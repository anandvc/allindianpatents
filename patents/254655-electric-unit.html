Description<br>
Title of the invention: Set comprising a plurality of cooler<br>
modules for assembly with a machine module<br>
Text: The invention relates to a set comprising a plurality of<br>
cooler modules, for assembly with a machine module.<br>
An electrical appliance having a machine module and a cooler<br>
module is known from JP 60-219 939 A. There, the electrical<br>
appliance has a heat exchanger through which a flow passes<br>
along a zigzag path, starting from the first cooling fluid<br>
connection zone, to the second cooling fluid connection zone.<br>
The cooling of known electrical appliances such as these in<br>
each case is matched to the machine module that is used. As<br>
soon as it is found that a specific cooling technique is no<br>
longer adequate for the machine module, the cooling for the<br>
electrical appliance must be completely redesigned.<br>
Further electrical appliances are known from JP 57-040344 A,<br>
JP 61-285039 A and WO 01/17094 Al.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a choice of<br>
cooling variants matched to the particular application, for a<br>
machine module, without having to make any design changes to<br>
the machine module for this purpose.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a set<br>
comprising a plurality of cooler modules as claimed in claim 1.<br>
The first cooler module variant allows open air cooling from<br>
both ends of the electrical machine. The second cooler module<br>
variant allows closed air cooling with a heat exchanger from<br>
both ends of the electrical machine. The third cooler module<br>
variant allows open air cooling flowing longitudinally through<br><br>
the electrical machine. The fourth cooler module variant allows<br>
closed air cooling flowing longitudinally through the<br><br>
electrical machine, with a heat exchanger. Depending on the<br>
ingress protection class of the electrical machine, it is then<br>
possible, for example to choose an open or closed type of<br>
cooling. A closed electrical machine can be operated with an<br>
air-air heat exchanger or with an air-water heat exchanger. The<br>
maximum cooling power based on VDE 0530 and thus the maximum<br>
machine power are achieved with an open machine with forced-<br>
draft ventilation and with air-water cooling. With a<br>
correspondingly reduced power, an air-air cooled machine offers<br>
the advantage of a closed type in combination with air cooling.<br>
Electrical machines are manufactured with different numbers of<br>
poles and are therefore designed for different rotation speeds.<br>
These machines can then the operated with a power supply system<br>
with a fixed rotation speed or from a converter with a variable<br>
rotation speed. Depending on the number of pole pairs and when<br>
converters are used for operation, it may also be advantageous,<br>
depending on the desired rotation-speed range, to cool the<br>
machine with the air flow from both ends, or from one end. In<br>
this case, the air resistance of the cooler module also plays<br>
an important role. Depending on the cooling type and number of<br>
pole pairs and the rotation speed it is possible according to<br>
the invention to choose the most efficient cooling variant with<br>
one and the same machine housing. Cooler modules with cooling<br>
air guides which do not require the third cooling fluid<br>
connection zone for the machine housing, seal them simply with<br>
the respective sealing device, so that the cooling air flows<br>
solely through the two remaining cooling fluid connection zones<br>
to the machine housing.<br>
A refinement of cooler module variants as claimed in claim 2 is<br>
particularly advantageous for cost-effective production of<br>
these cooler module variants. Alternatively it is possible to<br>
provide a tube connection in order to supply cooling air to the<br>
machine housing. When air is supplied at one end, that is to<br>
say it flows longitudinally through the electrical machine,<br><br>
the third cooling fluid connection zone is closed with the aid<br>
of the sealing device. In the case of air cooling of<br><br>
both ends, the air is supplied via tube connections to the<br>
first and second cooling fluid connection zone, and the air is<br>
carried away via the tube connection to the third cooling fluid<br>
connection zone.	<br>
Heat exchangers as claimed in claims 3 and 4 are adequate for<br>
many cooling requirements, even relatively demanding cooling<br>
requirements.<br>
The design of the machine housing of the machine module with<br>
three cooling fluid connection zones makes it possible to<br>
produce different variants of the cooling air guidance in the<br>
machine housing. These different cooling air guidance variants<br>
can then be combined with appropriate cooler modules, so that<br>
it is possible to take account of individual cooling<br>
requirements. The electrical appliance according to claim 5 can<br>
thus be equipped with different cooling techniques for the<br>
respective cooler module, without any need to make any physical<br>
changes for this purpose to the machine module, in particular<br>
without having to make any physical changes to the machine<br>
housing. By way of example, the following cooling techniques<br>
can be implemented with the same machine housing, just by<br>
adaptation of the cooler module: open air cooling from both<br>
ends of the electrical machine, closed air cooling with an air-<br>
air heat exchanger from both ends of the electrical machine,<br>
closed air cooling with an air-water heat exchanger from both<br>
ends of the electrical machine, open air cooling flowing<br>
longitudinally through the electrical machine, closed air<br>
cooling flowing longitudinally through the electrical machine<br>
with an air-air heat exchanger, closed air cooling flowing<br>
longitudinally through the electrical machine with an air-water<br>
heat exchanger. The cooler module either has only the function<br>
of cooling fluid guidance or includes active cooling elements<br>
such as heat exchangers. A standardized machine housing can be<br>
used for all of these cooling techniques. An electric motor, or<br><br>
alternatively  a  generator,  may be  used as  the  electrical<br>
machine.<br>
A machine housing as claimed in claim 6 provides effective<br>
stator cooling.	<br><br>
A machine housing as claimed in claim 7 allows cooling fluid guidance in which<br>
cooling fluid is not only supplied to or carried away from the ends of the<br>
machine, but is also passed via a central section of the machine housing. The<br>
cooling fluid can be supplied to this central section of the machine housing via<br>
the circulating and tangential cooling fluid flow component. This allows on the<br>
one hand cooling from both ends, and as well as cooling which flows through the<br>
machine from one end, on the other hand to be provided with one and the same<br>
machine housing.<br>
Webs as claimed in claim 8 offer a simple design capability to ensure a<br>
circulating cooling fluid flow.<br>
t<br>
Aperture openings in the webs as claimed in claim 9 result in defined tangential<br>
cooling fluid guidance.<br><br>
Air as the cooling fluid as claimed in claim 10 represents the simplest variant for<br>
cooling within the machine housing. Alternatively, it is also possible to use a<br>
different cooling fluid, in particular a cooling gas other than air. In principle, it is<br>
also possible to use a cooling liquid.<br><br>
A fan as claimed in claim 11 is advantageous when the rotor movement itself<br>
does not preset or does not adequately preset the desired flow direction of the<br>
cooling fluid.<br><br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be explained in more detail in the<br>
following text with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a detail of an electrical appliance having a<br>
machined module and a first cooler module variant, which represents part of a<br>
set comprising a plurality of cooler modules for assembly	<br><br>
FIGURE 2 shows a perspective view of a detail of a further<br>
electrical appliance having the machine module as<br>
shown in FIGURE 1 and of a second cooler module<br>
variant of the cooler module set, which has an air-<br>
air heat exchanger;<br>
FIGURES 3-6 show perspective views of a detail of the<br>
machine module as shown in FIGURE 1, with further<br>
cooler module variants, and<br>
FIGURE 7 shows a perspective, enlarged view, of a detail of a<br>
machine housing for the machine module.<br><br>
FIGURE 1 shows a perspective view of a detail of a drive<br>
appliance 1 as an example of an electrical appliance. This is a<br>
machine with a cooling circuit. The electrical appliance 1 has<br>
a motor module 2 illustrated at the bottom of FIGURE 1, as an<br>
example of a machine module. This has an electric motor 3 as an<br>
example of an electrical machine of which only a stator 4 to be<br>
precise the right-hand cutaway half of it, is illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 1. The stator 4 is in the form of a laminated core. As<br>
is known per se, the stator 4 has a plurality of aperture<br>
openings 5 through which fluid can flow radially through the<br>
stator 4. The rotor, which is not illustrated, also has<br>
corresponding aperture openings, which are known per se.<br>
Furthermore both the stator 4 and the rotor have passages 6<br>
which run both through the stator 4 and through the rotor in<br>
the axial direction and through which fluid can likewise flow.<br>
The electric motor 3 is accommodated in a machine or motor<br>
housing 7. The drawing shows only a vertically longitudinally<br>
sectioned rear half of this housing. The machine housing 7 has<br>
a first end wall 8, on the left in the drawing, and a second<br>
end wall 9 on the right in the drawing. Adjacent to the first<br>
end wall 8 and at a distance from it, the machine housing 7 has<br>
a first intermediate wall 10, in the left in the drawing.<br>
Adjacent to the second end wall 9, the machine housing 7 has a<br>
second intermediate wall 11, on the right in Figure 7. When the<br>
electric motor is assembled, an end shield which is not<br>
illustrated, in each case seals the electric motor 3 from the<br>
end walls 8, 9, such that it is not possible for any fluid to<br>
flow into or out of the machine housing 7 at the end, that is<br>
to say at the two ends of the electric motor 3. When the<br>
electric motor 3 is assembled, a casing wall 12 of the stator 4<br>
also rests on the intermediate walls 10, 11. The stator casing<br>
is sealed on the housing walls via guide walls, which are not<br>
illustrated. When the electric motor 3 is assembled, the<br>
machine housing 7 is thus subdivided into an axial central<br>
section 13<br><br>
between the two intermediate walls 10,  11 into a first edge<br>
section 14 which is shown on the left in the drawing<br><br>
between the first end wall 8 and the first intermediate wall<br>
10, and into a second edge section 15 which is shown on the<br>
right in FIGURE 7 between the second intermediate wall 11 and<br>
the second end wall 9.<br>
In the area of the central section 13, the machine housing 7<br>
has an octagonal cross section at right angles to its<br>
longitudinal axis. In the central section 13, the casing wall<br>
12 of the stator 4 rests on the machine housing 7 via webs 16<br>
which run axially between the intermediate walls 10, 11 and are<br>
firmly connected to a housing casing wall 17 of the machine<br>
housing 7. The external circumference of the stator 4 is fixed<br>
to the webs 16. The webs 16 have fluid aperture openings 18 at<br>
right angles to their extent direction and parallel to the<br>
adjacent section of the housing wall 17. In the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment, six aperture openings 18 are provided for<br>
each web 16.<br>
In FIGURE 1, a cooler module 19 of the electrical appliance 1<br>
is arranged above the machine housing 7 and is firmly connected<br>
to the machine module 2. The interior of a cooler housing 21 of<br>
the cooler module 19 is connected for fluid flow purposes to<br>
the first edge section 14 of the machine housing 7 via a first<br>
cooling fluid connection zone 20 in an upper section in the<br>
drawing, of the housing wall 17 which faces the cooler module<br>
19 and is formed at the cooler end by a cooling fluid supply<br>
opening. For this purpose, the cooler housing 21 has an<br>
aperture opening 22 in the bottom face in FIGURE 1, which is<br>
aligned with the first cooling fluid connection zone 20 of the<br>
machine housing 7. Furthermore, the machine housing 7 has a<br>
second cooling connection zone 23, which is likewise formed on<br>
the motor side by a cooling fluid aperture opening in that<br>
housing wall section of the machine housing 7 which faces the<br>
cooler module 19. The second edge section 15 of the machine<br>
housing 7 is connected for fluid flow purposes to the cooler<br>
housing 21 via the second cooling fluid connection zone 23.<br><br>
For this purpose, the cooler housing 21 has a further aperture<br>
opening 24, on the bottom face on the right in FIGURE 1.<br>
Furthermore, the machine housing 7 has a third<br><br>
cooling fluid connection zone 25 in the housing wall section<br>
which faces the cooler module 19. This is located between the<br>
first two cooling fluid connection zones 20, 23. The third<br>
cooling fluid connection zone is formed on the motor side in<br>
the upper wall section in the drawing, that is to say the wall<br>
section facing the cooler housing 21, of the central section 13<br>
which has an octagonal cross section, of the machine housing 7<br>
and is subdivided into a plurality, in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment into a total of 18, square aperture<br>
openings 2 6 arranged in a grid.<br>
The central section 13 is connected for fluid flow purposes to<br>
the interior of the cooler housing 21 via the third cooling<br>
fluid connection zone 25. For this purpose, on the bottom face,<br>
the cooler housing 21 has a central aperture opening 27 between<br>
the aperture openings 22 and 24.<br>
The interior of the cooler housing 21 is subdivided into a<br>
first cooler housing area 28, that is to say the upper cooling<br>
housing area in FIGURE 1 and into a second cooler housing area<br>
29 which is illustrated centrally at the bottom in FIGURE 1.<br>
The two cooling housing areas 28, 29 are separated from one<br>
another in a fluid-tight manner by a partition wall 30 in the<br>
form of a platform. The latter extends from a bottom<br>
intermediate web of the cooler housing 21 which is arranged<br>
between the aperture openings 22 and 27, to a further bottom<br>
intermediate web of the cooler housing 21 between the aperture<br>
openings 27 and 24. The first cooler housing area 28 is<br>
connected for fluid flow purposes on the one hand by the<br>
aperture openings 22 and 24 to the first cooling fluid<br>
connection zone 20, and on the other hand to the second cooling<br>
fluid connection zone 23. The second cooler housing area 29 is<br>
connected for fluid flow purposes via the aperture opening 27<br>
to the third cooling fluid connection zone 25. The first cooler<br>
housing area 28 is connected for fluid flow purposes to the<br>
area surrounding the cooler module 19 via inlet openings 31, 32<br><br>
which are arranged opposite one another at the ends. The second<br>
cooler housing area 29 is connected to the area surrounding the<br>
cooler module 19 via a bottom outlet opening 33. The outlet<br>
opening 33 is aligned with<br><br>
a cutout 34 in the housing section of the machine housing 7<br>
facing the cooler module 19, with this resulting from the<br>
octagonal cross section of the central section 13.<br>
Open air cooling of the electric motor 3 at both ends in the<br>
electrical appliance 1, as shown in FIGURE 1, operates as<br>
follows:<br>
Air is sucked in via the inlet openings 31, 32 into the first<br>
cooler housing area 28 of the cooler housing 21, as indicated<br>
by the flow direction arrows 35, 36 in FIGURE 1. A suction<br>
effect which results in this inward suction, is created by the<br>
rotation of the rotor on the electric motor 3 in the stator 4.<br>
The air that is sucked in passes through the first cooling<br>
fluid connection zone 20 and the second cooling fluid<br>
connection zone 23, that is to say on the one hand it enters<br>
the first edge section 14 of the machine housing 7 via the<br>
aperture openings 22 and 20, and on the other hand enters the<br>
second edge section 15 of the machine housing 7 via the<br>
aperture openings 24 and 23. As indicated by the direction of<br>
the flow arrows 37, 38, the cooling air enters the central<br>
section 13 of the machine housing 7 from there. In this case,<br>
the air flows from both ends of the electric motor 3 through<br>
the corresponding aperture openings and passages in the rotor<br>
and through the aperture openings 5 and the passages 6 in the<br>
stator 4. This therefore represents double-ended cooling of the<br>
electric motor 3. Furthermore, for example, the cooling air<br>
which emerges from the stator 4 passes over the outside of the<br>
casing wall 12 of the stator 4. The casing wall 12 is separated<br>
from the housing wall 17 by the webs 16, so that fluid can flow<br>
between the casing wall 12 and the housing wall 17. This<br>
provides efficient air-cooling for the rotor and the stator 4.<br>
In the central section 13, the cooling air can flow through the<br>
aperture openings 18 in the webs 16 to the aperture openings 26<br>
in the third cooling fluid connection zone 25, as indicated by<br><br>
the flow direction arrows 39,<br>
the webs 16 therefore allow<br>
cooling air flow between the<br>
wall 17. The cooling air which<br><br>
40. The aperture openings 18 in<br>
for circulating and tangential<br>
casing wall 12 and the housing<br>
transports the waste heat away<br><br>
enters the second cooling housing area 29 from the third<br>
cooling fluid connection zone 25 and flows out to the exterior<br>
again from the outlet opening 33, from this area, via the<br>
cutout 34.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows the machine module 2 with a second variant of a<br>
cooler module 41. The latter will be described in the following<br>
text only where it differs from the cooler module 19.<br>
Components which correspond to those which have already been<br>
explained above with reference to FIGURE 1 have the same<br>
reference numbers and will not be discussed in detail again.<br>
A cooler housing 42 of the cooler module 41 is subdivided into<br>
a first cooler housing section with two edge sections 43, 44 on<br>
the one hand, and the second cooler housing section 45 on the<br>
other hand. The edge sections 43, 44 of the cooler housing 42<br>
are arranged above the edge sections 14, 15 of the machine<br>
housing 7 in FIGURE 2. The edge section 43 is connected for<br>
fluid flow purposes via the aperture opening 22 to the aperture<br>
opening in the first cooling fluid connection zone 20 in the<br>
machine housing 7. The edge section 44 is connected for fluid<br>
flow purposes via the aperture opening 24 to the aperture<br>
opening in the second cooling fluid connection zone 23 of the<br>
machine housing 7. The second cooler housing section 45 is<br>
connected for fluid flow purposes via the aperture opening 27<br>
to the aperture openings 26 in the third cooling fluid<br>
connection zone 25 of the machine housing 7.<br>
Three supporting walls 48, 49, 50 are arranged parallel to end<br>
walls 46, 47 of the cooler housing 42, which are shown on the<br>
left and right in FIGURE 2 in the interior of the cooler<br>
housing 42. The first supporting wall 48, which is shown on the<br>
left in FIGURE 2, is mounted at the bottom on a supporting web<br>
of the cooler housing 42, which is arranged between the<br>
aperture openings 22 and 27. The supporting wall 48 separates<br>
the edge section 43, on the left in FIGURE 2, from the second<br><br>
cooler housing section 45. This separation is not complete,<br>
since the supporting wall 48 does not extend<br><br>
as far as the housing wall of the cooler housing 42 shown at<br>
the top in FIGURE 2. The second supporting wall 4 9 is mounted<br>
on the wall of the cooler housing 42 shown at the top in<br>
FIGURE 2, in the second cooler housing section 45. The second<br>
supporting wall 49 does not extend as far as the bottom of the<br>
cooler housing 42, so that the supporting wall 49 in the second<br>
cooler housing section 45 does not represent a barrier for<br>
cooling fluid. The third supporting wall 50 is mounted on a<br>
bottom supporting web of the cooler housing 42 which is<br>
arranged between the aperture openings 27 and 24, and its<br>
extend corresponds to that of the first supporting wall 48.<br>
Like the first supporting wall 48, the third supporting wall 50<br>
represents a subdivision, which can be overcome for cooling<br>
fluid between the second cooler housing section 45 and the edge<br>
section 44 on the right in FIGURE 2.<br>
Cooling air tubes 51 for secondary cooling air are supported by<br>
the end walls 46, 47 and the supporting walls 48 to 50 and<br>
passed through the cooler housing 42 parallel to the axis of<br>
the electric motor 3. In the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
FIGURE 2 there are a total of eighty cooling air tubes 51.<br>
These form an air-air heat exchanger 52.<br>
Closed air-circuit cooling is provided at both ends for the<br>
electrical appliance 1 shown in FIGURE 2 as follows:<br>
Primary cooling air enters the machine housing 7 via the first<br>
cooling fluid connection zone 20 and the second cooling fluid<br>
connection zone 23, as indicated by flow direction arrows 53,<br>
54 in FIGURE 2 . The further cooling air flow in the machine<br>
housing 7 in the electrical appliance 1 as shown in FIGURE 2<br>
corresponds to the cooling air flow for the cooling of the<br>
electrical appliance 1 shown in FIGURE 1 as indicated by the<br>
flow direction arrows 39, 40. After passing through the third<br>
cooling fluid connection zone 25, the cooling air which<br>
transports  the heat away enters the  second cooler housing<br><br>
section 45 of the cooler housing 42, as indicated by flow<br>
direction arrows 55. In the second cooler housing section 45<br>
and in the two edge sections 43, 44 of the first cooler housing<br><br>
section of the cooler housing 42, heat is now exchanged from<br>
the heat-emitting primary cooling air to the heat-receiving<br>
secondary cooling air which flows through cooling air tubes 51.<br>
The primary cooling air in this case bypasses the separating<br>
walls 48, 50 and once again flows in the direction of the first<br>
cooling fluid connection zone 20 on the one hand, and the<br>
second cooling fluid connection zone 23 on the other hand, as<br>
indicated by flow direction arrows 56, 57. This completes the<br>
cooling circuit of the primary cooling air. The flow direction<br>
of this cooling circuit results from the suction effect of the<br>
electric motor 3.<br>
A further variant of a cooler module 58 will be described in<br>
the following text with reference to FIGURE 3. The description<br>
covers only the differences between the cooler module 58 and<br>
the cooler module 41 shown in FIGURE 2. Components which<br>
correspond to those which have already been explained above<br>
with reference to FIGURES 1 and 2 have the same reference<br>
numbers and will not be discussed in detail again.<br>
Instead of an air-air heat exchanger, the cooler module 58 has<br>
an air-water heat exchanger 59. This has two laminate modules<br>
60, 61, which are illustrated schematically in FIGURE 3 as<br>
blocks with a rectangular cross section. As is known, for<br>
example, from motor vehicle radiators, the cooling laminates of<br>
the laminate modules 60, 61 through which cooling water flows<br>
are in the form of flat structures, which are all aligned<br>
essentially parallel to the main extent plane. This main extent<br>
plane is at the same time at right angles to the bottom of a<br>
cooler housing 62 of the cooler module 58, and on the other<br>
hand is at right angles to end walls 63, 64 of the cooler<br>
housing 62 with these being shown on the left and right in<br>
FIGURE 3. This alignment of the laminate results in the flows<br>
of the primary cooling air being impeded as little as possible.<br>
The water heat exchanger 59 is supported by a supporting wall<br>
65  in  the  form  of  a  platform.  A  contact  wall  66<br><br>
of the supporting wall 55 on which the water heat exchanger 59<br>
rests is designed such that air can pass through it, that is to<br>
say it has aperture openings for the primary cooling air.<br><br>
These aperture openings distinguish the supporting wall 65 from<br>
the separating wall 30 in the cooler housing 21 of the cooler<br>
module 19 shown in FIGURE 1. Otherwise, the form and the<br>
installation of the supporting wall 65 correspond to those for<br>
the separating wall 30. The supporting wall 65 separates a<br>
first cooler housing section of the cooler housing 62 with the<br>
edge sections 43, 44 from the second, central cooler housing<br>
section 67, which is bounded at the top by the supporting wall<br>
65 in FIGURE 3.<br>
Closed air-water cooling at both ends for the cooler module<br>
variant shown in FIGURE 3 operates as follows:<br>
The primary cooling air flow in the machine housing 7<br>
corresponds to that which has been described in conjunction<br>
with the cooler module 41 shown in FIGURE 2. The heated cooling<br>
air enters the second cooler housing section 67 of the cooler<br>
housing 62 from the third cooling fluid connection zone 25,<br>
from where it enters the laminate modules 60, 61 through the<br>
contact wall 66 as indicated by flow direction arrows 68, 69.<br>
In the laminate modules 60, 61, the cooling air emits its heat<br>
to the cooling water of the water heat exchanger 59 as it flows<br>
through the laminates. From the laminate modules 60, 61 the<br>
cooling air that has been cooled down flows into the edge<br>
sections 43, 44 of the cooler housing 62 from where it once<br>
again flows in the direction of the aperture openings 22, 24 as<br>
indicated by flow direction arrows 70, 71.<br>
A third variant of a cooler module 72 will be described in the<br>
following text with reference to FIGURE 4 in which case this<br>
third variant can be mounted on the machine module 2 in order<br>
to complete an electrical appliance 1 instead of the cooler<br>
modules 19, 41 and 58. Components of the cooler module 72 which<br>
correspond to those which have already been explained above in<br>
conjunction with FIGURES 1 to 3 have the same reference numbers<br>
and will not be discussed in detail again. A cooler housing 73<br><br>
of the cooler module	72 is subdivided into a first, bottom<br>
cooler housing area 74	and a second, cooler<br><br>
housing area 75, which is essentially arranged above it. The<br>
two cooler housing areas 74, 75 are separated from one another<br>
in a fluid-tight manner via a separating wall 7 6 within the<br>
cooler housing 73.<br>
The first cooler housing area 74 is connected for fluid flow<br>
purposes to the area surrounding the cooler module 72 via an<br>
inlet opening 77. The size and arrangement of the inlet<br>
arrangement 77 correspond to those of the outlet opening 33 of<br>
the cooler module 19 shown in FIGURE 1. The first cooler<br>
housing area 74 is connected for fluid flow purposes to the<br>
second cooling fluid connection zone 23 via the aperture<br>
opening 24.<br>
A section of the second cooler housing area 75 on the left in<br>
FIGURE 4 is connected for fluid flow purposes to the first<br>
cooling fluid connection zone 20 of the machine housing 7 via<br>
the aperture opening 22. The second cooler housing area 75 is<br>
connected to the area surrounding the cooler module 72 via an<br>
outlet opening 78. The size and arrangement of the outlet<br>
opening 78 correspond to those of the inlet opening 32 of the<br>
cooler housing 21 shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
The separating wall 76 has a first separating wall section 79,<br>
which is mounted on a bottom supporting web of the cooler<br>
housing 73 between the aperture opening 22 and the inlet<br>
opening 77, and rises steeply from the bottom, so that the<br>
second cooler housing area 75 initially widens continuously,<br>
starting from the aperture opening 22. A second separating wall<br>
section 80 of the separating wall 76 is adjacent to the first<br>
separating wall section 79. This is arranged such that it falls<br>
away slightly in the cooler housing 73 so that the second<br>
cooler housing area 75 widens continuously towards the outlet<br>
opening 78, starting from the connection between the two<br>
separating wall sections 79, 80.<br><br>
Apart from the bottom openings 22, 24 and 77, the bottom of the<br>
cooler housing 73 is in the form of a plate through which no<br>
fluid can pass. In particular, a sealing plate 81 is arranged<br>
above the third cooling fluid connection zone 25 of the machine<br><br>
housing 7 . The latter represents a sealing device which seals<br>
the third cooling fluid connection zone 25 in such a manner<br>
that no fluid can be exchanged between the machine module 2 and<br>
the cooler module 72 through this cooling fluid connection zone<br>
25.<br>
Open air cooling of the electrical appliance 1 at one end with<br>
the cooler module 72 operates as follows:<br>
Cooling air is sucked into the first cooler housing area 74<br>
from the outside via the inlet opening 77. The suction effect<br>
is once again produced by rotation of the rotor in the stator<br>
4. Alternatively, this suction effect can be produced or<br>
assisted by a fan. No such fan is illustrated in FIGURE 4 but,<br>
for example this may be in the form of a radial fan arranged in<br>
the first edge section 14 of the machine housing 7.<br>
Alternatively, an axial fan can also be provided. A flow<br>
direction arrow 82 indicates the entry of the cooling air into<br>
the inlet opening 77. From the inlet opening 77, the cooling<br>
air initially flows through the first cooler housing area 74 as<br>
indicated by a flow direction arrow 83, and from there through<br>
the aperture opening 24 and the second cooling fluid connection<br>
zone 23 into the second edge section 15 of the machine housing<br>
7, as indicated by a flow direction arrow 84. In FIGURE 4, the<br>
cooling air then flows from the right into the electric motor<br>
3, and flows through the aperture openings and passages in the<br>
rotor on the one hand as well as the aperture openings 5 and<br>
the passages 6 in the stator 4 on the other hand, as described<br>
in conjunction with the cooling air flow for cooling in<br>
FIGURE 1. Since the cooling air cannot escape upward through<br>
the third cooling fluid connection zone 25, the cooling air<br>
flows completely through the electric motor 3 axially from<br>
right to left in FIGURE 4 as indicated by flow direction arrows<br>
85, 86 and 87. This thus represents cooling of the electric<br>
motor 3 from one end. From the central section 13, the cooling<br>
air then flows into the first edge section 14 of the machine<br><br>
housing  7,  and  from  there  via  the  first  cooling  fluid<br>
connection zone<br><br>
20 and the aperture opening 22 into the second cooler housing<br>
area 75 of the cooler housing 73, as indicated by a flow<br>
direction arrow 88. The heated cooling air then flows from the<br>
aperture opening 22 through the continuously widening second<br>
cooler housing area 75 to the junction between the separating<br>
wall sections 79, 80 as indicated by a flow direction arrow 89,<br>
to the outlet opening 78, and from there out of the cooler<br>
housing 73.<br>
FIGURE 5 shows the electrical appliance 1 of a fourth variant<br>
of a cooler module 90, which can be mounted on the machine<br>
module 2. The design of the cooler module 90 will be described<br>
in the following text only where it differs from the design of<br>
the cooler module 41 shown in FIGURE 2. Components which<br>
correspond to those which have already been explained with<br>
reference to FIGURES 1 to 4, have the same reference numbers<br>
and will not be discussed in detail again. A cooler housing 91<br>
of the cooler module 90 does not have the aperture opening 27,<br>
but is closed by a sealing plate 92 . The latter therefore<br>
represents a sealing device which seals the third cooling fluid<br>
connection zone 25 of the machine housing 7, so that no fluid<br>
can be exchanged between the machine module 2 and the cooler<br>
module 90 through the third cooling fluid connection zone 25.<br>
A closed cooling air circuit from one end for primary cooling<br>
air has the following profile in the cooler module 90:<br>
The cooling air profile in the machine housing 7 in the<br>
embodiment of the electrical appliance 1 as shown in FIGURE 5<br>
corresponds to that in the embodiment shown in FIGURE 4, as<br>
indicated by the flow direction arrows 85, 86 and 87.<br>
Heated cooling air then enters the edge section 43 on the left<br>
in FIGURE 5, of the cooler housing 91 via the first cooling<br>
fluid connection zone 20 and the aperture opening 22. Heat is<br><br>
initially exchanged between the heated primary cooling air and<br>
the secondary cooling air in the edge section 43, which<br><br>
secondary cooling air flows through the cooling air tubes 51 of<br>
the air heat exchanger 52 of the cooler module 90. A flow<br>
direction arrow 93 indicates the heated cooling air entering<br>
the edge section 43.<br>
The cooling air which has been cooled down then bypasses the<br>
supporting wall 48 as indicated by a flow direction arrow 94,<br>
flows through the second cooler housing section 45, as<br>
indicated by a flow direction arrow 95, and then bypasses the<br>
supporting wall 50 as indicated by a flow direction arrow 96,<br>
with the cooling air that has now been cooled down flowing into<br>
the edge section 44 on the right in FIGURE 5. The cooling air<br>
that has been cooled down therefore then once again flows<br>
through the aperture opening 24 and the second cooling fluid<br>
connection zone 23 into the machine housing 7, thus closing the<br>
primary air circuit.<br>
FIGURE 6 shows a further variant of a cooler module 97 for<br>
mounting on the machine module 2 . Components which correspond<br>
to those which have already been explained above with reference<br>
to FIGURES 1 to 5 have the same reference numbers and will not<br>
be discussed in detail again. An air-water heat exchanger 99 is<br>
arranged in a cooler housing 98 of the cooler module 97,<br>
centrally and parallel to the end wall of the cooler housing<br>
91, as shown on the left and right in FIGURE 6. The air-water<br>
heat exchanger 99 has two laminate modules 100, 101. Air flows<br>
through the laminates of the laminate modules 100, 101. This<br>
cooling air itself exchanges heat with the cooling water which<br>
is flowing through cooling water tubes which are accommodated<br>
in the laminate modules 100, 101. These modules have laminates<br>
through which cooling water flows corresponding to the<br>
laminates in the water heat exchanger 59 in the embodiment<br>
shown in FIGURE 3. The main extent plane of the laminates of<br>
the water heat exchanger 99 in this case corresponds to that of<br>
the water heat exchanger 59. In principle, the embodiment of<br><br>
the water heat exchanger 59 shown in FIGURE 3 can also be used<br>
instead of the water heat exchanger 99.<br><br>
The water heat exchanger 99 subdivides the interior of the<br>
cooler housing 98 into a first cooler housing section 102,<br>
shown on the left in FIGURE 6, and a second cooler housing<br>
section 103, shown on the right in FIGURE 6. The first cooler<br>
housing section 102 is connected for fluid flow purposes via<br>
the aperture opening 22 to the first cooling fluid connection<br>
zone 20 of the machine housing 7. The second cooler housing<br>
section 103 is connected for fluid flow purposes via the<br>
aperture opening 24 to the second cooling fluid connection zone<br>
22 of the machine housing 7. A fluid connection is provided<br>
between the two cooler housing sections 102, 103 via the water<br>
heat exchanger 99.<br>
At the bottom, the cooler housing 91 of the cooler module 90<br>
has a sealing plate 104 between the aperture openings 22 and<br>
24. The latter represented a sealing device, which seals the<br>
third cooling fluid connection zone 25 of the machine housing<br>
7, such that no fluid can be exchanged between the machine<br>
module 2 and the cooler module 97 through the third cooling<br>
fluid connection zone 25.<br>
Air-water circuit cooling from one end is provided with the<br>
cooler module 97 for the electrical appliance 1 shown in<br>
FIGURE 6 as follows:<br>
The air flow in the machine housing 7 in the embodiment shown<br>
in FIGURE 6 corresponds to that in the embodiment shown in<br>
FIGURES 4 and 5, as indicated by the flow direction arrows 85,<br>
86 and 87. The heated cooling air enters the first cooler<br>
housing section 102 from the first edge section 14 via the<br>
first cooling fluid connection zone 20 and the aperture opening<br>
22, as indicated by a flow direction arrow 105. From the first<br>
cooler housing section 102, the cooling air passes through the<br>
water heat exchanger 99, during which process it is cooled down<br>
by exchanging heat with the cooling air and the water, which is<br>
flowing through the laminate modules 100, 101. The cooling air<br><br>
that has been cooled down then flows from the second cooler<br>
housing section 103 through the aperture opening 24<br><br>
and the second cooling fluid connection zone 23 into the second<br>
edge section 15 of the machine housing 7. This completes the<br>
cooling circuit for the primary cooling air.<br>
The various variants of cooler modules 19, 41, 58, 72, 90, 97<br>
represent a set, in which case, optionally a cooler module 19,<br>
41, 58, 72, 90, 97 forming this set can be mounted on the<br>
machine module 2, whose design on the housing side is always<br>
the same, depending on the cooling requirements and the<br>
existing circumstances.<br>
Wherever an aperture opening for connection to the outside is<br>
provided for the primary cooling air guides as described above,<br>
this can be designed such that it is protected against the<br>
ingress of water and dust.<br>
As an alternative to or in addition to the aperture openings 18<br>
in the webs 16, a tangential flow of cooling fluid between the<br>
stator casing 12 and the housing wall 17 can be achieved by the<br>
webs 16 being shaped such that the stator casing 12 rests on it<br>
only in places, so that intermediate spaces are created between<br>
the stator casing 12 and the webs 16, allowing a tangential<br>
flow through them.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A SET COMPRISING A PLURALITY OF COOLER MODULES FOR<br>
ASSEMBLY WITH A MACHINE MODULE<br>
The invention relates to an electric unit (1) which comprises a machine module (2)<br>
provided with an electric machine (3) comprising a stator (4) and a rotor. A machine<br>
housing (7) of the machine module (2) receives the electric machine (3). A cooling<br>
module (19) comprises a cooling housing (21), which is fluidically connected to the<br>
machine housing (7) by means of a first cooling fluid connection area (20) in a housing<br>
wall (17) of the machine housing (7) and to at least one second cooling fluid connection<br>
area (23) in the housing wall (17) of the machine housing (7). The inside of the machine<br>
housing (7) can be fluidically connected to the inside of the cooling housing (21) in one<br>
section of the housing wall (17), which is oriented towards the cooling housing (21), by<br>
means of at least one third cooling fluid connection area (25) comprising at least one<br>
cooling fluid through-opening (26). Various cooling module variants can use said third<br>
cooling fluid connection area (25) when other cooling module variants, which can be<br>
used in exchange with the cooling module (19) in the machine module (2), do not use the<br>
third cooling fluid connection area (25). As a result, an electric unit (1), a machine<br>
module (2) therefore and a set comprising a plurality of different cooling modules, which<br>
can meet altered cooling requirements having reduced structural and constructural costs,<br>
can be produced.</td>
