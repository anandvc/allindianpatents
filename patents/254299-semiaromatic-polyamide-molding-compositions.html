DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to polyamide molding<br>
compositions based on a terephthalic acid copolyamide and to<br>
processes for their preparation, and to uses thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Known standard polyamides, such as PA6 and PA66, are easy to<br>
process, and have high melting points and high heat deflection<br>
temperatures, particularly when they have glass-fiber<br>
reinforcement or comprise mineral fillers. However, they<br>
typically have high water absorptions up to 10% on storage in<br>
water. For many applications with stringent requirements for<br>
dimensional stability, including under wet or moist<br>
conditions, these aliphatic polyamides cannot be used. Water<br>
absorption alters not only dimensions but also mechanical<br>
properties. Water absorption reduces stiffness values and<br>
strength values to a fraction of their previous levels. In<br>
other words, problems arise when the standard polyamides are<br>
used in applications with mechanical load in contact with<br>
water or ambient moisture.<br>
Long-chain aliphatic polyamides composed of aminoundecanoic<br>
acid (PA11) or laurolactam (PA12), or composed of<br>
dodecanediamine and dodecanedioic acid (PA1212) have low water<br>
absorption but have undesirably low melting points below<br>
200°C. PAll, PA12, and PA1212 have low modulus and strength,<br>
even when dry. They are unsuitable for technical applications<br>
at relatively high temperatures.<br><br><br>
Semiaromatic polyamides of PA6T/6I type, as described<br>
in US 4,607,073 have reduced water absorption when<br>
compared with PA6 and PA66, and mechanical properties<br>
are substantially retained after water absorption.<br>
However, water absorption is still too high for<br>
precision parts (swelling), melting points are likewise<br>
too high, and the use of isophthalic acid markedly<br>
lowers crystallinity and crystallization rate, and<br>
there are problems with processability.<br>
On the other hand, PA10T, as likewise disclosed in<br>
US 4,607,073, has markedly reduced water absorption,<br>
and mechanical properties do not change on storage in<br>
water. The material is highly crystalline, and<br>
crystallizes very rapidly, a result being freezing<br>
within the nozzle during injection molding. Glass-<br>
fiber-reinforced PA10T has very irregular surfaces.<br>
Semiaromatic polyamides of PA6T/NDT/INDT type, as<br>
described in US 4,617,342, or of PA6T/6I/66 type as<br>
described in USRE34447E, or of PA6T/6/66 type as in<br>
EP 0 299 444, or of PA6T/MPMDT type as in EP 0 522 027<br>
and EP 0 561 886 have reduced water absorption when<br>
comparison is made with PA6 and PA66, and mechanical<br>
properties are retained after water absorption.<br>
However, here again water absorption is still too high<br>
for precision parts (swelling). According to<br>
US 5,098,940, the polyphthalamides of the US RE34447E<br>
mentioned and of the likewise abovementioned<br>
US 4,617,342 also have long cycle times in injection<br>
molding and require high mold temperatures which cannot<br>
be achieved using water-heated molds.<br>
The specification EP 0 659 799, EP 0 976 774,<br>
EP 1 186 634, and EP 1 375 578 describe semiaromatic<br>
polyamides composed of from 60 to 100 mol% of<br>
terephthalic acid and from 60 to 100 mol% of a diamine<br>
component composed of 1,9-nonanediamine and 2-methyl-<br><br><br>
1,8-octanediamine. These products feature good<br>
processability, excellent crystallinity, good heat<br>
deflection temperature, low water absorption, good<br>
chemicals resistance, and dimensional stability, and<br>
toughness. However, 2-methyl-1,8-octanediamine is<br>
currently not listed in the regulations either for<br>
existing substances or for new substances, and is<br>
therefore not approved in Europe. This inhibits rapid<br>
product introduction in the European market.<br>
The documents EP 1 710 482, EP 1 741 549, and<br>
EP 1 741 553 claim multilayer pipes and multilayer<br>
hoses for the transport of chemicals and/or gases at<br>
high temperatures and multilayer structures with a<br>
semiaromatic polyamide composed of from 60 to 100 mol%<br>
of an aliphatic diamine having from 9 to 13 carbon<br>
atoms and from 50 to 100 mol% of terephthalic acid<br>
and/or naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. The examples use<br>
PA9T, PA9N, PA12T, and PA12N, in each case with<br>
100 mol% of aliphatic diamine having from 9 to 12<br>
carbon atoms. The description points out that other<br>
diamines, e.g. hexamethylenediamine, can be used within<br>
a range in which the excellent properties of the<br>
multilayer tubes, multilayer pipes, or multilayer<br>
structures are not impaired, and in an amount which is<br>
preferably 10 mol% or less.<br>
EP 0 368 281 involves blends of ethylene-glycidyl<br>
methacrylate copolymer optionally with polyarylate and<br>
with a polyamide, prepared from an aliphatic or<br>
alicyclic diamine and from an aromatic dicarboxylic<br>
acid. Terephthalic acid is particularly emphasized as<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acid. In relation to the<br>
aliphatic, linear or branched diamine having from 4 to<br>
25 carbon atoms, said document mentions an enormous<br>
variety of possibilities. In the context of the<br>
enormous variety of possibilities mentioned, there is<br>
no express indication that the individual members of<br><br><br>
said list can also be used in the form of a mixture. If<br>
the specific examples in said document are examined, it<br>
is found that they disclose exclusively systems based<br>
on 1,6-hexanediamine, terephthalic acid, and<br>
isophthalic acid, or adipic acid (PA6T/6I and PA6T/66).<br>
EP 0 697 429 very generally describes copolyamides<br>
based on aliphatic diamines having from 4 to 14 carbon<br>
atoms and terephthalic acid, having a particular<br>
distribution of the segments. Said document gives a<br>
wide variety of possibilities with regard to the<br>
selection of the diamine. Preferred diamines are 1,6-<br>
hexanediamine, 2-methyl-1,5-pentanediamine (MPMD), and<br>
1,12-dodecanediamine. Preferred polyamides are PA6T/6I,<br>
PA6T/66, PA6T/6, PA6T/66/6I, PA6T/66/6, PA12T/66,<br>
PA12T/126, PA12T/6I, PA12T/12I, and PA12T/6. When the<br>
specific examples are examined, they reveal only<br>
systems with 1,6-hexanediamine, terephthalic acid,<br>
adipic acid and caprolactam.<br>
US 3,839,296 involves very generally systems of xT<br>
structure, where an enormous list is given for the<br>
diamine x. In the specific examples the only compound<br>
cited is always x = 1,12-dodecanediamine.<br>
The abstract of JP 2002293926 involves providing a<br>
copolyamide in which the diamine (component a)<br>
comprises 1,10-diaminodecane and in which, on the other<br>
hand, the diacid always comprises terephthalic acid<br>
and, if appropriate, comprises further systems, an<br>
example being a further aromatic diacid differing from<br>
terephthalic acid, or C4-20 diacids. A large list of<br>
possible diamines is moreover cited as replacement for<br>
1,10-decanediamine, but no specific indication is given<br>
of use of a combination (mixture) . The specific<br>
examples always use only 1,10-decanediamine. There is a<br>
single example (comparative example 3) that uses<br>
another diamine, replacing 1,10-decanediamine<br><br><br>
completely by 1,6-hexanediamine in combination with<br>
terephthalic acid and adipic acid.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is therefore based inter alia on the<br>
object of providing a polyamide molding composition<br>
improved over the prior art not only with respect to<br>
mechanical properties, including under wet or moist<br>
conditions, but also with respect to processing<br>
possibilities. A further intention was to provide<br>
moldings based on this molding composition, and<br>
processes for the preparation of this molding<br>
composition.<br>
Accordingly, a polyamide molding composition with the<br>
following constitution is presently and specifically<br>
proposed:<br>
(A)	from 30 to 100% by weight of at least one<br>
10T/6T copolyamide, where this is composed of<br>
(A1) from 40 to 95 mol% of 10T units, formed<br>
from the monomers 1,10-decanediamine and<br>
terephthalic acid<br>
(A2) from 5 to 60 mol% of 6T units, formed<br>
from the monomers 1,6-hexanediamine and<br>
terephthalic acid<br>
(B)	from 0 to 70% by weight of reinforcing<br>
materials and/or fillers<br>
(C)	from 0 to 50% by weight of additives and/or<br>
further polymers<br>
where the entirety of components A to C is 100%.<br>
Up to 30% of the monomers within component (A) can be<br>
replaced here, and this means that the above applies<br>
firstly with the proviso that in component (A) ,<br>
independently of one another, in (Al) and/or (A2) up to<br>
30 mol%, based on the entirety of the dicarboxylic<br><br><br>
acids, of the terephthalic acid can have been replaced<br>
by other aromatic, aliphatic, or cycloaliphatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids having from 6 to 36 carbon atoms.<br>
Secondly, furthermore, the above applies with the<br>
proviso that in component (A) , independently of one<br>
another, in (A1) and/or (A2) up to 30 mol% of 1,10-<br>
decanediamine and respectively 1,6-hexanediamine, based<br>
on the entirety of the diamines, can have been replaced<br>
by other diamines having from 4 to 36 carbon atoms.<br>
Finally, the above moreover applies with the proviso<br>
that not more than 30 mol% in component (A) , based on<br>
the entirety of the monomers, can have been formed via<br>
lactams or amino acids.<br>
However, it is preferable that this replacement of the<br>
monomers within component (A) in accordance with the<br>
above provisos amounts to less than 20%, and preferably<br>
less than 10%, and it is particularly preferable to use<br>
no such replacement at all. A further proviso that<br>
applies overall is therefore that the concentration of<br>
the entirety of the monomers which replace terephthalic<br>
acid, 1,6-hexanediamine, and 1,10-decanediamine (i.e.<br>
the total proportion of other aromatic, aliphatic, or<br>
cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 6 to 36<br>
carbon atoms, and of other diamines having from 4 to 36<br>
carbon atoms, and of lactams or aminoacids) does not<br>
exceed 30 mol%, preferably 20 mol%, in particular<br>
10 mol%, based on the entirety of the monomers used in<br>
component A.<br>
It has specifically and unexpectedly been found that<br>
precisely the abovementioned ratios of the individual<br>
components in the copolyamide lead to particular<br>
properties. For example, it has been found that below a<br>
concentration of 40 mol% of 10T the melting points of<br>
the 10T/6T copolyamides rise rapidly, thus preventing<br><br><br>
satisfactory processing of said compositions. The<br>
proposed constitution leads to excellent mechanical<br>
properties even under wet or moist conditions, and<br>
unexpectedly high heat deflection temperatures are<br>
achieved, particularly when reinforcing fibers are also<br>
used.<br>
The prior art does not particularly recommend the<br>
specific combination of 1,10-decanediamine and 1,6-<br>
hexanediamine, and there is certainly no indication in<br>
the prior art of the specific molar ratios which can<br>
provide the favorable properties presently found. Still<br>
less is known from the prior art about the low water<br>
absorption of a PA10T/6T combination, and nor is it<br>
known from the prior art that this PA10T/6T combination<br>
together with reinforcing fibers has high heat<br>
deflection temperatures above 260°C.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a polyamide<br>
molding composition with the following properties:<br>
-	high heat deflection temperature (melting<br>
point above 270°C or HDT A greater than 260°C<br>
for a PA reinforced with 50% of glass fibers)<br>
-	good processability (melting point below 320°<br>
C; crystallization behavior)<br>
-	low water absorption (
water at 95°C)<br>
-	unaltered mechanical properties after water<br>
absorption (e.g. wet tensile modulus of<br>
elasticity &gt; 100% of dry tensile modulus of<br>
elasticity, wet yield strength or wet<br>
breaking strength &gt; 85% of dry yield strength<br>
or dry breaking strength)<br>
-	good surface quality of glass-fiber-<br>
reinforced products<br>
high dimensional stability.<br><br><br>
A first preferred embodiment is therefore one wherein<br>
the melting point and respectively the temperature of<br>
deflection to ISO-R 75, method A (DIN 53 461) of<br>
component (A) and/or of the entire polyamide molding<br>
composition is above 260°C or above 270°C, preferably<br>
in the range from 270 to 320°C, particularly preferably<br>
in the range from 270 to 310°C.<br>
The ratios are moreover preferably adjusted in such a<br>
way that the water sbsorption of component (A) and/or<br>
of the entire polyamide molding composition is less<br>
than 5% by weight, preferably less than 4% by weight<br>
and in particular less than 3.5% by weight, e.g. after<br>
240 h in water at 95°C.<br>
It has moreover been found to be advantageous that the<br>
ratio of wet:dry tensile moduli of elasticity is<br>
greater than or equal to 0.95, preferably greater than<br>
or equal to 1.00, with particular preference greater<br>
than or equal to 1.05. It is likewise advantageous that<br>
the ratio of wet:dry maximum tensile strengths is<br>
greater than or equal to 0.85, preferably greater than<br>
0.90, with particular preference greater than or equal<br>
to 0.95. The maximum tensile strength corresponds to<br>
the maximum strength in the tensile strain graph<br>
determined to ISO 527.<br>
For adequately high molecular weight and high relative<br>
viscosity, together with good flowability and high MVR<br>
(melt volume flow rate), it has proven advantageous<br>
that the monomers used are adequately pure. In<br>
particular in the case of the diamine, it is<br>
advantageous to establish high purity, and it is<br>
therefore preferable that the melting point of the<br>
1,10-decanediamine used is above 63°C and/or that its<br>
total diamine content is above 99%, and/or that its<br>
aminonitrile content is below 0.5 percent, and/or that<br><br><br>
its APHA (American Public Health Association color<br>
index) color is below 10 units.<br>
As in particular can be discerned from the graphs given<br>
below, it has proven advantageous with regard to ideal<br>
adjustment of melting point and respectively with<br>
regard to water absorption that, within components (A),<br>
the (A1) fractions make up from 40 to 90 mol% and that<br>
the (A2) fractions make up from 10 to 60 mol%.<br>
Particular preference is given here to the following<br>
ratio: (A1) from 40 to 80 mol% and (A2) from 20 to<br>
60 mol%, a particular ratio being the following: (Al)<br>
from 40 to 75 mol% and (A2) from 25 to 60 mol%.<br>
As explained above, it is preferable that the 10T/6T<br>
copolyamide of component (A) is based in essence<br>
exclusively, preferably completely exclusively, on<br>
terephthalic acid as dicarboxylic acid, and/or that the<br>
10T/6T copolyamide of component (A) is based in essence<br>
exclusively, preferably completely exclusively, on<br>
1,10-decanediamine for (Al) and 1,6-hexanediamine for<br>
(A2) as diamine, and/or that component (A) is composed<br>
in essence exclusively, preferably completely<br>
exclusively, of the constituents (Al) and (A2).<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, component<br>
(B) involves at least to some extent glass fibers<br>
and/or carbon fibers. Component (C) normally and<br>
generally involves additives and/or further polymers,<br>
for example selected from the following group: impact<br>
modifiers, adhesion promoters, crystallization<br>
accelerators or crystallization retarders, flow aids,<br>
lubricants, mold-release agents, plasticizers,<br>
stabilizers, processing aids, flame-retardant<br>
additions, pigments, dyes and markers, antistatic<br>
agents, nanoparticles in lamellar form, conductivity<br>
additives, such as carbon black, graphite powder, or<br>
carbon nanofibrils, residues from polymerization<br><br><br>
processes, e.g. catalysts, salts and their derivatives,<br>
and regulators, such as monoacids or monoamines.<br>
In another embodiment, the inventive molding<br>
composition also comprises moreover from 8 to 25% by<br>
weight, preferably from 10 to 22% by weight, and in<br>
particular from 10 to 18% by weight, of a flame<br>
retardant (as one constituent of component (C) or<br>
forming said component (C) in its entirety) . The flame<br>
retardant is preferably halogen-free.<br>
The flame retardant in component (C) or forming<br>
component (C) in its entirety preferably encompasses<br>
here from 60 to 100% by weight, with preference from 70<br>
to 98% by weight, particularly from 80 to 96% by<br>
weight, of a phosphinic salt and/or diphosphinic salt<br>
(component (C1) ) and from 0 to 4 0% by weight,<br>
preferably from 2 to 30% by weight, in particular from<br>
4 to 20% by weight, of a nitrogen-containing synergist<br>
and/or of a nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing flame<br>
retardant (component (C2)).<br>
Component (C2) preferably involves melamine or<br>
condensates of melamine, e.g. melem, melam, or melon,<br>
or reaction products of melamine with polyphosphoric<br>
acid, or involves reaction products of condensates of<br>
melamine with polyphosphoric acid, or involves a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
Melamine polyphosphate is particularly preferred as<br>
component (C2) . These flame retardants are known from<br>
the prior art. Reference is made in this connection to<br>
DE 103 46 3261, and the disclosure of said<br>
specification is expressly incorporated herein in this<br>
regard.<br>
A phosphinic salt of the general formula (I) and/or<br>
formula (II) and/or their polymers is preferred as<br><br>
component (C1)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 are identical or different and are preferably<br>
C1-C8-alkyl, linear or branched, and/or aryl;<br>
R3 is C1-C10-alkylene, linear or branched, or<br>
C6-C10-arylene or -alkylarylene, or<br>
arylalkylene;<br>
M is a metal ion from the 2nd or 3rd main or<br>
transition group of the Periodic Table of the<br>
Elements; and<br>
m is 2 or 3;<br>
n is 1 or 3;<br>
x is 1 or 2.<br>
The metal ion M used preferably comprises Al, Ca, and<br>
Zn.<br>
In combination with the flame-retardant components (C1)<br>
and (C2), it is also possible, if appropriate, to add<br>
from 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the entirety of (C1)<br>
and (C2), of oxygen-, nitrogen-, or sulfur-containing<br>
metal compounds, as stabilizers (component (C3)).<br>
Metals preferred here are aluminum, calcium, magnesium,<br>
and zinc. Suitable compounds are those selected from<br>
the group of the oxides, hydroxides, carbonates,<br>
silicates, borates, phosphates, and stannates, and<br>
combinations and mixtures of said compounds, e.g. oxide<br><br><br>
hydroxides or oxide hydroxide carbonates. Examples are<br>
magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc<br>
oxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
boehmite, dihydrotalcite, hydrocalumite, calcium<br>
hydroxide, tin oxide hydrate, zinc hydroxide, zinc<br>

zinc stearate, magnesium stearate, potassium palmitate,<br>
magnesium behenate.<br>
Another factor that should therefore be emphasized for<br>
the inventive polyamide molding compositions and<br>
respectively for the moldings produced therefrom is<br>
that excellent flame retardancy is achieved in<br>
combination with the exceptional properties described<br>
above. The UL classification of the molding<br>
composition, for a test specimen of thickness 0.8 mm,<br>
is V-0 (UL 94, test to standards from Underwriters<br>
Laboratories (U.L.), cf. www.ulstandards.com).<br>
The invention further provides a short-fiber-reinforced<br>
pelletized material, a long-fiber-reinforced elongate<br>
pelletized material, or a semifinished product, or a<br>
molding, composed of a polyamide molding composition as<br>
described above, further details of which are also<br>
described at a later stage below, particularly<br>
preferably for use in a moist and/or wet environment.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the<br>
preparation of a polyamide molding composition as<br>
described above and further details of which are also<br>
described at a later stage below, where said process<br>
preferably comprises adding, to the monomer mixtures,<br>
during the preparation of component (A) , at least one<br>
polycondensation catalyst, preferably in a proportion<br>
of from 0.005 to 1.5% by weight, where this can by way<br>
of example involve phosphorus compounds, such as<br><br><br>
phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, hypophosphorous<br>
acid, phenylphosphonic acid, phenylphosphinic acid,<br>
and/or salts thereof with cations of valency from 1 to<br>
3, e.g. Na, K, Mg, Ga, Zn, or Al, and/or their esters,<br>
such as triphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphite, or<br>
tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite, or a mixture thereof.<br>
With regard to the dicarboxylic acids which, if<br>
appropriate, replace the terephthalic acid, the<br>
following applies: the inventive semiaromatic PA10T/6T<br>
copolyamides (A) contain this, as dicarboxylic acid, in<br>
a molar ratio which is in particular from 40 to 95/from<br>
5 to 60, the material being in essence terephthalic<br>
acid. Some of the terephthalic acid can have been<br>
replaced by a subordinate amount, preferably not more<br>
than 30 mol% (based on the entire amount of the<br>
dicarboxylic acids) of other aromatic, aliphatic, or<br>
cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 6 to 36<br>
carbon atoms. Among the suitable aromatic dicarboxylic<br>
acids are naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (NDA) and<br>
isophthalic acid (IPS). Suitable aliphatic dicarboxylic<br>
acids are adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid,<br>
sebacic acid, undecanedioic acid, dodecanedioic acid,<br>
brassylic acid, tetradecanedioic acid, pentadecanedioic<br>
acid, hexadecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, and<br>
dimer acid. Suitable cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids<br>
are cis- and/or trans-cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid<br>
and/or cis- and/or trans-cyclohexane-1,3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid (CHDA).<br>
With regard to the diamines which, if appropriate,<br>
replace 1,6-hexanediamine and respectively 1,10-<br>
decanediamine, the following applies: the inventive,<br>
semiaromatic PA10T/6T copolyamides (A) contain in<br>
essence a mixture composed of 1,6-hexanediamine and<br>
1,10-decanediamine in a molar ratio of from 5/95 to<br>
60/40. It is also possible that a subordinate amount,<br>
which is preferably not more than 30 mol% (based on the<br><br><br>
entire amount of the diamines) of the diamines has been<br>
replaced by other diamines having from 4 to 36 carbon<br>
atoms. Examples of linear or branched, aliphatic<br>
diamines are 1,4-butanediamine, 1,5-pentanediamine, 2-<br>
methyl-1,5-pentanediamine (MPMD), 1,8-octanediamine<br>
(OMDA), 1,9-nonanediamine (NMDA), 2-methyl-1,8-octane-<br>
diamine (MODA), 2,2,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine<br>
(TMHMD), 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine (TMHMD),<br>
5-methyl-1,9-nonanediamine, 1,11-undecanediamine, 2-<br>
butyl-2-ethyl-1, 5-pentanediamine, 1,12-dodecanediamine,<br>
1,13-tridecanediamine, 1,14-tetradecanediamine, 1,16-<br>
hexadecanediamine, and 1,18-octadecanediamine. Examples<br>
of cycloaliphatic diamines that can be used are cyclo-<br>
hexanediamine, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane (BAC),<br>
isophoronediamine,	norbornanedimethylamine,<br>
4,4' -diaminodicyclohexylmethane (PACM), 2,2-<br>
(4,4'-diaminodicyclohexyl)propane (PACP), and<br>
3,3' -dimethyl-4,4' -diaminodicyclohexylmethane (MACM).<br>
m-Xylylenediamine (MXDA) may be mentioned as<br>
araliphaticdiamine.<br>
With respect to the lactams and amino acids which can<br>
also be present, if appropriate, in component (A) , the<br>
following applies: the inventive, semiaromatic PA10T/6T<br>
copolyamides (A) can contain not only 1,6-<br>
hexanediamine, 1,10-decanediamine, and terephthalic<br>
acid (taking into account the at least optional partial<br>
replacements discussed above for these constituents)<br>
but also a subordinate amount, which is preferably not<br>
more tham 30 mol% (based on the entire amount of the<br>
monomers) of lactams or amino acids. Examples of<br>
suitable compounds are caprolactam (CL) , α,ω-<br>
aminocaproic acid, α,ω-aminononanoic acid, α,ω-<br>
aminoundecanoic acid (AUA) , laurolactam (LL) , and ω-<br>
aminododecanoic acid (ADA).<br>
For higher glass transition temperatures, preference is<br>
given to additions of NDA, IPS, CHDA, MPMD, MODA,<br><br><br>
TMHMD, BAC, PACM, and MACM. NDA, BAC, and PACM are<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
For lower glass transition temperatures, preference is<br>
given to additions of long-chain monomers, such as<br>
dodecanedioic acid, brassylic acid, tetradecanedioic<br>
acid, pentadecanedioic acid, hexadecanedioic acid,<br>
octadecanedioic acid, dimer acid, 1,12-dodecanediamine,<br>
1,13-tridecanediamine, 1,14-tetradecanediamine, 1,16-<br>
hexadecanediamine, and 1,18-octadecanediamine.<br>
Dodecanedioic acid and 1,12-dodecanediamine are<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
For adequately high molecular weight and high relative<br>
viscosity, together with good flowability and high MVR,<br>
the monomers used should preferably have adequate<br>
purity. In particular in the case of 1,10-<br>
decanediamine, it is advantageous that melting point is<br>
above 63°C, total diamine content is above 99%,<br>
aminonitrile content is below 0.5%, and APHA color is<br>
below 10 units.<br>
Polycondensation catalysts that can be added to the<br>
monomer mixtures are from 0.005 to 1.5% by weight of<br>
phosphorus compounds, such as phosphoric acid<br>
phosphorous acid, hypophosphorous acid,<br>
phenylphosphonic acid, phenylphosphinic acid, and/or<br>
salts thereof with cations of valency from 1 to 3, e.g.<br>
Na, K, Mg, Ga, Zn, or Al, and/or their esters, such as<br>
triphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphite, or tris<br>
(nonylphenyl) phosphite. Preference is given to<br>
hypophosphorous acid and sodium hydrogen hypophosphite<br>
monohydrate in an amount of from 100 to 500 ppm of<br>
phosphorus, based on the semiaromatic PA10T/6T<br>
copolyamide (A).<br>
Because diamine compounds are more volatile than<br>
dicarboxylic acids, diamine loss occurs during the<br><br><br>
preparation process. Diamine is lost during evaporation<br>
of the water, during discharge of the precondensate,<br>
and during the post-condensation in the melt or in the<br>
solid phase. To compensate the diamine loss, therefore,<br>
it is preferable that a diamine excess of from 1 to 8%<br>
by weight, based on the entirety of the diamines, is<br>
added to the monomer mixture. The diamine excess is<br>
also used to regulate the molecular weight and the<br>
distribution of the end groups. In the process used<br>
according to the examples, a diamine excess of smaller<br>
than 3% gives a carboxy end group excess of from 10 to<br>
150 mmol/kg. A diamine excess of more than 3% produces<br>
an amino end group excess of from 10 to 150 mmol/kg.<br>
Regulators in the form of monocarboxylic acids or of<br>
monoamines can be added to the mixture and/or to the<br>
precondensate (prior to post-condensation) in order to<br>
regulate the molar mass, the relative viscosity or<br>
respectively the flowability or the MVR. Aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic, or aromatic monocarboxylic acids or<br>
monoamines suitable as regulators are acetic acid,<br>
propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic<br>
acid, lauric acid, stearic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid,<br>
cyclohexanoic acid, benzoic acid, butylamine,<br>
pentylamine, hexylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine, n-<br>
octylamine, n-dodecylamine, n-tetradecylamine, n-<br>
hexadecylamine, stearylamine, cyclohexylamine, 3-<br>
(cyclohexylamino)propylamine, methylcyclohexylamine,<br>
dimethylcyclohexylamine, benzylamine, 2-<br>
phenylethylamine, etc. The regulators can be used<br>
individually or in combination. It is also possible to<br>
use, as regulators, other monofunctional compounds<br>
which can react with an amino or acid group, e.g.<br>
anhydrides, isocyanates, acyl halides or esters. The<br>
usual amount used of the regulators is from 10 to<br>
200 mmol per kg of polymer.<br>
In order to obtain a mixture which is homogeneous and<br><br><br>
can be stirred even at an early stage, it is<br>
advantageous to admix water with the monomer mixture.<br>
The amount of water can be from 5 to 50% by weight,<br>
based on the entire mixture. The water can be added<br>
together with the diamines in the form of aqueous<br>
solutions of the diamines, or together with the<br>
dicarboxylic acid in the form of an aqueous slurry, or<br>
separately. The molecular weight and the bulk density<br>
of the precondensate can be controlled via the amount<br>
of water and the pressure set (at which the water is<br>
evaporated), and the residence time.<br>
The molding compositions can moreover be modified using<br>
up to 70% by weight of fillers and reinforcing<br>
materials (glass fibers and/or carbon fibers (including<br>
graphite fibers)). Short fibers (e.g. chopped glass<br>
whose length is from 2 to 50 mm) or continuous-filament<br>
fibers (rovings) can be used for reinforcement.<br>
The glass fibers preferably used here have non-circular<br>
cross section and have a main cross-sectional axis:<br>
secondary cross-sectional axis dimensional ratio of<br>
more than 2, preferably from 2 to 8, in particular from<br>
2 to 5. These glass fibers are known as flat glass<br>
fibers and have an oval or elliptical cross section, or<br>
elliptical cross section with narrowed portion(s)<br>
(these being known as cocoon fibers), or have a<br>
polygonal, rectangular, or almost rectangular cross<br>
section. The glass fibers themselves here can have been<br>
selected from the group of E glass fibers, A glass<br>
fibers, C glass fibers, D glass fibers, M glass fibers,<br>
S glass fibers, and/or R glass fibers, preference being<br>
given here to E glass fibers. The glass fibers per se<br>
can also have been provided with an aminosilane coating<br>
or an epoxysilane coating, and this therefore applies<br>
to flat and also to round or angular fibers whose main<br>
cross-sectional axis: secondary cross-sectional axis<br>
dimensional ratio is less than 2.<br><br><br>
The inventive flat glass fibers with non-circular cross<br>
section are preferably used in the form of short glass<br>
fibers (chopped glass whose length is from 0.2 to<br>
20 mm, preferably from 2 to 12 mm) .<br>
A further characterizing feature of the flat glass<br>
fibers used is that the length of the main cross-<br>
sectional axis is preferably in the range from 6 to<br>
40 µm, in particular in the range from 15 to 30 µm, and<br>
the length of the secondary cross-sectional axis is in<br>
the range from 3 to 20 µm, in particular in the range<br>
from 4 to 10 µm.<br>
Mixtures of glass fibers with circular and non-circular<br>
cross section can also be used for reinforcement of the<br>
inventive molding compositions, and the proportion of<br>
flat glass fibers as defined above here is preferably<br>
predominant, i.e. amounts to more than 50% by weight of<br>
the total weight of the fibers. Combinations of the<br>
glass fibers (glass fibers whose cross section is<br>
circular and/or non-circular) with carbon fibers and/or<br>
with synthetic fibers, e.g. aramid fibers, and/or<br>
basalt fibers, can also be used as reinforcement.<br>
If reinforced molding compositions with good<br>
flowability and good surface quality are desired, in<br>
particular in combination with flame retardants, the<br>
reinforcing fibers are then preferably mainly (i.e. by<br>
way of example to an extent of more than 80% by weight<br>
or indeed more than 90% by weight) composed of flat<br>
glass fibers or indeed exclusively composed of flat<br>
glass fibers.<br>
The diameter of the glass fibers used according to the<br>
invention as rovings (filler component B) is from 10 to<br>
20 µm, preferably from 12 to 18 µm, where the cross<br>
section of the glass fibers can be round, oval,<br><br><br>
elliptical, elliptical with narrowed portion (s),<br>
polygonal, rectangular, or almost rectangular.<br>
Particular preference is given to fibers known as flat<br>
glass fibers whose ratio of cross-sectional axes is<br>
from 2 to 5. E glass fibers are particularly used<br>
according to the invention. However, it is also<br>
possible to use any of the other types of glass fiber,<br>
e.g. A, C, D, M, S, or R glass fibers, or any desired<br>
mixture thereof, or a mixture with E glass fibers.<br>
In the case of long-fiber-reinforced molding<br>
compositions, higher toughness values, and properties<br>
even more similar to those of metals, are obtained if,<br>
instead of the usual continuous-filament glass fibers<br>
whose diameter is from 15 to 19 µm, these fibers are<br>
used with diameter of from 10 to 14 µm, in particular<br>
with diameter of from 10 to 12 µm.<br>
The inventive polyamide molding compositions can be<br>
prepared via the known processes for the production of<br>
long-fiber-reinforced elongate pelletized material, in<br>
particular via pultrusion processes, in which the<br>
continuous-filament fiber strand (roving) is completely<br>
saturated with the polymer melt and then cooled and<br>
chopped.<br>
The long-fiber-reinforced elongate pelletized material<br>
thus obtained, the pellet length of which is preferably<br>
from 3 to 25 mm, in particular from 4 to 12 mm, can be<br>
further processed using the usual processing methods<br>
(e.g. injection molding, compression molding) to give<br>
moldings, and particularly good properties of the<br>
molding are achieved here, using non-aggressive<br>
processing methods. Non-aggressive in this context<br>
means especially substantial avoidance of excessive<br>
fiber breakage and of the attendant marked reduction of<br>
fiber length. In the case of injection molding, this<br>
means that it is preferable to use screws with large<br><br><br>
diameter and low compression ratio, in particular<br>
smaller than 2, and generously dimensioned nozzle<br>
channels and feed channels. A complementary factor to<br>
which attention should be paid is that high cylinder<br>
temperatures rapidly melt the elongate pelletized<br>
material (contact heating) and that the fibers are not<br>
excessively comminuted through excessive exposure to<br>
shear. According to the invention when these measures<br>
are taken into account, moldings are obtained whose<br>
average fiber length is higher than that of comparable<br>
moldings produced from short-fiber-reinforced molding<br>
compositions. The result of this is an additional<br>
improvement in properties, in particular in the case of<br>
tensile modulus of elasticity, ultimate tensile<br>
strength, and notched impact resistance.<br>
The diameter of the continuous-filament carbon fibers<br>
used during the pultrusion process is from 5 to 10 (am,<br>
preferably from 6 to 8 µm. The continuous-filament<br>
carbon fibers can be used alone or in combination with<br>
continuous-filament glass fibers (circular and/or non-<br>
circular cross section).<br>
To accelerate fiber impregnation, the fibers can be<br>
pre-heated to temperatures up to 400°C with the aid of<br>
a suitable IR, contact, radiative, or hot-gas pre-<br>
heating system. Apparatuses using spreader surfaces<br>
within the impregnation chamber provide complete<br>
impregnation of the fibers with the polymer melt.<br>
Strands emerging from the impregnation unit can be<br>
molded via controlled roll systems, thus giving<br>
pelletized material with circular, elliptical, or<br>
rectangular cross section.<br>
To improve binding to the matrix and to improve fiber<br>
handling, the fibers may have been coated with sizes of<br>
different chemical nature, these being known in the<br>
prior art for glass fibers and for carbon fibers.<br><br><br>
The thermoplastic molding compositions can preferably<br>
comprise, as further component, a particulate filler,<br>
or a mixture composed of two or more different fillers,<br>
also in combination with reinforcing materials. By way<br>
of example, it is possible to use mineral particulate<br>
fillers based on talc, on mica, on silicate, on quartz,<br>
on titanium dioxide, on wollastonite, on kaolin, on<br>
amorphous silicas, on magnesium carbonate, on magnesium<br>
hydroxide, on chalk, on lime, on feldspar, on barium<br>
sulfate, on solid glass beads, on hollow glass beads,<br>
or on ground glass, or to use permanently magnetic or<br>
respectively magnetizable metal compounds, and/or<br>
alloys. The fillers can also have been surface-treated.<br>
The molding compositions can comprise stabilizers,<br>
processing aids, and impact modifiers, and further<br>
additives.<br>
In another embodiment, the inventive molding<br>
composition comprises up to 45% by weight of one or<br>
more impact modifiers (IM) . An IM concentration in the<br>
range from 5 to 30% by weight is preferred.<br>
The impact modifier, which can be used as a constituent<br>
of component C, can be a natural rubber, polybutadiene,<br>
polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, a copolymer of butadiene<br>
and/or isoprene with styrene or with styrene<br>
derivatives and with other comonomers, a hydrogenated<br>
copolymer, and/or a copolymer produced via grafting or<br>
copolymerization with anhydrides, (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
or an ester thereof. The impact modifier (C) can also<br>
be a graft rubber with a crosslinked elastomeric core<br>
which is composed of butadiene, of isoprene, or of<br>
alkyl acrylates, and which has a graft shell composed<br>
of polystyrene, or can be a non-polar or polar olefin<br>
homo- or copolymer, such as ethylene-propylene rubber,<br>
ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, or ethylene-octene<br><br><br>
rubber, or ethylene-vinyl acetate rubber, or a non-<br>
polar or polar olefin homo- or copolymer produced via<br>
grafting or copolymerization with anhydrides, (meth)<br>
acrylic acid, or an ester thereof. The impact modifier<br>
(C) can also be a carboxylic-acid-functionalized<br>
copolymer, such as poly(ethene-co-(meth)acrylic acid)<br>
or poly(ethene-co-1-olefin-co-(meth)acrylic acid),<br>
where the 1-olefin is an alkene or an unsaturated<br>
(meth)acrylic ester having more than 4 atoms, inclusive<br>
of those copolymers in which the acid groups have been<br>
neutralized to some extent with metal ions.<br>
Preferred IMs based on styrene monomers (styrene and<br>
styrene derivatives) and on other vinylaromatic<br>
monomers are block copolymers composed of<br>
alkenylaromatic compounds and of a conjugated diene,<br>
and hydrogenated block copolymers composed of an<br>
alkenylaromatic compound and of conjugated dienes, and<br>
combinations of these types of IM. The block copolymer<br>
contains at least one block derived from an<br>
alkenylaromatic compound (A) and at least one block<br>
derived from a conjugated diene (B). In the case of the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymers, the proportion of<br>
aliphatically unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds<br>
has been reduced via hydrogenation. Suitable block<br>
copolymers are two-, three-, four-, and polyblock<br>
copolymers with linear structure. However, branched and<br>
star-shaped structures can likewise be used according<br>
to the invention. Branched block copolymers are<br>
obtained in a known manner, e.g. via graft reactions of<br>
polymeric "side branches" onto a main polymer chain.<br>
Other alkenylaromatic monomers that can be used<br>
alongside styrene or in a mixture with styrene are<br>
vinylaromatic monomers having substitution on the<br>
aromatic ring and/or on the C=C double bond by C1-20-<br>
hydrocarbon radicals or by halogen atoms.<br><br><br>
Examples of alkenylaromatic monomers are styrene, p-<br>
methylstyrene, a-methylstyrene, ethylstyrene, tert-<br>
butylstyrene, vinyltoluene, 1,2-diphenylethylene, 1,1-<br>
diphenylethylene, vinylxylenes, vinyltoluenes,<br>
vinylnaphthalenes, divinylbenzenes, bromostyrenes, and<br>
chlorostyrenes, and combinations thereof. Preference is<br>
given to styrene, p-methylstyrene, alpha-methylstyrene,<br>
and vinylnaphthalene.<br>
It is preferable to use styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-<br>
methylstyrene, ethylstyrene, tert-butylstyrene,<br>
vinyltoluene, 1,2-diphenylethylene, 1,1-<br>
diphenylethylene, or a mixture of these. It is<br>
particularly preferable to use styrene. However, it is<br>
also possible to use alkenylnaphthalenes.<br>
Examples of diene monomers that can be used are 1,3-<br>
butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-<br>
butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, isoprene,<br>
chloroprene, and piperylene. Preference is given to<br>
1,3-butadiene and isoprene, particularly 1,3-butadiene<br>
(hereinafter referred to by the abbreviated term<br>
butadiene).<br>
The alkenylaromatic monomer used preferably comprises<br>
styrene,. and the diene monomer used preferably<br>
comprises butadiene, and this means that preference is<br>
given to styrene-butadiene block copolymer. The block<br>
copolymers are generally prepared via anionic<br>
polymerization in a manner known per se.<br>
Other further comonomers can also be used<br>
concomitantly, in addition to the styrene monomers and<br>
diene monomers. The proportion of the comonomers is<br>
preferably from 0 to 50% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 0 to 30% by weight, and in particular<br>
from 0 to 15% by weight, based on the total amount of<br>
the monomers used. Examples of suitable comonomers are<br><br><br>
acrylates, in particular C1-12-alkyl acrylates, such as<br>
n-butyl acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, and the<br>
corresponding methacrylates, in particular Cl-12-alkyl<br>
methacrylates, such as methyl methacrylate (MMA). Other<br>
possible comonomers are (meth)acrylonitrile, glycidyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, vinyl methyl ether, diallyl and divinyl<br>
ethers of dihydric alcohols, divinylbenzene, and vinyl<br>
acetate.<br>
In addition to the conjugated diene, the hydrogenated<br>
block copolymers also contain, if appropriate,<br>
fractions of lower hydrocarbons, e.g. ethylene,<br>
propylene, 1-butene, dicyclopentadiene, or non-<br>
conjugated dienes. The proportion of the non-reduced<br>
aliphatic unsaturated bonds which result from the block<br>
B is smaller than 50% in the hydrogenated block<br>
copolymers, preferably smaller than 25%, in particular<br>
smaller than 10%. The aromatic fractions derived from<br>
block A are reduced to an extent of at most 25%. The<br>
hydrogenated block copolymers, styrene-(ethylene-<br>
butylene) two-block and styrene-(ethylene-butylene)-<br>
styrene three-block copolymers are obtained via<br>
hydrogenation of styrene-butadiene copolymers and of<br>
styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymers.<br>
The block copolymers are preferably composed of from 20<br>
to 90% by weight of block A, in particular from 50 to<br>
85% by weight of block A. The diene can be incorporated<br>
in 1,2-orientation or in 1,4-orientation into the block<br>
B.<br>
The molar mass of the block copolymers is from 5000 to<br>
500 000 g/mol, preferably from 20 000 to 300 000 g/mol,<br>
in particular from 40 000 to 200 000 g/mol.<br>
Suitable hydrogenated block copolymers are the<br>
commercially available products, such as KRATON®<br>
(Kraton Polymers) G1650, G1651 and G1652, and TUFTEC®<br><br><br>
(Asahi Chemicals) H1041, H1043, H1052, H1062, H1141,<br>
and H1272.<br>
Examples of non-hydrogenated block copolymers are<br>
polystyrene-polybutadiene, polystyrene-poly(ethylene-<br>
propylene) , polystyrene-polyisoprene, poly(a-<br>
methylstyrene)-polybutadiene,	polystyrene-<br>
polybutadiene-polystyrene (SBS), polystyrene-poly<br>
(ethylene-propylene)-polystyrene,	polystyrene-<br>
polyisoprene-polystyrene, and poly(α-methylstyrene)-<br>
polybutadiene-poly(α-methylstyrene), and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable non-hydrogenated block copolymers which are<br>
commercially available are various products with the<br>
trademarks SOLPRENE® (Phillips), KRATON® (Shell),<br>
VECTOR® (Dexco), and SEPTON® (Kuraray).<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the<br>
inventive molding compositions are those wherein<br>
component C comprises a polyolefin homopolymer or an<br>
ethylene-a-olefin copolymer, particularly preferably an<br>
EP elastomer and/or EPDM elastomer (ethylene-propylene<br>
rubber and respectively ethylene-propylene-diene<br>
rubber). By way of example, an elastomer can be<br>
involved which is based on an ethylene-C3-12-a-olefin<br>
copolymer with from 20 to 96% by weight, preferably<br>
from 25 to 85% by weight, of ethylene, where it is<br>
particularly preferable here that the C3-12-α-olefin<br>
involves an olefin selected from the group of propene,<br>
1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene,<br>
and/or 1-dodecene, and it is particularly preferable<br>
that component C involves ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
and/or LLDPE, and/or VLDPE.<br>
Alternatively or additionally (by way of example in a<br>
mixture), C can comprise a terpolymer based on<br>
ethylene-C3-12-α-olefin with an unconjugated diene, and<br><br><br>
it is preferable here that this contains from 25 to 85%<br>
by weight of ethylene and up to at most amounts in the<br>
region of 10% by weight of an unconjugated diene, and<br>
it is particularly preferable here that the C3-12-CC-<br>
olefin involves an olefin selected from the group of<br>
propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-<br>
decene, and/or 1-dodecene, and/or where the<br>
unconjugated diene has preferably been selected from<br>
the group of bicyclo[ 2 . 2 .1] heptadiene, 1,4-hexadiene,<br>
dicyclopentadiene, and/or in particular 5-<br>
ethylidenenorbornene.<br>
Ethylene-acrylate copolymers can also be used as<br>
constituent for component C.<br>
Other possible forms of constituents for component C<br>
are the ethylene-butylene copolymers and respectively<br>
mixtures (blends) which comprise these systems.<br>
It is preferable that component C comprises<br>
constituents having anhydride groups, these being<br>
introduced via thermal or free-radical reaction of the<br>
main-chain polymer with an unsaturated dicarboxylic<br>
anhydride, with an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, or<br>
with a monoalkyl ester of an unsaturated dicarboxylic<br>
acid, at a concentration sufficient for good binding to<br>
the polyamide, and it is preferable here to use<br>
reagents selected from the following group:<br>
maleic acid, maleic anhydride, monobutyl maleate,<br>
fumaric acid, aconitic acid, and/or itaconic anhydride.<br>
It is preferable that from 0.1 to 4.0% by weight of an<br>
unsaturated anhydride are grafted onto the impact-<br>
resistant component as a constituent of C, or that the<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride or its precursor is<br>
applied by grafting together with another unsaturated<br>
monomer. It is generally preferable that the degree of<br>
grafting is in the range from 0.1 to 1.0%, particularly<br><br><br>
preferably in the range from 0.3 to 0.7%. Another<br>
possible constituent of component C is a mixture<br>
composed of an ethylene-propylene copolymer and of an<br>
ethylene-butylene copolymer, the degree of maleic<br>
anhydride grafting (degree of MA grafting) here being<br>
in the range from 0.3 to 0.7%.<br>
The possible systems cited above for this component can<br>
also be used in mixtures.<br>
Component C can moreover comprise components which have<br>
functional groups, e.g. carboxylic acid groups, ester<br>
groups, epoxy groups, oxazoline groups, carbodiimide<br>
groups, isocyanate groups, silanol groups, and<br>
carboxylate groups, or can comprise a combination of<br>
two or more of the functional groups mentioned.<br>
Monomers which bear said functional groups can be<br>
bonded via copolymerization or grafting to the<br>
elastomeric polyolefin.<br>
The IMs based on the olefin polymers can moreover also<br>
have been modified via grafting with an unsaturated<br>
silane compound, e.g. vinyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriacetosilane, meth-<br>
acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, or propenyltrimethoxy-<br>
silane.<br>
The elastomeric polyolefins are random, alternating, or<br>
segmented copolymers having linear, branched, or core-<br>
shell structure, and contain functional groups which<br>
can react with the end groups of the polyamides, thus<br>
giving adequate compatibility between polyamide and IM.<br>
The inventive IMs therefore include homopolymers or<br>
copolymers of olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene, 1-<br>
butene, or copolymers of olefins and of copolymerizable<br>
monomers, such as vinyl acetate, (meth)acrylic ester,<br>
and methylhexadiene.<br><br><br>
Examples of crystalline olefin polymers are low-,<br>
medium-, and high-density polyethylenes, polypropylene,<br>
polybutadiene, poly-4-methylpentene, ethylene-propylene<br>
block copolymers or ethylene-propylene random<br>
copolymers, ethylene-methylhexadiene copolymers,<br>
propylene-methylhexadiene copolymers, ethylene-<br>
propylene-butene copolymers, ethylene-propylene-hexene<br>
copolymers,	ethylene-propylene-methylhexadiene<br>
copolymers, poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) (EVA), poly<br>
(ethylene-ethyl acrylate) (EEA), ethylene-octene<br>
copolymer, ethylene-butene copolymer, ethylene-hexene<br>
copolymer, ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers, and<br>
combinations of the polymers mentioned.<br>
Examples of commercially available impact modifiers<br>
which can be used for the purposes of the constituents<br>
of component C are:<br>

Preference is also given to an ionomer in which the<br>
polymer-bonded carboxy groups have been bonded to one<br>
another entirely or to some extent via metal ions.<br>
Particular preference is given to maleic-anhydride-<br>
grafting-functionalized copolymers of butadiene with<br>
styrene, to non-polar or polar olefin homo- and<br>
copolymers produced via grafting with maleic anhydride,<br>
and to carboxylic-acid-functionalized copolymers, such<br>
as poly(ethene-co-(meth)acrylic acid) or poly(ethene-<br>
co-1-olefin-co-(meth)acrylic acid), in which the acid<br>
groups have to some extent been neutralized with metal<br>
ions.<br>
The inventive PA10T/6T polyamides can be mixed with<br>
polyphenylene ethers (PPE). The polyphenylene ethers<br>
are known per se. They are prepared (cf. US patents<br>
3661848, 3378505, 3306874, 3306875 and 3639656) by<br>
conventional processes via oxidative coupling, from<br>
phenols disubstituted by alkyl groups in the ortho<br>
position. The preparation process usually uses catalyst<br>
based on heavy metals, such as copper, manganese, or<br>
cobalt, in combination with other substances, such as<br>
secondary amines, tertiary amines, halogens, or a<br>
combination thereof. Mixtures of polyamides with<br>
polyphenylene ethers are also known per se, but not<br>
with the copolyamide component proposed. By way of<br>
example WO-A-2005/0170039, WO-A-2005/0170040,<br>
WO-A-2005/0170041, and WO-A-2005/0170042 disclose<br>
mixtures composed of polyamide and PPE.<br>
Suitable polyphenylene ethers are poly(2,6-diethyl-1,4-<br>
phenylene) ether, poly(2-methyl-6-ethyl-1,4-phenylene)<br>
ether, poly (2-methyl-6-propyl-1,4-phenylene) ether,<br>
poly(2,6-dipropyl-1,4-phenylene) ether, poly(2-ethyl-6-<br>
propyl-1,4-phenylene) ether, or copolymers such as<br>
those which contain 2,3,6-trimethylphenol, and also<br><br><br>
polymer mixtures. Preference is given to poly(2,6-<br>
dimethyl-1,4-phenylene) ether optionally in combination<br>
with 2,3,6-trimethylphenol units. The polyphenylene<br>
ethers can be used in the form of homopolymers,<br>
copolymer, graft copolymers, block copolymer, or<br>
ionomers.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of suitable polyphenylene<br>
ethers is generally in the range from 0.1 to 0.6 dl/g,<br>
measured in CHCl3 at 25°C. This corresponds to a<br>
molecular weight Mn (number average) of from 3000 to<br>
40 000 and to a weight-average molecular weight value<br>
Mw of from 5000 to 80 000. It is possible to use a<br>
combination of a high-viscosity polyphenylene ether and<br>
a low-viscosity polyphenylene ether. The ratio of the<br>
two polyphenylene ethers of different viscosity depends<br>
on the viscosities and on the physical properties<br>
desired.<br>
The blends of the inventive PA10T/6T can comprise from<br>
10 to 45% by weight of polyphenylene ether and<br>
optionally up to 30% by weight, preferably up to 15% by<br>
weight, of impact modifier. For better compatibility,<br>
compatibilizers are used in the form of polyfunctional<br>
compounds which interact with the polyphenylene ether,<br>
the polyamide, or both. The interaction can be chemical<br>
(e.g. via grafting) and/or physical (e.g. via influence<br>
on the surface properties of the disperse phase).<br>
The compatibilizers can be polyfunctional compounds<br>
which contain at least one carboxylic acid group,<br>
carboxylic anhydride group, ester group, amide group,<br>
or imide group. Mention may be made by way of example<br>
of maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylic acid, methylmaleic acid, methylmaleic<br>
anhydride, itaconic acid, itaconic anhydride,<br>
butenylsuccinic acid, butenylsuccinic anhydride,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride,<br><br><br>
N-phenylmaleimide, citric acid, malic acid, and 2-<br>
hydroxynonadecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, the mono-<br>
or diesters of the acids mentioned with C1-C12<br>
alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, the mono- or<br>
diamides of the acids mentioned which, if appropriate,<br>
can have substitution on the nitrogen by alkyl or aryl<br>
radicals having up to 12 carbon atoms, and the salts<br>
with alkali metals or with alkaline earth metals, e.g.<br>
calcium and potassium. Particularly advantageous<br>
compounds are maleic acid, fumaric acid, maleic<br>
anhydride, and citric acid. An amount of from 0.05 to<br>
2% by weight of the compatibilizers can be added<br>
directly during blend preparation, or the polyphenylene<br>
ether and/or the polyamide is functionalized in a<br>
separate step via the compatibilizers.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of the<br>
inventive molding compositions for the production of<br>
thermoplastically processable molded items, and also<br>
the molded items obtainable from the inventive<br>
compositions.<br>
Examples of these molded items include: casings and<br>
functional parts for pumps, gearboxes, valves and water<br>
meters, throttle valves, cylinders, pistons, headlamp<br>
casings, reflectors, bend-adaptive lighting,<br>
gearwheels, engine mountings and gearbox mountings,<br>
connectors, including plug connectors, profiles, foils,<br>
or layers of multilayer foils; they also include<br>
fibers, electronic components, casings for electronic<br>
components, tools, composite materials, fluid-<br>
conducting lines and containers, in particular in the<br>
automobile sector, smooth and corrugated mono- or<br>
multilayer tubes, tube sections, spigots, fittings for<br>
the connection of hoses, of corrugated tubes, and of<br>
lines conducting fluids, a constituent of multilayer<br>
lines (inner, outer, or intermediate layer), individual<br>
layers in multilayer containers, hydraulic lines, brake<br><br><br>
lines, clutch lines, coolant lines, brake-fluid<br>
containers, etc.<br>
The molded items can be produced by the processes of<br>
injection molding, extrusion, or blow molding.<br>
The present invention further provides a powder based<br>
on the PA10T/6T copolyamides, a layer-by-layer process<br>
in which regions of the respective pulverulent layer<br>
are melted selectively, and are hardened after cooling,<br>
and also moldings produced from said powder.<br>
It is preferable here to use powders whose average<br>
grain size is from 30 to 200 µm, in particular from 50<br>
to 150 µm, an example being those obtained via grinding<br>
processes and precipitation processes. Preferred<br>
processes here are particularly those which lead to<br>
particles whose shape is as close as possible to<br>
spherical, since these exhibit advantages during<br>
application of powder in layers in the selective laser<br>
sintering process (SLS process).<br>
It is preferable to use unregulated or regulated<br>
copolyamide powders whose solution viscosity (0.5% by<br>
weight in m-cresol at 20°C) is in the range from 1.3 to<br>
2.0, in particular in the range from 1.35 to 1.85.<br>
Mono- and/or dicarboxylic acids, or mono- and/or<br>
diamines, are used for regulation. The ratio of carboxy<br>
to amino end groups in the regulated copolyamide<br>
powders is preferably greater than or equal to 1:2 and,<br>
respectively, 2:1, in particular greater than or equal<br>
to 1:3 and, respectively, 3:1, where the concentration<br>
of the predominant carboxy or amino end groups is at<br>
least 50 mmol/kg, in particular at least 100 mmol/kg.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the sintering powder is a<br>
mixture of oppositely difunctionally regulated<br>
PA10T/6T. This means that the powders are composed of a<br><br><br>
combination of separately amine-regulated and carboxy-<br>
regulated powder particles. This mixed copolyamide<br>
powder retains its solution viscosity at an almost<br>
constant level on exposure to thermal stress below the<br>
melting point, for example the stress occurring during<br>
the SLS process for the non-sintered powder, and said<br>
mixed powder can therefore be used repeatedly in the<br>
rapid prototyping/rapid manufacturing process with only<br>
small amounts of virgin powder or indeed without<br>
addition of virgin powder. Disposal of powder residue<br>
often becomes unnecessary by virtue of these excellent<br>
recycling qualities.<br>
One process which has particularly good suitability for<br>
the purposes of rapid prototyping or rapid<br>
manufacturing is laser sintering. In this process,<br>
plastics powders are selectively and briefly irradiated<br>
with a laser beam in a chamber, thus melting the powder<br>
particles impacted by the laser beam. The molten<br>
particles coalesce and, after cooling, solidify again<br>
to give a solid mass. This process can produce complex<br>
three-dimensional bodies simply and rapidly, via<br>
repeated irradiation of a succession of newly applied<br>
layers. However, there are a number of other suitable<br>
processes, as well as laser sintering. The selectivity<br>
of the layer-by-layer processes here can be achieved by<br>
way of application of susceptors, absorber, inhibitors,<br>
or masks, or by way of focused introduction of energy,<br>
for example via a laser beam or via a glass fiber<br>
cable.<br>
Polyamide-12 powder has proven particularly successful<br>
in industry for laser sintering for the production of<br>
components. Although the parts manufactured from PA12<br>
powder are often adequate for mechanical stresses and<br>
their properties are therefore close to those of the<br>
subsequent mass-produced injection-molded or extruded<br>
parts, PA12 has a low melting point of 178 °C and low<br><br><br>
stiffness of about 1300 MPa, which is inadequate for<br>
many applications. These disadvantages can be overcome<br>
via the inventive copolyamide powders based on PA10T/6T<br>
whose melting point is in the range from 270 to 320°C<br>
and whose tensile modulus of elasticity is above<br>
2500 MPa.<br>
The sintering powder can comprise at least one further<br>
filler, as well as the 10T/6T copolyamide particles.<br>
These fillers can by way of example be glass particles<br>
or metal particles, or ceramic particles, or else the<br>
abovementioned particulate fillers. In particular, the<br>
sintering powder can comprise solid or hollow glass<br>
beads, steel shot, or granular metal as fillers. Glass<br>
beads whose average diameter is from 20 to 80 µm are<br>
typically used. In one preferred embodiment, these<br>
fillers have been coated with a thin layer of the<br>
inventive copolyamide, the layer thickness here<br>
preferably being from 2 to 30 µm, in particular from 5<br>
to 20 µm. The average particle size of the filler<br>
particles here is preferably smaller than or<br>
approximately equal to that of the particles of the<br>
polyamides. The amount by which the average particle<br>
size of the fillers exceeds the average particle size<br>
of the polyamides should preferably be not more than<br>
30%, preferably not more than 20%, and very<br>
particularly preferably not more than 10%. There is a<br>
particular limitation on particle size via the<br>
permissible layer thickness in the respective laser<br>
sintering apparatus.<br>
The inventive copolyamide molding compositions can also<br>
be spun to give fibers which are resistant to<br>
temperature change and which have high strength and low<br>
water absorption. Together with other polymers, it is<br>
possible to produce the fibers known as bicomponent<br>
fibers, of side-by-side type and of core-shell type.<br><br>

METHODS OF WORKING THE INVENTION<br>
Production of the products/preparation processes:<br>
The semiaromatic PA 10T/6T copolyamides (A) can be prepared by<br>
processes known per se. Suitable processes have been described<br>
in various publications, and some of the possible processes<br>
discussed in the patent literature will be cited below, and<br>
the disclosure of the documents discussed hereinafter is<br>
expressly incorporated by way of reference into the disclosure<br>
of this document with regard to the process for the<br>
preparation of the copolyamide of component (A) of the present<br>
invention:<br>
DE 195 13 940 describes a process which encompasses the<br>
following stages, and this process can be used for the<br>
preparation of component (A):<br>
a)	a salt-formation stage for the formation of salts<br>
composed of diamine(s) and dicarboxylic acid(s) in an<br>
aqueous solution of strength from 5 to 50% by weight<br>
comprising the components, and, if appropriate, partial<br>
prereaction to give low-molecular-weight oligoamides at<br>
temperatures of from 120°C to 220°C and under pressures<br>
of up to 23 bar,<br>
b)	if appropriate, transfer of the solution from stage a)<br>
into a second reaction vessel or into a stirred<br>
autoclave, under the conditions prevailing at the end of<br>
its preparation process,<br><br>
c)	conduct of the reaction phase during which the<br>
reaction takes place to give the precondensates,<br>
with heating of the reactor contents to a<br>
prescribed temperature and controlled adjustment<br>
of the partial water vapor pressure to the<br>
prescribed value, which is maintained via<br>
controlled discharge of water vapor or, if<br>
appropriate, controlled infeed of water vapor from<br>
a steam generator associated with the autoclave,<br>
d)	a stationary-state phase to be maintained for at<br>
least 10 minutes, in which the temperature of the<br>
reactor contents and the partial water vapor<br>
pressure are respectively adjusted in a controlled<br>
manner - using the measures listed under c) in the<br>
case of the partial water vapor pressure - to the<br>
values intended for the transfer of the<br>
precondensates to the following stage of the<br>
process,<br>
the above with the proviso that in the case of<br>
precondensates of semicrystalline polyamides or<br>
copolyamides whose melting point is more than 28 0°<br>
C (melting point maximum measured by means of<br>
differential scanning calorimetry) the temperature<br>
of the reactor contents during this phase d) and<br>
phase c) is not permitted to exceed 265°C, and<br>
that, for said semicrystalline polyamides or<br>
copolyamides, during phases d) and c) , the<br>
boundary conditions described are to be maintained<br>
with respect to the dependency of the minimum<br>
partial water vapor pressure to be used on the<br>
temperature of the reactor contents and on the<br>
amide group concentration of the polymer,<br>
e)	a discharge phase, during which the precondensates<br>
can be introduced into a final reaction apparatus,<br><br>
while the temperature prevailing at the end of<br>
phase d) is kept constant, and the partial water<br>
vapor pressure prevailing at said juncture is at<br>
least maintained, via infeed of water vapor from<br>
said steam generator into the autoclave, and all<br>
discharge lines/assemblies associated therewith,<br>
either in the molten state by way of a buffer<br>
device directly or by way of a separator apparatus<br>
and passage through the solid state, with<br>
subsequent optional drying and/or comminution and,<br>
if appropriate, further stages of the process.<br>
EP 0 976 774 describes a process for the preparation of<br>
polyamides which encompasses the following steps in the<br>
stated sequence and which likewise can be used for the<br>
preparation of the copolyamide of component (A), if the<br>
corresponding constituents are replaced according to<br>
the invention:<br>
(i) a step in which a dicarboxylic acid component<br>
with terephthalic acid content and a diamine<br>
component are polycondensed in the presence of<br>
from 15 to 35% by weight of water at a reaction<br>
temperature of from 250°C to 280°C and at a<br>
reaction pressure (P) which complies with the<br>
following formula P0 ≥ P ≥ 0.7 P0, where P0 is<br>
the saturated vapor pressure of water at the<br>
reaction temperature, in order to form a<br>
primary polycondensate;<br>
(ii) a step in which the resultant polycondensate<br>
formed as in the preceding step (i) is taken<br>
from the reactor into an atmospheric<br>
environment while its temperature is in the<br>
range from 250°C to 280°C and its water content<br>
is in the range from 15 to 35% by weight;<br>
(iii) a step in which the primary polycondensate thus<br><br><br>
taken from the preceding step (ii) is subjected<br>
to solid-phase polymerization or polymerization<br>
in the melt, in order to give a polyamide with<br>
an increased molecular weight.<br>
EP 0 129 195, EP 0 129 196, and EP 0 299 444 describe<br>
processes for the continuous preparation of polyamides<br>
which are also suitable in appropriately modified form<br>
for the production of component (A) , by first heating<br>
aqueous solutions of strength from 30 to 70% of salts<br>
composed of dicarboxylic acids and of diamines under<br>
elevated pressure of from 1 to 10 bar, with<br>
simultaneous evaporation of water, within a residence<br>
time of less than 60 seconds, to a temperature of from<br>
250 to 300°C, and then continuously separating<br>
prepolymers and vapors, rectifying the vapors, and<br>
returning the entrained diamines. Finally, the<br>
prepolymer is passed to a polycondensation zone and<br>
polycondensed at a gage pressure of from 1 to 10 bar<br>
and at a temperature of from 250 to 300°C. On exit from<br>
the evaporator zone, the degree of conversion is<br>
advantageously at least 93% and the water content of<br>
the prepolymer is at most 7% by weight. Formation of<br>
diamines is substantially avoided by these short<br>
residence times.<br>
US 4,831,108 describes a polycondensation process for<br>
the preparation of polyamides, polyamideimides,<br>
polyesters, and polyarylates, which likewise can be<br>
used in appropriately modified form for the preparation<br>
of component (A) , and which is characterized in that a<br>
heated solution of a salt or of a prepolymer, or of a<br>
mixture composed of a salt and of a prepolymer, is<br>
first formed, and practically is homogeneous, and forms<br>
a single phase, and is stable at the selected<br>
polycondensation temperature, and readily atomizes, and<br>
then this solution is fed, with formation of an<br>
aerosol, into a vaporization reactor, which is operated<br><br><br>
at a pressure of from about 0 to 2.76 MPa (from 0 to<br>
400 psig), for purposes of condensation and<br>
polymerization, where said vaporization reactor has<br>
been designed for high heat flux with wall temperatures<br>
of from about 204 to 538°C (from 400 to 1000°F) and<br>
melting points of from about 177 to 399°C (from 350 to<br>
750°F), and where the resultant polymer is kept in the<br>
reactor for from about 0.1 to about 20 seconds.<br>
US 4,607,073 reveals that semiaromatic polyamides can<br>
also be prepared from terephthaloyl chloride or<br>
dimethyl terephthalate with the corresponding diamines.<br>
Polyamide is prepared via precondensation of the dry<br>
salt at 310°C under nitrogen and at atmospheric<br>
pressure and then 12 hours of solid-phase<br>
postcondensation at 295°C. This type of process can<br>
also be used for preparation of component (A) after<br>
appropriate modification.<br>
According to DE 14 95 393 and US 3,454,536, it is<br>
preferable, when preparing the polyamides from the<br>
dicarboxylic esters, to begin by heating the starting<br>
components in the presence of water to from 90 °C to<br>
100°C, and to remove the resultant methanol practically<br>
completely by distillation, and then to polycondense<br>
the distillation residue either at superatmospheric<br>
pressure with subsequent depressurization or at<br>
atmospheric pressure throughout, at temperatures of<br>
from 250 to 290°C. This type of process can also be<br>
used for the preparation of component (A).<br>
The most familiar process for the preparation of<br>
polyamides with high melting points, and a suitable<br>
process for the preparation of component (A) , is the<br>
two-stage preparation first of a low-viscosity, low-<br>
molecular-weight precondensate, with subsequent post-<br>
condensation in the solid phase or in the melt (e.g. in<br>
an extruder). A three-stage process is also possible,<br><br><br>
composed of 1. precondensation, 2. solid-phase<br>
polymerization, and 3. polymerization in the melt, as<br>
cited in DE 696 30 260.<br>
For products with melting points below 300°C, another<br>
suitable process is the single-stage batch process<br>
described by way of example in US 3,843,611 and<br>
US 3,839,296, in which the mixture of the monomers or<br>
their salts is heated for from 1 to 16 hours to<br>
temperatures of from 250 to 320°C, and the pressure is<br>
reduced from a maximum to the lowest pressure of up to<br>
1 mmHg, with evaporation of gaseous material, if<br>
appropriate with the aid of an inert gas.<br>
Specific examples will be given below, and compared<br>
with comparative examples (C) and discussed. Storage in<br>

The precondensate from example PreC is postcondensed in<br>
a twin-screw extruder from Werner and Pfleiderer using<br>
a screw diameter of 25 mm with prescribed process<br>
parameters (barrel temperature, screw rotation rate,<br>
throughput) . The melt is devolatilized in zone 10 by a<br>
stream of nitrogen.<br>
The product is drawn off in the form of a strand from a<br><br>
die with diameter 3 mm and pelletized. The pellets are<br>
dried for 24 hours at 120°C in a vacuum of 30 mbar.<br>

As can be seen from the graph in Fig. 1 of the results<br>
cited above, ideal melting points are obtained for the<br>
inventively claimed ratios of 1,10-decanediamine and<br><br>
1,6-hexanediamine, a minimum being observed in the<br>
range from 60 to 70 mol% of 10T.<br>
As can be seen from the further graph provided in<br>
Fig. 2 of the results cited above, water absorption is<br>
always substantially greater for the systems in the<br>
comparative examples than for the polyamide molding<br>
compositions proposed in the invention. It can moreover<br>
be seen that a fall in water absorption can be observed<br>
for increasing 10T proportions. Both melting point and<br>
water absorption are parameters that have to be taken<br>
into account, and the result is therefore the<br>
inventively claimed ideal ranges.<br><br><br><br>
Comparative examples CE7 and CE8 show that although a<br>
combination of terephthalic acid with long-chain<br>
dicarboxylic acids can reduce water absorption, the<br>
modulus ratios and strength ratios are below those of<br>
the PA10T/6T copolyamides.<br>

Grivory HTV-5H1 is a 50%-glassfiber-reinforced PA6T/6I,<br><br><br><br>
compounded materials, processing by injection molding<br>
is very difficult, because material freezes in the<br>
injection-molding nozzle, because of the high<br>
crystallization rate. The surface quality of 10 x 10 cm<br>

preceding inventive examples from the corresponding<br>
precondensate.<br>
The compounded materials reinforced with flat glass<br>
fibers in particular have relatively high transverse<br>
stiffness and transverse strength, and also a<br>
relatively high HDT C value, in comparison with the<br>
conventionally reinforced compounded materials, i.e.<br>
those reinforced with glass fibers whose cross section<br>
is circular.<br>

The halogen-free flame-retardant molding compositions<br>
of inventive examples 19 to 21 are reliably V-0, with<br>

from 0.005 to 1.5% by weight of at least one<br>
polycondensation catalyst, where this preferably involves<br>
phosphorus compounds, such as phosphoric acid,<br>
phosphorous acid, hypophosphorous acid, phenylphosphonic<br>
acid, phenylphosphinic acid, and/or salts thereof with<br>
cations of valency from 1 to 3, e.g. Na, K, Mg, Ga, Zn,<br>
or Al, and/or their esters, such as triphenyl phosphate,<br>
triphenyl phosphite, or tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite, or a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
30.	The process as claimed in claim 29, wherein the<br>
polycondensation catalyst involves hypophosphorous acid<br>
and sodium hydrogen hypophosphite monohydrate in an<br>
amount of from 100 to 500 ppm of phosphorus, based on the<br>
semiaromatic 10T/6T copolyamide (A).<br>
31.	The process as claimed in either of claims 29 and 30,<br>
wherein, to compensate diamine loss, a diamine excess of<br>
from 1 to 8% by weight, based on the entirety of the<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A polyamide molding composition with the following<br>
constitution is described:<br>
(A)	from 30 to 100% by weight of at least one<br>
10T/6T copolyamide, where this is composed of<br>
(Al) from 40 to 95 mol% of 10T units, formed<br>
from the monomers 1,10-decanediamine and<br>
terephthalic acid<br>
(A2) from 5 to 60 mol% of 6T units, formed<br>
from the monomers 1,6-hexanediamine and<br>
terephthalic acid<br>
(B)	from 0 to 70% by weight of reinforcing<br>
materials and/or fillers<br>
(C)	from 0 to 50% by weight of additives and/or<br>
further polymers<br>
where the entirety of components A to C is 100%, with<br>
the proviso that in component (A) up to 30 mol%, based<br>
on the entirety of the dicarboxylic acids, of the<br>
terephthalic acid can have been replaced by other<br>
aromatic, aliphatic, or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic<br>
acids, and with the proviso that in component (A) up to<br>
30 mol% of 1,10-decanediamine and respectively 1,6-<br>
hexanediamine, based on the entirety of the diamines,<br>
can have been replaced by other diamines, and with the<br>
proviso that not more than 30 mol% in component (A) ,<br>
based on the entirety of the monomers, can have been<br>
formed via lactams or amino acids. Uses of this<br>
polyamide molding composition are moreover described,<br>
as also are processes for the preparation of these<br>
polyamide molding compositions.</td>
