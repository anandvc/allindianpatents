R"    is hydrogen, lower alkyl or C3-6-cycloalkyl;<br>
Y      is -CH= or =N-;<br>
R3 is a six-membered aromatic heteroqrde containing 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms or a pyridine-N-oxide, which rings are unsubstituted or substituted by one or two substituents sdected from the group consisting of<br>
halogen, fluoro-lower alkyl, fluoro-lower alkoxy, cyano&gt; amino, lower alkylamino, lower alkoxy-lower alkylamino, lower hydroxy-lower alkylamino, -(CH2)n-C(O)-0R", -(CH2)n-C(O)-NR'RÂ», -(CH2)n-S02-NR'R", - (CH2)n-C(NH2)=NR", hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, C3-6-cydoalkyl and lower alkyl, which is optionally substituted by fluoro, -NR'R", hydroxy, lower alkoxy, pyrrolidin-l-yl, azetidin-1-yl, cyano or carbamoyloxy, whereby R' and R" have the meaning specified above;<br>
n      is 0,1,2,3 or 4;<br>
and their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic add, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent<br><br>
stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controfled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the femily of G-protein-coupled<br>
receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different aflSnity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluRS belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluRS belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluRS belong to group m.<br>
ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group 11 can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia, Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, minary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production, as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compoimds advantages in absorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>
All tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are also embraced herewith.<br><br>

The compounds of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured according to a process, which comprises<br><br><br>
and, if desired,<br>
converting the compound obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable add addition salt<br>
In more detail, according to scheme A, compounds of general formula I, in which X,Y,R1R2 and R3 are as described above, can be prepared from compounds of general2 formula II via an acylation-deprotection-cydization sequence:<br><br><br>
Reacting compounds of general formula 11 with a dioxinone IV, in which Y and R are as described above, in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 Â°C and 160 Â°C, gives rise to compounds of general formula EI,<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula III can also be prepared by for example reaction of a compound of general formula 11 with a P-ketoester (general i    formula IVa), in which Y and R are as described above, using the same conditions as described for the reaction with the dioxinones.<br>
Afterwards, cleaving the BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group in compounds of general formula HI and concomitant cydization of the deprotected compound yidds the desired compounds of general formula L Any other suitable amino protecting group, such as e.g. Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) or ben2yloxycarbonyl (Z), can be alternatively used instead of the BOC group.<br>
The deprotection-cyclization step can be carried out by treating the compounds of general formula III with for example a Bronsted add such as trifluoroacetic add in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 0 Â°C and 50 Â°C. It may be advantageous to use also anisole or 1,3-dimethoxybenzene as a carbocation scavenger in the reaction mixture.<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula II, in which R1 R2 and X are as described above can be prepared according to scheme B, by reducing the nitro group in compounds of general formula Via to the amino group. The reduction can for example be carried out using hydrogen gas in presence of a suitable catalyst like for example Raney-Nickel or Pafladium on carbon. Another possible reduction method is using stannous(n)chloride (SnCl2*2H20) in ethanol at temperatures between 70 Â°C and 80 Â°C (as described in Tetrahedron Lett. 1984,25y 839), or alternatively in polar aprotic solvents, like DMF, DMA or NMP and the like, optionally in the presence of bases&gt; like for example pyridine or triethylamine and the like, at temperatures between 0 Â°C and 80 Â°C. Another suitable method is using zinc-powder in the presence of ammonium chloride in protic solvents like for example water or ethanol at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 80 Â°C.

Transection and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was subdoned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen (NV Leek, The Netherlands). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfacted with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration) and 10 % dialysed foetal calf serum from Gibco BRL (Basel, Switzerland). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (1000 ug/ml final). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5 Âµg total RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2 receptor specific primers 5'-atcactgcttgggtttctÂ°Cactg-3' and 5'-agcatcactgtgggggcataggagc-3' in 60 mM Tris HQ (pH 10), 15 mM (NH4)2S04,2 mM MgQ2,25 units/ml Taq Polymerase with 30 cydes annealing at 60 Â°C for 1 min., extention at 72 Â°C for 30 s, and 1 min. 95 Â°C denaturation.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above, were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and firozen at -80 Â°C, The pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and homogenised with a polytron (Kinematica, AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 10 s at 10 000 rpm. After centrifugation for 30 min. at 4 'Â°C, the pellet was washed once with the same buffer, and once with cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.4). Protein content was measured using the Pierce method (Socodiim, Lausanne, Switzerland) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[^H]-LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM CaCl2, (pH 7) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25Âµg protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-Ly354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 ÂµM DCGIV. After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland).<br><br>
