				<td>Description<br>
Rolling method for a rolled product for introducing a step<br>
into the rolled product<br>
The present invention relates to a rolling method for a rolled<br>
product, in particular a strip-type rolled product, which has<br>
a rolled product start and a rolled product end, the rolled<br>
product being rolled to a first desired dimension in a rolling<br>
gap of a rolling stand, starting with the start of the rolled<br>
product.<br>
The present invention also relates to a data medium with a<br>
computer program stored on the data medium for implementing<br>
such a rolling method, when the computer program is executed<br>
by a control computer for a rolling stand. The present<br>
invention also relates to a control computer for a rolling<br>
stand, which is configured - in particular programmed - in<br>
such a manner that the rolling stand can be activated by it<br>
according to such a rolling method. Finally the present<br>
invention relates to a rolled product, in particular a strip-<br>
type rolled product.<br>
Rolling methods, data media, control computers and rolled<br>
products of the type mentioned in the introduction are<br>
generally known. In particular with the rolling methods of the<br>
type mentioned in the introduction the entire rolled product<br>
is rolled to the first desired dimension, in other words from<br>
the rolled product start to the rolled product end.<br>
In some instances it would be expedient and useful to roll the<br>
rolled product to different desired dimensions, with the<br>
rolled product to be kept as a unit that is continuous per se.<br><br>
A solution to this problem is not known in the prior art to<br>
the knowledge of the applicant. It is known that the entire<br>
rolled product can first be rolled to a first desired<br>
dimension and the rolled product can then be divided, with one<br>
of the segments of the rolled product thus resulting being<br>
rolled to a second desired dimension. In this instance however<br>
the two segments of the rolled product are no longer<br>
continuous in respect of one another.<br>
The procedure described just above also has further<br>
disadvantages. In particular the process of dividing the<br>
rolled product into two segments is often time-consuming. This<br>
results in temperature losses, which in turn have a negative<br>
influence on subsequent rolling processes. The time; required<br>
to separate the individual segments means that this procedure<br>
can only be used to produce a rolled product, which has<br>
maximum two desired dimensions, and this only in segments that<br>
are separated from one another.<br>
The object of the present invention is to create a rolling<br>
method, a data medium and a control computer for a rolling<br>
stand, which can be used to produce a rolled product, which is<br>
configured as continuous per se and has at least two segments<br>
in the longitudinal direction, said segments having different<br>
dimensions from one another.<br>
The object is achieved for the rolling method in that while<br>
the rolled product is being rolled in the rolling stand, a<br>
control computer determines in an ongoing manner which point<br>
of the rolled product is currently in the rolling gap and<br>
rolling of the rolled product to the first desired dimension<br>
is terminated, when the point of the rolled product currently<br>
in the rolling gap corresponds to a previously determined<br><br>
first change point of the rolled product, which is located<br>
between the start of the rolled product and the end of the<br>
rolled product, so that a first step is introduced into the<br>
rolled product at the first change point.<br>
In a corresponding manner the object for the data medium is<br>
achieved in that it stores a computer program, which serves to<br>
implement such a rolling method, when the computer program is<br>
executed by a control computer for a rolling stand.<br>
Finally the object is achieved by a control computer for a<br>
rolling stand, which is configured, in particular programmed,<br>
in such a manner that the rolling stand can be activated by it<br>
according to such a rolling method.<br>
This basic form of the present invention can be realized<br>
regardless of the manner in which the rolling gap is set.<br>
In modern rolling stands the rolling gap is generally set by<br>
way of hydraulic cylinder units. Compared with other control<br>
elements such hydraulic cylinder units have the advantage that<br>
they can be adjusted not only in the load-free state but also<br>
under load. In particular if the rolling stand has such<br>
control elements that can be adjusted under load, it is<br>
possible for the rolled product to be rolled to a second<br>
desired dimension in the direction of the end of the rolled<br>
product after reaching the first change point.<br>
In this instance the second desired dimension can be smaller<br>
than the first desired dimension. Generally it will be greater<br>
than the first desired dimension.<br><br>
To complete the picture, it should be pointed out that to set<br>
the rolling gap under load the rolling speed generally has to<br>
be different from zero. The first step is therefore generally<br>
somewhat rounded. Alternatively it is also possible for the<br>
rollers of the rolling stand to be supported in roller<br>
bearings and the contact time at zero rolling speed to be kept<br>
so short that damage to the rollers - in particular burn<br>
damage - can be avoided.<br>
It is possible for the rolled product to be rolled to the<br>
second desired dimension from the first change point to the<br>
end of the rolled product. It is also possible for rolling of<br>
the rolled product to the second desired dimension to be<br>
terminated when the point of the rolled product currently in<br>
the rolling gap corresponds to a previously determined second<br>
change point, which is located between the first change point<br>
and the end of the rolled product, so that a second step is<br>
introduced into the rolled product at the second change point.<br>
As an alternative to rolling to the end of the rolled product,<br>
the rolled product can also be rolled to a second desired<br>
dimension in the direction of the start of the rolled product<br>
after reaching the first change point. Rolling to the second<br>
desired dimension can take place at the first change point or<br>
only from a point closer to the start of the rolled product.<br>
It is possible for rolling of the rolled product to the second<br>
desired dimension to be terminated, when the point of the<br>
rolled product currently in the rolling gap corresponds to a<br>
previously determined second change point, which is located<br>
between the start of the rolled product and the first change<br>
point, so that a second step is introduced into the rolled<br>
product at the second change point. The rolled product is<br><br>
generally rolled to the second desired dimension to the start<br>
of the rolled product.<br>
As an alternative to continuing rolling, it is also possible<br>
for the rolling stand to be raised, when the point of the<br>
rolled product currently in the rolling gap corresponds to the<br>
first change point, so that the rolled product passes through<br>
the rolling gap without being worked after the rolling stand<br>
has been raised. This procedure can then also be carried out,<br>
when the control elements for adjusting the rolling gap can<br>
only be adjusted in the load-free state.<br>
The rolled product can pass through the - then raised -<br>
rolling stand without being worked either forward (in other<br>
words in the previous rolling direction) or backward.<br>
When the rolled product passes through backward without being<br>
worked or has been rolled to the second desired dimension from<br>
the first change point to the start of the rolled product, it<br>
is possible for the rolled product, after rolling to the first<br>
and/or second desired dimension, starting with the start of<br>
the rolled product, to be rolled to a third desired dimension<br>
in the rolling gap of the rolling stand, until the point of<br>
the rolled product currently in the rolling gap corresponds to<br>
a second change point.<br>
The second change point can be located between the start of<br>
the rolled product and the first change point, so that a<br>
second step is introduced into the rolled product at the<br>
second change point. The second change point can also<br>
correspond to the first change point, so that the first step<br>
is increased.<br><br>
In contrast, when the rolled product has passed in its<br>
entirety through the rolling stand, it is possible for the<br>
rolled product then to be rolled to a second desired<br>
dimension, starting with the end of the rolled product, until<br>
the point currently in the rolling gap corresponds to a second<br>
change point, which is located between the first change point<br>
and the end of the rolled product, so that a second step is<br>
introduced into the rolled product at the second change point.<br>
Rolling to the second dimension is of course also terminated<br>
at the second change point in this instance.<br>
Further advantages and details will emerge from the<br>
description which follows of exemplary embodiments in<br>
conjunction with the basic outlines in the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1	shows the basic structure of a rolling<br>
arrangement,<br>
Figure 2	shows a flow diagram,<br>
Figures 3 to 14 show different states during the rolling<br>
of a rolled product and<br>
Figure 15	shows a rolled product after rolling.<br>
According to Figure 1 a rolled product 1 is to be rolled. The<br>
rolled product 1 here is preferably a strip-type rolled<br>
product 1. However a rod-type rolled product or a tubular<br>
rolled product could also be rolled.<br>
The rolled product 1 has a rolled product start 2 and a rolled<br>
product end 3. Also at least one change point 4 - also<br>
referred to below as the first change point 4 - is predefined.<br>
The change point 4 is preferably not defined by its distance<br>
from the rolled product start 2 or the rolled product end 3,<br><br>
since this distance changes as the rolled product 1 is rolled.<br>
Rather the change point 4 is preferably determined by the<br>
quantity of material of the rolled product 1 between the<br>
change point 4 and the rolled product start 2 or the rolled<br>
product end 3.<br>
The rolled product 1 is rolled in a rolling stand 5. For its<br>
part the rolling stand 5 is controlled by a control computer<br>
6. A computer program 7 is supplied to the control computer 6.<br>
The computer program 7 can be supplied for example by means of<br>
a portable or otherwise data medium 8, on which the computer<br>
program 7 is- stored in (exclusively) machine-readable form.<br>
Supplying the computer program 7 programs (or more generally<br>
configures) the control computer 6 in such a manner that it<br>
executes a rolling method, which is described below in<br>
conjunction with Figures 2 to 14.<br>
According to Figure 2 in a step S1 the control computer 6<br>
activates the rolling stand 5 in such a manner that the rolled<br>
product 1 is rolled to a first desired dimension dl* (in the<br>
case of a strip-type rolled product 1 therefore to a first<br>
desired thickness dl*) from the rolled product start 2.<br>
Determination of the necessary control parameters for the<br>
rolling stand 5 by means of a pass schedule and the stand<br>
parameters of the rolling stand 5 is generally know to those<br>
skilled in the art. The actual rolling process, in other words<br>
the working of the rolled product 1, takes place in a rolling<br>
gap 9 of the rolling stand 5.<br>
In a step S2 the control computer 6 determines which point 10<br>
of the rolled product 1 is currently in the rolling gap 9. The<br>
point 10 can be determined for example by way of a generally<br>
known material monitoring system 11.<br><br>
In a step S3 the control computer 6 compares the point 10<br>
determined in step S2 with the first change point 4. If the<br>
first change point 4 has not yet been reached - see for<br>
example Figure 3 - the control computer 6 returns to step S2.<br>
This return to step S2 on the one hand causes the rolling<br>
process, which was started in step S1, to be continued. On the<br>
other hand step S2 is executed again, so that as a result the<br>
control computer 6 determines in an ongoing manner while the<br>
rolled product 1 is being rolled in the rolling stand 5 which<br>
point of the rolled product. 1 is currently in the rolling gap<br>
9.<br>
If however the first change point 4 has been reached - see<br>
Figure 4 - in a step S4 the control computer terminates<br>
rolling of the rolled product 1 to the first desired dimension<br>
dl* by corresponding activation of the rolling stand 5.<br>
Regardless of further measures, which are implemented in a<br>
step S5 and which are set out in further detail below, this<br>
introduces a first step 12 into the rolled product 1 at the<br>
first change point 4.<br>
The further measures of step S5 can vary in nature. In the<br>
simplest instance - see Figure 5 - the rolling stand 5 is<br>
raised (naturally due to corresponding activation by the<br>
control computer 6), when the point 10 currently in the<br>
rolling gap 9 corresponds to the first change point 4. Raising<br>
the rolling stand 5 has the advantage that it can also be done<br>
by means of control elements, which can only be displaced when<br>
load-free. The rolled product 1 is then removed forward (see<br>
arrow V) or backward (see arrow R) from the rolling stand 5.<br>
Because the rolling stand 5 is raised, the rolled product 1<br><br>
therefore passes through the rolling gap 9 without being<br>
worked.<br>
It is however also possible for rolling per se to continue<br>
after the termination of rolling to the first desired<br>
dimension d1*. In contrast to the simple raising of the<br>
rolling stand 5 in this instance it is necessary for it to be<br>
possible to displace the control elements under load. In this<br>
instance for example - see Figure 6 - the rolling stand 5 can<br>
be set by the control computer 6 to a new (second) desired<br>
dimension d2* and the rolled product 1 can be rolled to the<br>
second desired dimension d2* in the direction of the rolled<br>
product end 3 after reaching the first change point 4.<br>
The second desired dimension d2* can be smaller than the first<br>
desired dimension dl*. It is preferably greater than the first<br>
desired dimension dl*, since it is then possible to set to the<br>
second desired dimension d2* more rapidly.<br>
If rolling continues, it is possible for the rolled product 1<br>
to be rolled to the second desired dimension d2* until the<br>
rolled product 1 has been rolled in its entirety, in other<br>
words the rolled product end 3 has passed through the rolling<br>
gap 9. It is however also possible - see Figure 7 - for<br>
rolling of the rolled product 1 to the second desired<br>
dimension d2* to be terminated, when the point 10 of the<br>
rolled product 1 currently in the rolling gap 9 corresponds to<br>
a previously determined second change point 13, which is<br>
located between the first change point 4 and the rolled<br>
product end 3. In this instance a second step 14 is introduced<br>
into the rolled product 1 at the second change point 13.<br><br>
The procedure for introducing the second step 14 at the second<br>
change point 14 is similar in every respect to the<br>
introduction of the first step 12 at the first change point 4.<br>
There is therefore no need for a detailed explanation here.<br>
Also the measures implemented after the introduction of the<br>
second step 14 are similar in every respect to the measures<br>
implemented after the introduction of the first step 12 at the<br>
first change point 4. In particular the rolling stand 5 can be<br>
raised - see Figure 8 - the rolling process being continued<br>
with a further desired dimension, etc.<br>
If the rolling gap 9 can be adjusted under load, it is also<br>
possible - starting from the state illustrated in Figure 4 -<br>
in the context of step S5 to continue the rolling process<br>
after the first change point 4 has been reached, but with the<br>
rolled product 1 being rolled in the direction of the rolled<br>
product start 2. In this instance the rolled product 1 is<br>
rolled to a second desired dimension d3*, the second desired<br>
dimension d3* - see Figure 9 - being smaller than the first<br>
desired dimension dl*.<br>
Theoretically it is possible for the rolled product 1 only to<br>
be rolled further from a point which is located between the<br>
first change point 4 and the rolled product start 2. However<br>
generally rolling to the second desired dimension d3* starts<br>
directly at the first change point 4.<br>
It is also possible for rolling of the rolled product 1 to the<br>
second desired dimension d3* to be terminated, when the point<br>
10 of the rolled product 1 currently in the rolling gap 9<br>
corresponds to a previously determined second change point 15.<br>
In this instance the second change point 15 is located between<br>
the rolled product start 2 and the first change point 4. In<br><br>
this instance a second step 16 is introduced into the rolled<br>
product 1 at the second change point 15. This is shown in<br>
Figure 10. Generally however the rolled product 1 is rolled to<br>
the second desired dimension d3* to the rolled product start<br>
2. This state is shown in Figure 11.<br>
Even if it is in principle possible to continue rolling from<br>
the first change point 4, the rolling stand 5 is generally<br>
raised, so that the rolled product 1 passes through the<br>
rolling gap 9 without being worked from the first change point<br>
4. This procedure has the advantage that it. can be carried out<br>
regardless of whether the rolling gap 9 can only be set in the<br>
load-free state or also under load. Regardless of this however<br>
the rolled product 1 has either passed through the rolling gap<br>
9 in its entirety at some point (in other words to the rolled<br>
product end 3) or the rolled product 1 has been drawn back in<br>
its entirety from the rolling gap 9 (in other words up to the<br>
rolled product start 2). Both these instances are examined<br>
further below.<br>
When the rolled product 1 has passed through the rolling gap 9<br>
in its entirety (in other words to the rolled product end 3)<br>
it is possible, starting with the rolled product end 3, to<br>
roll the rolled product 1 to a second desired dimension d4*,<br>
until the point 10 currently in the rolling gap 9 corresponds<br>
to a second change point 17, which is located between the<br>
first change point 4 and the rolled product end 3. In this<br>
instance a second step 18 is introduced into the rolled<br>
product 1 at the second change point 17. The procedure is<br>
similar in every respect to the introduction of the first step<br>
12 at the first change point 4, so there is no need for a<br>
detailed explanation of the procedure. The rolled product 1<br>
with the second step 18 introduced therein is shown in Figure<br><br>
12. In some instances more than one step can be introduced<br>
into the rolled product 1 in this pass too.<br>
When the rolled product 1 has been drawn back in its entirety<br>
from the rolling gap 9, in other words up to and including the<br>
rolled product start 2, it is possible to roll the rolled<br>
product 1 to a third desired dimension d5* after rolling to<br>
the first desired dimension d1* or - in the case of the<br>
embodiment in Figure 11 after rolling to the second desired<br>
dimension d3*. In this instance the rolling process starts<br>
with the rolled product start 2 and is executed until the<br>
point 10 of the rolled product 1 currently in the rolling gap<br>
9 corresponds to a second change point 19.<br>
It is possible - see Figure 13 - for the second change point<br>
19 to be located between the rolled product start 2 and the<br>
first change point 4. In this instance a second, additional<br>
step 20 is introduced into the rolled product 1 at the second<br>
change point 19. It is however also possible for the second<br>
change point 19 to correspond to the first change point 4. In<br>
this instance the first step 12 is increased - see Figure 14.<br>
It is thus possible by means of the procedures described above<br>
to produce a rolled product 1 in a simple manner, said rolled<br>
product 1 having a number of segments 21 to 25 according to<br>
Figure 15, which have differing dimensions dl to d5 from one<br>
another. It is in particular possible to produce the rolled<br>
product 1 shown in Figure 15 even if the rolling stand 5 has<br>
control facilities for setting the rolling gap 9 that can only<br>
be adjusted in the load-free state, in other words not under<br>
load. The procedures described above can hereby be combined<br>
with one another in almost any manner.<br><br>

characterized in that rolling of the rolled product (1) to the<br>
second desired dimension (d2*) is terminated, when the point<br><br>
(10) of the rolled product (1) currently in the rolling gap<br>
(9)	corresponds to a previously determined second change point<br>
(13), which is located between the first change point (4) and<br>
the rolled product end (3), so that a second step (14) is<br>
introduced into the rolled product (1) at the second change<br>
point (13) .<br>
5.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 1,<br>
characterized in that the rolled product (1) is rolled to a<br>
second desired dimension (d3*) in the direction of the rolled<br>
product start (2) after reaching the first change point (4).<br>
6.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 5,<br>
characterized in that rolling of the rolled product (1) to the<br>
second desired dimension (d3*) is terminated, when the point<br>
(10)	of the rolled product (1) currently in the rolling gap<br>
(9) corresponds to a previously determined second change point<br>
(15), which is located between the rolled product start (2)<br>
and the first change point (4), so that a second step (16) is<br>
introduced into the rolled product (1) at the second change<br>
point (15).<br>
7.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 5,<br>
characterized in that the rolled product (1) is rolled to the<br>
second desired dimension (d3*) to the rolled product start<br>
(2) .<br>
8.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 1,<br>
characterized in that the rolling stand (5) is raised, when<br>
the point (10) of the rolled product (1) currently in the<br>
rolling gap (9) corresponds to the first change point (4), so<br>
that the rolled product (1) passes through the rolling gap (9)<br>
without being worked after the rolling stand (5) has been<br><br>
raised.<br>
9.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 8,<br>
characterized in that the rolled product (1) passes through<br>
the rolling stand (5) backward.<br>
10.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 7 or 9,<br>
characterized in that after rolling to the first desired<br>
dimension (dl*) or to the second desired dimension (d3*), the<br>
rolled product (1) is rolled to a third desired dimension<br>
(d5*) in the rolling gap (9) of the rolling stand (5) starting<br>
with the rolled product start (2), until the point (10) of the<br>
rolled product (1) currently in the rolling gap (9)<br>
corresponds to a second change point (19).<br>
11.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 10,<br>
characterized in that the second change point (19) is located<br>
between the rolled product start (2) and the first change<br>
point (4) so that a second step is introduced into the rolled<br>
product (1) at the second change point (19).<br>
12.	The rolling method as claimed in claim 10,<br>
characterized in that the second change point (19) corresponds<br>
to the first change point (4) so the first step (12) is<br>
increased.<br>
13.	The rolling method as claimed in one of the preceding<br>
claims,<br>
characterized in that the rolled product (1) passes in its<br>
entirety through the rolling stand (5) and then, starting with<br>
the rolled product end (3), is rolled to a second desired<br>
dimension (d4*) until the point currently in the rolling gap<br>
(9) corresponds to a second change point (17), which is<br><br>
located between the first change point (4) and the rolled<br>
product end (3) so that a second step (18) is introduced into<br>
the rolled product (1) at the second change point (17).<br>
14.	A data medium with a computer program (7) stored on the<br>
data medium for implementing a rolling method as claimed in<br>
one of the preceding claims, when the computer program (7) is<br>
executed by a control computer (6) for a rolling stand (5).<br>
15.	A control computer for a rolling stand (5), which is<br>
configured, in particular programmed, so that the rolling<br>
stand (5) can be activated by it according to a rolling method<br>
as claimed in one of claims 1 to 13.<br>
16.	A rolled product, in particular a strip-type rolled<br>
product, characterized in that it was produced according to a<br>
rolling method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 13.<br>
17.	A rolled product, in particular a strip-type rolled<br>
product, characterized in that it has at least two segments<br>
(21 to 25) in the longitudinal direction, which have differing<br>
dimensions (d1 to d5) from one another.<br><br>
A rolled product (1) has a rolled product start (2) and a rolled product end (3). The rolled product (1) is rolled to a first desired dimension (dl*) in a rolling gap (9) of a<br>
rolling stand (5), starting with the rolled product start (2). It is determined in an ongoing manner by a control computer (6) while the rolled product (1) is being rolled in the<br>
rolling stand (5) which point (10) of the rolled product (1) is currently in the rolling gap (9). Rolling of the rolled product (1) to the first desired dimension (dl*) is terminated, when the point (10) of the rolled product (1) currently in the rolling gap (9) corresponds to a previously determined first change point (4) of the rolled product (1), which is located between the rolled product start (2) and the rolled product end (3), so that a first step (12) is<br>
introduced into the rolled product (1) at the first change point (4).</td>
