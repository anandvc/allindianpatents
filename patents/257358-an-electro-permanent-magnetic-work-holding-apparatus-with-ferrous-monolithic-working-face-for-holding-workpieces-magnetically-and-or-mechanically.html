				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an electro permanent<br>
magnetic work holding apparatus for holding work pieces<br>
magnetically and/ or mechanically. This invention more<br>
particularly relates to an electro permanent magnetic<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated as 'EPM' in this specification for the<br>
sake of brevity and convenience) work holding apparatus having a<br>
monolithic ferrous working face with slots of desired shape and<br>
configuration separating the magnetic poles, thereby rendering<br>
the apparatus suitable for holding the work pieces both<br>
magnetically and/ or mechanically in the course of working/<br>
machining/ anchoring. Usually such slots are made around the<br>
perimeter of the poles, thereby minimizing reduction in active<br>
magnetic area of the working face. The subject invention also<br>
pertains to a work holding apparatus with at least one non-<br>
reversible permanent magnet, and at least another reversible<br>
permanent magnet suitably placed, which may be commissioned for<br>
work holding by switching electrically, whereby a work piece<br>
material is held in place without the use of additional pole<br>
separators.<br>
In metal working machines such as CNC machining center,<br>
milling machines, electrical discharge machines (EDM), grinding<br>
machine, etc., a magnetic work holding apparatus is often used<br>
as a worktable, whereby a work piece to be machined can be held<br>
securely on the worktable by magnetic force, and then machining<br>
operation may be performed on the work piece.<br>
The principal property of a magnet is its capability to<br>
attract ferromagnetic materials resulting from flow of magnetic<br>
energy called "flux" between magnetic north and south poles.<br>
When a ferromagnetic work piece is placed across the poles of a<br><br><br>
magnet, the "flux" passes through and the work piece gets<br>
attracted. The intensity of attraction or pull becomes stronger<br>
with the decrease in the distance of separation between the work<br>
piece and the magnet. Moreover, strength of attraction of a<br>
magnet is the function of the quantum of induction of magnetic<br>
flux into the work piece. It has also been observed that smooth<br>
surfaces are better attracted and held in position in comparison<br>
to uneven or rough surface.<br>
In the prior art, Electro permanent magnetic (EPM) work<br>
holding apparatuses of flux reversal type are known in which a<br>
magnetic circuit is activated or deactivated by reversing the<br>
poles of the permanent magnets of the device. This is a<br>
combination of permanent magnetic and electro magnetic devices:<br>
it presents the advantages of the latter without the<br>
disadvantages of the former. These devices uses intrinsic energy<br>
of the permanent magnetic device but instead of being switched<br>
"ON" or "OFF" mechanically, it requires electrical pulse similar<br>
to electro magnetic devices but only momentarily delivered by an<br>
electrical winding. Once switched "ON", these devices provide<br>
magnetic force for infinite duration of time independent of any<br>
external energy source. For instance, US Patent No. 4507635<br>
granted to Michele Cardone of Milan, Italy, pertains to a<br>
magnetic anchoring apparatus, comprising in combination: an<br>
external ferromagnetic crown provided with a base plate and<br>
lateral walls; at least one group of four pole pieces defining<br>
pairs of corresponding poles of an anchoring surface, said pole<br>
pieces presenting their longitudinal axes at right angles to the<br>
base place and in correspondence with the apexes of a square.<br>
Moreover, the apparatus comprises a plurality of permanent<br>
magnets for feeding the aforesaid poles, interposed between the<br><br><br>
pole pieces, and between the latter and said ferromagnetic<br>
crown.<br>
Types of magnets presently available have magnetic poles<br>
(north and south) which are separated by non-magnetic insulators<br>
between the individual poles. The magnetic insulating material<br>
generally used may be selected from the group of epoxy,<br>
aluminum, brass, stainless steel, etc.<br>
As the coefficient of thermal expansion of each material is<br>
different, the working surface of the existing magnetic work<br>
holding device is not stable when there is a rise in temperature<br>
during machining operation. This difference causes unstable<br>
surface and often creates small opening(s) for coolant<br>
(sometimes flooded coolant fluid is used during machining) to<br>
enter inside the work holding device and short circuit the<br>
winding/ joints or hamper with the insulation resistance of the<br>
winding.<br>
Normally in this conventional work holding device, all poles<br>
are individually machined and assembled, which gives rise to a<br>
possibility of the presence of weak points on the top working<br>
face. Moreover as multiple numbers of pieces are to be handled,<br>
it makes the manufacturing process difficult and time consuming.<br>
It is impractical to repair these chucks as any process of<br>
repair cannot begin without destroying the chuck.<br>
Moreover, another drawback of the conventional magnetic work<br>
holding apparatus is that it cannot be used for holding<br>
diamagnetic or paramagnetic work pieces, as a result of which<br><br><br>
they normally had to be removed from the working bed of the<br>
machine or a holding means such as a clamp or vice had to be<br>
mounted on top of the apparatus to hold diamagnetic or<br>
paramagnetic jobs. Any other provision for clamping the work<br>
piece also significantly reduces the active magnetic area of the<br>
working face.<br>
Present invention aims at circumventing and finding an<br>
effective solution to the difficulties mentioned above.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a novel<br>
dual purpose magnetic and/or mechanical work holding apparatus<br>
for machining/ working/ anchoring the work pieces which may be<br>
ferromagnetic, diamagnetic or even paramagnetic.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a work<br>
holding apparatus having a monolithic ferrous working face with<br>
slots separating the magnetic poles.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a work<br>
holding apparatus having a monolithic ferrous working face<br>
having "T" slots for insertion of clamping-cum-holding device to<br>
hold diamagnetic or paramagnetic work pieces for being worked<br>
upon.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an EPM work<br>
holding apparatus having a monolithic working face wherein there<br>
are provided a plurality of slots resembling inverted "T" (tee-<br>
slots) or a truncated dumb-bell across the entire length and/ or<br>
width of the said apparatus which separate the magnetic poles<br><br><br>
and simultaneously can be used to clamp jobs mechanically for being worked<br>
upon.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a magnetic work holding<br>
apparatus with a ferrous monolithic working face capable of being used for<br>
anchoring of ferrous metal parts, components or entire apparatus magnetically.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the invention which relates to an<br>
electro permanent magnetic work holding apparatus with monolithic working<br>
face for holding work pieces magnetically and/or mechanically, characterized in<br>
that the said apparatus comprises a base plate and a ferrous monolithic working<br>
face, the said base plate having a pocket or recess which houses reversible<br>
magnets and electrical windings, the said working face has magnetic poles which<br>
are demarked by slots, and on the opposite side of the said working face recesses<br>
are provided beneath the said slots for housing the non-reversible permanent<br>
magnets.<br>
The work holding device is usually provided with tee-slots, resembling an<br>
inverted Tee, running across the length and/or width of the work holding<br>
apparatus, which not only separate the magnetic poles but also enables work<br>
pieces or jobs to be held either magnetically and/or mechanically.<br>
The slots may also be made in the shape of a truncated dump-bell in lieu<br>
of a tee-slot, or any other suitable shape for convenience of operation/anchoring,<br>
the latter being preferred for convenience of operation and easy availability of<br>
clamping equipments.<br><br><br>
Usually such slots are made around the perimeter of the<br>
poles, thereby minimizing reduction in active magnetic area of<br>
the poles. Tee-slots enable diamagnetic or paramagnetic<br>
materials like brass, aluminum, stainless steel, copper, etc. to<br>
be clamped and worked upon.<br>
This invention will now be described by means of the<br>
illustrative drawings accompanying this specification, in which-<br>
Fig.1. shows the longitudinal cross-sectional view of the<br>
work holding apparatus;<br>
Fig.2. gives a view of the electro permanent work holding<br>
apparatus holding magnetically a ferromagnetic<br>
job, and<br>
Fig.3. depicts a view of the electro permanent work<br>
holding apparatus holding a job with the help of<br>
mechanical clamps.<br>
Referring to the aforementioned figures of the drawings, in<br>
Fig.1 work holding face of the apparatus is (1), the base plate<br>
is (2), (3) shows the electrical windings, demarked magnetic<br>
poles are (4), first set of permanent, but reversible magnets<br>
are denoted by (6) and the second set of permanent, non-<br>
reversible, magnets are represented by (5) . The work holding<br>
face (1) also shows the tee-slots (7) running across the length<br>
and/ or width of the work holding apparatus, which are brought<br>
into play while dealing with a diamagnetic or paramagnetic job.<br><br>
Fig.2. shows the assembly holding ferrous job (8)<br>
magnetically, obviating the need to deploy<br>
additional holding means.<br>
In Fig. 3. There is shown a view of the apparatus of the<br>
subject invention (1) holding a job (8), usually<br>
diamagnetic or paramagnetic, with the help of<br>
mechanical clamps (9).<br>
From the foregoing it may be seen that the magnetic bed of<br>
this invention could also be used as a machine bed, thereby<br>
enhancing the life of the original machine bed.<br>
The working face of the holding apparatus is obtained from a<br>
monolithic block of ferromagnetic material, wherein the poles<br>
are demarked by making slots in the said block, obviating the<br>
need to use filler material(s).<br>
Moreover, instead of using numerous pole pieces depending on<br>
the number of poles as was being used earlier, only a single<br>
block of ferromagnetic material needs to be handled in the<br>
present instance, rendering its manufacture relatively simple,<br>
yet sturdy and stable.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention resides in a<br>
magnetic work holding apparatus, which is a variant of the<br>
electro permanent magnetic work holding apparatus as described<br>
and illustrated hereinabove, equipped with a monolithic working<br>
face of a ferromagnetic material capable of being used for<br>
anchoring/ hoisting of ferrous metal parts, components or whole<br>
machine. The said variant electro permanent magnetic work holder<br><br>
suitable for holding ferromagnetic objects, having at least two<br>
poles, each one of which has a non-reversible permanent magnet<br>
and a reversible permanent magnet surrounded by an electrical<br>
winding which is used for effecting reversal of the magnetic<br>
poles of the reversible magnet.<br>
This apparatus is obtained from two pieces of ferromagnetic<br>
material, one serving as the top working face and the other as<br>
base plate, wherein poles are demarcated in the top working face<br>
of the work holder by making recesses in the monolithic block<br>
and cavities are made on the opposite side of the poles for<br>
locating/ positioning reversible and non-reversible permanent<br>
magnets, the former being placed on the backside of the pole<br>
surrounded by an electrical winding and the latter are placed on<br>
the surface nearest the top working face. The top working face<br>
provides a stable and leak-proof working surface.<br>
A second monolithic ferrous surface may be introduced in such<br>
a manner that it holds the reversible permanent magnets between<br>
the poles and base plate in a sandwiched manner and on the base<br>
plate pockets are made for housing the non-reversible permanent<br>
magnets directly below the demarcated poles.<br>
This embodiment of the invention has been illustrated in Fig.<br>
1, 2, and 3 of the drawings accompanying the Provisional<br>
Specification No. 345/KOL/2005 dated 25.04.2005, wherein -<br>
Fig.1. represents the longitudinal cross sectional view<br>
of the top working face of the work holding<br>
apparatus of this invention;<br><br>
Fig.2. shows the flux circulation within the work holder<br>
in demagnetized condition, and<br>
Fig.3. exhibits the flux circulating within the work<br>
holder in magnetized condition.<br>
In Fig. 1, the monolithic ferrous working face (1) has two<br>
sets of permanent magnets assembled beneath it. The magnetic<br>
orientation of one of the sets, called reversible permanent<br>
magnets (6) is reversed electrically using the electrical<br>
windings (3) around it, depending upon whether to clamp the<br>
ferromagnetic job (called ON condition) or to release the<br>
ferromagnetic job (called OFF condition). The second set of<br>
permanent magnets called non-reversible permanent magnets (5),<br>
which are not reversed, are placed between the poles (4). A base<br>
plate (2) has a recess which houses the reversible permanent<br>
magnets (6) in such a way that it is sandwiched between the<br>
working face (1) and bottom plate (2).<br>
As pointed out earlier, structural stability of the<br>
conventional equipments was not satisfactory, particularly while<br>
carrying on heavy machining applications. The filler material,<br>
usually epoxy compound, also was a source of problems, as it led<br>
to unequal heating of the work holding surface posing accuracy<br>
problems. Leakage/ seepage of the coolant into the magnets<br>
affected the performance of the apparatus.<br>
The present invention successfully tackled the above problems<br>
by recasting the design of the work holding equipment by<br>
machining out the top working face and the side walls from a<br><br><br>
monolithic ferrous block, which rendered the structure quite<br>
rigid.<br>
The monolithic structure of the subject invention also has<br>
recesses for demarking the magnetic poles, which eliminates the<br>
need to use any filler material. Furthermore, instead of<br>
plurality of pole pieces required in conventional equipments<br>
depending on the number of poles, only a single ferrous block<br>
needs to be handled, which makes the manufacture quite easy.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention may be briefly<br>
laid down as follows:<br>
1.	Presence of "T" slots enable secure handling of work pieces<br>
even for diamagnetic or paramagnetic substances, holding them<br>
mechanically.<br>
2.	All poles and sidewalls are well-connected being made from a<br>
monolithic ferrous block, which adds stability to the structure.<br>
3.	The Working face is entirely leak-proof and no liquid/<br>
coolant can seep in from the top working face.<br>
4.	The need to use filler material on top is dispended with as<br>
the working face is fabricated from a monolithic block of<br>
ferromagnetic material, on which magnetic poles are well-marked.<br>
5.	As the working face of the subject apparatus is fabricated<br>
from a single block of ferromagnetic material, the heat<br>
generated during machining operation like milling, shearing,<br>
grinding, etc. is evenly distributed throughout the work holding<br><br><br>
surface, thereby substantially reducing any possibility of<br>
unequal deformation.<br>
6.	The slots are made around the perimeter of the poles which<br>
ensures minimum reduction of active magnetic area.<br>
7.	Repairing of electrical winding pose no problem or difficulty<br>
as the winding can be easily accessed by mere separation of the<br>
base and the top working face.<br>
8.	This ensures a simplified manufacturing of magnetic circuit<br>
which normally separate adjacent magnetic poles of different<br>
polarities resulting in a considerable reduction of<br>
manufacturing costs and with better performance.<br>
Additional modifications and improvements of the present<br>
invention may also be apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus<br>
the particular combination of parts described and illustrated<br>
herein is intended to represent only one embodiment of this<br>
invention with a variation and is not intended to serve as<br>
limitation of alternative devices or features within the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br>
