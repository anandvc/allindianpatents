				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for carrying out a bio-reaction. In particular, though not limited thereto, this invention relates to fluidised floe bio-reactor apparatus, and which may advantageously be employed for treatment of waste water.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose to an improved apparatus for carrying out a fluidised floe bio-reaction.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose to an improved apparatus for carrying out a fluidised floe bio-reaction and wherein a bioconversion is effected by biomass in the form of floes.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose to an improved apparatus for carrying out a fluidised floe bio-reaction and which does not require any solids settling devices.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose to an improved apparatus for carrying out a fluidised floe bio-reaction and wherein a carrier material is not required for biomass growth.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose to an improved apparatus for carrying out a fluidised floe bio-reaction and wherein a biomass concentration is maintained at steady state by biomass wastage from bottom of the column.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a fluidised floe bio-reactor apparatus for carrying out a bio-reaction process that may advantageously be employed, for example for treatment of waste water comprising a reactor having a height H and a diameter D with a ratio between 5:1 to 30:1, said reactor having a truncated cone provided at the upper end of said reactor which acts as phase separator.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the reactor comprises a cylindrical or tapered reactor and preferably disposed in an upright or vertical position. An inlet port is provided at the lower end of the reactor for introduction of the fluid. A plurality of outlets is provided at<br>
different heights for removal of the floes. An outlet port is provided at upper end of the reactor.<br>
In the instance when the reactor is cylinderical the height to diameter ratio is 5.1 to 20:1 and preferably 10:1 to 20:1.<br>
As described hereinabove, a truncated cone is provided at the upper portion and which acts as a phase separator. A truncated cone is also preferably provided at the lower end and in a direction opposite to the upper truncated cone. The lower, truncated cone is a liquid distributor. The upper and lower truncated cones may be of the same or different sizes.<br>
Preferably the cone has a diameter between 0.5 to 0.8D.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a bio-conversion is brought about by floes of the microorganisms present in the reactor. The fluid containing the reactants enters at the inlet preferably with such a velocity so that the floes are retained in the fluidised state. As soon as the bio-conversion progresses, the floes grow in size and settle at the said bottom end of the said reactor.<br>
In order to maintain the steady state operation of the bio-reactor, very large floe particles are regularly removed from the outlet of the reactor in order to maintain the steady state operation of the said bio-reactor.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1   shows the bioreactor in accordance with one embodiment of this invention; and Fig. 2 shows the bioreactor in accordance with another embodiment.<br>
Referring in particular to Fig. 1, the bioreactor 1 of the present invention and in the embodiment of Fig. 1, comprises a cylindrical elongate reactor and normally disposed along the vertical axis when in an operative status.  Reactor 1 has an inlet 2 disposed in the proximity of the base for introduction of the fluid to be introduced.   A distributor 3 is provided at the lower end of reactor 1 for causing a uniform distribution of the fluid in the reaction zone 4 of bioreactor 1.  Preferably, distributor 3 is a truncated cone and positioned in the proximity of inlet 2.<br>
Reactor vessel 1 has a height H and diameter D and the ratio of the height H to diameter D is 5:1 to 30:1. Preferably, such a ratio is 10:20. The truncated cone 3 has a diameter of 0.5 to 0.8 D.<br>
The micro organisms contained in the medium grow in size in reaction zone 4 into floes, which settle down and removed from outlet 5 to obtain a steady state condition. Reactor 1 has additional ports 6 for removal of the floes.<br>
Reactor 1 extends into an enlarged head 7, and having a separator 8 for causing a separation of the floes and gaseous products.  Preferably, separator 8 also comprises a truncated cone but disposed in a direction opposite to that of cone 3.   An outlet port 9 is provided in head 7.  Outlet port 7 may be connected, if required, to inlet 2 through a pump (not shown) in the instance that the effluent is to be recycled.   A gas outlet 10 is provided at the upper end of vessel 1.<br>
The reactor 11 of Fig. 2 is identical in construction to that of Fig. 1, and for this purpose like reference numerals are provided in Fig. 2 to illustrate parts of Fig. 1.  However, reactor 11 of Fig. 2 is an expanded reactor and in which the diameter increases with height.  The increase in diameter per unit length may be between 0.05 to 0.15.<br><br>
The presently disclosed apparatus for carrying out bio-reaction offers various advantages over the presently known apparatuses, such a high rates of bio-conversion due to high concentration of bio-mass; excellent mixing characteristics due to the fluidized nature of the contents of the said reactor, thereby removing any mass transfer resistance to substrate in the bulk liquid; almost clarified liquid coming out at the said top end of the said reactor, reducing the need for further solid-liquid separation stages; steady state operation of the said reactor with the constant bio-mass concentration; adaptability of the said reactor to any sudden changes in the feeding pattern or feed concentration and last but not least easy control of process through solids withdrawal from the said bottom end.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a apparatus for carrying out bio reaction, .the said apparatus comprising of a reactor having a diameter D and height H and wherein the height H is greater than the diameter D, an inlet in the proximity of the base for introduction of a liquid, a liquid distributor within said reactor and in the proximity of<br>
said inlet, a phase separator at the upper end, a gaseous outlet at the upper end of said<br>
reactor is- characterized ifr-that the said reactor enables any bio-mass in the reactor to<br>
remain in a fluidized state during the course of operation of the said reactor.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
