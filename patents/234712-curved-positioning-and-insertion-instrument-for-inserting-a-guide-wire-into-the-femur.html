				<td>FORM 2THE PATENT ACT 1970(39 of 1970)&amp;The Patents Rules, 2003       COMPLETE SPECIFICATION(See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1.	CURVED POSITIONING AND INSERTION INSTRUMENT FOR INSERTING A GUIDE WIRE INTO THE FEMUR<br>
2.(A) Synthes GmbH(b)	SWITZERLAND(c)	Eimattstrasse 3,CH-4436 Oberdorf,Switzerland<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The invention relates to a curved positioning and insertion instrument for inserting a guide wire into the femur for precise bone opening.<br>
Precise bone opening requires a reliable reference in position and direction which a surgeon with a drill or cutter can use as a guide. It is known that guide wires which are inserted (drilled or tapped) into the femur prior to drilling in order to guide the drill safely are used for this purpose.<br>
US-A-6074392 describes such a curved positioning and insertion instrument for inserting a guide wire into the femur, comprising a curved guide tube having a distal end for' placing on the trochanter and a proximal end for pushing in a guide wire, comprising a retaining arm for the connection between the guide tube and a handle. This design has been chosen because the insertion of a guide wire along a curve is advantageous-with regard to the anatomy of the human femora, and the tissue in the affected region is therefore impaired to a lesser extent during an operation.<br>
US-A-6074392 therefore describes an instrument design comprising a key element which consists of a curved guide tube for a curved guide wire. This guide wire is inserted into the bone and serves as a guide path for a hollow and flexible drill. The guide wire is mounted with the aid of a positioning and insertion instrument, the curved guide tube being mounted by means of a support part on a handle which can be properly held by the surgeon.  The exact positioning of the guide tube<br>
2<br><br>
is implemented by means of X-rays or by direct inspection. After positioning, the guide wire is hammered in along the longitudinal axis of the bone or driven in in another manner. Thereafter, the insertion instrument is removed and the flexible drill or cutter is passed over the guide wire. After drilling is complete, everything is removed.<br>
However, the weak point of this solution is that there is no particular possibility for correction if the X-ray image shows that the guide wire is not optimally positioned.<br>
In a completely different design, for example according to US-A-5951561 a guide instrument which has the possibility of correction of guide wires is also described. However, this design consists of a bulky sheath which receives a rotary cylindrical component comprising a plurality of discs each having a plurality of holes, which have to be oriented concentrically with one another in a complicated production process and in addition provide no possibility for tapping a guide wire along a curve into the femur. To this extent, this design offers no improvement for a design according to the generic type.<br>
It is now the object of the invention to permit corrections by means of a simple device, the intention being to impair the tissue in the affected region as little as possible. For this reason, as already noted above, the person skilled in the* art will not * at all have used US-A-5951561 as prior art for achieving the present object.  It is also comprehensible that US-A-<br>
3<br><br>
6074392 published in 1998 is itself a further development of US-A-5624447 published in 1997, while US-A-5951561 was published in the same year as US-A-6074392 and therefore followed another parallel route for setting guide wires.<br>
Further but less relevant documents relating to the prior art are US-A-4466429, US-A-3439671, US-A-5135527, US-A-5112336, US-A-4712541, US-Bl-6273892.<br>
In order to achieve the object, the inventor now presents a novel positioning and insertion instrument which comprises a handle which is arranged by means of a retaining arm on a curved guide tube. At the end thereof there is a positioning hook with, if appropriate, a guide bore which is oriented at an angle of 6° - 30°, preferably 7° - 20°, in particular about 8°, relative to the guide tube. In addition to this bore, various correction bores are present, according to an improved further development. Furthermore, a T-handle is reqired when the instrument according to the invention is used. The invention thus makes it possible to insert at least one guide wire which subsequently guides an opening drill. Instead of a T-handle or a motorised drilling or tapping drive, it is also possible to provide an impact head so that the guide wire can be hammered in.<br>
According to the invention, during use in practice, the guide tube is, if appropriate, first loaded with a reference guide wire. The handle of the positioning and insertion instrument is then aligned by visual inspection approximately parallel to the longitudinal<br>
4<br><br>
axis of the femur and with the extension of the intramedullary canal thereof. The positioning hook is placed on the trochanter and the nose of the hook is forced by pressure in the medial direction into 'the muscle (gluteus medius) , the reference guide wire being inserted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the femur. The instrument is removed. Thereafter, the guide tube of the positioning and insertion instrument is loaded with an opening guide wire and, according to this method of use, the guide bore in the positioning hook is pushed over the reference guide wire and thus once again placed on the trochanter. Because the guide bore in the positioning hook is set at about 8° the positioning' and insertion instrument becomes aligned accordingly in order to give the opening guide wire the correct angle. This procedure is carried out because it is more difficult to estimate a certain angle visually than a parallelism. If, however, the reference guide wire were to happen to fit the first time, it would also be possible to use it as an opening guide wire. As a rule, however, it is expected that a second guide wire has to be set as the opening guide wire.<br>
A number of embodiments without a guide bore dispenses with the insertion of the reference guide wire and ensures the placing of the positioning and insertion instrument at the correct site and angle by the particular characteristics of its positioning hook which are adapted to the anatomical conditions. The design of these hooks is therefore chosen so that, when gently pressed into the medial muscle and when placed on the trochanter,  the hook comes to rest in the<br>
5<br><br>
optimum position for insertion of the opening guide wire in the majority of applications. The nose is designed so that it can be pressed into the medial muscle while protecting soft tissue. Its thickness is about 0.5-10mm, preferably about l-5mm and in particular about 2.5mm. The length between the centre of the guide tube and the tip of the nose of the positioning hook may vary, depending on the soft tissue situation, between about 10-30mm, preferably about 15-25mm, and is in particular about 20mm. The correction bores have a diameter of about l-5mm, preferably about 1.8-3.6 and in particular about 3.3mm. The receptacle for the guide tube is about 3-20mm, preferably about 6-10mm and in particular about 8mm.<br>
If the opening guide wire is also inserted into the trochanter, it is approximately at an optimum angle of about 8° relative to the reference guide wire in the frontal plane at its insertion point. X-ray images can now confirm whether the opening guide wire is in the correct position for implementing the opening. However, if it is, for example, too close to the lateral cortex there is according to the invention the possibility of a correction with the aid of the positioning and insertion instrument. This is then pushed with one of its correction bores over the reference or opening guide wire and a further/ previously loaded, opening guide wire is inserted in a new position into the trochanter. The old opening guide wire which was not correctly positioned can then be removed. If required, such a correction measure can be made on the basis of the only set reference guide wire by directly pushing a correction bore, instead of<br>
6<br><br>
the guide bore, onto the reference guide wire.<br>
Further developments of the invention are indicated in the figures and in the dependent patent claims/ Claim 10 describes a novel method improved compared with the prior art and intended for placing an opening guide wire.<br>

Fig. 1 shows the individual components which as a rule are required in using the instrument according to the invention. The positioning and insertion instrument 1 consists of- a curved guide tube 2, at the distal end of which a positioning hook 3 is arranged. The curvature of the guide tube 2 describes a radius of about 300 to 800mm, preferably 500 to 700mm, in particular about 600mm. The positioning hook 3 is formed in such a way that it is retained on the tip of the greater trochanter and the medial muscle. In the region of the proximal end of the guide tube 2, mounted approximately perpendicularly thereto, is a retaining arm 4 which then curves in order to run approximately parallel to the guide tube 2. A handle 5, the longitudinal axis of which is approximately parallel to a tangent to the guide tube 2 in the region of the positioning hook 3, is present at the end of the retaining arm 4. Furthermore, fig. 1 shows two guide wires 50 which are such that they can be inserted into the guide tube 2 and can be used either as reference guide wire 50a or as' ' opening guide" wire 50b. In addition -a hollow opening drill 20 is shown, which is formed in such a way that it can be passed over a guide wire 50 and can<br>
11<br><br>
be operated by a T-handle 30. Finally, fig. 1 shows the above mentioned T-handle 30 with a lever 32 and a grill chuck, which fits both onto the guide wires 50 and on to the opening drill 20.' Of course, motor-driven drilling and tapping drives are of course also possible as an alternative to the T-handle.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the positioning and insertion instrument 1 with a guide wire 50 loaded into the guide tube 2. The guide wire 50 can be inserted at the proximal or distal end of the positioning and insertion instrument 1, which leads to at least temporary curvature of the guide wire 50.<br>
Fig. 3a and fig. 3b show the positioning hook 3 of the positioning and insertion instrument 1, comprising a guide bore 6, which is set at an angle of about 8° in the nose 11 relative to the guide tube 2 and the central bore thereof. In addition to this bore, various correction bores are present, in particular an anterior/posterior correction bore 7, a medial correction bore 8, a posterior/anterior correction bore 9 and a lateral correction bore 10.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the positioning and insertion instrument 1 with a guide wire 50 lowered into the guide tube 2, which instrument is placed on the greater trochanter 41 of a femur 40. The characteristics of the positioning hook 3 ensure proper non slip positioning on the surface of the trochanter 41 and in the medial muscle 45.' The handlers of the positioning and insertion instrument 1 is aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the femur 40 and parallel to the extension of<br>
12<br><br>
the intramedullary canal thereof. The T-handle 30 is shown in the position in which it is capable of inserting the guide wire 50.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the positioning and insertion instrument 1 which is just being pushed along its guide bore 6 on the reference guide wire 50a already inserted into the trochanter 41 of the femur 40. The positioning and insertion instrument 1 or its guide tube 2 is loaded with an opening guide wire 50b.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the positioning and insertion instrument 1 which has been pushed through the guide bore 6 over the reference guide wire 50a already inserted into the trochanter 41 of the femur 40. The positioning and insertion instrument 1 is correctly positioned corresponding to the angle of about 8° in the frontal plane of the guide bore 6, in order to insert the already loaded opening guide wire 50b. The T-handle 30 is shown in the position in which it is capable of inserting the opening guide wire 50b.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the opening drill 20 when it has been pushed over the inserted opening guide wire 50b. The T-handle 30 is shown in the position in which it is capable of inserting the opening drill 20 into the trochanter 41 of the femur 40.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an X-ray image which shows the positioning hook 3 of the positioning and insertion instrument 1 arid a guide wire 50 loaded in the guide tube 2 and inserted into the trochanter 41 of the femur 40. Proper positioning by means of the characteristics of<br>
13<br><br>
the positioning hook 3 on the surface of the trochanter 41 is evident. The guide wire 50 has been inserted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the femur 40 and in the intramedullary canal thereof.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an X-ray image which shows the positioning hook 3 of the positioning and insertion instrument 1, which has been pushed via its guide bore 6 over the reference guide wire 50a already inserted into the trochanter 41 of the femur 40. The positioning and insertion instrument 1, is optimally correctly positioned, corresponding to the angle of about 8°, in the frontal plane of the guide bore 6, in order to insert the already loaded opening guide wire 50b.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an X-ray image which shows the reference guide wire 50a and opening guide wire 50b inserted into the trochanter 41 of the femur 40. The desired insertion angle 42 of about 8° between reference guide wire 50a and opening guide wire 50b is clearly recognisable.<br>
Fig. 11 shows an X-ray image which shows the remaining opening guide wire 50b optionally after removal of the reference guide wire 50a. In this example, the opening guide wire 50b is located too close to the lateral cortex to implement the opening and has to be corrected.<br>
Fig. 12 shows an X-ray image which shows the correction of the opening guide wire 50b. A second opening guide wire 50b is inserted into the trochanter 41 parallel to the guide wire 50b.<br>
14<br><br>
Fig. 13 shows an X-ray image which shows the corrected opening guide wire 50b after removal of the first opening guide wire 50b.' It' is now located optimally for implementing the opening by means of opening drill 20.<br>
Fig. 14 shows an X-ray image which shows the implemented opening 43 of the trochanter 41 of the femur 4 0.<br>
Fig. 15a and fig. 15b show the positioning hook 3 of the positioning and insertion instrument 1, which positioning- hook has no guide bore, comprising various correction bores, in particular an anterior/posterior correction bore 7, a medial correction bore 8, a posterior/anterior correction bore 9 and a lateral correction bore 10. In comparison with the variant shown in fig. 3a and fig. 3b, the nose 11 is also markedly thinner.<br>

Abstract<br>
A curved positioning and insertion instrument for<br>
inserting a guide wire (50) into the femur has a curved<br>
guide	tube<br>
(2) with a distal end to be placed .on the trochanter (41) and/or the medial muscle (45) and a proximal end for inserting a guide wire If (50). The instrument also has a holding arm (4) that links the guide tube (2) to a handle (5) . A positioning hook fitted with at least one correction bore (7, 8, 9, 10, 12) for receiving the guide wire (50) or another guide wire is arranged at the distal end of the guide tube (2) . This structure makes it possible to easily insert further or additional guide wires (50) relative to a reference guide wire (50) .<br></td>
