BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Generally, nano crystalline particles, such as Titanium di oxide<br>
powder, have been conventionally prepared by a sol-gel method and by chloride process. The sol-gel method requires additional heat treatments, which makes the sol-gel method difficult to perform continuously and thereby incurs a high production cost. The chloride process used for producing Titanium di oxide requires a particular apparatus due to its high temperature and pressure reactions. Further, the chloride process requires an additional protective facility from corrosive gases (CF, FIG) produced during the process, which leads to higher production cost. Moreover, special devices are employed for applying electric fields or controlling the reactanl mixing ratio to control the shape and size of Ti02 particles.<br>
[0003]	Further, patent application WO2008079311 describes a process for<br>
making suspensions of finely divided amorphous Titanium oxide particles and converting the particles to anatase Titanium di oxide. Further, the anatase Titanium di oxide is substantially amorphous.

[0026]	For a thorough understanding of the present invention, reference is<br>
to be made to (he following detailed description, including the appended claims, in connection with the above-described drawings. It is understood that various omissions and substitutions of equivalents are contemplated as circumstances may suggest or render expedient, but these are intended to cover the application or implementation without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims of the present invention. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
[0027]	The terms, such as "first", second", "a", "an" herein do not denote<br>
a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item.<br>
[0028]	The present  invention provides a method  for preparing Nano<br>
crystalline particles. The method includes the steps of preparing a solution of organometallic compound in an organic solvent. Thereafter, the solution is hydrolyzed, neutralized and precipitated to form an organometallic hydroxide complex by using hydrolyzing agent. Thereafter, the organometallic hydroxide complex is rigorously stirred at a low temperature to form slurry of Nano crystalline particles. Thereafter, the slurry of Nano crystalline particles is dried.<br>
[0029]	As   mentioned   above,   the   solution   is   prepared   by   mixing<br>
organometallic compounds in the organic solvent. Generally, the organic solvent has a low boiling point, thereby evaporating easily. In an embodiment, the solution formed is a transparent sol-gel solution having uniformity at molecular level. Further, the sol-gel may be prepared by mixing 40 ml of Isopropyl Alcohol in a beaker containing 40 ml of Methanol at about temperature of 10-30°C (degree centigrade) and stirring on a magnetic<br><br>

stirrer. Further, the concentration of metal ions in the sol-gel solution may be adjusted to 1 -10% by weight, preferably 2- 5 % by weight.<br>
[0030]	Further, in an embodiment, the organometallic compound may be<br>
any other compound, such as organo-inorganics, metallo-organics, and the like. In another embodiment, the organometallic compound may be a Titanium Alkoxide. The Titanium Alkoxide compounds may be selected from the group consisting of Titanium (IV) isopropoxide. Titanium (IV) n-butoxide, Titanium (IV) methoxide, Titanium (IV) ethoxide, Titanium (IV) n-propoxide and other organometallic compounds of Titanium di oxide.<br>
[0031 ]	Thereafter, this solution is hydrolyzed. neutralized and precipitated<br>
to form organometallic hydroxide complex. In an embodiment, the solution is hydrolyzed by adding a controlled amount of water, preferably deionised and optionally acidified water, to the solution. Simultaneously, the solution is neutralized and precipitated by a suitable hydrolyzing agent such as Distilled Water, and/or Alkaline distilled water, or Acidic distilled water. In one embodiment, if desired the hydrolysis can be delayed by using acids such as HCI. HNO3 and the like. The solution is used as raw material for producing Nano particles of metal oxide. The hydrolyzed. neutralized and precipitated slurry is rinsed extensively with distilled water and rigorously stirred. In an embodiment the slurry is stirred at about a temperature ranging between 50°C-95°C to get slurry of Nano crystalline particles. In an embodiment, the Nano crystalline particles may be a metal oxide, such as Titanium di oxide [T1O2].<br>
[0032]	Further, the organometallic hydroxide complex may be rigorously<br>
stirred. In an embodiment, the organometallic hydroxide complex is stirred about a temperature below 100°C ranging in between 50 to 95C. The stirring process may be carried out by any conventional process of stirring known to a person skilled in the similar art.<br><br>
Inventor: Avinash R Moghe<br><br>
Complete Specification<br><br>
[0033]	further, the slurry of Nano crystalline particles is dried. Further,<br>
the slurry of the Nano particles may be dried by any method known to a person skilled in the pertained art.<br>

obtained having a uniform stoichiometric control over the composition of Nano crystalline particles. Further, due to the uniformity of molecules of the solution, each of the smallest elements of the obtained powder of Nano crystal has spherical shape.<br>
[0035]	The method for preparing the Nano particles of metal oxide<br>
according to the present invention may be widely and effectively applied for producing a multi-element nanocrystalline metal oxide, and in addition, the method could be applicable to a technology for forming a single element nanocrystalline metal oxide powder and the like.<br>
