				<td>Moulding compositions based on a thermoplastic polyester with improved flowabilitY<br>
This invention relates to moulding compositions based on a thermoplastic polyester and on at least one copolymer composed of at least one a-olefin with at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an aliphatic alcohol, the MFI (Melt Flow Index) of the copolymer being not less than 100 g/10 min, to a process for preparation of these moulding compositions, and also the use of these moulding compositions for production of mouldings for the electrical, electronics, telecommunications, motor vehicle or computer industry, in sports, in the household, in medicine or for the entertainment industry.<br>
Highly fiowable thermoplastic compositions are of interest for a wide variety of injection moulding applications. By way of example, thin-walled components in the electrical, electronics and motor vehicle industry require low viscosities from the thermoplastics composition in order to permit material to be charged to the mould with minimum injection pressures and, respectively, clamping forces in the appropriate injection moulding machines. This also applies to simultaneous charging of material to two or more injection moulding components by way of a shared runner system in what are known as multicavity tooling systems. Shorter cycle times can moreover often be achieved using low-viscosity thermoplastic compositions. Good flowabilities are also specifically very important for highly filled thermoplastic compositions, e.g. with glassfibre and/or mineral contents above 40% by weight.<br>
However, although the thermoplastic compositions have high fiowability, the actual components produced therefrom are subjected to stringent mechanical requirements, and the lowering of viscosity cannot therefore be permitted to impair mechanical properties.<br>
There are a number of ways of obtaining highly fiowable, low-viscosity thermoplastic moulding compositions.<br>
One way uses low-viscosity polymer resins with very low molecular weight as base polymers for the thermoplastic moulding compositions. However, the use of low-molecular-weight polymer resins is often associated with sacrifices in mechanical properties, in particular toughness. Preparation of a low-viscosity polymer resin in an existing polymerization plant moreover often requires complicated intervention attended by capital expenditure.<br>
Another way uses what are known as flow aids, also termed flow agents or flow assistants or internal lubricants, which can be added as an additive to the polymer resin.<br>
These flow aids are known from the literature, e.g. in Kunststoffe 2000, 90 (9), p. 116-118, and by way of example can be fatty acid esters of polyols, or amides derived from fatty acids and from<br><br>
amines. However, these fatty acid esters, such as pentaerythritol tetrastearate or ethylene glycol dimontanoate, have only limited miscibility with polar thermoplastics, such as polyamides, polyalkylene terephthalates or polycarbonates. Their concentration increases at the surface of the moulding and they are therefore also used as mould-release aids. Particularly at relatively high concentrations, they can also migrate out of these mouldings to the surface on heat-ageing and become concentrated at the surface. By way of example, in coated mouldings this can lead to problems with regard to adhesion to paint or to metal.<br>
As an alternative to the surface-active flow aids, it is possible to use internal flow aids which are compatible with the polymer resins. Examples of those suitable for this purpose are low-molecular-weight compounds or branched, highly branched or dendritic polymers whose polarity is similar to that of the polymer resin. These highly branched or dendritic systems are known from the literature and their basis can by way of example be branched polyesters, polyamides, polyesteramides, polyethers or polyamines, as described in Kunststoffe 2001, 91 (10), pp. 179-190, or in Advances in Polymer Science 1999,143 (Branched Polymers IT), pp. 1-34.<br>
EP 0682 057 Al describes the use of the nitrogen-containing first-generation 4-cascade dendrimer: 1,4-diaminobutane[4]propylamine (N,N' -tetrabis(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-butanediamine) DAB(PA)4 to lower viscosity in nylon-6, nylon-6,6 and polybutylene terephthalate. While use of DAB(PA)4 to lower viscosity in polyamides has practically no effect on the impact resistance of the resultant moulding compositions (difference 
WO-A 98 27159 describes an improvement in toughness of glassfibre-reinforced polyesters or polycarbonates via use of two copolymers composed of ethene and of acrylates, one copolymer also bearing a reactive epoxy or oxirane function. Flow improvement in the moulding compositions is an object of the invention, but the comparison system described composed of polyester and of the copolymer composed of ethene and methylacrylate has higher melt viscosity than the pure polyester system.<br>
JP 01247454 describes mixtures which have low-temperature toughness, of polyesters with a copolymer composed of ethene and of an unreactive alkyl acrylate whose MFI is 5.8 g / 10 min (at 190°C, 2.16 kg) and with a copolymer composed of ethene and of an acrylate having an additional reactive group. The subject of that application is not flow improvement in moulding compositions.<br>
EP-A 1 191 067 (= US 6 759 480) describes the impact modification of thermoplastics, inter alia of polyamide and polybutylene terephthalate via a mixture composed of a copolymer composed of ethene with an unreactive alkyl acrylate, and also of a copolymer composed of ethene with an<br><br>
acrylate having an additional reactive group. There is no discussion of the flowability of the moulding composition.<br>
EP-A 0 838 501 (= US 6 020 414) describes mixtures having low-temperature toughness of reinforcing materials and polyesters with a copolymer composed of ethene and of an unreactive alkyl acrylate, and also with a copolymer composed of ethene and of an acrylate having an additional reactive group. The best embodiment in that application is achieved with a copolymer composed of ethene and methyl acrylate. The subject of that application is not flow improvement in moulding compositions. .<br>
WO-A 2 001 038 437 (AU 4 610 801 A) describes mixtures composed of polyester with a core-shell rubber and with two different copolymers composed of ethene and of acrylates with and without additional reactive groups. The toughness of the moulding compositions can be improved, and the flowability even of the binary mixtures composed of polyester and of one of the other constituents mentioned is, according to Table 4 and Table 9, not better for the mixtures used than for the pure polyesters. The copolymer used composed of ethene and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate has an MFI value (MFI = Melt Flow Index) of 2 g/10 min (at 190°C, 2.16 kg).<br>
FR-A 28 19 821 describes the use of copolymers composed of ethene with 2-ethylhexyl acrylate whose MFI is smaller than 100 as a constituent of hot-melt adhesive mixtures. There are no indications of applications for elastomer modification or flow improvement of semicrystalline thermoplastics.<br>
The object of the present invention then consisted in lowering the viscosity of polycondensate compositions based on thermoplastic polyesters by treating the polymer melt with additives, without any resultant need to accept the losses that occur when using low-viscosity linear polymer resins or when using additives disclosed in the literature in properties such as impact resistance, tensile strain at break and hydrolysis resistance. In terms of stiffness and ultimate tensile strength, the compositions based on thermoplastic polyesters should if at all possible not differ significantly from the polycondensate compositions based on thermoplastic polyesters and not treated with additives, in order to permit problem-free replacement of the materials for plastics structures based on thermoplastic polyesters.<br>
Achievement of the object is provided by thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising<br>
A) from 99.9 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 99.5 to 30 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 99.0 to 55 parts by weight, of at least one thermoplastic polyester, preferably of a polyalkylene terephthalate and<br><br>
B) from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.25 to 15 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 1.0 to 10 parts by weight, of at least one copolymer composed of at least one olefin, preferably one a-olefin and of at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an aliphatic alcohol, preferably of an aliphatic alcohol having from 5 to 30 carbon atoms, the MFI (Melt Flow Index) of the copolymer B) being not less than 100 g/10 min, preferably not less than 150 g/10 min,<br>
which are therefore provided by the present invention.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, measurement or determination of the MFI (Melt Flow Index) always took place at 190°C with a test load of 2.16 kg.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that mixtures of thermoplastic polyesters and of a copolymer of o-olefins with methacrylic esters or with acrylic esters of aliphatic alcohols whose MFI is not less than 100 g/10 min lead to the desired lowering of the melt viscosity of the inventive moulding compositions prepared therefrom, and that these inventive moulding compositions, when compared with moulding compositions without copolymer, exhibit no sacrifices - but rather indeed generally marked improvements - in properties such as impact resistance, tensile strain at break and hydrolysis resistance. The moulding compositions have excellent suitability for use in thin-wall technology.<br>
According to the invention, the thermoplastic moulding compositions comprise, as component A), at least one thermoplastic polyester, preferably semiaromatic polyesters.<br>
The thermoplastic, preferably semiaromatic, polyesters to be used according to the invention as component A) have been selected from the group of the polyalkylene terephthalates, preferably selected from the group of the polyethylene terephthalates, of the polytrimethylene terephthalates and of the polybutylene terephthalates, particularly preferably of the polybutylene terephthalates and polyethylene terephthalates, very particularly preferably of polybutylene terephthalate.<br>
Semiaromatic polyesters are materials whose molecules contain not only aromatic moieties but also aliphatic moieties.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, polyalkylene terephthalates are reaction products derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids or from their reactive derivatives (e.g. dimethyl esters or anhydrides) and aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or araliphatic diols or are mixtures of these reaction products.<br>
Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can be prepared from terephthalic acid (or from its reactive derivatives) and from aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diols having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, by known<br><br>
methods (Kunststoff-Handbuch [Plastics Handbook], Vol. Vffl, pp. 695 et seq., Karl-Hanser-Verlag, Munich 1973).<br>
Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates contain at least 80 mol%, preferably 90 mol%, based on the dicarboxylic acid, of terephthalic acid radicals and at least 80 mol%, preferably at least 90 mol%, based on the diol component, of ethylene glycol radicals and/or 1,3-propanediol radicals and/or 1,4-butanediol radicals.<br>
The preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can contain, alongside terephthalic acid radicals, up to 20 mol% of radicals of other aromatic dicarboxylic acids having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms or radicals of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. radicals of phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, cyclohexanediacetic acid, cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid.<br>
The preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can contain, alongside ethylene radicals and, respectively, 1,3-propanediol radicals and, respectively, 1,4-butanediol radicals, up to 20 mol% of other aliphatic diols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms or of cycloaliphatic diols having from 6 to 21 carbon atoms, e.g. radicals of 1,3-propanediol, 2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane-l,4-dimethanol, 3-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol and 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,6-pentanediol, 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol, 2,2-diethyl-1,3-propanediol, 2,5-hexanediol, l,4-di(p-hydroxyethoxy)benzene, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)propane, 2,4-dihydroxy-l,l,3,3-tetramethylcyclobutane, 2,2-bis(3-(3-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)propane and 2,2-bis(4-hydroxypropoxyphenyl)propane (DE-A 24 07 674 (= US 4 035 958), DE-A 24 07 776, DE-A 27 15 932 (= US 4 176 224)).<br>
The polyalkylene terephthalates can be branched via incorporation of relatively small amounts of tri- or tetrahydric alcohols or of tri- or tetrabasic carboxylic acid, as described by way of example in DE-A 19 00 270 (= US-A 3 692 744). Examples of preferred branching agents are trimesic acid, trimellitic acid, trimethylolethane and trimethylolpropane and pentaerytnritol.<br>
It is advisable not to use more than 1 mol% of the branching agent, based on the acid component.<br>
Particular preference is given to polyalkylene terephthalates prepared solely from terephthalic acid and from its reactive derivatives (e.g. dialkyl esters thereof) and ethylene glycol and/or 1,3-propanediol and/or 1,4-butanediol (polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate), and mixtures of these polyalkylene terephthalates.<br>
Other preferred polyalkylene terephthalates are copolyesters prepared from at least two of the<br><br>
abovementioned acid components and/or from at least two of the abovementioned alcohol components, particularly preferred copolyesters being poly(ethylene glycol/1,4-butanediol) terephthalates.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the polyalkylene terephthalates is generally from about 0.3 cm3/g to 1.5cm3/g, preferably from 0.4 cm3/g to 1.3 cm3/g, particularly preferably from 0.5 cm3/g to 1.0cm3/g, in each case measured in phenol/o-dichlorobenzene (1:1 parts by weight) at 25°C.<br>
The thermoplastic polyesters to be used according to the invention can also be used in a mixture with other polyesters and/or with other polymers.<br>
Conventional additives, e.g. mould-release agents, stabilizers and/or flow aids can be admixed in the melt with the polyesters to be used according to the invention, or can be applied to their surface.<br>
The inventive compositions comprise, as component B), copolymers, preferably random copolymers composed of at least one olefin, preferably an a-olefin and of at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an aliphatic alcohol, the MFI of the copolymer B) being not less than 100 g/10 min, preferably not less than 150 g/10 min, particularly preferably not less than 300 g/10 min. In one preferred embodiment, less than 4% by weight, particularly preferably less than 1.5% .by weight and very particularly preferably 0% by weight of the copolymer B) is composed of monomer units which contain further reactive functional groups (selected from the group consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines).<br>
Suitable olefins, preferably o-olefins as constituent of the copolymers B) preferably have from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and can be unsubstituted or have substitution by one or more aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic groups.<br>
Preferred olefins have been selected from the group consisting of ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 3-methyl-1-pentene. Particularly preferred olefins are ethene and propene, and ethene is very particularly preferred.<br>
Mixtures of the olefins described are also suitable.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the further reactive functional groups (selected from the group consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines) of the copolymer B) are introduced exclusively by way of the olefins into the copolymer B).<br>
The content of the olefin in the copolymer B) is from 50 to 90% by weight, preferably from 55 to 75% by weight.<br><br>
The copolymer B) is further defined via the second constituent alongside the olefin. A suitable second constituent is alkyl or arylalkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid whose alkyl or arylalkyl group is formed by from 5 to 30 carbon atoms. This alkyl or arylalkyl group can be linear or branched, and can also contain cycloaliphatic or aromatic groups, and alongside this may also have substitution by one or more ether or thioether functions. Other suitable methacrylic or acrylic esters in this connection are those synthesized from an alcohol component which are based on oligoethylene glycol or oligopropylene glycol having only one hydroxy group and at most 30 carbon atoms.<br>
By way of example, the alkyl or arylalkyl group of the methacrylic or acrylic ester can have been selected from the group consisting of 1-pentyl, 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 1-heptyl, 3-heptyl, 1-octyl, l-(2-ethyl)hexyl, 1-nonyl, 1-decyl, 1-dodecyl, 1-lauryl or 1-octadecyl. Alkyl or arylalkyl groups having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms are preferred. Particular preference is also given to branched alkyl groups which, in comparison with linear alkyl groups having the same number of carbon atoms, lead to a lower glass transition temperature TG.<br>
According to the invention, particular preference is given to copolymers B) in which the olefin is copolymerized with 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. Mixtures of the acrylic or methacrylic esters described are also suitable.<br>
It is preferable here to use more than 60% by weight, particularly preferably more than 90% by weight and very particularly preferably 100% by weight, of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, based on the total amount of acrylic and methacrylic ester in copolymer B).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the further reactive functional groups (selected from the group consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines) of the copolymer B) are introduced exclusively by way of acrylic or methacrylic ester into the copolymer B).<br>
The content of the acrylic or methacrylic esters in the copolymer B) is from 10 to 50% by weight, preferably from 25 to 45% by weight.<br>
A feature of suitable copolymers B) is not only their constitution but also their low molecular weight. Accordingly, copolymers B) suitable for the inventive moulding compositions are only those whose MFI value, measured at 190°C and with a load of 2.16 kg, is at least 100 g/10 min, preferably at least 150 g/10 min, particularly preferably at least 300 g/10 min.<br>
Examples of suitable copolymers of component B) can have been selected from the group of the materials supplied by Atofina with the trade mark Lotryl® EH, this usually being used as hot-melt<br><br>
adhesive.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the inventive thermoplastic moulding compositions can comprise, in addition to components A) and B), one or more components from the series C), D), E), F) or G). '<br>
In one preferred embodiment of this type, the thermoplastic moulding compositions can also comprise, in addition to components A) and B),<br>
C)        from 0.001 to 70 parts by weight, preferably from 5 to 50 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 9 to 47 parts by weight, of a filler and/or reinforcing material.<br>
However, the material can also comprise a mixture composed of two or more different fillers and/or reinforcing materials, for example based on talc, mica, silicate, quartz, titanium dioxide, wollastonite, kaolin, amorphous silicas, magnesium carbonate, chalk, feldspar, barium sulphate, glass beads and/or fibrous fillers and/or reinforcing materials based on carbon fibres and/or glassfibres. It is preferable to use mineral particulate fillers based on talc, mica, silicate, quartz, titanium dioxide, wollastonite, kaolin, amorphous silicas, magnesium carbonate, chalk, feldspar, barium sulphate and/or glassfibres. According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to use mineral particulate fillers based on talc, wollastonite, kaolin and/or glassfibres.<br>
Particularly for applications which demand isotropy in dimensional stability and demand high thermal dimensional stability, for example in motor vehicle applications for exterior bodywork parts, it is preferable to use mineral fillers, in particular talc, wollastonite or kaolin.<br>
A further particular preference is also the use of acicular mineral fillers as component C). According to the invention, acicular mineral fillers are a mineral filler with pronounced acicular character. An example which may be mentioned is acicular wollastonites. The length : diameter ratio of the material is preferably from 2:1 to 35:1, particularly preferably from 3:1 to 19:1, most preferably from 4:1 to 12:1. The average particle size of the inventive acicular minerals is preferably smaller than 20 um, particularly preferably smaller than 15 urn, with particular preference smaller than 10 um, determined using a CILAS GRANULOMETER.<br>
As previously described above, the filler and/or reinforcing material may, if appropriate, have been surface-modified, for example using a coupling agent or coupling agent system, e.g. based on silane. However, the pretreatment is not essential. In particular when glassfibres are used, polymer dispersions, film-formers, branching agents and/or glassfibre processing aids can also be used in addition to silanes.<br>
The glassfibres to be used with particular preference according to the invention whose fibre diameter is generally from 7 to 18 um, preferably from 9 to 15 um, are added in the form of<br><br>
continuous-filament fibres or in the form of chopped or ground glassfibres. The fibres can have been equipped with a suitable size system and with a coupling agent or coupling agent system, e.g. based on silane.<br>
Familiar coupling agents based on silane for pretreatment are silane compounds having by way of example the general formula (I)<br>
where the substituents are as follows:<br>
q:         a whole number from 2 to 10, preferably from 3 to 4, r:         a whole number from 1 to 5, preferably from 1 to 2, k:         a whole number from 1 to 3, preferably 1.<br>
Preferred coupling agents are silane compounds from the group of aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, arninobutyltrimethoxysilane, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aminobutylrriethoxysilane, and also the corresponding silanes which contain a glycidyl group as substituent X.<br>
The amounts generally used of the silane compounds for surface coating of the fillers are from 0.05 to 2% by weight, preferably from 0.25 to 1.5% by weight and in particular from 0.5 to 1% by weight, based on the mineral filler.<br>
The consequence of processing to give the moulding composition or moulding is that the d97 or d50 value of the particulate fillers in the moulding composition or in the moulding can be smaller than that of the fillers initially used. A consequence of the processing to give the moulding composition or moulding is that the length distributions of the glassfibres in the moulding composition or in the moulding can be shorter than those of the material initially used.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic moulding compositions can also comprise, in addition to components A) and B) and/or C)<br>
D)        from 0.001 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 9 to 35 parts by weight, of at least one flame retardant.<br>
Flame retardants that can be used in component D) are commercially available organic halogen compounds with synergists or are commercially available organic nitrogen compounds or are<br><br>
organic/inorganic phosphorus compounds individually or in a mixture. It is also possible to use mineral flame retardant additives such as magnesium hydroxide or Ca Mg carbonate hydrates (e.g. DE-A 4 236 122 (= CA 2 109 024 Al)).

Polycarbonates can be prepared by known processes. Examples of suitable processes for preparation of polycarbonates are preparation from bisphenols using phosgene by the interfacial process or from bisphenols using phosgene by the homogeneous-phase process known as the pyridine process, or from bisphenols using carbonic esters by the melt transesterification process. These preparation processes are described by way of example in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, Volume 9, pp. 31-76, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964.<br>
In the preparation of polycarbonate, it is preferable to use raw materials and auxiliaries with a very low level of contaminants. In particular in preparation by the melt transesterification process, the intention is that the bisphenols used and the carbonic acid derivatives used have minimal content of alkali metal ions and alkaline earth metal ions. These pure raw materials are obtainable by way of example by recrystallizing, washing or distilling the carbonic acid derivatives, e.g. carbonic esters, and the bisphenols.<br>

Their weight-average molar mass is particularly preferably from 12 000 to 80 000 g/mol, with particular preference from 20 000 to 35 000 g/mol.<br>
By way of example, it is possible to adjust the average molar mass of the inventive polycarbonates in a known manner via an appropriate amount of chain terminators. The chain terminators may be used individually or in the form of a mixture of various chain terminators.<br>

Preferred branching agents are l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane and 3,3-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole.<br>
The amount of any branching agents to be used is preferably from 0.05 mol% to 2 mol%, based on the molar amount of bisphenols used.<br>
By way of example, if the polycarbonate is prepared by the interfacial process, the branching agents can be used as an initial charge with the bisphenols and the chain terminators in the aqueous alkaline phase, or can be added dissolved in an organic solvent together with the carbonic acid derivatives. In the case of the transesteriflcation process, the branching agents are preferably metered in together with the dihydroxyaromatics or bisphenols.<br>
Preferred catalysts to be used during the preparation of polycarbonate by the melt transesteriflcation process are the phosphonium salts and ammonium salts known from the literature.<br>

By way of example, preferred polydiorganosiloxane-polycarbonate block copolymers can be prepared by reacting polydiorganosiloxanes containing a,co-bishydroxyaryloxy end groups together with other bisphenols, if appropriate with concomitant use of branching agents in the conventional amounts, e.g. by the interfacial process (as described by way of example in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, Volume 9, pp. 31-76, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964). The polydiorganosiloxanes containing a,0)-bishydroxyaryloxy end groups and used as starting materials for this synthesis, and their preparation, are prior art and are described by way of example in US-A 3 419 634.<br>

According to the invention, the following combinations of the components are preferred<br>
However, the present invention also provides a process for preparation of the inventive thermoplastic moulding compositions. This takes place by known processes via mixing of the<br><br>
components. The mixing of the components takes place via mixing of the appropriate proportions by weight of the components. The mixing of the components preferably takes place at temperatures of from 220 to 330°C via combining, mixing, kneading, extruding or rolling of the components together. It can be advantageous to premix individual components. It can moreover be advantageous to produce mouldings or semifinished products directly from a physical mixture (dry blend) prepared at room temperature (preferably from 0 to 40°C) and composed of premixed components and/or of individual components.<br>
The invention further provides the mouldings to be produced from the inventive moulding compositions comprising<br>
A)	from 99.9 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 99.5 to 30 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 99.0 to 55 parts by weight, of at least one thermoplastic polyester,<br>
preferably of a polyalkylene terephthalate and<br>
B)	from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.25 to 15 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 1.0 to 10 parts by weight, of at least one copolymer composed of at least<br>
one olefin, preferably cc-olefin and of at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an<br>
aliphatic alcohol, preferably of an aliphatic alcohol having from 5 to 30 carbon atoms, the<br>
MFI (measured at  190°C for 2.16kg) of the copolymer B) being not less than<br>
100 g/10 min, preferably not less than 150 g/10 min.<br>
A feature of the inventive mouldings produced from the compositions which are used according to the invention and which are based on thermoplastic polyesters is higher impact resistance than mouldings produced from moulding compositions which have comparable viscosity and which have been prepared via use of a lower-viscosity base resin as component A). The tensile strain at break of the moulding compositions to be used according to the invention here is also often higher in comparison with the identical-viscosity moulding compositions based on a lower-viscosity base resin, while the tensile modulus is only very slightly reduced in the inventive mouldings, and materials replacement is therefore possible.<br>
The following further advantages are exhibited by the inventive moulding compositions both in comparison with the moulding compositions based on identical-viscosity base resin (component A) and also in comparison with the identical-viscosity moulding compositions based on a low-viscosity base resin (component A):<br>
lower density;<br>
often more isotropic shrinkage behaviour, leading to less warpage of the mouldings;<br><br>
reduced level of shrinkage, leading to reduced warpage of the mouldings; improved hydrolysis resistance; improved surface quality of the mouldings.<br>
The inventive moulding compositions exhibit markedly improved flowability, in particular at the shear rates relevant for thermoplastics processing. This is also apparent, inter alia, from markedly reduced injection pressures.<br>
The inventive moulding compositions can be processed by conventional processes, for example via injection moulding or extrusion, to give mouldings or semifinished products. Examples of semifinished products are foils and sheets. Processing by injection moulding is particularly preferred.<br>
The mouldings or semifinished products to be produced according to the invention from the thermoplastic moulding compositions can be small or large parts and by way of example can be used in the motor vehicle, electrical, electronics, telecommunications, information technology, or computer industry, in the household, in sports, in medicine, or in the entertainment industry. In the motor vehicle industry, the mouldings to be produced according to the invention can be incorporated into the cooling circulation system and/or into the oil circulation system of motor vehicles. In particular, the inventive moulding compositions can be used for applications which require high melt flowability. An example of these applications is what is known as thin-wall<br>
.      .     *.<br>
technology, in which the wall thicknesses of mouldings to be produced from the moulding compositions are less than 2.5 mm, preferably less than 2.0 mm, particularly preferably less than 1.5 mm and most preferably less than 1.0 mm. Another example of these applications is cycle time reduction, for example via a reduction in processing temperature. Another application example is the processing of the moulding compositions by way of what are known as multitooling systems, in which material is charged by way of a runner system to at least 4 moulds, preferably at least 8 moulds, particularly preferably at least 12 moulds, most preferably at least 16 moulds, in an injection moulding procedure.<br><br>

The nature and amount of each of the further additives (component G) used are the same for corresponding comparative examples and inventive examples, specifically using G = 0.5%, G = 1.7%, G = 3.4% and, respectively, G = 1.85 %.<br>
Compositions based on PBT for the examples in Tables 1-4 were compounded in a ZSK32 (Werner and Pfleiderer) twin-screw extruder at melt temperatures of from 260 to 300°C to give moulding compositions, and the melt was discharged into a water bath and then pelletized.<br>
The test specimens for the tests listed in Tables 1-4 were injection moulded in an Arburg 320-210-500 injection moulding machine at a melt temperature of about 260°C and at a mould temperature ofabout80°C:<br>
-	dumbbell specimens (thickness 3 mm to ISO 527)<br>
-	80 x 10 x 4 mm test specimens (to ISO 178)<br>
-	standard test specimens for the UL 94 V test<br>
-	test specimens for the glow-wire test to DIN EN 60695-2-13<br>
-	60 x 60 x 2 mm plaques for shrinkage measurement to ISO 294-4<br>
With the exception of the melt viscosity measurements and the measurements of melt indices, all of the tests listed in the tables below were carried out on the abovementioned test specimens.<br>
Tensile modulus of elasticity: Stifmess to DIN / EN / ISO 527-2/1 A.<br>
Tensile strength to DIN / EN / ISO 527-2/1 A.<br>
Tensile strain at break: Extensibility determined to DIN/EN/ISO 527-2/1 A.<br>
Flexural modulus to DIN / EN / ISO 178<br>
Flexural strength to DIN / EN / ISO 178<br><br>
Outer fibre strain: Extensibility to DIN / EN / ISO 178<br>
Impact resistance: IZOD method to ISO 180 1U at room temperature<br>
Injection pressure: Recording of the pressure needed to injection mould the respective test specimens on the injection moulding machine<br>
UL 94 V combustibility: to UL 94<br>
GWTT: Determination of glow-wire ignition temperature to DIN EN 60695-2-13<br>
Shrinkage: To determine shrinkage properties, standardized sheets of dimension 60 mm x 60 mm x 2 mm (ISO 294-4) are injection moulded. Longitudinal and transverse shrinkage is determined both in terms of moulding shrinkage and in terms of after-shrinkage, via subsequent measurement.<br>
Moulding shrinkage and after-shrinkage together give the total shrinkage.<br>
Density: Determination by the flotation method on test specimens to DIN EN ISO 1183-1.<br>
Melt viscosity: Determined to DIN 54811 / ISO 11443 at the stated shear rate and temperature, using Viscorobo 94.00 equipment from GSttfert after drying of the pellets at 120°C for 4 hours in a vacuum dryer.<br>
Melt index MVR (melt volume flow rate): Determined to DIN EN ISO 1133 with the stated force and temperature after drying of the pellets at 120 °C for 4 hours in a vacuum dryer.<br>
Hydrolysis:<br>
To measure hydrolysis resistance, test specimens produced from the inventive moulding compositions were stored at 100°C and 100% humidity in a steam sterilizer. After a number of days of hydrolysis (see Table 1), outer fibre strain at maximum flexural stress was measured to DIN EN ISO 178 and IZOD impact resistance was measured to ISO 180/1U.<br>
Surface: Test specimens of dimension 60 mm x 60 mm x 2 mm were used for surface appraisal and visual surface assessment. Decisive criteria for judgement were gloss, smoothness, colour and uniform surface structure.<br><br>
