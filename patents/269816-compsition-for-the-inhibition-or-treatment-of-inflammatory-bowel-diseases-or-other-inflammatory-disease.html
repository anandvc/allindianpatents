				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF<br>
TREATMENT FOR INFLAMMATORY DISEASES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are<br>
complex diseases that are thought to result from over activation of the immune system directed<br>
at luminal antigens of the gastrointestinal tract (12). In the early 1940's it was observed that<br>
sulfasalazine, formed by the chemical union of the antibiotic sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic<br>
acid (5-ASA; also referred to as mesalamine) by an azo bond, had a beneficial effect in patients<br>
with colitis (29). Subsequent clinical studies over the next two decades established that<br>
sulfasalazine had efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (30, 31). Additional<br>
studies were directed to determine the chemical kinetics of sulfasalazine when administered<br>
orally and to determine mechanisms of action (32-34). Approximate 75% of sulfasalazine<br>
reaches the colon unchanged. Within the colon the azo bond is split by bacterial enzyme action<br>
into metabolites, 5-ASA and sulfapyridine. Following azo bond reduction, most of the<br>
sulfapyridine is absorbed from the colon whereas only 20% of 5-ASA is absorbed. The majority<br>
of 5-ASA remains in the colon and is recovered in the feces primarily as free 5-ASA.<br>
[0002] Postulated mechanisms for th'e presumed beneficial action of sulfasalazine in the<br>
treatment of colitis initially included inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and inhibition of the<br>
lipoxygenase pathway in inflammatory cells such as neutrophils (35,36). Ensuing investigations<br>
have established additional therapeutic mechanisms whereby 5-ASA promotes healing and<br>
reduces inflammation in IBD (2, 37, 38). These include: free radical scavengers, inhibit T-cell<br>
proliferation, inhibit presentation of antigen to T-cells, inhibit adhesion of macrophages and<br>
granulocytes, decrease production of interleukins (ILs) and down regulation of the transcription<br>
'factor, NF-kB, activity. Despite the utility of sulfasalazine for patients with inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, experience has shown that up to one third of patients cannot tolerate this medication<br>
and manifest one or more side effects of variable severity. These side effects are related<br>
directly to systemic absorption of sulfapyridine. Because of sulfasalazine-related side effects,<br>
investigators have examined 5-ASA as a single agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel<br>
disease. There have been several formulations of 5-ASA designed to inhibit proximal intestinal<br>
absorption and delivery of this compound to areas of active inflammation (39). Several<br>
formulations of 5-ASA have been studied and those currently most popular include coated<br>
forms of 5-ASA that are released in a pH-sensitive manner to the distal ileum and colon.<br>
Examples of such agents include Asacol™ (Proctor and Gamble) and Pentasa™ (Shire US inc.).<br>
Furthermore, 5-ASA preparation for rectal delivery has included the development of<br>
suppositories and enemas containing 5-ASA as the active agent. Examples include Rowasa™<br>
rectal suspension enema (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) and 5-ASA suppositories such as Canasa™<br>
(Axcan Scandiapharm). Thus, a number of oral or rectally delivered 5-ASA agents are<br>
presently available for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
[0003] Recent investigations into the etiological triad of genetic: environmental: immune factors<br>
have expanded our knowledge of these individual components and their potential interactions.<br>
Pathogenetic models of IBD envision initiating events, possible microbiologicals, arising from<br>
the gut lumen that converts immune tolerance to a sustained hyperactive state with elaboration<br>
and amplification of cellular and humoral mediators. Immunocyte derived injurious and<br>
proinflammatory substances cause tissue injury and destruction. These substances include<br>
prostaglandins, reactive oxygen metabolites, nitric oxide, leukotrienes, proteases and matrix<br>
metalloproteinases (3). The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) have<br>
been examined in experimental models of IBD (4,5). Pharmacological and genetic manipulation<br>
of oxygen free radical and NO generation have been shown to ameliorate experimental colitis<br>
induced by luminal administered trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate<br>
sodium (DSS) (5-10).<br>
[0004] Although several experimental strategies have been employed that suggest the<br>
importance of enhanced production of superoxide and nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of IBD,<br>
inconsistent results have the issue unresolved. For example, the beneficial effect of superoxide<br>
dismutase (SOD) treatment in experimental models of colitis has been reported while SOD<br>
treatment in humans with IBD has shown limited benefit (40). Similarly, the inhibitors of<br>
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) have yielded mixed results in various experimental<br>
models of IBD (6-8, 27). The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAG) and phenyl N-tertbutylnitrone<br>
(PEN) when used alone have been shown to be effective in protection against<br>
TNBS-induced colitis in rat (9) and DSS-induced colitis in mice, (10) respectfully. Furthermore,<br>
recent studies suggest a dominant role of iNOS-derived NO in a murine model of colitis (5).<br>
Antioxidant therapy has also been shown to suppress colonic iNOS activity and to decrease<br>
colonic NF-KB DNA-binding activity in experimental animals (10). Nuclear factor-KB, NF-KB is<br>
a family of transcription factors known to regulate a variety of genes controlling the<br>
inflammatory process and regulating programmed cell death (41).<br>
[0005] Thus, there exists extensive experimental support for the notion that reactive oxygen<br>
molecules and nitric oxide may contribute to the pathogenesis of mucosal injury in inflammatory<br>
bowel disease. Furthermore, experimental evidence also provides support for the concept that<br>
inhibition of nitric oxide species and NO generation exert favorable effects on mucosal healing<br>
and the inflammatory process in several well-defined models of chemically induced colitis.<br>
However, there continues to be a need in the field for a more effective treatment of<br>
inflammatory bowel diseases and other conditions related to inflammation. It is to this need that<br>
the present invention is directed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006] Figure 1: Experimental Design: Colitis was induced at day 0 by rectal administration<br>
of TNBS. Three days after TNBS dosing rats received daily intraluminal therapy per rectum for<br>
either 5 or 8 days. Four treatment protocols were employed and included: (A) 5-ASA<br>
(100mg/kg), (B) NAC (40mM), (C) a combination of 5-ASA (100mg/kg) and MAC (40mM),and<br>
(D) a saline control.<br>
[0007] Figure 2: Macroscopic grading of inflammation and injury 8 days after intracolonic<br>
administration of TNBS. Macroscopic grading (0-6) 8 days after TNBS revealed moderately<br>
severe inflammation and ulceration: score 4.5 ± 0.5. Therapy with the NAC/5-ASA combination<br>
for 5d was the only intervention that significantly reduced macroscopic injury: score 2-6 ± 0.7;<br>
These results are representative of 4 different experiments done at different times with 5<br>
animals per group per each experiment. * denotes p

reduced significantly the aggregate microscopic injury score by 75%. Therapy was initiated 3<br>
days after induction of colitis by TNBS. Furthermore, single agent therapy with 5-ASA alone and<br>
NAC alone also significantly decreased histological measures of injury by 46 and 53%,<br>
respectively. The degree of histologic healing with the NAC/5-ASA combination was significantly<br>
greater than that observed with either 5-ASA or NAC alone.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] The present invention contemplates use of 5-ASA (mesalamine) plus an antioxidant<br>
either together as separate molecular entities or when coupled chemically, to provide an<br>
enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect against inflammatory bowel diseases in mammals.<br>
The combination of mesalamine plus an antioxidant in a mammal model of colitis promotes<br>
healing and reduces inflammation to a significantly greater degree than either agent when used<br>
alone. The present invention provides an improved anti-inflammatory effectiveness of 5-ASA<br>
for use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease by the addition of an antioxidant. Use<br>
of the presently claimed compositions result in a reduction in the need for additional antiinflammatory<br>
agents, such as prednisone and Imuran in the treatment of inflammatory disease<br>
(thereby providing a significant cost benefit and reduction in drug-induced toxicity.).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can serve as a model for additional pharmacological<br>
approaches to other inflammatory and, possibly, neoplastic conditions within the gastrointestinal<br>
tract.<br>
[0013] As shown below experiments were performed to examine the ability of an antioxidant<br>
(NAC) and 5-ASA, when administered separately or in combination to the distal colon, to affect<br>
mucosal healing and repair following colitis chemically-induced by TNBS or DSS.<br>
[0014] MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
[0015] Experimental Animals<br>
[0016] Male Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 grams) were housed in cages containing contact<br>
bedding. Rats were deprived of food for 24 hrs prior to the induction of colitis, but were allowed<br>
free access to water throughout the experiment. Institutional approval for experimental<br>
protocols was provided by the research and animal care committees of the research services<br>
at the Oklahoma City Veterans Administration Medical Center.<br>
[0017] Induction of colitis by TNBS treatment<br>
[0018] Following a 24 hr fast, rats were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane followed by<br>
insertion of a polyethylene catheter into the anus. The tip of the catheter was advanced 8 cm<br>
proximal from the anus and a single dose of TNBS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), dissolved in 50%<br>
ethanol, was injected through the cannula (15 mg dissolved in a 0.6 ml volume of 50% ethanol)<br>
to induce colitis. Following the administration of TNBS the animals were maintained in a headdown<br>
position for approximately 60 seconds to prevent leakage of the infusate. After 72 hrs,<br>
rats dosed initially with TNBS were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups to<br>
receive daily intracolonic therapy in a manner similar to that used for TNJBS administration. The<br>
groups were: A.) 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA) (100 mg/kg) B.) Nl-acetylcysteine (MAC) (40<br>
mM) plus 5-ASA (100 mg/kg) C.) NAC (40mM).orD.) saline. An additional group of rats (Group<br>
E) served as control and received saline per rectum on day 0 and at subsequent intervals that<br>
corresponded to treatment protocols. Rats were treated for either 5 or 8 days and then<br>
sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Figure 1 illustrates the design of these experiments.<br>
[0019] Induction of colitis by DSS treatment<br>
[0020] Colitis was induced by oral administration of a 4% solution of DSS (dextran sulfate<br>
sodium) in drinking water for 4 days. Experimental groups were randomized to include group<br>
1 control, group 2-5 received DSS in drinking water and groups 3-5 were further randomized<br>
to receive daily intracolonic treatment with 5-ASA (1 OOmg/kg) plus NAC (40mM), group 3; 5-<br>
ASA alone, group 4; and NAC constituted group 5. Animals received treatment for 4 days.<br>
Macroscopic indices of colonic injury were scored and tabulated. Histological features that were<br>
examined included epithelial damage and mucosal ulceration. Additional measures included<br>
determination of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and cytokine gene expression in colonic<br>
tissues performed by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA).<br>
[0021] Macroscopic assessment of colitis<br>
[0022] Upon sacrifice, the distal 8 cm of the colon was removed, opened by a longitudinal<br>
incision and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline to remove fecal material. Macroscopic<br>
assessment of colitis was carried out by an independent observer who was unaware of the<br>
treatment groups. The criterial and scale of grading are listed in Table 1. Inflammation was<br>
present if the mucosa was erythematous. Ulceration of the mucosa was defined as a distinct<br>
break or interruption of the mucosa. Once macroscopic damage was assessed full thickness<br>
colonic tissue samples were taken from the inflamed areas and either processed for histology<br>
or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent cytokine measurement and determination of<br>
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.<br>
 [0023] Histological assessment of colitis<br>
[0024] Colonic tissue samples taken from the initial segment were immersed in 10% phosphate<br>
buffered formalin and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections of 3 micron thickness were<br>
cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The slides were then evaluated by a pathologist<br>
for epithelial damage, architectural changes, mononuclear infiltration, polymorphonuclear<br>
leukocyte (PMN) infiltration and ulceration. The individual microscopic features of colitis were<br>
graded according to criteria noted in Table 2. In addition to scoring individual features of colitis,<br>
an aggregate score of colitis was tabulated by adding together individual scores, th us, providing<br>
a global assessment of colitis.<br>
(Table Removed)  [0026] Myeloperoxidase activity<br>
[0027] Myeloperoxidase activity was used as an indirect measure of the severity of colon!c<br>
inflammation by PMNs. Whole thickness tissues taken following macroscopic assessment were<br>
weighed (100mg) and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80°C. The<br>
tissues were then removed from storage at -80°C and allowed to thaw on ice. Once thawed,<br>
1 ml of hexadecyltrimethylamonium bromide (HTAB) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) containing 50mM<br>
KH2P04 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 0.1 M Na2HPO4 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added per 10O<br>
mg tissue for homogenization. Homogenates then underwent a series of four freeze/thaw<br>
cycles before finally being centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant<br>
was collected for measurement of MPO activity. Horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis,<br>
MO) was used as a standard; stock solution of 0.5 mg/ml. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma,<br>
St. Louis, MO) was used as the substrate for carrying out the reaction. At the time of assay 25<br>
ul of standard and sample were added to appropriately labeled tubes. TMB was added at a<br>
volume of 250 ul to initiate the reaction and 0.1 M H2S04 (250 ul) was added after 10 minutes<br>
to terminate the reaction. The absorbance changes were read at 450 nm and recorded.<br>
Results were expressed as ng/ml/g of tissue.<br>
[0028] Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)<br>
[0029] Following the manufacturer's protocol, 1 ml of TRI Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) is<br>
used per 100mg of tissue. The frozen tissue is placed into the TRI Reagent and immediately<br>
homogenized using a tissue macerator. The homogenates are transferred to microcentrifuge<br>
tubes and 0.2ml of chloroform is added per ml of TRI Reagent used. The samples are shaken<br>
thoroughly and allowed to sit at room temp for 3 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 12000-x<br>
g for 15 min at 4°C, After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new<br>
tube and 9.5ml of 2-propanol is added to precipitate the RNA. After sitting at room temp for<br>
10min. the samples are centrifuged at 12000 x g for 15min. The supematants are discarded<br>
and the pellets are washed in 70% ethanol followed by centrifugation at 12000-x g for 5 rnin.<br>
The ethanol was removed and the pellets are dissolved in 50ul of DEPC treated water per<br>
sample. Quantitation is performed by spectrophotometry at 260nm and 280nm.<br>
[0030] RPA analysis was performed with RiboQuant™ multi-probe RNase protection assay<br>
system (BD Biosciences-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). To 20ug of total RNA in 8ul of<br>
hybridization buffer and 2ul of 32P-labeled in vitro transcribed RNA probes were added. The<br>
probes were transcribed from the multiprobe template set rCK-1 which as a panel of probes<br>
against IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-3, IL-5, IL-10, IL-2,TNFa, TNB|3, GAPDH genes. Probes were prepared<br>
according to the manufactures protocol. The RNA samples containing labeled probes were<br>
incubated briefly at 90°C, slowly cooled to 56°C and hybridized overnight at that temperature.<br>
The samples were then slowly cooled to 30°C. Thereafter, a mixture of RNases A and T1 was<br>
added to digest single-stranded RNA leaving the double-stranded RNA formed by the probes<br>
annealing to their cognate mRNAs intact. Following proteinase K digestion and phenolchloroform<br>
extraction, the undigested double-stranded RNA was precipitated with ammonium<br>
acetate and ethanol. After centrifugation at 14000-x g for 20min., the pellets are washed with<br>
90% ethanol and recentrifuged. The ethanol was removed and the pellets were dissolved in 5ul<br>
of formamide loading dye. The double-stranded RNAs were resolved on a 5%<br>
polyacrylamide/urea gel run in TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried at 80°C<br>
under vacuum and then exposed to a Phosphorlmager screen overnight. Detection and<br>
quantitation of the resolved bands on the gel were performed on a Storm Phosphorlmager™<br>
system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).<br>
[0031] Statistical significance<br>
[0032] All values in the figures and text are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean<br>
(SEM). The statistical significance of any difference among groups was analyzed using<br>
Student's two-tailed t test for equal and unequal variance observations, P values of 
considered to be statistically significant.<br>
[0033] Results<br>
[0034] Macroscopic Findings<br>
[0035] 8 days after TNBS; 5-Day Treatment<br>
[0036] The macroscopic injury observed at 8 days after rats received TNBS was 4.5 ± 0.5.<br>
This value indicated that the distal 8 cm of colon contained more than 2 discrete ulcers in an<br>
area of inflammation (Figure 2). in contrast, combination therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA<br>
combination acted synergistically to cause a significant reduction in macroscopic injury as<br>
reflected by an injury score of 2.6 ± 0.7; p
caused reduction in macroscopic injury (4.1 ± 0.6 and 3.0 ± 0.7, respectively) but these values<br>
did not achieve significance when compared to TNBS alone.<br>
[0037] 11 days after TNBS; 8-Day Treatment<br>
[0038] Visual evidence of colitis 11 days after TNBS was scored at4.1 ± 0.2 (Figure 3). Animal<br>
treated with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination for 8 days showed no evidence of mucosal<br>
inflammation on ulceration. The colonic mucosa in these animals appeared normal.<br>
Monotherapy with either NAC or 5-ASA alone showed mild inflammation and macroscopic injury<br>
scores were 1.2 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.2 respectively.<br>
[0039] Microscopic Findings<br>
 [0040] 8 ofays after TNBS; 5-Day Treatment<br>
[0041] The cumulative or aggregate microscopic colitis Injury score for rats examined 8 days<br>
after TNBS was 9.4 ± 1.0 which represented moderately severe colitis (Figure 4). Individual<br>
therapy for 5 days with either 5-ASA or NAC alone did not alter the aggregate injury score: 9.0<br>
± 0.9 and 9.0 ± 1.8, respectively. Therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination, however,<br>
caused significant reduction (-44%) in cumulative colitis injury and resulted in a score of 5.0 ±<br>
1.2, PO.02. Subset analysis of individual histological features, when compared to TNBS alone,<br>
indicated that therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination acted synergistically to significantly<br>
reduce the degree of epithelial damage, the extent of mucosal ulceration and the amount of<br>
mononuclear cell infiltration.<br>
[0042] 11 days after TNBS; 8-Day Treatment<br>
[0043] Eleven days post TNBS the indices of microscopic colitis were reduced slightly but not<br>
significantly from aggregate scores recorded at 8 days after TNBS: 7.0 ± 0.9 vs 9.5 ± 1.0;<br>
P&gt;0.1. In contrast to the histological results after 5 days of treatment each of the intraluminal<br>
therapies for 8 days caused significant reduction in global measures of colitis (Figure 5). 5-ASA<br>
and NAC each when administered alone caused comparable decrease in aggregate injury of<br>
46 and 53%, respectively. Combination therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination caused<br>
a 75% reduction in cumulative colitis injury score: 1.8 ± 0.5 vs 7.0 ± 0.9 TNBS alone; P
Furthermore, comparisons between monotherapies with either 5-ASA or NAC alone and<br>
combination therapy indicated that the NAC plus 5-ASA combination acted synergistically to<br>
produce a significantly greater degree of healing than either NAC or 5-ASA alone.<br>
[0044] Myeloperoxidase Activity<br>
[0045] MPO activity in colonic tissue 11 days after TNBS treatment was elevated greater than<br>
25 fold above values derived from saline treated rats (Figure 6). In contrast, the NAC plus 5-<br>
ASA combination treatment for 8 days reduced MPO activity by 85% to 100.9 ± 12.9 ng/g (P<br>
O.004 vs TNBS 690.2 ± 101.5 ng/g). MPO activity was also reduced by both NAC and 5-ASA<br>
alone to levels that were 40% and 32% below TNBS values but these differences did not<br>
achieve statistical significance.<br>
[0046] Inflammatory Cytokine Expression<br>
[0047] Cytokine gene expression in colonic tissues indicate that elevations in interleukins (IL<br>
1a, IL 1b, IL-4 and IL-6) and TNF a that were induced by TNBS after 11 days were inhibited<br>
significantly by 8 day treatment with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination (Table 3), Treatments<br>
with .either NAC or 5-ASA alone did not significantly suppress levels of cytokine expression<br>
induced by TNBS.<br>
(Table Removed) [0048] Results of the TNBS experiments of the present study indicate that intraluminal<br>
administration of the NAC plus 5-ASA combination to the distal colon of rats with TNBS colitis<br>
act synergistically to cause a significant reduction in colonic inflammation and ulceration and<br>
acceleration of mucosal healing when compared to either agent used alone. Furthermore,<br>
combination therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination caused significantly greater<br>
inhibition of myeloperoxidase activity and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in colons<br>
of TNBS treated animals than either NAC or 5-ASA alone. Duration of treatment was a<br>
determinant in the effectiveness of antioxidant and anti-Inflammatory agents on healing of<br>
chemically induced colitis. The NAC plus 5-ASA combination was the only dosing regimen that<br>
resulted in significant improvement in both macroscopic and microscopic measures of colitis<br>
after a five day treatment. In contrast, eight day treatment with NAC alone, 5-ASA alone or the<br>
NAC plus 5-ASA combination resulted in significant improvement in histobgical features of<br>
colitis. Treatmentwith the NAC plus 5-ASA combination, however, caused greater improvement<br>
in mucosai injury, inflammation and epithelial regeneration than NAC or 5-ASA alone. Data<br>
derived from these studies indicate that intraluminal therapy with the antioxidant NAC plus 5-<br>
ASA combination is superior to either agent alone in the treatment of TNBS colitis and that dual<br>
therapy has a synergistic effect in reducing inflammation and promoting mucosal repair.<br>
[0049] Colitis induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS manifests many of the histobgical and<br>
clinical features of colonic inflammatory bowel disease (11). This model of colonic ulceration<br>
and transmural inflammation of the mucosa (12) has been employed to study the pathogenesis<br>
of colonic inflammation and to investigate potential treatments of IBD. In this latter regard<br>
previous reports have shown that both 5-ASA and NAC, when administered singly by<br>
intracolonic route to rats, (9, 13) exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on TNBS colitis.<br>
Furthermore, the antioxidant NAC was observed to increase colonic glutathione stores which<br>
were associated with a reciprocal decrease in the extent of mucosal injury (9). In support of<br>
these observations and the role of ROS generation in TNBS colitis Loguercio et al reported that<br>
glutathione supplementation improved oxidative damage in TNBS colitis (14).<br>
 [0050] Antioxidants, such as NAC, and 5-ASA possess the ability to scavenge oxygen free<br>
radicals, inhibit inducible NO formation and to down regulate nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) activity<br>
(9,10,15-17). Furthermore, antioxidants, such as phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone, and 5-ASA have<br>
been shown to inhibit cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor TNFa, and to retard<br>
adhesion module expression and B-cell mediated antibody production (10, 18-20) in<br>
experimented models of colitis. Separately and together these agents can, thus, be envisioned<br>
to moderate immunocyte (T cell) mediated cytokine elaboration, neutrophil generation of ROS<br>
and NO, prostaglandin release and to facilitate an environment for unopposed cellular and<br>
growth factor-mediated tissue repair. These results show that treatment with the NAC plus 5-<br>
ASA combination cause marked improvement in indices of colitis and, furthermore, demonstrate<br>
prominent features of epithelial repair, and mucosal architectural and glandular restoration.<br>
These data combined with the near normalization of MPO activity and marked reduction in<br>
cytokine (ILa, ILb, IL6) expression indicate that therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination<br>
exerts a significantly greater anti-inflammatory and reparative effect in TNBS colitis than either<br>
5-ASA or NAC when used alone.<br>
[0051] Results in the DSS experiments demonstrated that DSS under these experimental<br>
conditions produced mild to moderate colitis. The aggregate microscopic injury score for DSS<br>
treated animals was 5.5 ±2.0; maximal score 12. Monotherapy with either 5-ASA or NAC alone<br>
caused slight reduction in aggregate scores to 4.1 ± 0.9 and 4.0 ±1.1, respectively. These<br>
values were not significantly different from DSS alone. In contrast, combination therapy with<br>
the NAC plus 5-ASA combination reduced global or aggregate histological injury score by 67%<br>
to 1.8 ± 0.8. Furthermore, the NAC plus 5-ASA combination caused significant improvement<br>
in epithelial damage when compared to DSS alone. DSS colitis was associated with elevated<br>
CRP values of 7.0 ± 0.6 mg/ml. CPR levels were reduced substantially by concurrent therapy<br>
with NAC plus 5-ASA and values were 1.0 ± 0.3 mg/ml. Similar reductions in CRP levels were<br>
observed with either 5-ASA or NAC alone. DSS treatment caused marked elevation in cytokine<br>
gene expression for IL 1a and IL 1b and these values represented a 6.8 and 12.1 fold increase,<br>
respectively, in gene expression of these cytokines when measured above control values.<br>
[0052] NAC and 5-ASA, alone or in combination, substantially reduced DSS-induced IL1a and<br>
IL1 b gene expression by 55-90% to levels that approximated control values. Conclusions from<br>
these data indicate that intraluminal therapy with the NAC plus 5-ASA combination caused<br>
significant amelioration of mucosal injury induced by DSS. Combination treatment with the NAC<br>
plus 5-ASA combination results were associated with substantial reduction in serum CRP levels<br>
and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression.<br>
[0053] Current considerations of the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation in IBD involve a<br>
number of steps from antigen presentation and processing by macrophages to amplification of<br>
Tcell activation and differentiation and cytokine production (1). In addition, inflammatory cells,<br>
including granulocytes and mononuclear cells, are recruited to the -mucosa in a highly<br>
coordinated fashion. Once present in the inflamed mucosa, tissue injury is enhanced by<br>
neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and an increase in the<br>
expression of the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) (5). Mucosal healing is thought to<br>
occur, in part, by reduction in injurious and proinflammatory substances and, also, by local<br>
liberation of growth factors which facilitate cellular restitution and repair (2). Although several<br>
experimental approaches have been employed that suggest the importance of enhanced<br>
production of superoxide and nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of IBD, inconsistent results have<br>
this issue unresolved (5). The beneficial effect superoxide dismutase (SOD) treatment in<br>
experimental models of colitis (21-23) has shown limited effect in humans with IBD (24). in<br>
addition, iNOS inhibition has shown variable results in experimental models of IBD (25-27).<br>
However, recent studies using gene-targeted mice suggest a dominant role of iNOS-derived<br>
NO in a murine model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis (5). The antioxidants NAC and<br>
phenyl N-tert butylnitrone have been shown to be effective in reducing the injurious<br>
consequences of TNBS colitis in rats (9) and DOS colitis in mice (10), respectively. Antioxidant<br>
therapy has also been demonstrated to suppress colonic INOS activity and to decrease NF-«B<br>
DNA-binding activity in experimental colitis (10) and man (16).<br>
[0054] In conclusion, our results showed that treatment of TNBS-lnduced colitis with the NAC<br>
plus 5-ASA combination was superior to either 5-ASA or NAC when used alone in reducing<br>
colonic inflammation and in promoting mucosal repair, in addition, combination therapy with the<br>
NAC plus 5-ASA combination acted synergistically to result in a significant reduction in MPO<br>
activity and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression.<br>
UTILITY<br>
[0055] The present invention provides a method for the treatment of a mammal subject<br>
(including humans) afflicted with inflammatory diseases, and in particular, inflammatory bowel<br>
diseases. The present invention has several advantages over current therapies. As<br>
demonstrated herein, combination therapy with 5-ASA plus an antioxidant is synergistically<br>
superior to either agent alone in controlling mucosal inflammation. It is envisioned that such<br>
combination therapy would be capable of being delivered by oral route, employing existing<br>
coating technologies, to sites of inflammation. In addition, such combination therapy would be<br>
amenable to local therapy in the distal colon and rectum by enema or suppository. Further<br>
description regarding deliver methods and dosing systems and protocols is discussed below.<br>
[0056] The combination of at least two active anti-inflammatory agents into a single delivery<br>
system as described herein provides greater clinical efficacy, development of a new<br>
pharmacochemical strategy for treating mucosal inflammatory conditions, and a reduction in<br>
the need for other potentially toxic and expensive anti-inflammatory agents. The chemical<br>
coupling of 5-ASA to an antioxidant substance can provide a further pharmacological approach<br>
to the treatment of mucosal inflammatory conditions such as IBD.<br>
[0057] The 5-ASA used in the composition of the present invention may be provided as the free<br>
acid, or as a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or ester, for example as described in U .5. Patent<br>
No. 5,013,727, the entirety of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
 [0058] Both 5-ASA andantioxidants such as MAC and pheny! N-tert-butylnitrone have relatively<br>
low profiles fortoxicity. 5-ASA may be associated with allergic reactions to the medications and<br>
should be avoided in patients with aspirin sensitivity. As with any nonsteroidal agent there<br>
exists potential for hepatic and renal toxicity. N-acetylcysteine or Mucomyst™ has had a wide<br>
experience in man for the treatment of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. This agent has proven<br>
safe. Other antioxidants contemplated for use herein in conjunction with 5-ASA include other<br>
aminosalicylates including 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA), and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid;<br>
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including those that inhibit cyclooxygenase<br>
I and/or II, such as sulindac, celecoxib and refacoxib; ascorbate; vitamin C; vitamin A; Vitamin<br>
E; beta-carotene; herbal agents such as milk thistle; selenium; iron in various ferric and ferrous<br>
formulations; phospholipase A2 inhibitors, e.g., carboxymethylcellulose-linked<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine; superoxide dismutase mimectics, such as Mn(il/lll) tetrakis (1-<br>
methyl-4-peridyl) of NmTMPyP; melatonin; zolimid; rebamipide; and phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone<br>
(PBN); and combinations of any of the above.<br>
[0059] While is it contemplated that applications of the invention would be principally of treating<br>
mucosal inflammatory conditions associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as<br>
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and Behcet's disease, the invention would also have<br>
application to other disorders of the gastrointestinal tract such as radiation and infective<br>
enteritis, ischemic injury to the gastrointestinal tract, infectious, caustic agent-induced<br>
gastrointestinal injury, hemorrhagic rectal ulcer, ileum pouchitis, ischemic enteritis and druginduced<br>
colitis, mucous colitis, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, non-specific colonic ulcers,<br>
collagenous colitis, cathartic colon, ulcerative proctitis, idiopathic diffuse ulcerative nongranulomatous<br>
enteritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced inflammations, celiac<br>
sprue and the like. Furthermore, advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of<br>
gastrointestinal malignancies suggest a role for prostaglandins generated by the<br>
cyclooxygenase enzymes to have a role in neoplasia. It has been well established that<br>
nonspecific and specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors can reduce the propensity to neoplasia and<br>
malignancy in experimental models and in human subjects. Full appreciation of the role of<br>
prostaglandinsinthe cyclooxygenase system in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal malignancy<br>
is not complete. However, it is conceivable that therapies which combine inhibition<br>
prostaglandin synthesis through the cyclooxygenase enzymes and antioxidant therapies may<br>
have a beneficial role in preventing gastrointestinal malignancies such as colorectal cancer.<br>
[0060] The term "inflammation" as used herein is meant to include reactions of both the specific<br>
and non-specific defense systems. A specific defense system reaction is a specific immune<br>
system reaction response to an antigen. Examples of a specific defense system reaction<br>
include the antibody response to antigens such as rubella virus, and delayed-type<br>
hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells (as seen, for example, in individuals who test<br>
"positive" in the Mantaux test).<br>
[0061] A non-specific defense system reaction is an inflammatory response mediated by<br>
leukocytes incapable of immunological memory. Such cells include granulocytes,<br>
macrophages, neutrophils, for example. Examples of a non-specific defense system reaction<br>
include the immediate swelling at the site of a bee sting, the reddening and cellular infiltrate<br>
induced at the site of a burn and the collection of PMN leukocytes at sites of bacterial infection<br>
(e.g., pulmonary infiltrates in bacterial pneumonias, pus formation in abscesses).<br>
[0062] Although the invention is particularly suitable for cases of acute inflammation, it also has<br>
utility for chronic inflammation. Types of inflammation that can be treated with the present<br>
invention include diffuse inflammation, traumatic inflammation, immunosuppression, toxic<br>
inflammation, specific inflammation, reactive inflammation, parenchymatous inflammation,<br>
obliterative inflammation, interstitial inflammation, croupous inflammation, and focal<br>
inflammation.<br>
[0063] Atherapeutically effective amount of a composition of the present invention refers to an<br>
amount which is effective in controlling, treating or moderating the inflammatory response. The<br>
terms "controlling", "treating" or "moderating" are intended to refer to all processes wherein<br>
there may be a slowing, Interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of the disease<br>
and does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disease symptoms.<br>
[0064] The term "therapeutically effective amount" is further meant to define an amount<br>
resulting in the improvement of any parameters or clinical symptoms characteristic of the<br>
inflammatory response. The actual dose will be different for the various specific molecules, and<br>
will vary with the patient's overall condition, the seriousness of the symptoms, and counter<br>
indications.<br>
[0065] As used herein, the term "subject" or "patient" refers to a warm blooded animal such as<br>
a mammal which is afflicted with a particular inflammatory disease state. It is understood that<br>
guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, llamas, and humans are<br>
among the examples of animals within the scope of the meaning of the term.<br>
[0066] A therapeutically effective amount of the compound used in the treatment described<br>
herein can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the<br>
use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous<br>
circumstances. In determining the therapeutically effective dose, a number of factors are<br>
considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal;<br>
its size, age, and general health; the specific disease or condition involved; the degree of or<br>
involvement or the severity of the disease or condition; the response of the individual subject;<br>
the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability<br>
characteristic of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of<br>
concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.<br>
[0067] A therapeutically effective amount of the compositions of the present invention will<br>
generally contain sufficient active ingredient (i.e., the antioxidant and 5-ASA) to deliver from<br>
about 0.1 /yg/kg to about 6000 mg/kg (weight of active ingredient/body weight of patient).<br>
Preferably, the composition will deliver at least 1.0 //g/kg to 1000 mg/kg, and more preferably<br>
at least 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, although each dose of the composition may be more or less<br>
than these amounts. For example, the daily dose for an adult may be in the range of about 10<br>
mg to 300 mg/kg, preferably In the range of about 20 mg to 300 mg/kg, especially in the range<br>
of 50 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg. Also see U.S. 5,013,727 which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0068] Practice of the method of the present invention comprises administering to a subject a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the composition described herein, in any suitable systemic<br>
or local formulation, in an amount effective to deliver the dosages listed above. The dosage<br>
can be administered on a one-time basis, or (for example) from one to five times per day or<br>
once ortwice perweek, or continuously via a venous drip, depending on the desired therapeutic<br>
effect.<br>
[0069] As noted, preferred amounts and modes of administration are able to be determined by<br>
one skilled in the art. One skilled in the art of preparing formulations can readily select the<br>
proper form and mode of administration depending upon the particular characteristics of the<br>
compound selected, the disease state to be treated, the stage of the disease, and other<br>
relevant circumstances using formulation technology known in the art, described, for example,<br>
in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, latest edition, Mack Publishing Co.<br>
[0070] Pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured utilizing techniques known in the art.<br>
Typically the therapeutically effective amount of the compound will be admixed with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[0071] The compounds or compositions of the present invention may be administered by a<br>
variety of routes, for example, orally, intrarectally or parenterally (i.e., subcutaneously,<br>
intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or intratracheally).<br>
[0072] For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated into solid or liquid<br>
preparations such as capsules, pills, tablets, lozenges, melts, powders, suspensions, or<br>
emulsions. Solid unit dosage forms can be capsules of the ordinary gelatin type containing, for<br>
example, surfactants, lubricants and inert fillers such as lactose, sucrose, and cornstarch or<br>
they can be sustained release preparations.<br>
[0073] In another embodiment, the compounds of this invention can be tabletted with<br>
conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose, and cornstarch in combination with binders,<br>
such as acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin, disintegrating agents such as potato starch or alginic<br>
acid, and a lubricant such as stearic acid or magnesium stearate. Liquid preparations are<br>
prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in an aqueous or non-aqueous pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvent which may also contain suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring<br>
agents, and preservative agents as are known in the art.<br>
[0074] For parenteral administration, the compounds may be dissolved in a physiologically<br>
acceptable pharmaceutical carrier and administered as either a solution or a suspension.<br>
Illustrative of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are water, saline, dextrose solutions, fructose<br>
solutions, ethanol, or oils of animal, vegetative, or synthetic origin. The pharmaceutical carrier<br>
may also contain preservatives, and buffers as are known in the art.<br>
[0075] The compounds of this invention can also be administered topically. "This can be<br>
accomplished by simply preparing a solution of the compound to be administered, preferably<br>
using a solvent known to promote transdermal absorption such as ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(DMSO) with or without other excipients. Preferably topical administration will be accomplished<br>
using a patch either of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety.<br>
[0076] As noted above, the compositions can also include an appropriate carrier. For topical<br>
use, any of the conventional excipients may be added to formulate the active ingredients into<br>
a lotion, ointment, powder, cream, spray, or aerosol. For surgical implantation, the active<br>
ingredients may be combined with any of the well-known biodegradable and bioerodible<br>
carriers, such as polylactic acid and collagen formulations. Such materials may be in the form<br>
of solid implants, sutures, sponges, wound dressings, and the like. In any event, for local use<br>
of the materials, the active ingredients usually be present in the carrier or excipient in a weight<br>
ratio of from about 1:1000 to 1:20,000, but are not limited to ratios within this range.<br>
Preparation of compositions for local use are detailed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>
latest edition, (Mack Publishing).<br>
[0077] Additional pharmaceutical methods may be employed to control the duration of action.<br>
Increased half and controlled release preparations may be achieved through the use of<br>
polymers to conjugate, complex with, or absorb the composition described herein. The<br>
controlled delivery and/or increased half-life may be achieved by selecting appropriate<br>
macromolecules (for example, polysaccharides, polyesters, polyamino acids, homopolymers<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, ethylenevinylacetate, methylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, and<br>
acrylamides such as N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide, and the appropriate concentration<br>
of macromolecules as well as the methods of incorporation, in order to control release.<br>
[0078] Another possible method useful in controlling the duration of action by controlled release<br>
preparations and half-life is incorporation of the glycosulfopeptide molecule or its functional<br>
derivatives into particles of a polymeric material such as polyesters, polyamides, polyamino<br>
acids, hydrogels, poly(lacticacid), ethylene vinylacetate copolymers, copolymer micelles of, for<br>
example, PEG and poly(l-aspartamide).<br>
[0079] Alternatively, it is possible to entrap the compostions in microcapsules prepared, for<br>
example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (for example,<br>
hydroxymethylcelluloseorgelatine-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules,<br>
respectively), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres,<br>
microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques<br>
are disclosed in the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>
[0080] U.S. Patent No. 4,789,734 describe methods for encapsulating compositions in<br>
liposomes and is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein. Essentially, the material<br>
is dissolved in an aqueous solution, the appropriate phospholipids and lipids added, along with<br>
surfactants if required, and the material dialyzed or sonicated, as necessary. A review of known<br>
methods is by G. Gregoriadis, Chapter 14. "Liposomes", Drug Carriers in Biology and<br>
Medicine, pp. 287-341 (Academic Press, 1979). Microspheres formed of polymers or proteins<br>
are well known to those skilled in the art, and can be tailored for passage through the<br>
gastrointestinal tract directly into the blood stream. Alternatively, the agents can be<br>
incorporated and the microspheres, or composite of microspheres, implanted for slow release<br>
over a period of time, ranging from days to months. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,906,474; 4,925,673; and 3,625,214 which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0081] When the composition is to be used as an injectable material, it can be formulated into<br>
a conventional injectable carrier. Suitable carriers include biocompatible and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable phosphate buffered saline solutions, which are preferably isotonic.<br>
[0082] For reconstitution of a lyophiiized product in accordance with this invention, one may<br>
employ a sterile diluent, which may contain materials generally recognized for approximating<br>
physiological conditions and/or as required by governmental regulation. In this respect, the<br>
sterile diluent may contain a buffering agent to obtain a physiologically acceptable pH, such as<br>
sodium chloride, saline, phosphate-buffered saline, and/or other substances which are<br>
physiologically acceptable and/or safe for use. In general, the material for intravenous injection<br>
in humans should conform to regulations established by the Food and Drug Administration,<br>
which are available to those in the field.<br>
[0083] The pharmaceutical composition may also be in the form of an aqueous solution<br>
containing many of the same substances as described above for the reconstitution of a<br>
lyophiiized product.<br>
[0084] The compounds can also be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid- or<br>
base- addition salt, formed by reaction with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromicacid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanicacid, sulfuricacid, and phosphoric acid,<br>
and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid,<br>
pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, or by<br>
reaction with an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, and organic bases such as mono-, di-, trialkyl and aryl amines and substituted<br>
ethanolamines.<br>
[0085] As mentioned above, the compounds of the invention may be incorporated into<br>
pharmaceutical preparations which may be used for therapeutic purposes. However, the term<br>
"pharmaceutical preparation" is intended in a broader sense herein to' include preparations<br>
containing a 5-ASA/antioxidant composition in accordance with this invention, used not only for<br>
therapeutic purposes but also for reagent or diagnostic purposes as known in the art, or for<br>
tissue culture. The pharmaceutical preparation intended for therapeutic use should contain a<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable" or"therapeutically effective amount" of the composition, i.e., that<br>
amount necessary for preventative or curative health measures. If the pharmaceutical<br>
preparation is to be employed as a reagent or diagnostic, then it should contain reagent or<br>
diagnostic amounts of a 5-ASA/antioxidant combination.<br>

[0087] The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments<br>
described herein, since such embodiments are intended as but single illustrations of one aspect<br>
of the invention and any functionally equivalent embodiments are within the scope of this<br>
invention. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and<br>
