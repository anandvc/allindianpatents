The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority from co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/039,619 filed March 26, 2008 and entitled SULFOXIDATION CATALYSTS AND METHODS, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference to the extent not inconsistent the present disclosure.<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002] The disclosure generally relates to catalyst compounds, catalytic processes, and methods for synthesizing catalytic compounds. Specifically, the disclosure relates to sulfoxidation reactions, catalysts for sulfoxidation, methods of synthesis of sulfoxidation catalysts, and systems and methods of catalytic sulfoxidation reactions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE [0003] A globally recognized need to reduce sulfur levels in hydrocarbon streams such as gasoline and diesel fuels currently exists. The reduction of sulfur in such hydrocarbon streams may greatly improve air quality because of the negative impact sulfur has on performance of sulfur sensitive components such as automotive catalytic converters. The presence of oxides of sulfur in automotive engine exhaust may inhibit and eventually poison noble metal catalysts within catalytic converters and emission of those oxides of sulfur can have a negative impact on the environment. Emissions from inefficient or poisoned catalytic converters contain levels of many other undesirable materials, such as: non-combusted- non-methane hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide.  Such emissions may be photoconverted by sunlight generating ground level ozone, known also as smog.<br>
[0004] Thermally processed gasolines such as, for example, thermally cracked gasoline, visbreaker gasoline, coker gasoline and catalytically cracked gasoline (hereinafter collectively referred to as "cracked gasoline") contain, in part, olefins, aromatics, sulfur, and sulfur-containing compounds. Given that most gasolines, such as, automobile gasolines, racing gasolines, aviation gasolines, boat gasolines, and the like contain blends of, at least in part, cracked gasoline, reduction of sulfur in cracked gasoline will inherently facilitate reduction of [0005]<br>
2<br><br>
sulfur levels in most gasolines, including: automobile gasolines, racing gasolines, aviation gasolines, boat gasolines, and the like.<br>
[0006] There is a growing public recognition that lower sulfur gasoline reduces automotive emissions and improves air quality. Thus, the US Environmental Protection Agency rules to date have focused on the required level of reduction, the geographical areas in need of lower sulfur gasoline, and the time frame for implementation.<br>
[0007] As the concern over the impact of automotive air pollution continues, it is clear that further effort to reduce the sulfur level in automotive fuels will be required. In 2008, the US Environmental Protection Agency standards will effectively require every blend of gasoline sold in the United States to meet a 30-ppm sulfur level.<br>
[0008] In addition to the need to be able to produce low sulfur content automotive fuels, there is also a need for the implementation of systems and processes that will have a minimal effect on the olefin content of such fuels so as to maintain the octane number (both research and motor octane number). Such systems and processes would be desirable since saturation of olefins greatly affects the octane number. Such adverse effect on the olefin content is generally due to the severe conditions normally employed, such as during hydrodesulfurization, to remove thiophenic compounds (such as, for example, thiophenes, benzothiophenes, alkyl thiophenes, alkylbenzothiophenes, alkyl dibenzothiophenes and the like) which are some of the most difficult sulfur containing compounds to remove from cracked gasoline. In addition, there is a need to avoid systems and processes wherein the conditions are such that the aromatic content of the cracked gasoline is lost through saturation. Thus, there is a need for systems and processes that achieves desulfurization and maintains the octane number.<br>
[0009] However, current processes may have adverse effects on the olefin content which may be generally due to the severe conditions normally employed, such as during hydrodesulfurization, to remove thiophenic compounds (such as, for example, thiophenes, benzothiophenes, alkyl thiophenes, alkylbenzothiophenes, alkyl dibenzothiophenes and the like). In removing sulfur from diesel fuels by hydrodesulfurization, the cetane number is typically improved; however there is a large cost in hydrogen consumption, since hydrogen is consumed by both hydrodesulfurization and aromatic hydrogenation reactions.<br>
[00010]	In addition to the need for removal of sulfur from cracked gasolines, there is also<br>
a need for the petroleum industry to reduce the sulfur content in diesel fuels. In general, it is<br>
3<br><br>
much harder to remove sulfur from diesel fuel as compared to gasoline. Further, the high-<br>
pressure and high temperature required by hydro desulfurization requires expensive capital<br>
equipment infrastructure and high operating cost to achieve mandated low levels of sulfur.<br>
[00011]	Thus, there is a need for a desulfurization system and process without a<br>
significant consumption of hydrogen so as to provide a more economical process for the treatment of cracked gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
[00012]	Some prior art catalysts include harsh acids, such as sulfuric acid, which are<br>
difficult to separate from the reaction mixture and have demonstrated incomplete conversion of desired reaction components. Transition metal catalysts are typically more facile to separate from the reaction mixture owing to their substantially different physical and chemical properties. Solid state heterogeneous catalysts are particularly facile to separate from liquid and gaseous reaction mixtures.<br>
[00013]	As a result of the lack of success in providing a successful and economically<br>
feasible process for the reduction of sulfur levels in cracked gasolines and diesel fuels combined with the fact that crude oil supplies are growing more sour (sulfur-rich) each day, it is apparent that there is a need for better catalyst systems and processes for the desulfurization of such hydrocarbon streams which have minimal effect on octane levels while achieving high levels of sulfur removal.<br>
[00014]	Thus, there exists a need for an economical and efficient catalytic desulfurization<br>
process for the treatment of sulfur-containing hydrocarbon streams, e.g., crude and crude oil distillates.<br>

[00036]	In general, “substituted” as used herein refers to an alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
cycloalkylalkyl, heterocyclyl, or heterocyclylalkyl group, as defined below (e.g., an alkyl group) in which one or more bonds to a hydrogen atom contained therein are replaced by a bond to non-hydrogen or non-carbon atoms. Substituted groups also include groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s) atom are replaced by one or more bonds, including double or triple bonds, to a heteroatom. Thus, a substituted group will be substituted with one or more substituents, unless otherwise specified. In some embodiments, a substituted group is substituted with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 substituents. Examples of substituent groups include: halogens (i.e., F, Cl, Br, and I); hydroxyls; alkoxy, alkenoxy, heterocyclyloxy, and heterocyclylalkoxy groups;<br><br><br>

[00043]	Although the phrase “aryl groups” includes groups containing fused rings, such as<br>
fused aromatic-aliphatic ring systems (e.g., indanyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, and the like), it does not include aryl groups that have other groups, such as alkyl or halo groups, bonded to one of the ring members. Rather, groups such as tolyl are referred to as substituted aryl groups.<br>
Representative substituted aryl groups can be mono-substituted or substituted more than once. For example, monosubstituted aryl groups include, but are not limited to, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-substituted phenyl or naphthyl groups, which can be substituted with substituents such as those listed above<br>
[00044]	Aralkyl groups are alkyl groups as defined above in which a hydrogen or carbon<br>

Heterocyclyl groups encompass unsaturated, partially saturated and saturated ring systems, such as, for example, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl and imidazolidinyl groups. However, the phrase “heterocyclyl group” does not include heterocyclyl groups that have other groups, such as alkyl, oxo or halo groups, bonded to one of the ring members. Rather, these are referred to as “substituted heterocyclyl groups”. Heterocyclyl groups include, but are not limited to, aziridinyl, azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, thiazolidinyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, dioxolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, pyrrolyl, pyrrolinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazolinyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, thiazolinyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, oxathiane, dioxyl, dithianyl, pyranyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, dihydropyridyl, dihydrodithiinyl, dihydrodithionyl, homopiperazinyl, quinuclidyl, indolyl, indolinyl, isoindolyl,azaindolyl (pyrrolopyridyl), indazolyl, indolizinyl, benzotriazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiophenyl, benzthiazolyl, benzoxadiazolyl, benzoxazinyl, benzodithiinyl, benzoxathiinyl,<br>

Embodiments described herein relate to catalysts suitable for use in the oxidative desulfurization of hydrocarbon fluid streams of crude oil, diesel fuels, and cracked gasolines (e.g. thermally processed gasoline such as thermally cracked gasoline, visbreaker gasoline, coker gasoline and catalytically cracked gasoline) and distillates derived therefrom. Embodiments described herein relate to systems and methods for the removal of sulfur compounds from fluid streams of cracked gasoline and diesel fuels employing the above catalysts. Embodiments described herein also relate to fuel products and lubricants derived from the catalyst treated hydrocarbon fluid streams described in the present disclosure.<br><br><br>
[00049]	The catalyst compositions described herein may comprise metal complexes. In<br>
some embodiments, the metal complex may be represented by the formula MmOm(OR)n, where M is a metal complex, such as, for example, titanium or any metal, including, but not limited to, rhenium, tungsten or other transition metals alone or in combination that causes the chemical conversion of the sulfur species, as described herein. R is carbon group having at least 3 carbon atoms, where at each occurrence R may individually be a substituted alkyl group containing at least one OH group, a substituted cycloalkyl group containing at least one OH group, a substituted cycloalkylalkyl group containing at least one OH group, a substituted heterocyclyl group containing at least one OH group, or a heterocyclylalkyl containing at least one OH group.

Other examples of metal alkoxides include bis(ethyleneglycol)oxotitanium (IV), bis(erythritol)oxotitanium (IV), and bis(sorbitol)oxotitanium (IV). The catalysts described herein may be used singly or in combinations in the catalyzed reactions described herein where metal M is any metal that causes the chemical conversion of the sulfur species, as described herein.<br>
[00050]	There is a right here in may further comprise a metal complex containing<br>
polymer. In some embodiments, the metal complex containing Polymer may be represented graphically by Figures 6-9.<br>
[00051]	In some embodiments, the catalysts described herein may be contacted with an<br>
organic fluid (such as a hydrocarbon) solution or stream containing at least one sulfur compound, in the presence of an oxidant (oxidizing agent), resulting in the catalyst catalyzing the oxidation of the sulfur compound, resulting in the oxidized sulfur compound having a higher solubility in the catalyst solution than in hydrocarbon fluid. Examples of suitable organic fluids include, but not limited to, gasolines (including cracked gasolines described above), diesel fuel, jet oils, heavy oils, heavy sour crude oil, other derived products typical of petroleum refinery products and intermediates, and combinations thereof. Examples of sulfur compounds include, but are not limited to, alkyl-thios, aromatic-thiols, aromatic-sulfides, aromatic-sulfoxides, alkyl-thiophene, aromatic-thiophenes, other refractory sulfur-containing compounds, and combinations thereof.<br><br><br>
[00052]	The catalysts described herein may be utilized in biphasic reaction processes,<br>
wherein the sulfur compounds are at least partially extracted out of the organic fluid and into the aqueous phase, resulting in leaving the hydrocarbon fluid essentially sulfur free or at a reduced sulfur concentration. Examples of suitable phase transfer agent/solvents include polar protic liquids such as acetic acid, formic acid, propanoic acid, octenoic acid, butenoic acid, long chain aliphatic acids, alkyl substituted aromatic acids, the like, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable oxidants include, but are not limited to, O3, H2O2, NaOCl, O2, air, permanganate compounds, nitrous oxide, other suitable oxidants that readily react with the catalyst to cause the sulfoxidation reaction to occur according to the present disclosure. The oxidant may be delivered in the form of a solid, a liquid or a gas, and combinations thereof.<br>
[00053]	The reaction described herein may be carried out within a temperature range from<br>
about 20 °C to about 90 °C, such as between about 20 °C and about 50 °C. Higher reaction temperatures may accelerate the rate of reaction between the sulfur compound and the oxidant. Reaction schemes using temperatures higher than 90 °C may be hindered by non-productive decomposition of some oxidants, such as peroxides.<br>
[00054]	The concentration of catalyst may be in a range from about 100.00 % to 0.00004<br>
% by weight with respect to elemental sulfur, such as from about 100.00% to about 0.0004% by weight with respect to the weight of elemental sulfur. The catalyst may be present in homogeneous form (such as dissolved in an alcohol then added to the polar protic phase, for example) or heterogeneous form (such as a solid, such as in cases where the catalyst has a low solubility in the phase transfer agent/solvent). The solid catalysts as described herein may comprise any suitable form which affords efficient catalytic activity. For example, a catalyst may comprise a complex, a cluster complex, a mixture of isomers, a nano-dimensional material, a metal complex containing polymer or a combination thereof. Nano-dimensional materials may comprise nanoparticles of the catalyst, where the nanoparticles may be produced by controlled hydrolysis. The nanoparticles may be sintered following formation. Nanoparticles thus produced may be used as components of organic solutions, suspensions, and composites, and the like.<br>
[00055]	In some embodiments, a hydrocarbon fluid containing a sulfur compound may be<br>
brought into contact with a transfer agent/solvent containing the catalyst, in the presence of an oxidant. The catalyst may catalyze the oxidation of the sulfur compound, resulting in converting it to a compound which is soluble in the transfer agent/solvent, where the oxidized sulfur<br><br><br>
compound may then be extracted and removed from the hydrocarbon fluid. The fluid may be contacted with the catalyst solution in a continuous process or in a batch process. For example, a hydrocarbon stream (containing the sulfur compound) may be contacted with the catalyst solution at a location within a fixed bed reactor or at a location a flowing bed reactor for sufficient residence time to allow conversion (oxidation) of the sulfur compound to occur, followed by separation of the essentially sulfur-free hydrocarbon stream from the now sulfur-containing catalyst stream. The two separate phases may then be separated and materials (such as catalyst and solvents) may be recycled as needed.<br>
[00056]	Figure 1 is a process flow diagram of an embodiment of a sulfoxidation process<br>
such as those described above. Source A may comprise a sulfur-rich organic fluid stream input into the process at mixing point 1, where the organic fluid may be a fluid such as those described above. Source Q may comprise an oxidant introduced into the system at injection point 10, where the oxidant may comprise oxidants described above, where the oxidant mixes with the organic fluid stream at mixing point 1. Source Q may comprise an electric input in embodiments where the oxidant is produced by electrolysis.<br>
[00057]	The mixture from mixing point 1 may be combined with a catalyst in reactor 2 to<br>
form a biphasic oil-reaction mixture, resulting in the sulfoxidation of the sulfur-rich organic fluid within reactor 2. The catalyst may be those described above. The catalyst may enter the reactor 2 as a solid or liquid, and may be transferred to reactor 2 from mixing point 11. In some embodiments, the mixing performed at mixing points 1 and 11 may be performed at reactor 2, and reactor 2 may be a static mixer or a fixed bed reactor, continuously stirred reactor, when the catalyst is a solid, and the reagent mixtures are liquids and other known methods of performing catalytic biphasic reactions.<br>
[00058]	A biphasic oil-reaction stream B may be transferred from reactor 2 to separator 3,<br>
where a sulfur-rich polar extractate E may be separated from low-sulfur (or essentially sulfur-free) raffinate C. The sulfur-rich extractate E (comprising oxidized sulfur compounds and catalyst solution) may be transferred from the separator 3 to a distillation tower 4, where distillate overheads F (substantially pure extractant, such as solvent) may be separated via distillation from distillate heavies G, where distillate heavies may comprise oxidized sulfur compounds (such as organic sulfones) and catalyst. In some embodiments, separator 3 and<br><br><br>
distillation tower 4 can be combined into a single distillation tower. Distillate overheads F may be returned to mixing point 11 or to separator 3. Distillate overheads F recirculated to separator 3 may further extract sulfur compounds in separator 3, resulting in raffinate C being essentially sulfur-free. In some embodiments, the sulfur-rich extractate E may represent about 15% by weight of the biphasic oil-reaction stream B and the low-sulfur (or essentially sulfur-free) raffinate C may represent about 85% by weight of the biphasic oil-reaction stream B.<br>
[00059]	Distillate heavies G may be transferred to extractor 5, where catalyst may be<br>
extracted through process H using distillation tower 6, and solvent may be returned to extractor 5 through process I. Catalyst concentrate K may be returned to mixing point 11. The remaining sulfur-rich, salt-containing heavies J may be transferred from extractor 5 to extractor 7, where salts may be removed through aqueous wash output N and returned to reactor 10. Where the oxidant is NaOCl, the process at extractor 7 may comprise a salt extraction. Extractor 7 may comprise a solvent wash when other oxidants are used. Water may be introduced into extractor 7 through input L.<br>
[00060]	The sulfur rich heavy stream M (e.g., sulfur-rich organics) may be transferred<br>
from extractor 7 to reactor 8. Reactor 8 may comprise a high temperature reactor and may utilize a catalyst, such as a solid bed catalyst. At reactor 8, the sulfur rich heavies may be catalytically fractioned into SO2 and organic compounds, where SO2 may be removed from reactor 8 at SO2 output P as a gas. Recovered organic compounds O produced in reactor 8 (e.g. oil, etc.) may be transferred from reactor 8 to mixing point 9 where the organic compounds O are mixed with the substantially low-sulfur raffinate C and may be transferred to low sulfur hydrocarbon product stream output D<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
One Possible Embodiment of the Preparation of Bis (Glycerol) Oxotitanium (IV)<br>
[00061]	Titanium oxychloride (2 kilograms (kg), Millenium Chemicals) was diluted with<br>
de-ionized water (2 kg) and then added to a 20 liter (l) round bottom flask containing glycerine (2 kg). The mixture was allowed to stir until a straw color was attained. The 20 l round bottom flask was then heated to 50 °C under vacuum (-25 inches Hg) in a rotary evaporator to remove<br><br><br>
excess water and hydrochloric acid. When no further liquid condensate was noted, the flask was recharged with water (0.65 l) and rotary evaporated to further remove excess water and hydrochloric acid. This was repeated two additional times. After the final evaporation, the viscous, straw colored liquid was weighed (2.64 kg) and diluted with methoxypropanol (0.85 kg) to reduce the viscosity. This was then neutralized with triethylamine (3.3 kg, 33% weight/weight in ethanol). The combined neutralized solution was then chilled for several hours producing rodlike needles of triethylamine hydrochloride. The crystalline triethylamine hydrochloride was removed by vacuum filtration. The filtrate was added slowly to acetone (70 L) causing the product to precipitate as a white solid. The acetone was then decanted and an off-white solid residue was obtained. The off-white solid residue was then washed vigorously with hexanes (20 L) to afford a fine white powder. The powder was collected by filtration ( &gt; 63% yield based upon Ti). %Ti Calculated: 16.98. Analysis: 16.7; mp DSC (dec) 273 oC; ESI-MS (positive mode) 245 amu; 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) 4.25 (br s, 4 H), 3.45 (m, 2 H), 3.38 (m, 4 H), 3.31 (m, 4 H).<br>

stir bar. The monomer was added to the DMSO, followed by bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV), added in a 1:1 mole ratio relative to the monomer. The slurry was heated with stirring in a water bath set at 70°C for 1-4hrs, after which time the mixture turned into a transparent solution. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was transferred to a beaker and the product was precipitated using 5X acetone. After approximately 10-20 minutes, the precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. Yields are about 90+%.<br>
General Method A:<br>
[00063]	Model oil was prepared by dissolving dibenzothiophene (DBT) in tetralin to give<br>

combining glacial acetic acid and aliquots of titanium catalyst solution (40 wt% in methanol) and hydrogen peroxide with the diesel in a glass batch reactor. A heated circulating bath was used to control the temperature ( 323 K, ± 0.1K) of the reactor (J-KEM). The reactions were stirred with a mixing bar speed of about 400 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 30-60 minutes. The diesel phase was removed from the acid phase using a 1000-mL separatory funnel. The diesel was then extracted three times with fresh glacial acetic acid. Residual acetic acid in the diesel was<br><br><br>
removed by rotary evaporation. The sulfur content of the diesel was monitored over each step of the ODS process using an XOS Sindie 7039 XR X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.<br>

One Possible Embodiment of the Oxidant Utilization Selectivity<br>
[00079]	The hydrogen peroxide content of each phase was determined by titration with<br>
Ceric Sulfate, according to equation 1. After the titration endpoint had been reached, an excess of potassium iodide was added to the solution. The hydroiodic acid formed in acidic media reacts with peracetic acid to liberate iodine, according to equation 2. A standard solution of sodium thiosulfate was then used to titrate the liberated iodine, as shown in equation 3. The endpoint of this titration was used to calculate the peracetic acid content of each phase.<br><br>
[00080]	The titrations were performed manually using fresh, commercially available<br>
standardized reagents. The procedures were conducted quickly and at low temperature (0ºC) to<br>
prevent undesired degradations.<br>
Oxidations<br>
[00081]	The oxidation experiment utilized straight-run diesel (, 1.7446 % S) combined<br>
with three equivalents of glacial acetic acid in an open glass batch reactor. To this was added a<br>
measured aliquot of about 40% by weight solution of bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV)) in methanol<br>
followed by a measured quantity of the oxidant (50% H2O2, Aldrich) (5 mole equivalents: S). A<br>
heated circulating bath was used to control temperature (about ±0.1K) of the reactor (J-KEM),<br>
typically set at about 323 K (50 ºC). The reaction was agitated at about 1000 rpm for about 1<br><br><br>
hour with an overhead stirrer. A control reaction without Ti-catalyst was similarly run to quantify the autothermal degradation of hydrogen peroxide in the absence of the catalyst over the same time period.<br>
Titrations<br>
[00082]	An exactly weighed amount of the sample phase was added to an Erlenmeyer<br>
flask containing about 2 ml of 5 N ice-cooled sulfuric acid, about 25 g of ice (crushed cubes) and about 3 drops of ferroin indicator solution.<br>
[00083]	The sample was titrated with about 0.1 N cerium(IV) sulfate until the appearance<br>
of the color changed from salmon to light blue (endpoint). The volume of cerium(IV) sulfate used (Vol 1) was recorded at the endpoint.<br>
[00084]	Then about 10 ml of a 20% potassium iodide solution was added to the titrated<br>
sample and diluted to approx. 300 ml with de-ionized water (brown color). This was then titrated<br>
with about 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate until the brown color became pale. A few drops of starch<br>
solution were added and the titration was continued until the solution turned from purple to<br>
salmon/pink. The final volume of sodium thiosulfate used was recorded as the endpoint.<br>
[00085]	The content of hydrogen peroxide in the sample (% wt) was calculated as follows:<br>
%H2O2 = mL Ce(IV)Sulfate x 170.07/Sample Weight (mg)<br>
[00086]	The content of peracetic acid in the sample (% wt) was calculated as follows:<br>
%PAA = mL thiosulfate x 380.17/Sample Weight (mg)<br>
[00087]	The above procedure was repeated for each phase of the reaction (acetic acid<br>
phase and diesel phase) mixture in triplicate and the data was reported as the mean result.<br>

Table 1 for the purpose of fully demonstrating the unique selectivity demonstrated by the bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) catalyst towards sulfoxidation.<br>

[00089]	The Ti-catalyzed experiments were compared to control experiments conducted<br>
without Ti catalyst. Analysis by GC-SCD (insert conditions) shows substantially no sulfur-bearing species in the diesel phase of the Ti-catalyzed run, while the control lacking Ti displayed very little S-compound removed and a small amount removed was most likely by extraction.<br>

respect to the equilibrium distribution achieved in the batch system.<br>

[00091]	The results in Table 8 clearly demonstrate that contact time may be a relevant<br>
parameter to oxidant selectivity. Peroxide loss may most likely occur via oxygen evolution since the same amount of oxidant loss occurs with or without an oil phase (Columns 3&amp;4). Minimizing contact time appears to benefit selectivity (Columns 8&amp;9). Interestingly, straight-run diesel shows substantial oxidant loss without Ti-catalyst (Column 2) in contrast to the decalin system without Ti-catalyst (Column 5). Straight-run diesel does contain metals capable of catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction, and that may explain the aforementioned observation. In addition, direct oxidation of Sulfur -species according to Figure 2 (Mercaptans, etc) in diesel<br><br>
presents another potential pathway for oxidant utilization in the absence of catalyst. Clearly, peroxide loss may be minimized by shortening contact time, decreasing oxidant concentration, and increasing Sulfur:Ti ratio (to enhance rate). The optimum run time to complete conversion and maximum selectivity under these conditions appears to be 20 minutes or less based upon model systems.<br>

Conclusion<br>
[00095]	In summary, the bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) catalyzed oxidation of sulfur<br>
compounds in model diesel appears to possess very high oxidant selectivity to sulfone formation (99+%). Peroxide loss in straight-run diesel appears sensitive to contact time. As shown above, oxidant selectivity was at least greater than 99.0%.<br>
Substrate Selectivity<br>
Example 43<br>
[00096]	One possible embodiment of an indiscriminate effect of prior art catalysts on<br>
olefins is graphically demonstrated by the mechanism shown in Figure 10. To examine the selectivity towards olefin substrates using the catalyst of the present disclosure, experiments employing external, internal and mixed external and internal olefinic substrates were conducted.<br><br>
[00097]	Model oil was prepared by independently dissolving the olefin (styrene, trans-<br>
stilbene, and limonene) to 10% by weight in d8-toluene (6 grams). The oxidation experiments were carried out by combining acetic acid (18g) with the model oil in a glass batch reactor, adding 100μL of a 40% by weight solution of bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) in methanol and then<br>
adding 5 mole equivalents of 50% H2O2 solution (olefin basis). A heated circulating bath was<br>
used to control temperature (±0.1K) of the reactor (J-KEM), typically set at 323 K (50 ºC). The<br>
experiment was run for an hour with aliquots pulled at 15 minutes and 1 hour for conversion.<br>
After 15 minutes no oxidation was noted for either olefin by 1H- and 13C- nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance spectroscopic (NMR) analysis. After about 1 hour, no oxidation was observed for<br>
styrene and only partial epoxidation (13%) was noted for trans-stilbene during that period.<br>
[00098]	Model oil was prepared by dissolving carbazole (10%) ind8-toluene (6 grams).<br>
The oxidation experiment was carried out by combining acetic acid (18g) with the model oil in a glass batch reactor, adding 100μL of a 40% by weight solution of bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) in methanol and then adding 5 mole equivalents of 50% H2O2 solution (nitrogen basis). A heated circulating bath was used to control temperature (±0.1K) of the reactor (J-KEM), typically set at 323 K (50ºC). The experiment was run for an hour with aliquots pulled at 15 minutes and 1 hour for conversion. After 15 minutes complete oxidation was noted for carbazole as evidenced by disappearance of the N-H stretch by 1H-NMR. The catalyst appeared to oxidize aromatic amines.<br>
Experiment 44<br>
[00099]	Examination of the effect of the catalytic process of the present disclosure on<br>
tertiary benzylic hydrocarbons was performed employing a variation of General Method A, replacing DBT by cumene according to the quantities shown in the table below. The reaction was examined by chromatographic techniques and compared to the results for all inputs against standards. No cumene oxidation products were observed. Specifically, in an oil stream that contains benzylic hydrocarbons, the catalyst of the present disclosure appears to not adversely affect the product contents in the oil stream. The catalyst of the present disclosure appears to be highly sulfur specific. . In particular, if the oxidant were to adversely attack the hydrocarbons, then the quality of the fuel which was ultimately distilled would be reduced. Experiments 43 and 44 show that the catalytic process of the present disclosure does not significantly oxidize olefins, nor benzylic hydrocarbons, such results are considered to be new and unique with respect to the present disclosure.<br><br>

Possible Embodiments of the Refinery Feed Experiments [000100]        Experiments were conducted on various sources of refinery feeds, such as Straight-Run Diesel (~2.12% S), Combined Gas-Oil (2.90% S), Vacuum Gas-Oil (3.25% S), and crude oil (6.05%). Acetic acid, catalyst, and oxidant were added according to the feeds. Reactions were carried out in glass vessels heated in water bath (45-55ºC) for varying times. Aliquots of the oil layer were taken during and after the reaction to be analyzed for sulfur content by using a XOS Sindie 7039 XRF x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Some experiments included a complete separation of layers using a separation flask and BÜCHI Rotary evaporator.<br><br>

[000101]        It has been confirmed through extensive experimentation that a solid titanyl sulfoxidation catalyst containing the bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) composition described herein, when bound to a support surface (organic polymer or inorganic oxide) or within the backbone of a polymer, is effective to oxidize sulfur compounds from organic fluid streams. The resulting oxidized sulfur compounds may be substantially removed using commonly known separation techniques. Suitable oxidants may include, but are not limited to, H2O2, NaOC1, O2, Air, mixtures thereof, and other suitable oxidants that readily react with the solid titanyl sulfoxidation catalyst to affect the desired sulfoxidation. Suitable phase transfer agent/solvents may include, but are not limited to, polar protic liquids such as acetic acid, formic acid, propanoic acid, and the like. Suitable organic fluid streams may include, but are not limited to, gasolines, diesels, jet<br><br>
oils, heavy oils, heavy sour crude oil, and other derived products typical of refinery products and intermediates. Suitable sulfur compound substrates may include, but are not limited to, alkyl- or aromatic-thiols, -sulfides, -sulfoxides, alkyl- or aromatic-thiophenes and other refractory sulfur-containing compounds.<br>
[000102]        The solid titanyl Sulfoxidation catalysts utilized in the experiments were heterogeneous variants of the catalyst described above. The temperatures employed were relatively mild (ambient to 90C, typically less than 50C). The solid titanyl sulfoxidation catalysts concentrations were usually less than 0.004.<br>
[000103]        There are many organosulfur compounds in petroleum products with typical molecular structures being illustrated in Figure 2. Thiophenic (ring sulfur) compounds with alkyl substituents often boil significantly higher than the above parent compounds. Each carbon atom or methyl group R, R’ increases boiling point by 20º to 40ºF (12º to 22ºC). Oxidation of the sulfur tends to substantially increase the boiling point, sometimes by several hundred degrees C, facilitating separation by thermal techniques. In addition, sulfoxidation substantially changes the polarity of the product facility separation by extraction. Thus, sulfoxidation provides several alternative means of removing unwanted sulfur compounds from sulfur containing hydrocarbon streams.<br>
One Possible Embodiment of the Conventional Oxidation Mechanism [000104]        Conventional ODS theory describes sulfoxidation occurring initially to form sulfoxides and subsequently sulfoxides become sulfones via reaction with active oxygen in the form of a peracid generated in situ by interaction of an acid with an oxidant (i.e. hydrogen peroxide) in the presence of an acid catalyst (Figure 3). The reaction conditions are relatively mild (atmospheric pressure, 95º to 212ºF). Typically, the reaction mixture consists of two phases; however, at temperatures greater than 50C a single phase may result. Substantial extraction of sulfone occurs from the light phase (understood to have a density less than the heavy phase) into the heavy phase, reducing the net sulfur concentration in the hydrocarbon phase.<br>
[000105]        As illustrated in Figure 3, the reaction includes a nucleophilic attack of the sulfur bond by a peracid reagent, which generates a hydroxy sulfur intermediate that undergoes a rearrangement to produce a traditional organic acid byproduct and a sulfoxide intermediate. The sulfoxide intermediate may further undergo the same chemical reactions, nucleophilic attack with another peracid reagent to produce a carboxylic acid byproduct and the end product sulfone. If the reaction stops at a first step and does not undergo a second chemical attack by a peracid<br><br>
reagent, the reaction may stop at a sulfur-oxide intermediate stage, as shown at the bottom of Figure 3.<br>
[000106]        The above reaction, as illustrated in Figure 3, was initially believed to be the operative chemical reaction mechanism. However, after undertaking a detailed chemical kinetics study varying the substitution groups at the four and six position of dibenzothiophene, an important discovery was made. The substitution patterns on the chemical structure suggest that the reaction mechanism involves the titanium center in the oxidation mechanism, as shown in the more detailed diagram, Figure 4.<br>
[000107]        The kinetics experiments appeared to demonstrate that various sulfur compounds react with the catalyst at different rates. Referring now to the reaction mechanism illustrated in Figure 4 and the Kinetics plot obtained employing general method G illustrated in Figure 12, it is believed that a titanium species 50, such as, for example, bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV), and polymeric versions described herein, reacts with the sulfur compounds 52 and the like, to form an intermediate state 56. During this reaction, the oxygen atom attached to the titanium species 50 is transferred to the sulfur species 52 through a series of re-arrangement reaction steps at intermediate equilibrium state, 56. The chemical constitution of the sulfur compound 52 has a dramatic impact on how rapidly it interacts with the catalyst composition 50. [000108]        As stated above, Figure 4 illustrates the reaction mechanism that results in the formation of sulfoxide and ultimately toward the formation of the sulfone products 64. One feature of the catalyst is when the sulfur compound 52 approaches the titanium center, the sulfur compound competes for dative coordination on the titanium center prior to the sulfur compound reacting with titanium oxygen double bonded moiety to form the sulfur oxide intermediate. One feature of the catalyst is that it includes latently coordinated hydroxyl moieties from the ligands that stabilize the titanium oxidation state such that sulfur competes against the latently coordinated hydroxyls. It is presently believed that the selectivity of the catalyst is dictated by the strength of that hydroxyl to titanium coordination environment.<br>
[000109]        While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently believed that the most advantageous results of the present disclosure are achieved according to the reaction mechanism illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
[000110]        It is presently believed that organosulfur oxidation occurs in two reaction steps. In the first step, the sulfur compound may irreversibly react with the catalyst and oxidant to form a sulfoxide. The sulfoxide may further be at with the catalyst and oxidant to form sulfur. The<br><br>
rate of formation of sulfoxide appears to be slower than the rate of formation of the sulfone of the same molecule.<br>
[000111]        The kinetics data of Figure 12 using the catalyst of the present disclosure have shown that reactivity follows the order DBT&gt;BT&gt;MDBT&gt;DMDBT. This relative trend substantially differs from that described by PetroStar and also by Qian where they observe that sulfone formation follows the trend: DMDBT&gt;MDBT&gt;NBT&gt;DBT&gt;BT using prior art catalysts. Indeed, the reaction extent and sulfoxidation selectivity seem to indicate that the catalysts plays a unique role in the reaction mechanism, as described graphically in Figure 4. [000112]        In summery, Figure 4 illustrates one representative example of a titanium species catalyst 50, such as, for example, bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) or derivative solid titanium catalyst as described above in the present disclosure, that may be useful to remove sulphur species 52 and the like sulfur compounds, as defined in Figure 2, from petroleum products. The titanium species catalyst 50 reacts with sulfur compounds to form an intermediate state 56. During this reaction, the oxygen atom attached to the titanium species catalyst 50 is transferred to the sulphur species 52 through a series of re-arrangement reaction steps at intermediate equilibrium state, 56, the oxidant is illustrated as entering the equilibrium state at 57 to form a new state at 58. The reaction continues through the state at 59 until the bond between the titanium species catalyst 50 and the sulphur species 52 and the byproduct species is broken resulting in the sulfoxide component 60 being freed or eliminated from being bound to the titanium species catalyst 50, regenerating titanium species catalyst 50. [000113]        The eliminated sulfoxide component 60 may then be recycled through the same exact reaction process cycle 62 and eventually has two oxygen atoms bound to the sulfoxide component 60, the second formed two oxygen atom sulfoxide component being illustrated at 64. Specifically, as shown on the left side of Figure 4, the sulfoxide component 60 may react in the presence of the titanium species catalyst 50 and may generate the equilibrium transition state 82. That equilibrium transition state 82 may further react with another equivalent of oxidant 57 and may form an intermediate transition state 86. The intermediate transition state 86 may further rearrange, regenerating the titanium species catalyst 50 in the form of titanium species catalyst 50 and producing the byproduct sulfone 64 and the oxidant byproduct 88. [000114]        The oxygen atoms of the titanium species catalyst 50 may be continually regenerated in a continuous cycle by the oxidant through the mechanism described above. At<br><br>
this point, it is believed that any material capable of transferring oxygen to the titanium species catalyst that allows the chemistry described to occur in the reaction cycle may function as an oxidant.<br>
Possible Embodiments of Heterogeneous Catalysts:<br>
[000115]        Titanyl catalysts bearing hydroxyl functionalities, that are not involved in chelation to the Ti center, are capable of undergoing reactions typical of free organic hydroxyl groups (Figure 5).<br>
[000116]        The enabling power of this capability markedly distinguishes the bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) composition catalyst from traditional titanate catalysts and compositions as demonstrated herein. The number of novel and unique compositions and enabling chemistries that can arise from the capability of bonding the catalyst to surfaces (Figure 6A-D) or embedding it in the backbone of polymers and copolymers (Figures 7 and 9) by reaction with bi-functional monomers makes the bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) catalyst a revolutionary advance in the chemistry of titanium.<br>
[000117]        Figure 5 illustrates various types of reaction chemistries that may convert the soluble form of the catalyst to a polymer bound insoluble form of the catalyst. Basically, the reactions illustrate multiple modes of enabling novel and unique compositions containing the titanyl moiety .<br>
[000118]        Figure 6A 1-3 illustrates several possible embodiments of surface bound titanium catalysts. As illustrated, the PS circle represents a substantially polystyrene sphere that may be purchased commercially. The polystyrene sphere may be purchased bearing isocyanate, acid chloride, benzyl chloride and other reactive functional groups capable of chemically bonding to the hydroxyl moiety of the catalyst producing a surface bound catalyst product. [000119]        Figure 6 also illustrates several surface bound catalytically active species in accordance with the present disclosure. One surface bound species illustrated is an isocyanate (6 A 1) functional polystyrene species that may react with the hydroxyl group of the catalyst to which may result in a surface bound catalytically active amide complex with the polystyrene bead. Figure 6 A2 illustrates the reaction of an acid halide functional polystyrene bead that may result in a surface bound catalytic active ester complex. Figure 6 A3 illustrates a benzylic halide surface bound species that may react with the hydroxyl group which may generate an ether-bound catalyst on the surface of a polystyrene bead.<br><br>
[000120]        Figures 6 B-C illustrate the utilization of a linker between the catalyst and the binding surface, with Figure 6D illustrating the catalyst being bound directly to a surface. [000121]        Representative linkers are illustrated in Figure 5 and may include, but are not limited to, isocyanates, acid halides, sulfonyl halides, benzyl halide and anhydrides and mixtures thereof.<br>
[000122]        Figure 7 illustrates a generalized structure of the polymeric catalyst of the present disclosure. The polymeric version of the catalyst contains a linking group. The linking group may be derived from a bi-functional chemical of the general formula, Q-R-Q’ wherein Q and Q’ are each independently chemical reactive groups that react with hydroxyl groups on the catalyst. Q and Q’ may comprise, for example, isocyanates, anhydrides, sulfonyl halides, benzyl halides, carboxylic acid halides, phosphoryl acid halides, silyl chlorides, or any chemical functionality capable of reacting with the -OH pendant group of the catalyst. A further component of the linking group is denoted by R wherein R may comprise alkyl groups (including linear, branched, saturated, unsaturated, cyclic, and substituted alkyl groups, and wherein hetero atoms, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, phosphorus, and the like can be present in the alkyl group), typically with from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms, preferably with from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably with from 1 to about 7 carbon atoms, although the number of carbon atoms can be outside of these ranges, aryl groups (including substituted aryl groups), typically with from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably with from about 6 to about 15 carbon atoms, and more preferably with from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, although the number of carbon atoms can be outside of these ranges, arylalkyl groups (including substituted arylalkyl groups), typically with from about 7 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably with from about 7 to about 15 carbon atoms, and more preferably with from about 7 to about 12 carbon atoms, although the number of carbon atoms can be outside of these ranges, such as benzyl or the like, alkylaryl groups (including substituted alkylaryl groups), typically with from about 7 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably with from about 7 to about 15 carbon atoms, and more preferably with from about 7 to about 12 carbon atoms, although the number of carbon atoms can be outside of these ranges, alkoxy groups (including substituted alkoxy groups, and wherein hetero atoms, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, phosphorus, and the like can be present in the alkoxy group), typically with from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms, preferably with from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably with from 1 to about 7 carbon atoms, although the number of carbon atoms can be outside of these ranges, polyalkyleneoxy groups (including substituted polyalkyleneoxy groups), such as polyethyleneoxy groups, polypropyleneoxy groups,<br><br>
polybutyleneoxy groups, and the like, typically with from about 3 to about 60 repeat alkyleneoxy units, preferably with from about 3 to about 30 repeat alkyleneoxy units, and more preferably with from about 3 to about 20 repeat alkyleneoxy units, although the number of repeat alkyleneoxy units can be outside of these ranges. The result of reacting the linking group and the catalyst produces a heterogeneous catalyst that may be described as an AB type co-polymer. If more than one type of linking group was employed, according to the present disclosure, the polymer catalyst produced may be described more generically as a co-polymer. [000123]        Figure 8 is a photograph of a specific embodiment of the polystyrene bound catalyst described in Figure 6 and also represents, in a generalized example, the types of surface bound and pore bound examples described in Figures 6B-D.<br>
[000124]        Figure 9 illustrates another generalized structure of the polymeric catalyst of the present disclosure. Figure 9 is a photograph of a particular polymeric catalyst of the present disclosure illustrating specific polymeric catalyst integrating with a bi-functional linker moiety, producing a highly cross-linked, solid polymeric catalyst, according to the present disclosure. [000125]        The following examples are the result of extensive experimentation evaluating the performance attributes of the heterogeneous variant of the bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) of the present disclosure. As the result of our extensive experimentation to date, we believe the sulfoxidation catalytic process integrating the catalytic composition of the present disclosure represents a cost effective, safe, reliable, and highly efficient method to reduce sulfur levels in transportation fuels.<br>
Possible Embodiments of Heterogeneous Catalysts Preparation [000126]        Experiments were conducted according to General Method H, as defined below. In some cases the catalyst from one experiment was washed, filtered, and re-used in further experiments.<br>
General Method H [000127]        Pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA, 2.18g, 0.01 moles) was suspended in 20ml of acetonitrile (or optionally DMSO depending upon solubility of PMDA and/or catalyst) in a 100ml glass bottle containing a magnetic stir bar spinning at a rate to sufficiently mix the components. Bis(glycerol)oxotitanium(IV) (2.58g, 0.0105 moles) was added with vigorous<br>
