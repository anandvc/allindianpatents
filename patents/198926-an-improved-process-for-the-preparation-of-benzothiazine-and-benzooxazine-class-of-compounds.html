Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of ant diabetic compounds having the formula (1).<br><br>
In our US Patent numbers 6,265,401 we have described a process for the preparation of free acid of arginine salt of formula (1). The process described therein comprises of converting aldehydes of formula (2) where X represents sulphuric or oxygen atom to a compound of formula (3) where R1 and R2 represent lower alkyl group, reducing the compound of formulae (3) to produce a compound of formula (4), hydrolyzing the compound of formula (4) to obtain an acid of formula (5), converting the acid of formula (5) to an amide of the formula (6) and hydrolyzing the amide to produce the compound of formula (7), where X and R are as defined above. The process is shown in the scheme -1 given below<br><br><br>
While developing the improved process we observed that the process for the preparation of the compounds of' the formula (1) as disclosed in our above referred patent involves :<br>
•	the use of exotic reactions like Witting-Homer reaction, which is' a moisture<br>
sensitive reaction, to prepare the  compound of the formula (3). Moisture sensitive<br>
reactions are difficult to handle in large scale manufacturing process.<br>
•	tedious reaction steps employing expensive, tedious and time- consuming column chromatographic methods<br>
•	the overall yield of the compounds of the formula (7) is only -2.5% and time cycle required for the completion of the reaction sequence resulting in the compounds of the formula (7) is very long which makes the process very expensive for commercial application .<br>
In our WO publication No 00/66572 we have described an alternate process for the preparation of compounds of formula (1). The process described therein comprises the condensation of compound of the formula (9) where R and R are as described therein, with mesylate of the formula (8) in the presence of solvents such as THF, DMF, DMSO, DME and the like or mixtures thereof and base such as K2CO3, Na2C03, NaH and the like or mixtures thereof to produce ester of formula (10) and hydrolyzing the compound of the formula (10) by conventional methods to yield the compound of the formula (11) where R' is as described therein, reacting the compound of formula (10) with arginine to produce arginine salt of compound of formula (1). The reaction is shown in scheme-2 below :<br><br><br>
The process has the following disadvantages:<br>
•	The condensation of mesylate with compound of formula (9) in DMF and<br>
potassium carbonate results into highly impure product, which could not be purified<br>
by conventional methods like distillation	'<br>
•	Column chromatography was employed for purification of the product, which is<br>
difficult to practice in scale up trials.<br>
•	DMF is used as medium, the recovery and recycling of DMF in bulk quantities<br>
poses a problem as it absorbs moisture and decomposes during distillation.<br>
Objecth'es of the present invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide a convergent synthesis of the compounds of the formula (1), without employing exotic and expensive chemicals, thereby making the process commercially viable.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple and efficient process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (1), which would be friendly to a manufacturing chemist v/ith simple and safe operations even in scale up of the process for commercial applications.<br>
