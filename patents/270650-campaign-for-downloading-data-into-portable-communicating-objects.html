	A campaign for downloading data into portable<br>
	communicating objects<br>
		The present invention relates to downloading data<br>
15 from a server into portable communicating objects<br>
	through a radiocommunications network. In particular,<br>
	the communicating objects are smart cards, such as<br>
	Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards, inserted into<br>
	mobile terminals of the radiocommunications network.<br>
20 		The data download server or "Over The Air (OTA)<br>
	card administration platform" has software that enables<br>
	the operator managing the radiocommunications network<br>
	to keep control over the smart cards in the mobile<br>
	terminals and to modify the contents of said cards.<br>
25 	Such operations which are performed at the initiative<br>
	of the operator (push mode) concern, for example,<br>
	downloading a file into predetermined cards of the<br>
	fleet managed by the operator, or downloading or<br>
	deleting a determined application, or indeed modifying<br>
30 	data in a file or a determined application in cards<br>
	managed by the operator.<br><br><br>
2<br>
		The data to be downloaded into the smart cards is<br>
	often transmitted through a short message server. A<br>
	plurality of short messages are often necessary in<br>
	order to download an application or a file.<br>
5 		The invention relates more particularly to a<br>
	campaign for downloading data for the purpose of<br>
	massively updating user cards, even though the OTA data<br>
	download server can effect individual downloading into<br>
	a single user card.<br>
10 		In a first example, such individual downloading<br>
	relates to a unique personal file that is intended for<br>
	roaming users who travel abroad frequently and that<br>
	contains more than about ten identifiers of preferred<br>
	networks managed by operators with whom the operator of<br>
15 	the network managing the cards has entered into<br>
	contracts. The preferred network identifier file is<br>
	unique and is to be downloaded into numerous<br>
	predetermined cards so that the users of those cards<br>
	can use it when they travel abroad.<br>
20 		For this first example, the operator currently<br>
	has two possibilities for downloading the file from the<br>
	OTA server. In a first possibility, the operator<br>
	decides to download the file individually, as and when<br>
	such a file becomes necessary, i.e. the first time an<br>
25 interested user goes roaming, and so on, one after<br>
	another, for all of the users who go roaming. In a<br>
	"campaign mode" second possibility, the server sends<br>
	the preferred network identifier file in a single<br>
	campaign to the cards whose users have taken out a<br>
30	subscription to a roaming option.<br><br><br>
3<br>
		In campaign mode, the number of users targeted<br>
	can be as high as several hundreds of thousands or<br>
	millions.<br>
		In a second example, individual downloading<br>
5	 relates to a unique file of names and telephone numbers<br>
	of sales representatives of a firm to be downloaded<br>
	into the cards of the users employed in the firm.<br>
		In a third example, individual downloading<br>
	relates to an application facilitating management of<br>
10 	the phonebooks of telephone numbers in the SIM cards.<br>
	The application enables a user to back up his or her<br>
	entire phonebook in a predetermined server managed by<br>
	the operator every time the user records a new<br>
	telephone number in his or her card;<br>
15 		In the third example, three possibilities are<br>
	offered. After seeing a television commercial, the<br>
	user calls the call center of the operator during the<br>
	day in order to ask for the application to be<br>
	downloaded into his or her SIM card. This operation is<br>
20 	an individual operation triggered in the OTA server by<br>
	the operator in customer care mode. In a second<br>
	possibility, the user takes the initiative of ordering<br>
	downloads (pull mode) by consulting the operator's site<br>
	himself or herself from his or her mobile terminal so<br>
25 	as to trigger downloading of the application into the<br>
	SIM card. This downloading is also an individual<br>
	operation controlled in the OTA server by the user in<br>
	the Self Care mode. In a third possibility, the<br>
	operator triggers an operation for downloading in<br>
30 	campaign mode to more than one million targeted users<br>
	so that the OTA server administrates the downloading of<br>
	the application into the one million SIM cards.<br><br><br>
4<br>
		It appears that campaign mode has technical<br>
	complexity that is considerably greater than the<br>
	technical complexity of individual mode since campaign<br>
	mode consists in repeating the individual operations<br>
5	for a very large number of cards, while complying with<br>
	constraints concerning short message rate and campaign<br>
	length, and also concerning monitoring the progress of<br>
	the campaign.<br>
		Since the download campaign is very long, an<br>
10 	operator always seeks to reduce the time for which a<br>
	card is locked during the campaign in order not to<br>
	prevent access for too long to the card for individual<br>
	operations triggered, in particular, by the user of the<br>
	card. Therefore, the number of campaigns and their<br>
15 	lengths are fundamental elements that are imposed on<br>
	operation of the OTA download server.<br>
		In accompanying Figure 1, elements of data<br>
	processing phases for downloading predetermined data<br>
	into N user smart cards Cl to CN in mobile terminals<br>
20 	from the OTA download server are indicated in the form<br>
	of blocks, each of which comprises three elements of<br>
	processing. Each block concerns downloading, via a<br>
	short message, into a respective smart card Cn, where n<br>
	is such that 1 ≤ n ≤ N. A first element of processing<br>
25 	PRE relates to pre-processing data to be formatted into<br>
	a data message to be transmitted to the smart card Cn.<br>
	The second element of processing T/R extends from<br>
	transmission by the server of the formatted data<br>
	message to reception by the server of the<br>
30 	acknowledgment transmitted by the smart card Cn. The<br>
	third element of processing is post-processing POST<br>
	during which the server analyzes the received<br><br><br>
5 		5<br>
	acknowledgement and stores any data contained in the<br>
	acknowledgement so as to record said data in a database<br>
	in correspondence with a number of the smart card Cn.<br>
		At the beginning of the campaign, the server<br>
5	successively transmits prepared messages of formatted<br>
	data to the first cards Cl, C2, C3, ... targeted by the<br>
	campaign, and immediately analyzes the acknowledgement<br>
	of each of the messages of data transmitted in this<br>
	way. Since an acknowledgement implicitly indicates<br>
10 	that the mobile terminal of the user is in a state to<br>
	receive and to process a previously transmitted data<br>
	message, the server transmits another prepared message<br>
	of formatted data after the post-processing POST of an<br>
	acknowledgement that has just been transmitted by the<br>
15 	user card. A succession of two sets, each comprising<br>
	three elements of processing, is indicated relative to<br>
	the cards Cl and C3 in Figure 1.<br>
		The campaign ends when all of the expected<br>
	acknowledgements of the transmitted data messages have<br>
20 	been processed. However, certain acknowledgements will<br>
	never be transmitted by user cards when mobile<br>
	terminals including them are not connected to the<br>
	radiocommunications network during the campaign, or, in<br>
	particular, when the short message server and/or when<br>
25 the radiocommunications network has/have lost one or<br>
	more messages of formatted data whose destination is a<br>
	smart card. The last block in Figure 1 is associated<br>
	with a last card Cd which can be any card targeted by<br>
	the campaign, and, a priori, different from the card<br>
30 	CN.<br>
		As a result of the process of the elements of<br>
	processing during the campaign, the length of the<br><br><br>
6<br>
	campaign depends on the number of messages of formatted<br>
	data and thus on the number of short messages to be<br>
	transmitted and on the number of smart cards targeted<br>
	during the campaign. The length of time of the<br>
5	campaign offered through the short message server thus<br>
	depends on the length of time of the three elements of<br>
	processing PRE, T/R, and POST and on how the blocks of<br>
	three elements of processing shown in Figure 1 follow<br>
	on from one another for downloading into each card.<br>
10	The download suffer from the drawback of<br>
	requiring a long campaign length because they depend on<br>
	a plurality of successive sets of three elements of<br>
	processing for each targeted card. Under such<br>
	conditions, the short message server is busy for a very<br>
15 	long time and lacks availability for transmitting and<br>
	receiving short messages interchanged between the users<br>
	and short messages for other campaigns.<br>
		In addition, the download server has to manage a<br>
	plurality of types of processing at the same time,<br>
20 	which slows its execution speed down and therefore<br>
	increases the length of the campaign. For a<br>
	predetermined rate of short messages offered by the<br>
	short message server to the download server, and with<br>
	the servers having equal execution performance, the<br>
25 	download server cannot achieve that rate because of the<br>
	correlation of the intermediate transmit/receive T/R<br>
	processing with the pre-processing PRE and the post-<br>
	processing POST for each data message during the<br>
	campaign.<br>
30 		An object of the invention is to remedy the<br>
	above-mentioned drawbacks of the organization of the<br>
	elements of processing in the download server during a<br><br><br>
7<br>
	campaign in order to load a larger number of cards for<br>
	a given campaign length and in order to use the<br>
	download server more efficiently for the various<br>
	elements of processing.<br>
5 		In order to achieve that object, a method for<br>
	downloading data from a server into portable<br>
	communicating objects through a radiocommunications<br>
	network, the downloading of data relating to a<br>
	communicating object comprising data pre-processing in<br>
10 	the server means for pre-processing data into at least<br>
	one data message whose destination is the communicating<br>
	object, transmission of the data message from the<br>
	server means to the communicating object, and reception<br>
	by the server means of an acknowledgment transmitted by<br>
15 	the communicating object, and data post-processing in<br>
	the server depending on the acknowledgement, is<br>
	characterized in that the data pre-processing phases<br>
	and the data post-processing phases relating to the<br>
	communicating objects are executed respectively before<br>
20 	and after the transmissions of data messages and the<br>
	reception of acknowledgements relating to the<br>
	communicating objects, and the server means<br>
	communicates with the radiocommunications network only<br>
	during the transmissions of message data and during the<br>
25 	receptions of acknowledgements.<br>
		In other words, the server means do not<br>
	communicate with the radiocommunications network during<br>
	the data pre-processing and data post-processing<br>
	relating to the communicating objects.<br>
30		In practice, the data messages and the<br>
	acknowledgements can, be respectively transmitted and<br>
	received by the server means through a communications<br><br>
8<br>
	gateway, such as, for example, a short message server,<br>
	during at least one predetermined time range and with a<br>
	maximum rate dependent on operation of the<br>
	communications gateway.<br>
5 		In accordance with the invention, all of the data<br>
	pre-processing elements are executed during a pre-<br>
	processing phase without the server means communicating<br>
	with the radiocommunications network. By grouping<br>
	together the pre-processing elements, the server means<br>
10 	make optimum use of their resources because they are<br>
	constrained to execute the same type of processing<br>
	element. The same applies to the data post-processing<br>
	elements that are executed together during a post-<br>
	processing phase during which the server means are not<br>
15 	communicating with the radiocommunications network.<br>
	During the post-processing, the database included in<br>
	the server means and used for recording, in particular,<br>
	updated images of the contents of the communicating<br>
	objects, such as smart cards, has its resources managed<br>
20 	much better than when the server means have to execute<br>
	pre-processing and post-processing at the same time as<br>
	data transmissions/receptions.<br>
		Advantageously, this technological break with the<br>
	prior art enables the resources of the server means to<br>
25 devote themselves entirely to transmitting and<br>
	receiving data while the server means are communicating<br>
	with the radiocommunications network, e.g. through a<br>
	communications gateway such as a short message server.<br>
	The ranges of hours imposed by operation of the<br>
30 communications gateway are occupied solely by<br>
	communications in the server means, i.e. by<br>
	transmitting formatted data messages and by receiving<br><br>
9<br>
	cknowledgements. For a given time range, the number<br>
	of data messages transmitted using the method for<br>
	downloading of the invention is much higher, and the<br>
	speed of operation of the server means is thus better<br>
5	adapted to the rate offered by the short message server<br>
	during each time range. Conversely, for a given number<br>
	of data messages, the necessary resources of the server<br>
	means are reduced by the method for downloading of the<br>
	invention. Therefore, for the same length of campaign,<br>
10 	and for the same amount of resources in the server<br>
	means, the invention downloads to a higher number of<br>
	cards than prior art methods do. The operator of the<br>
	radiocommunications network also reduces the time spent<br>
	monitoring the progress of the campaign.<br>
15 		Preparing data in advance during the pre-<br>
	processing phase offers the possibility of optimizing<br>
	the data pre-processing. According to an advantageous<br>
	characteristic of the invention, the data pre-<br>
	processing relating to communicating objects that have<br>
20 	at least one common characteristic has a common portion<br>
	executed once only before the transmissions of data<br>
	messages and the receptions of acknowledgements. This<br>
	characteristic optimizes the use of the resources of<br>
	the server means and therefore optimizes the length of<br>
25 	time taken by the data pre-processing.<br>
		With the same concern to optimize the resources<br>
	of the server means, the length of time of the post-<br>
	processing phase can be reduced by seeking common<br>
	characteristics of the communicating objects. In which<br>
30	case, the data post-processing relating to<br>
	communicating objects that have at least one common<br>
	characteristic has a common portion executed once only<br><br><br>
10 		10<br>
	after the transmissions of data messages and the<br>
	receptions of acknowledgements.<br>
		Thus the decorrelation of the three elements of<br>
	processing in accordance with the invention and<br>
5	 therefore the gathering together of the three types of<br>
	processing elements into three distinct phases, and the<br>
	factorization of certain operations by batches of cards<br>
	during the pre-processing and post-processing phases<br>
	optimize the speed of processing of the server means<br>
10 	and facilitate an increase in the rate of the data to<br>
	be transmitted during a campaign of predetermined<br>
	length. Conversely, for a given campaign length, the<br>
	amount of resources required of the server means of the<br>
	invention is smaller than the amount of resources<br>
15 	necessary for the prior art.<br>
		The present invention also provides a download<br>
	server for downloading data into portable communicating<br>
	objects of mobile terminals through a<br>
	radiocommunications network. According to the<br>
20 invention, the download server includes a pre-<br>
	processing module for pre-processing data into data<br>
	messages whose destinations are respective ones of the<br>
	communicating objects while the server is not<br>
	communicating with the radiocommunications network, a<br>
25 transmit-receive module for transmitting the data<br>
	messages to communicating objects and for receiving<br>
	acknowledgements transmitted by the communicating<br>
	objects through the radiocommunications network in<br>
	response to the data messages, and a post-processing<br>
30 	module for post-processing data in the server depending<br>
	on the received acknowledgements while the server is<br>
	not communicating with the radiocommunications network.<br><br>
11<br>
		The invention also provides a computer program on<br>
	an information medium, said computer program including<br>
	program instructions adapted to implementing a method<br>
	for the invention for downloading data from server<br>
5	means into portable communicating objects through the<br>
	radiocommunications network when said program is loaded<br>
	and executed in the server means. According to the<br>
	invention, the program includes pre-processing<br>
	instructions for pre-processing data into data messages<br>
10 whose destinations are respective ones of the<br>
	communicating objects while the server means are not<br>
	communicating with the radiocommunications network,<br>
	transmit-receive instructions for transmitting the data<br>
	messages to the communicating objects and for receiving<br>
15 acknowledgements transmitted by the communicating<br>
	objects through the radiocommunications network in<br>
	response to the data messages, and post-processing<br>
	instructions for post-processing data in the server<br>
	means depending on the received acknowledgements while<br>
20 the server means are not communicating with the<br>
	radiocommunications network.<br>
		Other characteristics and advantages of the<br>
	present invention appear more clearly on reading the<br>
	following description of various preferred embodiments<br>
25 	of the invention, given by way of non-limiting example<br>
	and with reference to the corresponding accompanying<br>
	drawings, in which:<br>

	steps of a prior art method for downloading data into<br>
30 	smart cards, and is referred to above;<br>

	of a method for the invention for downloading data; and<br>
		• Figure 4 shows main fields of a message<br>
	transmitted or received in a second implementation of<br>
	the invention.<br>
10 		Figure 2 shows main means for downloading data<br>
	into removable user smart cards Cl to CN that equip<br>
	respective ones of the mobile radio terminals Tl to TN<br>
	attached to a digital cellular radiocommunications<br>
	network RR. The smart card Cn in the mobile terminal<br>
15 	Tn with n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ N, is of the Universal<br>
	Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) type. For example, the<br>
	smart card is a SIM card when the network RR is of the<br>
	Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) type, or<br>
	a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) when the<br>
20 	network RR is a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)<br>
	network of the Third Generation Partnership Project<br>
	(3GPP) type, of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
	System (UMTS) type.<br>
		A card administration server SAC of the invention<br>
25 	is managed by the operator of the network RR and<br>
	constitutes an OTA platform. In the implementation<br>
	shown in Figure 2 to which reference is made below, the<br>
	server SAC transmits messages of formatted data MD to<br>
	the mobile terminals Tl to TN and receives messages of<br>
30 	acknowledgement AC transmitted by the mobile terminals<br>
	Tl to TN, via a communications gateway such as a short<br>
	message server or "Short Message Service Center" (SMSC)<br><br><br>
13<br>
	SC. The server SC has an access gateway for<br>
	communicating with the server SAC via a high-speed<br>
	packet network RP, such as the Internet, or such as an<br>
	intranet specific to the operator of the network RR.<br>
5	Another access gateway of the short message server SC<br>
	communicates with at least one switching center or<br>
	exchange of the mobile service, often through an access<br>
	network such as a packet network of the X.25 type or an<br>
	Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or an<br>
10 	Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. The data<br>
	messages MD are transported in Internet Protocol (IP)<br>
	packets by the server SAC, and they are formatted in<br>
	the server SC into short messages SM transmitted to the<br>
	mobile terminals; conversely, acknowledgement messages<br>
15 	AC are transmitted in short messages SM by a mobile<br>
	terminal Tn, the destination of which messages is the<br>
	server SAC, and said acknowledgement messages are<br>
	routed by the server SC in the form of IP packets to<br>
	the server SAC.<br>
20 		In a variant, the short message server SC is<br>
	connected directly to or is incorporated in a switching<br>
	center or exchange of the mobile service in the network<br>
	RR.<br>
		The invention is not limited to short messages SM<br>
25 	as vectors for carrying the data to be transmitted.<br>
	The server SC can be a Multimedia Messaging Service<br>
	(MMS) message server for multimedia files and<br>
	applications to be downloaded from the server SAC.<br>
		In another implementation, the short message<br>
30 server is replaced with an access network of the packet<br>
	switching network type with mobility being managed and<br>
	with access being by radio and that is a General Packet<br><br><br>
14<br>
	Radio Service (GPRS) network, if the<br>
	radiocommunications network RR is of the GSM type. A<br>
	Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) of the GPRS network is<br>
	connected to at least one base station controller of<br>
5	 the network RR. A Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) of<br>
	the GPRS network is connected to the packet network RP<br>
	serving the server SAC.<br>
		In a variant, if the radiocommunications network<br>
	RR is of the UMTS type, or of the GSM type back-to-back<br>
10 with a GPRS network, the messages MD and AC are<br>
	interchanged between a mobile terminal Tn and the<br>
	associated card Cn using the Bearer Independent<br>
	Protocol (BIP) or the Java 2 Mobile Edition (J2ME)<br>
	protocol.<br>
15 		As shown in Figure 2, the card administration<br>
	server SAC is connected to a database BD including<br>
	various parameters and characteristics of the cards<br>
	managed by the operator of the radiocommunications<br>
	network RR.<br>
20 		Each smart card Cn is associated with a table TCn<br>
	in the database BD. The table TCn contains, in<br>
	particular, initial characteristics which are related<br>
	to the identity of the card Cn and to the type of the<br>
	card and which are recorded in the database BD as soon<br>
25 	as the card is brought into service. These initial<br>
	characteristics are, in particular, a serial number of<br>
	the card, the International Mobile Subscriber Identity<br>
	(IMSI) of the user of the card, and the telephone<br>
	number of the Mobile Station ISDN (MSISDN) Number. The<br>
30 	type of the card Cn is defined in particular by an<br>
	identifier of the type of the processor included in the<br>
	card, the identifier of the manufacturer of the card,<br><br><br>
15		15<br>
	the number of bits per word processed by the processor,<br>
	the characteristics of the operating system and of the<br>
	virtual machine that are implemented in the card, etc.<br>
		Other characteristics specific to use of the card<br>
5	 and in particular of the user terminal Tn can also be<br>
	recorded in the table TCn associated with the card Cn<br>
	when the card is brought into service, and they can be<br>
	modified during use of the card. Such other<br>
	characteristics concern, in particular, the<br>
10 	subscription profile of the user of the card Cn, data<br>
	that can be modified by the user or by the operator<br>
	managing the card such as a phone and address book of<br>
	telephone numbers and of email addresses, and, for<br>
	example, a file of identifiers of Preferred Public Land<br>
15 	Mobile Networks (PPLMNs). The networks identified in<br>
	the PPLMN file are managed by operators with whom the<br>
	operator of the network RR to which the card Cn is<br>
	attached has entered into agreements so that the user<br>
	of the card Cn communicates through said networks when<br>
20 	the user is traveling through areas covered by said<br>
	networks.<br>
		The table TCn also contains one or more<br>
	identifiers of applications that are downloaded when<br>
	the smart card Cn is brought into service or that are<br>
25 	downloaded subsequently to the bringing into service of<br>
	said card. For example, one application consists in<br>
	modifying the file of PPLMN identifiers. In another<br>
	example, the application consists in deleting an<br>
	application from the card Cn or in downloading an<br>
30 	application into said card, e.g. for the purpose of<br>
	facilitating management of the phonebook of telephone<br>
	numbers in the card Cn by making it possible for the<br><br><br>
16<br>
	user, every time said user records a new telephone<br>
	number in the card, to back up his or her entire<br>
	phonebook in a specific server managed by the operator<br>
	so that the user can retrieve his or her backed-up<br>
5	 phonebook when he or she loses the card Cn or changes<br>
	cards. Another application can serve to modify<br>
	parameters in an application that has already been<br>
	downloaded into the card Cn; e.g. the parameters to be<br>
	modified are an update of prices of credit re-load and<br>
10 	of call units when the user is a subscriber to a pre-<br>
	paid account.<br>
		The table TCn also contains parameters specific<br>
	to administration of the card Cn. These administration<br>
	parameters are, in particular, an indicator of access<br>
15 	of the card Cn that gives information about operation<br>
	of the card Cn during one of three data download method<br>
	phases PI, P2, and P3 that are defined below, and a<br>
	synchronization word or "synchronization counter"<br>
	transmitted in a formatted data message MD by the<br>
20 	server SAC, and whose destination is the card Cn.<br>
		The database BD also contains one or more<br>
	campaign tables TCA that are assigned to respective<br>
	ones of campaigns. Each campaign table includes a list<br>
	of the MSISDN telephone numbers and of the.addresses of<br>
25 	the tables associated with the cards targeted by the<br>
	campaign, which cards are assumed below to be the N<br>
	cards Cl to CN, and the hours during which the campaign<br>
	is to be conducted.<br>
		The data base BD can be incorporated into the<br>
30 card administration server SAC, or it can be<br>
	independent in the form of a database management server<br>
	that is connected to the server SAC via a packet<br><br><br>
17<br>
	network such as the network RP, i.e. via the Internet<br>
	or via an intranet network specific to the operator of<br>
	the network RR.<br>
		As shown in detail in Figure 2, the card<br>
5	administration server SAC has three software modules<br>
	MA, M2, and M3 for executing respective ones of the<br>
	three main phases Pi, P2, and P3 of the invention for<br>
	downloading of the data, under the control of a manager<br>
	module GE that manages the various operations during<br>
10 	the downloading, as in the timing diagram shown in<br>
	Figure 3 and described below.<br>
		The invention thus relates not only to a method<br>
	for downloading data that is implemented in server<br>
	means such as the administration server SAC and the<br>
15 	database BD, but also to an implementation of steps of<br>
	the method for downloading data into portable<br>
	communicating objects such as smart cards or mobile<br>
	terminals, the steps being determined by the<br>
	instructions of a data download program incorporated in<br>
20 	the server means SAC-BD. The method for the invention<br>
	is then implemented when the program is loaded into a<br>
	computer, such as the server means SAC-BD, whose<br>
	operation is then controlled by execution of the<br>
	program. The invention thus applies to a computer<br>
25 	program that is recorded on or in any medium or means<br>
	or circuit for storing information, based on any<br>
	programming language, e.g. a high-level language such<br>
	as Java, and compiled in executable codes that are<br>
	adapted to implementing the method for the invention in<br>
30 	the computer such as the server means SAC-BD.<br>
		It is assumed that a predetermined time range and<br>
	a predetermined rate for short messages SM are made<br><br>
18<br>
	available in the short message server SC for the<br>
	campaign that is to be launched by the operator of the<br>
	radiocommunications network RR managing the short<br>
	message server SC. The predetermined time range is,<br>
5	for example, a daytime range from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. five<br>
	days a week, in order to receive the larger number of<br>
	acknowledgement messages from the users who are<br>
	available during said time range, compared with a<br>
	nighttime time range. In a variant, the time range is<br>
10 	24 hours a day for a predetermined period.<br>
		As shown in Figure 3, the campaign is subdivided<br>
	into three phases PI, P2, and P3, only the<br>
	"transmit/receive" intermediate phase P2 taking place<br>
	during the predetermined time range so as to use that<br>
15 	time range for message transmission and reception only.<br>
		Therefore, in the invention, the data pre-<br>
	processing phase PI and the data post-processing phase<br>
	P3 are performed respectively before and after the<br>
	transmissions of data messages MD and the receptions<br>
20 	acknowledgement messages AC for all of the smart cards<br>
	Cl to CN to which messages are to be transmitted during<br>
	the predetermined time range. The card administration<br>
	server SAC thus does not communicate with the short<br>
	message server SC during the phases PI and P3 and thus<br>
25 	does not have access to the radiocommunications network<br>
	RR during those phases.<br>
		By way of example, the number N of smart cards to<br>
	be reached during a campaign can be in the range<br>
	several hundreds of thousands to a few million. The<br>
30 	number of short messages to be transmitted to a card<br>
	can be as high as a few tens, which corresponds to<br>
	several million or to several tens of millions of short<br><br><br>
19<br>
	messages to be transmitted during the campaign. The<br>
	predetermined rate of short messages SM can vary in the<br>
	range about ten short messages per second to about more<br>
	than one thousand short messages per second, a short<br>
5	 message comprising at the most 140 eight-bit bytes.<br>
		The manager GE initializes the campaign by<br>
	starting with the pre-processing phase Pi and activates<br>
	the pre-processing module Ml. The pre-processing<br>
	consists essentially in formatting the data to be<br>
10 	transmitted into data messages MD.<br>
		As shown in Figure 4, a data message MD whose<br>
	destination is the smart card Cn is made up of two<br>
	portions: namely a header ES that is specific to the<br>
	card Cn and a field CHD of data that can be at least<br>
15 	partially common to a plurality of smart cards targeted<br>
	by the campaign.<br>
		The header ES typically comprises a few eight-bit<br>
	bytes and, in particular contains security parameters<br>
	specific to the card Cn, such as signatures, e.g.<br>
20 	authentication signatures, and/or encryption elements,<br>
	the suffix of the MSISDN telephone number corresponding<br>
	to the card Cn, and a synchronization word. All of<br>
	these items of data are read from the table TCn<br>
	associated with the card Cn in the database BD so as to<br>
25 	include them in the header ES of the data message.<br>
		After the header ES has been generated, data<br>
	items to be downloaded into the card Cn, which data<br>
	items are of variable length, are often fragmented into<br>
	data fields CHD. Each data field CHD has a variable<br>
30 length indicated in the header ES. The data fields<br>
	contain data specific to the campaign, such as data for<br>
	updating a phonebook or an address book, or a list of<br><br><br>
20		20<br>
	preferred radiocommunications network identifiers, or<br>
	such as instructions of an application to be<br>
	downloaded.<br>
		The generated header ES and each data field CHD<br>
5	 are concatenated into a data message MD to be<br>
	transmitted, which data message is optionally encrypted<br>
	as a function of a key that is personal to the card Cn.<br>
	The data message MD is packeted into an IP message<br>
	whose header EIP contains the address of the server SAC<br>
10 	as source, the address of the server SC as destination,<br>
	the length of the IP packet, etc. The module Ml<br>
	formats the data firstly for the first card Cl, then<br>
	successively for the cards C2 to CN. The packets IP<br>
	(MD) constructed in this way are stored in a buffer<br>
15 	memory of the First In First Out (FIFO) type of the<br>
	server SAC pending transmission of them during the next<br>
	phase P2.<br>
		Certain types of data pre-processing PRE relating<br>
	to cards having at least one common characteristic<br>
20 preferably have a common portion executed once only<br>
	during the phase Pi preceding message transmission<br>
	during phase P2. Thus, during phase PI, the manager<br>
	module GE sorts the cards Cl to CN targeted by the<br>
	campaign as a function of common characteristics that<br>
25 	it can read from the tables TCI to TCN. Such common<br>
	characteristics can depend, in particular on the type<br>
	of the card, and thus on the identifier of the<br>
	manufacturer of the card, and on the type of user and<br>
	thus, in particular, on the user profile.<br>
30 		For example, when the module Ml is to establish a<br>
	command to be transmitted in the data fields CHD of<br>
	messages MD, the command is established once only for<br><br><br>
21<br>
	all of the cards coming from the same manufacturer and<br>
	having the same processor. Such pre-processing is<br>
	validated or invalidated for all of the cards in<br>
	question. Compared with prior art techniques, grouping<br>
5	 identical pre-processing or identical portions of pre-<br>
	processing together in common pre-processing<br>
	advantageously reduces the time for which the server<br>
	SAC operates and thus makes it available for other<br>
	tasks.<br>
10 		In another example, determined message formatting<br>
	is common to all of the messages MD in which the length<br>
	of the data field is identical and in which the<br>
	security characteristics inserted into the header and<br>
	required for that formatting satisfy predetermined<br>
15 	conditions.<br>
		In yet another example, when the campaign aims to<br>
	change a portion of contents in the cards, the database<br>
	BD prepares data to be transmitted for cards targeted<br>
	by the campaign in an operation that is identical for<br>
20 	all of the cards that present the same subscription<br>
	profile; this pre-processing is executed only once per<br>
	profile for all of the cards having common profile<br>
	characteristics so as to re-use the result obtained<br>
	with the first card for the following cards.<br>
25 		The transmit/receive phase P2 is executed by the<br>
	module M2 via a communications interface IC included in<br>
	the server SAC, throughout the time range imposed by<br>
	the operator managing the short message server SC. In<br>
	Figure 3, the transmit/receive block T/R extends from<br>
30 	the beginning of transmission of a message of formatted<br>
	data IP (MD) by the server SAC until the end of<br>
	reception in the server SAC of an acknowledgement<br><br>
22<br>
	transmitted by the smart card Cn in response to the<br>
	message IP (MD).<br>
		Under the control of the manager GE, the<br>
	transmit/receive module M2 transmits the messages IP<br>
5	(MD) prepared during the preceding pre-processing phase<br>
	PI to the short message server SC, by starting by<br>
	transmitting the first messages relating to the first<br>
	cards, and then by giving priority to transmitting the<br>
	messages relating to the cards for which the<br>
10 acknowledgement messages AC relating to previously<br>
	transmitted data messages have been received by the<br>
	module M2. For example, as shown in Figure 3, the<br>
	first messages relating to the cards Cl to C(n+1) are<br>
	transmitted, then a second message relating to the<br>
15 	second card C2 is transmitted after receiving the first<br>
	acknowledgement message relating to the card C2.<br>
		The transmit/receive phase P2 can be finished<br>
	when an acknowledgement message AC corresponding to the<br>
	last data message MD prepared during the phase PI is<br>
20 	received, or naturally when the time allocated by the<br>
	operator for the phase P2 expires. As indicated in<br>
	Figure 3, said last message can relate to any targeted<br>
	card Cd of the campaign. In practice, the time that<br>
	elapses between the beginning of transmission E of a<br>
25 	data message MD and the end of reception R of an<br>
	acknowledgement message AC, which time is illustrated<br>
	by the length of a T/R block in Figure 3, varies as a<br>
	function of the availabilities of the networks RP and<br>
	RR and of the server SC through which the messages<br>
30 	pass, and, above all, as a function of the state of the<br>
	mobile terminal containing the smart card that is the<br>
	destination of the data message. The mobile terminal<br><br><br>
23<br>
	can be on standby, or busy, or switched off, or outside<br>
	the network coverage. The length of a T/R phase<br>
	element is, in practice, limited to a few tens of<br>
	minutes, and the module M2 reiterates transmission of a<br>
5	data message MD for which it has not received an<br>
	acknowledgement AC a plurality of times, e.g. two or<br>
	three times. Each time that the module M2 has not<br>
	received an acknowledgement message in reply to a data<br>
	message, the module M2 re-transmits the data messages<br>
10 	whose destination is the card in question starting from<br>
	the first message. After a plurality of attempts that<br>
	are spaced apart in time to various extents have been<br>
	made to transmit a data message to a card Cn and have<br>
	failed, the module M2 permanently abandons transmission<br>
15 	of the data messages MD for the card Cn in question.<br>
		The packets IP(AC) transmitted by the short<br>
	message server SC are unpacketed into acknowledgement<br>
	messages that are optionally encrypted AC by the<br>
	communications interface IC. The optionally encrypted<br>
20 	acknowledgement messages AC are stored as they are<br>
	received in a buffer memory of the server SAC, pending<br>
	post-processing P3 by the module M3. Each<br>
	acknowledgement message AC has a format similar to the<br>
	format shown in Figure A and is made up of a header ES<br>
25 	that is specific to the associated card and that<br>
	relates to security and synchronization, and of a data<br>
	field CHD.<br>
		Once the last acknowledgement message AC is<br>
	received, or, at the latest, on expiry of the time<br>
30 	range allocated to the server SAC, the transmit/receive<br>
	phase P2 is considered to be finished and is followed<br>
	by the post-processing phase P3.<br><br>
24<br>
		During the post-processing phase P3, the post-<br>
	processing module M3 reads from the buffer memory and<br>
	analyzes the optionally decrypted acknowledgement<br>
	messages AC that were delivered by the smart cards Cl<br>
5	to CN through the mobile terminals Tl to TN and through<br>
	the short message server SC in response to respective<br>
	ones of the formatted data messages MD. For example,<br>
	an acknowledgement message AC acknowledges downloading<br>
	of data or of instructions from an application into the<br>
10	associated card, or acknowledges execution of a command<br>
	that has succeeded or that has failed in the associated<br>
	card.<br>
		The module M3 updates and analyzes the<br>
	synchronization words (Sync) and the "images" of the<br>
15	contents of the cards Cl to CN in the tables TCI to TCN<br>
	of the database BD, in response to the acknowledgement<br>
	messages relating to the cards. The contents of the<br>
	card Cn in the table TCn are updated by the module M3<br>
	when all of the data messages concerning said updating<br>
20	 have been acknowledged by messages AC so that the<br>
	contents of the table TCn reflect the contents of the<br>
	card Cn and are thus the image of said contents of the<br>
	card.<br>
		In a manner similar to the manner of the pre-<br>
25	processing phase PI, the module M3 executes data post-<br>
	processing POST relating to batches of cards, each<br>
	batch of cards resulting from prior sorting of the<br>
	cards, and relating to cards having one or more common<br>
	characteristics. Therefore, the post-processing module<br>
30	M3 executes once only a common portion of data pre-<br>
	processing relating to smart cards that have at least<br>
	one common characteristic. For example, all of the<br><br><br>
25		25<br>
	cards that have a portion of their subscription<br>
	profiles in common have a portion of their contents<br>
	that is updated in their respective tables TCI to TCN<br>
	after a common preparation of the updating of the<br>
5	profile during the pre-processing phase PI.<br>
		Although the downloading method is described with<br>
	reference to three phases PI, P2 and P3 that are<br>
	completely separate as shown in Figure 3, pre-<br>
	processing and post-processing phases can be mixed.<br>
10 	For example when a plurality of ranges of hours are<br>
	provided for a campaign, the card administration server<br>
	SAC executes the post-processing phase P3 relating to<br>
	analyzing the acknowledgement messages AC received<br>
	during the immediately preceding phase PI so as to<br>
15 	format data to be transmitted during a following<br>
	transmit/receive phase P2.<br>
		The invention is not limited to downloading data<br>
	into smart cards of the UICC type. A smart card into<br>
	which data is to be downloaded can also be a card<br>
20 	included in a laptop computer connected to a mobile<br>
	terminal, or a credit card, or any other additional<br>
	card included in a mobile terminal. In other variants,<br>
	the invention applies to other portable communicating<br>
	electronic objects, such as communicating Personal<br>
25 	Digital Assistants (PDAs). The invention applies even<br>
	to mobile terminals targeted by a campaign for which<br>
	the data to be downloaded can concern a game to be<br>
	recorded in the non volatile memories of the<br>
	Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory<br>
	(EEPROM) type of the mobile terminals.<br><br><br>

	dependent on the operation of the communications<br>
	gateway.<br>
		7- A download server (SAC) for downloading data<br>
	into portable communicating objects (Cl - CN) of mobile<br>
5 	terminals (Tl - TN) through a radiocommunications<br>
	network (RR), said download server being characterized<br>
	in that it includes a pre-processing module (Ml) for<br>
	pre-processing data into data messages whose<br>
	destinations are respective ones of the communicating<br>
10 	objects (Cl - CN) while the server is not communicating<br>
	with the radiocommunications network (RR), a transmit-<br>
	receive module (M2) for transmitting the data messages<br>
	to communicating objects and for receiving<br>
	acknowledgements transmitted by the communicating<br>
15 	objects through the radiocommunications network (RR) in<br>
	response to the data messages, and a post-processing<br>
	module (M3) for post-processing data in the server<br>
	depending on the received acknowledgements while the<br>
	server is not communicating with the<br>
20 	radiocommunications network (RR).<br>
		8- A server according to claim 7, characterized<br>
	in that the communicating objects are removable user<br>
	smart cards (Cl - CN) of mobile terminals (Tl - TN).<br>
		9. A server according to claim 7, characterized<br>
25	in that the communicating objects are mobile terminals<br>
	(Tl - TN).<br>
		10 - A computer program on an information medium,<br>
	said computer program including program instructions<br>
	adapted to implementing a method for downloading data<br>
30	from server means (SAC, BD) into portable communicating<br>
	objects (Cl - CN) through a radiocommunications network<br>
	(RR) when said program is loaded and executed in the<br><br><br>
29<br>
	server means, said program being characterized in that<br>
	it includes pre-processing instructions (Ml) for pre-<br>
	processing data into data messages whose destinations<br>
	are respective ones of the communicating objects (Cl -<br>
5	CN) while the server means are not communicating with<br>
	the radiocommunications network (RR), transmit-receive<br>
	instructions (M2) for transmitting the data messages to<br>
	the communicating objects and for receiving<br>
	acknowledgements transmitted by the communicating<br>
10	objects through the radiocommunications network (RR) in<br>
	response to the data messages, and post-processing<br>
	instructions (M3) for post-processing data in the<br>
	server means depending on the received acknowledgements<br>
	while the server means are not communicating with the<br>
15	radiocommunications network.<br><br>
The downloading of data from a server into one (Cn) of the portable<br>
communicating objects (Cl CN), such as chip cards or mobile terminals, over a radiocommunications network involves: a preprocessing of data (PRET) in the server<br>
into at least one data message intended for the communicating object; a sending (E)<br>
of the data message from the server to the communicating object; a reception (R) by<br>
the server of an acknowledgement of reception by the communicating object, and;<br>
a post-processing of data (POST) in the server contingent on the acknowledgement<br>
of reception. The pre-processings of data (P1) and post-processings of data (P3)<br>
concerning the communicating objects are respectively executed before and after<br>
sending the data message and receiving the acknowledgements of reception (P2)<br>
concerning the communicating objects. The server communicates with the radiocommunications network only during the sending and receiving of messages.<br></td>
