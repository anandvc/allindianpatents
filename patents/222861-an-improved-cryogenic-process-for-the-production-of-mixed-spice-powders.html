				<td>The present invention relates to an improved cryogenic process for the production of mixed spice powders, particularly the invention relates to a process which helps in higher retention of etheric oils, prevention of oxidation and rancidity, product with better sensory profile, increase in throughput and reduction in grinding power consumption, possibility to fine grind mixture of difficult -to- grind spices, and finer, uniform particle sizes of the mix.<br>
Spice mixes are indispensable in kitchens in individual homes and institutions, and in food manufacturing industries for providing individuality to otherwise insipid dishes and for adding tang and zest to beverages and serve as good appetizers. Those who buy and use spices casually are usually unaware or cannot believe that the ancient trade in spices shaped the course of early history.<br>
There was a time when spices were eagerly sought and the wealth and power of nations were involved in the control of the spice trade. Despite their economic importance in the world trade, they have not received the attention they so richly deserve, notably in their processing and quality aspects. Value added products such as spice mix powders, ground spices, oleoresins and spice oil extracts have vast industrial applications and with improvements in processing, could improve their share in the market.<br>
Reference may be made to Lowrison G.C. Crushing and Grinding. (London : Butterworths 1974) wherein it is reported that in most of the grinding operations the applied energy (&gt;99%) gets dissipated into heat. This is primarily due to the non-uniformity of the feed material in size, structure, defects, dislocation etc., so that an accurately judged application of force to all sample<br><br>
elements is not possible. Also the fracture process results in particles of varying size, needing unnecessarily large forces to get the product milled to a particular particle size. Further, due to various metering characteristics of different constituents of spice mix there tend to be clogging or clumping of some of the products inhibiting continuous production making conventional grinding not suitable for producing ground spice mix powders.<br>
Reference may be made to Pruthi JS. Spices and condiments: Chemistry, Microbiology, Technology. Advances in Food Research Supp. 4, Academic Press Inc., New York wherein it is reported that during conventional milling of spices, with no cooling of the mill and the product, the temperature increases to over to 90 degree C in most of the fast rotating mills. Since etheric oils have boiling points ranging from 50 degree C to 320 degree C, some of the precious components are lost due to conventional milling of different constituents of spice mix, resulting in low quality product. Also due to two stage grinding operations volatiles of heat sensitive products such as spices are lost and thus result in low quality product.<br>
Reference may be made to McKee LH, Thomson LD and Harden ML. Effect of three grinding methods on some properties of Nutmeg. Food Sci. Technol. 26 (1980) P. 121-125 wherein it is reported that when material to be ground contains high level of fat or oils (Nutmeg, clove, maces etc.,) they cause clogging of the mill affecting throughput and quality of the product. A high moisture content also gives problems in milling. In some cases it is possible to grind only after drying. High moisture content materials often tend to stick to the<br><br>
parts of the mill. The acceptable moisture content in practice varies from material to material.<br>
Reference may be made to Rich Norman I., and Martin D. Rich. Ready-to-eat molded meat product US Patent No. US 4287218 (1981), wherein the preparation of ready -to -eat molded meat product is reported. Whole pieces of injected and tumbled meat are layered into the bottom of a preformed old and covered with a mixture of ground meat. Alternatively, ground meat is mixed with additives and/or an emulsion and placed in the mold. The product is cooked under a vacuum finally. The major drawback here is there is no mentioning of method or composition of additives and/or an emulsion to be mixed with ground meat.<br>
Reference may be made to Byong W.Yoo Enhanced kimchi mix composition US Patent No. US6024992 (2000), wherein a composition of kimchi mix is reported. The kimchi mix has the composition of a spice mix, vitamin C and an organic acid. The spice mix comprised of salt, pepper powder, onion powder, garlic powder, mustard powder, paprika powder, kelp powder, fish powder, monosodium glutamate, sesame powder or mixtures thereof. The major drawback here is that only the product composition or formulation of the same is mentioned. Method of preparing as well as quality aspects of spice mix is not reported.<br>
Reference may be made to Kawachi Yoshihiro, Morioka Yuriko, Kami Akiko and Hisada Yoji. Spices used in feed for meat type poultry Japan Patent No. JP 7031382A2 (1994) wherein to obtain the spice mix which can increase<br><br>
the freshness of raw chicken and reduce the consumption of antibiotics by formulating spices inhibiting the proliferation of microorganisms on chicken meat is reported. The major draw back here is that only the spices such clove, mace, marjoram, mustard or the like which can inhibit microorganisms from growing on chicken, that are added to the feed for meat type chicken are mentioned and the method of preparing spice mix and related quality parameters are not reported.<br>
One of the popular spice mixes in India is the "garam masala", which primarily consists of Cinnamon sticks, cumin Seeds, coriander seeds, black pepper, bay Leaves and cloves. Various types of this mix are reported and practiced in India. Therefore, the reference to a 'spice mix powder1 in the invention includes within its scope, the Garam masala made in India.<br>
Reference may be made to Sridhar B.S. Jagmohan Rao J. and Kumar M.A. An improved process for the preparation of dry and fine spice powders Indian Patent No. 441/Del/2001 wherein to obtain the spice powders through cryogenic process is reported. The major draw back here is that only the process of producing individual spice powders such as clove, mace, marjoram, mustard or the like are mentioned and the method of preparing spice mix and related quality parameters are not reported.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop an improved cryogenic process for the production of mixed spice powders, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to produce a spice mix powder with high retention of etheric oils of the composite mix<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to produce a spice mix powder as an improved poultry feed that can impart meat and fat of the chicken an antibiotic action.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an inert atmosphere from the beginning to end of the grinding operation and for storage and package of ground product.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to obtain an increase in throughput and decrease in specific energy for grinding compared to conventional grinding.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to fine grind mixture of difficult spices.<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
In this example, data on grinding characteristics of spice mix powder obtained by the proposed process along with the quality and quantity of essential oil, particle size are given. The values are compared with and without water cooling process to show the viability of the process.<br>
Ten kg batch of mixture of spices constituting spice mix powder were ground using Hammer mill (Make:Cadmach Ahmedabad), having a provision for cold water circulation around the grinding zone. The percentage constituents of various spices of spice mix are given in Table 1. The circulation temperature of water during grinding was maintained at 4°C. A perforated round hole, woven wire mesh screen (Tylor series No.24) was used. Grinding operation was carried out with and without cold water circulation. The ground spice mix powder was<br>
packed and sealed immediately after grinding in aluminium foil-polythene laminate pouches and stored in the cold room at 4degree C for subsequent analysis. Representative samples in triplicate were taken after grinding. An indigenously made sampling glass tube was used to collect samples.<br>
The feed rate conditions were, 25 and 35 kg/h respectively for the proposed and conventional methods employed. The feed rate was varied using screw feeder for the conventional methods. The feed rate for cryogenic grinding was varied through a cryogenic pre-cooler which is of fin type hollow screw, having a diameter of 75 mm and length of 2 m driven by 2 h.p variable speed gear drive that has the provision of circulating around liquid nitrogen on the material. The pressure of liquid nitrogen through Dewar was maintained at 2 kg/cm2 and the period of spraying liquid nitrogen was 5 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.<br>
Sensory analysis on the ground powders was done by the 8 members sensory panel. Essential oil analysis and oleoresin estimation of ground samples were done using Clavenger's method and Cold column extraction by percolation method respectively. Toluene distillation method was used to analyze the moisture contents of ground powders. Gas Chromatographic analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatograph (Model Shimadzu - 15A). Essential oil samples were diluted 5 times with acetone and 1 jal was injected for the analysis. The results of all the analysis are presented in the form of tables (1-4)<br>
EXAMPLE - 2<br>
In this example, data on grinding characteristics of spice mix powder obtained under different feed rates and temperatures by the proposed process along with the quality and quantity of essential oil, particle size are given.<br>
Ten kg batch of mixture of spices constituting spice mix powder were used. The percentage constituents of various spices of a typical spice mix popularly known as "Garam Masala" in India is given in Tablel. The ground powder was packed and sealed immediately after grinding in aluminium foil-polythene laminate pouches and stored in the cold room at 4 degree C for subsequent analysis. Representative samples in triplicate were taken after grinding. An indigenously made sampling glass tube was used to collect samples.<br>
The mixture of spices to be ground was filled into the vibratory feeder where it is metered at a specific rate into the cryogenic pre-cooler. In the cryogenic pre-cooler liquid Nitrogen is injected and combines with the product thereby cooling and embrittling the product. The product is then transported, along with the cold gas generated by the evaporation of liquid Nitrogen, to the grinding mill where it is pulverized and collected in the bin. Excessive cold gas is vented out.<br>
The feed rate conditions were: 15, 30 and 40 kg/h, respectively. The feed rates were varied through a cryogenic pre-cooler which is of fin type hollow screw, having a diameter of 75 mm and length of 2 m driven by 2 h.p variable speed gear drive that has the provision of circulating around liquid nitrogen on<br>
the material. The pressure of liquid nitrogen through Dewar was maintained at 2 kg/cm2 and the period of spraying liquid nitrogen were 3,15 and 20 minutes respectively.<br>
Sensory analysis on the ground powders was done by the 8 members sensory panel. Essential oil analysis and oleoresin estimation of ground samples were done using Clavenger's method and Cold column extraction by percolation method respectively. Toluene distillation method was used to analyze the moisture contents of ground powders. Gas Chromatographic analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatograph (Model Shimadzu - 15A). Essential oil samples were diluted 5 times with acetone and 1 |al was injected for the analysis.

Sensory analysis: Sensory analysis revealed that proposed process samples attained higher ranks for major attributes of spice mix powder such as cumin, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, turmeric, harsh, bitter pungent and astringent as compared to the ones prepared under the with and without water cooled processes. There were no off-notes in all the types of samples. Profilogram of spice mix powder indicated distinct segregation of samples obtained from the proposed process as shown in fig 3.<br>
As it can be seen from the tables 1-4, as well from the sensory analysis that quality of spice mix powder obtained from the proposed process is better than the conventional methods (with and without cooling water) qualitatively and quantitatively. Also based on variance (0.19 - 0.26%) it can be confirmed that the analytical results are reproducible. <br>
