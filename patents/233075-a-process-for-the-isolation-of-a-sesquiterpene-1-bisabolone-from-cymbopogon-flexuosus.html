				<td>(+H-BISABOLONE ISOLATED FROM Cymbopogon flexuosus AND<br>
ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to anti-microbial activity of the essential oil of<br>
Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steud.) Wats and the process of isolation of novel<br>
sesquiterpene- compound mainly responsible for the strong anti-microbial/antibacterial<br>
activity. The present invention particularly relates to anti-bacterial activity of<br>
the essential oil and a pure isolate identified as (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 against<br>
gram positive bacteria from a strain of a grass identified as Cymbopogon flexuosus.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Cymbopgon species (family Poaceae) are native to tropical and subtropical<br>
regions of Asia and Africa. The aromatic grasses such as Cymbopogon and Vetiveria<br>
zizanioides have been known because of their medicinal and perfumery values. The<br>
genus Cymbopogon is well known source of aroma chemicals especially terpenoids.<br>
Essential oil derived from Cymbopogon species such as Java citronella (Cymbopogon<br>
w inter ianus), Palmarosa (Cymbopogon martini var. motia) and Lemongrass<br>
(Cymbopogon flexuosus) are very popular and widely consumed in the world market.<br>
The chemical compounds present in varying concentrations in the species, varieties,<br>
ecotypes and chemotypes of the Cymbopogon grass have a great demand due to their<br>
uses in perfumery, flavour and pharmaceutical industry. There are approximately<br>
sixty species of Cymbopogon native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and<br>
Asia. (Corrigan, D 1992, in "Adverse Effects of Herbal Drugs" Vol. 1, Springer<br>
verlag, Berlin, 115-123). Out of twenty seven species available in India mainly<br>
Cymbopogon flexuosus, C.winterianus and C.martini var. motia have been exploited<br>
for commercial cultivation as a source of citral, citronellal and geraniol respectively.<br>
Development of the new chemocultivars having the higher percentage of<br>
essential oils is generally carried out by the method of phenotypic mass selection. The<br>
oil obtained from the elite strain of Cymbopogon flexuosus, described herein, RLJCF<br>
(HSR) is rich in (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 (30-50%) which owing to strong UV<br>
absorption at 224 nm and refreshing flowery note including potent anti-bacterial<br>
properties may find extensive use in sun-screen lotions, creams and related<br>
preparations as well as in the antiseptic and deodorizing preparations such as creams,<br>
after shave lotions, sprays and powders.<br>
There are a few reports of the occurrence of (-)-l-bisabolone from a natural<br>
source. The first report of its presence (15%) in Stevia purpurea Pers was made by<br>
F.Bohlmann et al. (F.Bohlmann, C.Zedro and S.Schonewiess, Chem. Ber. 109, 1976,<br>
3366-3370). Another publication reporting its presence (12%) in Ethopian<br>
Cymbopogon citratus. (B.Abegaz, P.G.Yohannes and R.K.Dieter, Jour. Nat. Prod. 46,<br>
1983, 424-426). Melkani et al. also reported the enantiomer (-)-l-bisabolone in<br>
concentration ranging from 18-68% in one of the oils of two varieties of Cymbopogon<br>
distans (A.B.Melkani, P.Joshi, A.K.Pant, C.S.Mathela and Vasudev, Jour. Nat. Prod.<br>
48, 1985,995-997).<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to unravel the potent anti-bactrial<br>
activity of main constiutent (+)-l-bisabolone present in the volatile oil of the locally<br>
developed and grown plant Cymbopogon flexuosus, named RLJCF(HSR).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
From a detailed scrutiny of the published literature it is apparent that the<br>
presence of (+)-l-bisabolone from a natural source has not been reported earlier.<br>
Therefore, the presence of (+)-l-bisabolone from Cymbopogon flexuosus being the<br>
first report, is novel and the anti-bacterial activity of the oil bearing the active<br>
compound is also novel.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for the isolation of a sesquiterpene, (+)-l-bisabolone of the formula 1 from Cymbopogon flexuosus<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
said process comprising the steps of: a) hydrodistilling freshly harvested leaves of the grass Cymbopogon flexuosus, b) extracting the distillate with a non-polar solvent to obtain a concentrate, c) hydrodistilling the concentrate and separating the essential oil. followed by separating of the sesquiterpene of formula 1 from the essential oil by fractionation.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the non-polar solvent used for extraction of the distillate is selected from the group consisting of n-hexane, petroleum ether and dichloromethane.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the sesquiterpene of the formula 1 is separated from the essential oil using column chromatography.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the yield of (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 from Cymbopogon flexuosus essential oil is 35-45 %.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1<br>
possesses in vitro anti-microbial activity against gram positive bacteria selected from<br>
Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the sesquiterpene of the formula 1 is<br>
separated from the essential oil using fractionation.<br>
The present invention also relates to an essential oil obtained from the freshly<br>
harvested leaves of Cymbopogon flexuosus and containing a sesquiterpene (+)-!-<br>
* bisabolone as the active ingredient, said essential oil being anti-bacterial activity<br>
against gram positive bacteria.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the yield of (+)-!-bisabolone rich oil<br>
from Cymbopogon flexuosus is 0.3-0.4%.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the essential oil possesses in vitro<br>
anti-microbial activity against gram-positive bacteria selected from Bacillus cereus,<br>
Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The methodology adopted comprises following steps:<br>
a) Chopping of the freshly harvested leaves of the grass Cymbopogon flexuosus<br>
[RLJCF(HSR)].<br>
b) Hydrodistillation of the plant material in a Clevenger type distillation unit or<br>
extraction of the material with non polar solvents such as n-hexane, petroleum<br>
ether, dichloromethane and the like and hydrodistillation of the concentrate<br>
and separation of the essential oil from the aqueous part.<br>
c) Separation of the sesquiterpene of formula 1 from the essential oil by column<br>
chromatography or by fractional distillation.<br>
In vitro anti-bacterial activity of the essential oil and the pure isolate (+)-!-<br>
bisabolone.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention is described the isolation of the<br>
novel sesquiterpene (+)-! -bisabolone of formula 1 displaying potent anti-bacterial<br>
activity against gram positive bacteria. The method comprises,<br>
a) Chopping of the freshly collected leaves of the plant Cymbopogon flexuosus by<br>
known methods.<br>
b) Separation of the volatile oil of the plant in the Clevenger type apparatus by<br>
extraction with a non-polar solvent such as hexane, petroleum ether,<br>
dichloromethane and the like followed by concentration and hydrodistillation or<br>
direct hydrodistillation in an amount of 0.3-0.4% calculated on the basis of wet<br>
plant.<br>
c) Isolation and separation of the compound(+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 in 35-50%<br>
of the total oil by column chromatography or by fractional distillation method.<br>
d) In vitro antibacterial activity of novel sesquiterpene (+)-l-bisabolone of formulal<br>
particularly against gram positive bacteria particularly against Bascillus cereus<br>
and Staphylococcus aureus of bacteria.<br>
The following methodology was employed for the development of the present<br>
strain having novel chemical attributes in its essential oil.<br>
The germplasm of Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees es Steud.) Wats was<br>
collected from wild habitats near Haryana-Rajasthan border and planted in the<br>
experimental farm at Regional Research Laboratory, Jammu for morphological and<br>
chemical characterisation. During the screening programme of the population raised<br>
in our experimental plots one of the plants was found to have very interesting<br>
chemical composition. This genotype was vegetatively propagated, and named<br>
RLJCF (HSR). It has been grown as sizeable plantation at farm of RRL, Jammu.<br>
The essential oil of Cymbopogon flexuosus was obtained by hydrodistillation<br>
method using Clevenger type distillation apparatus. Triplicate distillations were<br>
performed in succession from each sample of 500g of freshly chopped leaves. The oil<br>
obtained was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and subjected to the isolation of<br>
the (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 by column chromatography method and by<br>
fractional distillation. On detailed in vitro studies of the novel sesquiterpene isolate<br>
(+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 it was found to have excellent activity against many<br>
test bacteria. The oil as well as the compound has been found strongly active against<br>
Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and good to moderate<br>
activity against other test bacteria. Experimentally (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 has<br>
shown comparatively far better activity than the standard ampicillin used for gram<br>
positive bacteria.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides anti-bacterial activity against gram<br>
positive bacteria of the novel and main constituent (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1<br>
isolated from the essential oil of Cymbopogon flexuosus, which comprises<br>
a) Chopping of the fresh leaves of the plant by known methods.<br>
b) Separation of the volatile oil of the plant in the Clevenger type apparatus by<br>
known methods.<br>
c) Isolation and separation of the compound (+)-1 -bisabolone of formula 1.<br>
d) In vitro anti-bacterial activity of the novel sesquiterpene (+)-!-bisabolone of<br>
formula 1 against gram positive bacteria.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples:<br>
Examples-1<br>
a) Freshly collected and finely chopped plant material of a chemotype of<br>
Cymbopogon flexuosus (500 g), developed through phenotypic mass selection<br>
technique by our laboratory and grown and domesticated in institutional farm<br>
was subjected to hydro-distillation using Clevenger type apparatus to isolate<br>
the volatile oil. Boiling of the aqueous mixture continued exhaustively for<br>
three hours till approximately 3 ml (0.6%) of pale yellow coloured oil was<br>
collected.<br>
The oil (d, 0.92) has a typical green flowery odour. GLC of the oil on column<br>
showed approximately twenty different peaks, of which one is major (35-<br>
45%). List of some of the volatile components identified by GC/MS analysis<br>
is presented in Table -1.<br>
b) 5 g of the separated oil was subjected to column chromatography over silica<br>
gel (250 g) using hexane ethyl acetate (20:1-5:1). The fractions eluted with<br>
hexane:ethyl acetate (10:1) on removal of the solvent furnished light yellow<br>
liquid (1.9 g) with typical green flowery odour. The compound was identified<br>
as (+)-l-bisbolone of formula 1 by its spectral data which is presented as<br>
under.<br>
The isolated pure product has [cc]D (+)-26°(neat) and (+)-16° (CHC13, 4,c).<br>
'HNMR(CDC13) 6:0.83(3H, d, J=6Hz, CH3), 1.26(4H, bs, CH2), 1.59 &amp; 1.69 (2x3H,<br>
2xs, 2xCH3), 5.16(1H, t, J=6.5Hz, = CH), 5.89(1H, s, =CH). 13CNMR(CDC13): 15.63,<br>
22.45, 24.12, 26.05, 26.23, 30.33, 30.55, 30.97, 34.79, 49.91, 124.59, 126.92, 131.37,<br>
161.12,201.03.<br>
Example-2<br>
Freshly collected and finely chopped plant material of a chemotype of<br>
Cymbopogon flexuosus (500 g), was subjected to Soxhlet extraction with n-hexane (3<br>
It) for 12 hours till the completion of the extraction. The hexane extract was then<br>
concentrated on thin film evaporator under reduced pressure to furnish a thick<br>
greenish yellow colour liquid (42 g). 5g of this liquid was subjected to column<br>
chromatography over silica gel (300g). Elution with hexane:ethyl acetate (20:1-5;1).<br>
The fractions eluted with hexane:ethyl acetate (10;1) on removal of the solvent<br>
furnished light yellow liquid (2.4g) with typical green flowery odour. The compound<br>
was identified as (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1 by its spectral data.<br>
Example-3<br>
Freshly collected and finely chopped plant material of a chemotype of<br>
Cymbopogon flexuosus (1 kg), developed through phenotypic mass selection process<br>
by our laboratory was subjected to hydro-distillation using the Clevenger type<br>
apparatus to isolate the volatile oil. Boiling of the aqueous mixture continued<br>
exhaustively for three hours till approximately 3.9 ml (0.39%) of pale yellow colour<br>
oil was collected. The oil was subjected to fraction distillation under reduced pressure<br>
(5.0-50 mm) through a fractional distillation column at a temperature range of 90°C to<br>
160°C. The initial lower boiling fractions rich in hydrocarbons and monoterpenes<br>
were discarded. The fractions which came last at 150°C-160°C (5-10 mm) were<br>
combined to produce pale yellow fraction containing 85-90% of 1-bisabolone (GLC),<br>
total yield 35% of the oil.<br>
Example - 4: Anti-bacterial activity of (+)-l-bisabolone of formula 1<br>
The pure bacterial cultures of test bacteria were procured from laboratory<br>
culture collection maintained at RRL, Jammu. The bacterial organisms were<br>
subcultured on LB broth. Following filter paper disc agar diffusion method<br>
(Maruzella, J.C. and Henry, P.A. 1958, the antifungal activity of perfume oils. J.<br>
Amer. Pharm. Ass., 47:471-476).<br>
20 ml of sterilized medium was taken in each petriplate. After the agar has<br>
hardened, 2 ml of 24 hrs. broth culture of organism was added to each petriplate and<br>
mixed thoroughly by rotatory motion of the plate and allowed to set. The sterilized<br>
Whatman filter paper No. 1 discs (4 mm diameter) were thoroughly moistened with 5<br>
uJ of (+)- 1-bisabolone of formula 1 in dilution of 1:50, 1:100 in the solvent Tween-80<br>
and placed on the seeded agar plates. The standard antibiotic disc of ampicillin was<br>
placed on surface of each seeded petriplate as standard for anti-bacterial activity.<br>
Three each of seeded agar plates for each organism were incubated at 37°C for 36 hrs.<br>
The relative susceptibility of the organisms to the compound of formula 1 was<br>
demonstrated by a clear zone of inhibition around the disc The zone of inhibition was<br>
measured with the help of a divider. The experiments were performed in triplicate and<br>
average zones of inhibition for anti-bacterial activity are recorded in Table-2.<br>
GC-MS spectra were recorded on QP-2000 Shimadzu model fitted with capillary<br>
column (SE-30, 20mx0.25mm). The sample analysis carried out at a programmed rate<br>
of 4°C/min. from 100-270°C using Helium as a carrier gas at injector temperature of<br>
250°C. The quadrupole mass spectrometer directly coupled to GC column was<br>
operated in El model at 70ev.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
