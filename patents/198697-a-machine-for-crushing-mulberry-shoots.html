				<td>This invention relates to a machine for crushing mulberry shoots for making compost.<br>
Manuring plays a vital role in mulberry cultivation. Mulberry, which is cultivated for leaves for feeding silkworms, utilizes a considerable amount of soil nutrients to put forth foliage. To augment production and quality of leaves, it is very essential to replenish the soil through periodic application of organic manures and fertilizers. Such periodic application of manures and fertilizers adds to the end cost. Further, continuous application of fertilizers degrades the soil. Thus, use of organic manures should be promoted for higher profit in sericulture.<br>
Organic manures supply plant nutrients, improve texture and water<br>
holding capacity of soil and also accelerate microbial activities in it. Studies<br>
have shown that fertilizers are more effective and efficient in the presence of<br>
organic matter in the soil. It is recommended that organic manures for<br>
rainfed and irrigated mulberry should be applied at 10 and 20<br>
tons/hectare/year respectively for good quality of.	<br><br>
leaves and to maintain desired texture and high fertility of soil.<br>
Organic manures are basically of two types i.e. Farm Yarn Manure (FYM) and compost. FYM is prepared by collecting and decomposing dung and waste straw in open pits, whereas compost is prepared from green plant material decomposed in air tight pits.<br>
The availability of farm yarn manure is becoming scarce day by day because of increased use of dung for fuel to cutting of trees and forests. Thus, compost may be good supplement for farm yarn manure. Compost not only provides plant nutrients but also permits recycling of valuable farm waste. Unfortunately, compost making could not gain much popularity due to non-availability of enough green plant material and appropriate devices for its preconditioning.<br>
AS mulberry requires higher amount of organic manure, preparation<br>
and use of compost should be preferred among sericulturists. Mulberry<br>
produces a large quantity of shoots which are quite suitable for making<br>
compost as they contain enough moisture and	,	<br><br>
cellulose. In addition to shoots, a good amount of waste leaves and silkworm litter is also available on a sericultural farm which can also be utilized alongwith shoots for making compost.<br>
Since mulberry shoots are quite hard and fibrous, it takes a long time to decompose them in original form. Hence, direct use of mulberry shoots should be avoided. Chances of attack by white ants are also higher if whole shoots are used. However, decomposition period for mulberry shoots could be reduced significantly by preconditioning them before putting in compost pits. Preconditioning involves cutting and crushing of shoots into small pieces and is essential for the following reasons:<br>
a)	For arresting biological activities in shoots which helps in quick decomposition of plant material.<br>
b)	For developing cracks in shoots to facilitate attack of fungi and bacterial on cellulose.<br>
c)	For reduction in volume of plant material to accommodate large quantity of shoots in a pit.<br>
d)	For easy transportation of plant material to compost pit.<br><br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel construction of a machine for cutting an crushing the shoots of mulberry and other plants.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a machine for crushing mulberry shoots comprising:<br>
e)	a supporting frame;<br>
f)	a rotating drum;<br>
g)	a stationery drum coacting with said rotating drum, said stationary drum and rotating drum are mounted on the said frame;<br>
h) a motive source coupled to said rotating drum for imparting a rotation thereto.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and whereas:<br>
Figure 1 shows schematic diagram of the mulberry shoot crushing machine:<br>
The machine comprises:<br>
a)	Stationary drum 1,<br>
b)	Rotating drum 2,<br>
c)	Frame 3,<br><br>
d)	Drive 4,<br>
e)	Electric motor 5.<br>
Stationary drum 1 is made out of mild steel sheet. Its basic function is to provide support while cutting and crushing of shoots. A feeding chute 6 is also mounted on stationery drum 1. An outlet 12 is provided at the bottom for discharge of crushed material.<br>
Rotating drum 1 is mounted on a steel sheet 13 supported by ball bearing 14. Spikes 7 are provided on drum 1 for cutting and crushing of shoots. M.S angles 8 are provided on drum create suction for pulling shoots inside and also product a blast of air for pushing crushed material out of machine.<br>
Stationary drum 1 and rotating drum 2 are mounted on frame 3. A motor 5 imparts a drive to rotating drum 2. The drive system consists of pulley 9 on shaft of motor pulley 10 on the shaft of rotating drum 2. The energy is transmitted from motor to rotating drum through a V-belt 11.<br>
Shoots are fed to machine via feeding chute 6. They are sucked in and<br>
crushed into pieces. For better	<br><br>
crushing, shoots should be held firmly while seeding. Frequent cleaning of outlet is required as fibers and large pieces of shoots block the outflow of crushed material.<br><br><br><br><br>
