				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of removing carbon dioxide from a fluid stream. In particular, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of removing carbon dioxide from a natural gas stream. The invention further relates to a fluid separation assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural gas from storage or production reservoirs typically contains carbon dioxide (CO2). Such a natural gas is denoted as a "sour" gas. Another species denoted as "sour" in a fluid stream is hydrogen sulphide (H2S). A fluid stream without any of aforementioned sour species is denoted as a "sweet" fluid.<br>
CO2 promotes corrosion within pipelines. Furthermore, in some jurisdictions, legal and commercial requirements with respect to a maximum concentration of CO2 in a fluid stream may be in force. Therefore, it is desirable to remove CO2 from a sour fluid stream.<br>
Fluid sweetening processes, i.e. a process to remove a sour species like carbon dioxide from a fluid stream, are known in the art. Such processes typically include at least one of chemical adsorption, physical adsorption, low temperature distillation, also referred to as cryogenic separation, and membrane separation.<br>
The use of such methods for removing carbon dioxide from a fluid stream is extremely complex and expensive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1 schematically depicts a longitudinal sectional view of a cyclonic fluid separator 1 that may be used in embodiments of the invention. Such a cyclonic fluid separator is described in more detail in international patent application WO03/029739. It must be understood that, in embodiments of the invention, also cyclonic fluid separators of a different type may be used, e.g. a cyclonic fluid separator as described in WO99/01194, WO2006/070019 and WO00/23757.<br>
The cyclonic fluid separator 1 comprises a converging fluid inlet section 3, a diverging fluid outlet section 5 and a tubular throat portion 4 arranged in between the converging fluid inlet section 3 and diverging fluid outlet section 5. The cyclonic fluid separator 1 further comprises a swirl creating device, e.g. a number of swirl imparting vanes 2, configured to create a swirling motion of the fluid within at least part of the cyclonic fluid separator 1.<br>
The converging fluid inlet section 3 comprises a first inlet 10. The diverging fluid outlet section 5 comprises a first outlet 6 and a second outlet 7.<br>
The function of the various components of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 will now be explained with respect to a case in which the cyclonic fluid separator 1 is used to separate<br>
carbon dioxide from a fluid stream comprising carbon dioxide in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The fluid stream comprising carbon dioxide is fed through the first inlet 10 in the converging fluid inlet section 3. In an embodiment of the invention, the fluid stream comprises a mole percentage carbon dioxide larger than 10%. The swirl imparting vanes 2 create a circulation in the fluid stream and are oriented at an angle a relative to the central axis of the cyclonic fluid separator l,.i.e. the axis around which the cyclonic fluid separator 1 is about rotationally symmetric. The swirling fluid stream is then expanded to high velocities. In embodiments of the invention, the number of swirl imparting vanes 2 is positioned in the throat portion 4. In other embodiments, of the invention, the number of swirl imparting vanes 2 is positioned in the converging fluid inlet section 3.<br>
In embodiments of the invention, the swirling fluid stream has a transonic velocity. In other embodiments of the invention, the swirling fluid stream may reach a supersonic velocity. The expansion is performed rapidly. With respect to an expansion two time scales may be defined.<br>
The first time scale is related to a mass transfer time teq, i.e. a time associated with return to equilibrium conditions. The teq depends on the interfacial area density in a two-phase system, the diffusion coefficient between the two phases and the magnitude of the departure from equilibrium. The teq for a liquid-to-solid transition is typically two orders of magnitude larger than for a vapour-to-liquid transition.<br>
The second time scale is related to an expansion residence time tres of the fluid in the device. The tres relates to the average speed of the fluid in the device and the axial length of<br>
the device along which the fluid travels. An expansion is denoted as 'rapid' when teq/tres &gt;1.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Due to the rapid expansion which causes a high velocity of the fluid stream, the swirling fluid stream may reach a temperature below 200 K and a pressure below 50% of a pressure at the first inlet 10 of the converging inlet section 3. As a result of aforementioned expansion, carbon dioxide components are formed in a meta-stable state within the fluid stream. In case the fluid stream at the inlet section 3 is a gas stream, the carbon dioxide components will be formed as liquefied carbon dioxide components. In case the fluid stream at the inlet section 3 is a liquid stream, hydrocarbon vapours will be formed whilst the majority of carbon dioxide components remain in liquid form. In the tubular throat portion 4, the fluid stream may be induced to further expand to higher velocity or be kept at a substantially constant speed.<br>
In the first case, i.e. expansion of the fluid stream to higher velocity, aforementioned formation of carbon dioxide components is ongoing and particles will gain mass. Preferably the expansion is extended to a solid coexistence region (region IVa or IVb in figures 3a, 3b). However solidification will be delayed with respect to equilibrium, since the phase transition from liquid to solid is associated with a barrier of the free energy of formation. As will be further discussed with respect to Figures 3 a, 3b, a portion of the carbon dioxide may solidify.<br>
In case the fluid stream is kept at substantially constant speed, carbon dioxide component formation is about to stop after a defined relaxation time. In both cases, i.e. expansion of the fluid stream to higher velocity and keeping the fluid stream at a substantially constant speed, the centrifugal action causes the carbon dioxide particles to drift to the outer circumference of the flow area adjacent to the inner wall of the housing of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 so as to form an outward fluid stream. In this case the outward fluid stream is a stream of a carbon dioxide enriched fluid, the carbon dioxide components therein being liquefied and/or partly solidified.<br>
Downstream of the tubular throat portion 4, the outward fluid stream comprising the components of carbon dioxide in aforementioned meta-stable state is extracted from the cyclonic fluid separator 1 through the second outlet 7 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1. Other components within the fluid stream not being part of aforementioned outward fluid stream are extracted from the cyclonic fluid separator 1 through first outlet 6 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1.<br>
Figure 2 schematically depicts a cross-sectional view of a separation vessel 21 that may be used in embodiments of the invention. The separation vessel 21 has a first section, further referred to as tubular section 22, with, in use, a substantially vertical orientation positioned on and in connection with a collecting tank 23. The collecting tank 23 is provided with a third outlet 26 and a fourth outlet 28. The tubular section 22 is provided with a second inlet 25 and a fifth outlet 29. The second inlet 25 is connected to the second outlet 7 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1. In an embodiment, the second inlet 25 is arranged to provide a tangential fluid stream into the separation vessel 21, e.g. the second inlet 25 is arranged tangent to the circumference of the separation vessel 21. The separation vessel 21 further comprises a cooling arrangement, in Figure 2 schematically represented by reference number 31, and a separation arrangement, in Figure 2 schematically represented by reference number 33.<br>
The function of the various components of the separation vessel 21 will now be explained with respect to a case in which the separation vessel 21 is used in a method of removing carbon dioxide from a fluid stream in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The cooling arrangement 31 is configured to provide a predetermined temperature condition in the separation vessel 21. The temperature condition is such that it enables<br>
solidification of the carbon dioxide enriched fluid, which enters the separation vessel 21 through the second inlet 25 as a mixture. In other words, the temperature within the separation vessel 21 should remain below the solidification temperature of carbon dioxide, the latter being dependent on the pressure conditions in the separation vessel 21.<br>
Within the separation vessel 21, a mixture comprising carbon dioxide originating from the second outlet 7 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 is split in at least three fractions. These fractions are a first fraction of gaseous components, a second fraction of hydrocarbon, predominantly in a liquid state, and a third fraction of carbon dioxide, predominantly in a solid state.<br>
The first fraction is formed by gaseous components which are dragged along with the liquids exiting the second outlet 7. The cooling arrangement 31 is configured to keep the temperature within the separation vessel 21 below the solidification temperature of the fluid. The gaseous components do not contain much carbon dioxide as most carbon dioxide will be dissolved in the mixture liquid, as will be explained in more detail with reference to Figure 3. The carbon dioxide depleted gaseous components may leave the separation vessel 21 through the fifth outlet 29.<br>
As a result of solidification of carbon dioxide out of the liquid within the mixture, a phenomenon which will be explained in more detail with respect to Figure 3, the mixture, which no longer holds gaseous components, may be split in a liquid component containing hydrocarbon and a solid component of carbon dioxide by means of a separation arrangement 33. Possible separation arrangements 33 include a gravity separator, a centrifuge and a hydro cyclone. In case a gravity separator is used, it preferably comprises a number of stacked plates. In case a centrifuge is used, it preferably comprises a stacked disc bowl. The separation arrangement 33 in the separation vessel 21 is configured to enable hydrocarbon liquid components to leave the separation vessel 21 through the fourth<br>
outlet 28, and to enable solidified carbon dioxide to leave the separation vessel 21 through the third outlet 29.<br>
In an embodiment, the fluid separation assembly further comprises a screw conveyor or scroll type discharger 35 in connection with the third outlet 29. The scroll type discharger 35 is configured to extract the solidified carbon dioxide from the separation vessel 21.<br>
In yet another embodiment, interior surfaces of elements of the fluid separation assembly being exposed to the fluid, i.e. cyclonic fluid separator 1, separation vessel 21 and the one or more tubes or the like connecting the second outlet 7 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 and the second inlet 25 of the separation vessel 21, are provided with a non-adhesive coating. The non-adhesive coating prevents adhesion of solidified fluid components, i.e. carbon dioxide, on aforementioned interior surfaces. Such adhesion would decrease the efficiency of the fluid separation assembly.<br>
Figures 3 a, 3b show an exemplary phase diagram of a natural gas containing carbon dioxide in which schematically different embodiments of the method according to the invention are visualised. The phases are represented as a function of pressure in bar and temperature in degrees Celsius. In this particular case, the natural gas contains 71 mol% CO2. Additionally, the natural gas contains 0.5 mol% nitrogen (N2), 0.5 mol% hydrogen sulphide (H2S), 27 mol% CI, i.e. hydrocarbons with a single carbon atom therein, and 1 mol% C2, i.e. hydrocarbons with two carbon atoms therein. The phases are labelled as follows: V = vapour, L = liquid, C = solid CO2. Areas of different coexisting phases are separated by calculated phase boundaries.<br>
In Figure 3a, the condition of the fluid stream at the first inlet 10 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 schematically depicted in Figure 1 corresponds to the coordinate of 80 bar and<br>
-40 °C , denoted by [START] in the diagram of figure 3a. The isentropic trajectory along arrow A is in the liquid region (II), whereas the isentropic trajectory along arrow B is in the vapour/liquid coexistence region (III). As a result of the expansion in the coexistence region (III), a meta-stable state in the liquid/vapour regime may be reached while following arrow B, until phase transition occurs at a certain super saturated condition. The resulting evaporation process will then restore equilibrium conditions. Further expansion of the fluid stream along the arrow C may result in the fluid to reach a meta-stable state in the vapour/liquid/solid coexistence region (IVb) or in the vapour/solid coexistence region (IVa). Even though along the expansion trajectory denoted with arrow C, a phase transition to form solid carbon dioxide will not occur instantaneously, the carbon dioxide fraction in the vapour will deplete, while more carbon dioxide dissolves in the liquid. In embodiments of the invention, the fluid stream may be separated by a cyclonic fluid separator, e.g. a cyclonic fluid separator as described in International patent application WO2006/070019, in a carbon dioxide enriched fluid stream and a carbon dioxide depleted fluid stream at the end of the expansion trajectory denoted by arrow C. The separated, carbon dioxide enriched fluid is in a state of non-equilibrium, which will only last for a limited period of time, in the order of 10 milliseconds. Therefore the carbon dioxide enriched fluid is recompressed in the second outlet 7 of the diverging outlet section 5 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 and discharged via the second outlet 7 to the separation vessel 21, preferably within said time period that the meta-stable state exists. A breakdown of said meta-stable state results in solid formation which in practice means that dissolved carbon dioxide in the liquid solidifies. As a result of the solidification of carbon dioxide, latent heat is released causing the temperature of the fluid to rise. Therefore the separated, carbon dioxide enriched fluid entering the separation vessel 21, may be cooled in order to ensure that the fluid remains in the vapour/solid or vapour/liquid/solid coexistence region.   Said<br>
process of cooling and recompressing the carbon dioxide enriched fluid is denoted by arrow D. In embodiments of the invention, the process of further solidification takes place in the separation vessel 21. The state of the fluid at a newly developed equilibrium within the separation vessel 21 is denoted as [END]. Solidified carbon dioxide is removed through the third outlet 26 as described above.<br>
In Figure 3b, the condition of the fluid stream at the first inlet 10 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 schematically depicted in Figure 1 corresponds to the coordinate of about 85 bar and about 18 °C , denoted by [START] in the diagram of figure 3b. The isentropic trajectory along arrow A' is in the vapour region (I), whereas the isentropic trajectory along arrow B' is in the vapour/liquid coexistence region (III). As a result of the expansion in the coexistence region (III), a meta-stable state in the liquid/vapour regime may be reached while following arrow B, until phase transition occurs at a certain super-cooled condition. The resulting condensation process will then restore equilibrium conditions. Further expansion of the fluid stream along the arrow C may result in the fluid to reach a meta-stable state in the vapour/liquid/solid coexistence region (IVb) or in the vapour/solid coexistence region (IVa). Even though along the expansion trajectory denoted with arrow C, a phase transition to form solid carbon dioxide will not occur instantaneously. In embodiments of the invention, the fluid stream is separated by the cyclonic fluid separator 1 in a carbon dioxide enriched fluid stream and a carbon dioxide depleted fluid stream at the end of the expansion trajectory denoted by arrow C, a process described above with reference to Figure 1. Additionally, further details with respect to such a process may be found in international application WO03/029739. The separated, carbon dioxide enriched fluid is in a state of non-equilibrium, which will only last for a limited period of time, in the order of 10 milliseconds. Therefore the carbon dioxide enriched fluid is recompressed in the diverging outlet section 5 of the cyclonic fluid separator 1 and discharged via the<br>
second outlet 7 to the separation vessel 21, preferably within said time period that the meta-stable state exists. A breakdown of said meta-stable state results in solid carbon dioxide formation from the liquefied part of the fluid stream. As a result of the solidification of carbon dioxide, latent heat is released causing the temperature of the fluid to rise. Therefore the separated, carbon dioxide enriched fluid entering the separation vessel 21, may be cooled in order to ensure that the fluid remains in the vapour/solid or vapour/liquid/solid coexistence region. Said process of cooling and recompressing the carbon dioxide enriched fluid is denoted by arrow D'.<br>
In embodiments of the invention, the process of solidification takes place in the separation vessel 21. The state of the fluid at a newly developed equilibrium within the separation vessel 21 is denoted as [END]. Again, solidified carbon dioxide is removed through the third outlet 26 as described above.<br>

The description above is intended to be illustrative, not limiting.
