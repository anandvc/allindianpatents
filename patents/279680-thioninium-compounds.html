				<td>RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is related to United States patent application number 60/786,699 filed<br>
29 March 2006; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention pertains generally to processes, uses, methods and materials utilising<br>
particular diaminophenothiazinium compounds. These compounds are useful as drugs, for<br>
example, in the treatment of tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A number of patents and publications are cited herein in order to more fully describe and<br>
disclose the invention and the state of the art to which the invention pertains. Each of these<br>
references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure, to<br>
the same extent as if each individual reference was specifically and individually indicated to<br>
be incorporated by reference.<br>
Throughout this specification, including the claims which follow, unless the context requires<br>
otherwise, the word "comprise," and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising," will be<br>
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but<br>
not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular<br>
forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates<br>
otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a pharmaceutical carrier" includes mixtures of<br>
two or more such carriers, and the like.<br>
Ranges are often expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to "about"<br>
another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes<br>
from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are<br>
expressed as approximations, by the use of the antecedent "about," it will be understood that<br>
the particular value forms another embodiment.<br>
Conditions of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are frequently characterised by a<br>
progressive accumulation of intracellular and/or extracellular deposits of proteinaceous<br>
structures such as β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brains of<br>
affected patients. The appearance of these lesions largely correlates with pathological<br>
neurofibrillary degeneration and brain atrophy, as well as with cognitive impairment<br>
 <br>
(see, e.g., Mukaetova-Ladinska, E.B., et al., 2000, Am. J. Pathol., Vol. 157, No. 2,<br>
pp. 623-636).<br>
In AD, both neuritic plaques and NFTs contain paired helical filaments (PHFs), of which a<br>
major constituent is the microtubule-associated protein tau (see, e.g., Wischik et a!., 1988,<br>
PNAS USA, Vol. 85, pp. 4506-4510). Plaques also contain extracellular β-amyioid fibrils<br>
derived from the abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (see, e.g., Kang et<br>
al., 1987, Nature, Vol. 325, p. 733). An article by Wischik et al. (in 'Neurobiology of<br>
Alzheimer's Disease', 2nd Edition, 2000, Eds. Dawbarn, D. and Allen, S.J., The Molecular<br>
and Cellular Neurobiology Series, Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford) discusses in detail the<br>
putative rote of tau protein in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementias. Loss of the<br>
normal form of tau, accumulation of pathological PHFs, and loss of synapses in the mid-<br>
frontal cortex ail correlate with associated cognitive impairment. Furthermore, loss of<br>
synapses and loss of pyramidal cells both correlate with morphometric measures of tau-<br>
reactive neurofibrillary pathology, which parallels, at a molecular level, an almost total<br>
redistribution of the tau protein pool from a soluble to a polymerised form (i.e., PHFs) in<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Tau exists in alternatively-spliced isoforms, which contain three or four copies of a repeat<br>
sequence corresponding to the microtubule-binding domain (see, e.g., Goedert, M., et al.,<br>
1989, EMBO J., Vol. 8, pp. 393-399; Goedert, M., et al., 1989, Neuron, Vol. 3, pp. 519-526).<br>
Tau in PHFs is proteolytically processed to a core domain (see, e.g., Wischik, CM., et al.,<br>
1988, PNAS USA, Vol. 85, pp. 4884-4888; Wischik etal., 1988, PNAS USA, Vol. 85, pp.<br>
4506-4510; Novak, M., et al., 1993, EMBO J., Vol. 12, pp. 365-370) which is composed of a<br>
phase-shifted version of the repeat domain; only three repeats are involved in the stable tau-<br>
tau interaction (see, e.g., Jakes, R., etal., 1991, EMBO J., Vol. 10, pp. 2725-2729). Once<br>
formed, PHF-like tau aggregates act as seeds for the further capture and provide a template<br>
for proteolytic processing of full-length tau protein (see, e.g., Wischik et al., 1996, PNAS<br>
USA, Vol. 93, pp. 11213-11218).<br>
The phase shift which is observed in the repeat domain of tau incorporated into PHFs<br>
suggests that the repeat domain undergoes an induced conformational change during<br>
incorporation into the filament. During the onset of AD, it is envisaged that this<br>
conformational change could be initiated by the binding of tau to a pathological substrate,<br>
such as damaged or mutated membrane proteins (see, e.g., Wischik, CM., et al., 1997, in<br>
"Microtubule-associated proteins: modifications in disease", Eds. Avila, J., Brandt, R. and<br>
Kosik, K. S. (Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam) pp. 185-241).<br>
In the course of their formation and accumulation, PHFs first assemble to form amorphous<br>
aggregates within the cytoplasm, probably from early tau oligomers which become truncated<br>
prior to, or in the course of, PHF assembly (see, e.g., Mena, R., et al., 1995, Acta<br>
 <br>
Neuropathol., Vol. 89, pp. 50-56; Mena, R., et al., 1996, Acta Neuropathol., Vol. 91, pp. 633-<br>
641). These filaments then go on to form classical intracellular NFTs. In this state, the<br>
PHFs consist of a core of truncated tau and a fuzzy outer coat containing full-length tau (see,<br>
e.g., Wischik et al., 1996, PNAS USA, Vol. 93, pp. 11213-11218). The assembly process is<br>
exponential, consuming the cellular pool of normal functional tau and inducing new tau<br>
synthesis to make up the deficit (see, e.g., Lai, R. Y. K., et al., 1995, Neurobiology of Ageing,<br>
Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 433-445). Eventually, functional impairment of the neurone progresses to<br>
the point of cell death, leaving behind an extracellular NFT. Cell death is highly correlated<br>
with the number of extracellular NFTs (see, e.g., Wischik et al., in 'Neurobiology of<br>
Alzheimer's Disease', 2nd Edition, 2000, Eds. Dawbarn, D. and Allen, S.J., The Molecular<br>
and Cellular Neurobiology Series, Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford). As tangles are<br>
extruded into the extracellular space, there is progressive loss of the fuzzy outer coat of the<br>
neurone with corresponding loss of N-terminal tau immunoreactivity, but preservation of tau<br>
immunoreactivity associated with the PHF core (see, e.g., Bondareff, W. et al., 1994, J.<br>
Neuropath. Exper. Neurol., Vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 158-164).<br>
Diaminophenothiazines have previously been shown to inhibit tau protein aggregation and to<br>
disrupt the structure of PHFs, and reverse the proteolytic stability of the PHF core (see, e.g.,<br>
WO 96/30766, F Hoffman-La Roche). Such compounds were disclosed for use in the<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. These<br>
included, amongst others:<br>
 <br>
Additionally, WO 02/055720 (The University Court of the University of Aberdeen) discusses<br>
the use of reduced forms of diaminophenothiazines specifically for the treatment of a variety<br>
of protein aggregating diseases, although the disclosure is primarily concerned with<br>
tauopathies.<br>
 <br>
WO 2005/030676 (The University Court of the University of Aberdeen) discusses<br>
radiolabelled phenothiazines, and their use in diagnosis and therapy, for example, of<br>
tauopathies.<br>
Notwithstanding these disclosures, it will be appreciated that the provision of one or more<br>
further compounds, not previously specifically identified as being effective tau protein<br>
aggregation inhibitors, would provide a contribution to the art.<br>
PCT/GB2005/003634 (TauRx Therapeutics Pte. Ltd) was filed, but not published, prior to the<br>
filing of the present application (WO 2006/032879 A2 was published on 30 March 2006).<br>
That application relates inter alia to methods of synthesizing and purifying certain<br>
3,7-diamino-phenothiazin-5-ium compounds (referred to as "diaminophenothiazinium<br>
compounds') including MTC and other compounds described herein. It further discloses<br>
therapeutic uses of these compounds.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have now identified certain thioninium compounds as being effective<br>
tau protein aggregation inhibitors and in preferred forms having certain other desirable<br>
properties, for example by comparison with the compounds of the prior art discussed above.<br>
As discussed above, tau proteins are characterised as being one among a larger number of<br>
protein families which co-purify with microtubules during repeated cycles of assembly and<br>
disassembly (Shelanski et al. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 70., 765-768), and are<br>
known as microtubule-associated-proteins (MAPs). Members of the tau family share the<br>
common features of having a characteristic N-terminal segment, sequences of<br>
approximately 50 amino acids inserted in the N-terminal segment, which are<br>
developmentally regulated in the brain, a characteristic tandem repeat region consisting of 3<br>
or 4 tandem repeats of 31-32 amino acids, and a C-terminal tail.<br>
One or more of these specific compounds are known in the art - for example MTZ is<br>
described in Fierz-David and Blangley, 1949, "F. Oxazine and Thiazine Dyes," in:<br>
Fundamental Processes of Dye Chemistry, published by Interscience (London, UK),<br>
pp. 308-314. However it is believed that none of these have previously been disclosed in<br>
the prior art as tau protein aggregation inhibitors.<br>
The invention therefore relates to methods, uses, compositions and other materials<br>
employing these compounds as tau protein aggregation inhibitors and as therapeutics or<br>
prophylactics of diseases associated with tau protein aggregation ("tauopathies"). The<br>
invention further provides processes for making these compounds.<br>
 <br>
These and other aspects of the invention are discussed in more detail hereinafter.<br>

chelated with, or otherwise be associated with, other chemical groups, such as stable and<br>
unstable detectable isotopes, radioisotopes, positron-emitting atoms, magnetic resonance<br>
labels, dyes, fluorescent markers, antigenic groups, therapeutic moieties, or any other<br>
moiety that may aid in a prognostic, diagnostic or therapeutic application.<br>
For example, as noted above, in one embodiment, the diaminophenothiazinium compound is<br>
as defined above, but with the additional limitation that the compound incorporates, is<br>
conjugated to, is chelated with, or is otherwise associated with one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3,4,<br>
etc.) isotopes, radioisotopes, positron-emitting atoms, magnetic resonance labels, dyes,<br>
fluorescent markers, antigenic groups, or therapeutic moieties.<br>
In one embodiment, the diaminophenothiazinium compound is a ligand as well as a label,<br>
e.g., a label for tau protein (or aggregated tau protein), and incorporates, is conjugated to, is<br>
chelated with, or is otherwise associated with, one or more (e.g., 1,2,3,4, etc.) detectable<br>
labels.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the diaminophenothiazinium compound is as defined<br>
above, but with the additional limitation that the compound incorporates, is conjugated to, is<br>
chelated with, or is otherwise associated with, one or more (e.g., 1,2,3, 4, etc.) detectable<br>
labels.<br>
Labelled diaminophenothiazinium compounds (e.g., when ligated to tau protein or<br>
aggregated tau protein) may be visualised or detected by any suitable means, and the<br>
skilled person will appreciate that any suitable detection means as is known in the art may<br>
be used.<br>
For example, the diaminophenothiazinium compound (ligand-label) may be suitably detected<br>
by incorporating a positron-emitting atom (e.g., 11C) (e.g., as a carbon atom of one or more<br>
alkyl group substituents, e.g., methyl group substituents) and detecting the compound using<br>
positron emission tomography (PET) as is known in the art.<br>
Suitable methods for preparing these and similar 11C labelled diaminophenothiaziniums are<br>
shown, for example, in WO 02/075318 (see Figures 11a, 11b, 12) and WO 2005/030676.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of labelling tau protein (or<br>
aggregated tau protein) comprising the step of: contacting the tau protein (or aggregated tau<br>
protein) with a diaminophenothiazinium compound that incorporates, is conjugated to, is<br>
chelated with, or is otherwise associated with, one or more (e.g., 1,2,3, 4, etc.) detectable<br>
labels.<br>
 <br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of detecting tau protein (or<br>
aggregated tau protein) comprising the steps of: contacting the tau protein (or aggregated<br>
tau protein) with a diaminophenothiazinium compound that incorporates, is conjugated to, is<br>
chelated with, or is otherwise associated with, one or more (e.g., 1,2,3,4, etc.) detectable<br>
labels, and detecting the presence and\or amount of said compound bound to tau protein (or<br>
aggregated tau protein).<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of diagnosis or prognosis of a<br>
tau proteinopathy in a subject believed to suffer from the disease, comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) introducing into the subject a diaminophenothiazinium compound capable of labelling tau<br>
protein or aggregated tau protein, particularly tau protein (e.g., a diaminophenothiazinium<br>
compound that incorporates, is conjugated to, is chelated with, or is otherwise associated<br>
with, one or more (e.g., 1,2,3, 4, etc.) detectable labels),<br>
(ii) determining the presence and\or amount of said compound bound to tau protein or<br>
aggregated tau protein in the brain of the subject,<br>
(iii) correlating the result of the determination made in (ii) with the disease state of the<br>
subject.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a diaminophenothiazinium compound<br>
capable of labelling tau protein or aggregated tau protein (e.g., a diaminophenothiazinium<br>
compound that incorporates, is conjugated to, is chelated with, or is otherwise associated<br>
with, one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) detectable labels), for use in a method of diagnosis or<br>
prognosis of a tau proteinopathy.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides use of a diaminophenothiazinium<br>
compound capable of labelling tau protein or aggregated tau protein, particularly tau protein<br>
(e.g., a diaminophenothiazinium compound that incorporates, is conjugated to, is chelated<br>
with, or is otherwise associated with, one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3,4, etc.) detectable labels), in<br>
a method of manufacture of a diagnostic or prognostic reagent for use in the diagnosis or<br>
prognosis of a tau proteinopathy.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that instead of administering diaminophenothiazinium<br>
ligands/abels directly, they could be administered in a precursor form, for conversion to the<br>
active form (e.g., ligating form, labelling form) by an activating agent present in, or<br>
administered to, the same subject.<br>
The ligands disclosed herein may be used as part of a method of diagnosis or prognosis. It<br>
may be used to select a patient for treatment, or to assess the effectiveness of a treatment<br>
or a therapeutic (e.g. an inhibitor of tau protein aggregation) administered to the subject.<br>
 <br>
Methods of Synthesis<br>
Methods for the chemical synthesis of compounds of the present invention are described in<br>
the Examples herein. These and/or other well known methods may be modified and/or<br>
adapted in known ways in order to facilitate the synthesis of other compounds of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Thus one aspect of the invention provides a method of synthesising a compound of the<br>
invention as described herein, described, or substantially as described, with reference to any<br>
of the Examples hereinafter.<br>
The invention further provides a diaminophenothiazinium compound of the invention which is<br>

Some aspects of the invention will now be explained in more detail:<br>
Treatment<br>
The term "treatment," as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally<br>
to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g., in veterinary applications),<br>
in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the<br>
progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate<br>
of progress, regression of the condition, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the<br>
condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e., prophylaxis, prevention) is also<br>
included.<br>
The term "therapeutically-effective amount," as used herein, pertains to that amount of an<br>
active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active<br>
compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate<br>
with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired<br>
treatment regimen.<br>
Similarly, the term "prophylactically-effective amount," as used herein, pertains to that<br>
amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an<br>
active compound, which is effective for producing some desired prophylactic effect,<br>
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a<br>
desired treatment regimen.<br>
The term "treatment" includes combination treatments and therapies, in which two or more<br>
treatments or therapies are combined, for example, sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the<br>
 <br>
administration of active agents, including, e.g., drugs, antibodies (e.g., as in<br>
immunotherapy), prodrugs (e.g., as in photodynamic therapy, GDEPT, ADEPT, etc.);<br>
surgery; radiation therapy; and gene therapy.<br>
Routes of Administration<br>
The diaminophenothiazinium compound, or pharmaceutical composition comprising it, may<br>
be administered to a subject/patient by any convenient route of administration, whether<br>
systemically/peripherally or topically (i.e., at the site of desired action).<br>
Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral (e.g., by ingestion); buccal;<br>
sublingual; transdermal (including, e.g., by a patch, plaster, etc.); transmucosal (including,<br>
e.g., by a patch, piaster, etc.); intranasal (e.g., by nasal spray); ocular (e.g., by eyedrops);<br>

a human.<br>
Furthermore, the subject/patient may be any of its forms of development, for example, a<br>
foetus.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the subject/patient is a human.<br>
Suitable subjects for the method may be selected on the basis of conventional factors. Thus<br>
the initial selection of a patient may involve any one or more of: rigorous evaluation by<br>
experienced clinician; exclusion of non-AD diagnosis as far as possible by supplementary<br>
laboratory and other investigations; objective evaluation of level of cognitive function using<br>
neuropathotogically validated battery.<br>
 <br>
In one embodiment, the subject/patient is not a human.<br>
Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the diaminophenothiazinium compound to be used (e.g.,<br>
administered) alone, it is often preferable to present it as a composition or formulation.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation,<br>
preparation, medicament) comprising a diaminophenothiazinium compound, as described<br>
herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least<br>
one diaminophenothiazinium compound, as described herein, together with one or more<br>
other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art,<br>
including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients,<br>
adjuvants, fillers, buffers, preservatives, anti-oxidants, lubricants, stabilisers, solubilisers,<br>
surfactants (e.g., wetting agents), masking agents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, and<br>
sweetening agents.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition further comprises other active agents, for example,<br>
other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.<br>
Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts.<br>
See, for example, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives. 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I.<br>
Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, New York, USA), Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences. 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000; and<br>
Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. 2nd edition, 1994.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising admixing at least one [11C]-radiolabelled phenothiazine or<br>
phenothiazine-like compound, as defined herein, together with one or more other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., carriers,<br>
diluents, excipients, etc. If formulated as discrete units (e.g., tablets, etc.), each unit<br>
contains a predetermined amount (dosage) of the active compound.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable," as used herein, pertains to compounds,<br>
ingredients, materials, compositions, dosage forms, etc., which are, within the scope of<br>
sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in<br>
question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other<br>
problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier,<br>
 <br>
diluent, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the<br>
other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such<br>
methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier<br>
which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are<br>
prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with<br>
carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the product, if<br>
necessary.<br>
The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate, delayed,<br>
timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which<br>
the active ingredient is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or<br>
other microparticulate). Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers,<br>
bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the<br>
formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient.<br>
Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable<br>
oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the<br>
concentration of the active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 µg/ml,<br>
for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 pg/ml. The formulations may be presented in<br>
unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be<br>
stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid<br>
carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection<br>
solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.<br>
Examples of Formulations<br>
One aspect of the present invention pertains to a dosage unit (e.g., a pharmaceutical tablet<br>
or capsule) comprising 20 to 300 mg of a diaminophenothiazinium compound as described<br>
herein (e.g., obtained by, or obtainable by, a method as described herein; having a purity as<br>
described herein; etc.), and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.<br>
In one embodiment, the dosage unit is a tablet.<br>
In one embodiment, the dosage unit is a capsule.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is 30 to 200 mg.<br>
 <br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 30 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 60 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 100 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 150 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 200 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient is or<br>
comprises one or both of a glyceride (e.g., Gelucire 44/14 ®; lauroyl macrogol-32 glycerides<br>
PhEur, USP) and colloidal silicon dioxide (e.g., 2% Aerosil 200 ®; Colliodal Silicon Dioxide<br>
PhEur, USP).<br>
Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the<br>
diaminophenothiazinium compound, and compositions comprising the<br>
diaminophenothiazinium compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the<br>
optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against<br>
any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of<br>
factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of<br>
administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration<br>
of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, the severity<br>
of the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition, general health, and prior<br>
medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will<br>
ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally<br>
the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which<br>
achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided<br>
doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining<br>
the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the<br>
art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target<br>
cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be<br>
carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician,<br>
veterinarian, or clinician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about<br>
25 mg (more typically about 1 ug to about 10 mg) per kilogram body weight of the subject<br>
per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the<br>
amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual<br>
weight to be used is increased proportionately.<br>
 <br>
In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to<br>
the following dosage regime: about 100 mg, 3 times daily.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to<br>
the following dosage regime: about 150 mg, 2 times daily.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to<br>
the following dosage regime: about 200 mg, 2 times daily.<br>
The invention will now be further described with reference to the following non-limiting<br>
Examples. Other embodiments of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art in the<br>
light of these.<br>
The disclosure of all references cited herein, inasmuch as it may be used by those skilled in<br>
the art to carry out the invention, is hereby specifically incorporated herein by cross-<br>
reference.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Methods of Synthesis<br>
The following syntheses are provided solely for illustrative purposes and are not intended to<br>
limit the scope of the invention, as described herein.<br>
 <br>
N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (5 g, 30.4 mmol) was dissolved in diethyl ether (25 cm3)<br>
and hydrochloric acid (6 cm3,10 M) was added and the mixture was concentrated to give the<br>
title compound (7.22 g, 100%) as a red/brown solid. δH (250 MHz; D20): 7.68 (4H, m, ArH),<br>
3.69 (4H, q, 7.32, NCH2), 1.11 (6H, t, 7.32, CH3); δc (62.9 MHz; D20): 12.1 (CH3), 56.4<br>
(NCH2), 126.8 (ArC), 127.6 (ArC), 135.5 (ArC), 139.1 (ArC).<br>
Ethyl-thioninium chloride<br>
/V,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (7.22 g, 30.4 mmol) was dissolved in water<br>
(250 cm3) and the pH adjusted to 1.6 with HCI, to which sodium sulphide (&gt;60%) (3.95 g,<br>
30.4 mmol) was added portionwise. The suspension was stirred until all the sodium sulphide<br>
had dissolved. A solution of iron (III) chloride (27.15 g, 100 mmol) in water (200 cm3) was<br>
prepared and half the solution was added to the mixture. An immediate colour change from<br>
light yellow to blue occurred. The solution was then aerated for 1 hour before the remaining<br>
iron (III) chloride solution was added. The mixture was cooled to 5°C and filtered to remove<br>
a light green sludge. Aqueous HCI (15 cm3, 6 M) was added to the filtrate, followed by<br>
sodium chloride (60 g), and the suspension stirred for 5 minutes before filtering to give a<br>
solid product, which was dissolved in DCM, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered, and<br>
concentrated to give a purple/green solid (1.28 g, 22%). This purple/green solid was loaded<br>
onto a prepared C18 reverse phase column and washed with water (1 L) or until the yellow<br>
colour ceased. The product was washed off the column with MeOH/HCI (pH 2) and<br>
 <br>
concentrated to give the title compound (0.64 g, 11 %) as a sticky purple solid. δH (250 MHz;<br>
D20): 1.26(12H, t, 6.5, CH3), 3.56 (8H, q, 6.5, NCH2), 7.01 (2H, s, ArH), 7.20 (2H, d, 9.25,<br>
ArH), 7.54 (2H, d, 9.25, ArH); m/z (ESI) 340.2 (100%, [M-CI]+).<br>
 <br>
To a 250cm3 round bottom flask was added water (100 cm3) and the temperature was<br>
reduced to 5°C with an ice bath. To this cooled solution was carefully added sulphuric acid<br>
(98%, 22.5 g). To this solution was added 3-methyl-N,/V-dimethylaniline (10 g, 74 mmol) and<br>
then sodium nitrite (5.6 g, 81.4 mmol), and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1<br>
hour. Iron (Fe) filings (12.8 g, 229 mmol) were added and the mixture stirred for a further 2<br>
hours. The solution was filtered and then neutralized with saturated sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate solution and the organics were extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 100 cm3). The<br>
extracts were dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered, and concentrated to give a brown oil.<br>
The oil was dissolved in diethyl ether (100 cm3) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (50 cm3)<br>
was added. The solution was evaporated to dryness to give the title compound (10 g, 60%)<br>
as a light tan solid. vmax (KBr)/cm1: 2849 (CH), 2821 (CH), 2543 (CH), 2444 (CH), 1586<br>

Dimethylmethythioninium Chloride<br>
To a 500 cm3 round bottom flask was added 3-methyl-/V,/V-dimethyl-phenylene-diamine<br>
dihydrochloride (0.9 g, 4.03 mmol) which was dissolved in aqueous hydrochloric acid<br>
(50 cm3, 3 M) before sodium sulphide (&gt;60%) (0.52 g, 4.03 mmol) was added. Iron (III)<br>
 <br>
chloride hexahydrate (7.26 g, 27 mmol) was dissolved in water (50 cm3) and half of this<br>
solution was poured into the reaction mixture, giving an immediate blue colour. The solution<br>
was then aerated for 2 hours before the remaining aqueous iron (III) chloride solution was<br>
added. The mixture was cooled to 5°C and filtered; the precipitate was dissolved in boiling<br>
water (60 cm3), filtered, and cooled. Hydrochloric acid (10 cm3, 6 M) was added to the<br>
cooled solution, which was then filtered to yield the title compound (0.22 g, 16%) as a<br>

To a 100 cm3 round bottom flask was added 3-ethylaniline (10 g, 82.5 mmol), ethanol<br>
(15 cm3), sodium carbonate (11.81 g, 111.4 mmol). Methyl iodide (31.63 g, 222 mmol) was<br>
added dropwise. The mixture was then heated at 45°C for 10 hours before cooling to room<br>
temperature and adding water (100 cm3). The mixture was extracted into diethyl ether (3 x<br>
100 cm3) and the extracts were dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered, and concentrated to<br>
give the title compound (4.68 g, 38%) as a light yellow oil. v,max(neat)/cm1:3045 (CH), 2960<br>

This synthesis represents an alternative to Synthesis 3 above. The principal advantages of<br>
this synthesis compared to Synthesis 3 above are: (a) higher yield, (b) it can be performed at<br>
greater concentrations making it more suitable for use on an industrial scale, and (c) it does<br>
not produce H2S, and so is cheaper and simpler when performed on an industrial scale.<br>

the other of the following two alternatives.<br>
In one alternative (Filtration of BG (two-pot)): The dark green solid which formed was filtered<br>
off, washed with water (2 x 50 mL) and sucked to reasonable dryness (30 minutes). The<br>
dark green solid was stirred in water acidified to pH 2 with hydrochloric acid and<br>
CuS04.5H20 (0.99 g, 4.00 mmol) was added. The solution was heated to 90°C and stirred<br>
for 1 hour at this temperature resulting in the formation of an intense blue solution. Heating<br>
 <br>
was stopped and the reaction mixture was left to cool to room temperature. The blue<br>
solution was filtered to remove insolubles and the solid washed with water (2 x 50 mL). The<br>
filtrate was acidified to pH 2 with hydrochloric acid (5 M, 5 mL) and NaN03 (33 g, 388 mmol)<br>
was added in one portion. The solution was heated to 80°C and left to cool to room<br>
temperature with gentle stirring. The green needles which resulted were filtered from the<br>
solution and sucked to dryness to give the title compound (4.38g, 28%). Mp 178°C; vmax<br>

135.6,118.1, 106.4,46.6, 12.9.<br>
In another alternative (No-filtration of BG (one-pot)): Once the solution had warmed,<br>
CuS04.5H20 (0.99 g, 4.00 mmol) was added. The solution was then heated to 90°C and<br>
stirred at this temperature for 1 hour, after which the solution had turned deep blue. The<br>
blue solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered to remove insolubles.<br>
The filtrate was adjusted to pH 2 with hydrochloric acid (5 M, 20 mL approx.) and NaN03<br>
(33 g, 388 mmol) was added. The stirring solution was heated to 80°C and left to cool<br>
overnight with gentle stirring. The resulting green needles were filtered from solution and<br>
sucked to dryness to give the title compound (1g, 5%). Mp 178°C; vmax(KBr)/cm"1 3564<br>
(CH), 3463 (CH), 3048 (CH), 2975 (CH), 1522 (C=C), 1489 (CH), 1370 (CH); δH (250 MHz,<br>

Example 2 - Activity and Therapeutic Index<br>
In vitro assay for establishing B50<br>
This is described in detail in WO 96/30766. Briefly, a fragment of tau corresponding to the<br>
core repeat domain, which has been adsorbed to a solid phase substrate, is able to capture<br>
soluble full-length tau and bind tau with high affinity. This association confers stability<br>
against proteolytic digestion of the aggregated tau molecules. The process is self-<br>
propagating, and can be blocked selectively by prototype pharmaceutical agents.<br>
More specifically, truncated tau (residues 297-390; dGA) diluted in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6)<br>
was bound to the assay plate, and full-length tau (T40) was added in the aqueous phase.<br>
The aqueous phase binding buffer contained 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% gelatine in<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (pH7.4). Bound tau was detected using mAb 499 that recognises<br>
an N-terminal epitope within the aqueous phase full-length tau but that fails to recognise the<br>
solid phase-bound truncated tau fragment.<br>
 <br>
The concentration of compound required to inhibit the tau-tau binding by 50% is referred to<br>
as the B50 value.<br>
Cell-based assay for establishing EC50<br>
The process is described in more detail in WO 02/055720. In essence, fibroblast cells (3T6)<br>
express full-length tau ("T40") under control of an inducible promoter, and low constitutive<br>
levels of the PHF-core tau fragment (12 kD fragment). When T40 expression is induced, it<br>
undergoes aggregation-dependent truncation within the cell, N-terminally at ~ αα 295 and C-<br>
terminally at ~ αα 390, thereby producing higher levels of the 12 kD PHF-core domain<br>
fragment. Production of the 12 kD fragment can be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by<br>
tau-aggregation inhibitors. Indeed the quantitation of inhibitory activity of compounds with<br>
respect to proteolytic generation of the 12 kD fragment within cells can be described entirely<br>
in terms of the same parameters which describe inhibition of tau-tau binding in vitro. That is,<br>
the extent of proteolytic generation of the 12 kD fragment within cells is determined entirely<br>
by the extent to tau-tau binding through the repeat domain. The availability of the relevant<br>
proteases within the cell is non-limiting.<br>
Results are expressed as the concentration at which there is a 50% inhibition of generation<br>
of the 12 kD fragment. This is referred to as the EC50 value.<br>
Toxicity in cells - LD50 and therapeutic index (Rxl)<br>
Toxicity of the compounds described herein was assessed in the cell based assay used to<br>
assess EC50. Toxicity was measured by cell numbers after 24 hrs exposure to the<br>
compound using a lactate dehydrogenase assay kit TOX-7(Sigma Biosciences) according to<br>
the manufacturer's instructions after lysis of remaining cells. Alternatively a kit from Promega<br>
UK (CytoTox 96) was used, again according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
