				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001] This invention relates to documents of value, such as bank notes, checks,<br>
passports, ID cards or the like with increased fitness for circulation, to a security paper<br>
for producing them, and to a method for producing said security paper and such docu-<br>
ments of value.<br>
[0002] Bank notes are usually made of so-called security papers consisting of cotton<br>
fibers and having special security features, such as intaglio printed motifs, hologram<br>
patches and watermarks. A bank note's period of circulation depends on the stress.<br>
Certain denominations are preferably used in trade and thus have a smaller period of<br>
circulation due to the stronger load through environmental influences. Environmental<br>
influences are for example attack by different chemical substances, such as perspira-<br>
tion, fat, oil, lyes, acids, etc. Particularly smaller note values are subject to increased<br>
wear. The main cause of the restricted period of circulation for bank notes is consid-<br>
ered to be (besides premature soiling) initial tear of the bank note in the edge area.<br>
[0003] US 3 661 700 describes a coated, reinforced paper produced by coating a<br>
support comprising a net of a longitudinally oriented polypropylene film with a mix-<br>
ture of cellulose-containing fibers and/or other fibers and mineral and/or organic pig-<br>
ments or fillers, and binders. Since me net is used for reinforcement, it must have the<br>
same dimensions as the paper to be reinforced therewith.<br>
[0004] British patent no. 3453 describes a paper for bank notes, papers of value and<br>
the like containing a fine, open-mesh fabric with or without figures, patterns or num-<br>
bers. The open-mesh fabric is incorporated into the paper by being passed into the p-<br>
per stock while the stock is being moved over a screen on its way from the tank to the<br>
press rolls, before it reaches the press rolls so that the fabric can be pressed into the<br>
flowable paper stock. In this case, too, the fabric has the same dimensions as the paper.<br>
[0005] British print 1 219 643 relates to the production of reinforced paper whereby<br>
a netlike or meshed reinforcement material is incorporated by different methods. The<br>
reinforcement material has the same dimensions as the paper.<br><br>
[0006] AU-PS 488,652, for example, has proposed making bank notes completely<br>
from a plastic substrate. Said plastic substrates do have higher initial tear resistance<br>
than paper substrates but the plastic substrate's tear propagation resistance is extremely<br>
low in comparison with a paper substrate. Further, with a plastic bank note there can<br>
be no use of customary and proved security elements such as portrait watermark and<br>
windowed security thread. Also, the steel gravure printing customary in the bank note<br>
field, which serves as an additional tactile authenticity mark due to the relief arising<br>
from the inking, leads only to a flat, hardly perceptible relief on plastic substrates.<br>
[0007] The above-described prior art security papers moreover share the disadvan-<br>
tage that the incorporation of an all-over net or the use of a plastic substrate causes the<br>
special properties, such as sound and feel, of bank note paper to be completely lost.<br>
[0008] The problem of the invention is therefore to produce a document of value<br>
that has increased initial tear resistance and therefore guarantees a high period of cir-<br>
culation, and that remains unchanged in its other typical properties, such as printabil<br>
ity, sound, color, etc.<br>
[0009] In addition, the problem of the invention is to provide a security paper from<br>
which the inventive documents of value can be produced, and to provide methods for<br>
producing the inventive security papers and documents of value.<br>
[0010] The solution to this problem results from the independent claims. Develop-<br>
ments are the subject matter of subclaims.<br>
[0011] According to the invention, the document of value is provided at least in an<br>
edge area at least partly with a reinforcement that prevents initial tear of the document<br>
of value, or at least distinctly delays it compared to prior art documents of value.<br>
[0012] The term "edge area" refers here not only to the one-dimensionally extended<br>
edge itself of the document of value, but also to the two-dimensionally extended mar-<br>
gin area adjoining the edges. The exact dimensions are to be determined by the expert<br>
in the individual case. The reinforced edge area preferably extends parallel to the<br>
edges of the document of value.<br><br>
[0013] The kind of security paper from which the documents of value are made is<br>
not bound to any conditions, so that customary security papers made of fibers from<br>
annuals, in particular cotton fibers, can be used, as well as security papers consisting at<br>
least partly of polymer fibers, preferably polyamide fibers.<br>
[0014] The reinforcement can extend only on part of at least one edge area, but also<br>
over the total length of at least one edge area. Preferably, an edge area is provided with<br>
the reinforcement over its total length. Especially preferably, the opposite edge areas,<br>
in particular those in the longitudinal direction of the document of value, are rein-<br>
forced or, if the production method allows, all edge areas of the document of value are<br>
reinforced. The extension of the reinforcement longitudinally and transversely to the<br>
document of value is to be dimensioned so as to guarantee optimal protection of the<br>
edges, on the one hand, but largely retain the special properties of the document of<br>
value, on the other hand.<br>
[0015] The local position of the reinforcement with respect to the edges to be pro-<br>
tected on the document of value can be realized in different ways. Firstly, it is possible<br>
that the reinforcement incorporated in or applied to the paper is flush with the paper<br>
edge. On the other hand, the reinforcement can also be slightly set in from the rein-<br>
forced edge area, i.e. the reinforcement is not flush with the edge of the document of<br>
value but the paper protrudes beyond the reinforcement. The dimension of the paper<br>
portion protruding beyond the reinforcement depends on, among other things, the in-<br>
tended use of the paper, the kind of paper and/or the degree of stress. In any case, the<br>
tolerable width of the protruding paper portion at which the inventive purpose is pre-<br>
served can be determined by the expert. Besides the possibility of setting in the rein-<br>
forcement, the reinforcement can also protrude beyond the edge area to be reinforced<br>
on the security paper. In this case, the reinforced edges of the document of value do<br>
not consist of paper but of another material.<br>
[0016] The flush, set in and projecting variants of the reinforcement can each be<br>
embedded into the paper, i.e. incorporated at least partly into the volume of the docu-<br>
ment of value, or applied to the paper. With the variants applied to the paper, it is still<br>
possible to apply the reinforcement to only one, i.e. the front or back, side of the secu-<br><br>
rity paper, or to provide the reinforcement on the front and back. If a reinforcement is<br>
provided on the front and back, it can be of identical material, or of course be designed<br>
differently according to the possibilities below.<br>
[0017] Depending on the intended use, the abovementioned possibilities of position-<br>
ing the reinforcement locally within the document of value can also be combined with<br>
each other. For example, a reinforcement set in from the paper edge and embedded<br>
parallel to a first long side of the security element can be combined with a reinforce-<br>
ment projecting over the second long side and applied to the paper. Additionally, the<br>
two short sides of a rectangular document of value could be protected with a flush re-<br>
inforcement incorporated into the paper or applied to the paper. In a preferred em-<br>
bodiment, the reinforcements extend parallel to the longitudinal edge of the document<br>
of value since they can be provided on the security paper by a continuous method.<br>
Other variants that are optionally effected on the finally cut paper are likewise possi-<br>
ble, but more elaborate to produce.<br>
[0018] The manner of reinforcement can be realized in a great number of ways. For<br>
clarity's sake the individual variants will be divided up according to whether the rein-<br>
forcement is applied to the paper or embedded into the paper. A further division results<br>
according to whether the reinforcement is processed on the front and/or back, set in,<br>
flush or projecting and whether there is the possibility of realizing the reinforcement<br>
on one, several, all sides or only on opposite sides.<br>
[0019] The principle of initial tear resistance is fundamentally the same for all vari-<br>
ants described below. The edges endangered e.g. by abutment, bending or active initial<br>
tear on documents of value, in particular bank notes, are protected from excessive me-<br>
chanical stress by a reinforcement. Reinforcements that are flush with the document<br>
edges or even protrude beyond them are especially effective since they completely<br>
shield endangered edges from mechanical attacks. However, the variant with the rein-<br>
forcement set in from the document edge also offers sufficient protection. If someone<br>
attempts to damage a thus equipped bank note, the set in reinforcement offers distinct<br>
resistance to further tear so that the edge area cannot be destroyed. According to the<br><br>
invention the initial tear resistance can also be limited to the areas where bank notes<br>
are exposed to particular loads, for example in the area of the bend creases.<br>
Variant A) Lacquer-reinforced edge area<br>
[0020] The term "lacquer" refers according to the invention to any liquid, pasty or<br>
viscous substance suitable as a printing ink, coating composition or impregnating ma-<br>
terial. It can be applied by basically any printing or paper coating method or any<br>
method for partly applying or transferring the substance to a substrate such as paper.<br>
[0021] With the lacquer-based reinforcement, the lacquer is applied to or incorpo-<br>
rated into the security paper, e.g. by printing or coating methods. Depending on the<br>
adjustment of the lacquer properties and the type of application method, the paper is<br>
either coated with lacquer superficially in the areas to be reinforced, or actually im-<br>
pregnated with lacquer so that the reinforcement is not only present on the surface but<br>
also incorporated into the volume of the paper.<br>
[0022] The lacquer reinforcement can be processed so that the reinforcement is<br>
flush with the paper edge to be reinforced or else accordingly set in.<br>
[0023] Preferably, the dimensions of the reinforced paper area run parallel to the<br>
edges of the document of value, i.e. the paper has a band- or strip-shaped reinforce-<br>
ment. It is also possible to form the reinforced area in a wedge or trapezoidal shape.<br>
[0024] It is possible to process only one side, i.e. the front or back, of the paper or<br>
of course both sides of the paper.<br>
[0025] In regard to the edge areas to be reinforced, all possibilities are available.<br>
For example, only part of an edge area can be reinforced, or else the edge area over the<br>
total paper length. Likewise, several edge areas can be reinforced regardless of their<br>
position relative to each other. However, the reinforced edge areas are preferably lo-<br>
cated opposite and relate to the long sides of the security paper, so that the greatest<br>
possible edge length and the most stressed edges are protected in the finished docu-<br>
ment of value. The lacquer reinforcement preferably has a width of from about 1 to 20<br><br>
millimeters, especially preferably from 2 to 10 millimeters, in particular preferably of<br>
5 millimeters.<br>
[0026] The lacquers used can be water or solvent-based, one or multicomponent<br>
systems. Suitable lacquers are based on natural and synthetic binders, styrene butadi-<br>
ene latex, acrylic latex, rubber-containing coating compounds, emulsion polymers,<br>
two-component polyurethanes, dispersions, etc. The lacquer is preferably a curable<br>
resin composition which is for example chemically or radiation curing, preferably UV<br>
curing.<br>
[0027] The lacquer wets the fibers in the surface area of the paper and forms a com-<br>
plete surface film over the fiber. This maximizes cohesion between the individual fi-<br>
bers while at the same time minimizing access of dirt to the fiber as a positive side-<br>
effect.<br>
[0028] If the lacquer is to penetrate into the paper, this can be optimized in a great<br>
variety of ways.<br>
[0029] For example, a laser or corona treatment can obtain a selective opening of<br>
the paper surface so that the applied lacquer penetrates more easily into the paper. The<br>
laser or corona treatment can be controlled so as to adjust any intermediate stage from<br>
slight roughening of the paper surface to perforation of the paper.<br>
[0030] Further, a watermark can be incorporated into the paper in the area of the re-<br>
inforcement. In the area of the watermark the paper has thinner and thicker places. If<br>
the paper is lacquered in this area the lacquer can penetrate into the paper more easily<br>
in the area of the thin places. The thus reinforced area is actually plasticized in the<br>
process. Lacquering can be done on one or both sides. Depending on the nature of the<br>
lacquer and the paper and the desired reinforcement effect, one-sided lacquering might<br>
suffice, since at very thin places in the paper in the watermark area the lacquer can<br>
penetrate optimally or even come through on the other side. Penetration of lacquer is<br>
particularly facilitated in the area of a so-called highlight watermark. This is a water-<br>
mark having especially light areas when viewed in transmitted light, i.e. especially thin<br>
paper areas. Lacquering can be done only in the area of the watermark, but of course<br><br>
also on the total paper surface, the actual reinforcement effect according to the inven-<br>
tion being strongest in the area of the watermark.<br>
[0031] In the document of value, for example bank note, the watermark can extend<br>
over the whole area of the document or be located along all edges or only on selected<br>
edges or sections of edges. It can be either set in from the edge or flush with the edge.<br>
[0032] The lacquer is knife-coated or printed onto the security paper after its pro-<br>
duction, i.e. onto the paper web or paper sheet. Printing of the lacquer is preferably<br>
done by screen printing or the flexographic process. This can be done directly subse-<br>
quent to papermaking in the paper machine or in a separate operation, for example di-<br>
rectly before or after cutting and/or printing of the security paper.<br>
[0033] Then the inventive security paper is printed and possibly further processed in<br>
accordance with the paper of value to be produced. The lacquer must be applied to the<br>
security paper, and the thus treated security paper cut, such that the lacquer reinforce-.<br>
ment is positioned at the desired places in the document of value to be produced.<br>
[0034] If a document of value with reinforcements flush with the longitudinal edges<br>
is desired, the lacquer is thus applied to the security paper in parallel strips, the strips<br>
being accordingly wide and spaced apart. Cutting of the security paper is then done<br>
e.g. along the center lines of the lacquer strips and at right angles thereto.<br>
[0035] If a document of value is to be produced whose reinforcements are set in<br>
from its edges, parallel extending lacquer strips must likewise be applied to the paper,<br>
the lacquer strips being spaced apart alternately widely and narrowly. The wider spac-<br>
ing specifies the width of the document of value, the narrower spacing the width of the<br>
paper strip protruding over the reinforcement. Cutting is done along the center line<br>
extending between the narrowly spaced strips and at right angles thereto.<br>
[0036] According to a preferred embodiment, the lacquer additionally contains in<br>
low concentration at least one additive with a visually and/or machine detectable<br>
physical property. The additive can have for example magnetic, electroconductive,<br>
luminescent, diffractive, light-polarizing or light-interfering properties. For example, it<br><br>
can comprise interference layer or liquid crystal pigments or other special-effect pig-<br>
ments, such as lustrous metallic effect coloring pigments, etc., or luminescent sub-<br>
stances that are excitable with UV light and emit in the visible spectral region. In the<br>
case of a machine check, however, luminescent substances emitting in the invisible<br>
spectral region, preferably in the IR spectral region, can also be used. Photochromic or<br>
thermochromic additives are likewise conceivable.<br>
[0037] The additive can be present uniformly distributed throughout the coating or<br>
be applied in the form of patterns. For producing the patterns, a composition in the<br>
form of a certain pattern is printed on in a first step, said composition containing in<br>
small quantities in the manner of a doping (less than 1 wt%) at least one additive with<br>
at least one visually and/or machine detectable physical property. The remaining part<br>
of the surface of the paper is provided only in a second step, in register to the first pat-<br>
tern, with the same composition but not containing the detectable additive.<br>
[0038] Instead of physically detectable substances, however, chemically reacting<br>
additives can also be used. For example, a component of a color reaction system can<br>
be added to the lacquer. When the second component of the color reaction system is<br>
applied at a later time, a colored area, pattern, writing or the like becomes visible on<br>
the security paper. This can serve as an authenticity feature or also as a cancellation<br>
mark for a check, ticket or the like.<br>
[0039] The use of a plurality of additives and/or variation of the concentration of<br>
one or more additives permits any desired codings, for example in the form of a bar<br>
code, to be produced very simply on the security paper. Said coding can for example<br>
constitute an independent additional security feature, or serve as a reference feature for<br>
other data already provided on the security paper.<br>
[0040] According to the inventive principle, a plurality of different codings can of<br>
course also be produced. For example, the lacquers containing the particular additive<br>
are applied simultaneously or successively to the paper in the form of the desired cod-<br>
ings. Alternatively, the different codings can be disposed on different surfaces of the<br>
security paper. Double-sided coating with the same additive is of course likewise pos-<br>
sible.<br><br>
[0041] In an especially preferred embodiment, the lacquer is transparent or adapted<br>
to the color of the security paper so that the reinforced area cannot, or hardly, be per-<br>
ceived with the naked eye.<br>
Variant B) Foil-reinforced edge area<br>
[0042] With the foil material based reinforcement, the foil material is at least partly<br>
applied to the paper or embedded into the paper.<br>
[0043] The foil material can be processed so that the reinforcement is flush with the<br>
paper edge to be reinforced or is accordingly set in. In this embodiment there is also<br>
the possibility that the foil material protrudes over the edge to be reinforced on the pa-<br>
per.<br>
[0044] In the variant with foil material applied to the paper, the front and/or back of<br>
the paper can be equipped with foil material.<br>
[0045] In regard to the edge areas to be reinforced, there are different possibilities<br>
depending on the production method. If the reinforcements are laminated to the paper,<br>
part of an edge area can be reinforced, for example, or else the edge area over the total<br>
paper length. A plurality of edge areas can likewise be reinforced regardless of their<br>
position relative to each other. However, the reinforced edge areas are preferably lo-<br>
cated opposite and relate to the long sides of the document of value, so that the great-<br>
est possible edge length and most stressed edges are protected in the finished docu-<br>
ment of value.<br>
[0046] If the foil reinforcements are embedded into the paper, this is done during<br>
papermaking. The security paper is usually made on a cylinder paper machine, to<br>
which foil material is supplied in the area of the stock feed so that foil material is in-<br>
corporated into the sheet during sheet formation. The production method can be con-<br>
trolled so that foil material is embedded completely into the paper, designed as a win-<br>
dowed thread or incorporated in the form of a strip separating the individual paper<br>
strips. To guarantee improved cohesion between paper and foil material, the foil mate-<br>
rial can additionally be adhesive-coated. When the finished paper web is cut, cutting<br><br>
can be controlled so that the foil material is flush with the paper edge, set in or projects<br>
over the paper edge in the finished document of value. If band-shaped foil material,<br>
e.g. strip-shaped material, is incorporated, the foil material normally travels parallel<br>
with the fiber direction of the paper. Consequently, one or at most two edge areas,<br>
namely the parallel edge areas, will have the foil reinforcement depending on cut in<br>
the long grain or the short grain. To achieve reinforcements embedded into the paper<br>
in all edge areas in the finished paper of value, e.g. bank note, grid-shaped reinforce-<br>
ments will preferably be embedded into the security paper. Grid-shaped reinforce-<br>
ments refer to flat shaped articles that are comparable with a large-meshed grid, the<br>
mesh width of said grid corresponding e.g. approximately to the size of the paper of<br>
value. The grid itself is constructed for example of strip-shaped foil material, the indi-<br>
vidual strips extending parallel and perpendicular to each other.<br>
[0047] Preferably, the dimensions of the reinforced paper area run parallel to the<br>
edges of the security paper, i.e. the paper has a band- or strip-shaped reinforcement.<br>
[0048] Foil material according to the invention refers to any suitable material that<br>
increases the initial tear resistance of the document of value in the edge area. The term<br>
"foil material" is not intended to mean any limitation to plastic materials, although<br>
these are preferably used. Rather, this term is intended to indicate that the foil material<br>
should be a relatively thin material so that the appearance of the security paper or<br>
document of value and its properties, in particular in regard to its processibility, are not<br>
negatively affected. However, the use of thicker material is not excluded in general.<br>
[0049] The foil material is preferably tear-resistant material, preferably foil made of<br>
plastic, metal or a plastic-metal laminate. Depending on the manner of use, the foil<br>
material is designed to be transparent or adapted to the color of the security paper or<br>
document of value so that, the foil material is as inconspicuous as possible or, as far as<br>
possible, practically imperceptible with the naked eye. For special uses, in particular in<br>
embodiments where the reinforcement is visible on the surface of the security paper,<br>
the foil material is optionally equipped with further security features, such as holo-<br>
grams, Kinegrams® or other diffraction structures, or printing inks containing interfer-<br>
ence layer or liquid crystal pigments or other special-effect pigments, such as lustrous<br><br>
metallic effect coloring pigments, etc. Additionally, the transitions from foil material<br>
to paper can be overprinted with a printed pattern, in particular by intaglio printing.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the foil material can be equipped with the additives de-<br>
scribed under variant A).<br>
[0050] If a pure plastic thread is involved the foil material used is preferably polyes-<br>
ter; as a metal foil aluminum-coated plastic foil is preferred.<br>
[0051] In a further variant, the foil reinforcements consist of one or more layers<br>
transferred by the transfer method. Preferably, these are reinforcements with embossed<br>
holograms consisting substantially of an embossed plastic layer, a metal layer and an<br>
adhesive layer.<br>
[0052] The foil material can likewise involve netlike structures. Said netlike struc-<br>
tures can consist of natural, polymer and/or glass fibers, the fibers preferably being<br>
welded together, glued, interwoven or plaited. If desired, the structures can be accord-<br>
ingly colored. This can be done by printing, spraying or vapor-deposition, in particular<br>
in a vacuum, preferably using suitable masks. The polymer fibers can be produced<br>
with a diameter of a few microns. A fiber diameter between about 1 micron and about<br>
40 microns is preferred.<br>
[0053] For equipping with additional security features and additives, the possibili-<br>
ties described under variant A) and those described for the above-described foil mate-<br>
rial apply to the same degree.<br>
Variant C) Special fiber reinforced edge area<br>
[0054] A further possibility of reinforcing edge areas of documents of value is to<br>
incorporate special fibers in the endangered areas during papermaking.<br>
[0055] i) Firstly, these are fibers having increased tear strength in comparison with<br>
the fibers used for the basic substrate, without any further treatment of the<br>
fibers being necessary before or after incorporation into the paper pulp. This<br>
does not exclude additional pre- or aftertreatment, however. These special<br>
fibers are in particular synthetic fibers, or synthetic fibers incorporated into<br><br>
the paper web as endless threads, or fibers of especially long form with a<br>
length of several millimeters that are incorporated into the paper pulp. It is of<br>
course also possible to use synthetic fibers of endless form and mixtures of<br>
endless synthetic fibers with fibers of long form.<br>
The fiber reinforcement can be incorporated into the security paper so that<br>
the reinforcement is flush with the paper edge to be reinforced, set in, or pro-<br>
jects accordingly in the finished document of value.<br>
Preferably, the dimensions of the reinforced paper area run parallel to the<br>
edges of the security paper, i.e. the paper has a band- or strip-shaped rein-<br>
forcement. The spatial arrangement of the reinforcement and the cut of the<br>
security paper are effected according to a similar principle as the designs de-<br>
scribed under variant A).<br>
The special fibers can be supplied to the paper pulp e.g. in the area of the<br>
headbox via a separate inlet. On the one hand, the inflow of special fibers<br>
can be regulated so that the paper pulp containing the original "normal" fi-<br>
bers is enriched with the special fibers in the area of the inflow; on the other<br>
hand, the special fibers can replace the "normal" fibers by 100% in the area<br>
of the inflow.<br>
ii) Secondly, the special fibers are fibers that are preprocessed by beating<br>
such that a dense, strong sheet with increased initial tear resistance is formed<br>
in the area where said fibers are used, during the actual papermaking. For<br>
this purpose, wet beating can be performed so that the fibers are crushed and<br>
defibrillated. This causes hydration of the fiber and enlargement of the spe-<br>
cific surface. The contact surfaces of the fibers within the sheet increase<br>
considerably so that hydrogen bridges can form that cause the strength of the<br>
fiber structure. Alternatively, chemical beating of the fibers can be effected,<br>
i.e. additives are used that act as a lubricant during beating, increase the con-<br>
tact area between fibers and produce intimate contact between fibers and fi-<br>
brils on the molecular scale. The choice of beating, of the degree of beating<br>
and of the duration of beating and the specific conditions for increasing the<br><br>
strength of the fibrous composite are to be adapted to the particular fibers<br>
used, and determined by the expert.<br>
The thus pretreated fibers can be incorporated into the security paper locally<br>
and technically like the special fibers under i). The special fibers can consist<br>
of the same kind of fiber as used for the basic substrate or be different there-<br>
from. If cotton fibers are used, for example, the total document of value can<br>
consist of cotton fibers but in the area of the reinforcement there are cotton<br>
fibers that have been subjected to special beating.<br>
iii) Further, the special fibers are fibers that are subjected to aftertreatment<br>
after being incorporated into the paper during its production, and acquire in-<br>
creased tear strength through said aftertreatment. The fibers can be e.g. ther-<br>
moplastic fibers that are fused together by the action of heat. However, any<br>
other chemical or physical process can be used that causes crosslinking,<br>
fusion, welding, gluing, etc., of the fibers used. For example, the desired re-<br>
inforcement can be achieved by gluing, the action of solvents or the trigger-<br>
ing of chemical crosslinking reactions.<br>
The fibers requiring aftertreatment can be incorporated into the security pa-<br>
per locally and technically like the special fibers under i). Besides the possi-<br>
bility of incorporating the fibers into the paper only in the area of the rein-<br>
forcement, the security paper can be equipped with said special fibers over<br>
the whole area, the aftertreatment being done only locally in the margin ar-<br>
eas to be reinforced. Whole-area treatment has the great disadvantage over<br>
such locally limited treatment that the paper to be processed is exposed to<br>
external influences, such as heat treatment by a heated roller, in its whole<br>
surface and thus strongly impaired over the whole area. In contrast, only the<br>
margin area is treated according to the invention, thereby guaranteeing effec-<br>
tive initial tear resistance while saving energy, chemicals, time and thus<br>
costs. If, for example, a paper web is present with special fibers incorporated<br>
in a strip shape, which can be crosslinked thermally, the required thermal<br>
energy can be transferred to the paper easily likewise in a strip shape using<br><br>
an accordingly narrow heated roller, a laser, an infrared source, etc., after<br>
papermaking<br>
[0063] The special fibers under i) to iii) can additionally be equipped with the addi-<br>
tives described under variant A), it being possible to incorporate a coding into the edge<br>
area of the document of value by a combination of additives. For example, a separate<br>
feed of differently equipped fibers to the paper pulp could produce two strips located<br>
side by side and running parallel in an edge area. If the fibers are fibers with e.g. dif-<br>
ferent luminescent properties, a kind of simple bar code can be generated in this way.<br>
It is also possible to supplement the coding via different width of the strips. The spe-<br>
cial fibers under i) to iii) can moreover be used not only singly but also in any con-<br>
ceivable combination or mixture.<br>
Variant D) Further components to promote durability<br>
[0064] In addition to reinforcing the edge areas, the durability of the security paper<br>
can be increased further by performing the following measures singly or in combina-<br>
tion:<br>
[0065] i) In the production of security paper, in particular bank note paper, the basic<br>
substrate used is customarily a paper with a weight of 90 to 95 grams per<br>
square meter. In the inventive security papers a thicker paper can instead be<br>
used with e.g. 100 grams per square meter. The higher weight per unit area<br>
and resulting higher thickness of the paper already causes a reinforcement of<br>
the security paper to be obtained, without any substantial impairment of the<br>
properties desired in particular for bank notes.<br>
[0066] ii) The use of double-sided steel printing on the security paper increases the<br>
compression and thus stability of the paper substrate.<br>
[0067] iii) The security paper, but above all the printed security paper, can addition-<br>
ally be lacquered to protect the print and the paper from soiling. The lacquer<br>
layer is preferably coordinated in its composition with the inventive lacquer<br>
layer, if present, to permit a good bond of the two layers. The bond can pos-<br><br>
sibly be improved further by an additional crosslinking step. This can be ef-<br>
fected by the action of heat or irradiation (e.g. with UV radiation).<br>
[0068] Variants A) to D) can be used singly but also in any desired combination for<br>
increasing durability, in particular initial tear strength.<br>
[0069] The inventive security paper can for example also be used advantageously<br>
for producing ID cards and passports. Since it has increased tear resistance and dirt<br>
resistance, the usual lamination with plastic foils might be omitted. This eliminates an<br>
elaborate additional step, thereby obtaining a considerable time and cost saving.<br>
[0070] Due to the increased initial tear strength along with high tear propagation re-<br>
sistance of paper, the present invention provides an extremely durable security paper.<br>
Looking at the European and North American regions and disregarding tropical zones,<br>
the period of circulation of an inventive bank note may be more than three times the<br>
period of circulation of a conventional bank note.<br>
[0071] Hereinafter some examples of the inventive security paper will be explained:<br>
Example 1 Foil-reinforced edge area (net-shaped structure)<br>
[0072] A square grid cloth of 5 micron thick polypropylene fibers with a mesh<br>
width of 0.1 millimeters is incorporated into the paper material in the form of bands<br>
spaced 10 centimeters apart and with all-over cover during the dipping process in the<br>
production of bank note paper. The polypropylene fibers are colored in a color close to<br>
the paper.<br>
Example 2 Foil-reinforced edge area (strip-shaped plastic foil)<br>
[0073] 3 millimeter wide and 15 micron thick transparent polyester strips are sup-<br>
plied to the drum of a cylinder paper machine alternately spaced 6 and 1 centimeters<br>
so that the foil strips are embedded into the paper during sheet formation. Subsequent<br>
to completion of the paper web, the latter is cut in the middle between the 1 centimeter<br>
spaced foil strips and at right angles thereto at a spacing of 12 centimeters. The result<br><br>
is a 12 centimeter by 7 centimeter document of value with two foil reinforcements ex-<br>
tending parallel to the longitudinal edges and set in 0.5 centimeters therefrom.<br>
Example 3 Synthetic fiber reinforced edge area<br>
[0074] Special fibers, namely polyamide fibers, and cotton fibers are processed in a<br>
Willcox plant so as to produce a paper web having strips with a width of 2 centimeters<br>
and extending at a spacing of 6 centimeters, and the fiber composition of said strips is<br>
not 100% cotton fibers but 50% cotton fibers and 50% synthetic fibers. In the remain-<br>
ing area of the paper web there are 100% cotton fibers. The paper web is optionally<br>
printed after production and cut so as to yield bank notes with a length of 16 centime-<br>
ters and a width of 8 centimeters, the polymer fiber reinforcement extending along the<br>
longitudinal edges of the bank note and flush therewith.<br>
[0075] Further advantages and embodiments will be explained in more detail with<br>
reference to the figures. It is pointed out that the figures show the layer structure of the<br>
inventive security paper or document of value only schematically.<br>

[0085] Fig. 9 shows the schematic representation of a two cylinder paper machine<br>
for producing a security paper.<br>
[0086] Fig. 1 shows inventive document of value 1. Such a document of value is<br>
usually made of cotton fibers or other fibers from annuals. For some applications,<br>
however, it can be expedient to replace part of said natural fibers by polymer fibers, in<br>
particular polyamide fibers. During production of security paper 7 inventive rein-<br>
forcements 3a, 3b shown in Fig. 1 are already embedded into the paper. If desired, in-<br>
dividual security elements, for example portrait watermark 2, are additionally incorpo-<br>
rated during production. Reinforcements 3a, 3b can be any of variants A) to C). In the<br>
present case, document of value 1 was provided with flush reinforcement 3a at the top<br>
edge and with set in reinforcement 3b at the bottom edge. However, the reinforce-<br>
ments are preferably formed symmetrically, i.e. either both reinforcements set in or .<br>
aligned flush with the edge of the document of value. Width d of the reinforcements<br>
depends on, among other things, the material to be processed for the reinforcements<br>
and the desired purpose. The more tear-resistant the material for the reinforcements is,<br>
the narrower the reinforcement can be. With use of plastic strips, in particular polyes-<br>
ter, width d ranges preferably from 1 to 10 millimeters, especially preferably from 2 to<br>
3 millimeters. Distance x of the reinforcement from the edge of the document of value<br>
likewise depends on the materials used. Preferably, "x" ranges between 0 and 5 milli-<br>
meters, whereby values of 0 and 2 millimeters are especially preferred. The values for<br>
"d" and "x" are in any case to be selected so as to achieve the inventive purpose,<br>
namely reinforcement of the edge areas. These values can be determined by the expert<br>
by suitable tests.<br>
[0087] Fig. 2 shows a section through inventive document of value 1 along dash-<br>
dotted line A-A in Fig. 1. The embodiments of inventive reinforcements 3a, 3b shown<br>
in Fig. 2 are lacquer reinforcements that have been knife-coated or printed all over in<br>
two strip-shaped areas of document of value 1. Reinforcement 3a has been applied to<br>
security paper 7 on both sides. The lacquer of reinforcement 3b is additionally doped<br><br>
with additive 4 which is visually and/or machine testable. The additive can be for ex-<br>
ample a luminescent substance transparent under normal lighting that emits in the visi-<br>
ble spectral region when irradiated with UV light and thus shows an intensive color<br>
tone. In this case the luminescence is only visible under UV lighting. However, a plu-<br>
rality of additives can also be provided that are individually detectable. The mixture<br>
ratio of the additives can serve e.g. to produce a coding.<br>
[0088] Fig. 3 shows a section through document of value 1 comparable to that in<br>
Fig. 1, along dash-dotted line A-A. The embodiments of inventive reinforcements 3a,<br>
3b shown in Fig. 3 are foil reinforcements that are applied, e.g. glued, in two strip-<br>
shaped areas of document of value 1. Reinforcement 3a has been applied to security<br>
paper 7 on both sides in such a way that foil material protrudes over the edge of the<br>
finished document of value. Width y of the protruding foil and width z of the overlap<br>
depend on the reinforcement materials used. The values for "y" are advantageously<br>
within the range of about 0.1 to 10 millimeters, the value for "z" should be at least<br>
about 1 millimeter, preferably 5 millimeters. The foil material in Fig. 3 is a plastic foil<br>
of polyester. Width d of reinforcement 3a is 7 millimeters with "z" equal to 5 millime-<br>
ters and "y" equal to 2 millimeters. Width d of reinforcement 3b is 3 millimeters with<br>
"x" equal to 2 millimeters. The foil material can additionally be doped with additive 4<br>
which is visually and/or machine testable. For example, the foil can also be equipped<br>
with additional optical security elements such as holograms, Kinegrams® or other dif-<br>
fraction structures, but also printing inks containing interference layer or liquid crystal<br>
pigments or other special-effect pigments, such as lustrous metallic effect coloring<br>
pigments, iridescent pigments, etc.<br>
[0089] Fig. 4 shows inventive document of value 1 into which strip-shaped foil ma-<br>
terial 5 was already incorporated during papermaking. Foil material 5 is quasi embed-<br>
ded into the paper, so that it is embedded completely into the paper pulp in the areas<br>
marked by dash lines. This strip can be provided with any machine-readable security<br>
features, such as an electroconductive, metallic layer or the like. However, it is pref-<br>
erably a polyester band which is of transparent design or given the color of security<br>
paper 7 or document of value 1 so that it is preferably hardly or not at all visible. The<br>
foil strips of this embodiment are about 2 to 3 millimeters wide (d) and set in about 2<br><br>
to 3 millimeters (x) from the edge of the document of value. The thickness of the foil<br>
ranges from about 10 to 50 microns, and is preferably about 15 microns.<br>
[0090] Fig. 5 shows inventive document of value 1 into which polymer fibers 6<br>
were already incorporated during papermaking so as to be flush with the edge of the<br>
document of value. The polymer fibers are polypropylene fibers. Width d of the rein-<br>
forcement by polymer fibers advantageously has a value between 0.5 and 10 millime-<br>
ters.<br>
[0091] Fig. 6a shows a detail of inventive security paper web 7 as used for example<br>
for producing bank notes. Strip-shaped reinforcements 8 were applied to paper web 7<br>
on the front side of the paper web after papermaking. Reinforcements 8 can be for ex-<br>
ample laminated-on plastic foils, a printed-on lacquer layer or embedded special fi-<br>
bers. The width of the reinforcements on the paper web must be twice as great, i.e. 2 x<br>
d, as width d desired in the finally cut note. Number I designates the area where rein-<br>
forcements overlap with paper, and number II designates the area where paper is pres-<br>
ent without reinforcement. Cutting paper web 7 along the dashed lines yields e.g. bank<br>
notes having reinforcements running parallel along the longitudinal edges and flush<br>
therewith.<br>
[0092] Fig. 6b shows a section through inventive security paper web 7 along dash-<br>
dotted line B-B in Fig. 6a.<br>
[0093] Fig. 7a shows a detail of inventive security paper web 7 as used for example<br>
for producing bank notes. Strip-shaped reinforcements 9 were embedded into paper<br>
web 7 during papermaking. Reinforcements 9 can be for example strip-shaped plastic<br>
foils with e.g. perforated edges or net-shaped structures. The width of the reinforce-<br>
ments on the paper web must be twice as great, i.e. 2 x d, as width d desired in the f-<br>
nally cut note. Number I designates the area where reinforcements are embedded into<br>
paper, number II designates the area where paper is present without reinforcement, and<br>
number III designates the area where only reinforcement is present. Cutting paper web<br>
7 along the dashed lines yields e.g. bank notes having reinforcements running parallel<br>
along the long sides and protruding over the longitudinal edges of the bank note.<br><br>
[0094] Fig. 7b shows a section through inventive security paper web 7 along dash-<br>
dotted line B-B in Fig. 7a.<br>
[0095] Fig. 8a shows a detail of inventive security paper web 7 as used for example<br>
for producing bank notes. Grid-shaped reinforcement 18 was already embedded into<br>
paper web 7 during papermaking, so that it is embedded completely into the paper<br>
pulp in the areas shown by dotted lines. Grid-shaped reinforcement 18 can consist e.g.<br>
of above-described foil material, preferably of plastic foils or netlike structures. The<br>
grid-shaped reinforcement can be provided with any machine-readable security fea-<br>
tures, such as an electroconductive, metallic layer or the like. The width of the rein-<br>
forcements on the paper web must be twice as great, i.e. 2 x d, as width d desired in<br>
the finally cut note. Number I designates the area where reinforcements are embedded<br>
into paper, number II designates the area where paper is present without reinforce-<br>
ment. Cutting paper web 7 along the dashed lines yields e.g. bank notes having rei-<br>
forcements running along all sides, i.e. the longitudinal and transverse sides, and flush<br>
therewith.<br>
[0096] Fig. 8b shows a section through inventive security paper web 7 along dash-<br>
dotted line B-B in Fig. 8a.<br>
[0097] Fig. 9 shows the schematic representation of a two cylinder paper machine<br>
as used for producing the inventive security paper. The plant comprises two cylinder<br>
paper machines 10 and 11. Paper web 13 is formed in paper machine 10 on cylinder<br>
12. Paper machine 11 is used to make second paper web 14 simultaneously with pro-<br>
duction of paper web 13. Paper webs 13 and 14 are removed from cylinders 12, 16<br>
using so-called "pickup felts" 15, interconnected in the area of pressure roll 17 and<br>
supplied together to the further processing stations (calender, paper sizing, etc.) of the<br>
manufacturing plant. To produce the security paper shown in Figs. 8a and 8b, grid-<br>
shaped foil material 18 is additionally supplied between paper webs 13 and 14 in the<br>
area of pressure roll 17, so that grid-shaped foil material 18 is embedded into the fin-<br>
ished security paper.<br><br>
