STRUCTURE FOR THE FILTRATION OF A GAS BASED ON SILICON<br>
CARBIDE WITH A CONTROLLED WALL SURFACE POROSITY<br>
The invention relates to the field of filtering structures,<br>
which may comprise a catalytic component, used for example<br>
in an exhaust line of an internal combustion engine of the<br>
diesel type.<br>
Filters for the treatment of gases and for eliminating soot<br>
particles typically coming from a diesel engine are well<br>
known in the prior art. These structures usually all have a<br>
honeycomb structure, one of the faces of the structure<br>
allowing entry of the exhaust gases to be treated and the<br>
other face for exit of the treated exhaust gases. The.<br>
structure comprises, between the entry and exit faces, an<br>
assembly of adjacent ducts or channels, whose axes are<br>
parallel to one other, separated by porous walls. The ducts<br>
are sealed off at one or other of their ends in order to<br>
form inlet chambers opening onto the entry face and outlet<br>
chambers opening onto the exit face. The channels are<br>
alternately closed off in an order such that, in the course<br>
of their passage through the honeycomb body, the exhaust<br>
gases are forced to pass through the sidewalls of the inlet<br>
channels in order to rejoin the outlet channels. In this<br>
way, the particulates or soot particles are deposited and<br>
accumulate on the porous walls of the filter body.<br>
Currently, for gas filtration, filters made from a porous<br>
ceramic material are used, for example made from cordierite,<br>
from alumina, from mullite, from silicon nitride, from a<br>
silicon/silicon carbide mixture or from silicon carbide.<br>
In a known manner, during use, the particulate filter is<br>
subjected to a succession of filtration (soot accumulation)<br>
and regeneration (soot elimination) phases. During the<br>
filtration phases, the soot particles emitted by the engine<br>
are retained and deposited inside the filter. During the<br><br>
regeneration phases, the soot particles are burnt off inside<br>
the filter, in order to restore its filtering properties to<br>
it. One important criterion involved in the implementation<br>
of a filter, for example in the exhaust line of an engine,<br>
is therefore its thermomechanical resistance.<br>
It is furthermore known that the introduction of a<br>
particulate filter such as previously described into the<br>
exhaust line of an engine leads to a pressure drop likely to<br>
impair the performance parameters of the latter.<br>
Consequently, the filter must be configured in such a manner<br>
as to avoid such an impairment.<br>
Another critical criterion for the selection of the,<br>
optionally, catalytic filtering structures previously<br>
described is their soot deposition time. This time<br>
corresponds to the time period required for the filter to<br>
reach its maximum filtering efficiency level, when it is<br>
first implemented or following a regeneration phase. It is<br>
assumed that this time depends, in particular, on the<br>
deposition of a sufficient quantity of soot within the<br>
porosity of the filter in order to impede the direct passage<br>
of fine soot particles through the walls of the filter. One<br>
of the direct consequences of a maladapted soot deposition<br>
time is the appearance of persistent and noxious black<br>
fumes, together with the presence of traces of soot at the<br>
outlet of the exhaust line, on a new filter or after a<br>
regeneration phase. It goes without saying that, for reasons<br>
of environmental impact, of image and of comfort of use,<br>
automobile manufacturers would like the occurrence of such<br>
phenomena to be eliminated or at least minimized on vehicles<br>
fitted with such filters.<br>
The deposition of soot is a poorly understood phenomenon,<br>
owing without doubt to the fact that the mass of deposit is<br>
not measurable in real time on a filter during use. Indeed,<br>
only the soot deposition time, measured indirectly based on<br><br>
the analysis of the concentration of particulates present in<br>
the exhaust gases at the outlet of the filter, is<br>
accessible.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of silicon<br>
carbide filters, preferably obtained by<br>
sintering/recrystallization (R-SiC). -Examples of catalytic<br>
filters according to the invention are for example described<br>
in the patent applications EP 816 065, EP, 1 142 619, EP 1<br>
455 923 or else WO 2004/065088 to which reference will be<br>
made for a more detailed description of their structure or -<br>
their mode of synthesis. The structures according to the<br>
invention may be simple monolithic structures or,<br>
preferably, more complex assembled structures, usually<br>
obtained by the association of several monolithic elements,<br>
bonded by a cement referred to as sealing cement.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to provide a<br>
novel honeycomb structure, possibly comprising a catalytic<br>
component, that allows all of the aforementioned problems to<br>
be solved.<br>
The invention thus relates to a filtering structure<br>
combining, for a maximum filtration efficiency and long-term<br>
use, the following properties:	<br>
-	a minimum pressure drop during operation, typically on<br>
an exhaust line of an internal combustion engine;<br>
-	a thermomechanical resistance sufficient to withstand<br>
the operational constraints of the filter; and<br>
an optimized filtering efficiency as soon as the<br>
filter is implemented or after a regeneration phase,<br>
resulting in a minimized soot deposition time.<br>
Such a structure is especially applicable as a particulate<br>
filter in an exhaust line of a diesel or gasoline engine.<br>
In its most general form, the present invention relates to a<br><br>
structure for filtering particulate-laden gases, of the<br>
honeycomb type and comprising an assembly of adjacent ducts<br>
or channels, whose axes are parallel to one another,<br>
separated by porous walls, said ducts being sealed off by<br>
plugs at one or other of their ends so as to form inlet<br>
chambers opening onto a gas entry face and outlet chambers<br>
opening onto a gas exit face, in such a way that the gas to<br>
be filtered passes through the porous walls, said structure being characterized in that the material based on silicon<br>
carbide constituting said walls has:<br>
-	an open porosity of between 30 and 53%, preferably<br>
between 40 and 50% and very preferably between 43 and 49%;<br>
-	a median pore diameter of between 9 and 20 urn,<br>
preferably between 12 and 18 µm;<br>
and in that:<br>
-	the average number of open pores on the surface of the<br>
walls, the opening area of which is between 20 and 310 µm2,<br>
is greater than 300 per mm2 of wall, preferably greater than<br>
350 per mm2 of wall; and<br>
the ratio of the total opening area of said open<br>
pores to said area of the walls is between 0.15 and 0.30,<br>
preferably between 0.20 and 0.27.<br>
The term "SiC-based material" is understood within the<br>
context of the present description to mean that said<br>
material comprises at least 30% SiC by weight, preferably at<br>
least 70% SiC by weight and very preferably at least 98% SiC<br>
by weight.<br>
The term "median pore diameter" is understood within the<br>
context of the present description to mean the pore diameter<br>
for which 50% by volume of the pores is equal to or less<br>
than-this pore size.<br>
The open pores on the surface of the walls, the opening area<br>
of which is between 20 and 310 µm2, are, within the context<br>
of the present description, the pores of which the opening<br><br>
area on the channels corresponds approximately to the area<br>
of a perfect disk, the diameter of which is between about<br>
5 µm and about 20 µm.<br>
The structure according to the invention may further include a catalytic coating for treating pollutant gases of the CO<br>
or HC type, coating being present for example on the surface<br>
and in the porosity of the walls.<br>
The thickness of the walls of the structures according to<br>
the invention is typically between 200 and 500 µm.<br>
In general, the pore size distribution is of a unimodal<br>
type.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
present filtering structure comprises a plurality of<br>
honeycomb filtering elements joined together by a jointing<br>
cement, the number of channels typically being around 7.75<br>
to 62 per cm2, said channels having a cross section ranging<br>
from 0.5 to 9 mm2.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for manufacturing<br>
the above-described SiC-based filtering structures, which<br>
comprises: a step of mixing the initial mixture with at<br>
least one pore-forming agent, preferably chosen from the<br>
group consisting of polyethylene, polystyrene, starch and<br>
graphite, for example as described in applications JP 08-<br>
281036 or EP 1 541 538. The mixing results in a homogeneous<br>
product in the form of a bound, paste. The process further<br>
includes a step of extruding said product through a suitable<br>
die so as to form honeycomb monoliths; a step of drying the<br>
monoliths obtained; and, optionally, an assembly step and a<br>
firing step, said process being characterized in that at<br>
least one of the parameters within the group consisting of<br>
the size of the particles of the initial mixture, the nature<br>
and the amount of the pore-forming agent (s) and the firing<br><br>
temperature, is controlled so as to obtain said structure.<br>
According to one possible method of implementation, the<br>
silicon carbide is introduced in the form of a powder, said<br>
powder having at least two types of particle size, for<br>
example in the form of a first population of particles, the<br>
median diameter of which is between 10 and 100 urn, preferably<br>
between 10 and 50 µm, and a second population of particles,<br>
the median diameter of which is between 0.1 and 10 µm,<br>
preferably between 0.1 and 5 µm.<br>
Advantageously, the firing temperature is adjusted for the<br>
requirements of the present invention to between 2100 and<br>
2400°C, and preferably between 2150 and 2300°C.<br>
The process may further include, but not necessarily, a step<br>
of depositing, preferably by impregnation, a catalytic<br>
coating comprising an active catalytic phase, typically<br>
consisting of at least one precious metal such as Pt and/or<br>
Rh and/or Pd, and optionally an oxide such as CeO2, ZrO2,<br>
CeO2-ZrO2-<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to the use of the<br>
structure described above as a particulate filter in an<br>
exhaust line of a diesel or gasoline engine.<br>
The invention and its advantages will be better understood<br>
on reading the following nonlimiting examples:<br>
the filters in the following examples were synthesized<br>
starting from an initial mixture of the four following<br>
constituents:<br>
constituent A: a first powder composed of. SiC<br>
particles whose median diameter d50 varies between 5 and<br>
50 µm, at least 10% by weight of the particles having a<br>
diameter greater than 5 µm;<br><br>
constituent B: a second powder composed of SiC<br>
particles of median diameter d50 in the range between 0.1 and<br>
10 µm;<br>
constituent C: a pore-forming agent of the<br>
polyethylene type; and<br>
constituent D: an organic binder of the methyl<br>
cellulose - type.<br>
Example 1;<br>
A first particulate filter was synthesized and tested.<br>
Firstly, 50 parts by weight of constituent A composed of a<br>
powder of SiC particles with median diameter d50 of around<br>
30 µm and 50 parts by weight of constituent B with a median<br>
diameter of the SiC particles of around 2.5 µm were mixed in<br>
a mixer.<br>
Secondly, 5% by weight of constituent C with respect to the<br>
total mass of the constituents A and B and 5% by weight of<br>
constituent D with respect to the total mass of constituents<br>
A and B were added to this first mixture.<br>
Water was added and mixing was continued until a uniform<br>
paste was obtained whose plasticity allowed it to be<br>
extruded through an extrusion die as monolithic honeycomb<br>
structures whose dimensional characteristics are given in<br>
table 1:<br><br><br>
Subsequently, the green monoliths obtained were dried by<br>
microwave for a time sufficient to bring the proportion of<br>
water not chemically bound to less than 1% by weight.<br>
The channels were alternately closed off on each face of the<br>
monolith according to well-known techniques, for example<br>
those described in application WO 2004/065088.<br>
The monolith was then fired with a temperature rise of<br>
20°C/h until a temperature of around 2200°C was reached,<br>
which was maintained for 2 hours.<br>
A series of silicon carbide monoliths were finally obtained<br>
whose microstructural characteristics depended on the<br>
composition of the initial mixture and on the synthesis<br>
conditions.<br>
The elements coming from one and the same mixture were then<br>
assembled together by bonding with a cement of the ceramic<br>
type and then machined, in order to form filters of 14.4 cm<br>
diameter in accordance with the teaching of patent<br>
application EP 816 065. The filters obtained according to<br>
this example correspond to specimen 1 in table 2.<br><br>
Examples 2 to 12:<br>
In these examples, the filter synthesis protocol described<br>
in example 1 was reproduced in an identical manner.<br>
The differences introduced so as to modify the<br>
microstructural properties of the monoliths obtained were as<br>
follows:<br>
-	various powders whose median particle diameter varied<br>
between 5 and 50 µm were used as constituent A, at least 10%<br>
by weight of the particles making up these powders having a<br>
diameter larger than 5 µm;<br>
-	various powders with a median particle diameter<br>
varying between 0.1 and 10 µm were used as constituent B;<br>
and<br>
-	the proportions of constituents A and B were varied<br>
within the following limits:<br>
Constituent A: from 20 to 80%,<br>
Constituent B: from 80 to 20%, in order to obtain a<br>
first mixture comprising exclusively (100%) constituents A<br>
and B.<br>
Secondly, constituents C and D were then added to each<br>
mixture A and B, in proportions ranging from 3 to 12% and 1<br>
to 20%. by weight, respectively, with respect to. the total<br>
mass of constituents A and B.<br>
The dimensional characteristics of the monoliths obtained<br>
after firing and of the filters obtained after assembly were<br>
identical to those given in example 1. <br>
The specimens obtained were evaluated according to three<br>
different tests:<br>
A- Measurement of the soot deposition time:<br>
The soot deposition time is the time required for the<br>
deposition of a sufficient quantity of soot, on a new filter<br><br>
or following a regeneration, in order for it to reach its<br>
maximum level of filtration efficiency.<br>
For the measurement, the filter to be tested was installed<br>
on an exhaust line of an engine on a test bench. The engine<br>
employed was a diesel engine with a capacity of 2.0 liters.<br>
The filter was progressively loaded with soot by the<br>
operation of the engine at a speed of 3000 rpm at 50 Nm.<br>
The bench was equipped at the exit with an ELPI (Electrical<br>
Low Pressure Impactor) system, known per se, which allowed<br>
the particulate concentration in a gas to be measured in<br>
real time starting from the moment the filter was loaded. A<br>
curve of filtration efficiency as a function of time was<br>
thus obtained, this being characterized by a quasi-plateau<br>
after a given testing time. The plateau corresponds to a<br>
filtration efficiency greater than or equal to 99%. The<br>
period of time between the start of the loading of the<br>
filter and the time from which an efficiency equal to at<br>
least 99% is obtained corresponds, according to the present<br>
invention, to the soot deposition time.<br>
B- Measurement of the pressure drop:<br>
Pressure drop, within the meaning of the present invention,<br>
is understood to mean the differential pressure existing<br>
between the upstream side and the downstream side of the<br>
filter. The pressure drop was measured according to the<br>
techniques of the prior art for an air flow of 300 m3/h in an<br>
ambient air current.<br>
C- Measurement of the thermomechanical resistance:<br>
The filters were mounted on an exhaust line of a 2.0 L<br>
diesel engine running at full power (4000 rpm) for 30<br>
minutes, then dismantled and weighed in order to determine<br>
their initial mass. The filters were then reinstalled on the<br>
engine test bench with a speed of. 3000 rpm and a torque of<br><br>
50 Nm for different periods of time in order to obtain soot<br>
loads of between 1 g/liter and 10 g/1 in the filter.<br>
The filters thus loaded were remounted on the line in order<br>
to undergo an intense regeneration defined as follows: after<br>
stabilization at an engine speed of 1700 rpm at a torque of<br>
95 Nm for 2 minutes, a post-injection was performed with 70°<br>
of phasing for a post-injection flow rate of 18 mmVstroke.<br>
Once the combustion of the soot deposits had been initiated,<br>
more precisely when the pressure drop decreased over a<br>
period of at least 4 seconds, the engine speed was reduced<br>
to 1050 rpm at a torque of 40 Nm for 5 minutes in order to<br>
accelerate the combustion of the soot deposits. The filter<br>
was then subjected to an engine speed of 4000 rpm for 30<br>
minutes in order to eliminate the remaining soot.<br>
The regenerated	filters are inspected after cutting up in<br>
order to reveal	the possible presence of cracks visible to<br>
the naked eye.	The limiting mass of soot thus measured,<br>
defined as the	mass of soot for which the first cracks<br>
appear after	severe regeneration, measures the<br>
thermomechanical	resistance of the filters.<br>
The microstructural characteristics of the samples were<br>
subsequently measured by various techniques which are well<br>
known in the art:<br>
D- Porosimetry of the material forming the walls:<br>
The open porosity of the silicon carbide forming the walls<br>
was determined according to the conventional high-pressure<br>
mercury porosimetry techniques, with a porosimeter of the<br>
Micromeritics 9500 type. The analyses show, for all the<br>
samples tested, a unimodal distribution of the pore sizes.<br>
The median pore diameter was determined using the cumulative<br>
pore volume distribution as a function of the pore size,<br><br>
obtained by porosimetry measurement using the mercury<br>
porosimeter.<br>
E - Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM):<br>
The number, the nature and the size of the pores on the<br>
surface of the walls was determined by an automated image<br>
processing technique on each specimen based on photographs<br>
of a surface area of 1 mm2 of wall taken by a scanning<br>
microscope in BSE (backscattered electron) mode.<br>
The structural data and the results of the various tests<br>
obtained on specimens representative of all of the results<br>
obtained are given in table 2.<br><br><br><br>
In table 2, it may be seen that specimens 1 to 5, which meet<br>
the microstructural criteria according to the invention,<br>
have satisfactory results in the various evaluation tests,<br>
suitable for them to be used as a particulate filter on an<br>
exhaust line of a diesel engine, that is to say, under the<br>
measurement conditions, a soot deposition time of 10 minutes<br>
or less, combined with a pressure drop below 20 pascals and<br>
a limiting soot mass equal to or greater than 4 g/liter. The<br>
measurements on specimens 6 to 9, given by way of<br>
comparison, show that porosity and median pore diameter<br>
values not in accordance with those described above mean<br>
that such structures cannot be used as a particulate filter.<br>
Furthermore, the measurements on specimens 10 to .12, also<br>
given for comparison, show that wall surfaces not according<br>
to the present invention do not allow them to be used as a<br>
particulate filter.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Title: STRUCTURE FOR THE FILTRATION OF A GAS BASED ON SILICON<br>
CARBIDE WITH A CONTROLLED WALL SURFACE POROSITY<br>
A filter for filtering particulate-laden gases, of the honeycomb type and<br>
comprising an assembly of adjacent ducts or channels, whose axes are parallel<br>
to one another, separated by porous walls, said ducts being sealed off by plugs<br>
at one or other of their ends so as to form inlet chambers opening onto a gas<br>
entry face and outlet chambers opening onto a gas exit face, in such a way that<br>
the gas to be filtered passes through the porous walls, said filter being<br>
characterized in that the material based on silicon carbide constituting said walls<br>
has: an open porosity of between 30 and 53%, preferably between 40 and 50%<br>
and very preferably between 43 and 49%; a median pore diameter of between 9<br>
and 20 µm, preferably between 12 and 18 µm; and in that: the average number<br>
of open pores on the surface of the walls, the opening area of which is between<br>
20 and 310 µm2, is greater than 300 per mm2 of wall, preferably greater than 350<br>
per mm2 of wall; and the ratio of the total opening area of said open pores to said<br>
area of the walls is between 0.15 and 0.30, preferably between 0.20 and 0.27.</td>
