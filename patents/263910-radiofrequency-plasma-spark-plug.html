RADIOFREQUENCY PLASMA SPARK PLUG<br>
	The present invention relates in general to<br>
	radiofrequency plasma spark plugs.<br>
5<br>
	More specifically, the invention relates to a spark<br>
	plug, known as a radiofrequency plasma spark plug,<br>
	intended to equip a combustion chamber of an internal<br>
	combustion engine, and comprising:<br>
10		- an annular shell of main axis D formed in a<br>
	first conducting material and having first and second<br>
	ends and an end circular surface with a main axis of<br>
	symmetry D located at the first end of the shell;<br>
		- a central electrode formed in a second<br>
15	conducting material extending along the main axis D and<br>
	comprising an internal portion positioned inside said<br>
	annular shell and an external portion positioned on the<br>
	outside of said annular shell, nearer to the first end<br>
	of the shell than to the second;<br>
20		- an electrically insulating component of annular<br>
	shape extending at least around the internal portion of<br>
	the central electrode such as to be inserted between<br>
	the shell and the electrode, this insulating component<br>
	covering only part of the external portion of the<br>
25	central electrode such that the uncovered part of the<br>
	external portion is in contact with a gaseous mixture<br>
	surrounding the spark plug.<br>
	Ignition in gasoline internal combustion engines, which<br>
30	 consists in initiating combustion of an air-fuel<br>
	mixture in a combustion chamber of said engine, is<br>
	relatively well controlled in current engines.<br>
	However, in order to comply with emissions standards,<br>
35	motor manufacturers have developed controlled-ignition<br>
	engines capable of running on lean air-fuel mixtures,<br>
	that is to say mixtures which contain an excess of air<br>
	with respect to the amount of fuel injected.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
	Igniting a fuel-lean mixture is, however, difficult to<br>
	control. As a result, and in order to improve the<br>
	probability of successful ignition, it is necessary to<br>
5	have more fuel-rich mixtures around the spark plug at<br>
	the instant the spark is produced.<br>
	Still with a view to increasing the probability that<br>
	the spark plug will ignite the mixture, novel spark<br>
10	plugs with surface sparks have been developed in order<br>
	to produce larger sparks to cope with the problem of<br>
	the spatio-temporal meeting between the fuel mixture<br>
	and the spark. Thus, a larger volume of mixture is<br>
	ignited, and the probability of initiating combustion<br>
15	is therefore very greatly improved.<br>
	Such spark plugs are described in particular in patent<br>
	applications FR97-14799, FR99-09473 and FR00-13821.<br>
	Such spark plugs generate large-sized sparks from small<br>
20	potential differences.<br>
	Surface spark spark plugs have a dielectric (insulating<br>
	component) separating the electrodes (one electrode<br>
	being the annular shell and the other electrode being<br>
25	the central electrode) in the region where the distance<br>
	between them is the smallest; the sparks formed between<br>
	the electrodes are thus guided onto the surface of the<br>
	dielectric. These spark plugs magnify the inter-<br>
	electrode field at the surface of the dielectric. In<br>
30	order to do that, the elementary capacitors formed by<br>
	the dielectric and an underlying electrode are<br>
	progressively charged. The spark plugs generate a spark<br>
	which travels along the surface of the insulator in the<br>
	regions where the electric field in the air/gaseous<br>
35	mixture is the strongest.<br>
	In this context, one object of the present invention is<br>
	therefore to provide a spark plug which, once assembled<br>
	in a combustion chamber, is able to increase the<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	probability of the mixture surrounding the spark plug<br>
	being ignited.<br>
	To this end, the spark plug of the invention, in other<br>
5	 respects in accordance with the generic definition<br>
	given in the aforementioned preamble, is essentially<br>
	characterized in that the insulating component has an<br>
	annular shoulder masking the entire end circular<br>
	surface of the shell with respect to the uncovered part<br>
10	 of the electrode.<br>
	With such a spark plug:<br>
		- on the one hand, the distance separating the<br>
	shell of the spark plug from the central electrode<br>
15	 (along a path passing along the surface of the<br>
	insulating component) is particularly long because it<br>
	exceeds the minimum dimension of the end circular<br>
	surface (that is to say the diameter of this circular<br>
	surface);<br>
20		- and, on the other hand, the central electrode<br>
	and the shell are separated by the insulating component<br>
	and therefore do not face one another.<br>
	These two reasons mean that when power is applied to<br>
25	the electrode and the shell in order to create a large<br>
	electric potential difference (generally varying from<br>
	5kV to 35 kv in terms of absolute peak values) between<br>
	them, there can be no electric arcing between the end<br>
	circular surface of the spark plug and the central<br>
30	electrode.<br>
	More generally, when the spark plug according to the<br>
	invention is assembled in a vehicle combustion engine,<br>
	with the part of the central electrode that is not<br>
35	covered with insulation positioned inside the chamber<br>
	and with the shell assembled into the thickness of the<br>
	wall of the chamber, there can be no electric arcing<br>
	between the shell and the central electrode. Indeed,<br>
	access to the shell from the uncovered part of the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	central electrode is prevented by the presence of the<br>
	insulation.<br>
	Under such conditions, the spark plug according to the<br>
5	 invention, when energized at a radiofrequency, that is<br>
	to say when an AC voltage is applied between the shell<br>
	and the central electrode (said AC voltage for example<br>
	being greater than 5 kV and having a frequency in<br>
	excess of 1 MHz) forms a branched plasma near the<br>
10	 central electrode rather than an electric arc. It must<br>
	be clearly understood that this voltage and given<br>
	frequency are suited to the creation of a plasma in a<br>
	gaseous mixture having a molar density in excess of<br>
	5x 10-2 mol/1.<br>
15<br>
	The term plasma or branched plasma used hereinafter<br>
	denotes the simultaneous generation of at least several<br>
	ionizing lines or paths in a given gaseous volume,<br>
	their branching furthermore being omnidirectional.<br>
20<br>
	Whereas a volume plasma implies heating up the entire<br>
	volume in which it is to be generated, a branched<br>
	plasma requires heating only along the path of the<br>
	sparks formed. Thus, for a given volume, the energy<br>
25	required for a branched plasma is markedly lower than<br>
	the energy required by a volume plasma.<br>
	The branched plasma generated by the spark plug<br>
	according to the invention is generated some distance<br>
30	from the insulating component, toward the walls of the<br>
	chamber which face the central electrode, thus making<br>
	it possible to reduce the probability of arcing with<br>
	the shell and correspondingly allowing electrode wear<br>
	to be reduced.<br>
35<br>
	By comparison with an electric arc, a plasma has the<br>
	advantage of comprising a great many ionizing or<br>
	sparking paths in a significant volume of gas situated<br>
	around the central electrode, thus increasing the<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
	probability that the mixture containing the oxidizing<br>
	agent will be ignited.<br>
	One difference between an electric arc and a branched<br>
5	plasma is that:<br>
		- the arc consists of a single sequence of<br>
	ionized gas molecules stretching directly between the<br>
	electrodes and allows electrons to be transferred from<br>
	one electrode to the other in order to reduce the<br>
10	 electric potential difference there is between these<br>
	powered electrodes, whereas:<br>
		- the plasma produced according to the invention<br>
	is a collection of numerous chains of ionized gas<br>
	molecules stretching in a disordered fashion around the<br>
15	energizing electrode and emanating from said electrode.<br>
	These multiple chains allow electrons to be sequences<br>
	transferred back and forth between said electrode and<br>
	the nearby air.<br>
20	The formation of a spark is initiated by plucking from<br>
	the medium (the gaseous mixture) a few electrons which<br>
	are subjected to a strong electric field. When a high<br>
	voltage is applied between the electrodes, electrons<br>
	from one electrode are accelerated by the electrostatic<br>
25	forces generated between the electrodes and bombard the<br>
	air-containing gaseous mixture. The portion of the<br>
	electrode that experiences the strongest electrostatic<br>
	field (generally a corner of an electrode or a spiked<br>
	point close to the other electrode) is the starting<br>
30	point for the first avalanche. The air molecules are<br>
	heated and release an electron and a photon which, in<br>
	their turn, ionize further air molecules. Thus, a chain<br>
	reaction ionizes the air when a high voltage is applied<br>
	between electrodes which are separated by an insulator.<br>
35<br>
	The ionized air around the central electrode has a<br>
	potential close to that of this central electrode and<br>
	behaves like a continuation thereof. As the avalanche<br>
	front (the name given to a massive wave of migration of<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
	electric charges in the gaseous mixture) spreads, the<br>
	electric field is amplified upstream of the front and<br>
	encourages the creation of further avalanches. Thus,<br>
	the phenomenon has a tendency to be self-sustaining,<br>
5	 creating around the central electrode a conducting<br>
	ionized gaseous mass moving toward the walls of the<br>
	chamber.<br>
	As specified earlier, the spark plug of the invention<br>
10	 has an AC voltage applied to it, thus making it<br>
	possible to vary the potential difference between the<br>
	central electrode and the shell/chamber, it being<br>
	possible for this potential difference to be reversed.<br>
	On each change of potential/polarity, the electrons are<br>
15	 increasingly accelerated in opposite directions. A<br>
	polarization wave thus travels, oscillating at the<br>
	energizing frequency, in each period recovering the<br>
	charges shed in the previous period. Each alternation<br>
	therefore causes the wave to spread to a greater extent<br>
20	 than the previous one; it is thus possible with the<br>
	spark plug of the invention powered in this way to<br>
	obtain relatively large sizes of sparks with relatively<br>
	high voltages applied between the electrode and the<br>
	shell. Energizing such a spark plug at a radio<br>
25	frequency additionally makes it possible to avoid<br>
	arcing and eliminate the variations in flash-over<br>
	voltage between successive cycles.<br>
	It is, for example, possible to contrive for the end<br>
30	circular surface of the shell to bear against a<br>
	complementary bearing surface of the shoulder of the<br>
	insulating component. This feature makes it possible to<br>
	eliminate the space between the insulating component<br>
	and the shell, and so the heat associated with the<br>
35	presence of a flame initiated by the plasma can be<br>
	dissipated to the shell, thus avoiding overheating the<br>
	ceramic.<br>
	It is also possible to contrive for the insulating<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	component to have a minimum thickness situated on the<br>
	inside of said shell, and the shoulder of the<br>
	insulating component to have a shoulder thickness<br>
	greater than or equal to half said minimum thickness.<br>
5<br>
	This feature makes it possible to avoid the join<br>
	between the uncovered part of the central electrode,<br>
	and therefore the air/ceramic/central electrode join<br>
	lying too close to the shell. If this uncovered part of<br>
10	the electrode or, more specifically this join, did lie<br>
	too close to the shell, it could constitute a region<br>
	where a surface spark could be emitted.<br>
	It is also possible to contrive for the shell, the<br>
15	electrically insulating component and the central<br>
	electrode to be components exhibiting symmetry of<br>
	revolution, their common axis of symmetry being the<br>
	main axis D.<br>
20	The precision on the relative placement of the<br>
	constituent parts of the spark plug with respect to a<br>
	common axis of symmetry allows the branched plasma to<br>
	be centered about this axis D and about the central<br>
	electrode, thus making it easier to localize the region<br>
25	where the sparks are produced within the combustion<br>
	chamber.<br>
	It is also possible to contrive for the annular shell<br>
	to have the shape of a cylindrical tube comprising, at<br>
30	the first end of the shell, an internal chamfer that<br>
	comes into contact with the end circular surface, this<br>
	internal chamfer being in contact with a complementary<br>
	chamfer formed on a portion of the insulating<br>
	component.<br>
35<br>
	This assembling of the insulating component against the<br>
	shell using complementary chamfers allows a better<br>
	distribution of the mechanical stresses there are<br>
	between the shell and the insulating component thus<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
	reducing, or even completely eliminating any sharp<br>
	corners of the shell in contact with the insulating<br>
	component. Excessive or poorly distributed mechanical<br>
	stresses could lead to breakage of the ceramic and<br>
5	damage to the spark plug. Thus, this feature of<br>
	mutually complementing chamfers allows the life of the<br>
	spark plug and its ability to withstand high<br>
	temperatures and temperature variations to be improved.<br>
10	This embodiment also makes it possible to increase the<br>
	area of contact between the insulating component and<br>
	the shell, thus assisting with heat transfer from the<br>
	insulating component to the shell and preventing this<br>
	insulating component from becoming overheated.<br>
15<br>
	Optimally, in order to distribute the mechanical<br>
	stresses between the insulating component and the<br>
	shell, the internal chamfer has a cross section, on a<br>
	plain parallel to the main axis D, that is of rounded<br>
20	shape.<br>
	It is also possible to contrive for the annular<br>
	shoulder to comprise an end distant from the annular<br>
	shell and at the exterior periphery of which there is<br>
25	formed a rounded peripheral chamfer coaxial with the<br>
	main axis D.<br>
	This peripheral chamfer reduces or eliminates the<br>
	presence of a sharp corner near the exterior periphery<br>
	3 0 of the annular component at the end of the annular<br>
	shoulder.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will<br>
	emerge clearly from the description thereof given<br>
	35 hereinafter by way of entirely nonlimiting indication<br>
	with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 depicts a spark plug described in French<br>
	patent applications FR03-10766, FR03-10767 and<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
	FR03-10768, filed by the Applicant Company and not yet<br>
	published;<br>
	figures 2a, 2b and 2c depict embodiments of the spark<br>
5	plug according to the invention.<br>
	The spark plug 1 of figure 1 is a spark plug developed<br>
	by the Applicant Company to be used as a plasma-<br>
	generating spark plug. This spark plug is covered by<br>
10	patent applications which at the date of filing of the<br>
	current application had not yet been published.<br>
	This spark plug comprises a cylindrical central<br>
	electrode 7 of axis of symmetry D of which a portion,<br>
15	termed the internal portion, is positioned inside and<br>
	some distance from an annular shell 3 which has the<br>
	form of a cylindrical tube of axis D.<br>
	An insulating component of annular shape is also<br>
20	positioned partly inside the annular shell, around the<br>
	central electrode, so as to separate the shell from the<br>
	central electrode 7. The insulating component, the<br>
	central electrode and the shell 3 are components which<br>
	exhibit symmetry of revolution about the axis D. The<br>
25	central electrode 7 has an uncovered part 16, that is<br>
	to say a part not surrounded by the electrically<br>
	insulating component 10 and not surrounded by the shell<br>
	3, this uncovered part 16 being positioned inside the<br>
	combustion chamber 2 of the engine.<br>
30<br>
	The shell 3 has an external circular surface in the<br>
	form of a flat disk perforated at its center and<br>
	having, as its axis of symmetry, the axis D, being<br>
	positioned perpendicular to this axis D. The shell 3<br>
35	has a connection with the wall of the chamber 2, this<br>
	generally involving screwing the shell into a hole made<br>
	through the wall. The shell of the spark plug thus<br>
	assembled with the wall of the chamber 2 is therefore<br>
	at equipotential with respect to this wall, that is to<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	say, is electrically grounded.<br>
	When the central electrode has applied to it an AC<br>
	voltage centered about the ground potential, this<br>
5	voltage having a frequency ranging between 1 and<br>
	10MHz, the electrons situated near the spiked point 17<br>
	of the central electrode travel either from the<br>
	electrode toward the walls of the chamber, through the<br>
	gaseous mixture surrounding the chamber, or from the<br>
10	gaseous mixture toward the electrode. In both<br>
	instances, the electrical alternation is such that an<br>
	electron does not have time to pass from the central<br>
	electrode to the wall of the chamber. The air can thus<br>
	be ionized without there being any true electric<br>
15	discharge between the two electrical terminals formed<br>
	by the central electrode 7 and by the wall of the<br>
	chamber 2. This ionization creates a localized plasma<br>
	around the spiked point 17 of the central electrode and<br>
	this concentrates the moving electric charges around a<br>
20	small exchange volume.<br>
	However, it has been found that, with this type of<br>
	electrode, electrical discharges between the spiked<br>
	point and the shell may arise in the frequency range<br>
25	between 1 MHz and 10 MHz. These discharges leave the<br>
	annular shell and spread along the insulating component<br>
	along the axis of the central electrode. This method of<br>
	obtaining a spark is undesirable because it keeps the<br>
	spark close to the insulating component and thus<br>
30	encourages cooling of the flame thus created.<br>
	The spark plugs of the types set out in figures 2A, 2B<br>
	and 2C have been developed in order to alleviate this<br>
	disadvantage.<br>
35<br>
	The spark plugs in those figures have all the features<br>
	described in respect of the spark plug referred to in<br>
	figure 1 but also have a shoulder 11 made on the<br>
	insulating component 10 and masking the external<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
	circular surface 6 of the shell 3.<br>
	This shoulder 11 increases the distance, traveling<br>
	through the gaseous mixture, between the electrode and<br>
5	the shell, thus making it possible to prevent arcing<br>
	between the central electrode 17 and the shell 3.<br>
	By virtue of this configuration, the electrodes of<br>
	figures 2A, 2B and 2C once positioned with the spiked<br>
10	point inside the chamber 2 and powered with AC current<br>
	by a high voltage AC generator, create a plasma at<br>
	their spiked points 17.<br>
	The minimum thickness "e" of the insulating component<br>
15	lies inside the shell 3 and its maximum thickness "E"<br>
	lies in the region of the shoulder 11.<br>
	The shoulder of the insulating component 10 of figure<br>
	2A is a shoulder which in longitudinal section exhibits<br>
20	right angles that may introduce concentrations of load<br>
	and mechanical stress.<br>
	For that reason, the spark plugs in figures 2B and 2C<br>
	have an internal chamfer 13 at the first end 4 of the<br>
25	 shell 3.<br>
	The insulating component 10 has a complementary chamfer<br>
	14 that comes into contact with the internal chamfer<br>
	13. This large contact area allows the heat to be<br>
30	removed from the insulating component to the shell,<br>
	thus extending the average life of the spark plug.<br>
	Also, the spark plug according to the invention in<br>
	figure 2C has a rounded peripheral chamfer 15 formed on<br>
35	the annular shoulder 11, at the point on the shoulder<br>
	that is axially furthest from the shell 3.<br>
	This shoulder makes it possible to avoid having a right<br>
	angle at the shoulder, in the path through the gaseous<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
	mixture between the spiked point 17 and the annular<br>
	shell 3. This rounded edge reduces the risk of arcing.<br>
	The first and second conducting materials which are the<br>
5	respective materials of the central electrode and of<br>
	the shell 3 are, according to one particular embodiment<br>
	of the invention, the same as one another. These<br>
	materials are metallic materials such as copper alloys.<br>
10	According to one particular embodiment of the<br>
	invention, the end of the central electrode 7 may<br>
	consist of a copper core surrounded by a nickel sleeve.<br>
	The insulating material is preferably a ceramic with a<br>
15	dielectric strength in excess of 20 kv/mm.<br><br>
