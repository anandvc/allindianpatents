				<td>Mirror<br>
This invention relates to mirrors and to a process of manufacturing mirrors.<br>
The mirrors of this invention may have various applications, for example: domestic mirrors used for example in furniture, wardrobes or bathrooms; mirrors in make-up boxes or kits; mirrors used in the automotive industry, as rear-view mirrors for cars, for example. Such mirrors may be produced by applying a silver coating on glass sheets, particularly on soda hme glass, flat glass or float glass.<br>
Conventionally, silver mirrors have been produced as follows: the glass was first of aU polished and then sensitised, typically using an aqueous solution of SnCli; after rinsing, the surface of the glass was usually activated by means of an ammoniacal silver nitrate treatment, and a silvering solution was then applied in order to form an opaque coating of silver; this silver coating was then covered with a protective layer of copper and then with one or more coats of leaded paint in order to produce the firushed mirror. The combination of the protective copper layer and the leaded paint was deemed necessary to provide acceptable ageing characteristics and sufficient corrosion resistance.<br>
More recently, Glaverbel developed mirrors which dispensed with the need for the conventional copper layer, which could use substantially lead-free paints and yet which still had acceptable or even improved ageing characteristics and corrosion resistance. US patent number 6,565,217 describes, for example, a mirror with no copper layer which comprises in the order recited: a vitreous substrate; both tin and palladium provided at a surface of the vitreous substrate; a silver coating layer on said surface of the substrate; tin present at the<br>
surface of the silver coating layer which is adjacent to a paint layer; and two paint layers covering the silver coating layer. Such mirrors provided a significant advance with respect to conventional coppered mirrors.<br>
Such mirrors with no copper layer generally comprise a silver coating layer of around 80 nm to 90 nm thick. It would be advantageous from a cost perspective to reduce the thickness of the silver coating. However, it has been found that reducing the thickness of the silver layer can aggravate or provoke an optical defect: the presence of a mottled colour visible to the naked eye perceivable at the bottom of the silver layer, particularly when looking at the silver layer of the mirror through the glass at a small angle (between about 5°-15°) with respect to the glass surface.<br>
According to one of its aspects, the present invention provides a mirror with no copper layer as defined by claim 1. Other claims define preferred and/or alternative aspects of the invention.<br>
The inventors suspect that one factor affecting the defect perceived as a mottled colour may be the homogeneity of the thickness of the silver coating. Inhomogeneities in the silver coating layer may be unintentionally introduced by the spraying process used to deposit the silver layer and/or by other process parameters. Such inhomogeneities may create zones within the silver coating at which the local thickness of the silver coating is so thin so as to allow the paint to be partially visible through the silver. Indeed, when the thickness of the silver coating layer is decreased in a mirror with no copper layer as described above which usually uses a red paint adjacent to the silver coating layer, the defect may be perceived as red clouds visible to naked eye in the bottom of the silver, particularly when looking at a small angle. Such a defect is sometimes called a "sky". The inventors suspect that the way this type of defect is seen may be<br>
linked to the difference in the local luminous reflection at relatively thicker and thinner portions of the silver coating.<br>
In one of its aspects, the invention preferably reduces the occurrence of this type of defect being perceived. In another aspect, the invention allows for the use of thinner silver coatings without this defect becoming debilitating.<br>
The invention provides a mirror which can be manufactured at lower cost and which may comprise less silver than already known mirrors, whereas keeping a good reflectance and being aesthetically as acceptable as previous known mirrors. In addition, mirrors according to the invention may offer at least an equal resistance to ageing and/or corrosion than conventional mirrors with a copper layer or already known mirrors without a copper layer.<br>
Mirrors according to the invention comprise a paint layer covering the silver coating layer and adjacent to it, whose colour is characterised by L* lower than 40; preferably L* may be lower than 39, lower than 38, or lower than 37, and more preferably lower than 36, lower than 35, or lower than 32. It has been found that using a colour which absorbs light, or at least which does not reflect too much light, for the paint immediately behind the silver may avoid seeing a coloured sky in the silver coating layer when looking at the mirror from the glass side.<br>
Advantageously, the colour of the paint layer adjacent to the silver coating layer may match or at least be close to the colour of the bottom of the silver coating, i.e. black. This may avoid seeing inhomogeneities in the sliver. Preferably, a* of the paint layer adjacent to the silver coating layer may be in the range -10 to +10, -8 to +8, more preferably -6 to +6, -5 to +5, -4 to +4, and still more preferably -3 to +3, -2 to +2. Preferably, b* of the paint layer adjacent to the<br>
silver coating layer may be in the range -10 to +10, -8 to +8, more preferably -6 to +6, -5 to +5, -4 to +4, and still more preferably -3 to +3, -2 to +2.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the colour of the mirror seen from the glass side may be characterised by the fact that there exists no point of the reflective silver coating of the mirror which has a difference in colour AE with any other point of the reflective silver coating of the mirror, measured at an angle of 90°, of more than 1.6, preferably more than 1.7, more than 1.8, more preferably more than 1.9, more than 2.0, more than 2.1, more than 2.2.<br>
L*, a*, b* are colour coordinates defined in the CIELAB 1976 space. AE     represents     the     difference     in     colour     between     two     points:<br>
Preferably, the silver coating layer has a thickness of less than 80 nm, or less than 75 nm, more preferably less than 70 nm, less than 67 nm, less than 65 nm, less than 63 nm or less than 60 nm, and preferably not less than 55 nm. Such thicknesses allow to obtain an acceptable luminous reflectance for the mirror and good aesthetics, without visible sky, whilst reducing the production cost. The silver coating layer may advantageously comprise less than 700 mg of silver per m2 of glass, less than 670 mg/m2, less than 650 mg/m2, less than 630 mg/m2, or less than 600 mg/m2, and preferably not less than 550 mg/m2. The thickness or quantity of silver may be known by analysing a 3.7 cm x 3.7 cm mirror sample by fluorescence-X or by titiating a silver solution coming from the acid attack of the silver coating layer of a 10 cm x 10 cm mirror sample.<br>
The minimum thickness of silver acceptable without the final product showing a "sky", or before this defect becomes debilitating, depends of course on the colour of the paint adjacent to the silver coating layer, in particular<br>
its L*, but also on various process parameters hke, for example, the silvering<br>
solution composition, the silvering solution provider, the physicochemical properties of the glass before silvering, or the spraying system. Generally speaking, the silver coating layer may advantageously show, at any 3.7 cm x 3.7 cm region of its whole surface, not less than a quantity of 640 mg of silver per m2 of glass, averaged over said region.<br>
Preferably, the finished mirrors according to this invention may have a luminous reflectance of at least 80%, at least 82%, more preferably at least 83%, at least 85%, at least 88%, and still more preferably at least 90% measured through the glass substiate. The luminous reflection may be less than 98%, less than 96% or less than 95%.<br>
Advantageously, one or more material may be deposited during an activating step on a surface of the glass substrate on which the silver layer is to be deposited; this may contribute to the corrosion resistance of the mirror. Such material may be palladium, for example. Tin may be provided at or on a surface of the glass substrate on which the silver layer is to be deposited; this may sensitise the glass substrate and may facilitate adhesion of the silver layer thereto. The glass substrate may be sensitised prior to being activated, activated prior to being sensitised or sensitised and activated simultaneously. Preferably, one or more material may be deposited during a passivating step on the surface of the silver coating layer on which the paint layer is to be deposited; this may contribute to the corrosion resistance of the mirror. Such material may be tin or palladium, for example.<br>
Materials provided at the surface of the glass substrate during an activating and/or sensitising step and/or at the surface of the silver layer during a passivating step are preferably provided as islets, that is to say that preferably<br>
they do not produce a distinct continuous layer of, for example, palladium, but that the material is in the form of islets on the surface of the glass.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the paint layer or at least one of the paint layers appHed over the silver layer is lead-free or substantially lead-free. Conventionally, silver coating layers of mirrors were protected by an overcoat of copper. The copper layer was itself protected from abrasion and corrosion by a layer of paint. The paint formulations which afforded acceptable levels of protection against ageing and/or corrosion contained lead pigments. The proportion of lead in such a leaded paint layer could be around 13000 mg/m2. The mirrors according to the present invention not only dispense with the need for a copper layer but they also allow the use of paints which are substantially lead-free. This is advantageous in that lead is toxic and its avoidance has environmental benefits. Substantially lead-free means herein that the proportion of lead in the paint is significantly less than the proportion of lead in leaded paints conventionally used for mirrors. The proportion of lead in a substantially lead-free paint layer as herein defined is less than 500 mg/m2, preferably less than 400 mg/m2, more preferably less than 300 mg/m2. The proportion of lead in a lead-free paint layer as herein defined is less than 100 mg/m2, preferably less than 80 mg/m2, more preferably less than 60 mg/m2. Paints used herein may be acryhc, epoxy, alkyd, etc.<br>
Traces of silane may be present at the surface of the silver coating layer which is provided adjacent to the at least one paint layer covering the silver coating layer. The treatment of the silver coating layer with a silane before painting may enhance and/or contribute towards the resistance of the mirror to abrasion and/or corrosion.<br>
Mirrors according to the invention preferably have good ageing and corrosion resistance, preferably at least comparable to the ageing and corrosion resistance of mirrors of the type described in US patent number 6,565,217.<br>
One indication of the corrosion resistance and/or resistance to ageing of a mirror incorporating a silver film can be given by subjecting it to a copper-accelerated acetic acid salt spray test known as the CASS test in which the mirror is placed in a testing chamber at 50°C and is subjected to the action of a fog formed by spraying an aqueous solution containing 50 g/1 sodium chloride, 0.26 g/1 anhydrous cuprous chloride with sufficient glacial acetic acid to bring the pH of the sprayed solution to between 3.1 and 3.3. Full details of this test are set out in International Standard ISO 9227-1990. Mirrors may be subjected to the action of the saline fog for different lengths of time, whereafter the reflective properties of the artificially aged mirror may be compared with the reflective properties of the freshly formed mirror. An exposure time of 120 hours gives a useful indication of the resistance of a mirror to ageing. The CASS test is performed on 10 cm square mirror tiles having freshly cut edges, and after exposure to the copper-accelerated acetic acid salt spray for 120 and 240 hours, each tile is subjected to microscopic examination. The principal visible evidence of corrosion is a darkening of the silver layer and peeling of the paint around the margins of the mirror. The extent of corrosion is noted at five regularly spaced sites on each of two opposed edges of the tile and the mean average of these ten measurements is calculated. One can also measure the maximum corrosion present at the margin of the tile to obtain a result which is again measured in micrometers; preferably, the maximum corrosion is less than 300 µm, more preferably less than 250 µm or less than 200 µm. For a more representative evaluation, the CASS test may be performed on ten samples of a mirror and the<br>
mean average of the ten samples calculated from the mean average of each sample.<br>
Another evidence of corrosion of mirrors is the apparition of white specks, visible by the naked eye or under an optical microscope, after the CASS test. These white specks are already defined in US 6,565,217. Preferably, mirrors according to the present invention have less than ten white specks per dm2 following the CASS test, more preferably, less than five white specks per dm2, or less than one white speck per dm2.<br>
In methods of manufacturing mirrors according to certain aspects of the invention, the sensitising, activating and passivating steps may contribute to the ageing and/or corrosion resistance of the mirrors and/or to their durability. Preferably the sensitising step is carried out prior to the activating step and the activating step before silvering. Preferably, the solutioris brought into contact with the glass substiate during the successive manufacturing steps are sprayed onto the glass substrate with optional intervening rinsing and/or washing steps.<br>
For example, during the industiial manufacture of flat mirrors, sheets of glass may pass through successive stations where sensitisation, activation, silvering and passivating reagents are sprayed. In practice, on a mirror production line, the sheets of glass are generally conveyed along a path by a roller conveyor. They are first of all polished and rinsed prior to being sensitised by means for example of a tin chloride solution sprayed on the glass; they are then rinsed again. An activating solution is then sprayed onto the sheets of glass, this activating solution may be for example, an acidic aqueous solution of PdCh. The sheets of glass then pass to a rinsing station where demineraUsed water is sprayed, and then to the silvering station where a traditional silvering solution is sprayed, the silvering solution being combined upon application to the glass<br>
from two separately sprayed solutions, one solution comprising a silver salt and either a reducing agent or a base and the other solution comprising whichever component (a reducing agent or a base) which is absent from the solution containing the silver salt. The flow rate and concentration of the silvering solution sprayed onto the glass are controlled so as to form a layer of silver of a desired thickness, for example containing between 600 and 800 mg/m^ of silver, preferably in the range 650-750 mg/m^ of silver. The glass is then rinsed and directly after the rinsing of the silver coating, an aqueous solution of for example stannous chloride is sprayed onto the silvered glass sheets as they move forward along the conveyor. After a further rinsing, the mirrors may then be treated by spraying with a solution containing a silane. After rinsing and drying, the mirrors are covered with one or more paint layers. The paint is then cured or dried, for example in a turmel oven. Preferably, the paint is applied onto the silvered substrates in the form of a continuous curtain of liquid paint falling onto the glass sheets in a curtain coating process. The paint layer adjacent to the silver coating layer is adapted to provide, once dried, a colour characterised by L* being less than 40.<br>
The thickness of the glass substrate may be greater than 1 mm, 2 mm or 2.5 mm; it may be less than 10 mm, 8 mm or 6 mm. The thickness of the glass substrate may be within the range of 1.8 mm to 8.2 mm.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be further described, by way of examples only, along with a comparative example.<br>
Example 1<br>
A mirror according to the invention is manufactured on a conventional mirror production line in which a flat sheet of clear soda lime float glass is conveyed along the line by a roller conveyor.<br>
The sheet of glass is first of all polished, rinsed and then sensitised by means of a tin chloride solution, in the usual manner; it is then rinsed again. An acidic aqueous solution of PdCb is then sprayed onto the sheet of glass following the teaching of US patent number 6,565,217. The sheet of glass then passes to a rinsing station where demineralised water is sprayed, and then to the silvering station where a traditional silvering solution is sprayed to form a layer containing approximately 720 mg/m2 of silver in example la (i.e. around 10% less than for standard mirrors) and 640 mg/m2 of silver in example lb (i.e. around 20% less than for standard mirrors). The glass is then rinsed by spraying with water, and directly after the rinsing of the silver coating, a freshly formed acidified solution of tin chloride is sprayed onto the silvered glass sheets. The mirrors are then tieated by spraying with a solution containing 0.1% by volume of □-aminopropyl tiiethoxysHane (Silane A1100 from Union Carbide).<br>
After rinsing and drying, the mirrors are curtain coated with a single layer of black paint with a thickness of around 50 µm.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 2 is manufactured as described above in example 1 (but on another production line, and with a silvering solution coming from another provider), except that the silver layer contains approximately 700 mg/m2 of silver in example 2a and 650 mg/m2 of silver in example 2b and that two paint layers are deposited on the mirrors: a first one, adjacent to the silver coating is dark grey, and the second is green, each paint layer being around 25 µm. thick.<br>
Comparative example<br>
A comparative example not in accordance with the invention is manufactured as described above in example 1, except that two paint layers are deposited on the mirrors: a first one, adjacent to the silver coating is red, and the<br>
second is green, each paint layer being around 25 µm thick. The comparative example corresponds to a copperless mirror as previously known.<br>
Mirrors manufactured in this manner are subjected to AE measurements; maximum values of AE between two points of identical mirrors are given below, in table I. Luminous reflectance (RL) of the mirrors are also shown.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 3 is manufactured as described above in example 1, except that the silver layer contains approximately 650 mg/m2 of silver in example 3b and that a different paint is used.<br>
Mirrors manufactured in this marmer are subjected to AE measurements; maximum values of AE between two points of identical mirrors are giveii below, in table II.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3 shows that for this particular configuration (production line, silvering solution and paint):<br>
-	an average quantity of silver of around 90% of the normal quantity is greatly enough to obtain a mirror without defect, whilst<br>
-	an average quantity of silver of around 80% of the normal quantity is too low to obtain a mirror without xmacceptable defect.<br>
All CIELAB values and luminous reflectance given herein are measured under illumtnant D65 10°.<br>
