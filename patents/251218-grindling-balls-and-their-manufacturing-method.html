				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the grinding of mineral or organic substances, and in particular to spheroid fritted-ceramic balls used in agitator mills, of the attrition type or others, for the reduction, dispersion and regeneration of particles in a dry and/or wet process.<br>
State of the art and introduction<br>
The equipment and methods of fine grinding and the dispersion with dry and wet processes are well known to those skilled in the art and developed in industries such as:<br>
-	the mineral industry with the fine grinding of pre-ground<br>
particles by means of traditional methods,<br>
-	the  industries  of  paint,  ink,  lacquer  and  agrochemical<br>
compounds as well as for the dispersion and homogenisation of<br>
liquids and of varied solid constituents.<br>
In most cases, these equipment and methods use dispersion or grinding materials of an essentially spherical shape and of reduced diameters (generally less than 10mm).<br>
Fine and ultra-fine grinding has recently become an essential development path in the mining industries, with the need to supply economical grinding materials.<br>
The agitator mill can be described as follows: it comprises a cylindrical chamber positioned horizontally or vertically and containing small balls with a diameter of 0.5mm to 12mm depending on the desired fineness for the finished product. An axis with discs rotates in this chamber. These discs transmit the motion to the grinding medium and to the material to be ground. The motion of the whole assembly allows<br><br>
the dispersion of the material to be ground between the grinding balls that have the function of reducing said material to a predetermined fineness. The particle size obtained is thus a function of the energy put into the machine.<br>
This grinding method can be achieved continuously in wet and dry processes, with the supply and discharge of the material to be ground, or in batches, i.e. in an entirely closed cylindrical chamber.<br>
The grinding media themselves are clearly subjected to wear and their selection will depend on the following criteria:<br>
-	chemical  inertness  relative  to  the  ground  or  dispersed<br>
products,<br>
-	resistance to mechanical impacts,<br>
-	resistance to wear,<br>
-	wear caused on the internal equipment of the mill or of the<br>
disperser,<br>
-	its  density,  a  higher  density  giving  good  grinding<br>
performance,<br>
-	the absence of open porosity, leading to rapid wear of the<br>
grinding balls,<br>
-	an acceptable spherical shape.<br>
A limited number of media used in agitator mills or in dispersers can be found on the market:<br>
-	sand with rounded grains (quartz, zircon),<br>
-	glass balls,<br>
-	metal balls,<br>
-	fused-ceramic balls (electro-fused),<br>
-	fritted-ceramic balls.<br>
Sand with rounded grains is a natural and cheap product. Its poor resistance to mechanical impacts, its low density, its variations in quality (inconsistency of deposits), its abrasiveness towards the internal equipment of<br><br>
agitation mills and dispersers constitute its limitations in application.<br>
Glass balls that are widely used to overcome the drawbacks of sand with rounded grains turn out to be less effective in grinding or dispersion applications that require balls with high mechanical resistance and high wear resistance. Their low density of 2.5g/cm3 is also a feature that limits their use when grinding efficiency is an important element of the process.<br>
Metal balls turn out less effective for the following reasons:<br>
-	they are insufficiently chemically inert relative to the<br>
ground or dispersed products,<br>
-	their  excessively  high  density  entails  high  energy<br>
consumption and high heating level of the internal equipment<br>
of the mills/agitators.<br>
Ceramic balls on the other hand have better mechanical resistance than glass balls, a density that is intermediate between that of glass balls and that of metal balls as well as good chemical inertness relative to the ground or dispersed products.<br>
Depending on the manufacturing methods, ceramic balls are classified into two groups:<br>
-	fused-ceramic  balls,  obtained by  the  fusion  of  ceramic<br>
compounds  at  very  high  temperature  (+/-  2000°C)  and<br>
solidified in the form of droplets,<br>
-	fritted-ceramic  balls,  obtained  by  cold  shaping  of  the<br>
ceramic compounds and consolidation of the latter by fritting<br>
at high temperature (+/- 1500°C).<br>
Depending on the ceramic compounds shaped, the fritted-ceramic balls are classified into four groups: balls made of alumina (Al2O3 content &gt;_90%) , balls made of alumina silicate (mullite or others),<br><br>
balls made of alumina-zirconia (85 to 95% A1203 - 15 to 5%<br>
Zr02) ,<br>
balls made of zirconia, stabilised or partially stabilised<br>
by means  of  yttrium,  cerium or magnesium oxide,  among<br>
others.<br>
The compositions of mullite/zirconia as well as those of mullite/alumina/zirconia have generally been studied in the context of fireproof bricks to be used in glass furnaces.<br>
In their publication "High temperature mechanical properties of reaction-sintered mullite/zirconia and mullite/alumina/zirconia composites" (Journal of Materials Science 20 (1985), pp. 2533-2540), G. Orange and F. Gambler studied the break resistance of such compounds as well as their impact resistance at high temperature (1000°C) for using these compounds in structural applications such as glass furnaces.<br>
The problem with grinding balls is however very different. These balls must be much smoother than fireproof bricks in as much as the mere presence of angles on the grinding media may reduce by 50% the useful life of the internal equipment of attrition mills, leading to maintenance costs that make the use of very rough grinding media impossible.<br>
The surface finish of grinding balls is thus very important since it directly affects the internal wear of the equipment and the grinding quality. Said surface finish is also directly affected by the chemical composition and the manufacturing method of said balls.<br>
Grinding balls in electrically fused alumina and zirconia are disclosed in the American patents US 3,486,706 and US 5,502,012, respectively. These documents claim specific vitreous phases.<br><br>
Patent application EP-0 662 461 Al discloses balls of ceramic material formed by the fusion of a mixture of zirconia and silica and studies the effect of the presence of yttrium and cerium oxides.<br>
Document EP 1 167 320 Al describes low-cost products made of alumina-zirconia-silica, melted and cast into blocks, to be used in glass furnace regenerators or in superstructures.<br>
All grinding balls comprising silica, alumina or zirconia have the common feature that they have been produced by fusion, which requires access to temperatures above 2000°C, which is technically difficult and hence expensive. By contrast, none of these documents discloses grinding balls made of fritted ceramic, comprising at the same time silica, alumina and zirconia. This process can be achieved at about 1500°C, which is much easier in terms of technology and hence less expensive.<br>
Aims of the invention<br>
The present invention aims to provide grinding balls made of fritted ceramic with a particular composition having high durability and good resistance to cold wear, to be used in grinding mills for mineral or organic substances. In addition, it aims to provide a method for manufacturing such balls.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention relates to balls made of fritted ceramic comprising alumina-zirconia-alumina silicate, and in particular alumina-zirconia-mullite. The quality of these balls is higher than that of balls made of alumina, of alumina silicate or of alumina-zirconia, and their cost is significantly lower than that of zirconia balls, which are very expensive and used in particular as grinding and/or dispersion medium.<br>
More precisely, the invention relates to balls made of fritted ceramic with the following chemical composition, by weight %:<br>
-	5 to 40% Zr02 + Hf02, preferably between 9 and 25%,<br>
-	0.1 to 10% Y203, preferably between 0.5 and 3%,<br>
-	0.5 to 20% Si02, preferably between 5 and 12%,<br>
-	40 to 90% A1203 preferably between 60 and 85%,<br>
with a Zr02/Si02 ratio greater than or equal to 2, preferably equal to 2.<br><br>
- 0 to 5% of optional oxides (Na20, CaO, MgO, Bao, ...) .<br>
These balls may be formed by shaping from a slurry and/or a paste of ceramic oxides, dried and fritted at temperatures between 1400°C and 1700°C, preferably between 1500°C and 1600°C.<br>
In the following description, where Zr02 (zirconia) is mentioned, the total of (ZrO2 + Hf02) is to be taken into account. Indeed, some Hf02, that is chemically inseparable from Zr02 and has similar properties, is always present in addition to Zr02, which is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The  invention  is  based  on  the  dissociation reaction of zircon at high temperature in the presence of alumina. This reaction is also well known to those skilled in the art: (3+x) . A1203 + 2ZrSi04 (high TO) x . A1203 + 3A1203 . 2Si02 +2Zr02<br>
Varying x allows to adjust the relative volume proportions of alumina (A1203) (if x # 0) , of alumina silicate in general and of mullite (3A1203.2Si02) in particular and of zirconia (Zr02) , and thus to modify the properties of the final fritted ceramic composite such as hardness, durability and wear resistance.<br>
The reaction at high temperature between zircon and alumina allows to obtain, by fritting pulverulent powders, very homogeneous composites, the synthesised phases of which are finely dispersed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, yttrium oxide (Y203) is added to the basic reagent of the preceding reaction, which allows to stabilise the crystallographic forms (cubic or tetragonal) of zirconia obtained at high temperature.<br>
Zirconia remains mainly in tetragonal and sometimes in cubic shape in low proportions. These states depend on the amount of Y203 introduced. The tetragonal form is<br><br>
the densest of the three allotropic variants of zirconia: density of 6.1g/cc versus 5.9g/cc for zirconia in the cubic shape and 5.8g/cc for zirconia in the monoclinic shape.<br>
The tetragonal shape also gives a mechanical reinforcement effect to the matrix in which it is located. The total quantity of Y203, i.e. the portion entering the zirconia in order to stabilise it and the excess portion entering the composition of the silicate phase (mullite), leads to the production of denser balls with greater resistance to high impact forces and to wear.<br>
Stabilisation of the zirconia also allows to improve the durability of the composite and to increase the dissociation speed of zircon, hence to reduce the temperature or the duration of fritting. This reduction in the temperature or duration of fritting allows to obtain a finer microstructure which is a major advantage in terms of wear resistance.<br>
The dry ceramic ingredients of the balls of this invention are intimately mixed in a mixer, some water may possibly be added to the mixture, for example in order to obtain a pasty consistency or in order to form a slurry.<br>
The mixed constituents, particularly in a dry process, may be transformed in spheres by means of a rotating pelletising disc or of a granulation disc. The powder of the ceramic ingredients turns into spheres by fogging of water with one or several organic binding agents added, on the rotary bed of the solid components. Fogging is adjusted so that the balls coming out of the pelletising disc comprise between 18 and 22% by weight of water.<br>
Description of the method of the invention<br>
The pelletisation method for obtaining balls can be diagrammatically represented as follows:<br><br>
After the spheres are formed, they undergo a sieving process according to three grain size fractions:<br>
a)	the fraction with the desired grain size where the balls<br>
formed follow the manufacturing method through to the end;<br>
b)	the fraction with a grain size lower than that desired where<br>
the balls formed are returned to the pelletising disc in<br>
order to continue growing;<br>
c)	the fraction with a grain size greater than that desired<br>
where the balls formed are dried, pulverised and sent back<br>
to the mixer.<br>
The fraction with the desired grain size (a) is dried in a conventional drying oven at a temperature of about 110°C until the balls have a humidity level lower than 1% by weight.<br>
The dried balls are then loaded into a fritting oven. The balls are fritted at a temperature between 1400°C<br><br>
and 1600°C according to a well-defined heating speed programme.<br>
After fritting and cooling of the oven, the balls are conditioned in their packaging and are ready for dispatch.<br>
Granulation by a fluidised bed dryer is shown in the following diagram:<br>
(Table Removed)The ceramic ingredients that make up the balls of this invention with water and a dispersant added, are finely ground in a proportion of dry material within the range of 50 to 75%. After grinding, the extracted slurry receives organic binding agents (5 to 7%) and is finely mixed.<br><br>
The slurry is injected at room temperature through injectors into a granulation fluidised-bed dryer where it comes into contact with the fluidised solid particles (seeds) having the same composition as that of the invention.<br>
The hot air (140°C max.) entering the dryer evaporates the water contained in the slurry, thus causing the deposition of the dry materials on the seeds. The successive depositions of dry material make the granules grow in layers and transform them into balls. Once the balls reach the desired size, they are removed from the dryer.<br>
After extraction from the dryer, the balls undergo a sieving operation:<br>
a)	the balls with a smaller particle size than that desired go<br>
back into the dryer in order to continue their growth in it;<br>
b)	the balls with a larger particle size than that desired<br>
undergo a grinding operation and then go back into the dryer<br>
in order to serve as seeds for future balls;<br>
c)	the balls with the desired particle size follow the process<br>
(fritting at high temperature, packaging) to its end as in<br>
the process at Point A.<br>
Other manufacturing methods<br>
Shaping of the balls by gelation reaction:<br>
-	production of a slurry comprising between 50 and 75% dry<br>
materials, from the ceramic ingredients making up the balls<br>
of this invention with water and a dispersant added.<br>
-	addition to the slurry of a natural polysaccharide: 0.5 to 3%<br>
relative to the concentration of dry materials.<br>
-	gelation by flow,  drop by drop,  of the slurry through<br>
capillaries of different diameters in an aqueous solution<br>
comprising polyvalent cations.<br>
-	separation of the balls formed from the aqueous solution,<br>
washing of the balls in water, drying and fritting at high temperature.<br><br>
Shaping of the balls by the injection moulding process:<br>
-	production of a suspension from the ceramic ingredients<br>
making up the balls of this invention with binding agents<br>
(waxes,  polymers)  and  surfactants  (carboxylic  acid,  for example stearic acid, oleic acid, ...) added.<br>
-	heating of this suspension to ± 160°C and injection of same<br>
into the impressions of the balls made in a metal mould,<br>
previously heated between 40 and 60°C.<br>
-	after solidification of the balls formed, extraction of these<br>
from the mould, unbinding of the binding agents according to<br>
a well-defined thermal treatment and fritting of the balls at<br>
high temperature.<br>

1.3 Methodology and performance criteria<br>
The slurries are ground in a Netzsch-type attrition mill according to the grinding circuit described in Fig.2. For each sample of grinding materials, a slurry is ground until a<br><br>
similar particle size in obtained. During each grinding cycle, at regular interval (for example, every hour), slurry samples are taken from the circuit. The particle size analysis of these samples allows to follow the evolution of the size of the ground particles as a function of the grinding time and of the energy consumed by the attrition mill. These data allow to determine the equation of the curves of the enclosed figures 3 to 10 for each tested grinding material. The quantity of each sample of grinding material to be put in the attrition mill is precisely determined and weighted in order to occupy a constant volume of the grinding chamber. This initial weight (Win.) of each grinding load is recorded.<br>
At the end of each grinding cycle, the chamber of the attrition mill is emptied and the grinding load is again precisely weighted in order to determine the final weight<br>
(Wfin.) •<br>
For each sample of tested grinding materials, parameters integrated into the following equations are taken into consideration:<br>
-	the equation of the evolution curve of the slurry fineness<br>
according to the grinding time,<br>
-	the equation of the evolution curve of the slurry fineness<br>
according to the energy consumed by the attrition mill,<br>
-	the recordal of the initial weight (Win.) and of the final<br>
weight (Wfin.) of the balls in the attrition mill,<br>
-	the cost of raw materials.<br>
These equations will allow to compare  the  samples  tested relative to the balls of the invention as regards the wear resistance, grinding efficiency and savings for the user in the following way: a) Wear performance:<br>
- wear of the balls U (gr/kWh): U = (Win.-Wfin.) / Ce.<br><br>
The loss  in weight of the balls in the attrition mill divided by the energy consumed (Ce) by the attrition mill allows thus to quantify the actual wear for each sample of balls tested. Being  Ws: wear of the samples of grinding materials<br>
Wb: wear of the balls of the invention Wear performance = Ws/Wb<br>
A ratio of wear &gt;1 indicates that the sample considered wears more than the balls of the invention, b) Grinding efficiency<br>
-	time performance<br>
The equation of the evolution curve of the slurry fineness according to the grinding time allows to quantify the time required to obtain a determined slurry fineness (d50). D50 (urn) being the average particle diameter of the slurry. Being Ts: grinding time required for the sample tested to<br>
obtain d50 Tb:  grinding time required for the balls of the<br>
invention to obtain d50. Time performance = Ts/Tb<br>
A grinding time ratio &gt;1 indicates that the sample considered will monopolize the attrition mill more than the balls of the invention to do the same work.<br>
-	energy consumption performance<br>
The equation of the evolution curve of the slurry fineness according to the energy consumed by the attrition mill allows to quantify the energy consumed by the attrition mill to obtain a determined slurry fineness (d50). Being Es: energy required for the sample tested to obtain<br>
d50 Eb: energy required for the balls of the invention to<br>
obtain d50 Energy consumption performance = Es/Eb<br><br>
An energy ratio &gt;1 indicates that the sample considered consumes more energy than the balls of the invention to do the same work. - saving index (S)<br>
