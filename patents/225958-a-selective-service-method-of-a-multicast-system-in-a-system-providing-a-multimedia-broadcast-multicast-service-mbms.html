BROADCAST/MULTICAST SERVICE (MBMS)"<br>
TECHWCAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a multicast service of a 3GPP Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and, more particularly, to a<br>
selective service method in a multicast system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third<br>
generation mobile communication system that has evolved from a standard<br>
known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). This standard is a<br>
European standard which aims to provide an improved mobile communication<br>
service based on a GSM core network and wideband code division multiple<br>
access (W-CDMA) technology.<br>
In December, 1998, the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the T1<br>
of the United States, and the TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) for the purpose of creating the specification for<br>
standardizing the UMTS.<br>
The work toward standardizing the UMTS performed by the 3GPP has<br>
resulted in the formation of five technical specification groups (TSG), each of<br>
which is directed to forming network elements having independent operations.<br>
More specifically, each TSG develops, approves and manages a<br><br>
standard specification in a related region. Among them, a radio access network<br>
(RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops a specification for the function, items desired,<br>
and interface of a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a<br>
new RAN for supporting a W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an example of the construction of a general UMTS<br>
network.<br>
The UMTS is roughly divided into a terminal, a UTRAN and a core<br>
network.<br>
The UTRAN includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS).<br>
Each RNS includes an RNC and one or more Node Bs managed by the RNCs.<br>
Node Bs are-managed by the RNCs, receive information sent by the<br>
physical layer of a terminal (e.g., mobile station, user equipment and/or<br>
subscriber unit) through an uplink, and transmit data to a terminal through a<br>
downlink. Node Bs, thus, operate as access points of the UTRAN for terminal.<br>
The RNCs perform functions which include assigning and managing<br>
radio resources, and operate as an access point with respect to the core<br>
network.<br>
The UTRAN constructs and maintains a radio access bearer (RAB) for<br>
communication between the terminal and the core network. The core network<br>
requests end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements from the RAB, and<br>
the RAM supports the QoS requirements the core network has set. Accordingly,<br>
by constructing and maintaining the RAB, the UTRAN can satisfy the end-to-<br>
end QoS requirements.<br><br>
The services provided to the specific terminal is roughly divided into a<br>
circuit switched service and a packet switched service. For example, a general<br>
voice phone call service belongs to the circuit switched service, while a Web<br>
browsing service through an Internet connection is classified as the packet<br>
switched service.<br>
In case of supporting the circuit switched service, the RNC is connected<br>
to the MSC of the core network, and the MSC is connected to a GMSC<br>
(Gateway Mobile Switching Center) managing a connection to other networks.<br>
Meanwhile, in case of the packet switched service, services are<br>
provided by a SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and a GGSN (Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node) 37 of the core network.<br>
The SGSN supports a packet communication going toward the RNC,<br>
and the GGSN 37 manages connection to other packet switched networks (i.e,<br>
the Internet network).<br>
As the 3GPP system has decided to provide a multimedia broadcast<br>
multicast service (MBMS), a fresh service of Release 6, 3GPP TSG SA (Service<br>
and System Aspect defines network elements required for the MBMS service<br>
and functions of each network element.<br>
A cell broadcast service the conventional Release 99 has provided is<br>
limited to a service that a text type short message is broadcast to a certain area.<br>
Comparatively, the MBMS service provided by the Release 6 is an advanced<br>
service that not only broadcasts a multimedia but also multicasts the multimedia<br>
to terminals (UEs) which have subscribed for the corresponding service.<br><br>
The MBMS will now be described in detail.<br>
The MBMS, a downward-dedicated service, provides a streaming or<br>
background service to plural terminals by using a common or dedicated<br>
downward channel. The MBMS is divided into a broadcast mode and a<br>
multicast mode. The MBMS broadcast mode is a service transmitting<br>
multimedia data to every user located in a broadcast area, whereas the MBMS<br>
multicast mode is a service transmitting multimedia data to a specific user group<br>
located in a multicast area. The broadcast area signifies a broadcast service<br>
available area, and the multicast area signifies a multicast service available<br>
area.<br>
Users who desire to receive the MBMS service should receive a service<br>
announcement and a service notification provided by a network. The service<br>
announcement means informing the terminal of a list of services to be provided<br>
and its related information, and the service notification means informing the<br>
terminal of information on broadcast data to be transmitted.<br>
Especially, if the user intends to receive the multicast mode MBMS<br>
service, he/she should be admitted to a multicast subscription group. The<br>
multicast subscription group means a group of users who has finished an<br>
admission procedure. Once the user is admitted to the multicast subscription<br>
group, he/she can join a multicast group to receive a specific multicast service.<br>
In this case, the multicast group signifies a user group receiving the specific<br>
multicast service, and 'joining' means joining the multicast group gathered to<br>
receive the specific multicast service.<br><br>
The joining behavior is in other way called a MBMS multicast activation.<br>
Accordingly, the user can receive the specific multicast data through the MBMS<br>
multicast activation or the joining behavior.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic network structure for providing the MBMS<br>
service.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a broadcast multicast-service center (BM-SC)<br>
serves to schedule MBMS contents inputted from a contents provider. A cell<br>
broadcast center (CBC) is an entity (a physical or virtual unit handling a specific<br>
service) for providing an existing CBC service, that is, for broadcasting a text<br>
type short message to a certain area, and can be used for a service<br>
announcement of the MBMS service.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case of the packet switched service, the MBMS<br>
service is provided by an SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and a GGSN<br>
(Gateway GPRS Support Node) of the core network. The SGSN supports a<br>
packet communication toward a serving RNC (SRNC) of the UTRAN, and the<br>
GGSN manages connection to other packet switched networks such as the<br>
Internet through a border gateway (BG).<br>
In the UMTS system, a GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) layer is used to<br>
support transmission of the packet data. Specifically, the GTP layer is especially<br>
used for transmitting data of a service area. Thus, the GGSN manages a data<br>
transmission tunnel through the GTP layer in the existing UMTS packet domain,<br>
and generates and manages an MBMS context for the MBMS service.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a transmission procedure of an MBMS data.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, data to be transmitted to members of the<br>
multicast group is delivered from an MBMS data source to the GGSN through<br>
an IP multicast, and the GGSN generates a GTP tunnel and transmits an<br>
MBMS data to the SGSNs which manage users subscribed for the<br>
corresponding multicast service through the GTP tunnel. Each SGSN routes the<br>
MBMS data to each RNC managing corresponding users, and the RNC<br>
transmits the received MBMS data to a corresponding user cell (the area<br>
managed by one Node B).<br>
Accordingly, the specific MBMS service user located in the cell, that is,<br>
the specific terminals located in the corresponding multicast area, can be<br>
provided with the MBMS service upon receiving the MBMS data.<br>
If the BM-SC includes the function of the GGSN, the MBMS data can be<br>
directly delivered to the SGSN without passing through the GGSN, and the data<br>
would be transmitted to the other entities in the same manner.<br>
As mentioned above, the MBMS service includes the broadcast mode<br>
service and the multicast mode service. Unlike the broadcast mode service<br>
which broadcasts to all the area, the multicast mode service transmits data only<br>
to the users (terminals) admitted to the multicast group, of which the data is<br>
provided in a uni-directional point-to-multipoint transport method.<br>
With respect to providing the multicast service, demands that different<br>
information by areas should be provided for one service or demands that one<br>
service with different QoSs (Quality of Service) by areas should be provided are<br>
increasing. In addition, there should exist a variety of menus or channels for one<br><br>
service provided in the same area.<br>
However, currently, the 3GPP defines only the requirements for the<br>
MBMS service, failing to provide a substantial method as to how to perform the<br>
requirements.<br>
The above references are incorporated by reference herein where<br>
appropriate for appropriate teachings of additional or alternative details,<br>
features and/or technical background.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is implemented in a mobile communication<br>
system such as the UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications system)<br>
developed by 3GPP. Nonetheless, the present invention can be also adopted<br>
for a communication system operating in conformity to a different standard.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
The present invention proposes a method for discriminating a multicast<br>
service so that different information can be provided by areas for one service or<br>
a service can be provided with different QoS by areas.<br>
In addition, the present invention proposes a method for discriminating<br>
a multicast service so that diverse menus or channels may exist for one service.<br>
For this purpose, in the present invention, a data identifier can be attached to<br>
one multicast data stream. The data identifier may include a multicast service<br>
identifier and an identifier indicative of a kind of a corresponding multicast<br>
service. The identifier indicative of a kind of the service may include a multicast<br>
group ID, a multicast area ID and an UDP/TCP port number, etc.<br>
The selective service method in a multicast system in accordance with<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail<br><br>
with reference to Figure 4.<br>
In general, when a multicast service is provided, there may be several<br>
types of services related to one multicast group or there may be several<br>
multicast groups for one multicast service.<br>
In the present invention, the entire multicast area is classified by<br>
services, groups and RNCs. This classification can be defined by a member<br>
managing entity (i.e., SGSN, BM-SC and GGSN, etc.) of the core network or in<br>
the UTRAN in the future. For example, the member managing entity of the core<br>
network can define a multicast service and a concept of a multicast area<br>
providing the multicast service by using a logical structure as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Figure 5 shows an example of three types of multicast services, that is,<br>
first to third services SER1-SER3.<br>
The service should be differently provided in accordance with each area.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the first service SER1 is provided in ail multicast areas<br>
MA1-MA9. However, the second service SER2 is provided in only multicast<br>
areas MA1, MA2, MA4 and MA7 and the third service SER3 can be provided in<br>
only multicast areas MA3, MA5, MA6, MA8 and MA9.<br>
Also, a multicast group may exist for each of the services SER1~SER3.<br>
Namely, the first service SER1 is provided to both the multicast groups A and B,<br>
the second service SER2 is provided only to the multicast group A, while the<br>
third service SER3 is provided to the multicast group B. The multicast group A<br>
includes multicast areas of MA1, MA2, MA4 and MA7, while the multicast group<br>
B includes multicast groups of MA3, MA5, MA6 AND MA9.<br><br>
With such a logical structure, in spite of the same multicast service, a<br>
QoS and a transmission content (MBMS data) may differ according to the<br>
multicast group and the multicast area. Preferably, the multicast areas<br>
MA1~MA9 are mapped geographically. For instance, in consideration of the<br>
geographical area, the first RNC manages an area corresponding to the<br>
multicast areas MA1, MA4 and MA7, the second RNC manages an area<br>
corresponding to the multicast areas MA2, MA5 and MA8, and the third RNC<br>
manages an area corresponding to the multicast areas MA3, MA6 and MA9.<br>
Accordingly, a terminal belonging to the multicast areas MA1, MA2,<br>
MA4 and MA7 can be provided with the first service SER1 or second service<br>
SER2 by joining the multicast group A, while a terminal belonging to the<br>
multicast areas MA3, MA5, MA6A and MA9 can be provided with the second<br>
service SER2 or third service SER3 by joining the multicast group B.<br>
When the classification to the entire multicast area is completed, the<br>
member managing entity of the core network attaches an identifier for an MBMS<br>
service and an identifier indicative of a kind of a lower service of the MBMS<br>
service to the MBMS service data stream to be transmitted (step S2). The<br>
identifier indicative of a kind of a lower service of the MBMS service signifies an<br>
identifier indicative of a multicast group, a multicast area and an UDP/TCP port<br>
number. Nonetheless, in the present invention, without being limited thereto,<br>
various identifiers for providing the MBMS service can be attached to the MBMS<br>
service stream as necessary.<br>
Accordingly, in order to transmit and receiving the MBMS service<br><br>
discriminately, as shown in Figure 6, MBMS stream identifier is defined as<br>
follows.<br>
First, an MBMS stream identifier is defined to transmit different MBMS<br>
data by multicast groups for one service.<br>
Usually, a service such as weather information should be provided with<br>
different information by areas. In the present invention, in the case of the<br>
weather information service, the current weather information can be multicast<br>
appropriately to each area depending on areas. For example, as shown in<br>
Figure 5, the first service SER1 is provided to both multicast groups A and B,<br>
and in this respect, if the service subject is weather information, different<br>
weather information can be transmitted to each of the multicast groups A and B.<br>
Accordingly, in order to transmit weather information by discriminating the<br>
MBMS service, in the present invention, the MBMS service stream identifier can<br>
be defined by the below formula (1):<br>
MBMS service identifier = MBMS service ID + multicast group ID - (1)<br>
The MBMS service identifier defined in formula (1) is used to provide<br>
different MBMS service data by multicast groups for one multicast service or to<br>
provide the same data but with different QoSs by multicast groups for one<br>
service. The MBMS service identifier can be defined in the member managing<br>
entity (i.e., SGSN, BM-SC, GGSN, etc.) of the core network or can be defined in<br>
the UTRAN in the future.<br><br>
Figure 7 shows an example of transmitting MBMS service data by<br>
multicast groups by using the MBMS service identifier defined in formula (1).<br>
With reference to Figure 7, if the MBMS service data for the first service<br>
SER1 is transmitted to the multicast areas MA1, MA2, MA4 and MA7 belonging<br>
to the multicast group A, a MBMS service ID is set to '1' and a multicast group<br>
ID is set to 'A'. If an MBMS service data is transmitted to the multicast areas<br>
MA3, MA5, MA6 and MA9 belonging to the multicast group B, an MBMS service<br>
ID is set to '1' and a multicast group ID is set to 'B'.<br>
Second, in the present invention, in order to transmit different MBMS<br>
data by multicast areas for one service, an MBMS stream identifier is defined by<br>
the below formula (2):<br>
MBMS service identifier = MBMS service ID + multicast group ID +<br>
Multicast area ID--(2)<br>
The MBMS service identifier defined in formula (2) is used to transmit<br>
different MBMS service data by multicast areas for one multicast service or to<br>
provide the same data but different QoSs by multicast areas for one multicast<br>
service.<br>
If the MBMS service data for the first service SER1 is transmitted to the<br>
multicast area MA1 belonging to the multicast group A by using the MBMS<br>
service identifier defined in formula (2), the MBMS service ID is set to 1,<br>
multicast group ID is set to 'A' and multicast area ID is set to 1. Meanwhile, If<br>
the MBMS service data is transmitted to the multicast area MA4 belonging to<br><br>
the multicast group A by using the MBMS service identifier defined in formula<br>
(2), an MBMS service ID is set to 1, a multicast group ID is set to 'A' and a<br>
multicast area ID is set to 4.<br>
MBMS service identifiers can be set for the multicast areas MA2 and<br>
MA7 belonging to the multicast group A and the multicast areas MA3, MA5,<br>
MA6, MA8 and MA9 belonging to the multicast group B in the same manner.<br>
Third, in the present invention, an MBMS stream identifier can be<br>
defined to provide diverse menus or channels for one multicast service provided<br>
in the same area.<br>
Currently, a multicast service provided from the same service, for<br>
example, a paid TV service, provides various menus and channels. With such a<br>
multicast service, even if users have requested the same service in the same<br>
area, they may want different content of information. Thus, in order to meet their<br>
demand, it is necessary to provide a variety of channels so that they can select<br>
for their taste. Therefore, in the present invention, in order to provide diverse<br>
menus or channels for one multicast service provided in the same area, an<br>
MBMS service stream identifier is defined by the below formula (3):<br>
MBMS service identifier = MBMS service ID + multicast group ID +<br>
UDP/TCP port number - (3)<br>
In case where the MBMS service identifier defined in formula (3) is used,<br>
if a user terminal belonging to the multicast area MA1 uses a sub-menu 2of the<br>
first service SER1, an MBMS service ID is set to '1', a multicast group ID is set<br><br>
to 'A', and UDP/TCP port number is set to 1000. Meanwhile, if a user terminal<br>
belonging to the multicast area MA2 uses a sub-menu 3 of the first service<br>
SER1, an MBMS service ID is set to '1', a multicast group ID is set to 'A' and an<br>
UDP/TCP port number is set to 2000.<br>
If a user belonging to other multicast area uses a sub-menu of a<br>
specific service, the MBMS service stream identifier can be set in the same<br>
manner.<br>
Accordingly, a form of the MBMS service stream identifier including all<br>
the three methods can be expressed in the below formula (4):<br>
MBMS service identifier = MBMS service ID + multicast group ID +<br>
[multicast area ID] + [UDP/TCP port number]- - - (4)<br>
The multicast area IDA and the UDP/TCP port number in the brackets<br>
are not requisite but can be used as necessary. That is, in the present invention,<br>
in order to discriminate the MBMS service stream, the MBMS service stream<br>
includes the MBMS service ID and the multicast group ID. The MBMS service<br>
ID may be represented by including, for example, an access point number<br>
(APN) and an IP multicast address.<br>
Namely, the multicast area ID is additionally used in order to transmit<br>
different MBMS service stream by multicast areas for one service or in order to<br>
provide the same data but with different QoSs by multicast areas.<br>
The UDP/TCP port number can be additionally used in order to provide<br><br>
diverse menus or channels for one multicast service provided in the same area.<br>
Once the identifier for the MBMS service is attached to the MBMS data<br>
stream, the member managing entity of the core network multicasts a<br>
corresponding MBMS data stream to a terminal, and thereafter, when the<br>
MBMS data streams are completely transmitted, the process is terminated. If,<br>
however, there remain MBMS data streams to be transmitted, the operation<br>
after the step S2 is repeatedly performed.<br>
Accordingly, the terminal belonging to a specific group or a specific area<br>
can selectively receive the MBMS data on the basis of the MBMS data stream<br>
multicast from the member managing entity of the core network.<br>
As so far described, the selective service method of a multicast system<br>
in accordance with the present invention have the following advantages.<br>
That is, the multicast service stream identifier is provided so that each<br>
multicast area can receive different information for one service or one multicast<br>
service can be provided with different QoSs to areas.<br>
In addition, the multicast service stream identifier is provided by which a<br>
user can selectively receive diverse menus or channels for one multicast<br>
service provided in the same area. Thus, by providing the multicast service<br>
stream identifier, users' desires for various services can be satisfied.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and<br>
are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching<br>
can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the<br>
present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the<br><br>
claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended<br>
to cover the structure described herein as performing the recited function and<br>
not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.<br><br>
