COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FOOD PRODUCT WITH STABILIZED NON-PROTEIN AMINO ACIDS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
The Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 105/166, Back bay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
FOOD PRODUCT WITH STABILIZED NON-PROTEIN AMINO ACIDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a food product comprising a stabilized non-protein amino acid. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a food product, like a beverage composition, whereby the food product has stabilized non-protein amino acid. The non-protein amino acid is often plant derived, such as theanine, and the amino acid is unexpectedly stabilized by antioxidants present within the food product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTON<br>
Many different food products have been prepared in order to attract the attention of consumers. In fact, the modern consumer is particularly interested in nutritious foods which form part of a healthy life style. Examples of such foods include protein bars, foods with limited trans fatty acids, foods with low carbohydrate levels as well as foods that are rich in vitamins yet low in salt.<br>
Beverages can fit well within the healthy concept attitude since they too may be formulated with healthy additives. Also, tea, which has natural flavonoids, catechins and amino acids, remains a popular beverage enjoyed by many consumers.<br>
An amino acid, like theanine, is often desired since theanine has been found to have numerous beneficial effects on the human body and mind. Such beneficial effects include reduction of certain cancers, lowering blood pressure as well as improving mental acuity. Unfortunately, however, while such non-protein amino acids are desired, the same tend to not be very stable in food products. In fact, additives like theanine tend to break down in food products into components<br>
 <br>
like glutamic acid and ethylamine. Upon doing so, the desired effect of the nonprotein amino acid provided is often not seen.<br>
There is increasing interest to stabilize non-protein amino acids within food<br>
products in a manner that does not make such food products less appealing to<br>
the consumer. In fact, stabilizing non-protein amino acids with ingredients that<br>
also provide a positive benefit to consumers is desired.	This invention,<br>
therefore, is directed to a food product comprising stabilized non-protein amino acid. The food product of this invention also comprises antioxidants that unexpectedly stabilize the non-protein amino acid within the food product. Moreover, the food product of the present invention has excellent taste and appearance characteristics notwithstanding the presence of elevated levels of non-protein amino acids and antioxidants.<br>
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br>
Efforts have been disclosed for making tea products. In U.S. Published Application No. 2007/0248737, a process for preparing a tea product with theanine is described.<br>
Other efforts have been disclosed for making tea extracts. In WO 2006/037511, a process for extracting theanine from plant material is described.<br>
Still other efforts have been disclosed for making food products with theanine. In U.S. Patent No. 6,462,051, compositions with theanine and for reducing mental fatigue are described.<br>
None of the additional information above describes a food product having non-protein amino acid stabilized with antioxidant as set forth and described in the present invention.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to a food product comprising:<br>
(a)	intrinsic non-protein amino acid, extrinsic non-protein amino acid, or both; and<br>
(b)	intrinsic antioxidant, extrinsic antioxidant or both,<br>
the food product comprising from about 125 ppm to about 20,000 ppm non-protein amino acid and at least about 25 ppm antioxidant.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for making the food product of the first aspect of this invention.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention is directed to precursors suitable to be used to make the food product of the first aspect of this invention.<br>
Additional aspects of the present invention will more readily become apparent from the description and examples which follow.<br>
Non-protein amino acid as used herein is meant to mean an amino acid that is in free or combined form, but not in a protein. Food product, as used herein, is meant to mean a food product ready to consume, like, for example, a beverage (such as coffee, hot chocolate, milk-based product, fruit juice, energy drink, or tea beverage), spread, sauce, dip, spoonable dressing, ice cream, pasta-based composition, wheat-based composition, meal supplement or replacement drink, or meal supplement or replacement bar, or a mini-drink.<br>
Stabilized, as used herein, means at least about 20% more non-protein amino acid (and preferably, at least about 30%, and most preferably, at least about 40%) is present in the food product during its shelf-life and after about one<br>
 <br>
(1) month when compared to conventional food products not made according to this invention, whereby such stabilization can be the result of hydrogen bonding between the antioxidant and non-protein amino acids.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The only limitations with respect to the type of non-protein amino acids that may be used in this invention are that the non-protein amino acids can provide a benefit to consumers and be present in a food product. Often, the nonprotein amino acid employed in this invention is plant derived (i.e., isolated therefrom). Illustrative, yet not limiting examples of the types of non-protein amino acids that may be used in this invention include gamma-ethylamino-L-glutamic acid (L-theanine), gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), mixtures thereof or the like. While it is often preferred that the non-protein amino acids used in this invention are plant derived, it is within the scope of this invention to produce (chemically and/or biologically) such non-protein amino acids. Therefore, use of combinations of non-protein amino acids, like theanine, isolated from tea plants as well as theanine that is synthesized is within the scope of this invention.<br>
 <br>
L-theanine is conventionally isolated from tea plants by extracting the same from dry tea leaves. Production of theanine is also known. For example, Pseudomonas citronellosis GEA, isolated from natural soil, belongs to the genus Pseudomonas, and the species citronellosis and is a theanine producing bacteria with activities that transfer Y-glutamyl groups. With the same, theanine may be biologically produced by using glutaminase derived from the bacteria in a mixture of glutamine and ethylamine at an alkaline pH. Other methods for the synthesis of theanine include those that dehydrate glutamic acid to obtain L-pyrrolidone carboxylic acid which may be added to ethylamine to produce crystals of theanine. Such crystals may be purified via re-crystallization with an alcohol solution. The former method of theanine production is described in European Application No. EP 1544306 Al and the latter method is described in "The Journal of Tea Science", 2003 (Vol. 23) (No. 2) 99-104. Another method for making theanine includes the use of glutamic acid derivatives and condensation agents to eventually yield a product which may be stripped of adamantyioxycarbonyl groups and oxy tertiary butyl groups to produce theanine. Such a method is disclosed in more detail in Japanese Application No. 2006/083155 A. In an especially preferred embodiment, the non-protein amino acid used in this invention is theanine, and particularly, theanine isolated from tea leaves.<br>
Typically, the food product made according to this invention comprises from about 125 ppm to about 20,000 ppm non-protein amino acid (e.g., an amount higher than that found in a conventional tea beverage). In a preferred embodiment, the food product of the present invention comprises at least about 175 ppm non-protein amino acid, and most preferably, from about 200 ppm to about 3,750 ppm non-protein amino acid, including all ranges subsumed therein. While it is within the scope of this invention for all of the non-protein amino acid to be intrinsic, typically extrinsic non-protein amino acid is required in order to achieve the desired concentration within the food product of this invention. Often, at least about 25% of the non-protein amino acid employed is extrinsic, and preferably, at least about 65%, and most preferably, at least about 95% of<br>
 <br>
the non-protein amino acid employed in the food product of this invention is extrinsic.<br>
Regarding the antioxidants used in this invention, the only limitations with respect to the same are that they are suitable for use in food products.

Other antioxidants which may be used in this invention include catechol, bearberry, pomegranate and/or rooibos extract. Preferred flavonoids suitable for use in this invention are those which are isolated from citrus fruits (especially from orange juice concentrate), green tea or black tea. The most preferred flavonoids suitable for use in this invention are the catechins isolated from green tea, black tea or a mixture thereof.<br>
Often, the food product of the present invention comprises at least about 25 ppm antioxidants. Preferably, the food product of the present invention comprises antioxidant in an amount from about 0.2 to about 1,500 times the amount of non-protein amino acid. Most preferably, the food product of the present invention comprises from about 200 to about 1100 ppm antioxidant, including all ranges subsumed therein. Often, from about 2% to about 100% of the antioxidant used in the present invention is intrinsic. In the case of food<br>
