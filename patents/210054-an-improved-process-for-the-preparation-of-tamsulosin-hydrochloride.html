The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride. Tamsulosin hydrochloride is a widely used drug. for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. Tamsulosin hydrochloride has the formula-I given below.<br><br>
The process employs the novel intermediates quartermaster benzylidene ammonium salts, N-(phenyl substituted)-[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-[2-(4-methoxy-3-sulphamoylphenyl)-l(R)-methyl-ethyl]ammonium halides of the formula-II,<br><br>
where R represents H, 4-OCH3, 4-OH or 4-fluoro and X represents CI, Br or I.<br>
and Schiff s bases, novel phenyl substituted 2-methoxy-5-[(2R)-[( 1 -E/Z-phenyl methylene)amino]propyl]benzenesulfonamide of the formula-Ill.<br><br>
where R represents H, 4-OCH3, 4-OH or 4-fluoro.<br>
The novel intermediates of the above mentioned formulae-II &amp; III which are useful for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride and the processes for their preparation have been made the subject matters of our co pending  applications nos.  B/lVIAS/2002  &amp;  C/MAS/2002<br>
respectively.<br><br>
Prior Art:<br>
Tamsulosin hydrochloride is first disclosed in JP 55-14382 dt. 8-2-1980 and its equivalent US 4731,478 dt. 15/3/1988, wherein the intermediate R(-)-5-[(2-amino-2-methyl)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV is refluxed for 16hrs with another intermediate 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethylbromide of Formula-V in ethanol medium to obtain crude Tamsulosin base, which is purified by column chromatography to get pure base. The pure Tamsulosin base is treated with HCl in ethanol to obtund Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I in 36.8% of yield based on the expensive intermediate of formula-IV. The synthetic route is given below in scheme-A.<br><br>
further the reaction time required is very long (i.e) more than 16hrs resuming in poor yields. The expensive intermediate R(-)-5-[(2-amino-2-methyl)ethyl-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV is required in 2 mole equivalents to the other intermediate 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethylbromide of formula-V as the compound of formula-IV is reacted to form salt with the liberated HBr formed during the coupling reaction.<br><br>
It is also disclosed in JP 254326 and its Austrian equivalent patent AT 397960 B that R(-) 5-[(2-amino-2-methyl)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV is reacted with 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)acetaldehyde of formula-X, which is generated insitu by acid treatment of 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal of formula-VII to get an imine compound of formula-Vin. Then the imine compound of formula-VIII is reduced with either platinum oxide or sodium borohydride / sodium cyano borohydride and on further treatment with HCl to obtain Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I. The process for making compound of formula-VII is also disclosed. Guaiethol is reacted with bromo acetaldehyde diethylacetal of formula-IX using sodium hydride as base and dimethyl formamide as solvent. The reaction sequence is shown in scheme-B.<br><br>
1. For the preparation of intermediates 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) acetaldehyde of formula-X, more steps are involved and pyrophoric reagents like sodium hydride has to be used for synthesis of the compound of formula-X.<br><br>
2.	For the reduction of imine of formula-VIII expensive and pyrophoric hydrogenation<br>
catalyst platinum oxide has to be used and special hydrogenation equipment is necessary to<br>
carry out the catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
3.	For the reduction of imine of formula-VIII expensive reagent sodium borohydride / sodium<br>
cyano borohydride is necessary.<br>
JP 02306958 (1988-Hokuriku) discloses an alternate process for making Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I. (2R)-4-Methoxyphenylisopropylamine of formula-XI is reacted with 2-bromoacetic acid of formula-XII using pivaloyl chloride and triethylamine to obtain N-2-(bromo acetoxy)-2(R)-4-methoxyphenylisopropylamine of formula-XIII. The compound of formula-Xi is reacted with chloro sulphonic acid and then with ammonia solution to obtain its sulfonamide derivative of formula-XIV, which is reacted with guaiethol using potassium carbonate as base to obtain an amide derivative of formula-XV. The amide derivative of formula-XV is reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to secondary amine compound, which on treatment with HCl gives Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-L The synthetic route is outlined in the following scheme-C.<br><br><br>
The main drawbacks in this process are:<br>
1.	More steps are involved there-by making the route very cumbersome.<br>
2.	Highly pyrophoric and expensive reagent lithium aluminium hydride is necessary to carry out the reduction of amide to secondary amine.<br>
Recognizing the importance of Tamsulosin hydrochloride of the formula-I as a widely used drug for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, and taking into account the difficuhies of the hitherto known processes for its preparation, we under-took research to develop a simple, cheap and commercially viable process for producing Tamsulosin hydrochloride, starting with (R)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV.<br>
The main objective of the present invention, therefore, is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride, which is commercially viable.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride having single largest impurity less than 0.1% and total impurities less than 0.5%.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride having a chiral purity (enantiomeric excess) of more than 99.9%.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride, wherein the usage of specialized equipment like hydrogenate is not necessary thereby making the process simple.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride, wherein the usage of pyrophoric and expensive<br><br>
reagents like Lithium aluminium hydride, platinum oxide and also expensive reagent like sodium borohydride are not used thereby making the process safer and economical.<br><br>
The monoalkylation of the primary amine of formula-IV is carried out by the method of Decker &amp; Becker [Decker &amp; Becker, Ann, 395, 328 (1913)]. So far this method has not been used earner for making Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I.<br>
Which comprises following steps:<br>
(i) reacting the compound of the formula-IV with a substituted aromatic benzaldehyde of the<br>
formula-XVI, where R represents group such as H, 4-OH, 4-OCH3 or 4-fIuoro to obtain<br>
novel    compounds    namely	phenyl    substituted    2-methoxy-5-[(2R)-[( 1 -E/Z-<br><br>
pheylmethylene)amino] propyl] benzenesulfonamide of formula-III, where R represents H, 4-OH, 4-OCH3 or 4-fluoro<br>
(ii) reacting the resulting compound of the formula-III vent 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)<br>
ethylhalide of the formula-XVII, where the halo group is CI, Br or I at a temp<br>
in the range of 80  to 130° to obtain the novel quart Mary ammonium sacs,<br>

sulphamoyI-phenyl)-l(R)-methylethyl]ammonium halides of the formula-H, where R represents H, 4-OH, 4-OCH3 or 4-fluoro groups and X represents CI, Br or I<br>
(iii) hydrolysing the quart Mary ammonium sacs of the resulting compound of the formula-H by heating in water to obtain the corresponding hydrogen halide salts of formula-I<br>
(iv) neutralising the hydrogen halide salts of the formula-I thus obtained by conventional methods to produce the Tamsulosin base of the formula-XVIII, and<br>
(v) converting the Tamsulosin base of the formula XVIII into Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I by conventional methods.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the step (i) may be effected by isotopically removing the water using a solvent such as toluene, xylene etc. or by simultaneous distillation of the water formed using an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol etc. The reaction of step (ii) may be performed either neatly or by using solvent such as toluene, xylene, n-butanol, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide etc. The compound of formula-II is isolated by filtration or by removal of the solvent and by simple leaching with a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride etc., to remove the unreacted alkyl halide. In step (iii) the hydrolysis may be carried out using hot water. The liberated aldehyde, may be removed by steam distillation or by extraction with a solvent such as methylene chloride.<br>
The neutralization in step (iv) may be done using solutions of alkali bicarbonates, carbonates such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate etc. and sodium carbonate, potassium<br><br>
carbonate, etc and alkali hydroxides such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide etc, to obtain the crude base compound of Tamsulosin of formula-XVHI. The crude Tamsulosin base may be purified by column chromatography or by recrystallization using suitable solvents such mixtures of dimethyl formamide and acetonitrile, dimethyl formamide and isopropyl ether etc.<br>
The Tamsulosin hydrochloride is prepared using solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol etc and hydrogen chloride solution in isopropyl alcohol.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the reaction of the compound of the formula-I with a substituted aromatic benzaldehyde of the formula-XVI, where R represents group such as H, 4-OH, 4-OCH3 or 4-fluoro to obtain novel compounds namely phenyl substituted 2-methoxy-5-[(2R)-[( 1 -E/Z-pheylmethylene)amino]propyl]benzenesulfonamide of formula-III, where R represents H, 4-OH, 4-OCH3 or 4-fluoro.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the reaction of the resulting compound of the formula-Hi with 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethylhalide of the formula-XVII, where the halo group is CI, Br or I at a temp in the range of 80° to 130° to obtain the novel quart Mary ammonium salts, namely N-(phenyl substituted)-[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-[2-(4-methoxy-3-sulphamoylphenyl)-1 (R)-methyl-ethyl]ammonium halides of the formula-II, where R represents H, 4-OH, 4-OCH3 or 4-fluoro groups.<br>
