BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an adjustable wireless earphone, and particularly to an adjustable wireless earphone where the earphone body thereof can be rotated in all directions so that the plug-set thereof may tightly plug over the ear of the user and not easily drop out from the ear.<br>
2. Description of the prior art<br>
In order to reduce the rising incidence of traffic accidents due to handholding of mobile phone while driving, many countries have established relevant regulations to strictly forbid any driver from communicating by a handheld mobile phone with others during driving to reduce the traffic accident incidence effectively. Therefore, currently, among many products emerging to match up such government regulations, the most common product is a hand-free kit for mobile phone with a function whereby the driver places the mobile phone along with the hand-free kit in the seat before driving, so the speaker of the kit or the speaker system in the car will broadcast the communication message once a call inbounds. This practice can enable the driver to communicate with others without hand-holding a mobile phone. Since the hand-free kit is associated with the build-in speaker in the car, this may generate too much noise or echo when the driver is communicating with others, such that the inbound message can not be received clearly and there is no privacy if any other passengers are present. Therefore, such a hand-free kit is not designed properly.<br>
For solving the disadvantage derived from the prior art hand-free kit, now there are over-ear and headset wireless earphones available in the market; it may<br><br>
be put on the ear or the head of the user, without the fault of generating too much echoes and exposing the content of the communication while the driver is communicating with others. But, the commercially available over-ear or headset wireless earphone usually is die-cast with the wireless principal body, thus there is no way to adjust the angle of the earphone appropriately according to the shape of the ear or the head of the user, which makes the user feel uncomfortable.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that the above-described conventional articles still have many drawbacks. They are not designed properly, and need to be improved urgently.<br>
In view of the disadvantages derived from the above-described conventional earphone, the inventor had devoted to improve and innovate, and after studying intensively for many years, successfully developed this adjustable Bluetooth wireless earphone according to the present invention finally.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
