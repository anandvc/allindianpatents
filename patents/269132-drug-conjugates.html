For example, U.S. Patent 4,880,935 to Thorpe and U.S. Patent 5,936,092 to Slien, et al. disclose heterobifunctional compounds that contain a disulfide group; at one end and a carboxylate group at the other end. A cytotoxin is bound to the disulfide group at one end. An antibody is bound to the carboxylate group at the other end. Once in the targeted cell, the disulfide bond is cleaved by endogenous disulfide-reducing peptides, such as glutathione (GT). Cleavage of the disulfide bond releases the parent cytotoxin inside the targeted cell.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent 5,137,877 to Kaneko, et al., disclose heterobifunctiional compounds that contain a hydrazinyl group at one end and a disulfide group at the . other end. An anthracycline-based cytotoxin is bound to the hydrazinyl group. An antibody is bound to the disulfide group. The more acidic environment of the target cells causes hydrolysis of the hydrazinyl group. Hydrolysis of the hydrazinyl group releases the parent cytotoxin.<br>
However, a demonstrated release of the drug at a target does not necessarily make the heterobifimctional compound medically effective or desirable. Medical efficacy depends to a significant extent on the rate of release of the drug by the heterobifimctional compound.<br>
Accordingly, there have been efforts to increase the rates of release of drugs at a specified target by designing new heterobifunctional compounds. Most notable are efforts to design heterobifunctional compounds that, when hydrolyzed, undergo a favorable cyclization reaction to release the drug.<br>
For example, Y. Ueda et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1993, Vol. 3, No. 8, 1761-1766, disclose linkers that undergo phosphatase-inititiated lactonization of phosphonoxyphenylpropionate derivatives of Taxol. The lactonization results in the in vivo release of the parent Taxol. As shown in Ueda et al., the purpose of Ueda's phosphonoxyphenylpropionate group is to increase the water solubility of Taxol.<br>

WO 2005/079398	PCT/US2005/004715<br>
R. B. Greenwald et al., J. Med. Chem., 2000,43,475-487, disclose ester-containing compounds linked to a drug to form a pro-drug. The pro-drug is hydrolyzed by an esterase, which results in a lactonization reaction. The lactonization reaction releases the drug.<br>
K. Achilles, Arch. Phann. Pharm. Med. Chem., 2001, 334, 209-215, discloses esterase-initiated lactonization of heterobifunctional compounds containing a peptide binding agent and a pro-drug. The lactonization causes release of the drug. The peptides bind to polymorphonuclear elastase, a serine protease associated with numerous medical conditions, including cancer.<br>
Similarly, B. Wang et al; J. Org. Chem., 1997, 62, 1363-1367, disclose esterase-initiated lactonization of prodrugs containing cyclic peptides as binding agents.<br>
However, the efficacy of conjugates of the heterobifunctional compounds described above is, in the vast majority of cases, far from clinically useful. For example, it would be particularly beneficial to increase the rates of drug release of such conjugates in order to be clinically effective.<br>
Such targeted and effective rates of release of drugs have not yet been realized. In the case of targeting tumor cells, such high rates of release of anti-cancer drugs are particularly critical in light of the known high proliferation of cancer cells in tumors.<br>
In addition, the drug conjugate containing a linker should release the most active form of the drug. See I. Ojima, X. Geng, X. Wu, C. Qu, C. P. Borella,H. Xie, S. D. Wilhelm, B. A. Leece, L. M. Bartle, V. S. Goldmacher, and R. V. J. Chari, J. Med. Chem. 45, 5620-5623 (2002).<br>
Taxol, a diterpcne natural product, has gained prominence as one of the most efficacious anticancer drugs. See E. K. Rowinsky, Annual Review of Medicine 1997, 48, 353; M. Suffness, Taxol Science and Applications; CRC Press: New York, 1995.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2005/079398	PCT/US2005/004715<br>
Even more promising congeners of Taxol, termed taxoids (Taxol-like compounds), with orders of magnitude higher potency than Taxo'l have been developed. See G. I. Georg, T. Chen, I. Ojima, and D. M. Vyas (Eds.),"Taxane Anticancer Agents: Basic Science and Current Status", ACS Symp. Series 583; American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C, 1995); I. Ojima, et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1999, 9, 3423-3428; I. Ojima, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 3889-3896; and I. Ojima, G. D. Vite, K.-H. Altmann (Eds.), "Anticancer Agents: Frontiers in Cancer Chemotherapy", ACS Symp. Series 796, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C, 2001.<br>
However, Taxol, taxoids, and other cytotoxic anticancer drugs contain drawbacks, including high toxicity to normal cells, poor water solubility, and emergence of drug-resistance. Therefore, there has been particular interest in selectively and efficiently targeting tumor cells with cytotoxic anticancer drugs. See, for example, K. Achilles, Arch. Pharrn. Pharm. Med. Chem., 2001, 334,209-215, and U.S. Patent 5,137,877 to Kaneko, et al; R. V. J. Chari, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1998, 31, 89-104; MX. Disis and M. A.

Thus, there is a need for improving, inter alia, the specificity of drug delivery and the rates of release of various of drugs, including anticancer drugs. To achieve the above, there is a need for improved heterobifunctional linkers that bind a drug to a cell-specific marker, and that release the most active form of the drug in the target cell. There is a particular need for heterobifunctional linkers that selectively target tumor cells with highly potent cytotoxic drugs at a drug release rate that is effective for the destruction and/or inhibition of tumor cells.<br>

In another embodiment, J is a substituent that contaixis an activated ester, or a precursor thereof, and thus, permits a specific binding agent, such as an antibody, to bind to the disulfide end of the Z component without undergoing a thiol exchange process. Some classes of such J substituents include o:mega-hydroxycarbonyl-(lower<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2005/079398	PCT/US2005/004715<br>

Some suitable examples of such groups include 2-hydroxycarbonylethyl, 2-methoxycarbonylethyl, p-niixophenyloxycarbonylpropyl, pentafluorophenyloxycarbonylbutyl, 2-(succiminide-iV'-oxycarbonyl)-l-methylpropyl. As an example, an activated ester substituent J reacts with the lysine residues of a monoclonal antibody, another specific binding protein or a specific binding peptide to form a conjugate.<br>
In another embodiment, J is a specific binding agent. A specific binding agent is a protein, peptide, lectin, saccharide, or other moiety that selectively binds to a molecule on the surface of a cell. Some types of molecules on the surface of a cell that may be targeted by a specific binding agent include receptors, oligosaccharides&gt; lectins, adhesion molecules, proteoglycams, integrins, immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility complex, e.g., human leukocyte antigen, and glycoproteins. Some examples of receptors include tyrosine kinase receptors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, e.g., HER-1, HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4.<br>
A specific binding agent may, for example, be a receptor-specific ligand. A receptor-specific ligand is a natural or synthetic molecule, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter, which specifically binds to a receptor on the surface of a cell. Some examples of receptor-specific ligands include bombesin, transferrin, VEGF, and EGF.<br>
In another embodiment, the specific binding agent is a molecule that comprises the hypervariable region (CDR) of an antibody and has binding characteristics that are the same as, or comparable to, those of the whole antibody. Preferably, the specific binding agent is an antibody or a functional equivalent of an antibody, such as a fragment of an antibody. More preferably, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody or a functional equivalent derived from a monoclonal antibody.<br>
Suitable fragments of antibodies include any fragment that comprises a sufficient portion of the hypervariable region to bind specifically, and with sufficient affinity, to a molecule on the surface of a cell. Such fragments may, for example,<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2005/079398	PCT/US2005/004715<br>
contain one or both Fab fragments, or the F(ab')2 fragment. Preferably, the antibody fragments contain all six complementarity determining regions of the whole antibody, although functional fragments containing fewer than all of such regions, such as three; four or five CDRs, may also be suitable.<br>
The preferred fragments are single chain antibodies, or Fv fragments. Single chain antibodies are polypeptides that comprise at least the variable region of the heavy chain of the antibody linked to the variable region of the light chain, with or without an interconnecting linker. These chains may be produced in bacteria or in eucaryotic cells.<br>
The antibodies and functional equivalents may be members of any class of immunoglobulins, such as: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE, and the subclasses thereof, The preferred antibodies are members of the IgGl subclass. The functional equivalents may also be equivalents of combinations of any of the above classes and subclasses.<br>
Suitable variable and hypervariable regions of antibodies may be derived from antibodies produced by any mammal in which monoclonal antibodies are made. Some examples of suitable mammals include rabbits, rats, mice, horses, goats, and primates. Preferably, the monoclonal antibodies are derived from mice. The monoclonal antibodies thus obtained are humanized by methods known in the art for the purpose of human clinical use.<br>
In Y and Z, each of a, b, c, d, e and f independently represents 0 or 1, with 1jhe provisions that a + c equals 0, 1, or 2; b + d equals 0, 1, or 2; a + b + c + d + e + f equals 1, 2, or 3; additionally provided that when f is 1, then d is 1, and when d is Oi, then f is 0; and when both e and b are 0, then neither R1 nor R2 is chloro or bromo.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be linked to a pharmaceutically active chemical component G, or a precursor thereof, by methods known in the art. For example, the carbonyl group in the compound may first be reacted with a suitable activating compound to attach an activating group X-G. Some examples of activating<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2005/079398	PCT/US2005/004tl5<br>
compounds, or a combination of activating compounds, capable of attaching an activating group X-G onto the compounds of the invention, include the combination of 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) or 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; N-hydroxysuccmimide; and p-(N,N-dknethylarnino)pyridine (DMAP). The resulting; activated ester of the compound is reacted with, for example, a drug or pro-drug bearing a suitable nucleophilic group or groups, as described above. The drug thereby becomes linked to the carboxyl end of the Y component of the compound.<br>
Similarly, the compounds of the present invention may be linked to a specific binding agent by methods known in the art. The disulfide group in component Z will undergo the well known thiol exchange process in the presence of a specific binding agent bearing at least one thiol group. A disulfide-activating group is not required under all conditions, but may be used to hasten the reaction. The specific binding agent thereby becomes linked to the compound through a disulfide group on the Z component.<br>
Alternatively, a specific binding agent may be modified to contain activated disulfide linkages in order to react with the reduced thiol form of the Z component when Y possesses a carboxylic acid terminus, i.e., when v is 0 and J is hydrogen, a metal ion, or a quaternary ammonium ion, and X is O and G is H The disulfide-activated specific binding agent binds to the reduced thiol form of Z through the disulfide exchange process.<br>
The modification of specific binding agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, with an acyl group bearing an activated disulfide moiety is well known in the art. [See R. V. J. Chari, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1998, 31, 89-104; I. Ojima, X. Geng, X. Wu, C. Qu, C. P. Borella, H. Xie, S. D. Wilhelm, B. A. Leece, L. M. Bartle, V. S. Goldmacher, and 11. V. J. Chan, J. Med. Chem. 45, 5620-5623 (2002)]. Specific binding proteins such as monoclonal antibodies bearing thiol groups can be readily generated from activated disulfide derivatives by appropriate reducing agents known in the art. [See, for example, Trail, P. A.; Willner, D.; Knipe, J.; Henderson, A. J.; Lasch, S. J.; Zoeclder, M. E.; TrailSmith, M. D.; Doyle, T. W.; King, H. D.; Casazza, A. M.; Braslawsky, G.

The resulting conjugate containing the specific binding agent may be further coupled to, for example, a drug, bearing a hydroxyl, thiol, or amine moiety through the condensation reaction between the carboxylic acid terminus in the Y component of the conjugate via an activated ester, as described above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, G is a pharmaceutically active chemical compound, preferably a drug, and J is a specific binding agent, preferably a molecule comprising the hypervariable region (CDR) of an antibody. The above combination of G and J forms a linker drug conjugate.<br>
Although not bound by any theory, the invention is believed to work as follows. First, the linker drug conjugate binds to a cell by the attachment of the specific binding agent. The linker drug conjugate is internalized into the cell through, for example, endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond of the linker drug conjugate undergoes cleavage by an endogenous peptide that cleaves disulfide bonds, e.g., glutathione (GT). Glutathione is found in most mammalian cells and its level is considerably elevated in hypoxic cells such as tumor cells. The cleavage of the disulfide bond causes the release of the specific binding agent. Simultaneously, a thiolactonization process occurs between the remaining sulfur atom and the ester, thioester or amide linkage of the drug. The end result of the thiolactonization process is the release of the original and the most active form of the drug, inside of the targeted cell. The reaction scheme below is provided for further elucidation of the process.<br>

This application asserts priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/544,033, filed cm February 12, 2004. The specification of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/544,033 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The present hrvention was made with government support under Grant No. R01 GM427980 as well as R01CA103314 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The United States government has certain rights in this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The advantage of drugs that are capable of selectively targeting a specific cell type is well recognized. Thus, designing such selective drugs is a field of intense1 study. Such drugs are often, but by no means always, anticancer drugs.<br>
Of importance ;in this regard, are drugs (or pro-drugs) that are bound to a marker. The purpose of the marker is to direct the drug to a marker-specific target cell. For example, binding drugs to antibodies for the purpose of targeting antibody-specific cells, such as tumor cells, is well known.<br>
Binding a marker directly to a drug is, however, not always feasible. In addition, binding a marker directly to a drug often has the effect of dramatically reducing the efficacy of the drug, or disabling the action of the drug completely.<br>
One approach to reducing the loss of efficacy of a drug bound to a marker is to bind the marker to the drug in a way that causes the drug to be released at the target in its most active form (usually the parent drug itself). In this regard, there has been intense interest in finding heterobifunctional compounds, or linkers, that not only bind a marker and a drug, but that also cause the drug to be released in its most active fornti at the appropriate time.<br><br>
