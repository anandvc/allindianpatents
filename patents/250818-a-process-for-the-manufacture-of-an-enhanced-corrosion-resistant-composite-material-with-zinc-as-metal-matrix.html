				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix. The present invention particularly relates to a process for the manufacture of a novel zinc -metal oxides based composite material having enhanced corrosion resistance, wherein the source of multiple metal oxides is such as flyash, an industrial waste material, or an admixture of multiple metal oxides.<br>
In the galvanic series of metals in sea water, zinc occupies the most active position next only to magnesium. Since magnesium is highly reactive and is too rapidly consumed, zinc is the most preferred metal for conferring galvanic protection to steel substrates. Compared to two other active metals, namely magnesium and aluminum, zinc is heavier with a density of 7.1 gm/cm3. Reference may be made to Dale CH Nevison, ASM hand book, volume 13 -corrosion, pp 755 - 769, published by ASM international New York, 1996.<br>
Zinc ranks 27th in order of abundance of the chemical elements. The major application is galvanizing. Galvanizing zinc is primarily applied to finished parts such as sheets, wires strips and tubes. Historically zinc was one of the very first metals to be used as a galvanic anode. Early in the 19th century Sir Humphray Davy secured pieces of zinc to the copper sheathing in wood hulls of British Navy vessels to prevent severe underwater corrosion of the copper.<br>
The automotive industry uses by far the largest number of zinc alloy die castings such as carburetors, bodies for fuel pumps, wind shield wiper parts, speedometer frames. Zinc die castings are also used in washing machines, oil burners, stokers, motor housings, vacuum cleaners, electric clocks, building hard wares and are also used in business machines.<br>
However, the inferior corrosion resistance of zinc poses a severe limitation to its wide spread use for industrial applications.<br><br>
Reference may be made to Van No Strand's Scientific Encyclopedia 8th edition edited by Douglas M.Considire and published by Van No Strand Rein How, New York (1995), pp 3375 - 3377, wherein the following drawbacks associated with zinc have been mentioned<br>
a)	Zinc is readily oxidized in the presence of hydroxide ions e.g. H20.<br>
b)	In   industrial   or   marine   locations,   condensed   dew   is   likely   to   be<br>
contaminated with impurities that are corrosive to zinc. Sulphur dioxide<br>
being one of the most harmful pollutants.<br>
c)	Water hardness is an important variable in zinc corrosion. The corrosion<br>
rate of zinc in hard water may be 15 urn / year but in soft water it can be<br>
10 times higher.<br>
d)	When zinc is used in contact with water in a closed system, inhibitors are<br>
frequently used to minimize corrosion.<br>
e)	Zinc is usually not considered to be a useful metal in the acidic or strongly<br>
alkaline chemical environment<br>
f)	Zinc alloy containing aluminum are susceptible to intergranular corrosion<br>
at elevated temperatures.<br>
Reference may be made to control of pipe line corrosion edited by A.W.Peabody and Published by National Association of Corrosion Engineers, Texas USA (1967) pp 119, wherein it has been stated that zinc used for soil anodes should be high purity zinc such as special high grade classification which is at least 99.99 percent pure zinc.<br>
Reference may be made to T.P. Cheng, J.T. Lee, K.L. Lin, and W.T. Tsai, Corrosion Volume 47, No. 6 (1991) pp 436 - 442, wherein it has been stated that 5% Al - Zn and 55% Al - Zn coatings are much inferior to that of galvanized coating in alkaline conditions and that they are not suitable for application in reinforcements.<br><br>
In the hitherto known prior art, either electrochemically active metals such as Aluminum, Magnesium have been used as alloying elements or graphite fibers as reinforcing elements. All these elements are electrically conducting and hence contribute to corrosion of base metal zinc in one wav or other.<br>
From the hitherto known prior art it is clear that there is a definite need to overcome the inferior corrosion resistance of zinc which poses a severe limitation to its wide spread use for industrial applications.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal mairix, which improves the performance of commercially pure zinc without any metallic alloying elements.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of a novel zinc - metal oxides based composite material which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for improved performance of commercially pure zinc by admixing, at the time of casting, a multiple metal oxide system in finest form, so as to form a synergistic metal matrix composite having enhanced corrosion resistance properties.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for improved performance of commercially pure zinc by admixing, at the time of casting, flyash containing multiple metal oxides, so as to form a synergistic metal matrix composite having enhanced corrosion resistance properties.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix. The process comprises of finely dispersing multiple metal oxides, such as nonconducting, semi-conducting oxides, into molten commercially pure zinc under stirring to obtain a homogenous composite mass. The source of multiple metal oxides is such as flyash, an industrial waste product, or an admixture of multiple metal oxides, essentially consisting of silicon dioxide, aluminum trioxide, iron oxide. The zinc metal matrix composite has enhanced corrosion resistance properties and is thus suitable for industrial applications.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix, which comprises preparing a melt of pure zinc in the presence of flux by known methods, uniformly dispersing into 95 to 99 wt% of the said zinc melt under stirring an admixture of multiple metal oxides such as flyash, an industrial waste product essentially consisting of SiO2 in the range 1 to 3 wt%, Al2O3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt% and Fe2O3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt%, to obtain a homogenous corrosion resistant composite material, casting into a mould by known methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the pure zinc is commercially available pure zinc having 99.9% purity.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the flux is commercially available flux based on a mixture of crystals of ammonium chloride.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the admixture of multiple metal oxides, is such as flyash, an industrial waste product, essentially consisting of SiO2 in the range 1 to 3 wt%, Al2O3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt% and Fe2O3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt%. <br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the multiple metal oxides is such as non-conducting, semi-conducting oxides admixture of metal oxides of pigment grade (95 % pure) silicon dioxide, AR grade aluminium trioxide and AR grade ferric oxide,<br>
In hitherto known prior art, alloying elements used are electrochemically active metals such as aluminum, manganese and reinforcing elements used is graphite fibers. All these elements are electrically conducting and hence contribute to corrosion of base metal zinc in one way or other. On the other hand, if nonconducting or semi-conducting oxides are introduced in the metal matrix, they may increase the resistance of the system and thereby reduce the corrosion rate. Such non-conducting or semi-conducting oxides are to be kept within optimum limits so as to retain the functional efficiency of the base metal i.e. zinc. Use of multiple oxides such as silicon dioxide, aluminum trioxide, iron oxide will have a balancing effect on the overall corrosion resistance.<br>
Novelty of the present invention resides in providing a process for the manufacture of a novel zinc - metal oxides based composite material having enhanced corrosion resistance, wherein the source of multiple metal oxides is such as flyash, an industrial waste material, or an admixture of multiple metal oxides. Fly ash, an industrial waste product, can serve as an abundant source of multiple oxides.<br>
It has been possible to achieve the above noted novelty by the non-obvious inventive step of uniformly dispersing into 95 to 99 wt% of commercial pure zinc melt under stirring flyash or an admixture of multiple metal oxides, essentially consisting of SiO2 in the range 1 to 3 wt%, AI2C&gt;3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt% and Fe203 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt%, to obtain a homogenous composite mass.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE - 1 Casting of composite material based on multiple oxides in flyash:<br>
950 gms of commercially pure zinc (99.9% purity) was weighed and taken in a one litre capacity graphite crucible. The crucible was then kept in an open cupola type furnace and the content was heated. When the zinc metal started melting, 20 gms of a commercially available flux based on a mixture of crystals of ammonium chloride was thrown over the molten metal. Then 25 gms of multiple metal oxides in the form of fly ash containing 15 gms of silicon dioxide 75 gms of aluminum trioxide and 2.5 gms of iron oxide were first added and stirred with a graphite rod. Immediately on addition, there was reduction in temperate and the melt tended to become semisolid. The heating was maintained to reach a temperature of 400°C and remaining 25 gms of multiple metal oxides in the form of fly ash were added and stirred till a homogeneous molten mixture was formed. This molten mixture was simultaneously poured into a plate type graphite die and a cylinder type graphite die so as to have cast plates of size 150x50x3mm and cast rods of size 15mm dia and 120 mm length. These cast plate and rod materials were suitably cut and used in the subsequent evaluation studies.<br>

gms of a commercially available flux based on crystals of ammonium chloride was thrown over the molten metal. Then 10 gms of pigment grade silicon dioxide (95 % pure) and 5 grams of aluminium trioxide (AR grade) and 5 grams of ferric oxides (AR grade) were added and stirred with a graphite rod, till a homogeneous molten mixture was formed. The molten mixture was simultaneously poured in to a plate type graphite die and cylinder type graphite die so as to have cast plates of size 150 x 50 x 3mm and cast rods of size 15mm dia and 120mm length. These cast plate and rod materials were suitably cut and used in the subsequent evaluation studies.<br>

1000 gms of commercially pure zinc (99.99% purity) was weighed and taken in a one litre capacity graphite crucible. The crucible was then kept in an open cupola type furnace and the content was heated. When the zinc metal started melting, 20 gms of a commercially available flux based on a mixture of crystals of ammonium chloride was thrown over the molten metal and stirred with a graphite rod, till a homogeneous molten mixture was formed. The molten mixture was simultaneously poured in to a plate type graphite die and cylinder type graphite die so as to have cast plates of size 150 x 50 x 3mm and cast rods of size 15mm dia and 120mm length.

EXAMPLE-10 Evaluation of galvanic corrosion in concrete medium:<br>
A mild steel reinforcement specimen of size 8mm dia and 10.5 cm long was embedded in concrete prism of size 20x10x1 Ocm with a clear cover of 6 cm from the top surface. A hydroxyl ion reversible electrode (HRE) of size 0.5 cm dia and 4cm long was simultaneously embedded along with mild steel reinforcement at an inter electrode spacing of 0.5 cm.

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
(i) Fly ash, an abundantly available industrial waste product is utilized in making this composite material. This leads to efficient and eco-friendly consumption of this waste product in the process.<br>
(ii) There is no need to specifically control the impurities within critical limits. This makes the process simple.<br>
(iii) Enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix, which avoids the use of alloying elements used in the prior art, such as aluminum, manganese, which are electrochemically active metals and hence contribute to corrosion of base metal zinc in one way or other.<br><br>
(iv) There is no need to specifically add the conventional alloying elements such as aluminum, magnesium. This leads to conservation of scarcely available metals.<br>
(v) The newly developed composite material has better corrosion resistance in chloride as well as lime media and saturated calcium hydroxide containing 1500 ppm chloride compared to commercially available pure zinc metal.<br>
(vi) The newly developed composite material has better galvanic corrosion resistance in chloride as well as lime media and saturated calcium hydroxide containing chloride compared to commercially pure zinc metal.<br>
(vii) The newly developed composite material has better anode efficiency in lime media and saturated calcium hydroxide containing chloride compared to commercially pure zinc metal.<br>
(viii) The newly developed composite material is having better galvanic corrosion resistance in concrete medium compared to commercially available pure zinc metal.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix, which comprises preparing a melt of pure zinc in the presence of flux by known methods, uniformly dispersing into 95 to 99 wt% of the said zinc melt under stirring an admixture of multiple metal oxides such as flyash, an industrial waste product essentially consisting of SiO2 in the range 1 to 3 wt%, Al2O3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt% and Fe2O3 in the range 0.5 to 2 wt%, to obtain a homogenous corrosion resistant composite material, casting into a mould by known methods.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pure zinc is commercially available pure zinc having 99.9% purity.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 - 2, wherein the flux is commercially available flux based on a mixture of crystals of ammonium chloride.<br>
4.	A process for the manufacture of an enhanced corrosion resistant composite material with zinc as metal matrix, substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.</td>
