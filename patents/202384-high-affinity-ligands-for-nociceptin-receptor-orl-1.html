				<td>HIGH   AFFINITY   LIGANDS FOR   NOC1CEPTIN   RECEPTOR   ORL-1<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The noC1ceotm receptor ORL-1 has been shown to be involved with modulation of pain in animaf models.  ORL-1 (the noC1ceptin receptor)  was discovered as an "orphan opioid-like receptor" i.e. a receptor whose ligand was unknown.  The noC1ceptin receptor is a G protein coupled receptor.  While highly related in structure-to the three classical opioid receptors, i.e. the targets for traditional opioid analgesics, it is not activated by endogenous opioids.   Similarly, endogenous opioids fail to activate the noC1ceptin receptor.  Like the classical opioid receptors, the noC1ceptin receptor has a broad distribution in the central nervous system.<br>
In late 1995, noC1ceptin was discovered and shown to be an endogenous peptide ligand that activates the noC1ceptin receptor.   Data included in the initial publications suggested that noC1ceptin and its receptor are part of a newly discovered pathway involved in the perception of painful stimuli.  Subsequent work from a number of laboratories has shown that noC1ceptin, when administered intraspinally to rodents, is an analgesic. The efficacy of noC1ceptin is similar to that of endogenous opioid peptides.  Recent data has shown that noC1ceptin acts as an axiolytic when administered directly into the brain of rodents. When tested in standard animals models of anxiety, the efficacy of noC1ceptin is similar to that seen with classical  benzodiazapine anxiolytics. These data suggest that a small molecule agonist of the noC1ceptin receptor could have significant analgesic or anxiolytic activity.<br>
Additional recent data (Rizzi, et al. Life ScL 64. (1999), p. 157-163) has shown that the activation of noC1ceptin receptors in isolated guinea pig bronchus inhibits tachykinergic non adrenergic-non<br><br>
cholinergic contraC1icn, indicating that noC1ceptin receptor agonists could be useful in the treatment of asthma. Also, it has been reported (C1ccoC1oppo et al, Phvschpharmacology, 141 (1999), p. 220-224) noC1ceptin reduces the rewarding properties of ethanol in msP alcohol preferring rats, suggesting that intervention of noC1ceptin could be useful in the treatment of alcohol abuse.  In EP 856,514, 8-substituted 1,3,8-triazaspiro(4,5]decan-4-on derivatives were disclosed as agonists and/or antagonists of orphanin FQ (i.e., noC1ceptin) useful in the treatment of various disorders, including depression;   2-oxoimidazole derivatives disclosed in W098/54168 were desC1-ibed as having similar utility. Earlier, benzimidazoiyl piperidines were disclosed in U.S. 3,318,900 as having analgesic activity.<br>
Potent analgesic agents such as traditional opioids, e.g. morphine, carry with them significant side-effects.  Clinically relevant side-effects include tolerance, physical dependence, respiratory depression and a deC1-ease in gastrointestinal motility.   For many patients, particularly those subjected to chronic opioid therapy, i.e. cancer patients, these side effects limit the dose of opioid that can be administered.  Clinical data suggests that more than one-third of cancer patients have pain which is poorly controlled by present agents.  Data obtained with noC1ceptin suggest the potential for advantages over opioids.  When administered chronically to rodents, noC1ceptin, in contrast to morphine, showed no addiction liability.  Additionally, chronic morphine treatment did not lead to a "C1-oss-tolerance" to noC1ceptin, suggesting that these agents act via distinct pathways.<br>
In view of the current interest in pain relief, a welcome contribution to the art would be additional compounds useful for modifying the effect of noC1ceptin, a natural ligand to ORL-1 and therefore useful in the management of pain and anxiety.  Such a contributioQ is provided by this invention.<br>

Compounds of the invention can be prepared by known methods from starting materials either known in the art or prepared by methods known in the art.  Examples of general procedures and speC1fic preparative examples are given below.<br>
Typically, X1 ,X2-substituted piperidines are alkylated with Z1,Z2,Z3-substituted halomethanes in the presence of excess bases such as K2CO3 and Et3N, in solvents such as DMF, THF or CH3CN, at<br>
■<br>
room temperature or at elevated temperatures.<br>
X1 ,X2-substituted piperidines are either commerC1ally available or made by known procedures.   For example, 4-hydroxy-4-phenyl-piperidine can be converted to a 4-ffioc-amino-4-phenylpiperidine according to the following reaction scheme, wherein Bn is benzyl, Ph is phenyl and fBoc is t-butoxycarbonyl:<br><br><br>
group and the resulting intermediate is then treated with MeaSiCN. The resultant amide is hydrolyzed with aqueous HC! in CH3OH to produce the 4-amino compound.  The amino group is protected with tBoc and the N-benzyl group is removed by hydrogenolysis to produce the desired 4-amino-ptperidine derivative.<br>
The 4-{protected)amino-piperidine then can be reacted with a Z1,Z2,Z3-halomethane and the protecting group removed.  The amine (i.e., X2 is -NH2) can undergo various standard conversions to obtain amine derivatives. For example, the amine of formula I can be reacted with a R22-carboxaldehyde in the presence of a miid reduC1ng agent such as Na(OAc)3BH or with a compound of the formula R22-L, wherein L is a leaving group such as C1 or Br, in the presence of a base such as Et3N.<br>
An alternative method for preparing compounds of formula I wherein X1 is R7-aryl and X2 is OH involves alkylating a 4-piperidone hydrochloride with a Z1,Z2,Z3-ha!omethane, then reacting the ketone with an appropriately substituted R7-pheny(magnesium bromide or with a compound of the formula X1-!.1, wherein L1 is Br or I, and n-butyl-lithium.<br>
X1,X2-substituted campounds of formula I can be converted into other compounds of formula I by performing reactions well known in the art on the X1 and/or X2 substituents.  For example, a carboxaldehyde-substituted piperidine (i.e., X2 is -CHO) can be converted to a substituted piperidine wherein X2 is R13-0-CH2-, as shown in the following procedure for a compound of formula I wherein X1 is phenyl, Z1 and Z2 are each phenyl, and R1, R2, R3 and R4, and 7? are H :<br><br><br>
containing heterocycle having an R11 substituent other than hydrogen are prepared by reacting the corresponding compounds wherein R11 is hydrogen with a compound of the formula R11L (R11 is not H, and L is as<br>
*<br>
defined above).<br>
Alternatively, X1,X2-substituted piperidine starting materials can be converted into other X1,X2-substituted piperidines by similar procedures before reacting with the Z1 ,Z2,Z3-substituted halomethane.<br>
For compounds of formula I wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 variously form alkylene bridges, commerC1ally available N-protected 4-<br><br><br>
prepare compounds wherein the Z substnuents are other than phenyl.<br>
Compounds of the present invention and preparative starting materials thereof, are exemplified by the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure-<br>

Cough Studies<br>
The effects of noC1ceptin agonist Compound A (0.3 - 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and Compound B (10 mg/kg, p.o.)<br><br><br>
were evaluated in capsaiC1n-induced cough in the guinea pig according to the methods of Bolser et al. British Journal of Pharmacology (1995) 114, 735-738. This model is a wideiy used method to evaluate the activity of potential antitussive drugs.  Overnight fasted male Hartley guinea pigs (350-450 g, Charles River, Bloomington, MA, USA) were placed in a 12" x 14" transparent chamber.  The animals were exposed to aerosolized capsaiC1n (300 p.M, for 4 min) produced by a jet nebulizer (Puritan Bennett, Lenexa, KS, USA) to eliC1t the cough reflex. Each guinea pig was exposed only once to capsaiC1n. The number of coughs were detected by a miC1-ophone placed in the chamber and verified by a trained observer. The signal from the miC1-ophone was relayed to a polygraph which provided a record of the number of coughs.  Either vehicle (methylceltuiose \ ml/kg, p.o.) or Compound A or Compound B were given 2 hours before aerosolized capsaiC1n.  The antitussive activity of baclofen {3 mg/kg, p.o.) was also tested as a positive control. The results are summarized in the bar graph in Fig. 1.<br>
EXAMPLE   13 Respiratory Measurements<br>
Studies were performed on male Hartley guinea pigs ranging in weight from 450 to 550"g. The animals were fasted overnight but given water and libitum.  The guinea pigs were placed in a whole-body, head-out plethysmograph and a rubber collar was placed over the animal"s head to provide an airtight seal between the guinea pig and the plethysmograph. Airfiow was measured as a differential pressure aC1-oss a wire mesh sC1-een which covered a 1-in hole in the wall of the plethysmograph. The airflow signal was integrated to a signal proportional to volume using a preamplifier C1rcuit and a pulmonary<br><br>
function computer (Buxco Electronics, Sharon, CT., model XA).  A head chamber was attached to the plethysmograph and air from a compressed gas source (21%C&gt;2, balance N2) was C1rculated through the head chamber for the duration of study. All respiratory measurements were made while the guinea pigs breathed this C1rculating air.<br>
The volume signal from each animal was fed into a data acquisition/analysis system (Buxco Electronics, model XA) that calculated tidal volume and respiratory rate on a breath-by-breath basis. These signals were visually displayed on a monitor.  Tidal volume and respiratory rate were recorded as an average value every minute.<br>
The guinea pigs were allowed to equilibrate in the plethysmograph for 30 min.  Baseline measurements were obtained at the end of this 30 min period. The guinea pigs were then removed from the plethysmograph and orally dosed with Compound A from Example 12 (10 mg/kg, p.o.}, baclofen (3 mg/kg, p.o.) or a methylcellulose vehicle placebo (2 ml/kg, p.o.).  Immediately after dosing, the guinea pigs were placed into the plethysmograph, the head chamber and C1rculating air were reconnected and respiratory variables were measured at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post treatment. This study was performed under ACUC protocol #960103.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The data for tidal volume (Vj), respiratory rate (f) and minute volume (MV ~ Vj X f) were made for the baseline condition and at each time point after the drug or vehicle. The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The results are shown in Figures 2A, 2B and 2C.  Fig. 2A shows the change in Tidal Volume, Fig. 2B shows the change in Tidal Volume and Fig. 20 shows the change in frequency of breaths.<br>
