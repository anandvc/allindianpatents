NON-POLYMERIC HEMATOPOIETIC CELL CLOTS FOR DELIVERY OF ACTIVE <br>
AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to active agent delivery, and more particularly, to a non-<br>
polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot to aid in the delivery of an active agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The treatment of cartilage, bone, vertebral disc, and soft tissue lesions with biological<br>
factors and cells is an emerging approach for the enhancement of defect repair. The<br>
administration of recombinant proteins and protein growth factors to encourage tissue<br>
regrowth, leads to disappointing results as the maintenance of therapeutic concentrations<br>
requires very high loading doses or repeat administration, thereby decreasing the efficiency of<br>
repair, while increasing the cost, complexity, and the risk of generating unwanted side effects<br>
from exposure of non-target organs.<br>
One approach designed to facilitate the application of recombinant proteins to tissue<br>
repair has been to incorporate them into a biocompatible matrix or slow release device for<br>
implantation into a tissue defect, thereby localizing the proteins to the site of damage and<br>
possibly provide a three-dimensional structure for emigrating cells to colonize. Matrices that<br>
have been evaluated for repair of musculoskeletal tissues include a variety of synthetic and<br>
natural polymers. These systems also have limitations in that the proteins loaded into the<br>
matrix can be extraordinarily expensive to produce in quantity, rarely have prolonged and<br>
uniform releases, while the newly forming repair tissue can be adversely influenced by the<br>
presence of a foreign., implanted material. Gene transfer offers an approach that may overcome<br>
the many limitations of protein delivery to damaged tissues.1<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention presents a novel system for the application of active substances, such as<br>
gene delivery vehicles, cells and soluble proteins for the healing of damaged tissues. It has<br>
been discovered that the use of non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clots can be used to deliver a<br>

Smith etal., 2000<br>
substance into a subject. The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot functions as a delivery<br>
vehicle for the substance into the subject.<br>
According to one aspect, the invention is a method of delivering a substance to a<br>
subject. The method comprises administering to a subject a non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell<br>
clot containing a substance to deliver the substance to the subject.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention is a method of preparing a non-polymeric<br>
hematopoeitic cell clot substance delivery system. This method comprises adding a substance<br>
to a sample of hematopoeitic cells and allowing the sample of hematopoeitic cells containing<br>
the substance to form a non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the invention is a substance delivery system<br>
comprising a non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot having a substance incorporated therein.<br>
The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot may comprise bone marrow ceils, blood<br>
cells or any other type of cell that would form a clot. The substance may comprise a gene<br>
transfer vehicle, additional cells, such as genetically engineered cells or naive cells, proteins,<br>
such as recombinant or soluble proteins, bioactive molecules or any other type of substance<br>
that could affect a subject.<br>
The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot maybe delivered into any type of tissue.<br>
For instance, in some embodiments the tissue is bone, soft tissues, cartilage, ligaments,<br>
tendons, meniscuses, and invertebral disks or any other region of the body.<br>
The shape and size of the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell, clot in some embodiments<br>
may be determined by a vessel. The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot may be<br>
homogenized with the substance. In other embodiments the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell<br>
clot may be genetically modified to express at least one of growth factors and other gene<br>
products that facilitate tissue repair.<br>
The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot in other embodiments may have a volume<br>
that is determined by the size of a tissue to be repaired.<br>
In yet other embodiments the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot can be collected<br>
from a subject. The bone mass cells may in other embodiments be harvested from iliac crests,<br>
from osteochondral defects that expose underlying bone marrow or any other area of a subject<br>
from which bone marrow cells could be harvested.<br>
The substrate may optionally be in the form of a solution.<br>
The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot containing the substance may be titrated.<br>
The titration may be performed using a pipette.<br>
In some embodiments the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot is mixed with a<br>
suspension of at least one naÏve and genetically modified cells, forming a cell suspension. The<br>
cell suspension may contain additional gene vectors or no additional gene vectors.<br>
In other embodiments the delivery may be a slow, localized release of the substance<br>
from the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot. The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot<br>
may be shaped in a way to allow an effective delivery of the substance. The substance delivery<br>
system may result in the regeneration of tissue in the area of substance delivery.<br>
The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot may, in some embodiments be produced<br>
from a sample of hematopoeitic cells that is allowed to clot for 15-30 minutes, at room<br>
temperature or when placed in a vessel. The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot may then<br>
be harvested from the vessel.<br>
The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot also may be produced from a sample of<br>
hematopoeitic cells which is washed in a phosphate buffer saline. Any unbound substance can<br>
be removed from the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot.<br>
According to other embodiments the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot can be<br>
implanted into a subject. The substance may be delivered into the subject. The delivery may<br>
be a slow, localized release of the substance from the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot.<br>
Optionally, the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot delivery system can be used to<br>
regenerate tissue.<br>
The sample of hematopoeitic cells may be collected from a subject or may be obtained<br>
from another source of hematopoietic cells. The subject may be the same or a different subject<br>
into which the clot is later implanted.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
According to the present invention, it was discovered that a substance could be<br>
delivered to a subject by administering to the subject a non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot<br>
containing the substance. Prior art methods for delivering a substance to a subject, have many<br>
limitations. For instance, some of them are expensive, complex and rarely have desired<br>
sustained and uniform releases.<br>
As used herein a "hematopoeitic cell clot" is a clot comprising any type of<br>
hematopoeitic cell that can form a clot under various conditions. Examples are blood clots and<br>
bone marrow clots. Aspirates of bone marrow or blood can easily be obtained from a subject<br>
using minimally invasive procedures. This is in contrast to the manufacture of artificial<br>
matrices which is much more time-consuming, expensive and labor intensive. To generate<br>
blood clots, a volume of blood cells determined by the size of the defect, can be collected from<br>
a subject by a blood draw. Similarly, to generate bone marrow clots a suitable volume of bone<br>
marrow aspirates can be harvested from sources rich in bone marrow such as the iliac crests,<br>
from osteochondral defects that expose the underlying bone marrow or other appropriate sites.<br>
Bone marrow aspirates and blood generally are of the same consistency and have similar<br>
coagulation properties.<br>
The use of bone marrow or blood clots in tissue repair offers the advantage that the<br>
formation of blood clots and the migration of bone marrow ceils are part of the natural repair<br>
response following generation of osteochondral defects, bone, tendon, meniscus or<br>
intervertebral disk defects. In addition, bone marrow clots are enriched with stem cells, which<br>
retain the capacity to form the different tissues of the body; hence, trie clot represents the<br>
natural microenvironment for a repair response. If coupled with the appropriate biological<br>
agents, the hematopoeitic clot has the potential to promote repair of several tissue types.<br>
The hematopoeitic cell may be isolated from the same subject into whom the clot will<br>
be delivered, from another subject into whom the substance will not be delivered, from a lab<br>
sample grown in vitro or from any other source of hematopoeitic cells. Clearly, different<br>
situations and substances would favor different sources from which the hematopoeitic cell clot<br>
would be taken. For example, if the hematopoeitic cell clot is obtained from the same subject<br>
into which the substance will be delivered, the clot is completely natural and autologous to the<br>
subject. Therefore, the hematopoeitic cells are less likely to interfere with the substance<br>
delivery, inhibit the substance"s desired effect or produce an immune response.<br>
The hematopoeitic cell clot can have any size and shape. For instance, the<br>
hematopoeitic cell clot may be used in whatever form it naturally takes during the clotting<br>
process. Alternatively steps may be taken to form the hematopoeitic cell clot into a specific<br>
size or shape. A hematopoeitic cell clot of a specific size or shape may be useful for repair of a<br>
specific tissue defect. In that case it may be desirable to produce a clot having a size similar to<br>
the particular defect being corrected or treated.<br>
One method for preparing a hematopoeitic cell clot in a specific size or shape is to use a<br>
molding vessel. For instance, the hematopoeitic cell clot can be formed in a vessel; so that the<br>
sample of hematopoeitic cells and substance mixture will solidify in the vessel. In such a<br>
manner, the clot will have a size and shape which is determined by the vessel"s size and shape.<br>
The hematopoeitic cell clot may also be shaped in a way to allow effective delivery of a<br>
substance, such as a drug, i.e. even in the absence of a tissue defect. The solid state of the<br>
hematopoeitic cell clot allows the clot to be easily handled and implanted at sites of damage.<br>
As mentioned above, the hematopoeitic cell clot may be useful for the repair of<br>
defective tissue. The clot can be placed into the tissue to help in the healing process.<br>
Preferably a substance that is also helpful in the repair process is incorporated into the clot. It<br>
is possible in some instances that the clot may be used alone to simply provide a matrix for<br>
ingrowth of cells during the repair process, but preferably a substance, such as a cell, drug or<br>
gene vector, is incorporated therein. The defective tissue may be any tissue in need of repair.<br>
For instance the tissue may be bone and various soft tissues, including but not limited to<br>
cartilage, ligaments, tendons, meniscuses and intervertebral disks. Alternatively, the<br>
hematopoeitic cell clot can be used as an in vitro system to engineer or repair tissues for<br>
subsequent implantation. For in vitro tissue formation, the hematopoeitic cell clots can be<br>
seeded with the cells, and cultured in the appropriate media.<br>
The hematopoeitic cell clot may also be used to deliver drugs or cells to a subject in the<br>
absence of any tissue to be repaired. For instance the clot may be used as any other sustained<br>
release device is used to deliver a compound to a subject. The specific uses will depend on the<br>
type of drug, cell or gene vector being delivered to the subject.<br>
As used herein a "subject" is a vertebrate such as a human, non-human primate, cow,<br>
horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat, or rodent.<br>
The formation of the hematopoeitic cell clot can occur under various conditions, such<br>
as at room temperature. For example, the coagulation of rabbit or human blood and bone<br>
marrow aspirate will occur within approximately 15-30 minutes. This clot may therefore be<br>
generated and implanted intra-operatively, if it is so desired.<br>
Once the hematopoeitic cell clot has formed, any unbound substance may be removed<br>
from the clot. For example, the hematopoeitic cell clot could be washed in a solution such as a<br>
phosphate buffer saline. Examples of more detailed methods for preparing the clots are set<br>
forth in the description of experiments presented below. Those of ordinary skill in the art are<br>
aware of other methods for preparing clots with hematopoeitic cells.<br>
As used herein a "non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot" is a hematopoetic cell clot, as<br>
defined above, wherein a polymer matrix is not incorporated into the clot or used as the<br>
structure for the clot. Most drug-delivery devices for tissue repairs use a polymer matrix as a<br>
structure for delivering the drug. A polymer matrix is formed from polymers, such as modified<br>
or natural polysaccharides, such as chitosan, chitin, hyaluronan, glycosaminoglycan,<br>
chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin, or heparin sulfate. A polymer<br>
may be a natural, recombinant or synthetic protein, such as soluble collagen or soluble gelatin,<br>
or a polyamino acids, such as for example a polylysine. A polymer may also be polylactic<br>
acid, polyglycolic acid, a synthetic homo and block copolyrners containing carboxylic, amino,<br>
sulfonic, phosphonic, phosphenic functionalities with or without additional functionalities such<br>
as for example without limitation hydroxyl, thiol, alkoxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, and aroyloxy.<br>
Additionally, a polyrcier may comprise orthoesters, anhydrides, propylene-co-fumarates, or a<br>
polymer of one or more alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid monomers, (e.g. alpha-hydroxy acetic<br>
acid (glycolic acid) and/or alpha-hydroxy propionic acid (lactic acid)).<br>
A polymer may be initially dissolved or suspended in a buffer containing inorganic<br>
salts such as sodium chloride, potassium calcium, magnesium phosphate, sulfate, and<br>
carboxylate. A polymer may also dissolved or suspended in a buffer containing an organic salt<br>
such as glycerol-phosphate, fructose phosphate, glucose phosphate, L-Serfne phosphate,<br>
adenosine phosphate, glucosamine,galactosamine, HEPES, PIPES, and MES.<br>
Preferably a substance is incorporated into the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot. As<br>
used herein a "substance" is any composition that will have an effect on a subject, including a<br>
diagnostic effect. The substance, may be, for example, a cell or any other active agent, e.g. a drug<br>
or a gene vector capable of expressing a peptide, a small molecule, etc. The substance is an<br>
exogenous substance. That is, it is one that is added to the sample of hematopoeitic cells and was<br>
not present in the cell sample before it was taken from its prior environment (i.e. a subject, an in<br>
vitro environment, etc.). Examples of the substance are gene transfer vehicles (viral and non-<br>
viral), additional cells, genetically engineered or naive, recombinant, soluble or any other type of<br>
proteins or other bioactive molecules, such as growth factors.<br>
An active agent as used herein is any compound which has a diagnostic, prophylactic,<br>
or therapeutic effect in a biological organism. Active agents include compounds such as<br>
proteins, peptides, antibodies, polysaccharides, nucleic acids (e.g. RNA, DNA, PNA,<br>
multiplexes of them (e.g. triplex)), saccharides, glycoproteins, amino acids, viruses,<br>
heterogeneous mixtures of macromolecules (e.g. a natural product extract) and hybrid<br>
macromolecules (e.g. protein/nucleic acid hybrids, albumin conjugated proteins, drugs with<br>
linkers inorganic molecules, organic molecules, or combinations thereof).<br>
A bioactive agent is any compound which has a prophylactic or therapeutic effect in a<br>
biological organism. In some embodiments the bioactive agent is any of the following agents:<br>

One preferred use of the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot is to repair bone and tissue<br>
defects. Proteins that are most likely linked to cartilage, bones and soft tissue repair are the<br>
members of the transforming growth factor - b (TGF-b) super family including TGF-b S 1-3,<br>
various bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), fibroblast growth factors, growth hormone, and<br>
insulin-like growth factors (IGFs).<br>
The in vivo administration of recombinant proteins to enhance the formation of cartilage<br>
and cartilage repair as well as that of bone and soft tissue has been investigated in various defect<br>
models and experimental animals.2 Despite promising results, the clinical application of<br>
recombinant proteins is hindered by the short biological half lives of these molecules and lack of<br>
an effective method for sustained, target delivery. Direct injection of protein growth factors into<br>
2 Hunziker, 2001; Nixon et al., 1999; Sellers et al., 1997<br>
sites of tissue damage has led to disappointing results because the factors are diluted by body<br>
fluids, quickly metabolized or disseminated to other tissues. Thus, the maintenance of therapeutic<br>
concentrations requires very high loading doses or repeat administration. This decreases the<br>
efficiency of repair, while increasing the costs, complexity, and risk of generating unwanted side<br>
effects from exposure of non-target organs. The non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clots described<br>
herein overcome many of these problems, as demonstrated in the examples presented below.<br>
The clot is also useful for delivering genes to a subject, generally or to a specific tissue<br>
of a subject. As used herein, a "gene" is an isolated nucleic acid molecule of greater than thirty<br>
nucleotides, more typically one hundred nucleotides or more, in length. It generally will be<br>
under the control of an appropriate promoter, which may be inducible, repressible, or<br>
constitutive. Any genes that would be useful in replacing or supplementing a desired function,<br>
or achieving a desired effect such as the inhibition of tumor growth, could be introduced using<br>
the clots described herein. "Promoters can be general promoters, yielding expression in a<br>
variety of mammalian cells, or cell specific, or even nuclear versus cytoplasmic specific.<br>
These are known to those skilled in the art and can be constructed using standard molecular<br>
biology protocols.<br>
Any type of gene is useful according to the methods of the invention. The specific<br>
genes used in a particular circumstance will depend on the condition being treated and/or the<br>
desired therapeutic result. An exemplary list of genes that have been used in gene therapy is<br>
provided in Figure 1. In some embodiments of the invention, any one or combination of the<br>
genes listed in Figure I may be incorporated into the delivery device of the invention.<br>
Gene transfer offers an approach that may overcome the many limitations of protein<br>
delivery to damaged tissues. The invention described in this disclosure presents a novel<br>
system for the application of gene delivery vehicles, cells and soluble proteins for the healing<br>
of damaged tissues. By delivering the cDNAs that code for proteins with reparative or<br>
therapeutic potential to specific cells at sites of injury or disease, the genetically-modified cells<br>
become local factors for drug production, permitting sustained synthesis of fee specific protein.<br>
Suitable promoters, enhancers, vectors, etc., for such genes are published in the<br>
literature. In general, useful genes replace or supplement function, including genes encoding<br>
missing enzymes such as adenosine deaminase (ADA) which has been used in clinical trials to<br>
treat ADA deficiency and cofactors such as insulin and coagulation factor VIII. Genes which<br>
affect regulation can also be administered, alone or in combination with a gene supplementing<br>
or replacing a specific function. For example, a gene encoding a protein which suppresses<br>
expression of a particular protein-encoding gene can be administered by the clots of the<br>
invention. Genes can be obtained or derived from a variety of sources, including literature<br>
references, Genbank, or commercial suppliers. They can be synthesized using solid phase<br>
synthesis if relatively small, obtained from deposited samples such as those deposited with the<br>
American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD or isolated de novo using published<br>
sequence information.<br>
In addition to genes, the substance may be a short oligonucleotides such as antisense<br>
and ribozymes which are distinguished from genes by their length and function. Unlike such<br>
short oligonucleotides, genes encode protein and therefore will typically be a minimum of<br>
greater than 100 base pairs in length, more typically in the hundreds of base pairs.<br>
As used herein, vectors are agents that transport the gene into a cell without<br>
degradation and include a promoter yielding expression of the gene in the cells into which it is<br>
delivered.<br>
It will also be recognized that the genes in expression vectors may be transfected into<br>
host cells and cell lines, e.g., prokaryotic (e.g. E. coli), or eukaryotic (e.g. dendritic cells, B<br>
cells, CHO cells, COS cells, yeast expression systems and recombinant baculovirus expression<br>
in insect cells) in vitro. These cells may then be incorporated into the clots. Especially useful<br>
are mammalian cells such as human, mouse, hamster, pig, goat, primate, etc. They may be of a<br>
wide variety of tissue types, and include primary cells and cell lines. Specific examples<br>
include keratinocytes, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow stem cells and embryonic<br>
stem cells. The expression vectors require that the pertinent gene sequence be operably linked<br>
to a promoter.<br>
In some embodiments, a virus vector for delivering a gene is selected from the group<br>
consisting of adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, poxviruses including vaccinia viruses<br>
and attenuated poxviruses, Semliki Forest virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus,<br>
retroviruses, Sindbis virus, and Ty virus-like particle. Examples of viruses and virus-like<br>
particles which have been used to deliver exogenous nucleic acids include: replication-<br>
defective adenoviruses (e.g. Xiang et al., Virology 219:220-227, 1996; Eloit et a.l, J. Virol.<br>
7:5375-5381,1997; Chengalvala et ah, Vaccine 15:335-339,1997), a modified retrovirus<br>
(Townsend et ah, J. Virol. 71:3365-3374,1997), a nonreplicating retrovirus (Irwin et ah, J.<br>
Virol. 68:5036-5044,1994), a replication defective Semliki Forest virus (Zhao et ah, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:3009-3013,1995), canarypox virus and highly attenuated vaccinia<br>
virus derivative (Paoletti, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 93:11349-11353,1996), non-replicative<br>
vaccinia virus (Moss, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 93:11341-11348,1996), replicative vaccinia<br>
virus (Moss, Dev. Biol Stand. 82:55-63,1994), Venzuelan equine encephalitis virus (Davis et<br>
al, J. Virol. 70:3781-3787,1996), Sindbis virus (Pugachev et al., Virology 212:587-594,<br>
1995), and Ty virus-like particle (Allsopp et al., Eur. J. Immunol 26:1951-1959,1996). In<br>
preferred embodiments, the virus vector is an adenovirus or an alphavirus.<br>
Another preferred virus for certain applications is the adeno-associated virus, a double-<br>
stranded DNA virus. The adeno-associated virus is capable of infecting a wide range of cell<br>
types and species and can be engineered to be replication-deficient. It further has advantages,<br>
such as heat and lipid solvent stability, high transduction frequencies in cells of diverse<br>
lineages, including hematopoietic cells, and lack of superinfection inhibition thus allowing<br>
multiple series of transductions. The adeno-associated virus can integrate into human cellular<br>
DNA in a site-specific manner, thereby minimizing the possibility of insertional mutagenesis<br>
and variability of inserted gene expression. In addition, wild-type adeno-associated virus<br>
infections have been followed in tissue culture for greater than 100 passages in the absence of<br>
selective pressure, implying that the adeno-associated virus genomic integration is a relatively<br>
stable event. The adeno-associated virus can also function in an extrachromosomal fashion.<br>
hi general, other preferred viral vectors are based on non-cytopathic eukaryotic viruses<br>
in which non-essential genes have been replaced with the gene of interest. Non-cytopathic<br>
viruses include retroviruses, the life cycle of which involves reverse transcription of genomic<br>
viral RNA into DNA with subsequent proviral integration into host cellular DNA.<br>
Adenoviruses and retroviruses have been approved for human gene therapy trials. In general,<br>
the retroviruses are replication-deficient (i.e. capable of directing synthesis of the desired<br>
proteins, but incapable of manufacturing an infectious particle). Such genetically altered<br>
retroviral expression vectors have general utility for the high-efficiency transduction of genes<br>
in vivo. Standard protocols for producing replication-deficient retroviruses (including the steps<br>
of incorporation of exogenous genetic material into a plasmid, transfection of a packaging cell<br>
line with plasmid, production of recombinant retroviruses by the packaging cell line, collection<br>
of viral particles from tissue culture media, and infection of the target cells with viral particles)<br>
are provided in Kriegler, M., "Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual," W.H.<br>

Preferably the foregoing nucleic acid delivery vectors: (1) contain exogenous genetic<br>
material that can be transcribed and translated in a mammalian cell, and (2) optionally may<br>
contain on a surface a ligand that selectively binds to a receptor on the surface of a target cell,<br>
such as a mammalian cell, and thereby gains entry to the target cell.<br>
Various techniques may be employed for introducing nucleic acids of the invention into<br>
cells, depending on whether the nucleic acids are introduced in vitro or in vivo in a host. Such<br>
techniques include transfection of nucleic acid-CaPO4 precipitates, transfection of nucleic<br>
acids associated with DEAE, transfection or infection with the foregoing viruses including the<br>
nucleic acid of interest, liposome mediated transfection, and the like. For certain uses, it may<br>
be preferred to target the nucleic acid to particular cells, especially if the clot will be implanted<br>
or administered at a distant site from the target cell. In such instances, a vehicle used for<br>
delivering a nucleic acid of the invention into a ceil (e.g. a retrovirus, or other virus; a<br>
liposome) after release from the clot can have a targeting molecule attached thereto. For<br>
example, a molecule such as an antibody specific for a surface membrane protein on the target<br>
cell or a ligand for a receptor on the target cell can be bound to or incorporated within the<br>
nucleic acid delivery vehicle. Where liposomes are employed to deliver the genes, proteins<br>
which bind to a surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be incorporated<br>
into the liposome formulation for targeting and/or to facilitate uptake. Such proteins include<br>
capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type, antibodies for proteins<br>
which undergo internalization in cycling, proteins that target intracellular localization and<br>
enhance intracellular half life, and the like.<br>
The substance may be in any state, such as a solution, solid, vector, gas or any other state<br>
that would enable the substance to mix with the hematopoeitic cell to form a clot.<br>
For direct gene transfer, the harvested blood or bone marrow can be added to a solution<br>
containing a gene transfer vector (viral or non-viral) or a protein in an appropriately sized and<br>
shaped vessel or in any vessel that would allow the cell sample to mix with the substance. This<br>
mixture can be titrated using a pipette or any other device or system that would mix the<br>
substance with the cell sample.<br>
For an ex vivo gene delivery approach, the hematopoeitic cell, e.g., blood or bone<br>
marrow aspirate can be mixed with a suspension of naive or genetically modified cells with or<br>
without an additional vector. The cells are then incorporated into the clot and returned to the<br>
body.<br>
The invention also encompasses products. The products are substance delivery<br>
systems. As used herein a "substance delivery system" is a non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell<br>
clot containing a substance such that the non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot can deliver the<br>
substance to a subject.<br>
When administered, the compositions (non-polymeric hematopoeitic cell clot<br>
containing the substance) can be administered in pharmaceutically acceptable preparations.<br>
Such preparations may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt,<br>
buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers and optionally other non-incorporated<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
The compositions can be administered by any conventional route, including injection or<br>
by gradual infusion over time. The administration may, for example, be direct injection or<br>
implantation, oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, intrapulmonary,<br>
mucosal (i.e. rectal, vaginal, ocular, dermal, intranasal, etc.), subcutaneous, aerosol, or<br>
transdermal. The administration may be systemic or local.<br>
The compositions of the invention are administered in effective amounts. An "effective<br>
amount" is that amount of a composition that alone, or together with further doses, produces<br>
the desired response. The desired response, of course, will depend on the particular condition<br>
being treated and the type of cell or active agent being administered within the clot. These<br>
factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more<br>
than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum dose of the individual<br>
components or combinations thereof be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound<br>
medical judgment. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, however, that a<br>
patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons, psychological<br>
reasons or for virtually any other reasons. The compositions used in the foregoing methods<br>
preferably are sterile and contain an effective amount of the substance for producing the<br>
desired response in a unit of weight or volume suitable for administration to a patient.<br>
When administered, the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are applied in<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable amounts and in pharmaceutically-acceptable compositions. The<br>
term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a non-toxic material that does not interfere withthe<br>
effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients. Such preparations may<br>
routinely contain salts, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally<br>
other therapeutic agents. When used in medicine, the salts should be pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the scope of the invention.<br>
Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include, but are not limited to,<br>
those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric,<br>
phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, citric, formic, malonic, succinic, and the like. Also,<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such<br>
as sodium, potassium or calcium salts.<br>
Examples<br>
In Vitro:<br>
Example 1: Loading capacity of blood or bone marrow clots<br>
To evaluate the maximum amount of fluid that can be added to human blood without<br>
disrupting the clotting process, a 200 ml of volume of blood was mixed with increasing<br>
amounts of PBS. Clotting still occurred after adding a volume of PBS almost twice that of<br>
blood. As shown in Fig. 2, this finding was compared to the amount of fluid a collagen-<br>
glycosaminoglycan-matrix (collagen-gag-matrix) of the same size was able to absorb. No<br>
significant difference in the uptake of fluid between clots and collagen-gag-matrix was<br>
observed.<br>
To determine whether a human blood clot is able to incorporate cells, rabbit bone<br>
marrow cells were cultured in monolayer and infected with an adenovirus vector carrying a<br>
gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). After 24h, approximately 600,000 fluorescent<br>
cells were trypsinized and recovered by centrifugation. The cell pellets were each resuspended<br>
in 450 ml of human blood. These blood-cell constructs were then clotted in microcentrifuge<br>
tubes. After 1 hthe clots were harvested, immersed in 1 ml of PBS and cultured for 24h in<br>
Ham"s F12 medium, each in a 12 well plate.<br>
The human blood clots showed a high density of green fluorescent rabbit bone marrow<br>
cells 24 h after clotting, as can be seen in Fig. 3. Analysis of the remaining fluid in the<br>
Eppendorf tubes after clotting revealed no residual green cells, indicating that all of the<br>
transduced rabbit bone marrow cells had been retained by the human blood clots.<br>
Example 2: Form of the clot<br>
Experiments using different vessels for clotting, confirmed that clots could be formed<br>
into a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Clots thus generated remained stable enough to be<br>
implanted in any size and shape of defect, an example of which is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Example 3: Seeding of blood clots and bone marrow clots with genetically<br>
modified cells (to simulate an ex vivo gene delivery approach)<br>
To simulate an ex vivo gene delivery approach, 4 groups of rabbit blood clots were<br>
examined in vitro:<br>
\. 450 ml rabbit blood only<br>
2. 450 ml rabbit blood mixed with a suspension of 400,000 rabbit bone<br>
marrow cells<br>
3. 450 ml rabbit blood mixed with a suspension of 400,000 rabbit bone<br>
marrow cells genetically modified with recombinant adenovirus to<br>
express GFP<br>
4. 450 ml rabbit blood mixed with a suspension of 400,000 rabbit bone<br>
marrow cells genetically modified with recombinant adenovirus to<br>
express TGF-b<br>
Each group contained 4 replicates. Clots were examined by fluorescent microscopy at<br>
days 1,3,7,14, and 21. TGF-b expression was determined in clots seeded with cells transduced<br>
to express TGF-b by measuring TGF-b levels in the media using ELISA.<br>
Fluorescent cells within clots were observed for at least 21 days in vitro. Fig. 5a shows<br>
the cells at day 1 and Fig. 5b shows the cells after 21 days. Similarly TGF-b expression was<br>
observed for at least 21 days with maximum expression at day seven; the results are shown in<br>
Fig. 6.<br>
Example 4: Direct transduction of cells within blood clots and bone marrow clots<br>
(to simulate the direct gene delivery approach)<br>
To determine if cells within blood clots or bone marrow clots can support transgene<br>
expression, blood and bone marrow were mixed with the adenoviral vectors, Ad TGF-p and<br>
Ad GFP.<br>
1. 450 ml rabbit blood only<br>
2. 450 ml rabbit blood and 10 µl Ad GFP<br>
3. 450 µl rabbit blood and 10 µl Ad TGF-b<br>
4. 450 µl rabbit bone marrow-aspirate only<br>
5. 450 µl rabbit bone marrow-aspirate and 10µl Ad GFP<br>
6. 450 µl rabbit bone marrow-aspirate and 10 µl Ad TGF-b<br>
Each group consisted of 4 replicates. Clots were formed as described previously and<br>
were examined microscopically at day 1,3,7,14, and 21. ELISA of the conditioned media was<br>
performed at the same time points to measure TGF-b expression.<br>
GFP expression was observed within blood clots and bone marrow clots for up to 14<br>
days, the results of which can be seen in Fig. 7.<br>
TGF-b production was detected for up to 7 days in bone marrow clots, with the<br>
maximum at day 3 and decreasing to background levels by day 14.<br>
In contrast, detectable levels of TGF-b were not expressed in blood clots infected with<br>
Ad TGF-b. The absence of secreted TGF-b in the media may be due to the growth factor<br>
becoming trapped in the clot, or some other distinction with the vector.<br>
A further experiment to quantify these transgene products remaining trapped in the<br>
blood clots was performed using the same procedure, the results of which can be seen in Fig. 8.<br>
1. Rabbit blood (450 µl)<br>
2. Rabbit bone marrow (450µl)<br>
3. Rabbit blood (450 µl) and Ad TGF-b (10µl)<br>
4. Rabbit bone marrow (450µl) and TGF-b(10 µl)<br>
On the second day of culture, clots were harvested, washed in PBS, disaggregated<br>
mechanically, and cultured in Ham"s F12 medium. TGF-P levels were assayed on days 3, 7,<br>
14,21.<br>
TGF-b levels in the blood and bone marrow clots were high 3 days following gene<br>
delivery, but fell to very low levels by day 7. However, bone marrow clots showed a six fold<br>
higher total expression of TGF-b compared to blood clots which is likely due to their higher<br>
cellularity. As such the use of bone marrow seems to be more efficient for expression of<br>
transgene products following direct gene delivery than blood.<br>
Example 5: Stability of adenovirus in blood clots and bone marrow clots<br>
A further study was performed to determine if infectious viral vectors could be retained<br>
and remain transducing within clots, the results of which can be seen in Fig. 9.<br>
Blood clots and bone marrow clots were infected with Ad GFP and cultured as<br>
described above. At various tune points the clots were mechanically disaggregated and<br>
centrifuged to remove cell debris. The supernatants were collected and used to infect<br>
monolayer cultures of 293 cells. After 24 hours the cells were analyzed for fluorescence.<br>
Fluorescent cells were indeed present in cultures that had been infected with the<br>
supernatants from broken up clots from days 1, 3, and 7.<br>
This finding demonstrated the viral vector, Ad GFP, trapped in the clots, was able to<br>
retain its infectivity for at least 7 days in culture.<br>
In Vivo:<br>
Example 6: The use of autologous blood clots and bone marrow clots for direct<br>
gene delivery to cartilage defects in the knees of rabbits<br>
For this objective, adenoviral gene delivery vectors encoding the genes for luciferase,<br>
GFP, and/or Lac Z were mixed and clotted with blood or bone marrow aspirate obtained<br>
from New Zealand white rabbits. After clotting (approximately 30 minutes) blood or bone<br>
marrow-vector constructs were implanted into surgically generated osteochondral defects in<br>
the femoral condyles of the same rabbits. Following implantation, the joint capsule was<br>
sutured and the animals revived. After day 3 the rabbits were sacrificed and the clots were<br>
harvested from the defects. For quantitative analyses, luciferase activity in the clot was<br>
determined. For qualitative analyses, fluorescent cells were viewed microscopically. The<br>
adjacent synovium was also examined for expression of the transgenes.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10 high levels of luciferase transgene expression were observed in the<br>
harvested blood clots and bone marrow clots that had been mixed with Ad Luciferase.<br>
Similarly, large numbers of fluorescent cells were observed in the harvested clots that were<br>
infected with Ad GFP. A few green cells were also observed in the synovia! lining<br>
immediately adjacent to the defect site. However, no expression was observed in other areas<br>
of the synovium. These results were in contrast to a highly green fluorescent synovial lining<br>
that is observed following direct gene delivery of a collagen-gag matrix containing Ad GFP to<br>
osteochondral defects. Thus, blood and bone marrow clots provide more contained localized<br>
transgene expression when implanted in vivo.<br>
Example 7: The potential for chondrogenesis or osteogenesis using rabbit blood<br>
clots and bone marrow clots<br>
This study investigates the ability of endogenous precursor cells to change phenotype<br>
and undergo chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation within blood and bone marrow clots.<br>
For this, blood and bone marrow were harvested from New Zealand white rabbits and clotted<br>
for "a total" of 6 groups:<br>
1. Rabbit blood (450µl) (1 clot)<br>
2. Rabbit blood (450 µl) and Ad GFP (10 µl) (3 clots)<br>
3. Rabbit blood (450 ml) and Ad TGF-b (10µl) (4 clots)<br>
4. Rabbit bone marrow (450 µl) (1 clot)<br>
5. Rabbit bone marrow (450 µl) and GFP (10µl) (5 clots)<br>
6. Rabbit bone marrow (450 µl) and TGF-b(10µl) (3 clots)<br>
The clots were cultured in Ham"s F12 medium for 6 weeks. After harvesting they were<br>
fixed, paraffin embedded, sectioned and examined for histology. The sections were stained<br>
with Hematoxylin-Eosin and Gomori"s Trichrome Kit (Collagen Blue Staining). Sections<br>
were examined by three different individuals in a blinded manner.<br>
In bone marrow clots that were not genetically modified with growth factors (bone<br>
marrow only and bone marrow mixed with Ad GFP), the pluripotent nature of the endogenous<br>
cells was apparent. Areas of muscle-like, fat-like and fibrous tissue were found in all of these<br>
clots after 6 weeks, as depicted in Fig. 11. Bone marrow clots enriched with Ad TGF-P<br>
showed a more homogenous differentiation, with no muscle-like tissue seen. Instead, more<br>
fibrous tissue was observed, as depicted in Fig. 12.<br>
Cell differentiation was not evident in blood clots. However, different concentrations<br>
and combinations of vectors may result in differentiation. These results suggest that cells<br>
within bone marrow clots are multi-potential, with the capacity to differentiate into many tissue<br>
types.<br>
Because adenoviral vectors are powerful tools for studying the effects of over-<br>
expression of gene products, they were the vector of choice in the experiments described here.<br>
However, it is expected that other gene transfer vectors, such as Adeno Associated Virus<br>
(AAV) and retroviral vectors may have even greater clinical utility than vectors derived from<br>
adenoviruses.<br>
Example 8: The use of bone marrow clots modified with Ad.TGF-b1 for repairing<br>
cartilaginous tissue<br>
This study investigates the use of bone marrow clots in repairing cartilaginous tissue.<br>
An osteochondral defect was created by drilling 3mm wide and 8mm deep holes through the<br>
cartilage and into the bone and marrow of rabbit knees. Control defects were either left<br>
untreated (empty defect) or received an unmodified bone marrow clot. A bone marrow ciot,<br>
which was pre-infected with adenovirus containing the gene for transforming growth factor<br>
beta-1 (TGF-b1), was implanted into the remaining osteochondral defects.<br>
Slides were taken six weeks after surgery and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E)<br>
and toluidine blue. H&amp;E is a common acid-base histologic stain; toluidiae blue acts as an<br>
indicator of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).<br>
In the control defect that was left untreated, a fibrous repair formed that did not<br>
resemble the flanking cartilage. The other control defect that was treated with the unmodified<br>
bone marrow clot implant shows only a bony surface and no GAGs.<br>
The defect that was treated with the pre-infected bone marrow clot that contained TGF-<br>
b1, had a chondrogenic appearance, showing a robust extracellular matrix. In most of the<br>
repair, the repair matrix was stained dark blue, indicating GAGs were present. The cells within<br>
the repair matrix resemble chondrocytes morphologically, but appear in clusters. Underneath<br>
the cartilage repair tissue was robust bone formation. Also, the cartilage layer was about the<br>
same depth as the flanking tissue.<br>
These results suggest that although the repair tissue is not perfect, using this approach<br>
to gene delivery, the biology of the cells within a coagulated bone marrow aspirate can be<br>
influenced in a positive direction.<br>
