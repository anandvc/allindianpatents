This  Invention relates to an oven.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an oven having good conbustion efficiency acceptably free from pollution caused by gases emitted froa unburnt or partly burnt fuel.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an oven providing sufficient manual access for easy cleaning and maintenance.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose an oven wherein radiation of heat from the sides and rear of thereof are acceptably low.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an oven wherein the entry of atmospheric air into the zone of combustion and the exit of the gases of conbustion therefrom are maintained as a continuous, naturally occurring, flow, from one end of the oven to the other.<br>
Such of the other objects and resulting advantages of this invention as have not been, hereinabove expressly stated will be apparent from the further description thereof given hereunder.<br><br>
The oven, according to this invention, comprises an air passage having an open top, but closed at its base, rear and sides, except for a first opening at one end and a second narrower opening at the other end thereof; a removable grate supported over the open top of said passage; outwardly diverging members, on either side of the grate, said members, leaving a gap therebetween above the first opening, and enabling a culihary utensil to be received thereon; and heat insulation means provided for minimising peripheral radiation of heat*<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, one of various possible embodiments of the oven proposed herein, wherein<br>
Fig.l illustrates the embodiment in perspective<br>
view<br>
Fig.2 illustrates the embodiment in front view<br>
and Fig.3 illustrates the embodiment in top plan view.<br><br>
The lower portion of the oven is provided with an air passage P open at the top at D, but closed at its base B, rear R and sides S, except for a first opening Ol at one end and a second narrower opening 02 at the other.<br>
A removable grate 6 is disposed over the open top of said passage P. The grate is held in place on supports F, preferably in the form of ledges, provided at the region of the open top of the passage P.<br>
The said upper portion of the oven, adjacent the grate and on either side thereof, is provided with outwardly diverging members N, leaving a gap E therebetween. The gap E is situated above the first opening 01. The opening 02, in the enbodiment Illustrated, will be seen to be located above the level of the members.<br>
A metal plate N (shown in Fig.2) is intended for being placed over, and supported on, the said members M. The plate N is intended for receiving food substances to be cooked. Instead of the plate N other culinary utensils can be supported on   the  said  members M,  such  as, a<br><br>
cauldron, a sauce pan and so on. The plate N is suitable for making doses and the like. The gap E between the members M allows atmospheric air to have access to the space above the grate and below the plate or other culinary utensil.<br>
Known heat insulation means are provided for the upper and lower portions of the oven, to reduce heat radiation. These means can be provided on the outer surfaces of the sides and rear of the passage P and/or on the outer surfaces of the members H, as coatings or layers of heat insulation substances.<br>
It is also possible to have such insulation means provided beneath the outer surfaces of the sides and rear of the passage P and/or beneath the outer surfaces of the members M, such as embedded heat insulation substances provided during manufactureâ€¢<br>
AS stated above, the combustion efficiency is good and therefore less smoke pollution. The air passage P maintains a natural flow of air from atmosphere.  from opening 01 to opening 02. This<br><br>
flow is naturally maintained by the neat developed within the passage wherein fuel e.g. fire wood, is burnt. Good air flow thus maintained aids god combustion. The narrower opening 02 assists in a controlled travel of air and evacuation of combustion gases.<br>
The structure of the oven will also be seen to be such as to provide sufficient manual access for easy cleaning and maintenance. The flame in the passage P rises through the open top and through the perforations in the grate to heat the culinary utensil placed on the members M. The divergent configuration of the members M results in good distribution and dissipation of heat.<br>
The oven will, preferably, be provided with a surrounding framework J, at the sides and rear, to avoid any part of the body of the user coming into contact with any hot part of the oven.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is<br><br>
understood that various other embodiments of the oven proposed herein are possible, without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An oven comprising an air passage having an open top, but closed at its base, rear and sides, except for a first opening at one end and a second narrower opening at the other end thereof; a removable grate supported over the open top of said passage; outwardly diverging members, on either side of the grate, said members, leaving a gap therebetween above the first opening, and enabling a culinary utensil to be received thereon; and heat insulation means provided for minimising peripheral radiation of heat.<br>
2.	An oven as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the second narrower opening is located above the level of the said members.<br>
3.	An oven as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the insulation means are provided on the outer surface of the sides and rear of the said passage.<br>
4.	An oven as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the insulation means are provided beneath the outer surface of the sides<br><br>
and rear of the said passage.<br>
5.	An oven as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the Insulation means are<br>
provided on the outer surface of each of the said<br>
membersâ€¢<br>
6.	An oven as claimed In any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the Insulation means are<br>
provided beneath the outer surface of each of the<br>
said members.<br>
7.	An oven as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein a framework surrounds the<br>
oven at Its sides and rear.<br>
8.	An oven as claimed In any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the grate Is supported on<br>
ledges.<br>
9.	An  oven substantially  as  herein<br>
described with reference to, and as Illustrated In<br><br></td>
