				<td>POWER LEVEL ARBITRATION BETWEEN BASE STATION AND MOBILE STATION IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing from an application entitled STATE TRANSITION METHOD IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM earlier filed in the Korean Industrial Property Office on 25 April 1998, and there duly assigned Serial No. 98-14880.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system, and in particular, to a method for arbitrating a power level between a base station and a mobile station in a CDMA mobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
An existing code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile communication system mainly supports voice service. It is, however, foreseen that mobile communications will be performed in accordance with the IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication-2000) standard in the near future. The IMT 2000 standard provides not only voice service but also high speed packet service. For example, the IMT-2000 standard supports high quality voice service, moving<br><br>
picture service, Internet search service, etc.<br>
In the existing CDMA mobile communication system, after completion of data transmission, a channel used for data transmission is released. Thereafter, when there is a need to restart data transmission, the channel is reconnected in response to a channel request message to transmit the data. However, due to the channel reconnection, the existing system has an increased time delay in providing the packet service as well as the voice service, so that it is difficult to provide a high quality service. Therefore, there is a demand for an improved method capable of providing the packet service as well as the voice service with the reduced time delay. In the packet data service, data is transmitted intermittently. That is, after transmission of the packet data, there occurs a non-transmission interval before transmission of the next packet data. In the non-transmission interval, the existing system releases or maintains the channel; releasing the channel causes a time delay in reconnecting the channel and maintaining the channel results in a waste of the channel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a power control method for transitioning from a state where data is not transmitted to a state where data can be immediately transmitted, in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for transitioning from a slotted substate to a normal substate where a transition to an active state can be readily made.<br>
-2-<br><br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide a method for efficiently controlling transmission power of a base station and a mobile station in a mobile communication system.<br>
To achieve the above object, a mobile communication system according to the present invention controls transmission power of radio links between a base station and a mobile station. The mobile communication system comprises (a) assigning forward and reverse dedicated control channels to the base station and the mobile station, respectively, and controlling transmission power of the forward and reverse dedicated control channels so that the respective channels can receive data; (b) discontinuing the transmission power control, when data to transmit/receive is not generated for a predetermined time; and (C) for power level arbitration, re-controlling the transmission power of the forward and reverse dedicated control channels in a state where the transmission power control is not performed, so as to adjust the transmission power with which the data can be received.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The term "power level arbitration (or transmission power level reestablishment)" as used herein can be defined as follows. If power control is not performed for a long time for the channels assigned between a base station and a mobile station, the base station and the mobile station cannot know an appropriate<br>
-5-<br><br>
transmission power when necessary to restart data transmission. Thus, the communication system adjusts the transmission power of the base station and the mobile station to an appropriate transmission power through a power control process. This transmission power adjustment is referred to as "power level arbitration". Further, the "appropriate transmission power" refers to a transmission power level which enables a normal message reception at a receiver. For example, the power level arbitration is applicable to message transmission over a dedicated control channel in a CDMA mobile communication system.<br>
Indian Patent Application No. 1438/CAL/98<br>
 filed by the applicant of the<br>
invention, discloses a channel structure in which a base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) have their own dedicated control channels. During data communication through a traffic channel, the base station and the mobile station exchanges control signals for the traffic channel using the dedicated traffic channels. However, when the data communication is inactivated for a long while, a transition occurs to a control hold state where the traffic channel is released and only the dedicated control channel is maintained, thereby preventing a waste of the channel resources. Further, when data to be transmitted is generated in this control hold state, the traffic channel is promptly reconnected. Such a control hold state is divided into two substates; a normal substate and a slotted substate. In the normal substate, there is no data to be transmitted, and only the control signals are exchanged via the dedicated control channel. If data to be transmitted is not generated within a predetermined time even in the normal substate, a transition to the lotted substate takes place. In the slotted substate, the dedicated control channel is established but the control signals are not exchanged via the dedicated control channel established, in order to prevent power consumption of the mobile station<br>
-6-<br><br>
due to the continuous exchange of the control signals even though there is no data to transmit. Therefore, for a transition from this slotted substate back to the normal substate, power level arbitration is required between the base station and the mobile<br>
station.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, when a normal power control has not been not performed for a long time because there is no data to be exchanged between the base station and the mobile station, the transmission power is adjusted to a normal power so that a reception party can normally receive a message transmitted from a transmission party. In this case, the power level arbitration is performed prior to a transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate. Furthermore, the normal power control may not be performed for a long while, in the case where there is no data to transmit even though the dedicated control channels are assigned to the base station and the mobile station. Also, in this case, the transmission power is controlled such that the reception party can normally receive the message transmitted from the transmission party.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates respective channels and channel transceivers which are used between the base station and the mobile station after call setup, in a CDMA mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. For simplicity, channels used during the call setup are not illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
In some cases, the functions of the respective channels may be varied. In particular, power control bits (or power control signals) and preamble signals can be transmitted via not only a specific channel but also other channels. However, for<br>
-7-<br><br>
convenience, it is assumed that the power control bits and the preamble signals are transmitted via the specific channel.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, there are shown channel structures for a base station and a mobile station.<br>
First, in the base station, a dedicated control channel generator 10 processes various signaling messages to be transmitted via a forward link dedicated control channel (F-DCCH) and transmits the processed signaling message to the mobile station. A pilot channel generator 12 processes information to be transmitted via a forward link pilot channel (F-PCH) and transmits the processed information to the mobile station. The information transmitted via the forward link pilot channel assists the mobile station with its initial acquisition and channel estimation. A fundamental channel generator 14 processes information to be transmitted via a forward link fundament channel (F-FCH) and transmits the processed information to the mobile station. The information transmitted via the forward link fundamental channel basically includes a voice signal, but can also include various layer 3 signaling messages and power control bits which are used in the IS-95B standard. A supplemental channel generator 16 processes information to be transmitted via a forward link supplemental channel (F-SCH) and transmits the processed information to the mobile station. The information transmitted via the forward link supplemental channel includes RLP (Radio Link Protocol) frames and packet data.<br>
Next, in the mobile station, a dedicated control channel generator 30 processes signaling messages to be transmitted via a reverse link dedicated control channel (R-DCCH) and transmits the processed signaling message to the base<br><br>
station. A pilot channel generator 32 processes information to be transmitted via a reverse link pilot channel (R-PCH) and transmits the processed information to the base station. The information transmitted via the reverse link pilot channel assists the base station with its initial acquisition and channel estimation. Also, a reverse pilot channel signal can carry the power control bits to provide the base station with power control information about the forward channels. Further, in the reverse link, it is possible to transmit the power control bits by inserting them in the pilot channel, without assignment of a separate channel. A fundamental channel generator 34 processes information to be transmitted via a reverse link fundamental channel (R-FCH) and transmits the processed information to the base station. The information transmitted via the reverse link fundamental channel basically includes a voice signal. A supplemental channel generator 36 processes information to be transmitted via a reverse link supplemental channel (R-SCH) and transmits the processed information to the base station. The information transmitted via the reverse link supplemental channel includes RLP frames and packet data.<br>
In the CDMA mobile communication system of FIG. 1, for a packet data communication service, the base station uses the pilot channel, the dedicated control channel and the supplemental channel for the forward link, and the mobile station uses the pilot channel, the dedicated control channel and the supplemental channel for the reverse link. In this case, the base station transmits the power control bits via the forward dedicated control channel and the mobile station transmits the power control bits by inserting them in the reverse pilot channel. In addition, a controller 18, adders 20 and 22, a spreading modulator 24 and a receiver 26 for the base station, and a controller 38, adders 40 and 42, a spreading modulator 44 and a receiver 46 for the mobile station are well described in Korean patent application<br>
-9-<br><br>
11381/1998, filed by the applicant of the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates state transitions of the base station and the mobile station. Since the present invention relates chiefly to the power control in the control hold state, the descriptions will now be made focusing on the control hold state.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, in the control hold state, a traffic channel for the packet data is released because there is no actual data to transmit, and only the dedicated control channel is established to exchange the control signals. As illustrated, the control hold state is divided into the normal substate and the slotted substate. In the normal substate, only the control signals are exchanged via the dedicated control channel. In the slotted substate, the dedicated control channel is established, but the control signal is not exchanged via the dedicated control channel established.<br>
Referring FIGs. 1 and 2, in the control hold state, the base station maintains the pilot channel and the dedicated control channel for the forward link, and the mobile station maintains the pilot channel and the dedicated control channel for the reverse link. In the normal substate, the control signals are exchanged via the dedicated control channel. However, in the slotted substate, although the dedicated control channel is maintained, the control signals are not transmitted via the dedicated control channel. If this state lasts for a long while, the channel condition will be varied with the passage of time. After a while, if a message is transmitted with a previous transmission power, the reception party cannot normally restore the received message.<br>
If data to be transmitted is not generated with a predetermined time in the<br>
-10-<br><br>
normal substate of the control hold state, a transition to the slotted substate takes place. In the slotted substate, although the dedicated control channel is maintained, the control signals are not exchanged, thereby preventing a waste of resources.<br>
An exemplary transition from the normal substate to the slotted substate will be described with reference to FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, a "normal mode" denotes an operation in the normal substate and a "sleep mode" an operation in the slotted substate. Referring to FIG. 3, when the normal substate is maintained for a predetermined time without transmission of control signals or data (i.e., until a corresponding timer expires), the mobile station transmits a sleep request signal (or a transition-to-slotted substate request signal) to the base station via the reverse dedicated control channel (R-DCCH). In the normal substate, the mobile station uses the dedicated control channel and the pilot channel for the reverse link, and the base station uses the dedicated control channel and the pilot channel for the forward link. In this case, since the power control is normally performed, the power level arbitration is not required. Upon receipt of the sleep request signal from the mobile station, the base station transmits a sleep ACK (or a transition-to-slotted substate approval signal) to the mobile station via the forward dedicated control channel (F-DCCH), and then transitions to the slotted substate. Upon receipt of the sleep ACK signal transmitted from the base station, the mobile station transitions to the slotted substate. Upon transitioning to slotted substate, the base station and the mobile station both maintain the forward and reverse dedicated control channels, respectively, but do not exchange control signals via the dedicated control channels. Therefore, the normal power control is not performed.<br>
In some cases, the base station and the mobile station can transition to the<br>
-11 -<br><br>
slotted substate directly using their own internal timers, without the above-stated negotiation for state transition.<br>
When the slotted substate is maintained for a predetermined time or when data to be transmitted is generated in the base station or the mobile station, a transition to the normal substate occurs according to the present invention, which will be described later with reference to FIGs. 4 through 17.<br>
Turning back to FIG. 2, in the active state, the data is exchanged via the traffic channel, while exchanging the control signals via the dedicated control channel. The transition from the control hold state to the active state can be divided into (1) a transition from the normal substate of the control hold state to the active state and (2) a transition from the slotted substate of the control hold state to the active state. In the transition (1), when data to transmit is generated in the normal substate of the control hold state, the base station and the mobile station exchange the control signals via the dedicated control channels to assign the traffic channel for transmitting the data. Upon establishment of the traffic channel, a transition occurs to the active state where the data can be exchanged via the assigned traffic channel. In the transition (2), a transition from the slotted substate of the control hold state to the active state takes place by way of the normal substate. Referring to FIG. 1, in the active state, the base station and the mobile station use the supplemental channels and fundamental channels as well as the pilot channels and the dedicated control channels.<br>
In a suspended state, the dedicated control channel is released and a common channel is used. That is, upon failure to make a transition from the slotted substate<br>
- 12-<br><br>
of the control hold state to the active state within a predetermined time, a transition occurs to the suspended state where the dedicated control channel, which was maintained in the slotted substate, is released and the control signals are transmitted using the common channel. The transition from the slotted substate to the suspended state also occurs through the normal substate of the control hold state. In the suspended state, service information (or service option) between the base station and the mobile station is preserved (or maintained).<br>
A dormant state is equal to the suspended state in that the dedicated control channel is released and the common channel is used. However, in the dormant state, the service option between the base station and the mobile station is no longer preserved.<br>
In a null state, the base station and the mobile station are powered on and wait for data service request to be received from the other party. The null state is a kind of the suspended state. In the active state, the control hold state, the suspended state and the dormant state, initialization information between the base station and the mobile station is maintained. However, in the null state, the initialization information between the base station and the mobile station is not preserved. Upon the transition from the control hold state to the null state, all the information being preserved between the base station and the mobile station is released.<br>
For more detailed description of the respective states and state transitions, see Korean patent application No. 2263/1998 filed by the applicant of the invention.<br>
The present invention proposes an improved method for transitioning from<br>
- 13-<br><br>
the slotted substate of the control hold state to the normal substate. The transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate can take place in the following three methods:<br>
In a first method, a power level is arbitrated at a scheduled time between the base station and the mobile station, regardless of whether there is data to transmit (i.e., scheduled power level arbitration).<br>
In a second method, the power level arbitration is performed for a transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate only when data transmission is required (i.e., unscheduled power level arbitration). This method can be divided again into (1) a case where the power level arbitration is performed for the transition to the normal substate when the mobile station has data to transmit, and (2) a case where the power level arbitration is performed for the transition to the normal substate when the base station has data to transmit.<br>
A third method is a combined method of the first and second methods. In this method, during a periodic or non-periodic power level arbitration process being performed at a scheduled time between the base station and the mobile station, if data transmission is required, power level arbitration is immediately performed for a transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate, regardless of the scheduled time.<br>
The above-stated three methods for the power level arbitration (or power level reestablishment) are shown in FIGs. 4 (4A and 4B), 5 and 6, respectively. More specifically, FIGs. 4A and 4B are given to explain the first method for<br>
- 14-<br><br>
arbitrating the power level at the scheduled time between the base station and the mobile station; FIG. 5 the second method for arbitrating the power level for the transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate only when there is data to transmit in the base station or the mobile station; FIG. 6 the third method where the power level arbitration is immediately performed for the transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate when there is data to transmit, during the scheduled power level arbitration.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 4A and 4B, there are shown distributions of the power level arbitration in the case where the power level arbitration is performed at a scheduled time between the base station and the mobile station. The base station and the mobile station both having information about the scheduled power level arbitration time, simultaneously performs the power level arbitration process at every scheduled power level arbitration time. More specifically, FIG. 4A shows the case where the power level arbitration time is set to be periodic and the power level arbitration is performed at the periodic power level arbitration time; FIG. 4B shows the case where the power level arbitration time is set to be non-periodic and the power level arbitration is performed at the nonperiodic power level artibration time which is known to both the base station and the mobile station. In FIG. 4A, TR denotes a power level arbitration time, and Tn a power level arbitration time interval which is fixed. In FIG. 4B, TR denotes the power level arbitration time, Tl2 a non-power level arbitration time interval being fixed and T13 a power level arbitration time interval being fixed. As illustrated in FIG. 4B, the power level arbitration is performed non-periodically within the interval Tl3, at the power level arbitration time which is known to both the base station and the mobile station. In FIGs. 4A and 4B, upon failure to perform the power level arbitration within the time<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
TR, the power level arbitration is attempted again in the next power level arbitration time interval.<br>
In the case of the scheduled power level arbitration shown in FIGs. 4A and 4B, it is possible to presume a round trip delay (RTD) between the base station and the mobile station, based on the previously performed power level arbitration, thereby reducing a size of a search window for a received signal. Here, the RTD refers to a delay time required in that the base station receives an acknowledge (ACK) signal after transmitting a signal to the mobile station. The reduction in size of the search window reduces the power level arbitration time. However, in the scheduled power level arbitration, when data to transmit is generated in the power level arbitration time interval Tn, it is undesirably necessary to wait until the next power level arbitration time in order to transmit the generated data. In addition, even when the data to transmit is not generated, the power level arbitration is automatically performed at every scheduled power level arbitration time, resulting in a waste of the resources.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a distribution of power level arbitration in the case where the power level arbitration is performed only when the base station or the mobile station have data to transmit (i.e., unscheduled power level arbitration). In this case, the base station or the mobile station, which has data to transmit, initiates the power level arbitration. In FIG. 5, T21, T22, T23 and TR24 denote unfixed power level arbitration time intervals which cannot be expected since the power level arbitration is performed at any time when the base station or the mobile station has data to transmit. In FIG. 5, upon failure to perform the power level arbitration within a predetermined time TR, the power level arbitration is attempted<br>
- 16-<br><br>
again immediately.<br>
In FIG. 5, since the power level arbitration is performed only when necessary to transmit data, it is possible to prevent a waste of the resources. When the power level arbitration is performed after a long sustenance of the slotted substate, it is impossible to presume the RTD between the base station and the mobile station due to a mobility of the mobile station, increasing the size of the search window for the received signal. The increase in the size of the search window causes an increase in the power level arbitration time.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown a distribution of power level arbitration for an improved power level arbitration method combined with the method of FIGs. 4A and 4B and the method of FIG. 5. In this method, while performing the scheduled the power level arbitration, the power level arbitration is performed at any time when there is data to transmit, so as to make a prompt transition to transmit the data. In FIG. 6, (1) upon failure to perform the power level arbitration within the time TR, the power level arbitration is abandoned; (2) when the power level arbitration is periodically performed, the power level arbitration is attempted again upon occurrence of the next power level arbitration; (3) upon failure to perform the power level arbitration within the time TR when the power level arbitration is attempted to transmit data, the power level arbitration is immediately attempted.<br>
As stated above, in FIGs. 4A and 4B, it is possible to presume the RTD while periodically performing the power level arbitration, contributing to a decrease in the power level arbitration time. However, when data to transmit is generated before the<br>

power level arbitration time, it is necessary to wait until the coming power level arbitration time in order to transmit the generated data. In FIG. 5, the power level arbitration is performed only when there is data to transmit, preventing a waste of the resources. However, a long sustenance of the slotted substate increases the power level arbitration time. Accordingly, by combining the method of FIGs. 4A and 4B with the method of FIG. 5, it is possible not only to quickly perform the power level arbitration by the periodic power, level arbitration but also to immediately perform the power level arbitration at any time when data to transmit is generated, so as to make a prompt transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate to transmit the generated data.<br>
FIGs. 7 through 9 are flow diagrams illustrating the power level arbitration processes performed between the base station and the mobile station, corresponding to the methods described in FIGs. 4 (4A and 4B), 5 and 6, respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown the power level arbitration process in the case where the power level arbitration time is scheduled between the base station and the mobile station. In the slotted substate, the base station transmits a power control bit to the mobile station with an appropriate initial power at a time scheduled between the base station and the mobile station to make a transition to the normal substate. At the same time, the mobile station also transmits the power control bit to the base station with an appropriate initial power. In the reverse link, the initial transmission power should be low enough not to affect the system. An initial transmission power, PMS, of the mobile station can be defined as<br>
PMs = (1st constant) - (Total Receiving Power) .... (1)<br>
-18-<br><br>
or<br>
PMS = (2nd constant) - (Rx Power of Pilot Signal from Connected Base Station) ....(2)<br>
In the forward link, a limitation on the initial transmission power of the base station is less serious, as compared with that of the mobile station. For setting the initial transmission power of the base station, there are proposed several methods. In one proposed method, the base station transmits the power control bit with a specific initial power. In another proposed method, the base station transmits the power control bit with its maximum power. The specific initial power can be determined according to a transmission power, PBS, of a pilot signal transmitted from the base station via the forward link pilot channel, as expressed by equation (3). The maximum power of the base station is previously set to a maximum value within the range where the base station does not cause interference to the other cells. When the base station transmits the power control bit with the maximum initial power, the transmission power control of the mobile station will precede that of the base station, reducing an influence on the system.<br>
PBS = (Tx Power of Pilot Signal of Base Station)/(3rd Constant) .... (3)<br>
In equations (1) through (3), the first, second and third constants can be set to optimal values meeting the system capacity by way of experiments.<br>
In FIG. 7, since the power level arbitration is performed at the scheduled time, the base station and the mobile station can know whether the other party transmits the power control bit, although they fail to receive the power control bit<br>
-19-<br><br>
transmitted from the other party. In this case, upon failure to receive the power control bit transmitted from the other party, the base station or the mobile station send a power-up control bit to the other party on the judgement that the transmission power of the other party is lower than a threshold. When the mobile station and the base station both receive the power control bit with an appropriate power, the power level arbitration is completed. Here, if necessary, a prompt transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate can take place. This is because it is possible to transmit a state transition message with a high reliability since the initial transmission power is set to the optimal level. In FIG. 7, when the base station or the mobile station has a message to exchange in the normal substate, a transition to the active state occurs to transmit the message. However, when the base station and the mobile station do not have a message to exchange, a transition to the slotted substate occurs. Here, in the reverse link, the power control bit can be transmitted via the pilot channel; in the forward link, the power control bit can be transmitted via the dedicated control channel.<br>
FIGs. 8 and 9 show the unscheduled power level arbitration methods in which the power level arbitration is performed only when the base station or the mobile station has data to transmit. More specifically, FIG. 8 shows the case where the mobile station initiates the power level arbitration to exchange data, and FIG. 9 shows the case where the base station initiates the power level arbitration to exchange data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, when there is data to exchange in the slotted substate, the mobile station transmits the power control bit with a sufficiently low initial transmission power to the base station, for power level arbitration. The mobile<br>
-20-<br><br>
station increases the transmission power step by step for power level arbitration and transmits the power control bit with the increased power, until the power control bit is received from the base station. Upon receipt of the power control bit in the slotted substate, the base station start to transmit the power control bit with a power controlled according to the received power control bit. In the case where the transmission power of the base station is increased in reverse proportion to the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, the base station transmits a power-down control bit while increasing the transmission power step by step, until the mobile station changes the transmission power of the reverse link according to the power control bit received from the base station. Further, in the case where the base station transmits the power control bit with the initial transmission power regardless of the transmitted power control bit, the base station transmits a power-down control bit with the maximum transmission power, until the mobile station changes the transmission power according to the power control bit received from the base station. Through this procedure, when the mobile station receives the power control bit from the base station, the power level arbitration is completed so that the base station and the mobile station can make a prompt transition from the slotted substate to the normal substate. In some cases, the mobile station may fail to receive the power control bit that the base station has transmitted via the forward link upon receipt of the power control bit from the mobile station. In this case, the mobile station transmits the power control bit with an increased power on the judgement that the base station has failed to receive the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station itself. Although the base station has transmitted a power-down command via the forward link, the mobile station continues to increase the transmission power due to failure to receive the transmitted power-down command, causing a big trouble to the system during this interval. To solve<br>
-21 -<br><br>
this problem, the initial transmission power of the base station is set to the maximum power so that the mobile station can quickly receive the power control bit from the base station, thereby minimizing the interval in trouble. After the transition to the normal substate, the mobile station transitions to the active state to transmit the data to the base station.<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 9, when data to transmit is generated in the slotted substate, the base station transmits a power control bit with an appropriate initial transmission power to the mobile station, for power level arbitration. For the initial transmission power of the base station, refer to the associated description given with reference to FIG. 7. For power level arbitration, the base station increases the transmission power step by step to transmit the power control bit with the increased power until a power control bit is received from the mobile station. In the case where the power control bit received from the base station is a power-up control bit, the mobile station transmits the power control bit by increasing the transmission power step by step if the initial transmission power is set to the sufficiently low power; however, the mobile station continues to transmit the power control bit with the maximum transmission power if the initial transmission power of the base station is set to its maximum transmission power. Upon receipt of the power control bit from the base station in the slotted substate, the mobile station transmits a power control bit to the base station with the initial transmission power according to the received power control bit. The mobile station continuously increases the transmission power until a power-down control bit is received from base station. As the base station receives the power control bit from the mobile station with an appropriate power, the power level arbitration is completed. Then, the base station and the mobile station can make a quick transition from the slotted substate to the<br>
-22-<br><br>
normal substate, because a state transition request message and an acknowledge message can be transmitted with a high reliability after the power level arbitration. After the transition to the normal substate, the base station transitions to the active state to transmit the data to the mobile station.<br>
In FIGs. 7 through 9, the base station and the mobile station exchange the power control bits to perform the power level arbitration. Upon transition to the normal substate after the power level arbitration, it is possible to immediately detect a channel condition. In FIG. 7, the channel condition is detected in the normal substate prior to a transition back to the slotted substate because of non-existence of data to transmit. In FIGs. 8 and 9, the channel condition is detected prior to transmission of the data to be transmitted.<br>
FIGs. 10A through 10C are diagrams illustrating methods for detecting the channel condition after the transition to the normal substate in the manner of FIGs. 7 through 9. There are several methods for detecting the channel condition. In a first method of FIG. 10A, the base station transmits to the mobile station a message (MSG) known to both the base station and the mobile station. In a second method of FIG. 10B, the mobile station transmits to the base station a message known to both the base station and the mobile station. In a third method of FIG. 10C, the base station and the mobile station simultaneously transmit messages known to themselves to each other.<br>
First, referring to FIG. 10A, upon receipt of the message transmitted from the base station, the mobile station transmits an ACK signal; upon receipt of a failed message or upon failure to receive the message transmitted from the base station<br>
-23-<br><br>
within a predetermined time, the mobile station transmits a NACK (negative ACK) signal. Upon receipt of the ACK signal, the base station judges that the forward link and the reverse link are both in a good condition. However, upon receipt of the NACK signal, the base station judges that the forward link is in a bad condition but the reverse link is in a good condition. In addition, upon failure to receive both the ACK signal and the NACK signal, the base station cannot judge which of the two links is in a bad condition. The base station can merely presume that one of the two links or both of them are in a bad condition.<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 10B, upon receipt of the message transmitted from the mobile station, the base station transmits an ACK signal; upon receipt of a failed message or upon failure to receive the message transmitted from the mobile station within a predetermined time, the base station transmits a NACK signal. Upon receipt of the ACK signal, the mobile station judges that the forward link and the reverse link are both in a good condition. However, upon receipt of the NACK signal, the mobile station judges that the reverse link is in a bad condition but the forward link is in a good condition. In addition, upon failure to receive both the ACK signal and the NACK signal, the mobile station cannot judge which of the two links is in a bad condition. The mobile station can merely presume that one of the two links or both of them are in a bad condition.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10C, the base station and the mobile station simultaneously transmit to each other the messages known to themselves. Thereafter, upon receipt of the message transmitted from the other party, the base station and the mobile station transmit ACK signals to each other; upon receipt of a failed message or upon failure  to  receive  the  message transmitted  from  the  other party  within  a<br>
-24-<br><br>
predetermined time, the base station and the mobile station transmit NACK signals to the other party. Upon receipt of the ACK signal, the base station judges that the forward link and the reverse link are both in a good condition. However, upon receipt of the NACK signal, the base station judges that the forward link is in a bad condition but the reverse link is in a good condition. In addition, upon failure to receive both the ACK signal and the NACK signal, the base station cannot judge which of the two links is in a bad condition. The base station can merely presume that one of the two links or both of them are in a bad condition. Furthermore, upon receipt of the ACK signal, the mobile station judges that the forward link and the reverse link are both in a good condition. However, upon receipt of the NACK signal, the mobile station judges that the reverse link is in a bad condition but the forward link is in a good condition. In addition, upon failure to receive both the ACK signal and the NACK signal, the mobile station cannot judge which of the two links is in a bad condition. The base station can merely presume that one of the two links or both of them are in a bad condition.<br>
In the method of FIG. 10A, the base station can detect the channel condition, so that this method can be applied to the case where the base station initiates the power level arbitration to transmit data. In the method of FIG. 10B, the mobile station can detect the channel condition, so that this method can be applied to the case where the mobile station initiates the power level arbitration to transmit data. In the method of FIG. 10C, the base station and the mobile station both can detect the channel condition, so that this method can be applied to the scheduled power level arbitration in which the the power level arbitration is performed at the scheduled time even though there is no data to transmit.<br>
-25-<br><br>
FIGs. 11A through 11C are diagrams illustrating variations in a transmission power and a power control bit with the passage of time during the scheduled power level arbitration. More specifically, FIG. 11A shows the case where the base station and the mobile station simultaneously receive the messages transmitted from the other party; FIG. 11B shows the case where the mobile station receives the message transmitted from the other party (i.e., the base station) before the base station receives the message transmitted from the other party (i.e., the mobile station); FIG. 11C shows the case where the base station receives the message transmitted from the other party before the mobile station receives the message transmitted from the other party. In FIGs. 11A through 11C, To denotes a power level arbitration start time. Since the power level arbitration is performed at the scheduled time no matter whether there is data to transmit, the base station and the mobile station simultaneously initiate the power level arbitration at the power level arbitration start time To. Further, T1 denotes a time where the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted from the base station, and T2 denotes a time where the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11 A, the base station and the mobile station simultaneously receive the power control bits transmitted from the other party at the time T1 (=T2). Prior to receiving the power control bit transmitted from the other party, the base station and the mobile station both transmit the power control bits by increasing the transmission power step by step. After passage of such a transition period, upon receipt of the power control bits transmitted from the other party, the base station and the mobile station varies the transmission powers according to the received power control bits. As it is perceived that the other party controls the transmission power according to the transmitted power control bit, the base station and the<br>
-26-<br><br>
mobile station exchange a state transition message and an ACK signal to make a transition to the normal substate.<br>
Although the present invention is described with reference to an embodiment which transmits a state transition message and an ACK signal, for state transition, it is also possible to make a state transition by informing an upper layer that the power level arbitration has been completed in a physical layer.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11B, the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted from the base station at the time Tr However, at this time, the base station cannot receive the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station. The base station then increases the transmission power little by little and transmits the power control bit with the increased transmission power. After passage of such a transition period, beginning from the time T2 where the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, the base station and the mobile station vary the transmission power according to the power control bits received form the other party, respectively. As it is perceived that the other party controls the transmission power according to the transmitted power control bit, the base station and the mobile station exchange a state transition message and an ACK signal to make a transition to the normal substate on the judgement that the power level arbitration process is completed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11C, the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station at the time T2. However, at this time, the mobile station cannot receive the power control bit transmitted from the base station. The mobile station then increases the transmission power little by little and transmits the<br>
-27-<br><br>
power control bit with the increased transmission power. After passage of such a transition period, beginning from the time T, where the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted from the base station, the base station and the mobile station vary the transmission power according to the power control bits received form the other party, respectively. As it is perceived that the otherparty controls the transmission power according to the transmitted power control bit, the base station and the mobile station exchange a state transition message and an ACK signal to make a transition to the normal substate on the judgement that the power level arbitration process is completed.<br>
In FIGs. 11A through 11C, the initial transmission power is determined as described with reference to FIG. 7. The power level arbitration methods of FIGs. 11A and 11B will not affect the system performance, but the power level arbitration method of FIG. 11C may affect the system performance. In FIG. 11C, the time T2 where the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station precedes the time T, where the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted form the base station. The base station can receive the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, when the receiving power of the power control bit received from the mobile station is similar in level to the receiving powers of signals transmitted from other mobile stations. However, even though the base station transmits the power control bit by comparing the receiving power of the signal from the mobile station with the receiving powers of the signals from the other mobile stations, the mobile station cannot receive the power control bit transmitted from the base station. Therefore, the mobile station will continuously increase the transmission power on the judgement that the base station has transmitted a power-up control bit. As such an interval between T2 and T1 increases,<br>
-28-<br><br>
the mobile station will transmit the power control bit with a transmission power much higher than an appropriate transmission power, wasting the transmission power. To solve this problem, it is preferable that the base station transmits the power control bit with its maximum transmission power from the beginning of the power level arbitration process. The forward link channels are spread with orthogonal codes (e.g., Walsh codes). Therefore, the base station can transmit to the mobile station the power control bit with its maximum transmission power, without interference to the other mobile stations. By transmitting the power control bit with the maximum transmission power, the base station may have a very low probability of receiving the power control bit transmitted from the other party before the mobile station receives the power control bit from the other party. In FIGs. 11A through 11C, after receiving the power control bits from the other party, the base station and the mobile station can control the transmission power in a different way.<br>
FIGs. 12A and 12B are diagrams illustrating variations in a transmission power and a power control bit with the passage of time in the case where the power level arbitration is requested by a party having data to transmit in a slotted substate. More specifically, FIG. 12A shows the case where the mobile station requests the power level arbitration to transmit data, and FIG. 12B shows the case where the base station requests the power level arbitration to transmit data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12A, when there is data to transmit in the slotted substate, the mobile station transmits a power control bit to the base station, for power level arbitration. An initial power for transmitting the power control bit is set to a sufficiently low level so as not to affect the system. For the initial transmission power, refer to the associated description given with reference to FIG. 7. Upon<br>
-29-<br><br>
failure to receive a power control bit transmitted from the base station, the mobile station increases the transmission power little by little to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power, on the judgement that the base station has not received the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station. The mobile station increases the transmission power little by little in an interval between To and T1. Upon receipt of the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station at the time T,, the base station controls the transmission power according to the received power control bit, beginning from an appropriate initial transmission power, and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power. In the interval between T2 where the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station and T1 where the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted from the base station, the base station and the mobile station both increase the transmission power step by step. In FIG. 12A, that the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station at the interval T2 means that a receiving power of the power control bit from the mobile station is similar in level to the receiving powers of the signals transmitted from the other mobile stations. However, in the interval between T2 and T1, since the mobile station cannot receive the power control bit transmitted from the base station, it continuously increases the transmission power. As the interval between T2 and T1 increases, the receiving power of the power control bit received from the mobile station is much higher than the receiving power of the signals received from the other mobile stations, affecting the overall system performance. To minimize the interval between T2 and T1, it is preferable that upon receipt of the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station in the slotted substate, the base station transmits the power control bit with its maximum transmission power. As the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted from the base station at the time T1, the<br><br>
base station and the mobile station control the transmission powers according to the power control bits received from the other party. As it is perceived that the other party controls the transmission power according to the transmitted power control bit, the base station and the mobile station exchange a state transition message and an ACK signal to make a transition to the normal substate on the judgement that the power level arbitration process is completed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12B, when there is data to transmit in the slotted substate, the base station transmits a power control bit to the mobile station, for power level arbitration. An initial power for transmitting the power control bit is set to an appropriate level or the maximum transmission power of the base station. For the initial transmission power, refer to the associated description given with reference to FIG. 7. Upon failure to receive a power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, the base station increases the transmission power little by little to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power, on the judgement that the mobile station has not received the power control bit transmitted from the base station. The base station increases the transmission power little by little in an interval between To and T2. Upon receipt of the power control bit transmitted from the base station at the time T1, the mobile station controls the transmission power according to the received power control bit, beginning from the sufficiently low initial transmission power, and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power to the base station. In the interval between T1 where the mobile station receives the power control bit transmitted from the base station and T2 where the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, the base station and the mobile station both increase the transmission power step by step. As the base station receives the power control bit transmitted from the mobile<br>
-31 -<br><br>
station at the time T,, the base station and the mobile station control the transmission powers according to the power control bits received from the other party. As it is perceived that the other party controls the transmission power according to the transmitted power control bit, the base station and the mobile station exchange a state transition message and an ACK signal to make a transition to the normal substate on the judgement that the power level arbitration process is completed.<br>
In FIGs. 12A and 12B, since the power level arbitration is performed where there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs immediately after transitioning to the normal substate.<br>
FIGs. 13 A and 13B are diagrams illustrating signaling messages transmitted via a reverse link pilot channel and a forward link dedicated control channel during the power level arbitration. In the reverse link, the power control bit (PCB) is transmitted via the pilot channel as shown in FIG. 13A; in the forward link, the power control bit is transmitted via the dedicated control channel as shown in FIG. 13B. In FIG. 13A, preamble signals PA enable acquisition and channel estimation. Further, in the embodiment, the preamble signals transmit information known to both the base station and the mobile station. The information known to both the base station and the mobile station can be a bit stream composed of all "0"s or all "l"s.<br>
FIGs. 14 and 15 are flow charts illustrating the scheduled power level arbitration performed in the base station and the mobile station, respectively.<br>
-32-<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 14, in the normal substate, the base station monitors whether there is data to transmit (Steps 100 and 102). When there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs to transmit the data (Step 104). However, when there is no data to transmit, the base station waits a predetermined time (Step 106). Here, the predetermined time is a maximum holding time of the normal substate. When the predetermine time has not elapsed, the normal substate is maintained, and otherwise, a transition to the slotted substate takes place (Step 108). In the slotted substate, the base station determines whether it is a power level arbitration time (Step 112). If it is not the power level arbitration time, the slotted substate is maintained. Otherwise, if it is the power level arbitration time, the base station transmits a power control bit (Step 114). After transmission of the power control bit, the base station determines whether a power control bit is received from the mobile station. The base station cannot receive the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, if the power control signal transmitted from the mobile station is equal to or lower than a threshold power, PM, of the mobile station. The threshold power PM is a power level at which the base station can detect a received signal after demodulation. If a receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station is equal to or lower than the threshold power PM, the base station increases the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power on the judgement that the mobile station has not received the power control bit transmitted from the base station (Steps 116 and 118). However, if the receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station is higher than the threshold power PM, the base station controls the transmission power according to the received power control bit and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power (Steps 116 and 120). After transmission of the power control bit, the base station determines whether a<br>
-33-<br><br>
receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station is varied according to the power control bit that the base station has transmitted (Step 122). When there is no variation in the receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station, the base station increases again the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power (Steps 122 and 118). Variation in the transmission power of the mobile station means that the mobile station has received the power control bit transmitted form the base station. Therefore, upon detecting variation in the transmission power of the mobile station, the base station makes a transition to the normal substate in any one of the above-stated manners in order to transmit the data, judging that the power level arbitration is completed (Steps 122 and 124). In FIG. 14, the power level arbitration is performed at the scheduled time regardless of whether there is data to transmit. Therefore, when there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs (Steps 126, 128 and 130). Otherwise, if there is no data to transmit, a transition back to the slotted substate occurs (Step 126 and 108).<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, in the normal substate, the mobile station monitors whether there is data to transmit (Steps 200 and 202). When there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs to transmit the data (Step 204). However, when there is no data to transmit, the mobile station waits a predetermined time (Step 206). Here, the predetermined time is a maximum holding time of the normal substate. When the predetermine time has not elapsed, the normal substate is maintained, and otherwise, a transition to the slotted substate takes place (Step 208). In the slotted substate, the mobile station determines whether it is a power level arbitration time (Step 212). If it is not the power level arbitration time, the slotted substate is maintained. Otherwise, if it is the power level arbitration<br>
-34-<br><br>
time, the mobile station transmits a power control bit (Step 214). After transmission of the power control bit, the mobile station determines whether a power control bit is received from the base station. The mobile station cannot receive the power control bit transmitted from the base station, if the power control signal transmitted from the base station is equal to or lower than a threshold power, Pn, of the base station. The threshold power PM is a power level at which the mobile station can detect a received signal after demodulation. If a receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the base station is equal to or lower than the threshold power Pn, the mobile station increases the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power on the judgement that the base station has not received the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station (Steps 216 and 218). However, if the receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the base station is higher than the threshold power P3, the mobile station controls the transmission power according to the received power control bit and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power (Steps 216 and 220). After transmission of the power control bit, the mobile station determines whether a receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the base station is varied according to the power control bit that the mobile station has transmitted (Step 222). When there is no variation in the receiving power of the power control bit transmitted from the base station, the mobile station increases again the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power (Steps 222 and 218). Variation in the transmission power of the base station means that the base station has received the power control bit transmitted form the mobile station. Therefore, upon detecting variation in the transmission power of the base station, the mobile station makes a transition to the normal substate in any one of the above-stated manners in order to transmit the data,<br>
- 35 -<br><br>
judging that the power level arbitration is completed (Steps 222 and 224). In FIG. 15. the power level arbitration is performed at the scheduled time regardless of whether there is data to transmit. Therefore, when there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs (Steps 226, 228 and 230). Otherwise, if there is no data to transmit, a transition back to the slotted substate occurs (Step 226 and 208).<br>
FIGs. 16 and 17 are flow charts illustrating the unscheduled power level arbitration performed in the base station and the mobile station, respectively. More specifically, FIG. 16 shows the case where the base station requests the power level arbitration to transmit data when there is data to transmit in the slotted substate; FIG. 17 shows the case where the mobile station requests the power level arbitration to transmit data when there is data to transmit in the slotted substate.<br>
Referring to FIG. 16, in the normal substate, the base station monitors whether there is data to transmit (Steps 300 and 302). When there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs to transmit the data (Step 304). However, when there is no data to transmit, the base station waits a predetermined time (Step 306). Here, the predetermined time is a maximum holding time of the normal substate. When the predetermine time has not elapsed, the normal substate is maintained, and otherwise, a transition to the slotted substate takes place (Step 308). In the slotted substate, the base station determines whether there is data to transmit/receive (Step 312). The case that there is data to transmit/receive corresponds to the case where the base station requests the power level arbitration. On the contrary, the case that there is no data to transmit/receive corresponds to the case where the mobile station requests the power level arbitration.<br>
-36-<br><br>
If there is no data to transmit/receive in the slotted substate (Step 310), the base station determines whether the mobile station has transmitted a power control bit (Steps 312 and 313). If it is judged that the mobile station has not transmitted the power control bit, the base station maintains the slotted substate. To determine whether the mobile station has transmitted the power control bit, the base station compares a transmission power of the mobile station with a threshold power, PM, of the mobile station. If it is judged that the mobile station has transmitted the power control bit, the base station controls the transmission power according to the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power (Steps 313 and 320). After transmission of the power control bit, the base station determines whether the mobile station has changed the transmission power according to the power control bit transmitted from the base station (Step 322). If there is no variation in the transmission power of the mobile station, the base station increases again the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power (Steps 322 and 318). Upon detecting variation in the transmission power of the mobile station, the base station makes a transition to the normal substate in any one of the above-stated manners in order to transmit the data, judging that the power level arbitration is completed (Steps 322, 324 and 326). In FIG. 16, the power level arbitration is performed because there is data to transmit. Therefore, the base station makes a direct transition to the active state (Steps 328 and 330).<br>
In the meantime, when there is data to transmit/receive in the slotted substate, the base station transmits the power control bit (Steps 312 and 314). After transmission of the power control bit, the base station determines whether a power control bit is received from the mobile station (Sep 316). Upon failure to receive the<br>
-37-<br><br>
power control bit from the mobile station, the base station increases the transmissionpower to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power, judging that the mobile station has not received the power control bit transmitted from the base station (Step 318). However, upon receipt of the power control bit from the mobile sation, the base station controls the transmission power according to the received power control bit from the mobile station and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power (Step 320). Thereafter, the base station determines whether the mobile station has changed the transmission power according to the power control bit transmitted from the base station (Step 322). If there is no variation in the transmission power of the mobile station, the base station increases again the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power (Steps 322 and 318). Upon detecting variation in the transmission power of the mobile station, the base station makes a transition to the normal substate in any one of the above-stated manners in order to transmit the data, judging that the power level arbitration is completed (Steps 322, 324 and 326). In FIG. 16, the power level arbitration is performed because there is data to transmit. Therefore, the base station makes a direct transition to the active state (Steps 328 and 330).<br>
Referring to FIG. 17, in the normal substate, the mobile station monitors whether there is data to transmit (Steps 400 and 402). When there is data to transmit, a transition to the active state occurs to transmit the data (Step 404). However, when there is no data to transmit, the mobile station waits a predetermined time (Step 406). Here, the predetermined time is a maximum holding time of the normal substate. When the predetermine time has not elapsed, the normal substate is maintained, and otherwise, a transition to the slotted substate<br>
-38-<br><br>
takes place (Step 408). In the slotted substate, the mobile station determines whether there is data to transmit/receive (Step 412). The case that there is data to transmit/receive corresponds to the case where the mobile station requests the power level arbitration. On the contrary, the case that there is no data to transmit/receive corresponds to the case where the base station requests the power level arbitration.<br>
If there is no data to transmit/receive in the slotted substate (Step 410), the mobile station determines whether the base station has transmitted a power control bit (Steps 412 and 413). If it is judged that the base station has not transmitted the power control bit, the mobile station maintains the slotted substate. To determine whether the base station has transmitted the power control bit, the mobile station compares a transmission power of the base station with a threshold power, PB, of the base station. If it is judged that the base station has transmitted the power control bit, the mobile station controls the transmission power according to the power control bit transmitted from the base station and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power (Steps 413 and 420). After transmission of the power control bit, the mobile station determines whether the base station has changed the transmission power according to the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station (Step 422). If there is no variation in the transmission power of the base station, the mobile station increases again the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power (Steps 422 and 418). Upon detecting variation in the transmission power of the base station, the mobile station makes a transition to the normal substate in any one of the above-stated manners in order to transmit the data, judging that the power level arbitration is completed (Steps 422, 424 and 426). In FIG. 16, the power level arbitration is<br>
-39-<br><br>
performed because there is data to transmit. Therefore, the mobile station makes a direct transition to the active state (Steps 428 and 430).<br>
In the meantime, when there is data to transmit/receive in the slotted substate, the mobile station transmits the power control bit (Steps 412 and 414). After transmission of the power control bit, the mobile station determines whether a power control bit is received from the base station (Sep 416). Upon failure to receive the power control bit from the base station, the mobile station increases the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power, judging that the base station has not received the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station (Step 418). However, upon receipt of the power control bit from the base sation, the mobile station controls the transmission power according to the received power control bit from the base station and transmits the power control bit with the controlled transmission power (Step 420). Thereafter, the mobile station determines whether the base station has changed the transmission power according to the power control bit transmitted from the mobile station (Step 422). If there is no variation in the transmission power of the base station, the mobile station increases again the transmission power to transmit the power control bit with the increased transmission power (Steps 422 and 418). Upon detecting variation in the transmission power of the base station, the mobile station makes a transition to the normal substate in any one of the above-stated manners in order to transmit the data, judging that the power level arbitration is completed (Steps 422, 424 and 426). In FIG. 17, the power level arbitration is performed because there is data to transmit. Therefore, the mobile station makes a direct transition to the active state (Steps 428 and 430).<br>
