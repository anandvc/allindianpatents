COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"A METHOD OF PRODUCING LIGHT, PLASMA, POWER"<br>
BLACKUGHT POWER, INC., of 493 Old Trenton Road, Cranbury, NJ 08512, United States of America,<br>
The   following   specification  particularly  describes   the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
Grantad<br>
22-03-01<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing light, plasma, power.<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention is hydrogen reactions which may produce light, plasma, power, and novel hydrogen compounds. The light, plasma, power, and compound source comprises a cell for the catalysis of atomic hydrogen to form novel hydrogen species and compositions of matter comprising more stable hydrogen than uncatalyzed hydrogen. The catalyzed atomic hydrogen may react to cause electronic transitions<br>
involving a nonradiative energy transfer mechanism with a net release of<br>
i<br>
energy and the formation of hydrogen containing compositions of matter of further increased stability.   <br>
2.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
2.1	HYDROGEN PLASMA<br>
A historical motivation to cause EUV emission from a hydrogen gas was the spectrum of hydrogen was first recorded from the only known source, the Sun. Developed sources that provide a suitable intensity are high voltage discharge, synchrotron, and inductively coupled plasma generators. An important variant of the later type of source is a tokomak that operates at temperatures in the tens of millions of degrees.<br>
2.2	HYDRIDE IONS<br>
A hydride ions comprises two indistinguishable electrons bound to a proton. Alkali and alkaline earth hydrides react violently with water to release hydrogen gas which burns in air ignited by the heat of the reaction with water. Typically metal hydrides decompose upon heating at a temperature well below the melting point of the parent metal.<br>
-2-<br><br>
II  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An objective of the present invention is to generate a<br>
plasma and a source light such as visible and high energy light<br>
such as  extreme ultraviolet light via  the catalysis  of atomic<br>
hydrogen.<br>
Another objective is  to react hydrogen with a catalyst to<br>
form more stable hydrogen than uncatalyzed  hydrogen.     The<br>
more stable lower energy  hydrogen may  serve as reactants  to<br>
form lower energy hydrogen  of further stability.<br>
Another objective is  to form novel  hydride compounds<br>
comprising   more   stable   hydrogen   than   uncatalyzed   hydrogen.<br>

The binding energy,    of an atom, ion or molecule, also known as the ionization energy, is the energy required to remove one electron from the atom, ion or molecule.<br>
A hydrogen  atom having the binding energy  given in Eq. (1) is hereafter referred to as a hydrino   atom   or  hydrino.   The<br>
designation for a hydrino  of radius where   aH is the radius of<br>
an  ordinary  hydrogen  atom  and   p is an integer, is A<br>
hydrogen  atom with  a radius   aH  is  hereinafter referred  to  as "ordinary hydrogen  atom"   or  "normal  hydrogen  atom."     Ordinary atomic hydrogen is characterized by its binding energy of 13.6 eV.<br>
Hydrinos  are  formed  by  reacting   an  ordinary  hydrogen atom with a catalyst having  a net enthalpy of reaction  of about<br>
m-21.2eV ,	(2)<br>
where   m is an integer.    This catalyst has also been referred to as an energy hole or source of energy hole in Mills earlier filed Patent Applications.    It is believed that the rate of catalysis is increased as the net enthalpy  of reaction is  more  closely matched  to  m-27.2eV.    It has been found that catalysts having a net  enthalpy  of reaction  within   Â±10%, preferably   Â±5%, of m -27.2 eV  are  suitable  for most  applications.<br>
This catalysis releases energy from the hydrogen atom with a commensurate decrease in size of the hydrogen atom, rn-naH.   For example, the catalysis of H{n = 1) to H(n = l/2)<br>
6<br><br>
releases   40.8 eV, and the hydrogen radius decreases from   aH to   aH.    A catalytic system is provided by the ionization of t<br>
electrons from an atom each to a continuum energy level  such that the sum of the ionization energies of the / electrons is approximately   mX 27.2 eV where m is an integer.   One such catalytic system involves potassium metal.    The first, second, and third ionization energies of potassium are  4.34066 eV, 31.63 eV, 45.806 eV, respectively [D. R. Linde, CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 78 th Edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, (1997), p.  10-214 to  10-216].    The triple ionization (t = 3) reaction of K to K3+, then, has a net enthalpy of reaction of 81.7426 eV, which is equivalent to  m = 3 in Eq. (2).<br><br>
Potassium ions can also provide a net enthalpy of a multiple  of that of the potential energy  of the  hydrogen  atom. The second ionization energy of potassium is   31.63 eV; and K+ releases   4.34 eV when it is reduced to K.    The combination of reactions   K+ to K2+ and K+ to K, then, has a net enthalpy of reaction of 27.28 eV, which is equivalent to  m = l in Eq. (2).<br><br>
Rubidium ion  (Rb+) is also a catalyst because the second ionization energy  of rubidium is  27.28 eV.    In this case, the catalysis  reaction  is<br>
7<br><br><br><br>
Helium ion (He+) is also a catalyst because the second ionization energy of helium is  54.417 eV.    In this case, the catalysis reaction is<br><br>
An argon ion and  a proton can also provide a net enthalpy of a multiple of that of the potential energy of the hydrogen atom.    The third ionization energy of argon is  40.74 eV, and H+ releases   13.6 eV when it is reduced to H.    The combination of reactions of Ar2+ to Ar3+ and H* to H, then, has a net enthalpy of reaction of 27.14 eV, which is equivalent to  m = 1 in Eq. (2).<br><br><br>
And, the overall reaction  is<br><br>
8<br><br><br>
(20)<br><br>
An neon ion and a proton can also provide a net enthalpy of a multiple of that of the potential energy of the hydrogen atom.    The second ionization energy of neon is 40.96 eV, and H+ releases   13.6 eV   when it is reduced to  H ,  The combination of reactions of  Ne+ to Ne2+ and H+ to H, then, has a net enthalpy of reaction of 27.36 eV, which is equivalent  to m-1 in Eq. (2).<br><br>
The  energy  given  off during catalysis  is much greater than  the energy lost to the catalyst.    The energy released is large as compared to conventional chemical reactions.    For example, when hydrogen and  oxygen  gases undergo  combustion  to form  water<br>
  (24)<br>
the known enthalpy of formation of water is  = -286 kJ / mole<br>
or 1.48 eV per hydrogen atom.    By contrast, each (n=1)   ordinary hydrogen  atom  undergoing  catalysis releases  a net  of  40.8 eV. Moreover, further  catalytic  transitions  may  occur:<br>
  and so on.   Once catalysis begins,<br>
hydrinos  autocatalyze  further in  a  process  called disproportionation.    This mechanism is similar to that of an inorganic ion catalysis.    But, hydrino catalysis should have a higher reaction rate than that of the inorganic ion catalyst due to the better match of the enthalpy to  m 27.2eV.<br>
2. Disproportionation<br>
Lower-energy  hydrogen   atoms,   "hydrinos",   may   be generated by  the  catalysis  of atomic  hydrogen by  a  catalyst such as al least one of the catalysts given in Eqs. (3-23).    The<br>
9<br><br>
catalyzed  lower energy  hydrogen  atom  may   serve  as  a  reactant of a  disproportionate  reaction  whereby  it  which   accepts energy from  an   second   catalyzed  lower  energy  hydrogen  atom to cause a further release  of energy  as  the first  atom undergoes a nonradiative electronic  transition  to  a higher energy  level while the second undergoes a transition to a lower energy level.<br>
3.    Novel Hydrogen Compounds<br>
Lower energy  atomic hydrogen  may  react to form  a  compound comprising<br>
(a)	at least  one neutral,  positive,  or negative increased  binding<br>
energy hydrogen  species  having  a binding  energy<br>
(i) greater than  the binding energy  of the corresponding ordinary  hydrogen   species,   or<br>
(ii)  greater  than  the binding  energy  of any  hydrogen species for which the corresponding ordinary hydrogen  species is unstable or is not observed because the ordinary hydrogen  species" binding  energy  is  less  than  thermal  energies  at  ambient  conditions, or is negative; and<br>
(b)	at least one other element.<br>
IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OE THE INVENTION<br>
1    Catalysts<br>
The  above  objectives  and  other  objectives  are  achieved  by the present invention of a catalytic reaction of hydrogen to form more   stable   atomic  hydrogen   than   uncatalyzed  hydrogen  which may  serve as reactants  to  form  lower energy  hydrogen  of further stability  to provide  a light, plasma,  power,  and  novel hydrogen compound source.    The light, plasma, power, and novel hydrogen  compound  source  comprises a cell  for the catalysis  of atomic hydrogen  to form novel hydrogen  species and compositions  of matter  comprising  new  forms  of hydrogen.<br>
In  an embodiment,  a  catalytic  system is provided  by  the ionization of t electrons from a participating species such as an atom, an ion, a molecule, and an ionic or molecular compound to a continuum energy  level  such  that the sum  of the ionization<br>
10<br><br>
energies of the  t  electrons  is  approximately   m X 27.2 eV where  m is an integer.    One such catalytic system involves cesium.    The first and  second ionization  energies of cesium  are  3.89390 eV  and 23.15745 eV, respectively [David R. Linde, CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 74 th Edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, (1993), p.  10-207].    The double ionization (r = 2)  reaction of Cs to Cs2+, then, has a net enthalpy of reaction of 27.05135 eV, which is  equivalent to   m = 1 in Eq. (2).<br><br>
And,  the overall reaction is<br><br>
Thermal energies may broaden the enthalpy of reaction.    The relationship   between   kinetic   energy   and   temperature   is   given<br>
by<br>
  (28)<br>
For a temperature of 1200 K,  the thermal energy is 0.16 eV,  and  the net enthalpy  of reaction provided by  cesium  metal is 27.21  eV which is an exact match to the desired energy.<br>
Hydrogen catalysts  capable  of providing a net enthalpy  of reaction  of  approximately   mX 27.2eV where  m is an integer to produce  hydrino  whereby   t electrons are ionized from an atom or ion are given infra.    A further product of the catalysis is energy.    The atoms or ions given in the first column are ionized to provide the net enthalpy of reaction of  m X 27.2 eV given in the tenth  column  where   m is given in the eleventh column.    The electrons  which  are  ionized  are  given  with  the ionization potential (also called ionization energy  or binding energy).    The ionization potential of the  n th electron of the atom or ion is designated by   1Pn and is given by David R. Linde, CRC Handbook<br>
of Chemistry and Physics, 78 th Edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, (1997), p.   10-214  to   10-216 which  is herein incorporated  by reference.     That  is  for example,<br>
11<br><br><br>
ionization  potential,   1Pt =3.89390 eV,  and the second ionization potential,   1P2 =23.15745 eV, are given in the second and third columns, respectively.    The net enthalpy of reaction  for the double ionization of Cs is 27.05135 eV as given in the tenth column, and  m-1 in Eq. (2) as given in the eleventh column.<br><br><br><br>

Lower-energy  hydrogen  atoms,   "hydrinos",  may  be generated  by  the  catalysis  of atomic hydrogen by  a catalyst  such as at least one of the catalysts given in Table 1.    The catalyzed lower energy hydrogen  atom may serve as  a reactant  of a disproportionation   reaction   whereby   it   which   accepts   energy from  an  second  catalyzed  lower energy hydrogen  atom  to cause a further release  of energy  as the first atom undergoes  a nonradiative electronic  transition  to a higher energy  level while the second undergoes a  transition  to a lower energy level. Lower-energy  hydrogen  atoms,   "hydrinos",   can  act  as  reactants to  cause  electronic  transitions  of atomic  hydrogen  with  a further<br>
13<br><br>
release  of energy  because  each  of the  metastable  excitation, resonance excitation,  and  ionization energy  of a hydrino  atom  is m X 27.2eV (Eq. (2)).    The transition reaction mechanism of a first hydrino atom affected by a second hydrino atom involves the resonant  coupling  between  the  atoms of  m   degenerate multipoles each  having   27.21 eV of potential energy [Mills GUT]. The energy transfer of mX27.2eV from the first hydrino atom to the  second hydrino  atom  causes  the central field of the  first atom to increase by  m and its electron to drop m  levels  lower<br>
from a radius of  to a radius of  The  second interacting<br>
lower-energy  hydrogen  is  either  excited  to  a  metastable   state, excited  to a resonance  state,  or ionized  by the resonant  energy transfer.     The  resonant  transfer  may  occur in  multiple  stages. For example,   a  nonradiative   transfer by  multipole   coupling  may occur wherein the central field of the first increases by   m,  then the electron of the first drops   m  levels lower from a radius of<br>
  to a radius of  with   further resonant  energy  transfer.<br>
The  energy  transferred  by  multipole coupling  may  occur  by  a mechanism  that  is  analogous  to  photon  absorption  involving  an excitation to a virtual level.     Or, the energy transferred by multipole  coupling  and  during  the  electron  transition  of the  first hydrino atom may  occur by  a mechanism  that is analogous  to two photon  absorption involving  a first excitation  to  a virtual level and a second excitation to a resonant or continuum level [Thompson, B. J., Handbook of Nonlinear Optics, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1996), pp. 497-548; Shen, Y. R., The Principles of Nonlinear Optics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, (1984), pp. 203-210; B. de Beauvoir, F. Nez, L. Julien, B. Cagnac, F. Biraben, D. Touahri, L. Hilico, O. Acef, A.

The reactor produces hydride ions having the binding energy of Eq. (36).    The cell for making hydrinos may take the form of a gas cell, a gas discharge cell, or a plasma torch cell, for example. Each of these cells comprises: a source of atomic hydrogen; at least one of a solid, molten, liquid, or gaseous catalyst for<br>
25<br><br>
making hydrinos; and a vessel  for reacting hydrogen  and the catalyst for making hydrinos.    As used herein and as contemplated by the  subject invention,  the  term  "hydrogen", unless specified  otherwise, includes not only proteum  (H ), but also deuterium  (2H) and tritium (3H).    Electrons from the electron source  contact the hydrinos  and  react  to form hydrino hydride  ions.<br>
The reactors  described  herein  as   "hydrino  hydride reactors" are capable of producing not only hydrino hydride ions and compounds, but also the  other increased  binding energy hydrogen compounds  of the  present invention.     Hence,  the designation   "hydrino  hydride  reactors"   should   not  be  understood as being limiting with respect to the nature of the increased binding  energy   hydrogen   compound   produced.<br>
According  to one  aspect of the present invention, novel compounds are formed from hydrino hydride ions and cations. In the gas cell, the cation can be an oxidized species of the material of the cell,  a cation comprising  the molecular hydrogen dissociation  material  which  produces  atomic  hydrogen,  a  cation comprising Â£n added reductant,  or a cation present in  the cell (such as a cation comprising the catalyst).    In the discharge cell, the cation can be an oxidized species of the material of the cathode or anode, a cation of an added reductant, or a cation present in the cell (such as a cation comprising the catalyst).    In the plasma torch cell, the cation can be either an oxidized species of the material of the cell, a cation of an added reductant, of a cation present in the cell (such as a cation comprising  the  catalyst).<br>
5.  DATA<br>
A high voltage  discharge  of hydrogen  with  and without the presence of a source of potassium, potassium iodide, in the discharge  was  performed  with  a  hollow  cathode  at the  Institut Fur Niedertemperatur-Plasmaphysik  e V   [R.  Mills,   "Observation of Extreme Ultraviolet Emission  from  Hydrogen-KI Plasmas Produced by a Hollow Cathode Discharge", Int. J. Hydrogen Energy, in press, "Mills-INP"]    which is herein incorporated by<br>
26<br><br>
reference.     It has  been reported  that intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission was observed from atomic hydrogen and certain elements or certain ions which ionize at integer multiples of the potential energy  of atomic hydrogen,   27,2 eV [R. Mills, J. Dong, Y. Lu, "Observation of Extreme Ultraviolet Hydrogen Emission from Incandescently Heated Hydrogen Gas with Certain Catalysts", Int. J. Hydrogen Energy, Vol. 25, (2000), pp. 919-943 which is incorporated herein by reference].    Two potassium ions or a potassium atom may each provide an electron ionization or transfer reaction that has a net enthalpy equal to an integer multiple of 27.2 eV,    In the Mills-INP study, the spectral lines of atomic hydrogen were intense enough  to be recorded on photographic films only when  KI was present.    EUV lines not assignable to potassium, iodine, or hydrogen shown in TABLE 3 were observed at 73,0,  132.6, 513.6, 677.8, 885.9, and 1032.9 A. The lines could be assigned to transitions of atomic hydrogen to lower energy  levels  corresponding to  lower energy hydrogen atoms called hydrino atoms and the emission from the excitation of the corresponding hydride ions formed from the hydrino atoms.<br>
TABLE 3.    Observed emission data from hydrogen-KI plasmas produced by a hollow cathode discharge that can not be assigned to atomic or molecular hydrogen.<br>
27<br><br><br>
b I+ has a peak at 1034,66 A, [31] but none of the other iodine lines were detected including much stronger lines. c The hydride ion emission is anticipated to be shift to shorter wavelengths due to its presence in a chemical compound.<br>
The results  support that potassium  atoms reacted  with atomic  hydrogen  to  form  novel  hydrogen  energy  states.<br>
28<br><br>
Potassium iodide present in the discharge of hydrogen served as a source of potassium metal which was observed to collect on the walls of the cell during operation.    According to Eqs. (3-5), potassium metal reacts with  atomic hydrogen present in the<br>
discharge and forms the hydrino atom   The energy<br>
released was expected to undergo internal   conversion to increase the brightness of the plasma discharge since this is the common mechanism of relaxation.    This is consistent with observation.<br>
The product,  may serve as a reactant to form <br>
according to Eqs. (29-31),    The transition of <br>
induced  by a resonance transfer of 27.21 eV, m = l in Eq. (2) with<br>
(39) (40)<br>
  (41)<br>
The  energy emitted  by  a hydrino which has nonradiatively transferred   m X21,2eV of energy to a second hydrino may be emitted as a spectral line.    Hydrinos may accept energy by a nonradiative mechanism  [Mills GUT]; thus, rather than suppressing  the  emission through internal  conversion  they  do not interact with the emitted radiation.     The predicted  95.2 eV (130.3 A) photon (peak # 19) shown in FIGURE 29 of Mills-INP is a close match with the observed 132.6 A line.    In FIGURE 29 of Mills-INP, an additional peak (peak #20) was observed at 885.9 A.    It is proposed that peak #20 of Mills-INP arises from<br>
inelastic  hydrogen  scattering  of the  metastable  state <br>
formed by the resonant nonradiative energy  transfer of 27.2 eV from a first atom to a second as shown in Eq. (39).    The<br>
metastable  state then  nonradiatively  transfers part  of the<br>
29<br><br><br>
30<br><br>
The X-ray photoelecfron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of KH1<br>
differed from that of KI by having additional features at 9.1  eV<br>
and 11,1 eV.   The XPS peaks centered at 9.0 eV and 11.1 eV that<br>
do not correspond to any  other primary  element peaks may correspond to the  H-(n = 1/4) Eb = 11.2 eV   hydride ion predicted by<br>
Mills [Mills GUT] (Eq. (36)) in two different chemical environments   where   Eb is the predicted vacuum binding energy.<br>
In this case, the reaction to form H-{n = 1/4)   is given by Eqs. (3-5) and Eq. (38).   Hydrino hydride ions H"(n = l/4), H(n = l/5), and  H"(n-1/6)  corresponding  to  the corresponding  hydrino atoms were anticipated.    The predicted energy of emission due to these ions in the plasma discharge was anticipated to be higher than that given in TABLE 2 due to the formation of stable compounds such as  KH1 comprising these ions.    Emission peaks which could not be assigned to hydrogen, potassium, or iodine were observed at 1032.9 A (12,0 eV), 677.8 A (18.3 eV), and 513.6 A (24.1 eV) [Mills-lNPJ.    The binding energies of hydrino hydride ions  H-(n = 1/4), H-(n=1/5), and H-(n = 1/6)<br>
corresponding to the corresponding hydrino atoms are 11.23  eV,<br>
16.7 eV, and 22.81 eV.    The emissions were 1 to 2 eV higher<br>
than predicted which may be due to the presence of these ions<br>
in  compounds with  chemical  environments  different from  that<br>
of vacuum.    The excitation was due to the plasma electron<br>
bombardment.	<br>
