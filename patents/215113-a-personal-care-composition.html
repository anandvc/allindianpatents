				<td>The present invention relates to &amp; personal care composition<br>
This invention relates to the use of hydrophobically modified polysaccharides in personal care products. More specifically, this invention relates to the use of such polysaccharides in personal care products where the alkyl moiety of the hydrophobe has 1-7 carbon atoms.<br>
Prior to the present invention, nonionic water soluble polysaccharides were used in personal care applications of shaving products, such as shaving creams and shaving gels, shampoos, shampoo conditioners, hair coloring systems, skin creams, lotions, facial cleansing products, under arm products, such as deodorants, antiperspirants, and mixtures thereof, lubricating gels, oral care products, such as toothpastes and mouth washes, denture adhesives, hair styling agents, such as hair gels and moussos, soaps, shower gels, body washes, make-up products, sun screen products, and the like. Widely used commercially available polysaccharides include nonionic water soluble polysaccharide ethers such as methyl cellulose (MC), hydroxypropylmeithylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxyethylcellulose (NEC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), and ethylhydroxyethylcelluloije (EHEC) and hydroxypropyl (HP) guar, hydroxyethyl guar, and HP starch and other nonionic starch and guar derivatives. Also, hydrophobically modified polysaccharides are used in personal care products. The use of these prior firt polysaccharides in personal care products sometimes have processing difficulties such as compatibility with other ingredients, solubility with certain other ingredients, clarity (when needed) and stability under alkaline conditions of the personal care products. Also, hydrophobically modified polysaccharide are used in personal care products.<br>
US Patent numbers 5,106,609, 5,104,646, and 5,100,558 are examples of patents that disclose the use of hydrophobically modified nonionic cellulose ethers in personal care products. These patents disclose the use high molecular weight (i.e., 300,000 to 700,000) and long chain alkyl carbon substitution in tho hydrophobe (i.e., 8 to 24 carbons) for use in hair and skin-care cosmetics. Also, US Patent numbers 4,228.277 and 4,352,916 describe hydrophobically modified cellulose ether derivatives, modified with long chain<br><br>
alkyl group substitution in the hydrophobe, US Patent number 4,845,207 discloses a hydrophobically modified nonionic, water-solublo cellulose ether and US Patent 4,939,192 discloses the use of such ether in building compositions.<br>
Certain of the prior art nonionic cellulose ethers have poor compatibility with salts or poor solubility in certain solvents used in personal care applications such as polyhydric alcohols while others are not tolerant to alkaline conditions. Hence, a need still exists in the personal care industry to have nonionic cellulose ethers that have good compatibility with salts, good solubility in certain solvents, and tolerant to alkaline conditions while producing products that do not have color problems, when desired.<br>
1.      A personal care composition comprising a) from about 0.1 % to about 99% by weight of a vehicle system which comprises a hydrophobically modified nonionic water soluble potysaccharide polymer which comprises a water soluble polysaccharide polymer backbone and a hydrophobia moiety selected from the group consisting of 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl group wherein the alkyi moiety is a straight or branch chain having 2-6 carbon atoms, C3-C7 alkyl, aryl alkyl, alkyl aryl groups and mixtures thereof, wheniin the ratio of the hydrophilic portion to the hydrophobic portion of the polymer is from about 2:1 to 1000:1 and b) at least one other personal care ingredient.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that hydrophobically modified polysaccharide having a short chain alkyl group in the hydrophobe moiety have various advantageous properties over prior art water soluble polysaccharide and their derivatives in personal care products. Any water soluble polysaccharide or derivatives can be used as the backbone to form the hydrophobically modified polysaccharide of this invention. Thus, e.g., hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl-cellulose(HPC), methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyimethylcellulose (HPMC), ethylhydroxyethy(cellulose (EHEC), and methyl hydroxyethylcellulose (MHEC) and, agar, dextran, locust<br><br>
bean gum, starch, guar and their nonionic derivatives can all be modified. The amount of nonionic substituent such as methyl, hydroxyethyl, or hydroxypropyl does not appear to be critical so long as there is a sufficient amount to assure that the ether is water soluble. The polysaccharides of this invention are nonionic having a sufficient degree of nonionic substitution to cause them to be water soluble and which are further substituted with a hydrocarbon radical having about 1 to 7 carbon atoms in an amount up to the amount which renders said polysaccharide less than 1% by weight soluble in water.<br>
The preferred polysaccharide backbone is hydroxyethylceilutose (HEC). The HEC which is modified to function in this invention is a commercially available material. Suitable commercially available materials are marketed by the Aqualon Division of Hercules Incorporated, Wilmington, Delaware U.S.A., under the trademark Natrosol <br>
The short chain alkyl modifier can be attached to the polysaccharide backbone via an ether, ester, or urethane linkage. Preferred is the ether linkage as the reagents most commonly used to effect ether fication are readily obtained, the reaction is similar to that commonly used for the initial etherification, and the reagents are usually more easily handled than the reagents used for modification via the other linkages. The resulting linkage is also usually more resistant to further reactions.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a personal care composition comprising :<br>
(a)	from 0.1% to 99% by weight of a vehicle system which comprises a<br>
hydrophobically modified nonionic water soluble polysaccharide polymer<br>
which comprises a water soluble polysaccharide polymer backbone and a<br>
hydrophobic moiety selected from the group consisting of 3-alkoxy-2-<br>
hydroxypropyl group wherein the alkyl moiety is a straight or branch<br>
chain having 2-6 carbon atoms, C3-C7 alkyl, aryl alkyl, alkyl aryl groups<br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein the ratio of the hydrophilic portion to the<br>
hydrophobic portion of the polymer is from 2:1 to 1000:1 and<br>
(b)	at least one other personal care ingredient as herein described.<br>
An example of the polysaccharides of the present invention is the 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropylhydroxyethylcellulose that is completely soluble in water at ambient temperature. Typically, the 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropylhydroxyethylcellulose used in this invention has a hydroxyethyl molar substitution (M.S.). (The number of moles of hydroxyethyl substituent per cellulosic anhydroglucose unit in the cellulose molecule) of about 1.5 to 3.5. The alkylglycidyl radical is generally contained in an amount of about 0.05 to about 50 wt. %, preferably about 0.1 to about 25 wt. % based on the dry weight of the substituted polymer. Preferably the alkyl group of the<br>
is a temperature at which in a clear solution starts to become cloudy and the polymer starts to precipitate out.<br>
The hydrophobically modified hydroxyalkylcellulose of the present invention is an essential inoredient of the vehicle svstem of cersonal care products. In some products, it can be substantially the only ingredient needed for this vehicle system, Another ingredient that may be in tho vehicle system is a surfactant that can be either soluble or insoluble in the composition. A compatible solvent may also be used in the vehicle system that can be either ai single solvent or a blend of solvents.<br>
Examples of the surfactants are anionic, nonionic, cationic, switterionic, or amphoteric type of surfactants. The surfactant can be insoluble (or soluble) in the present invention and (when used) is present in the composition of from 0.01 to about 25% by weight of the composition.<br>
Synthetic anionic surfactants include alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. Specific examples of alkyl ether sulfates which can be used in the present invention are sodium coconut alkyl trtmethylene glycol ether sulfate; sodium tallow alkyl trimelhylene glycol ether sulfate; sodium tallow alkyl hexaoxyethylene sulfate; sodium tallow alkyl diethylene glycol ether sulfate; and sodium tallow alkyl sulfate.<br>
Nonionic surfactants, can be broadly defined as compounds containing a hydrophobic moiety and a nonionic hydrophillc moiety. Examples of the hydrophobic moiety can be alkyl, alkyl aromatic, dialkyl siloxane, polyoxyalkylene, and fluoro-substituted alkyls. Examples of hydrophilic moieties are polyoxyalkylenes, phosphine oxides, sulfoxides. amine oxides, and amides.<br>
Cationic surfactants useful in vehicle systems of the compositions of the present invention, contain amino or quaternary ammonium hydrophilic moieties which are positively charged when dissolved in the aqueous composition of the present invention.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants are exemplified by those which can be broadly described as derivative of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium compounds, in which the aliphatic radicals can be straight or branched chain, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and one contains as anionic water-solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphorate.<br>
Examples of amphoteric surfactants which can be uscid in the vehicle systems of the compositions of the present invention are those which are broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical can be straight or branched chair and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate.<br>
The water-soluble (or insoluble) surfactant is used wilh the polysaccharide of the present invention at from about 0,01% to about 25% of the composition.<br>
According to the present invention, the solvent used in the vehicle system should be compatible with the other components in the present composition. Examples of the solvents used in the present invention are water, water-lower alkanols mixtures, and polyhydric alcohols having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to 6 hydroxyi groups. Preferred solvents are water, propylene glycol, water-glycerine, sorbitol-water, and water-ethanol. The solvent (when used) in the present invention is present in th
The active personal care component is optional because the vehicle system can be the active ingredient component. An example of this is the use' of the vehicle system in a denture adhesive as either a cream or powder. However, when an active personal care ingredient is needed, it must provide<br>
some benefit to the user's body. Example of substances that may suitably be included in the personal care products according to the present invention are as follows:<br>
1) Perfumes, which give rise to an olfactory response) in the form of a fragrance and deodorant perfumes which in addition to providing a fragrance response can also reduce body malodor; 2) Skin coolants, such as menthol, menthyl acetate, menthyl pynrolldone carboxylate N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide and other derivatives of menthol, which give rise to a tactile response in the form of a cooling sensation on the skin; 3) Emollients, such as isosiopropyimyristate, silicone oils, mineral oils and vegetable oils which give rise to a tactile response in the form of an increase in skin lubricity; 4) Deodorants other than perfumes, whose function is to reduce the level of or eliminate micro flora at the skin surface, especially those responsible for the development of body malodor. Precursors of deodorants other than perfume can also be used; 5) Antiperspirant actives, whose function is to reduce or eliminate the appearance of perspiration at the skin surface; 6) Moisturizing agents, that keeps the skin moist by either adding moisture or preventing from evaporating from the skin; 7) Cleansing agents, that removes dirt and oil from the skin; 8) Sunscreen active ingredients, that protect the skin and hair from UV and other harmful light rays from the sun. In accordance with this invention a therapeutlcally effective amount will normally be from 0.01 to 10% by weight, preferable 0.1 to 5% by weight of the composition; 9) Hair treatment agents, that conditions the hair, cleans the hair, detangles hair, acts as styling agent, anti-dandruff agent, hair growth promoters, hair dyes and pigments, hair perfumes, hair relaxer, hair bleaching agent, hair moisturer, liair oil treatment agent, and antifrizzing agent; 10) Oral care agents, such as dentifrices and mouth washes, that cleans, whiten, deodorizes and protects the teeth and gum; 11) Denture adhesives that provide adhesion properties to dentures; 12) Shaving products, such as creams, gels and lotions and razor blade lubricating<br>
strips; 13) Tissue paper products, such as cleansing tissues; and 14) Beauty aids, such as foundation powders, lipsticks, and eye care.<br>
The above list is only examples and is not a complete list of active ingredients that can be used in personal care compositions. Other ingredients that are use in these type of products are well know in the industry. In addition to the above ingredients conventionally used in products for personal care, the composition according to the present invention can optionally also include ingredients such as a colorant, preservative, antioxidant. vitamins, activity enhance, spermacidals, emulsifiers, viscosifying agents (such as salts, i.e., NaCI, NH4CI &amp; KCI), and fats and oils.<br>
The vehicle systems and personal care compositions of the present invention can be made using conventional formulation and mixing techniques. Methods of making various types of personal care compositions are described more specifically in the following examples. The following examples are merely set forth for illustrative purpose, but it to be understood that other modifications of the present invention within the skill of artlssans in the personal care industry can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>

Procedure<br>
To prepare the shaving cream concentrate, the sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide were added to the deionized water in a vessel at room temperature. The temperature of the vessel was then raised to 75oC and stirred for 5 minutes. The stearic acid and coconut acid were separately pre-melted and then each was added to the caustic/water mixture and then stirred for 30 minutes followed by cooling to 55°C. The HMHEC3 was slurried in the propylene glycol and added to the mixture. One at a time, the lauramide DEA (melted), coconut oil, tallow glycerides (melted), and preservative were added to the vessel and stirred for 15 minutes and allowed to cool<br>
This concentrate (225 g) was weighed into a standard 12-oz shaving cream can. The can was then sealed with a valve assembly using laboratory canning equipment and charged with 9,0 g of propeilant.<br>

Tha same experiment as in Example 17 was repeated that *Natrosol® 250 HX was used in place of HMHEC2.<br>
EXAMPLE 18 Clear Stick Antiperspirant<br>
A two phase mothod was used to prepare the clear stick antiperspirant as follows:<br>
Phase I<br>
About 65% of the total propylene glycol used (excluding that which is part of the antiperspirant salt solution) was charged to a reaction vessel. HMHEC1 was added to the vessel and stirred well until dissolved. The vessel was heated to dissolve the polymer. Once the polymer was dissolved, the solution was heatad to 1100'C-1 1 5*0, and the dibenzylidine sorbitol was added and mixed until completely dissolved. This Phase I solution was then cooled to about 100*0.<br>
Phase II<br>
About 35% of the total propylene glycol used (excluding that which is part of the antiperspirant salt solution) was added to the another vessel, stirred and heated to about 60*70*0. The Na4EDTA was added and mixed well to form a slurry. The antiperspirant salt solution was added next to this vessel and the solution was mixed well until it becomes clear and homogeneous. The emollient dirwthicone copolymer, was added and the Phase II solution was mixed until it became clear.<br>
Combined Phaae:<br>
Phase II was added to Phase I while mixing and cooled to 80oC. A fragrance was added at this point and allowed to mix well. The product was poured into a 1 oz. glass jars and allowed to cool overnight After cooling overnight, the samples were tested for physical and chemical properties.<br>
Equipment Used:<br>
Two 400 ml glass beakers, oil bath, clamps, mechanical stirrer, Jiffy stirrer and thermometer, and a covering to prevent contamination, such as plastic wrap.<br>
