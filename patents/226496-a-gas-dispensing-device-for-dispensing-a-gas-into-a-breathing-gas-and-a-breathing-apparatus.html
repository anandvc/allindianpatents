				<td>Description<br>
A gas-dispensing device<br>
The present invention relates to a gas-dispensing device<br>
according to the preamble to claim 1.<br>
The present invention also relates to a breathing apparatus<br>
according to the preamble to claim 7.<br>
In conjunction with respiratory care (with a respirator,<br>
ventilator, anaesthetic machine or other breathing machine),<br>
the physician may sometimes wish to supplement the breathing<br>
gas with a medical gas. NO is an example of a medical gas,<br>
but there are other gases with a therapeutic or other effect<br>
(e.g. anaesthetic, analgesic).<br>
One way to dispense a gas is to utilise a membrane permeable<br>
to the gas. The rate of diffusion then governs the amount<br>
dispensed. Connecting a gas source containing the gas to be<br>
dispensed into the flow of breathing gas in a breathing<br>
apparatus via a membrane is previously known.<br>
One disadvantage of this system is that the gas source may be<br>
bulky. Patient transport then becomes more difficult, or<br>
dispensing may need to be interrupted during transport. The<br>
gas source can also require more rigorous safety precautions<br>
to ensure that the gas source does not leak. This is the case<br>
for e.g. NO and anaesthetic gases. In addition, the gas-<br>
dispensing system must be equipped to prevent overdosing,<br>
even if the membrane or some other component (e.g. a pressure<br>
regulator) should fail.<br>
Another disadvantage of the prior art is that special<br>
monitoring equipment, or special pressures combined with<br><br>
fixed valves etc., are required if a specific total amount (a<br>
given amount of gas) is to be dispensed.<br>
One objective of the present invention is to achieve a gas-<br>
dispensing device that eliminates, at least in part, the<br>
problems associated with gas-dispensing devices according to<br>
the prior art.<br>
Another- objective is to achieve a breathing apparatus, which<br>
allows the dispensing of a gas into breathing gas in a simple<br>
and uncomplicated fashion that is still safe and accurate.<br>
The objective of the gas-dispensing device is achieved<br>
according to the invention when the gas-dispensing device is<br>
devised as is evident from the characterising part of claim<br>
1.<br>
Advantageous refinements and embodiments are evident from the<br>
dependent claims of claim 1.<br>
Instead of a procedure in which a source of gas is connected<br>
to a dosing means, a self-contained chamber is charged with a<br>
specific amount of gas to be dispensed. This is accomplished<br>
by filling the chamber with gas at a specific overpressure<br>
and close it. The chamber also contains a membrane through<br>
which the gas diffuses. When the chamber is placed in the<br>
flow paths of a breathing apparatus (or when at least the<br>
membrane is placed in contact with the flow paths), the<br>
enclosed gas is continuously dispensed. Since the diffusion<br>
is mainly ruled by the partial pressure difference on both<br>
sides of the membrane, the overpressure need not be<br>
specifically large.<br>
Gas dispensing can be suitably regulated by covering the<br>
membrane with a covering means (preventing leakage before<br><br>
use) that can be removed to differing extents. This expose<br>
the membrane to varying degrees, and the amount dispensed can<br>
thereby be varied. The total amount dispensed can never<br>
exceed the amount held in the chamber.<br>
Pressure in the gas-dispensing device drops as gas diffuses<br>
out, thereby causing a drop in the amount dispensed. The rate<br>
of decline is virtually linear. This could be an advantage in<br>
some situations. Some gases need to be dispensed in large<br>
quantities initially but in gradually declining amounts<br>
thereafter until no more gas is dispensed. This kind of<br>
control was previously hard to achieve and demanded constant<br>
resetting of valves or other control components. With the<br>
gas-dispensing device according to the invention, dispensing<br>
gas in declining amounts is automatic.<br>
When dispensing needs to be more uniform over a longer period<br>
of time, an increasingly large area of the membrane can be<br>
uncovered at certain intervals. A large exposed area leads to<br>
large diffusion that compensates for drops in pressure.<br>
However, this does give rise to some variation in the amount<br>
of gas being dispensed.<br>
A more uniform dispensing of gas is provided when the chamber<br>
contains a donor substance for the gas. The donor substance<br>
could be a liquid (e.g. anaesthetic liquid) or a solid (e.g.<br>
an NO donor material). As long as there is a donor substance<br>
present (or as long the donor substance provides the gas), a<br>
partial pressure will be sustained.<br>
In order to achieve completely uniform gas dispensing, it<br>
would be advantageous if the gas-dispensing device comprised<br>
a pressure device that maintains pressure inside the chamber.<br>
One such pressure device could be e.g. a spring-loaded piston<br>
that compresses the gas.<br><br>
This could also be done when there is a donor substance<br>
present in the chamber.<br>
Pressure in the dosage container can be measured with a<br>
pressure gauge. The pressure gauge can advantageously be<br>
battery-powered.<br>
It would be advantageous during long periods of gas<br>
dispensing if the gas-dispensing device were equipped with a<br>
refill means, particularly when the gas-dispensing device is<br>
incorporated into or a fixed part of the breathing apparatus.<br>
The refill means could be adapted for refill of gas and/or<br>
donor substance.<br>
The second objective is achieved according to the invention<br>
when the breathing apparatus is devised as is evident from<br>
the characterising part of claim 7.<br>
Depending on the application, having a separate gas-<br>
dispensing device placed in the flow paths may sometimes be<br>
unsuitable. The breathing apparatus could then be suitably<br>
devised so the gas-dispensing device is a fixed, integral<br>
part of the breathing apparatus.<br>
Integrating the gas-dispensing device with a tracheal tube or<br>
inspiratory line would then be particularly advantageous.<br>
The gas-dispensing device and the breathing apparatus<br>
according to the invention are described below, referring to<br>
the figures, in greater detail.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a first embodiment of a gas-dispensing device<br>
according to the invention,<br>
FIG. 2 shows a second embodiment of a gas-dispensing<br><br>
device according to the invention,<br>
FIG. 3 shows a third embodiment of a gas-dispensing device<br>
according to the invention,<br>
FIG. 4 shows a breathing apparatus according to the<br>
invention with indications showing where a gas-dispensing<br>
device according to the invention could be located or<br>
incorporated.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a first embodiment of a gas-dispensing device 2<br>
according to the invention. The gas-dispensing device 2 has a<br>
closed chamber 4 holding a gas, at a predefined overpressure,<br>
to be dispensed. A membrane 6 is arranged at one end of the<br>
chamber 4. The membrane 6 can occupy a smaller or larger part<br>
of the chamber 4. Gas inside the chamber 4 diffuses out into<br>
atmosphere when the membrane 6 is uncovered. When the gas-<br>
dispensing device 2 is placed in the flow paths of a<br>
breathing apparatus, the gas can be dispensed into a<br>
breathing gas. A covering means covers the membrane 6 before<br>
the membrane is put into use. This prevents leakage of gas<br>
before dispensing is to take place.<br>
The figure shows how the covering means can consist of<br>
different segments 8A-C removed, one at a time (one segment<br>
has already been removed to show the membrane), from the<br>
chamber 4. The magnitude of the dispensed dose can be<br>
selected by exposing the membrane to differing degrees. For<br>
example, exposure of a small area of the membrane 6 can be<br>
selected for neonates, a somewhat larger area for infants<br>
etc. up to the largest area for adults.<br>
Pressure (the partial pressure of the gas) in the gas-<br>
dispensing device 2 drops as the gas diffuses out through the<br>
membrane 6. This leads, in turn, to a drop in the amount of<br>
gas dispensed. This is an advantage with some gases, since it<br>
leads to gentler tapering off of medication. However, more<br><br>
uniform dispensing is desirable with other gases. One way to<br>
maintain the amount of gas dispensed is to increase the area<br>
of exposed membrane 6 by removing more segments 8A-C.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a second embodiment of a gas-dispensing device<br>
10. The gas-dispensing device 10 can be connected to a system<br>
of tubing on a breathing apparatus via a first connection end<br>
12A and a second connection end 12B. Breathing gas can flow<br>
e.g. as designated by the arrow 14.<br>
The gas to be dispensed is in a chamber 16 and is dispensed<br>
into the flow of breathing gas 14 via a membrane 18.<br>
A small piston 2 0 is arranged to compress the gas so as to<br>
keep gas dispensing as constant as possible over time. In<br>
this instance, the piston 20 is driven by a spring 22.<br>
Relatively constant gas dispensing can be achieved, as long<br>
as any gas is left in the chamber 16, by the choice of<br>
dimensions for the chamber 16 and the piston 20 and the type<br>
of spring 22.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a third embodiment of the gas-dispensing device<br>
according to the invention, in the form of a tracheal tube 24<br>
in this instance. The tracheal tube 24 has an end 26 devised<br>
for insertion into a patient's airways. Gas in a chamber 2 8<br>
is dispensed via a membrane 3 0 into the breathing gas flowing<br>
through the tracheal tube 24. The partial pressure of the gas<br>
is maintained for a prolonged time by providing the chamber<br>
28 with a donor substance 29 for the gas. The donor substance<br>
could be a liquid or a solid. As long as the donor substance<br>
can provide the gas, an essentially constant dosing of the<br>
gas is maintained.<br>
The chamber can be refilled with fresh gas and/or donor<br>
substance via a refill nipple 32 when necessary.<br><br>
FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of a breathing apparatus, in the<br>
form of a ventilator 34, according to the invention.<br>
The ventilator 34 can be connected to a patient 3 6 in order<br>
to supply her/him with breathing gas. The breathing gas can<br>
consist of one or more gas components. The figure depicts the<br>
ventilator 34 with a first gas inlet 38A and a second gas<br>
inlet 38B to illustrate this. The gases are mixed in the<br>
correct proportions and quantities in a gas regulator 40. The<br>
breathing gas then flows through an inspiratory channel 42 to<br>
an inspiratory line 44. The inspiratory line 44 is connected<br>
to a 3-way connector 46. The 3-way connector 46 is connected<br>
to a tracheal tube 48 and to an expiratory line 50. The<br>
expiratory line 50 carries breathing gas from the patient,<br>
via an expiratory valve 52, to atmosphere or an evacuation<br>
(not shown). A control unit 54 controls the ventilator. Other<br>
common components in the ventilator 34, such as pressure and<br>
flow gauges, are not shown in the figure because they are<br>
prior art.<br>
A plurality of examples of where the gas-dispensing device<br>
can be placed or made an integral part of the ventilator 34<br>
is shown for the ventilator 34.<br>
Here, a first gas-dispensing device 56A is shown in the<br>
inspiratory channel 42, a second gas-dispensing device 56B is<br>
shown connected to the inspiratory line 44, a third gas-<br>
dispensing device 56C is shown connected to the inspiratory<br>
line 44 and a fourth gas-dispensing device 56D is shown<br>
connected to a tracheal tube 48. The second and fourth gas-<br>
dispensing devices 56B, 56D can consist of the gas-dispensing<br>
devices shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 respectively.<br>
Combinations of the depicted embodiments are fully feasible.<br><br>
Thus, all the gas-dispensing devices can be equipped with one<br>
or more segments according to FIG. 1, a piston and spring<br>
according to FIG. 2, donor substance and a refill nipple<br>
according to FIG. 3.<br>
In a similar fashion, the gas-dispensing device according to<br>
the invention can be used with respirators, anaesthetic<br>
machines, subacute devices (e.g. for home nursing) etc.<br><br>
