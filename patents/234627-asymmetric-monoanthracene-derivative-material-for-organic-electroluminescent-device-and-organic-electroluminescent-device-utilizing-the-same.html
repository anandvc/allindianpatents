DESCRIPTION<br>
ASYMMETRIC MONOANTHRACENE DERIVATIVE, MATERIAL FOR<br>
ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE AND ORGANIC<br>
ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICE UTILIZING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an asymmetric monoanthracene derivative, a material for an organic electroluminescent device and an organic electroluminescent device making use of it, more specifically to an organic electroluminescent device having a high luminous efficiency and a long life, an asymmetric monoanthracene derivative which materializes the same and a. material for an organic electroluminescent device -<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An organic electroluminescent device (hereinafter "electroluminescent" shall be abbreviated as EL) is a spontaneous luminescent device making use of the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by recombination energy of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode by applying an electric<br><br>
field. Since a low voltage-driven organic EL device of a laminate type was reported by C. W. Tang of Eastman Kodak Company (C- W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 51, p. 913, 1987), researches on organic EL devices comprising organic materials as structural materials have actively been carried out. Tang et al. use tris (8-<br>
hydroxyquinolinolaluminum) for the luminescent layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer.  The advantages of a laminate structure include an elevation in an efficiency of injecting holes into a luminescent layer, a rise in a forming efficiency of excitons formed by blocking electrons injected from a cathode to recombine them and shutting up of excitons formed in the luminescent layer. As shown in the above example, a two layer type comprising a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and luminescent layer and a three layer type comprising a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a luminescent layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known as the device structures of the organic EL device.  In such laminate type structural devices, device structures and forming methods are studied in order to enhance a recombination<br><br>
Efficiency of holes and electrons injected.<br>
Known as luminescent materials are luminescent materials such as chelate complexes such as a tris(8-quinolinolate)aluminum complex, coumarin derivatives, tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives and oxadiazole derivatives.  It is reported that luminescence of a blue color to a red color in a visible region is obtained from them, and it is expected that a color display device is materialized (for example, patent document 1, patent document 2 and patent document 3)<br>
Further, a device using a phenylanthracene derivative as a luminescent material is disclosed in patent document 4.  Such anthracene derivative is used as a blue color luminescent material, and it has been desired to extend the device life. A material having a naphthyl group in 9 and 10 positions of anthracene is disclosed in patent document 5, and a material having a fluoranthene group in 9 and 10 positions of anthracene is disclosed in patent document 6.  These anthracene derivatives are also used as a blue color luminescent material, and it has been desired as well to improve the device life. Further, it is disclosed in patent document 7 to use various anthracene derivatives as a hole transporting<br><br>
material. However, they have not yet been evaluated as a luminescent material.<br>

Further, use of the compound having a specific monoanthracene structure of an asymmetric type represented by Formula (1) shown below makes it possible to lower a depositing temperature of the compound and inhibits the compound from being thermally decomposed in deposition.<br>
That is, the present invention provides an asymmetric monoanthracene derivative represented by Formula (1) shown below, a material for an organic EL device comprising the above asymmetric monoanthracene derivative and an organic EL device in which an organic thin film layer comprising a single layer or plural layers including a luminescent layer is interposed between a cathode and an anode, wherein at least one of the above organic thin film layers contains the asymmetric<br><br>
monoanthracene derivative represented by Formula (1) in the form of a single component or a mixed component:<br><br>
wherein Ar1 and Ar2 each are independently a substituted or non-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon ring group having 6 to 50 nuclear carbon atoms, and m and n each are an integer of 1 to 4, provided that when m and n are 1 and the bonding positions of Ar1 and Ar2 in the benzene rings are symmetric in right and left, Ar1 is not the same as Ar2 and that when m or n is an integer of 2 to 4, m and n are different integers.<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An organic EL device prepared by using the asymmetric monoanthracene derivative of the present invention as a material for the organic EL device has a high luminous efficiency and a long life.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The asymmetric monoanthracene derivative of the present invention is represented by Formula (1) described above.<br>
In Formula (1) described above, m and n each are an integer of 1 to 4, and they are preferably an integer of 1 to 2.<br>
Provided that when m and n are 1 and the bonding positions of Ar1 and Ar2 in the benzene ring are symmetric in right and left, Ar1 is not the same as Ar2 and that when m or n is an integer of 2 to 4, m and n are different integers.  In the present invention, the symmetric type in right and left means<br><br>
a case where when Ar1 and R9 are substituted in an X1 position and an X2 position in the benzene ring bonded to a 9 position of the anthracene ring, Ar2 and R10 also are substituted respectively in an X1 position and an X2 position in the benzene ring bonded to a 10 position of the anthracene ring.<br>
That is, the anthracene derivative represented by Formula (1) assumes a structure in which the right and left benzene rings bonded to the anthracene ring and substituted with the aromatic hydrocarbon ring groups are asymmetric in right and left, and the anthracene derivative described above has an asymmetric structure.<br>
For example, if substituents in a 2 position and a 3 position in the anthracene nucleus are different but substituents bonded to a 9 position and a 10 position are the same, it is not included in the asymmetric type defined in the present invention.<br>
The derivative in which m and/or n are 1 in Formula (1) described above is more preferred, and when m is, for example, 1, the derivative represented by any of Formulas (2) to (4) is further preferred!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Next, the anode assumes a role to inject a hole into the hole transporting layer or the luminescent layer, and it is effective to provide the anode with a work function of 4.5 eV or more. The specific examples of a material for the anode used in the<br><br>
Present invention include indium tin oxide alloy (ITO), tin oxide (NESA), gold, silver, platinum and copper. The cathode is preferably a material having a small work function for the purpose of injecting an electron into the electron transporting layer or the luminescent layer.<br>

A film thickness of the anode is selected, though depending on the material, in a range of usually 10 nm to 1 µm, preferably 10 to 200 nm.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the luminescent layer has:<br>
(1)	an injecting function: a function in which a hole<br>
can be injected from an anode or a hole injecting<br>
layer in applying an electric field and in which an<br>
electron can be injected from a cathode or an<br>
electron injecting layer,<br>
(2)	a transporting function: a function in which a<br><br>
Charge injected (electron and hole) is migrated by virtue of a force of an electric field and (3) a luminescent function: a function in which a field for recombination of an electron and a hole is provided and in which this is connected to luminescence.<br>

In particular, the luminescent layer is preferably a molecular deposit film.  In this case, the molecular deposit film means a thin film formed by depositing a material compound staying in a gas phase state and a film formed by solidifying a material compound staying in a solution state or a liquid phase state, and usually the above molecular deposit film can be distinguished from a thin film (molecular accumulation film) formed by the LB method by a difference in an aggregation structure and a higher order structure and a functional difference originating in it.<br>
Further, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 51781/1982, the luminescent layer can be formed as well by dissolving a binding agent such as a resin and the material compound in a<br><br>
Solvent to prepare a solution and then coating the solution by a spin coating method to form a thin film<br>

Also, the organic EL device can be prepared as well from the cathode to the anode in an order which is reverse to what was described above<br>
A preparation example of the organic EL device having a structure in which an anode/a hole injecting layer/a luminescent layer/an electron injecting layer/a cathode are provided in order on a light transmitting substrate shall be explained below.<br>
First, a thin film comprising an anode material is formed on a suitable light transmitting substrate by a deposition method or a sputtering method so that a film thickness falls in a range of 1 µm or less, preferably 10 to 200 nm, whereby an anode is prepared Next,a hole injecting layer is provided on the above anode.  The hole injecting layer can be formed, as described above, by a method such as a vacuum deposition method, a spin coating method, a casting method and an LB method, and it is preferably formed by the vacuum deposition method from the viewpoints that the homogeneous film is liable to be obtained and that pinholes are less liable to be produced.

The<br><br>
Layer thickness falls preferably in a range of 10 to 40 nm.<br>
Next, an electron injecting layer is provided on the above luminescent layer. Also in this case, it is preferably formed by the vacuum deposition method as is the case with the hole injecting layer and the luminescent layer since the homogeneous film has to be obtained.  The depositing conditions thereof can be selected from the same condition ranges as in the hole injecting layer and the luminescent layer.<br>
Lastly, a cathode is laminated, whereby an organic EL device can be obtained.  The cathode is constituted from metal, and therefore the deposition method and the sputtering method can be used. However, the vacuum deposition method is preferred in order to protect the organic substance layer of the base from being damaged in making the film.<br>

An electric current does not flow by applying a voltage with the reverse polarities, and luminance is not caused at all.  Further, when applying an AC voltage, uniform luminance can be observed only when the anode<br><br>
Has a polarity of plus and the cathode has a polarity of minus.  The waveform of an alternating current applied may be optional.<br>
