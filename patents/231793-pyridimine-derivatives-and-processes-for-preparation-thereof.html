Test Example 1 : Inhibition of proton pump(H+/K+-- ATPase) activity<br>
The gastric vesicle as an enzyme source was prepared by the same method as in the Experiment 1-1 of WO 94/14795. Further, the inhibitory effect of proton pump activity was measured by the same method as in Experiment 1-2 of WO 94/14795.<br>
Namely, the proton pump activity stimulated by Mg++ was used as a negative control group, and the activity stimulated by  Mg++ and K+ was used as a positive control group. Omeprazole was used as the control compound.<br>
Test tubes were divided into 4 groups: Group 1 as negative control group (n=3), Group 2 as positive control group (n=3), Group 3 (n=5X2) to be administered with the compound of the present invention and Group 4 (n=5X2) to be administered with the control compound.<br>
The inhibitory effects of Group 3 and 4 on proton pump activity were measured by employing the compounds prepared in Examples and omeprazole, respectively, each of which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 5 different concentrations.<br>
To each of Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 was added O.lml of magnesium chloride 4mM) dissolved in 40mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.4) and 100ul of enzyme source. The 50ulof potassium chloride (60mM) and 50µlof<br>
ammonium chloride (6mM) dissolved in 40mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.4) were added to all groups except for Group 1 .<br>
of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each of Group 1 and 2; and to Group 3 was added10ulof dimethyl sulfoxide solution prepared by dissolving compound of Example at 5 different concentrations (n=5X2). To Group 4, was added 10ulof the solution prepared by dissolving omeprazole in dimethyl sulfoxide at 5 different concentrations (40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5p M) (n=5X2). 40mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.4) was added thereto so as to make the total volume 400ul<br>
Thereafter, the test tubes of each Group were placed at 37 °C for 30 minutes for the preincubation. ATP solution (6.6 mM) was added until the total volume became 500//£. After the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 minutes, 25% cold trichloroactic acid was added to terminate the enzyme reaction. The released inorganic phosphorous was measured by an automatic analyzer (Express 550, Coming).<br>
The difference between Group 1 and Group 2 represents the proton pump activity activated by KT only. The IC50S of Group 3 and 4 were calculated using the Linear Regression method. The concentrations of the test compounds inhibiting 50% of the proton pump activity are represented as IC50 in Table 1.<br>

(Table  Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 1, the compounds of the present invention exhibit the highly potent acid pump inhibitory activity over omeprazole.<br>
Test Example 2 : Inhibition of gastric secretion<br>
In accordance with the method disclosed in Shay, H., et al.,<br>
Gastroenterology 5, 43-61 (1945), the inhibitory activity against acid secretion was evaluated.<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats having a body weight of 200 ± 0g were divided into 3 groups (n=5) and deprived of food for 24 hours before the experiment with free access to water. Under ether anesthesia, the abdomen was incised, and the pylorus was ligated.<br>
As a comparative group, Group 1 was administered intraduodenally in the volume of 0.5ml/200g of 0.5% methylcellulose<br>
\«<br>
solution. Group 2 and 3 were administered intraduodenally in the volume of 0.5ml/200g of the compound of Example and omeprazole, respectively, each of which was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution at a concentration of lOmg/kg. After 5 hours from ligation, the rats were sacrificed, and the gastric contents were collected.<br>
The gastric juice collected was centrifnged at l,000g to remove precipitates. The volume and pH of the gastric juice were measured. Relative volumes, relative acid concentrations, and relative acid outputs of the test compounds were calculated from equations (I), (II), and (HI) and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Relative volume         	(I)<br>
= (the average volume of gastric juice of Group 1 -   the average volume of gastric juice of Group 2)<br>
/ (the average volume of gastric juice of Group 1 - the average volume of gastric juice of Group 2)<br>
Relative acid concentration    	(II)<br>
= (the average acidity of Group 1 - the average acidity of Group 2) / (the average acidity of Group 1 - the average acidity of Group 3)<br>
Relative acid output   	(III)the total volume of acid output of Group 1 - the total volume of acid<br><br>
output of Group 2)<br>
/(the total volume of acid output of Group 1 - the total volume of acid output of Group 3)<br>

As shown in Table 2, the compounds of the present invention exhibit the highly potent inhibitory activity against gastric acid secretion over omeprazole.<br><br><br><br><br>
