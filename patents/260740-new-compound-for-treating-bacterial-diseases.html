The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068267<br><br>

ANTIBACTERIAL QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted quinoline derivatives useful for the 5     treatment of bacterial diseases, including but not limited to diseases caused by<br>
pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium andM. marinum, or pathogenic Staphylococci or Streptococci<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a serious and potentially fatal infection with a world-wide distribution. Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that more than 8 million people contract TB each year, and 2 million people die from tuberculosis yearly. In the last decade, TB cases have<br>
15     grown 20% worldwide with the highest burden in the most impoverished communities. If these trends continue, TB incidence will increase by 41% in the next twenty years. Fifty years since the introduction of an effective chemotherapy, TB remains after AIDS, the leading infectious cause of adult mortality in the world. Complicating the TB epidemic is the rising tide of multi-drug- resistant strains, and the deadly symbiosis<br>
20     with HIV. People who are HIV-positive and infected with TB are 30 times more likely to develop active TB than people who are HTV-negative and TB is responsible for the death of one out of every three people with HIV/AIDS worldwide<br>
Existing approaches to treatment of tuberculosis all involve the combination of multiple 25     agents. For example, the regimen recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service is a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin alone for a further four months. These drugs are continued for a further seven months in patients infected with HIV. For patients infected with multiÂ¬drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, agents such as ethambutol, streptomycin, 30     kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine, ciprofoxacin and<br>
ofloxacin are added to the combination therapies. There exists no single agent that is effective in the clinical treatment of tuberculosis, nor any combination of agents that offers the possibility of therapy of less than six months' duration.<br>
35     There is a high medical need for new drugs that improve current treatment by enabling regimens that facilitate patient and provider compliance. Shorter regimens and those that require less supervision are the best way to achieve this. Most of the benefit from<br><br>
WO 2008/068267	- 3 	PCT/EP2007/063313<br>
treatment comes in the first 2 months, during the intensive, or bactericidal, phase when four drugs are given together; the bacterial burden is greatly reduced, and patients become noninfectious. The 4- to 6-month continuation, or sterilizing, phase is required to eliminate persisting bacilli and to minimize the risk of relapse. A potent sterilizing 5     drug that shortens treatment to 2 months or less would be extremely beneficial. Drugs that facilitate compliance by requiring less intensive supervision also are needed. Obviously, a compound that reduces both the total length of treatment and the frequency of drug administration would provide the greatest benefit.<br>
10     Complicating the TB epidemic is the increasing incidence of multi-drug- resistant<br>
strains or MDR-TB. Up to four percent of all cases worldwide are considered MDR-TB - those resistant to the most effective drugs of the four-drug standard, isoniazid and rifampin. MDR-TB is lethal when untreated and cannot be adequately treated through the standard therapy, so treatment requires up to 2 years of "second-line" drugs. These<br>
15     drugs are often toxic, expensive and marginally effective. In the absence of an effective therapy, infectious MDR-TB patients continue to spread the disease, producing new infections with MDR-TB strains. There is a high medical need for a new drug with a new mechanism of action, which is likely to demonstrate activity against drug resistant, in particular MDR strains.<br>
20<br>
The term "drug resistant" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter is a term well understood by the person skilled in microbiology. A drug resistant Mycobacterium is a Mycobacterium which is no longer susceptible to at least one previously effective drug; which has developed the ability to withstand antibiotic attack by at least one previously<br>
25      effective drug. A drug resistant strain may relay that ability to withstand to its progeny. Said resistance may be due to random genetic mutations in the bacterial cell that alters its sensitivity to a single drug or to different drugs.<br>
MDR tuberculosis is a specific form of drug resistant tuberculosis due to a bacterium resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin (with or without resistance to other drugs),<br>
30     which are at present the two most powerful anti-TB drugs. Thus, whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter "drug resistant" includes multi drug resistant.<br>
Another factor in the control of the TB epidemic is the problem of latent TB. In spite of decades of tuberculosis (TB) control programs, about 2 billion people are infected by 35     M. tuberculosis, though asymptomatically. About 10% of these individuals are at risk of developing active TB during their lifespan. The global epidemic of TB is fuelled by infection of HIV patients with TB and rise of multi-drug resistant TB strains<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068267	4	PCT/EP2007/063313<br>
(MDR-TB). The reactivation of latent TB is a high risk factor for disease development and accounts for 32% deaths in HIV infected individuals. To control TB epidemic, the need is to discover new drugs that can kill dormant or latent bacilli. The dormant TB can get reactivated to cause disease by several factors like suppression of host 5     immunity by use of immunosuppressive agents like antibodies against tumornecrosis factor a or interferon-?. In case of HIV positive patients the only prophylactic treatment available for latent TB is two- three months regimens of rifampicin, pyrazinamide.   The efficacy of the treatment regime is still not clear and furthermore the length of the treatments is an important constrain in resource-limited environments.<br>
10     Hence there is a drastic need to identify new drugs, which can act as chemoprophylatic agents for individuals harboring latent TB bacilli.<br>
The tubercle bacilli enter healthy individuals by inhalation; they are phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages of the lungs. This leads to potent immune response and formation of granulomas, which consist of macrophages infected withM. tuberculosis<br>
15     surrounded by T cells. After a period of 6-8 weeks the host immune response cause death of infected cells by necrosis and accumulation of caseous material with certain extracellular bacilli, surrounded by macrophages, epitheloid cells and layers of lymphoid tissue at the periphery. In case of healthy individuals, most of the mycobacteria are killed in these environments but a small proportion of bacilli still<br>
20     survive and are thought to exist in a non-replicating, hypometabolic state and are tolerant to killing by anti-TB drugs like isoniazid. These bacilli can remain in the altered physiological environments even for individual's lifetime without showing any clinical symptoms of disease. However, in 10% of the cases these latent bacilli may reactivate to cause disease. One of the hypothesis about development of these<br>
25     persistent bacteria is patho-physiological environment in human lesions namely,<br>
reduced oxygen tension, nutrient limitation, and acidic pH. These factors have been postulated to render these bacteria phenotypically tolerant to major anti-mycobacterial drugs.<br>
30     In addition to the management of the TB epidemic, there is the emerging problem of resistance to first-line antibiotic agents. Some important examples include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multi-resistant salmonellae.<br>
35     The consequences of resistance to antibiotic agents are severe. Infections caused by<br>
resistant microbes fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Treatment failures also lead to longer periods of infectivity, which<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068267<br><br>
5<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063313<br><br>
increase the numbers of infected people moving in the community and thus exposing the general population to the risk of contracting a resistant strain infection. Hospitals are a critical component of the antimicrobial resistance problem worldwide. The combination of highly susceptible patients, intensive and prolonged antimicrobial 5     use, and cross-infection has resulted in infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens.<br>
Self-medication with antimicrobials is another major factor contributing to resistance. Self-medicated antimicrobials may be unnecessary, are often inadequately dosed, or 10     may not contain adequate amounts of active drug.<br>
Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Patients forget to take medication, interrupt their treatment when they begin to feel better, or may be unable to afford a full course, thereby creating an ideal environment for 15     microbes to adapt rather than be killed.<br>
Because of the emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics, physicians are confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy. The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections impose an increasing burden for health care systems 20     worldwide.<br>
Therefore, there is a high need for new compounds to treat bacterial infections, especially mycobacterial infections including drug resistant and latent mycobacterial infections, and also other bacterial infections especially those caused by resistant 25     bacterial strains.<br>
WO2004/011436, WO2005/070924, WO2005/070430 and W02005/075428 disclose certain substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against Mycobacteria, in particular against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. WO2005/117875 describes substituted<br>
30     quinoline derivatives having activity against resistant Mycobacterial strains.<br>
WO2006/067048 describes substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against latent tuberculosis. One particular compound of these substituted quinoline derivatives is described in Science (2005), 307, 223-227 and its mode of action is described in WO2006/035051.<br>
35<br>
Other substituted quinolines are disclosed in US-5,965,572 (The United States of America) for treating antibiotic resistant infections and in WO00/34265 to inhibit the<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068267	6	PCT7EP2007/063313<br>
growth of bacterial microorganisms.<br><br>
10<br><br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, in particular substituted quinoline derivatives, having the property of inhibiting bacterial growth especially of mycobacteria but also of other bacteria such as Streptococci and Staphylococci and the compounds are therefore useful for the treatment of bacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the latent disease and including drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains), M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium andM. marinum.<br><br>

Conversely, said acid or base addition salt forms can be converted into the free forms 35     by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br><br>
WO 2008/068267	10	PCT/EP2007/063313<br>
The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt also comprises the quaternary ammonium salts (quaternary amines) which the compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (la) or (lb) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted 5     Ci-ealkylhalide, arylCi^alkylhalide, d-ealkylcarbonylhalide, arylcarbonylhalide, HetCi-6alkyIhalide or Hetcarbonylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Preferably, Het represents a monocyclic heterocycle selected from furanyl or thienyl; or a bicyclic heterocycle selected from benzofuranyl or benzothienyl; each monocyclic and bicyclic heterocycle may optionally be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents, each<br>
10     substituent independently selected from the group of halo, alkyl and aryl. Preferably, the quaternizing agent is Ci-ealkylhalide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as Ci-galkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, Ci^alkyl methanesulfonates, and Ci-ealkyl/7-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro,<br>
15     bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate, acetate, triflate, sulfate, sulfonate. Preferably, the counterion is iodo. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
The term solvate comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms which the 20     compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are able to form, as well as the salts thereof. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
In the framework of this application, a compound according to the invention is inherently intended to comprise all stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. The term<br>
25     "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (la) and (lb), and their TV-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
30     In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusammen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
35     Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (la) and (lb) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068267	- I I-	PCTVEP2007/063313<br>
Of special interest are those compounds of formula (la) or (lb) which are stereochemically pure.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known 5     absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R*] or [R*,S*\t where i?* is always specified as the reference center and [R*,R*\ indicates centers with the same chirality and [#*,Â£*] indicates 10     centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R*. $*]. If "a" and "P" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the<br>
15     ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "p", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>

When a specific stereoisomers form is indicated, this means that said form is substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50 %, preferably less than 20 %, more preferably less than 10 %, even more preferably less than 5 %, further preferably less than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomers). Thus, when a<br>
25      compound of formula (la) or (lb) is for instance specified as (R,S), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (S,R) isomer.<br>
Compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) and some of the intermediate compounds invariably have at least two stereogenic centers in their structure which may lead to at 30     least 4 stereochemically different structures.<br>
The compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) may be synthesized in the form of mixtures, in particular racemic mixtures, of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of 35     either formula (la) and (lb) may be converted into the Corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068267	-12-	PCI7EP2007/063313<br>
enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric 5     forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs<br>
stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starring materials.<br>
10     The tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are meant to comprise those compounds of formula (la) or (lb) wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into a keto group (keto-enol tautomerism).

20     The compounds of formula (la) and (lb) may be converted to the corresponding<br>
W-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its W-oxide form. Said iV-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (la) or (lb) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide,<br>
25     alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t.butyl hydro-peroxide.

Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 100 ul of<br>
15     Middlebrook (lx) broth medium. Subsequently, stock solutions (10 x final test<br>
concentration) of compounds were added in 25 ul volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial fiveÂ¬fold dilutions were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). Pipette tips were changed<br>
20     after every 3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobic compounds. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Approximately 5000 CFU per well of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37RV), in a volume of 100 ul in Middlebrook (lx) broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume<br>
25     of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The<br>
cultures were incubated at 37Â°C for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). One day before the end of incubation, 6 days after inoculation, Resazurin (1 ;5) was added to all wells in a volume of 20 ul and plates were incubated for another 24 hours at 37Â°C. On day 7 the bacterial growth was<br>

Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 ul in 180 ul) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp.,<br>

The bacteria used in this study were grown overnight in flasks containing 100 ml Mueller-Hinton Broth (Becton Dickinson - cat. no. 275730) in sterile de-ionized water, with shaking, at 37 Â°C. Stocks (0.5 ml/tube) were stored at -70 Â°C until use. Bacteria titrations were performed in microtiter plates to detect the TCID50, in which the 5     TCID50 represents the dilution that gives rise to bacterial growth in 50 % of inoculated cultures.<br>
In general, an inoculum level of approximately 100 TCID50 was used for susceptibility testing.<br>

Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 180 ul of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes in column 2. Serial<br>
15     five-fold dilutions (45 ul in 180 ul) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to reach column 11. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Depending on the bacteria type, approximately 10 to 60 CFU per well of bacteria inoculum (100 TCID50), in a volume of 100 ul in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to<br>
20     the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without<br>
inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hours under a normal atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, one day after inoculation, the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically. Therefore resazurin (0.6 mg/ml) was added in a<br>
25     volume of 20 ul to all wells 3 hours after inoculation, and the plates were re-incubated overnight. A change in colour from blue to pink indicated the growth of bacteria. The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The % growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to<br>
30     standard methods. The IC90 (expressed in ug/ml) was defined as the 90 % inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth. The results are shown in Table 6.<br><br>

Time kill assays<br>
Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds may be determined in a time<br>
10     kill assay using the broth microdilution method *. In a time kill assay on<br>
Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the starting inoculum of S. aurues and MRSA is 106 CFU / ml in Muller Hinton broth. The antibacterial compounds are used at the concentration of 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (i.e. IC90 as determined in microtitre plate assay). Wells receiving no antibacterial agent<br>
15     constitute the culture growth control. The plates containing the microorganism and the test compounds are incubated at 37 Â°C. After 0, 4, 24, and 48 hrs of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10_1 to 10"6) in sterile PBS and plating (200 jil) on Mueller Hinton agar. The plates are incubated at 37 Â°C for 24 hrs and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by<br>
20     plotting the logioCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The potential carryover effect of the drugs is removed by serial dilutions and counting the colonies at highest dilution used for plating. * Zurenko,G.E. et al.
