Description<br>
Pyrimidine compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel pyrimidine compound, a production process thereof, and a pharmaceutical preparation containing it and use thereof.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Adenosine is an important regulatory factor involved in many intracellular metabolisms in the living body such as regulation of energy levels, cAMP levels, opening and closing potassium channels, and inflow of calcium ions into cells, and its interaction with G protein-coupled adenosine receptors on the surface of a cell is essential for exhibiting these physiological activities. Adenosine receptors were classified under two subtypes, A1 receptor and A2 receptor based on the involvement in adenylate cyclase (J. Neurochem., 33, 999-1003, (1979)), and thereafter, the A2 receptor has been classified under two subtypes, A2A and A2B, based on the affinity for A2 receptor agonists, NECA and CGS-21680 (Mol. Pharmacol., 29, 331-346, (1986); J. Neurochem., 55, 1763-1771, (1990)).  Four receptor subtypes, A1, A2 (A2A and A2B) and A3, have been identified until now. The A1 receptor is a protein coupled with Gi/0 family<br>
proteins. It serves to inhibit the adenylate cyclase as a result of binding with a ligand to thereby decrease the cAMP level and serves to activate phospholipase C (PLC) to thereby promote the production of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and to release the intracellular calcium ions. The A3 receptor is a receptor serving to decrease the cAMP level and to activate PLC to thereby promote the IP3 production and the release of calcium ions, as the A1 receptor.  In contrast, the A2A and A2B receptors are receptors serving to activate the adenylate cyclase and promote the production of cAMP. There is a report that the A2B receptor couples with PLC via a Gq/G11 protein or promotes the production of IP3 and the flow of calcium ions into cells (Clin. Invest., 96, 1979-1986 (1995)). These subtypes are different from one another in their distribution in tissues; that is, the A1 receptor occurs relatively abundantly, for example, in the heart, aorta and bladder, the A2A receptor is distributed relatively abundantly, for example, in the eyeballs and skeletal muscles, the A3 receptor, for example, in the spleen, uterus, and prostate, and the A2B receptor, for example, in the proximal colon, and subsequently in the eyeballs, lung, uterus and bladder (Br. J. Pharmacol., 118, 1461-1468 (1996)).  It is believed that these adenosine receptor subtypes can exhibit specific functions, respectively, due to the difference in distribution in the tissues as well as the difference in adenosine level among the locations and the difference in affinity for the ligand among the subtypes. Adenosine is involved in a variety of<br>
physiological functions such as platelet aggregation, heart rate, smooth muscle tonus, inflammation, release of neurotransmitters, neurotransmission, hormone release, cell-differentiation, cell growth, cell death, and DNA biosynthesis. Accordingly, the relation between adenosine and diseases such as central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, respiratory diseases, and immune diseases has been suggested, and the efficacy of agonists/antagonists of the adenosine receptors on these diseases has been expected. Antagonists against the adenosine receptors, particularly those against the adenosine A2 receptor have been discussed as effective as an agent for treating or preventing diabetes mellitus, diabetic complications, diabetic retinopathy, obesity or asthma and have been expected useful as, for example, a hypoglycemic agent, an agent for improving glucose intolerance, an insulin sensitizer, a hypotensive agent, a diuretic agent, an antidepressant, an agent for treating osteoporosis, an agent for treating Parkinson's disease, an agent for treating Alzheimer' s disease, an agent for treating an inflammatory bowel disease, or an agent for treating Crohn's disease.<br>
Certain important reports have been made on the relation between the adenosine A2 receptor and the intestinal tract. For example, certain reports have been made that the A2 receptor mediates a colon longitudinal muscle relaxation action (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 359, 140-146 (1999)), and that the A1 receptor, and the A2B receptor occurring in the<br>
longitudinal muscle mediate a relaxation action of adenosine against the contraction of distal colon longitudinal muscle of a guinea pig (Br. J. Pharmacol., 129, 871-876 (2000)).  The relation between the A2B receptor and constipation and other diseases of the digestive organs has been recently found, and a report has been made on an A2B receptor antagonist useful as a defecation-promoting agent and an agent for treating or preventing various types of constipation (JP-A 2000-126489). Such A2B receptor antagonists do not induce diarrhea, have an excellent defecation-promoting action and are expected as  an agent for treating and/or preventing various constipation. They are also expected as being useful for treating and/or preventing irritable bowel syndrome, constipation accompanying irritable bowel syndrome, organic constipation or constipation accompanying enteroparalytic ileus and for evacuating intestinal tracts at the time of examination of digestive tracts or before and after an operation.<br>
Furthermore, in the formation of clinical condition of Parkinson's disease, it has been importantly reported that, adenosine is extremely closely involved through the adenosine A2A receptor in addition to dopamine. For instance, it has been reported that the effects for improving the symptoms of Parkinson's disease will be enhanced by use of L-DOPA together with theophylline which is known as a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 46, 515-517, (1994)). Also, it has been reported that selective adenosine A2A receptor<br>
antagonists areef fective to various kinds of Parkinson' s disease animalmodels (JP 1994-211856 A) .  Parkinson s disease is caused by the degradation or death of dopaminergic neurons projected from the compact layer of midbrain substantia nigra to the corpus striatum. Although the progress of the disease cannot be prevented, the symptomatic treatment with L-DOPA preparations is nevertheless a fundamental treatment making up for a shortage to dompamine. However, the long-term usage of the L-DOPA preparations will reduce the effectiveness thereof and produce some side effects such as involuntary movements and mental symptoms. Therefore, the biggest problem is that sufficient therapeutic effects cannot be attainedby the L-DOPApreparations. The distribution of adenosine A2A receptors in the brain is confined in the corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens, andolfactory tubercle (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 168, 243-246 (1989)), so that the adenosine A2A receptors have been estimated to play an important role in motor function control in the corpus striatum.  In addition, it has been reported that the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the compact layer of midbrain substantia nigra does not affect the adenosine A2A receptor binding ability of the corpus striatum and there is no difference between Parkinson's disease subjects and normal healthy subjects with respect to the total number of adenosine A2A receptors (Neuroscience, 42, 697-706, 1991) .  Recently, it has been also reported that selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are harmless and improve the motor functions of the subjects<br>
suffering from progressive Parkinson's disease without exaggerating dyskinesia with L-DOPA preparations (Neurology, 58 (6, S) S21. 001 (2002.4) ) . As is evident from these findings, it is expected that the adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are useful as therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease.<br>

As pyrimidine compounds, there are only reports relating to 5,6-aromatic substituted pyrimidine compounds in publications such as W097/33883, W098/24782 and W099/65897. However, the relation between these compounds and the adenosine receptors has been neither reported nor suggested and has not yet been known.<br>
As is described above, compounds having an adenosine receptor antagonism, among them, compounds having an adenosine A2 receptor antagonism, and particularly compounds having an A2A and/or A2B receptor antagonism are expected to exhibit an excellent action as a medicament, and strong demands have been made to provide such compounds. However, compounds which have an excellent antagonism against the adenosine receptors and effectively act as a medicament have not yet been found. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to search for and find compounds which serve to inhibit the adenosine receptors (in particular A2A and A2B receptors) and are useful as an agent for treating or preventing a disease to which the adenosine receptors relate.<br>

The compounds represented by the above formula (I) according to the present invention are useful as an adenosine receptor (A1, A2A  A2B or A3 receptor) antagonist and are specif ically useful as an A2B receptor antagonist. Test examples demonstrating the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention as a medicament will be described below.<br>
Test Example 1: Measurement of the binding ability to adenosine A1 receptor<br>
A human adenosine A1 receptor cDNA was expressed in excess in CHOKl cells, and this membrane sample was suspended at a protein concentration of 66.7 µg/ml in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7. 4 (10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl). To 0.45 ml of this membrane sample suspension were added 0.025 ml of 60 nM tritium-labeled chlorocyclopentyl adenosine (3H-CCPA, from NEN Ltd.) and 0.025 ml of test compound. This mixture was left at 30°C for 120minutes,<br>
filtered rapidly under suction through a glass fiber filter (GF/B, from Whatman), and immediately washed twice with 5 ml of 50 mM water-cooled Tris-HCl buffer. Thereafter, the glass fiber filter was transferred to a vial, scintillator was added thereto, and the radioactivity on the filter was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The inhibition of binding of 3H-CCPA to A1 receptor by the test compound was determined using the following formula, and from this inhibition, 50 % inhibition concentration (IC50) was calculated (the following equation). Inhibition (%)=[l-{binding in the presence of the test compound-nonspecific binding)/(total binding-nonspecific<br>
binding)}]xl00<br>
In the above formula, the total binding means 3H-CCPA-bound radioactivity in the absence of the test compound; the nonspecific binding means 3H-CCPA-bound radioactivity in the presence of 100 µM  RPIA ([R]-[l-methyl-2-phenylethyl] adenosine) ; and the binding in the presence of the test compound means 3H-CCPA-bound radioactivity in the presence of the test compound at predetermined concentrations. The inhibition constant (Ki value) in the table was determined from the formula of Cheng-Prusoff.<br>
Test Example 2 : Measurement of the binding ability to adenosine A2A receptor<br>
An experiment of inhibition of binding to adenosine A2A receptor was conducted using a membrane sample (Receptor Biology Inc.) where an adenosine A2A receptor c DNA was expressed in excess.<br>
This membrane sample was suspended at a protein concentration of 22.2 µg/ml in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (10 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM NaCl) . To 0.45 ml of this membrane sample suspension were added 0.025 ml of 500 nM tritium-labeled 2-p-[2-carboxyethyl]phenetylamino-5'-N-ethylarboxyamide adenosine (3H-CGS21680, from NEN) and 0. 025 ml of test compound.<br>
This mixture was left at 25°C for 90 minutes, filtered rapidly under suction through a glass fiber filter (GF/B, from Whatman) , and immediately washed twice with 5 ml of 50 mM ice-cooled Tris-HCl buffer. Thereafter, the glass fiber filter was transferred to a vial, scintillator was added thereto, and the radioactivity on the filter was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The inhibition of binding of 3H-CGS21680 to A2A receptor by the test compound was determined using the following formula, and from this inhibition, 50 % inhibition concentration (IC5o) was calculated.<br>
Inhibition (%)=[l-{[(binding in the presence of the test compound)-(nonspecific binding)]/[(total binding)-(nonspecific binding)]}]xl00<br>
Here, the total binding means 3H-CGS21680-bound radioactivity in the absence of the test compound; the nonspecific binding means 3H-CGS21680-bound radioactivity in the presence of 100 µM  RPIA; and the binding in the presence of the test compound means 3H-CGS21680-bound radioactivity in the presence of the test compound at predetermined concentrations. The inhibition constant (Ki value) in the table was determined<br>
from the formula of Cheng-Prusoff.<br>
Test Example 3: Experiment of inhibition of NECA-stimulated<br>
production of cAMP in adenosine A2B receptor-expressing cells<br>
CH0K1 cells where human adenosine A2B receptor had been<br>
expressed in excess were plated onto a 24-well plate at a density<br>
of 1.5xl05 cells/well, cultured overnight, and used in the experiment. The degree of inhibitory effect of the test compound on the amount of cAMP produced by stimulation with 30 nM 5'-N-ethylcarboxyamide adenosine (NECA from Sigma) was evaluated in terras of affinity for A2B receptor. That.is, the adhering cells were washed twice with 2 ml/well Krebs-Ringer buffer solution (containing 0.1% BSA; pH 7 . 4) and pre-incubated for 30 minutes in a volume of 0. 5 ml/well. Then, a mixed solution containing NECA and the test compound was added in a volume of 0.1 ml/well in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (a product of RBI). After pre-incubation for 15 minutes, the reaction was terminated with 0.1 N HC1 in a volume<br>
of 300 µl/well.. Measurement of intracellular cAMP was carried out using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit produced by Amersham. The inhibition of NECA-stimulated production of cAMP by the test compound was determined using the following equation: Inhibition (%)=[l-{ (amount of cAMP in the coexistence of NECA and the test compound-amount of cAMP in only the Krebs-Ringer buffer solution)/(amount of cAMP upon stimulation with NECA only-amount of cAMP in only the Krebs-Ringer buffer solution)}]xl00<br>

Test Example 5:  Evaluation of Effects on Haloperidol-induced Catalepsy<br>
Parkinson' s disease is a disease caused by the degeneration or cell death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons.. The administration of haloperidol (dopamine D1/D2 receptor-antagonist) blocks postsynaptic D2 receptors to induce catalepsy. The haloperidal-induced catalepsy has been known as a classic model that mimics Parkinson's disease by drug administration (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 182, 327-334(1990)).<br>
The adenosine A2A receptor antagonist compounds identified<br>
by measuring on their binding abilities to the receptors in Test Examples 1 to 3, the salts thereof, solvates of them, or pharmaceutical compositions containing those were evaluated for effect on haloperidol-induced catalepsy by the method described below. That is, the experiment was conducted by eight 5-week-old male ICR mice (available from Charles River) per group. Haloperidol (manufactured by Sigma Co. , Ltd. ) was dissolved in a 6.1% tartaric acid solution and the resulting solution in a dose of 1 mg/kg was then intraperitoneally administered to the mice. The test compound was used as a 0.5% MC suspension. 1.5 hours after the intraperitoneal administration of haloperidol, each of the suspension with the test compound and the suspension without the test compound (control) was orally administered to the mice (0.1 ml per 10 g of mouse body weight) . 1 hour after the administration of the test compound, the degree of catalepsy was measured with respect to each of the mice such that a pair of only forelimbs and a pair of only hindlimbs of each mouse were placed by turns on a stand 4.5 cm in height and 10 cm in width. 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of each of the test compounds were orally administered. Catalepsy scores and criterions are as follows.<br>
Score	Duration of catalepsy<br>
0: When the pair of only forelimbs and the pair of only hindlimbs are independently placed on the stand, the duration of such a posture of each pair for less than 5 seconds. 1: The duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being<br>
placed on the stand was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds, and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was less than 5 seconds.<br>
2: The duration of the posture in which the f orelimbs were being placed on the stand was 10 or more seconds, and the duration of such a posture of the pair hindlimbs was less than 5 seconds. 3: The duration of the posture in which both the forelimbs and hindlimbs were being placed on the stand was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds, the duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was less than 5 seconds and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was 5 or more seconds.<br>
4 : The duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was 10 or more seconds and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds; or the duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was 10 or more seconds.<br>
5: The duration of the posture in which both the forelimbs and hindlimbs were being placed on the stand was 10 or more seconds. The effects of the compound were determined by making a comparison between the score of the control group and the score of the test group in which the test compound was administered. A significant difference was analyzed by Dunnett's-test. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
