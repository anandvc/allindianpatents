				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a self-cleaning device for cleaning<br>
permeability bars, and in particular to a self-cleaning arrangement used for making<br>
iron ore sinter in steel plants producing pig iron through blast furnace and sinter<br>
route.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the process of mining, lot of fine iron ore is generated at mines. However,<br>
these fines cannot be fed to a blast furnace as such to convert them into pig iron.<br>
Hence the need of agglomerating these fines into a lump is necessitated.<br>
Methods of agglomerating iron ores and iron containing waste products have been<br>
under consideration since the end of nineteenth century. The developments of<br>
these processes, however, were accelerated during the second world war. The<br>
various methods of agglomeration are:<br>
a)	Briquetting<br>
b)	Nodulizing (rotary kiln sintering)<br>
c)	Vacuum extrusion<br>
d)	Sintering (grate sintering)<br>
e)	Pelletizinq<br><br>
Of the above methods, the last two are predominantly used for iron ore fines.<br>
Considering the fine ore characteristics, under Indian condition, sintering is more<br>
prevalent compared to pelletizing.<br>
The sintering process consists of mixing moist iron-ore fines and, other fine materials<br>
(e.g. fluxes and steel plant wastes) with solid fuel, normally coke breeze, and<br>
loading the mix on to a permeable grate. The upper surface is raised to a high<br>
temperature by oil or gas burners and air is sucked downwards through the grate.<br>
After a short ignition period, the top surface generates sufficient heat by burning of<br>
solid fuel (coke breeze) and a narrow combustion zone is formed which moves<br>
downwards under the influence of suction through the grate. When the combustion<br>
zone reaches the base of the sinter mix, the process is complete. The sinter cake,<br>
so formed is then cooled and sized for use.<br>
Sintering is a down-draught process where air carries the heat and also supplies the<br>
oxygen necessary for combustion of solid fuel present in it. Research work carried<br>
out by many, especially those of EW Voice and R Wild are considered to be<br>
fundamental for sintering process. Their work has shown that the rate determining<br>
step is the volume of air passing through a sinter bed which allows the heat transfer<br>
between various layers present within.<br><br>
The raw material used for sintering are ore fines, fluxes (crushed limestone,<br>
pyroxenite), solid wastes, coke breeze, lime fines, sinter return fines. All these<br>
materials are taken in a desired proportion and mixed in a mixing drum, where<br>
controlled water addition is done. The green mix so prepared is taken in the surge<br>
hopper positioned just above the sinter strand. Before laying the green mix, first a<br>
thin layer of sinter (15-25 mm size), called hearth layer is spread on the sinter<br>
strand. The aim of loading the strand with green mix is to lay down the material<br>
evenly across the width of the machine, typically in the range between 2.5 m and 3<br>
m) with minimum compacting. This is accomplished by the use of drum feeder or<br>
feed roll. Use of segregation pad at the charging station also reduces the height of<br>
free fall and reduces velocity of falling stream of material.<br>
Permeability bars consist of a set of static strips of metal inserted within the green<br>
mix bed at the charging station. The permeability bars in a sinter machine enhance<br>
the permeability of green mix charged on to the sinter strand. Use of permeability<br>
bar further reduces the compactness of the material charged onto the strand. The<br>
practice of using permeability bar is now 15 years old. The comb like structure<br>
inserted inside the green mix bed creates certain void which is in turn filled up by<br>
re-adjusting of material when it passes under the bed height leveler plate.<br>
Thus the permeability of sinter bed really determines the rate of sintering. Realising<br>
this a lot of developments have taken shape in the charging station of a sinter<br>
machine. One of these is the 'permeability bar'.<br><br>
Permeability of sinter bed is measured in Japanese permeability unit (JPU).<br>
The formula for calculating sinter bed permeability is:<br><br>
Where, WG Volume = waste gas volume in Nm3 / min<br>
H	= bed height in mm<br>
P	= suction in mm water column<br>
This formula is used to calculate the permeability of the sintering plant using on-line<br>
data. The permeability value normally lies between 30-40 JPU (Japanese<br>
permeability unit).<br>
The permeability bars are installed in sinter strands of sinter plants. Although they<br>
act in improving the bed permeability to a great extent, the inherent shortcoming in<br>
the existing permeability bars cause green mix getting deposited on them in no<br>
time, making 'swollen fingers'. These in turn lead to forming unnecessary voids at<br>
the charging station. The difficulty associated with these are two-fold:<br><br>
It creates differential permeability across the width of the bed, and it forms rat-holes<br>
on the sinter bed.<br>
This results in poor sinter quality and loss of production. There was therefore, a<br>
need for overcoming these difficulties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore, is to provide a new attachment<br>
for the permeability bar with an automatic cleaning arrangement which removes any<br>
deposit forming on the permeability bar fingers.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to improve the performance of the<br>
permeability bars and increase their life.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to improve the sinter quality by<br>
providing uniform sinter mix on the strand.<br>
These and other objects of the invention are achieved by providing a set of cleaning<br>
fingers, one for each permeability bar. These cleaning fingers can be separately<br>
supported by the frame and can be slided over the permeability bars for cleaning by<br>
scraping of materials from the permeability bars.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a self-cleaning device for cleaning permeability<br>
bars of a continuous sintering machine comprising a set of clearing fingers<br>
separately supported by a frame, said set of cleaning fingers being slidably operable<br>
over said permeability bars for cleaning the bars by scraping material sticking to the<br>
bars.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The functioning of the device is illustrated in Figures 2 to 5 of the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Fig. 1	shows an arrangement of permeability bars.<br>
Fig. 2	shows a schematic flow diagram of a sintering plant.<br>
Fig. 3	shows the cleaning device in idle position.<br>
Fig. 4	shows the device in cleaning position.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the general arrangement of the permeability<br>
bars with cleaning fingers.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Permeability bars consisting of a set of static strips of metal inserted within the<br>
green mix bed at the charging station is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The essential feature of Dwight-Lloyd sinter machine is a moving strand, which is<br>
made up of a series of pellets (wheeled cars) with a permeable grate and side wall.<br>
The pellets are filled with green sinter mix (also called the green mix), passed under<br>
an ignition hood, subjected to down-draught suction. The sintering process is<br>
completed before the moving grates reach the discharge end, where they are tipped<br>
and returned to the charging position. Therefore, like an endless chain, the pellets<br>
move and carry out sintering as shown in the flow diagram of Figure 2. The<br>
charging station consist of a surge hopper for green mix, feed roll, etc. Permeability<br>
bar is installed under the surge hopper.<br><br>
The green mix, which is fed to the sinter strand contains 6-7% moisture and<br>
therefore, is sticky in nature. Usually, the deposition on the permeability bars starts<br>
from the top. It gradually grows into a bigger lump. As the green sinter mix also<br>
contains lime fines, it makes the build-up strong enough to get dislodged by itself.<br>
The permeability bars remain submerged within a pile of material, which makes it<br>
impossible to approach while the sinter machine is in operation.<br>
The cleaning device of the present invention shown in Figure 3 makes it possible to<br>
clean the permeability bars 1 at regular interval in running condition of the sinter<br>
machine.<br>
A set of cleaning fingers 2, one for each permeability bar 1, is separately supported<br>
by the frame. The cleaning fingers 2 would normally remain outside the green mix<br>
pile. After a fixed interval, they would be pushed forward either manually by an<br>
operating lever 3 of mechanically, by a hydraulic arrangement (not shown) over the<br>
permeability bars 1. The cleaning fingers 2 have a sharpened flaps over them.<br>
While sliding over the permeability bars 1, these cleaning fingers 2 do the necessary<br>
scraping of material. The cutting flap also acts as guide and does not allow the<br>
moving fingers to deviate.<br>
Figure 4 shows the cleaning fingers 2 in advanced position. The cleaning fingers 2<br>
are quickly retracted to its idle position, ready for the next stroke. The mechanism<br>
ensures that the permeability bar 1 always remain clean and therefore enhances<br>
permeability of the sinter mix on sinter strand.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows a general arrangement for the permeability bars with cleaning<br>
fingers of the present invention. It is recommended to connect operating<br>
mechanism with a hydraulic cylinder. The timing for auto operation may be set at<br>
15 minutes interval for best results.<br>
The cleaning device of the present invention provides a very simple solution to a<br>
difficult problem. Due to the position of the permeability bar as shown in Fig. 1, it is<br>
very difficult, if not impossible, to clean them in running condition of the sinter<br>
machine. Whereas, the design of the present invention is capable of easily<br>
removing any deposit as may be forming over the permeability bars (strips) in<br>
running condition of the machine. Depending on the requirement and material type,<br>
it may be operated manually using a lever. Better option would be to mechanise the<br>
cleaning arrangement using hydraulic, pneumatic or even electrical actuators.<br>
The benefits envisaged from the device of the present invention are:<br>
1). No deposit on the bars<br>
2). Longer life of the permeability bars<br>
3). Uniform bed permeability across the width of a sinter strand.<br>
4). Improved productivity<br>
5). Improved and consistent quality parameters of sinter produced, i.e.<br>
a)	Higher Tumbler Index<br>
b)	Higher Cumulative + 10mm of sinter, etc.<br><br>
