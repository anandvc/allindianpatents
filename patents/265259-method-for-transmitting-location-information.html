[DESCRIPTION]<br>
METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING LOCATION INFORMATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for transmitting<br>
location information of a mobile communication terminal, and<br>
more particularly to a method for effectively transmitting<br>
location information, such that it allows a specific<br>
terminal to acquire its location information using a<br>
location information service, or allows the specific<br>
terminal to transmit its location information to another<br>
terminal.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, a mobile communication system provides a Location<br>
Based Service (LBS) capable of recognizing terminal location<br>
information based on a mobile communication network, and<br>
employing the recognized terminal location information. For<br>
example, a service (also called a positioning service) for<br>
tracking a human location or an object location, a vehicle<br>
navigation service, and an emergency rescue service, etc.,<br>
have been widely used as the above-mentioned LBS.<br>
A current mobile communication system generally provides the<br>
above-mentioned LBS service via a control plane of a network<br>
system. However, the LBS service implemented via the<br><br>
2<br>
control plane of the network system employs different<br>
positioning-signaling functions and different positioning<br>
systems according to network structures (e.g., a 3GPP (3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project) and a 3GPP2 (3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project 2).<br>
Therefore, in order to update the service or introduce a new<br>
positioning method into the network,..the above-mentioned<br>
mobile communication system must update or newly introduce<br>
all network components, that should be changed to others<br>
because a signaling and a protocol of the control plane have<br>
been changed, resulting in greater inconvenience of use.<br>
A User Plane Protocol capable of enabling a User Plane to<br>
provide a location information service has been defined to<br>
solve the above-mentioned problems.<br>
The User Plane Protocol has been designed to transmit<br>
specific information required for the positioning service<br>
using the User Plane, such that it is independent of the<br>
network structure. Also, the User Plane Protocol need not<br>
update all network components of the positioning system on<br>
the condition that the service is updated or a new<br>
positioning method is introduced.<br>
However, the above-mentioned User Plane Protocol does not<br>
describe a method for allowing a specific terminal to<br>
receive its location information or a method for allowing<br>
the specific terminal to transmit its location information<br><br>
3<br>
to another terminal, such that unexpected problems occur in<br>
a positioning process.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method<br>
for transmitting location information that substantially<br>
obviates one or more problems due to. limitations and<br>
disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method<br>
for effectively transmitting location information, such that<br>
it allows a specific terminal to acquire its location<br>

Beat Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br><br>
11<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible,<br>
the same reference numbers will be used throughout the<br>
drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
Prior to describing the present invention, it should be<br>
noted that most terms disclosed in the present invention<br>
correspond to general terms well known in the art, but some<br>
terms have been selected by the applicant as necessary and<br>
will hereinafter be disclosed in the following description<br>
of the present invention. Therefore, it is preferable that<br>
the terms defined by the applicant be understood on the<br>
basis of their meanings in the present invention.<br>
The term "Protocol" according to the present invention is<br>
indicative of a communication protocol. The term "User<br>
Plane Protocol" is indicative of a protocol for use in a<br>
User Plane. A representative example of the User Plane<br>
Protocol is a- Secure User Plsane Location Protocol. The<br>
Secure User Plane Location Protocol is indicative of a<br>
protocol for providing a location information service in a<br>
User Plane.<br>
For the convenience of description and better understanding<br>
of the present invention, a Secure User Plane Location<br>
(SUPL) protocol will be exemplarily used as the User Plane<br>
Location Protocol in the present invention, but technical<br>
ideas of the present invention are not limited to only the<br><br>
12<br>
SUPL protocol.<br>
The term "Terminal" is indicative of Input/Output (I/O)<br>
points of information transmitted/received to/from a<br>
communication network, a device for constructing/viewing<br>
data in a digital data transmission system, or a device for<br>
performing data transmission/reception functions.<br>
For. .the convenience of description and better understanding<br>
of the present invention, a SUPL Enabled. Terminal (SET)<br>
capable of enabling the User Plane. Location Protocol will<br>
hereinafter be exemplarily used as the above-mentioned<br>
terminal. The terminal for the User Plane Location Protocol<br>
may also be called a SUPL Agent as necessary.<br>
For example, if a specific terminal requests its location<br>
information or desires to transmit the location information<br>
to another terminal, the specific terminal is defined as a<br>
first terminal, and a Target SUPL Enabled Terminal<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a fiat SET) will be used as a<br>
preferred embodiment of the first terminal. If another<br>
terminal is desired by the first terminal as a destination<br>
at which the location information of the first terminal is<br>
to be received, the desired terminal is defined as a second<br>
terminal, and a Notified SUPL Enabled Terminal (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a second SET) will be used as an example of<br>
the second terminal.<br>
However, it should be noted that technical ideas of the<br><br>
13<br>
present invention can also be applied to other terminals<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention. In association with the above-mentioned<br>
description, the first SET may also be denoted by a Target<br>
SET, and the second SET may also be denoted by a Notified<br>
SET.<br>
The .term "Server" is indicative of a device or program for<br>
operating a management software program, which allows other<br>
terminals contained in a communication -network to access all<br>
or some parts of the communication network, and controls<br>
access to resources of the communication network. The<br>
server may include a location calculator for calculating<br>
location information of a specific terminal/ and a server<br>
manager for performing overall protocol management using the<br>
server.<br>
In this case, in association with the present invention, a<br>
SUPL Irocation Platform (SLP) is used as an example of the<br>
server, a SUPL Position Center (SPC) is used as an example<br>
of the location calculator, and a SUPL Location Center (SLC)<br>
is used as an example of the server manager. However, it<br>
should be noted that the present invention can also be<br>
applied to other servers as necessary.<br>
In association with the present invention, a specific<br>
network in which the terminal has been initially<br>
registered or joined is called a Home Network (HN). If<br><br>
14<br>
the terminal moves to other location and gains access to a<br>
specific network instead of the HN, the specific network<br>
is referred to as a Visited Network (VN) .<br>
A server contained in the HN is called a Home Server or a<br>
H-Server. A server contained in the VN is called a<br>
Visited Server or a V-Server. A server contained in a<br>
network	including the second terminal for receiving<br>
location information is called a Notified Server or a N-<br>
Server.<br>
In this case, in association with the present invention, a<br>
Home SLP (H-SLP) is used as an example of the H-Server, a<br>
Visited SLP (V-SLP) is used as an example of the V-Server,<br>
and a Notified SLP (N-SLP) is used as an example of the N-<br>
SLP. However, it should be noted that the scope of the<br>
present invention is not limited to the aforementioned<br>
examples, and the N-SLP acting as a logical entity may be<br>
identical with the H-SLP.<br>
A first case in which a terminal is located at the HN is<br>
called a Non-Roaming Successful Case. A second case in<br>
which a terminal is located at the VN is called a Roaming<br>
Successful Case. A third case in which a terminal<br>
calculates location information by communicating with the<br>
location calculator via the server manager is called a<br>
Proxy Mode. A fourth case in which a terminal calculates<br>
location information by directly communicating with the<br><br>
15<br>
location calculator is called a Non-Proxy Mode,<br>
For example, in the case where the first SET is located at<br>
the HN, this case is considered to be the Non-Roaming<br>
Successful Case. In the case where the first SET is<br>
located at the VN, this case is considered to be the<br>
Roaming Successful Case. In the case where the first SET<br>
calculates location information by communicating with the<br>
SPC acting as the location calculator via the SLC acting<br>
as the server manager, this case is considered to be the<br>
Proxy Mode. In the case where the first SET calculates<br>
location information by directly communicating with the<br>
SPC acting as the location calculator, this case is<br>
considered to be the Non-Proxy Mode,<br>
However, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
the present invention is applicable to the Non-Roaming<br>
Successful Case and the Roaming Successful Case<br>
irrespective of a roaming state, and the server can be<br>
applied to the Proxy Mode and the Non-Proxy Mode.<br>
The term "Message" is indicative of a single transmission<br>
unit, is configured according to a strict rule, and is<br>
indicative of a transmission unit according to a protocol<br>
acting as a predetermined rule between a transmitter and a<br>
receiver. For example, a User Plane Location Protocol<br>
(ULP) Message is indicative of a data transmission unit<br>
according to the SDPL protocol.<br><br>
16<br>
There are a variety of ULP messages, for example, an<br>
initialization message, a start message, a response<br>
message, a positioning-initialization message, a<br>
positioning message, an end message, an authentication<br>
response message, and a positioning notification message.<br>
The initialization message is indicative of a message<br>
firstly transmitted from the server to the terminal during<br>
the network initialization. The start message is<br>
indicative of an initial message transmitted from the<br>
terminal to the server, such that the terminal requests<br>
the server to transmit its location information or<br>
location information of other terminals using the start<br>
message. The response message is indicative of a message<br>
answering to the start message. The positioning-<br>
initialization message is indicative of a message<br>
transmitted from the first terminal to the server during<br>
the initiation of the • positioning service. The<br>
positioning message is indicative of a message<br>
communicated between the server and the first terminal to<br>
perform the positioning service. The end message is<br>
indicative of a message, which indicates the completion of<br>
a specific process or includes specific state information.<br>
The authentication response message is used when the<br>
network of the Non-Proxy Mode starts operation, and is<br>
transmitted from the home server to the terminal. The<br><br>
17<br>
positioning notification message transmits location<br>
information of the first terminal to the second terminal,<br>
and includes the location information of the first<br>
terminal.<br>
For example, in association with the present invention, a<br>
SUPL INIT message is used as the above-mentioned<br>
initialization ..message, a SUPL START message is used as<br>
the above-mentioned start message, a SUPL RESPONSE message<br>
is used as the above-mentioned response message, a SUPL<br>
POS INIT message is used as the above-mentioned<br>
positioning-initialization message, a SUPL POS message is<br>
used as the above-mentioned positioning message, a SUPL<br>
END message is used as the above-mentioned end message,<br>
and a SUPL AUTH RESP message is used as the above-<br>
mentioned authentication response message, and a SUPL POS<br>
NOTIFICATION message is used as the above-mentioned<br>
positioning notification message.  *»<br>
However, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned<br>
examples, and can also be applied to other messages having<br>
the same technical scope as the present invention.<br>
Prior to describing the following preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention, it should be noted that a specific<br>
process in which a first SET requests its location<br>
information or transmits its location information to a<br><br>
18<br>
second SET will be exemplarily described for the<br>
convenience of description and better understanding of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 1A is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
FIG, 1A shows the_Non-Roaming Successful Case in which the<br>
first SET is located at the HN, and the Proxy Mode in which<br>
the first SET communicates with the SPC via the SLC.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A, the positioning system according to a<br>
first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
a first SET 100, a SLP 110, and a second SET 120.<br>
The first SET 100 is indicative of a SET for initiating the<br>
positioning service, and can communicate with the SUPL<br>
network using the SUPL protocol. The first SET 100 performs<br>
a positioning process, in which the first SET 100<br>
communicates with the SLP 110- acting as a server, to<br>
implement the positioning service, and acquires its location<br>
information.<br>
The SLP 110 is a server acting as a network element capable<br>
of accessing/employing network resources, and is indicative<br>
of a SUPL SAP (Service Access Point) of a network. The SLP<br>
110 may include the SPC serving as an entity for calculating<br>
location information of the first SET 100, and the SLC<br>
serving as an entity for managing overall SUPL protocols<br><br>
19<br>
(e.g., SUPL session management, Roaming, and Resource<br>
Management, etc.).<br>
The second SET 120 is a SET desired by the first SET 100 as<br>
a destination of the first SET 100's location information,<br>
and is a terminal indicating a logical SAP (Service Access<br>
Point) for employing the first SET 100's location<br>
information received .from the SLP 110. In this case, the<br>
second SET 120 is a terminal which can communicate with the<br>
SUPL network using the SUPL protocol in the same manner as<br>
in the first SET 100.<br>
For example, each of the first SET 100 and the second SET<br>
120 is a User Terminal (UT) for use in a Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication System (UMTS), a Mobile Station (MS) for<br>
use in a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) or an<br>
IS-95, or a notebook computer and Personal Digital Assistant<br>
(PDA) for supporting the SUPL protocol.<br>
A method for allowing' the first SET 100 to acqaire its<br>
location information using the SUPL protocol in the<br>
positioning system, or allowing the first SET 100 to<br>
transmit its location information to the second SET 120<br>
according to the first preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
The SLP 110 associated with a positioning procedure<br>
transmits the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message to the second<br>
SET 120 to inform the second SET 120 of the first SET 100' s<br><br>
20<br>
location information.<br>
In this case, the SUPL START message firstly transmitted<br>
from the first SET 100 to the SLP 110 may include notified<br>
SET-id information indicating a second SET ID, MO (Mobile<br>
Originated location request) mode information, and AC'K<br>
(Acknowledgement) mode information.<br>
The first SET 100 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S100.<br>
After executing the data link connection, the first SET 100<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the SLP 110, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure at step S101. In<br>
this case, the SUPL START message may include session-id<br>
information, lid information, qop information, SET<br>
capability information, notified SET-id information, MO mode<br>
information, and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
The notified SET-id information • is indicative' or£&gt; ID<br>
information of a second SET at which the first SET's<br>
location information is to be received. The MO mode<br>
information is indicative of mode information of a SET for<br>
initiating the first SET's location information request<br>
action. The HO mode information may include specific<br>
information indicating a first type (Type 1) or a second<br>
type (Type 2).<br>
For example, if the MO mode information is the first type<br><br>
21<br>
(Type 1), this means that the first SET 100 desires to<br>
receive its location information, and the SUPL START message<br>
may include session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, SET capability information, and MO mode<br>
information, etc. If the MO mode information is the second<br>
type (Type 2), this means that the first SET 100 desires to<br>
transmit its location information to the second SET 120, and<br>
the SUPL START message may include session-id information,<br>
lid information, qop information, SET capability information,<br>
notified SET-id information, MO mode information, and ACK<br>
mode information, etc.<br>
The ACK mode information indicates whether there is a need<br>
for the second SET to transmit an acknowledgement signal<br>
indicating reception of the first SET's location information<br>
to the first SET,<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, the<br>
aforementioned Type-1 casein which the first SET requests<br>
the SLP to transmit location information of the first SET,<br>
and the aforementioned Type-2 case in which the first SET<br>
requests the SLP to transmit the first SET's location<br>
information to the second SET are classified according to<br>
the MO mode type information, and can also be applied to a<br>
variety of preferred embodiments shown in FIG. 2A, 3A, 4A,<br>
5A, and 7A-7C.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the above-mentioned SUPL START<br><br>
22<br>
message will hereinafter be described with reference to FIGS.<br>
11A~11C, Also, the preferred embodiment of the above-<br>
mentioned SUPL START message can also be applied to other<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from the first SET 100,<br>
the SLP 110 checks a roaming state of the first SET 100 at<br>
step S102.<br>
After checking the roaming state of the first SET 100, the<br>
SLP 110 transmits the SUPL RESPONSE message including<br>
session-id information and posmethod information, etc. to<br>
the first SET 100, such that it informs the first SET 100 of<br>
the service request permission, and also informs the first<br>
SET 100 of the beginning of the positioning procedure at<br>
step S103. The SUPL RESPONSE message will hereinafter be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 12.<br>
If the first SET 100 successfully receives the SUPL RESPONSE<br>
message from the SLP 110, it- transmits the SUPL POS INI3&gt;.<br>
message indicating the beginning of an actual positioning of<br>
the first SET 100 to the SLP 110 at step S104. The SUPL POS<br>
INIT message includes session-id information, lid<br>
information, and SET capability information, etc., and will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 13.<br>
If the SLP 110 receives the SUPL POS INIT message from the<br>
first SET 100, the SLP 110 and the first SET 100 calculate<br>
location information of the first SET 100 according to a<br><br>
23<br>
variety of location calculation methods (e.g., a SET-<br>
Assisted A-GPS method, a SET-Based A-GPS method, and a Cell-<br>
id method, etc.) based on the SUPL START-, SUPL RESPONSE-,<br>
and SUPL POS INIT- messages, and a variety of positioning<br>
protocols (GSM: RRLP, 3GPP: RRC, and 3GPP2: TIA-801) .<br>
In this case, the positioning protocol message communicated<br>
between the SLP 110 and the first SET 100 is encapsulated<br>
into the SUPL POS message, such that transmission/reception<br>
of .the SUPL POS message including the positioning protocol<br>
message is executed at step S105. The SUPL POS message<br>
includes the session-id information and RRLP/RRC/TIA-801<br>
information, and a detailed description thereof will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 14.<br>
If the location information of the first SET 100 is<br>
calculated at step S105, the SLP 110 transmits the SUPL END<br>
message to the first SET 100, such that it informs the first<br>
-•SET 100 of the end. of the SUPL -"session for the positioning<br>
service at step S106. The SUPL END message includes<br>
session-id information and posresult information indicating<br>
the positioning result, and a detailed description thereof<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 15.<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, if the<br>
MO mode information of the SUPL START message is indicative<br>
of the Type-1, the positioning procedure from the above step<br>
S100 to the above step S106 is executed. The following<br><br>
24<br>
positioning procedure relates to the Type-2 case in which<br>
the SUPL START message includes the Type-2 MO mode<br>
information.<br>
The SLP 110 transmits the first SET 100's location'<br>
information calculated by the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message<br>
including posresult information to the second SET 120 at<br>
step S107. In association . with the above-mentioned<br>
description, if there is a management server (e.g., a<br>
location server) of the second SET 120, the SLP 110 may<br>
transmit the first SET 100's location information to the<br>
management server of the second SET 120. Upon receiving the<br>
first SET 100's location information, the management server<br>
of the second SET 120 may re-transmit the first SET 100's<br>
location information to the second SET 120.<br>
In this case, the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message may use the<br>
same transmission method as that of the SUPL INIT message.<br>
In-association with the above-mentioned description, it<br>
should be noted that the SLP 110 may transmit the first SET<br>
100's location information calculated by any one of a<br>
variety of messages (i.e., a MLP SLR (Mobile Location<br>
Protocol Standard Location Report) message, WAP PUSH, a SMS<br>
message, TCP/IP connection, and UDP/IP connection) to the<br>
second SET 120 as necessary.<br>
A method for allowing the SLC 211 to transmit the first SET<br>
200' s location information to the second SET 220 can also be<br><br>
25<br>
applied to other preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A detailed description of the above-mentioned SUPL INIT<br>
message will be described with reference to FIG, 10.<br>
In the case where the first SET 100 requests the second SET<br>
120 to transmit an acknowledgement signal indicating the<br>
reception of the first SET 100's location information using<br>
the ACK mode information of the SUPL START message, the<br>
second .SET 120 may transmit the acknowledgement signal to<br>
the first SET 100 via the SLP 110.<br>
For example, if there is a location server for managing the<br>
second SET 120, the second SET 120 may transmit the<br>
acknowledgement signal to the location server. The above-<br>
mentioned location response message is an RRLP SSRP message<br>
including an acknowledgement message, and may inform the SLP<br>
110 of the transmission result of the first SET 100's<br>
location information.<br>
The above-mentioned location information transmission<br>
process has been disclosed for only illustrative purposes,<br>
and the sequence of the location information transmission<br>
may be modified as necessary.<br>
FIG. IB is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a second<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Compared with the location information transmission method<br><br>
26<br>
shown in FIG, 1A, only information contained in the SUPL<br>
START message at step S101 (during which the first SET 100<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the SLP 110) of FIG. IB<br>
is different from that of FIG. 1A. Therefore, only the step<br>
S101 of FIG. IB will be described for the convenience of<br>
description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIG. 1A can also be applied to the<br>
preferred embodiment of FIG. IB.<br>
The first SET 100 transmits the SUPL START message to the<br>
SLP 110 to initiate the positioning procedure. In this case,<br>
the first SET 100 requests the SLP 110 to transmit location<br>
information of the second SET 120, or requests the SLP 110<br>
to transmit the first SET 100's location information to the<br>
second SET '120 at step S101. For the above-mentioned<br>
request operations, the SUPL START message may include<br>
sessionid information, lid information, qop information,<br>
SET capability information, SET ID information, and ACK mode<br>
information, etc. In this case, the SET ID information may<br>
be an ID of a target SET desired by a start SET initiating<br>
the positioning procedure such that the target SET can<br>
acquire the start SET's location information, or may be an<br>
ID of a third party desired by the start SET as a<br>
destination of the start SET's location information.<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, the ID<br><br>
27<br>
of the target SET may be represented by a "Target SET ID",<br>
and the ID of the third party may be represented by a "Third<br>
Party ID".<br>
For example, if the SET initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 100 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 100 is the second SET 120, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 120's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET 100 and the third party is<br>
desired by the first SET 100 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 100's location information, the third party<br>
ID may be the second SET 120's ID.<br>
FIG. 2A is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a third<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
FIG. 2A shows the Non-Roaming Successful Case in which the<br>
first SET is located at the HN, and the Proxy Mode in which<br>
the first-vSET directly communicates with the SPC.<br>
Compared with the positioning system shown in FIG. 1A, the<br>
positioning system shown in FIG. 2A according to a third<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a<br>
first SET 200, a SLP 210, and a second SET 220. Differently<br>
from the positioning system of FIG. 1A, the positioning<br>
system of FIG. 2A includes a SLC 211 and a SPC 212 in the<br>
SLP 210. In this case, the SPC 212 is an entity for<br>
calculating location information of the first SET 200 acting<br><br>
28<br>
as a positioning target terminal, and the SLC 211 is an<br>
entity for managing overall SUPL protocols (e.g., SUPL<br>
session management, Roaming, and Resource Management, etc.).<br>
The first SET 200 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S200.<br>
After executing the data link connection, -the first SET 200<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the SLC 211, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure. In this case, the<br>
first SET 200 may request the first SET 200's location<br>
information from the SLC 211, or may request the SLC 211 to<br>
transmit the first SET 200's location information to the<br>
second SET 220 at step S201. For the above-mentioned<br>
request operations, the SUPL START message may include<br>
session-id information, lid information, qop information,<br>
SET capability information, notified SET-id information<br>
indicating an ID -of a second SET at which" the first SET<br>
200's location information is to be received, MO mode<br>
information, and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from the first SET 200,<br>
the SLC 211 checks a roaming state of the first SET 200 at<br>
step S202.<br>
After checking the roaming state of the first SET 200, the<br>
SLC 211 creates session-id information to be used for the<br>
session associated with the first SET 200, transmits the<br><br>
29<br>
created session-id information, first SET-id information, a<br>
location calculation method, and positioning protocol<br>
information, etc. to the SPC 212, and indicates that a<br>
positioning session associated with the first SET 200 will<br>
begin at step S203.<br>
The SLC 211 transmits the SUPL RESPONSE message to the first<br>
SET 200, such that it informs the . first SEX. 200 of the<br>
service request permission, and informs the first SET 200 of<br>
the beginning of the positioning session at step S204. The<br>
SUPL RESPONSE message may include session-id information,<br>
SPC-address information, SET auth-key information, and key-<br>
id 4 information, etc. In this case, in order to command<br>
the first SET 200 to start the positioning session<br>
associated with the SPC 212, the SLC 211 may include the SPC<br>
address information in the SUPL RESPONSE message, and may<br>
transmit the resultant SUPL RESPONSE message including the<br>
SPC address information to the first SET 200. ~<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL RESPONSE message including the SPC<br>
212's address information from the SLC 211, the first SET<br>
200 releases connection to the SLC 211, and transmits the<br>
SUPL POS INIT message to the SPC 212, such that it starts an<br>
actual positioning session of the first SET 200. In this<br>
case, if the SPC 212 receives the SUPL POS INIT message from<br>
the first SET 200, it informs the SLC 211 of the beginning<br>
of the positioning session associated with the first SET 200<br><br>
30<br>
at step S205.<br>
The SPC 212 and the first SET 200 calculate location<br>
information of the first SET 200 according to a variety of<br>
location calculation methods (e.g., a SET-Assisted A-GPS<br>
method, a SET-Based A-GPS method, and a Cell-id method,<br>
etc.) and a variety of positioning protocols (GSM: RRLP,<br>
3GPP: RRC, and 3GPP2: TIA-T301). In this	case, the<br>
positioning protocol message communicated between the SPC<br>
212 and the first SET 200 is encapsulated into the SUPL POS<br>
message, such that transmission/reception of the SUPL POS<br>
message including the positioning protocol message is<br>
executed at step S206.<br>
If the location information of the first SET 200 is<br>
calculated at step S206, the SPC 212 transmits the SUPL END<br>
message to the first SET 200, such that it informs the first<br>
SET 200 of the end of the SUPL session for the positioning<br>
service, and the«*first' SET 200 releases connection to the<br>
SPC 212. The SPC 212 informs the SLC 211 of a SUPL session<br>
termination, and transmits the calculated location<br>
information to the SLC 211 at step S207.<br>
The SLC 211 transmits the first SET 200's location<br>
information calculated by the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message<br>
to the second SET 220. In this case, the SUPL POS<br>
NOTIFICATION message may use the same transmission method as<br>
that of the SUPL INIT measage. In addition, a method for<br><br>
31<br>
controlling the SLC 211 to transmit the calculated first<br>
SET'S location information to the second SET 220 can also be<br>
applied to the transmission methods of FIG. 1A.<br>
FIG. 2B is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a fourth<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Compared with the location information transmission, method<br>
shown in FIG. 2A, only information contained in the SUPL<br>
START message at step S201 (during which the first SET 200<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the SLC 211) of FIG. 2B<br>
is different from that of FIG. 2A. Therefore, only the step<br>
S201 of FIG. 2B will be described for the convenience of<br>
description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIG. 2A can also be applied to the<br>
preferred embodiment of FIG. 2B.<br>
The first SET 200 transmits the SUPL START message- to the<br>
SLC 211 to initiate the positioning procedure. In this case,<br>
the first SET 200 requests the SLP 210 to transmit location<br>
information of the second SET 220, or requests the SLP 210<br>
to transmit the first SET 200's location information to the<br>
second SET 220 at step S201. For the above-mentioned<br>
request operations, the SUPL START message may include<br>
session-id information, lid information, qop information,<br>
SET capability information, SET ID information, and ACK mode<br><br>
32<br>
information, etc.<br>
For example, if the SET initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 200 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 200 is the second SET 220, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 220's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET 200 and the third party is<br>
desired by the first SET 200 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 200's location information, the third party<br>
ID may be the second SET 220's ID.<br>
FIG. 3A is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a fifth<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
FIG. 3A shows the Roaming Successful Case in which the first<br>
SET is located at the VN instead of the HN and the V-SLP<br>
performs the positioning procedure, and the Proxy Mode in<br>
which the first SET communicates with the SPC via the SLC<br>
and the V-SLP performstshe positioning procedure.<br>
The positioning system of FIG. 3A includes a first SET 300<br>
acting as a positioning target terminal, a H-SLP 310 acting<br>
as a HN server, a V-SLP 320 acting as a VN server, a N-SLP<br>
330 located at the second SET 340's network, and a second<br>
SET 340 for receiving the first SET 300's location<br>
information. In this case, the server located at the second<br>
SET 340's network is defined as the N-SLP 330. It is<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art that the server located<br><br>
33<br>
at the second SET 340's network is defined as the N-SLP 330,<br>
and the N-SLP 330 acting as a logical entity may be equal to<br>
the H-SLP 310.<br>
The first SET 300 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S300.<br>
After executing the data link connection, the first SET-300<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 310, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure. In this case, the<br>
first SET 300 may request the first SET 300's location<br>
information from the H-SLP 310, or may request the H-SLP 310<br>
to transmit the first SET 300's location information to the<br>
second SET 340 at step S301. For the above-mentioned<br>
request operations, the SUPL START message may include<br>
session-id information, lid information, qop information,<br>
SET capability information, notified SET-id information<br>
indicating an ID of the recond SET at which the first SET<br>
300's location information is to be received, MO mode<br>
information, and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from the first SET 300,<br>
the H-SLP 310 checks a roaming state of the first SET 300 at<br>
step S302.<br>
Thereafter, the H-SLP 310 allows the SUPL START message<br>
(including session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, SET capability information, notified SET-id<br><br>
34<br>
information, MO mode information, and ACK mode information,<br>
etc.) to be encapsulated into an RLP SSRLIR (Roaming<br>
Location Protocol Standard SUPL Roaming Location Immediate<br>
Request) message, and performs tunneling to the V-SLP 320 at<br>
step S303, such that the H-SLP 310 can calculate the first<br>
SET 300's location information via the V-SLP 320.<br>
The V-SLP 320 permits the SUPL session request, and controls<br>
the SUPL RESPONSE message (including session-id information<br>
and V-SLP address information, -etc.) to be encapsulated into<br>
an RLP SSRLIA (Roaming Location Protocol Standard SUPL<br>
Roaming Location Immediate Answer) message, and performs<br>
tunneling to the H-SLP 320 at step S304.<br>
The H-SLP 310 performs de-capsulation of the RLP SSRLIA<br>
message received from the V-SLP 320, and transmits the SUPL<br>
RESPONSE message (including the session-id information,<br>
etc.) to the first SET 300. In this case, the H-SLP 310 may<br>
not include the V-SLP address in. the SUPL RESPONSE message,~<br>
such that the first SET 300 can communicate with the V-SLP<br>
320 via the H-SLP 310.<br>
If the first SET 300 successfully receives the SUPL RESPONSE<br>
message from the H-SLP 310, it informs the H-SLP 310 of the<br>
beginning of an actual positioning operation, and transmits<br>
the SUPL POS INIT message (including session-id information,<br>
lid information, and SET capability information, etc.) to<br>
the H-SLP 310 at step S306.<br><br>
35<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL POS INIT message from the first SET<br>
300, the H-SLP performs tunneling of the SUPL POS INIT<br>
message to the V-5LP 320 at step S307.<br>
Upon receiving the RLP SSRP message including the SUPL POS<br>
INIT message, the V-SLP 320 and the first SET 300 calculate<br>
a location of the first SET 300 according to a variety of<br>
location calculation methods (e.g., a SET-Assisted A-GPS.<br>
method, a SET-Based A-GPS method, and a Cell-id method,<br>
etc.) and a variety of positioning protocols (GSM: RRLP,<br>
3GPP: RRC, and 3GPP2: TIA-801), and acquire location<br>
information of the first SET 300 at step S308. In this case,<br>
the message communicated between the V-SLP 320 and the first<br>
SET 300 is transmitted/received via the H-SLP 310.<br>
If the first SET 300's location information is calculated<br>
and acquired at step S308, the V-SLP 320 transmits the SUPL<br>
END message (including session-id information and posresult<br>
information) to the H-SLP 310'=via . the RLP SSRP message at <br>
step S309.<br>
The H-SLP 310 performs de-capsulation of the RLP SSRP<br>
message to acquire the SUPL END message, and transmits the<br>
SUPL END message to the first SET 300, such that it informs<br>
the first SET 300 of the end of the SUPL session for the<br>
positioning service at step S310. The first SET 300<br>
releases connection to the H-SLP 310 at step S310.<br>
A first case in which the H-SLP 310 is equal to the N-SLP<br><br>
36<br>
330 and a second case in which the H-SLP 310 is different<br>
from the N-SLP 330 include different processing from S310,<br>
and detailed descriptions of the first and second cases will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
If the H-SLP 310 is different from the N-SLP 330, the H-SLP<br>
310 encapsulates the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message equipped<br>
wiih the calculated location information (posresult) into<br>
the RLP SSRP message, and performs tunneling to the N-SLP<br>
330 at step 5311.<br>
The N-SLP 330 performs de-capsulation of the received RLP<br>
SSRP message, and transmits the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION<br>
message including the calculated location information<br>
(posresult) to the second SET 340 at step S312. In this<br>
case, the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message may use the same<br>
transmission method as that of the SUPL INIT message, and it<br>
is obvious to those skilled in the art that other examples<br>
including the calculated locati«sm information (posresult)<br>
may also be used as the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message.<br>
However, if the H-SLP 310 is equal to the N-SLP 330, the H-<br>
SLP 310 may transmit the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message<br>
including the calculated location information (posresult) to<br>
the second SET 340,<br>
FIG. 3B is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a sixth<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
37<br>
Compared with the location information transmission method<br>
shown in FIG. 3A, only information contained in the SUPL<br>
START message at step S301 (during which the first SET 300<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 310) of FIG.<br>
3B is different from that of FIG. 3A. Therefore, only the<br>
step S301 of FIG. 3B will be described for the convenience<br>
.of description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art<br>
that a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIG. 3A can also be applied to the<br>
preferred embodiment of FIG. 3B.<br>
The' first SET 300 transmits the SUPL START message to the H-<br>
SLP 310 to initiate the positioning procedure. In this case,<br>
the first SET 300 requests the H-SLP 310 to transmit<br>
location information of the second SET 340, or requests the<br>
H-SLP 310 to transmit the first SET 300's location<br>
information to the second SET 340 at step S301. For the<br>
above-mentioned request operations,the. SUPL START message<br>
may include session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, SET capability information, SET ID information,<br>
and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
For example, if the SET initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 300 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 300 is the second SET 340, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 340's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET 300 and the third party is<br><br>
38<br>
desired by the first SET 300 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 300's location information, the third party<br>
ID may be the second SET 340's ID.<br>
FIG. 4A is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a seventh<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
FIG. 42L„shows the Roaming Successful Case in which the first<br>
SET is located at the VN instead of the HN and the V-SPC<br>
performs the positioning procedure, and -the Non-Proxy Mode<br>
in which the first SET directly communicates with the SPC<br>
and the V-SPC performs the positioning procedure.<br>
The positioning system of FIG. 4A includes a first SET 400<br>
acting as a positioning target terminal, a V-SLP 410 acting<br>
as a VN server, a H-SLP 420 acting as a HN server, a N-SLP<br>
430 located at the second SET 44 0's network, and a second<br>
SET 440 for receiving the first SET 400's location<br>
information. In this-case, the V-SLP 410 may include the V-<br>
SPC 412 for calculating location information of the first<br>
SET 400 acting as the positioning target terminal; and a V-<br>
SIC 411 for managing overall SUPL protocols (e.g., SUPL<br>
session management, Roaming, and Resource Management, etc.).<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, the<br>
server located at the second SET 440's network is defined as<br>
the N-SLP 430, but the N-SLP 430 acting as a logical entity<br>
may be equal to or different from the H-SLP 420.<br><br>
39<br>
The first SET 400 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S400.<br>
After executing the data link connection, the first SET 400<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 420, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure. In this case, the<br>
first. SET.... 400 may request the first SET 400' s location<br>
information from the H-SLP 420, or may request the H-SLP 420<br>
to transmit the first SET 400rs location information to the<br>
second SET 440 at step S401. For the above-mentioned<br>
request operations, the SUPL START message may include<br>
session-id information, lid information, qop information,<br>
SET capability information, notified SET-id information<br>
indicating an ID of the second SET at which the first SET<br>
400rs location information is to be received, MO mode<br>
information, and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from- the first SET 400,<br>
the H-SLP 420 checks a roaming state of the first SET 400 at<br>
step S402.<br>
Thereafter, the H-SLP 420 allows the SUPL START message<br>
(including session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, and SET capability information, etc.) to be<br>
encapsulated into an RLP SSRLIR message, and performs<br>
tunneling to the V-SLC 411 at step S403, such that the H-SLP<br>
420 can calculate the first SET 400's location information<br><br>
40<br>
via the V-SLC 411.<br>
The V-SLC 411 permits the SUPL session request, and assigns<br>
the session-id to be used for the session associated with<br>
the first SET 400. Also, the V-SLC 411 transmits the<br>
assigned session-id information, the first SET's information,<br>
location calculation method information, and positioning<br>
protocol information to the V-SPC 412, and informs the V-SPC<br>
412 of the beginning of the positioning session associated<br>
with the first SET 400 at step S404.<br>
The V-SLC 411 encapsulates the SUPL RESPONSE message<br>
(including the session-id information, and the V-SLP address,<br>
etc.) into the RLP SSRLIA message, and performs tunneling to<br>
the H-SLP 420. In this case, the V-SLC 411 includes the V-<br>
SPC address .in the SUPL RESPONSE message, such that the<br>
first SET 400 can establish the positioning session<br>
associated with the V-SPC 412 at step S405.<br>
The H-SLP 420 generates an authentication-associated key to<br>
be used for the session between the V-SPC 412 and the first<br>
SET 400, encapsulates the SUPL AUTH RESP message (including<br>
session-id information, SPC auth-key information, and key-id<br>
3 information, etc.) into the RLP SSRP message, and<br>
transmits the encapsulation-associated information to the V-<br>
SLC 411 at step S406.<br>
The H-SLP 420 performs de-capsulation of the RLP SSRLIA<br>
message, which has been received from the V-SLC 411 at step<br><br>
41<br>
S405, and transmits the SUPL RESPONSE message (including the<br>
session-id information, V-SPC address information, SET auth-<br>
key information, and key-id 4 information, etc.) to the<br>
first SET 400 at step S407. The SUPL RESPONSE message may<br>
include V-SPC address and authentication-associated key<br>
information at step S407.<br>
If the first SET.. 400 successfully receives the SUPL RESPONSE<br>
message from the H-SLP 420, it releases connection to the H-<br>
SLP 420, and establishes a positioning session connected to<br>
the V-SPC 412 using the received information. The first SET<br>
400 transmits the SUPL POS INIT message (including session-<br>
id information, lid information, and SET capability<br>
information, etc.) indicating the beginning of the<br>
positioning process to the V-SPC 412. Upon receiving the<br>
SUPL POS INIT message from the first SET 400, the V-SPC 412<br>
informs the first SET 4 00 of the beginning of the<br>
positioning session associated with the first SET 400 at<br>
step S408.<br>
If the SUPL POS INIT message is received in the V-SPC 412<br>
and the first SET 400, the V-SPC 412 and the first SET 400<br>
calculate a location of the first SET 400 according to a<br>
variety of location calculation methods (e.g., a SET-<br>
Assisted A-GPS method, a SET-Based A-GPS method, and a Cell-<br>
id method, etc.) and a variety of positioning protocols<br>
(GSM: RRLP, 3GPP: RRC, and 3GPP2: TIA-801), and acquire<br><br>
42<br>
location Information of the first SET 400 at step S409. In<br>
this case, the positioning protocol message communicated<br>
between the V-SPC 412 and the first SET 400 is encapsulated<br>
into the SUPL POS message, such that transmission/reception<br>
of the SUPL POS message including the positioning protocol<br>
message is executed.<br>
If the first SET	400's location information is calculated<br>
and acquired at step S409, the V-SPC 412 transmits the SUPL<br>
END message (including session-id information and posresult<br>
information) to the first SET 400, and the first SET 400<br>
releases connection to the V-SPC 412 at step S410.<br>
The V-SPC 412 transmits the calculated first SET 400's<br>
location information to the V-SLC 411, and informs the V-SLC<br>
411 of the end of the SUPL session at step S411.<br>
Upon receiving the calculated first SET 400's location<br>
information from the V-SPC 412, the V-SLC 411 performs<br>
tunneling of the S6JPL END message (including the=*»sessron-id<br>
information and the calculated location information<br>
(posresult)) to the H-SCLP 420 using the RLP SSRP message at<br>
step S412.<br>
A first case in which the H-SLP 420 is equal to the N-SLP<br>
430 and a second case in which the H-SLP 420 is different<br>
from the N-SLP 430 include different processing from S412,<br>
and detailed descriptions of the first and second cases will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br><br>
43<br>
If the H-SLP 420 is different from the N-SLP 430, the H-SLP<br>
420 encapsulates the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message equipped<br>
with the calculated location information (posresult) into<br>
the RLP SSRP message, and performs tunneling to the N-SLP<br>
430 at step S413.<br>
The N-SLP 430 performs de-capsulation of the received RLP<br>
SSRP message, and_._transmits the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION<br>
message including the calculated location information<br>
(posresult) to the second SET 440 at step S414. In this<br>
case, the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message may use the same<br>
transmission method as that of the SUPL INIT message, and it<br>
is obvious to those skilled in the art that other examples<br>
including the calculated location information (posresult)<br>
may also be used as the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message.<br>
However, if the H-SLP 420 is equal to the N-SLP 430, the H-<br>
SLP 420 may transmit the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message<br>
including the calculated location information (posresult)'to<br>
the second SET 440.<br>
FIG. 4B is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to an eighth<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Compared with the location information transmission method<br>
shown in FIG. 4A, only information contained in the SUPL<br>
START message at step S401 (during which the first SET 400<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 420) of FIG.<br><br>
44<br>
4B is different from that of FIG, 4A, Therefore, only the<br>
step S401 of FIG. 4B will be described for the convenience<br>
of description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art<br>
that a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIG. 4A can also be applied to the<br>
preferred embodiment of FIG. 4B.<br>
The first SET.400 transmits the SUPL START message to the H-<br>
SLP 420 to initiate the positioning procedure. In this case,<br>
the first SET 400 requests the H-SLP 420 to transmit<br>
location information of the second SET 440, or requests the<br>
H-SLP 420 to transmit the first SET 400's location<br>
information to the second SET 440 at step S401. For the<br>
above-mentioned request operations, the SUPL START message<br>
may include session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, SET capability information, SET ID information,<br>
and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
For example, if the SET "initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 400 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 400 is the second SET 440, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 440's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET 400 and the third party is<br>
desired by the first SET 400 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 400's location information, the third party<br>
ID may be the second SET 440's ID.<br>
FIG. 5A is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br><br>
45<br>
transmitting location information according to a ninth<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,.<br>
FIG. 5A shows the Roaming Successful Case in which the first<br>
SET is located at the VN instead of the HN and the V-SPC<br>
performs the positioning procedure, and the Non-Proxy Mode<br>
in which the first SET directly communicates with the SPC<br>
and the V-SPC performs the_positioning procedure.<br>
'The positioning system of FIG. 5A includes a first SET 500<br>
acting as a positioning target terminal, a H-SLP 510 acting<br>
as a HN server, a V-SLP 520 acting as a VN server, a N-SLP<br>
530 located at the second SET 540's network, and a second<br>
SET 540 for receiving the first SET 500's location<br>
information.<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, the<br>
server located at the second SET 540's network is defined as<br>
the N-SLP 530, but the N-SLP 530 acting as a logical entity<br>
may be equal to or different from the HSLP 510.<br>
The first SET 500 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S500.<br>
After executing the data link connection, the first SET 500<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 510, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure. In this case, the<br>
first SET 500 may request the first SET 500's location<br>
information from the H-SLP 510, or may request the H-SLP 510<br><br>
46<br>
to transmit the first SET 500's location information to the<br>
second SET 540. For the above-mentioned request operations,<br>
the SUPL START message may include session-id information,<br>
lid information, qop information, SET capability information,<br>
notified SET-id information indicating an ID of the second<br>
SET at which the first SET 500's location information is to<br>
be received, MO mode information, and ACK mode information,<br>
etc. at step S501.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from the first SET 500,<br>
the H-SLP 510 checks a roaming state of the first SET 500 at<br>
step S502.<br>
Thereafter, the H-SLP 510 executes the positioning session,<br>
and transmits an RLP SRLIR (Roaming Location Protocol<br>
Standard Roaming Location Immediate Request) message<br>
(including session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, and SET capability information, etc.) to the V-<br>
SLP 520 at step S503, such that it can request uncalculated<br>
first SET 500's location information from the V-SLP 520.<br>
The V-SLP 520 transmits the uncalculated location<br>
information to the H-SLP 510 via the RLP SRLIA (Roaming<br>
Location Protocol Standard Roaming Location Immediate<br>
Answer) message at step S504.<br>
The H-SLP 510 transmits the SUPL RESPONSE message (including<br>
the session-id information, etc.) to the first SET 500, such<br>
that it informs the first SET 500 of the service request<br><br>
47<br>
permission, and also informs the first SET 500 of the<br>
beginning of the positioning procedure at step S505,<br>
If the first SET 500 successfully receives the SUPL RESPONSE<br>
message from the H-SLP 510, it transmits the SUPL POS INIT<br>
message (including session-id information, lid information,<br>
and SET capability information, etc.) indicating the<br>
beginning of an actual positioning of the first SET 500 to<br>
the H-SLP 510 at step S506.<br>
If. the H-SLP 510 receives the SUPL POS INIT message from the<br>
first SET 500, the H-SLP 510 and the first SET 500 calculate<br>
location information of the first SET 500 according to a<br>
variety of location calculation methods (e.g., a SET-<br>
Assisted A-GPS method, a SET-Based A-GPS method, and a Cell-<br>

and SUPL POS INIT- messages, and a variety of positioning<br>
protocols (GSM: RRLP, 3GPP: RRC, and 3GPP2: TIA-801) at step<br>
6507.<br>
In this case, the positioning protocol message communicated<br>
between the H-SLP 510 and the first SET 500 is encapsulated<br>
into the SUPL POS message, such that transmission/reception<br>
of the SUPL POS message including the positioning protocol<br>
message is executed at step S507.<br>
If the location information of the first SET 500 is<br>
calculated and acquired at step S507, the H-SLP 510<br>
transmits the SUPL END message (including session-id<br><br>
48<br>
information and posresult information) to the first SET 500,<br>
such that it informs the first SET 500 of the end of the<br>
SUPL session for the positioning service at step S508, such<br>
that the first SET 500 releases connection to the H-SLP 510<br>
at step S508.<br>
A first case in which the H-SLP 510 is equal to the N-SLP<br>

49<br>
However, if the H-SLP 510 is equal to the N-SLP 530, the H-<br>

FIG. 5B is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a, 10-th<br>
preferred embodiment of the. present	invention.<br>
Compared with the location information transmission method<br>
shown in FIG. 5A, only information contained in the SUPL<br>
START message at step S501 (during which the first SET 500<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 510) of FIG.<br>
5B is different from that of FIG. 5A. Therefore, only the<br>
step S501 of FIG. 5B will be described for the convenience<br>
of description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art<br>
that a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIG. 5A can also be applied to the<br>
preferred embodiment of FIG. 5B.<br>
The first SET 500 transmits the SUPL START message to the H-<br>
SLP 510 to initiate the positioning procedure. In this case,<br>
the first SET 500 requests the H-SLP 510 to transmit<br>
location information of the second SET 540, or requests the<br>
H-SLP 510 to transmit the first SET 500's location<br>
information to the second SET 540 at step S501. For the<br>
above-mentioned request operations, the SUPL START message<br>
may include session-id information, lid information, qop<br><br>
50<br>
information, SET capability information, SET ID information,<br>
and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
For example, if the SET initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 500 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 500 is the second SET 540, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 540's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET. 500 and- the third party is<br>
desired by the first SET 500 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 500's location information, the third party<br>
ID may be the second SET 540's ID.<br>
FIG. 6A is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to an 11-th<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
FIG. 6A shows the Roaming Successful Case in which the first<br>
SET is located at the VN instead of the HN and the H-SPC<br>
performs the positioning procedure, and the Non-Proxy Mode<br>
in whiob the  first SET directly communicates with the SPC<br>
and the H-SPC performs the positioning procedure.<br>
The positioning system of FIG. 6A includes a first SET 600<br>
acting as a positioning target terminal, a H-S1P 610 acting<br>
as a HN server, a V-SLP 620 acting as a VN server, a N-SLP<br>
630 located at the second SET 640's network, and a second<br>
SET 640 for receiving the first SET 600's location<br>
information. In this case, the H-SLP 610 may include a H-<br>
SPC 612 for calculating location information of the first<br><br>
51 .<br>
SET 600 acting as the positioning target terminal; and a H-<br>
SLC 611 for managing overall SUPL protocols (e.g., SUPL<br>
session management, Roaming, and Resource Management, etc.).<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, the<br>
server located at the second SET 640's network is defined as<br>
the N-SLP 630, but the N-SLP 630 acting as a logical entity<br>
may be equal to or different from the H.--SLP 610.<br>
The first SET 600 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S600.<br>
After executing the data link setup, the first SET 600<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLC 611, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure.<br>
In this case, the first SET 600 may request the first SET<br>
600's location information from the H-SLC 611, or may<br>
request the H-SLC 611 to transmit the first SET 600's<br>
location dmformation to the second SET 640 at step S601.<br>
For the above-mentioned request operations, the SUPL START<br>
message may include session-id information, lid information,<br>
qop information, SET capability information, notified SET-id<br>
information indicating an ID of the second SET at which the<br>
first SET 600's location information is to be received, MO<br>
mode information, and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from the first SET 600,<br>
the H-SLC 611 checks a roaming state of the first SET 600 at<br><br>
52<br>
step S602.<br>
Thereafter, the H-SLC 611 transmits an RLP SRLIR message<br>
(including msid information and lid information, etc.) to<br>
the V-SLP 620 at step S603, such that the H-SPC 612 can<br>
execute the positioning session and can request uncalculated<br>
location information from the V-SLP 620.<br>
Upon receiving the RLP SRLIR .message.,	the V-SLP 620<br>
transmits the uncalculated location information to the H-SLC<br>
611 via the RLP.SRLIA message at step S604.<br>
The H-SLC 611 creates session-id information to be used for<br>
the session associated with the first SET 600, transmits the<br>
created session-id information, the uncalculated first SET-<br>
id information, location calculation method information, and<br>
positioning protocol information, etc. to the H-SPC 612, and<br>
indicates that a positioning session associated with the<br>
first SET 600 will begin at step S605.<br>
The H-SLC 61fr&gt;'transmits the SUPL RESPONSE message (including<br>
session-id information, H-SPC address information, set auth-<br>
key information, and key-id 4, etc.) to the first SET 600,<br>
such that it informs the first SET 600 of the service<br>
request permission, and also informs the first SET 600 of<br>
the beginning of the positioning session. In other words,<br>
in order to command the first SET 600 to initiate the<br>
positioning session along with the H-SPC 612, the H-SLC 611<br>
includes the H-SPC address information in the SUPL RESPONSE<br><br>
53<br>
message, and transmits the SUPL RESPONSE message including<br>
the H-SPC address information at step S606.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL RESPONSE message including the H-SPC<br>
address information from the H-SLC 611, the first SET .600<br>
releases connection to the H-SLC 611, and transmits the SUPL<br>
POS INIT message (including session-id information, lid<br>
information, and SET capability information, ate.) to the H-<br>
SPC 612, such that it informs the H-SPC 612 of the beginning<br>
of an actual positioning session. In this case, the H-SPC<br>
612 informs the H-SLC 611 of the beginning of the<br>
positioning session associated with the first SET 600 at<br>
step S607.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL POS INIT message, the H-SPC 612 and<br>
the first SET 600 calculate a location of the first SET 600<br>
according to a variety of location calculation methods (e.g.,<br>
a SET-Assisted A-GPS method, a SET-Based A-GPS method, and a<br>
Cell-ID method,*»-etc.)'and a variety of positioning protocols<br>
(GSM: RRLP, 3GPP: RRC, and 3GPP2: TIA-801), and acquire<br>
location information of the first SET 600 at step S608, In<br>
this case, the positioning protocol message communicated<br>
between the H-SPC 612 and the first SET 600 is encapsulated<br>
into the SUPL POS message, such that the SUPL POS message<br>
including the positioning protocol message is<br>
transmitted/received.<br>
If the first SET 600's location information is calculated<br><br>
54<br>
and acquired at step S608, the H-SPC 612 transmits the SUPL<br>
END message (including session-id information and posresult<br>
information) to the first SET 600, such that it informs the<br>
first SET 600 of the end of the SUPL session for the<br>
positioning service at step S609.<br>
A first case in which the H-SLP 610 is equal to the N-SLP<br>
630 and a second case in which the H-SLP 610 is., different<br>
from the N-SLP 630 include different processing from S609,<br>
and detailed descriptions of the first and second cases will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
If the H-SLP 610 is different from the N-SLP 630, the H-SLP<br>
610 encapsulates the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message equipped<br>
with the calculated location information (posresult) into<br>
the RLP SSRP message, and performs tunneling to the N-SLP<br>
630 at step 5610.<br>
The N-SLP 630 performs de-capsulation of the received RLP<br>
SSRP message, and transmits the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION<br>
message including the calculated location information<br>
(posresult) to the second SET 640 at step S611. In this<br>
case, the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message may use the same<br>
transmission method as that of the SUPL INIT message, and it<br>
is obvious to those skilled in the art that other examples<br>
including the calculated location information (posresult)<br>
may also be used as the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message.<br>
However, if the H-SLP 610 is equal to the N-SLP 630, the H-<br><br>
55<br>
SLP 610 may transmit the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message<br>
including the calculated location information (posresult) to<br>
the second SET 640.<br>
FIG. 6B is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to a 12-th<br>
preferred embodiment of .the present invention.<br>
Compared with the location information transmission method<br>
shown in FIG. 6A, only information contained in the SUPL<br>
START message at step S601 (during which the first SET 600<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLC 611) of FIG.<br>
6B is different from that of FIG. 6A. Therefore, only the<br>
step S601 of FIG. 6B will be described for the convenience<br>
of description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art<br>
that a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIG. 6A can also be applied to the<br>
preferred embodiment of FIG. 6B.<br>
The first SET 600 tpjmsmits the SUPL START message to* the H-<br>
SLC 611 to initiate the positioning procedure. In this case,<br>
the first SET 600 requests the H-SLP 610 to transmit<br>
location information of the second SET 640, or requests the<br>
H-SLP 610 to transmit the first SET 600' s location<br>
information to the second SET 640 at step S601. For the<br>
above-mentioned request operations, the SUPL START message<br>
may include session-id information, lid information, qop<br>
information, SET capability information, SET ID information,<br><br>
56<br>
and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
For example, if the SET initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 600 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 600 is the second SET 640, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 640's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET 600 and the third party is<br>
desired by the first SET 600 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 600's location information, the third party<br>
ID may be the second SET 6.40' s ID.<br>
FIGS. 7A~7C are conceptual diagrams illustrating a method<br>
for transmitting location information according to a 13-th<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
FIGS. 7A-7C exemplarily show a specific case in which the<br>
SUPL protocol is used between SLPs.<br>
The positioning system of FIGS. 7A-7C includes a first SET<br>
700 acting as a positioning target terminal, a H-SLP 710<br>
acting as a HN server, 
730's network, and a second SET 730 for receiving the first<br>
SET 700's location information.<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, the<br>
server located at the second SET 730's network is defined as<br>
the N-SLP 720, but the N-SLP 720 acting as a logical entity<br>
may be equal to or different from the H-SLP 710.<br>
A method for transmitting the first SET 700's location<br>
information to the second SET 730 using the SUPL protocol<br><br>
57<br>
between SLPs will hereinafter be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 7A.<br>
The first SET 700 establishes a data link connection to a<br>
mobile communication network for data communication to start<br>
the SUPL session at step S710.<br>
After executing the data link setup, the first SET 700<br>
transmits the SUPL START message to the H-SLP 710, such that<br>
it can start the positioning procedure. In this case, the<br>
first SET 700 may request, the first SET 700's location<br>
information from the H-SLP 710, or may request the H-SLP 711<br>
to transmit the first SET 700's location information to the<br>
second SET 730 at step S711. For the above-mentioned<br>
request operations, the SUPL START message may include<br>
session-id information, lid information, qop information,<br>
SET capability information, notified SET-id information<br>
indicating an ID of the second SET at which the first SET<br>
700's location information is- to be received, MO mode<br>
information, and ACK mode information, etc.<br>
In this case, if the MO mode information is the first type<br>
(Type 1), the first SET 700 may include specific information,<br>
indicating that the first SET 700 desires to transmit its<br>
location information to the second SET 730, in the SUPL<br>
START message. The ACK mode information may include<br>
specific information indicating whether there is a need for<br>
the second SET 730 to transmit an acknowledgement signal<br><br>
58<br>
indicating reception of the first SET 700's location<br>
information to the first SET 7 00.<br>
Provided that the ACK mode indicates that the second SET 730<br>
must transmit the acknowledgement signal indicating the<br>
reception of the first SET 700's location information to the<br>
 first SET 700, the second SET 730 receiving the first SET<br>
700's location information may transmit the above-mentioned.<br>
acknowledgement signal to the first SET 700.<br>
The above-mentioned acknowledgement action of the second SET<br>
730 can be executed by the following steps S718~720.<br>
Upon receiving the SUPL START message from the first SET 700,<br>
the H-SLP 710 checks a roaming state of the first SET 700<br>
and indicates whether the first SET 700 supports the SUPL<br>
protocol. The H-SLP 710 inspects a first SET 700's privacy<br>
setup associated with the first SET 700, and informs the<br>
first SET 700 that the first SET 700's location information<br>
has been transmitted to the-econd SET 730 by referring to-*<br>
the first SET 700's privacy setup.<br>
In order to protect an authorized user of the first SET 700<br>
from malicious or fraudulent application, the H-SLP 710 can<br>
transmit a notification signal, associated with transmission<br>
of location information flowing in the second SET 730, to<br>
the first SET 700, irrespective of the first SET 700's<br>
privacy setup, at step S712.<br>
The H-SLP 710 and the first SET 700 execute the SET-<br><br>
59<br>
initiated positioning procedure prescribed in the SUPL<br>
protocol at step S713.<br>
If the first SET 700's location information is calculated<br>
and acquired at step S713, the H-SLP 710 transmits the SUPL<br>
NOTIFICATION REQ message to the N-SLP 720 acting as a HN of<br>
the second SET, such that it requests the N-SLP 720 to<br>
.transmit the first SET 700's location information to the<br>
second SET 7 30.<br>
In this case, the SUPL NOTIFICATION REQ message may include<br>
session-id information, posresult information indicating the<br>
first SET 700's location information, target SET-id<br>
information indicating the first SET's ID, and notified SET-<br>
id information indicating the first SET's ID at step 714,<br>
The N-SLP 720 receives the SUPL NOTIFICATION REQ message,<br>
checks a roaming sate of the second SET 730, and determines<br>
whether the second SET 730 supports the SUPL protocol at<br>
step 715.<br>
The N-SLP 720 transmits the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message to<br>
the second SET 730, such that it starts a notification<br>
session associated with the second SET 730. In this case,<br>
the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message may include session-id<br>
information, posresult information indicating the first SET<br>
700's location information, target SET-id information<br>
indicating the first SET's ID, key-id information for<br>
authenticating the SUPL EOS NOTIFICATION message, and mac<br><br>
60<br>
information, etc. at step S716.<br>
In association with the above-mentioned description, as<br>
previously stated above," the above-mentioned SUPL POS<br>
NOTIFICATION message can be transmitted to a destination<br>
according to one of a variety of methods (e.g., WAP PUSH,<br>
and SMS Trigger, etc), such that a detailed description<br>
thereof will herein be omitted for the convenience of<br>
description.<br>
The second SET 730 receives the . SUPL POS NOTIFICATION<br>
message, and establishes a data link connection to the<br>
mobile communication network for data communication. In<br>
this case, provided that the received SUPL POS NOTIFICATION<br>
message includes key-id information and mac information, and<br>
the second SET 730 supports an authentication mechanism<br>
using the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message, the second SET 730<br>
authenticates the received SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message<br>
using the key-id information and s mac information at step<br>
S717.<br>
The second SET 730 transmits the SUPL END message to the N-<br>
SLP 720, and informs the N-SLP 720 of the processing result<br>
of the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message and the end of the<br>
notification session. In this case, if the ACK mode<br>
information of the SUPL START message indicates that there<br>
is a need for the second SET 730 to transmit an<br>
acknowledgement signal, indicating the reception of the<br><br>
61<br>
first SET 700's location information, to the first SET 700,<br>
the second SET 730 receiving the first SET 700's location<br>
information includes the acknowledgement signal in the SUPL<br>
END message, and transmits the SUPL END message including<br>
the acknowledgement signal to the N-SLP 720 at step S718.<br>
The N-SLP 720 transmits the SUPL NOTIFICATION RESP message<br>
to the H-SLP 710, such that it informs the H-SLP 710 of the<br>
processing result of the notification request and the end of<br>
the session. In this case, if the N-SLP 720 receives the<br>
acknowledgement signal from the second SET 730, it includes<br>
the acknowledgement signal into the SUPL NOTIFICATION RESP<br>
message, and transmits the SUPL NOTIFICATION RESP message<br>
including the acknowledgement signal to the H-SLP 710 at<br>
step S719.<br>
The H-SLP 710 transmits the SUPL END message to the first<br>
SET 700, and informs the first SET 700 of both its location<br>
information transmission result and the' end of the SUPL<br>
session. In this case, if the H-SLP 710 receives the<br>
acknowledgement signal from the N-SLP 720, it includes the<br>
acknowledgement signal into the SUPL END message, and<br>
transmits the SUPL END message including the acknowledgement<br>
signal to the first SET 700 at step S720.<br>
A method for transmitting the first SET 700's location<br>
information to the second SET 730 using the SUPL Roaming<br>
service of an RLP (Roaming Location Protocol) between SLPs<br><br>
62<br>
will hereinafter be described with reference to FIG. 7B,<br>
Compared with the procedures of FIG. 7A, steps S734, S738,<br>
and S739 of FIG. 7B are different from steps S714, S718, and<br>
S719 of FIG. 7A, and the remaining steps of FIG. 7B are<br>
equal to those of FIG. 7A, such that only the above-<br>
mentioned steps S734, S738, and S739 of FIG. 7B will be<br>
.described. For the convenience of description, it should be<br>
noted that step S734 is called a first step, step S738 is<br>
called a second step, and step S739 is called a third step.<br>
In the case of the first step S734, the first SET 700's<br>
location information is calculated by the SET-initiated<br>
positioning procedure. If the first SET 700's location<br>
information is acquired, the H-SLP 710 transmits the SUPL<br>
POS NOTIFICATION message to the N-SLP 720 acting as the<br>
second SET'S HN via the RLP SSRP message, and requests the<br>
N-SLP 720 to transmit the first SET 700's location<br>
information to the second SET 730.<br>
In this case, the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message may include<br>
session-id information, posresult indicating the first SET<br>
700's location information, target SET-id information<br>
indicating the first SET's ID, key-pad information for<br>
authenticating the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message, and mac<br>
information, etc.<br>
In the case of the second step S738, the second SET 730<br>
informs the N-SLP 720 of the processing result of the SUPL<br><br>
53<br>
POS NOTIFICATION message via the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP<br>
message. In this case, if the ACK mode information<br>
indicates that there is a need for the second SET 730 to<br>
transmit an acknowledgement signal, indicating the reception<br>
of the first SET 700's location information, to the first<br>
SET 700, the second SET 730 receiving the first SET 700's<br>
location information includes the acknowledgement signal in<br>
the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP message, and transmits the<br>
SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP message . including the<br>
acknowledgement signal to the N-SLP 720.<br>
In the case of the third step S739, the N-SLP 720 transmits<br>
the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP message to the H-SLP 710 via<br>
the RLP SSRP message. In this case, if the N-SLP 720<br>
receives the acknowledgement signal from the second SET 730,<br>
it includes the acknowledgement signal into the SUPL<br>
NOTIFICATION RESP message, and transmits the SUPL<br>
NOTIFICATION RESP message including t'fce acknowledgement<br>
signal to the H-SLP 710.<br>
A method for transmitting the first SET 700's location<br>
information to the second SET 730 using the Standard Roaming<br>
Location Reporting Service (SRLRC) of an RLP (Roaming<br>
Location Protocol) between SLPs will hereinafter be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 7C.<br>
Compared with the procedures of FIG. 7A, steps S7 54, S7 58,<br>
and S759 of FIG. 7C are different from steps S714, S718, and<br><br>
64<br>
S719 of FIG. 7A, and the remaining steps of FIG. 7C are<br>
equal to those of FIG. 7A, such that only the above-<br>
mentioned steps S754, S758, and S7 59. of FIG. 7C will be<br>
described. For the convenience of description, it should be<br>
noted that step S754 is called a fourth step, step S758 is<br>
called a fifth step, and step S759 is called a sixth step.<br>
.In .the case nf the fourth step S754, the first SET 700's<br>
location information is calculated by the SET-initiated<br>
positioning procedure. If the first SET 700rs location<br>
information is acquired, the H-SLP 710 transmits the RLP<br>
SRLREP (Roaming Location Protocol Standard Roaming Location<br>
Report) to the N-SLP 720 acting as the second SET'S HN, and<br>
requests the N-SLP 720 to transmit the first SET 700r s<br>
location information to the second SET 730.<br>
In the case of the fifth step S758, the second SET 730<br>
informs the N-SLP 720 of the processing result of the SUPL<br>
POS NOTIFICATION message via the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP<br>
message. In this case, if the ACK mode information<br>
indicates that there is a need for the second SET 730 to<br>
transmit an acknowledgement signal, indicating the reception<br>
of the first SET 700's location information, to the first<br>
SET 700, the second SET 730 receiving the first SET 700's<br>
location information includes the acknowledgement signal in<br>
the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP message, and transmits the<br>
SUPL POS NOTIFICATION RESP message including the<br><br>
65<br>
acknowledgement signal to the N-SLP 720.<br>
In the case of the sixth step S759, the N-SLP 720 transmits<br>
the RLP SRLRA (Roaming Location Protocol Standard Roaming<br>
Location Report Answer) message including the location-<br>
information transmission result to the H-SLP 710. In this<br>
case, if the N-SLP 720 receives the acknowledgement signal<br>
from the second. SET 730, it includes the acknowledgement<br>
signal into the RLP SRLRA message, and transmits the RLP<br>
SRLRA message including the acknowledgement signal to the H-<br>
SLP 710.<br>
FIGS. 8A~8C are conceptual diagrams illustrating a method<br>
for transmitting location information according to a 14-th<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Compared with the location information transmission method<br>
shown in FIGS. 7A~7C, only information contained in the<br>
SUPL START message at step S811, S831, or S851 (during which<br>
the first SET 70©- transmits the SUPL START message to the H-<br>
SLP 710) of FIGS. 8A~8C is different from that of FIGS.<br>
7A~7C. Therefore, only the above steps S811, 831, and S851<br>
of FIG. 8A~8C will be described for the convenience of<br>
description. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
a plurality of steps for the position information<br>
transmission method of FIGS. 7A~7C can also be applied to<br>
the preferred embodiment of FIGS. 8A-8C.<br>
The first SET 7 00 transmits the SUPL START message to the H-<br><br>
66<br>
SLP 710.to initiate the positioning procedure at step S811,<br>
S831, or S851. In this case, the first SET 700 requests the<br>
H-SLP 420 to transmit location information of the second SET<br>
730, or requests the H-SLP 710 to transmit the first SET<br>
700's location information to the second SET 730 at step<br>
S811, S831, or S851. For the above-mentioned request<br>
operations, the SUPL START message may include session-id<br>
information, lid information, qop information, SET<br>
capability information, SET ID information, and ACK mode<br>
information, etc.<br>
For example, if the SET initiating the positioning procedure<br>
is the first SET 700 and the target SET desired by the first<br>
SET 700 is the second SET 730, a SET ID may be the second<br>
SET 730's ID. In other words, the target SET ID may be the<br>
second SET 730's ID. If the SET initiating the positioning<br>
procedure is the first SET 700 and the third party is<br>
desired by the first SET 700 as a transmission destination<br>
of the first SET 700's location information, a SET ID may be<br>
the second SET 730's ID. In other words, the third Party ID<br>
may be the second SET 730's ID.<br>
A detailed description of messages will hereinafter be<br>
described with reference to FIGS. 9 - 17. The following<br>
messages can also be applied to other preferred embodiments<br>
other than the above-mentioned preferred embodiments shown<br>
in FIGS, 1A-8C.<br><br>
61<br>
FIG. 9 exemplarily shows a Common Part commonly contained in<br>
transmission/reception messages communicated between a<br>
terminal and a server in the case of a method for<br>
transmitting location information according to the present<br>
invention. For example, the Common Part may be considered<br>
to be a message header.<br>
The Common Part composed of octets may include a "Message<br>
Length" parameter for indicating a total length of a ULP<br>
(User Plane Location Protocol) message; a "Version"<br>
parameter for indicating ULP protocol version information in<br>
the form of a major-, minor-, or service indicator; a<br>
Session id" parameter for indicating a unique session ID of<br>
the message; and a "Message Payload" parameter including one<br>
of the messages prescribed in the ULP. In this case, the<br>
Session id" parameter may include ID information of a<br>
specific SET capable of performing the positioning procedure.<br>
Particularly, there are a variety of messages prescribed in<br>
the "Message Payload" parameter, for example, the SUPL INIT<br>
message, the SUPL START message, the SUPL RESPONSE message,<br>
the SUPL POS INIT message, the SUPL POS message, the SUPL<br>
END message, the SUPL AUTH REQ message, the SUPL AUTH RESP<br>
message, and the SUPL POS NOTIFICATION message, etc.<br>
FIG. 10 exemplarily shows an initialization message (SUPL<br>
INIT) according to the present invention. Particularly, FIG.<br>
10 shows the SUPL INIT message acting as the initialization<br><br>
68<br>
message transmitted from the SLP to the first SET.<br>
The SUPL INIT message includes a "Positioning Method"<br>
parameter, a "Notification" parameter, a "Session ID"<br>
parameter, a "QoP" parameter, an "SLP Mode" parameter, an<br>
"MAC" parameter, and a "Key Identity" parameter.<br>
The "Positioning Method" parameter indicates positioning<br>
technologies requested by the SLP. The "Notification"<br>
parameter performs LCS notification, and transmits privacy-<br>
associated information to the SET. The "Session ID"<br>
parameter includes an SLP address. The "QoP" parameter<br>
indicates a Desired Quality of Position. The "SLP Mode"<br>
parameter indicates whether the SLP mode is the Proxy Mode<br>
or the Non-Proxy Mode. The "MAC" parameter includes a<br>
Message Authentication Code (MAC) used for Integrity<br>
Protection of the SUPL INIT message. The "Key Identity"<br>
parameter indicates identity information associated with a<br>
key used for checking the, MAC'.<br>
The "Session ID" parameter includes an SPC address in the<br>
case of the Non-Proxy Mode. The "SLP Address" field serves<br>
as an optional field in the case of the Proxy Mode, but it<br>
serves as a requisite field (also called a required field).<br>
in the case of the Non-Proxy Mode. The SLP address is<br>
indicative of an address used by the SET to construct a<br>
secure IP when the SET is connected to the SLP or the SPC.<br>
FIG. 11A shows a first preferred embodiment of a start<br><br>
69<br>
message (SUPL START) according to the present invention.<br>
Particularly, FIG. HA exemplarily shows the SUPL START<br>
message acting as the start message transmitted from the<br>
first SET to the SLP.<br>
The SUPL START message may include a "SET capabilities'"<br>
parameter, a "Location Id" parameter, a "QoP" parameter, a<br>
"Notified SET Id" parameter, a "MO mode" parameter, and an<br>
"ACK mode" parameter, etc. In this case, the "MO mode"<br>
parameter may be defined as a terminal start-location<br>
request mode, and the "ACK mode" parameter may be defined as<br>
a location-information acknowledgement mode.<br>
