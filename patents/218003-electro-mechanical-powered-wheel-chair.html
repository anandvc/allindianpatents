				<td>4.    DESCRIPTION<br>
The object of this invention is to help daily living activities usefulness, self esteem and social activity of severely physically challenged persons and chronically all cases. Who find difficult to propel manual wheel chairs because of weak and paralyzed muscles or chromic arthritis deformed cases. The aim is to provide enhance easy transport to and from place of vocation and promote the activities inside and out side his provides.<br>
Large number of sophisticated electrical wheel chairs are available in United states, European Country but the prohibitive prices problem of repair makes it unreachable for average disabled persons. In this innovation of electro mechanical powered wheel chair all has been made to keep the mechanism as less expensive and easily available and reparable as possible. The disadvantages of using separate knobs for various movements of the electrically operated mobility systems available have been overcome in this invention.<br>
The invention of electro-mechanical powered wheelchair is a system of mobility for severely handicapped person who can negotiate on both even indoor rooms and verandahs as well as on rough roads and mild slopes. It is built on steel pipe frame manual wheel chair with sturdier larger wheels shifted to the front and the small castor replaced by wheels shifted to the rear electrical drive unit assembly is fitted to the front wheels. The angular movement of the rear wheels is powered by separate small motor and gear box connected to the rear wheel by levers.<br>
BACKGROUND QF THE INVENTION<br>
All the wheelchairs that are being manufactured in India at present are operated manually, with the user using his hands to push the hand rim on the wheels of the wheelchair, or some assistant of the user pushing the wheelchair from behind for transportation of the user.<br>
This has its disadvantages because many a times the user may be an old and / or infirm person who may not be able to put in the effort for propelling the wheelchair and also because a suitable help or assistant may not be available to the user for moving the wheelchair.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
in the present invention, there is a main drive motor, a gear box, a steering mechanism (which has its own separate motor and reduction gear), two 12 volt batteries, clutch system, and an electronic joystick control which are fitted on to an appropriately designed wheelchair for it to be operated by the user by simple<br>
movements of the joystick of the joystick control unit placed on one of the arm rests of the wheelchair. Thus the disadvantages of a manually operated wheelchair are eliminated in the present invention.<br>
