				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of Garcinia extract powder<br>
from G.pedunculata.<br>
As dietary supplement, HCA is an effective addition to any weight management program. Allison et al.(Nutr.Res,1988,8,209-212) has reviewed the use of HCA as one of the alternative treatments for weight loss. The derivatives of HCA have been incorporated into many pharmaceutical preparations in combination with other ingredients for the purpose of enhancing weight loss, cardioprotection, correcting the conditions of lipid abnormalities and endurance(Jena et al., 2002 ,J. Agric. Food Chemistry, 50,10-22).<br>
(-)-Hydroxcitic acid (HCA) has been encountered first in the nature as the principal acid in the highly acidic fruits of Garcinia cambogia. The fruit rinds of G.cambogia and G. indica contains 20-30 % HCA. It is thus the prime source of HCA (Lewis, Y.S. and Neelakantan, S. 1965, Phytochemistry, 4, 619-625). So far HCA has been found in the fruits of certain species of Garcinia, which includes G. cambogia, G. indica, G.atroviridis and G. cowa (Lewis, Y.S. 1969, Methods in enzymology, 13, 613-623 ; Jena et al., 2002, J. Agric. Food Chemistry, 50,10-22). The chemistry and biochemistry of HCA has been discussed recently (Jena et al., 2002, J. Agric. Food Chemistry, 50,10-22). During extensive animal studies, HCA has been proven to effectively curb appetite, suppress food intake, increase the rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis, reduce fatty acid synthesis and lipogenesis and decrease body-weight gain.<br>
Reference may be made to Majeed et al. (Majeed, M., Badmaev, V and Rajendran, R. US Patent. 5783603, 1998), wherein the preparation of potassium hydroxycitrate from Garcinia fruit was reported. The main drawback of this product is the potassium salt of hydroxycitrate is not stable and hygroscopic. Furthermore, the salt forms of (-) HCA reduces the solubility and hinders bioavailability and it has been observed that soluble extract of Garcinia was proven to be more effective than salt forms (Sawada, et al, 1997, Nihon yukagaka kaishi, vol 46:1467-1474).<br><br><br>
Reference may be made to the commercial samples Garcinia cambogia extracts, where the HCA is present as its calcium salt (Sawada, et at, 1997, Nihon yukagaka kaishi, vol 46:1467-1474). But the excess calcium reduces the solubility and subsequently bioavailability when it is compared to the liquid extract.<br>
Another reference may be made to the Ashok kumar., Ravindranath, B., and Balasubramamanvam (US patent  656314, 1996 ). This hydroxycitric acid concentrate prepared from the fruit rind of the Garcinia combogia.G.atroviridis and G.indica and the acid is in the liquid form .<br>
It may be noted that all these references are in HCA derivatives. But, so far there is no report of Garcinia extract powder in its native form.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to produce Garcinia extract powder from a new source, that is, from the newer species of Garcinia .pedunculata.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop a product of Garcinia extract powder is its native form with out any derivatives.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to develop a product of Garcinia extract powder in native form.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is the HCA powder has higher HCA content (60-65%) compared to the existing products.<br>
The plant Garcinia pedunculata used in the present invention is available in the North Eastern region of India, where it is used a souring agent in food preparations.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides process for the preparation of Garcinia extract powder from G. pedunculata, wherein the steps comprise:<br>
[a]	cutting rinds of G. pedunculata into small pieces;<br>
[b]	extracting the pieces as obtained in step [a] with water by autoclaving for a period of 20 to 50 minutes at a pressure ranging between 5 to 20 psi;<br>
[c]	filtering the extract as obtained in step [b] by known methods to get a filtrate;<br>
[d]	spray drying the filtrate as obtained in step [c] in a conventional spray drier at an inlet temperature of 130 to 160 degree c and outlet temperature in the range of 80 to 95 degree C, at a feed rate of 70 to 95 ml/min to obtain the desired Garcinia extract powder.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the Hydroxicity acid [HCA] content of<br>
Garcinia powder obtained is in the range of 60-65% on dry basis.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the autoclaving pressure used is<br>
preferably in the range of 15 to 20 psi.<br>
In still another embodiment, the Garcinia extract powder obtained has the following<br>
characteristics:<br>
Colour- light brown<br>
Moisture content - 15 to 20 %<br>
Free HCA - 20 to 25 %<br>
HCA lactone - 30 to 37%<br>
Solubility - highly soluble in water and methanol<br>
Storage stability - store under free humid conditions<br>
In the present invention, rinds of G. pedunculata, were cut into small pieces and extracted with water. The above extract was filtered through Whatman filter paper. The entire filtrate was fed to the spray dryer with the particular feed rate. Spray dryer was maintained at desired inlet and outlet temperatures. Powder was collected from the bottom of the dryer in an aluminium pack and immediately sealed.<br><br>
The purity of the preparation was analyzed by HPLC as follows. 0.1 g of hydroxycitric acid powder was dissolved in water and made up to 100ml with water, filtered and stored at 4°C until further use. The HCA content was determined by HPLC method. The high performance liquid chromatographic system consisted of a Hewlett Packard HPLC model HP 1100 Series (Hewlett-Packard, CA, USA), fitted with a Waters |a-Bondapack™ (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm I.D). The injection system (Rheodyne) used was 20 ul sample loop. Detection was done by a HP 1100 Series Variable Wavelength Detector at wavelength of 210 nm. The elution was carried out with 8 mM Sulfuric acid and flow rate was 1.0 ml/min under isocratic condition. A known volume of (10-20 pi) of the samples prepared as above was injected on to the HPLC and the concentration of HCA was obtained directly from the peak area and by application of the dilution factor. The HCA concentration of the sample was expressed as g/100 g of sample (Jayaprakasha, G.K. and Sakariah, K.K. J. Liquid Chromatography &amp; Related Technologies, 23, 915-923, 2000). The purity of hydroxycitric acid and HCA lactone were found to be 20-25% and 30-37% (w/w).<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the preparation of Garcinia extract powder containing Hydroxicitic acid (HCA) in its native form from a new source i.e. new species of G. pedunculate.<br>
Product specification<br>
(a). Colour    - Light brown<br>
(b). Moisture content -15-20 %<br>
(c). Free HCA - 20-25 %<br>
(d). HCA lactone - 30-37 %<br>
(e). Solubility - Highly soluble in water and methanol<br>
(f). Storage Stability - Store under humid free condition<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

The entire filtrate was fed through the spray dryer with the feed rate of 70ml/min. The inlet and outlet temperature of spray dryer was maintained at 135°C and 95°C respectively. Powder was collected from the bottom of the dryer in an aluminum pack and immediately sealed. The HCA content was determined by HPLC method. The purity of hydroxycitric acid and HCA lactone were found to be 22% and 33% (w/w).<br>
