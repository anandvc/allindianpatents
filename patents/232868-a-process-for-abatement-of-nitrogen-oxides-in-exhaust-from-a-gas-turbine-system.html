CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial Number 08/597,209 filed, February 6, 1996, a continuation of application Serial Number 08/356,492 filed December 15, 1994, now U.S. Patent number 5,498,370, which applications are specifically incorporated herein, each in its entirety, by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to processes for reduction of nitrogen oxides in exhaust from gas turbines using conventional carbonaceous fuels. In particular, the invention relates to utilization of products from hydroshifting of dimethyl ether, i.e. dihydrogen (molecular hydrogen) and carbon oxideis (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) formed by a process for catalytically reacting dimethyl ether in the presence of steam.<br>
More specifically, this invention is a process for abatement of nitrogen oxides in exhaust from a gas turbine system having a compressor section which receives and compresses a gaseous source of dioxygen which is directed to a combustor section from which a combustion product stream is directed to a turbine section. The process comprises: mixing a stream of gaseous fuel and a supplementary gaseous stream comprising dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, with a source of dioxygen to form a combustible gaseous mixture; combusting the mixture to produce heat and a combustion product stream; and driving a turbine with the combustion product stream to produce an exhaust stream and to generate mechanical power.<br>
During combustion of carbonaceous fuels in gas turbine systems, dioxygen (molecular oxygen) from the air combines, unfortunately, with nitrogen from the air to form nitrogen<br>
oxides. Such reactions occur to a greater extent at higher temperatures of operation. Additionally, some oils that are fired in gas turbine systems have fixed nitrogen, a part of which reacts, generally, with dioxygen from the air to also form nitrogen oxides. This reaction occurs even at relatively low temperatures of combustion.<br>
Nitrogen oxides formed during combustion of many carbonaceous flues are, therefore, present in exhaust gases form gas turbine systems which is, generally regarded as undesirable. There are numerous government regulations which limit amounts of nitrogen oxides which may be emitted into the atmosphere by gas turbine exhaust. Furthermore, rapid cooling of combustion products from a gas turbine system causes much of the nitric oxide (NO) to be oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (N02). Consequently, there is a need for apparatus and processes which reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions from gas turbines.<br>
A gas turbine systems are, typically, designed to burn oil, natural gas or other fuels. Fuel is mixed with air in a combustor can. As air and fuel enter the combustion area, combustion occurs in a flame zone where temperatures are, normally, well above 1650° C. Combustion products are cooled to around 1100° C by mixing with additional air which enters through a register. Combustion products, diluted with additional air, exit the combustor can and go through duct work to an expansion turbine where they drive turbine blades. These blades turn a shaft which in turn drives a compressor and a generator. After the power turbine extracts as much energy as possible from the combustion products, they are exhausted to the atmosphere through a stack.<br>
During combustion of fuel with dioxygen from air at very high temperatures, some of oxygen and nitrogen from air combine to form nitrogen oxide. In addition, a large fraction of fixed nitrogen, which is present in petroleum, coal, and some other fuels, combines with dioxygen from the air to form nitrogen oxide.<br><br>
Numerous attempts have been made to develop devices and processes which reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions from these gas turbine systems." One such approach involves injection of water into the flame zone in order to reduce the peak temperatures of the flame and thus reduce the formation of nitrogen oxide. This process has had some technical and commercial success, but it suffers from at least three disadvantages. First, the water injection reduces efficiency of the process, making it necessary to burn more fuel to obtain the same amount of electrical power. Second, the water contains suspended and dissolved solids, such that even with relatively clean water, paniculate emissions are increased. These particulate emissions may also be considered undesirable. Third, the water injection may increase the carbon monoxide emissions.<br>
Other proposed modifications include changes to the combustor can in order to reduce NOx emissions. These changes are intended to add air to the combustor can in greater than stoichiometric quantities, so that combustion occurs at a lower temperature. In diffusion flames, combustion occurs at stoichiometric mixtures. Flame temperatures are, therefore, maximized even though the quantity of air surrounding the combustion is large enough to dilute the flame, causing it to bum at a lower temperature. Excess air mixes with the combustion products at a very high temperature and a portion of the oxygen contained therein reacts to form NO.<br>
In gas turbine systems, combustion air or working fluid is compressed to very high pressures which causes the temperature to become very high. Fuel is introduced simultaneously with the hot, compressed air into the combustor can. Fuel burns in the air, raising the temperature and volume further. Combustion products are then introduced into the power turbine where they can expand. Generally, a great excess of air flowing around the combustor can is used to limit the peak temperature. Holes in the can allow some air to enter around the periphery of the can to provide further cooling. This air is sometimes induced to flow as a film on the inside perimeter of<br><br>
the can. Other air flows along the outside of the can. Both air flows cool the can and in turn become heated. This air then<br>
•<br>
enters the burner as very high temperature combustion air. Various improvements with alternative holes cut in the can have been tried, but have met with only limited success.<br>
Burner modifications have also met with limited success. Since each can has only one burner, it is not possible to run the burners in a non-stoichiometric mode. Although each gas turbine may have several combustor cans, each can must have an excess of air to cool it properly. It is thus not possible to operate some cans in a fuel rich mode and others in an air rich mode, and then mix the products to complete the combustion and produce the desired temperature for the turbine.<br>
Some of these approaches have been successfully utilized on boilers, but are not practical in gas turbines. Other techniques for reducing NOx emissions, such as reduced air preheat, increased primary furnace size, flue gas recirculation, improved heat transfer, in-furnace NOx reduction, and thermal DeNOx processes, which have been found to be effective in furnaces are also not practical in gas turbines.<br>
There is, therefore, a need for a method and apparatus to reduce NOx emissions from gas turbines.<br>
Conversion of low molecular weight alkanes, such as methane, to synthetic fuels or chemicals has received increasing attention as low molecular weight alkanes are generally available from secure and reliable sources. For example, natural gas wells and oil wells currently produce vast quantities of methane. In addition, low molecular weight alkanes are generally present in coal deposits and may be formed during mining operations, in petroleum processes, and in the gasification or liquefaction of coal, tar sands, oil shale, and biomass.<br>
Many of these alkane sources are located in relatively remote areas, far from potential users. Accessibility is a major obstacle to effective and extensive use of remotely situated<br><br><br>
methane, ethane and natural gas. Costs associated with liquefying natural gas by compression or, alternatively, constructing and maintaining pipelines to transport natural gas to users are often prohibitive. Consequently, methods for converting low molecular weight alkanes to more easily transportable liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks are desired and a number of such methods have been reported.<br>
Reported methods can be conveniently categorized as direct oxidation routes and/or as indirect syngas routes. Direct oxidative routes convert lower alkanes to products such as methanol, gasoline, and relatively higher molecular weight alkanes. In contrast, indirect syngas routes involve, typically, production of synthesis gas as an intermediate<br>
Routes are known for converting methane to dimethyl ether. For example, methane is steam reformed to produce synthesis gas. Thereafter, dimethyl ether and methanol can be manufactured simultaneously from the synthesis gas, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,341,069 issued to Bell et al. The '069 Patent recommends a dimethyl ether synthesis catalyst having copper, zinc, and chromium co-precipitated on a gamma-alumina base. Interestingly, the '069 Patent states that dimethyl ether product can be charged as power generator fuel to a combustor of a gas turbine-prime mover arrangement, either alone or simultaneously with synthesis gas.<br>
Alternatively, methane is converted to methanol and dimethyl ether is subsequently manufactured from methanol by passing a mixed vapor containing methanol and water over an alumina catalyst, as described in an article by Hutchings in New Scientist (3 July 1986) 35.<br>
Having a relatively low vapor pressure, dimethyl ether is readily transportable. Moreover, dimethyl ether can be economically produced in relatively small quantities, as compared to materials such as compressed natural gas which require economies of scale associated with large cryogenic plants to be produced competitively. On the other hand, synthesis gas<br><br>
reportedly produces very little atmospheric pollution when combusted with air as fuel. Therefore, a practical process for converting dimethyl ether to synthesis gas on a commercial, scale would be attractive to, among others, natural gas producers situated far from fuel consumers.<br>
Known processes for producing synthesis gas typically react hydrocarbons with steam at elevated temperature over a catalyst. Generally, more complex hydrocarbons are converted to methane which is then steam reformed to produce hydrogen or synthesis gas.<br>
United Kingdom Patent Application GB 2213496 A listing Lywood as inventor describes the production of hydrogen-containing gas streams by an endothermic catalyzed reforming between methane and steam. The '496 Application proposes the following equations for the steam reforming of methane(Equation Removed)<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,592,903 issued to Osman et al., states that carbon monoxide can be exothermically converted to carbon dioxide and hydrogen through a reaction termed a water-gas shift, represented by the equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)Reportedly, the "shift" reaction, can be accomplished in two shift conversion vessels operating at different temperatures to maximize yield. The '903 patent states that a temperature of from about 600° to 900° F and a pressure of about 300 psig to 1,000 psig is effective in a high-temperature shift converter containing a supported, chromium-promoted iron catalyst. The '903 Patent further states that a low-temperature shift conversion takes place over a catalyst comprising a mixture of<br>
500° F and a pressure of from  about  300 psig to  about   1,000 psig.<br>
It is important to distinguish between the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, as described above, and the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. Partial oxidation of methane produces two moles of dihydrogen (diatomic hydrogen) for each mole of methane reacted. In contrast, steam reforming of methane produces three moles of dihydrogen per mole of reacted methane.<br>
Partial oxidation of methane is described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,618,451 issued to Gent. The '451 Patent states that methane is reacted with oxygen from an air separation plant, the proportion of oxygen being less than sufficient for complete combustion. A hot gas containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide is said to be produced. The '451 patent also states that steam or nitrogen can be present during the combustion to act as a temperature modifier and to avoid soot formation. Additional hydrocarbon is, reportedly, injected into the hot gas, and the resulting gas mixture is reacted over a steam reforming catalyst.<br>
A particular class of partial oxidation processes for converting methane or natural gas to synthesis gas are known as autothermal processes. By convention, the autothermal process includes an exothermic oxidation step and an endothennic steam reforming step which are in approximate heat balance. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,112,257 issued to Kobylinski and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, describes an autothermal process for converting natural gas to synthesis gas which includes the steps of mixing natural gas with air, subjecting a resulting mixture to simultaneous partial oxidation and steam reforming reactions, and subsequently reacting unconverted alkanes with water in the presence of a catalyst having steam reforming activity.<br>
Processes which produce hydrogen or hydrogen-containing mixtures by reacting a single-carbon saturated alcohol, methanol, with steam are collectively termed methanol steam reforming processes. U.S. Patent No. 4,091,086 issued to Hindin et al.<br>
describes a process for producing hydrogen by reacting steam with methanol in the presence of a catalytic composition at elevated temperatures. The '086 Patent reports states that methanol can be converted to hydrogen in a single-stage reaction over a catalytic composition comprising zinc oxide, copper oxide, thorium oxide, and aluminum oxide. Moreover, the '086 Patent states, without citing authority or presenting evidence in support, that ' the composition catalyzes a purported methanol decomposition. The purported decomposition is described as producing significant amounts of carbon monoxide which are immediately consumed in a water gas shift reaction.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,743,576 issued to Schneider et al. describes a catalyst for the production of synthesis gas or hydrogen from aqueous methanol by dissociation or steam reforming. The catalyst reportedly contains a noble metal component on an oxide carrier which comprises an oxide of cerium or titanium and, also, an oxide of zirconium or lanthanum.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,865,624 issued to Okada describes a process for reacting methanol with steam including a decomposition reaction zone regulated at a temperature between 250° C and 300° C and a conversion reaction zone regulated between 150° C and 200° C. The '624 patent postulates an alleged methanol decomposition for producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide directly from methanol. The conversion reaction zone described in the '624 patent is, apparently, intended to promote the well-known water gas shift reaction.<br>
An integrated turbo-electric power generation system which incorporates methanol reforming as a source of fuel and as a means of heat recovery is described in sales literature circulated by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization under the authority of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan cerca 1985. The sales literature states that methanol and steam are passed through catalysts at temperatures in the range of 250° C to 350° C to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide in an endothermic<br>
produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide in an endothermic reaction. The hydrogen-containing gas is reportedly combusted with air to drive a turbine. The sales literature indicates that the reforming reactor charge and the combustion air stream can be heat exchanged with the turbine exhaust to promote energy efficiency.<br>
Despite some earlier speculation regarding the existence of a direct methanol decomposition mechanism, practitioners generally agree that methanol steam reforming proceeds by a mechanism which does not involve the direct decomposition of methanol to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Rather, it is accepted that the steam reforming of methanol creates methyl format and formic acid as intermediaries. For example, an article by Jiang et al., Applied Catalysis A: General, 97 (1993) 145-158 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, cites studies and presents experimental data indicating that steam reforming of methanol proceeds via dehydrogenation to methyl formate, hydrolysis of methyl formate to formic acid, and decomposition of formic acid to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. According to the Jiang et al. article, no carbon monoxide production was detected while passing methanol over a copper, zinc oxide and alumina catalyst at temperatures below 250° C. The Jiang et al. article reports that significant amounts of carbon monoxide were formed only at temperatures over 300° C. Moreover, the Jiang et al. article states that methanol steam reforming proceeds in accord with the following equations:<br>
(Equation Removed)UK Patent Application GB 2085314 A listing Twigg as inventor describes a catalytic process for reacting a hydrocarbon with steam in net endothermic conditions to produce a gas containing carbon oxides and hydrogen. The process is, reportedly, carried out using a catalyst comprising the product of<br><br>
thermally decomposing and reducing intimately associated compounds of nickel and/or cobalt and at least one difficulty reducible metal. Reportedly, the catalyst also comprises a water* insoluble compound of an alkali metal oxide with an acidic or amphoteric oxide or mixed oxide.<br>
The '314 Application states that the alkali metal, usually sodium or potassium, is chosen on the basis of the vapor pressure of its hydroxide form, so as to be available as an alkaline metal hydroxide to catalyze a reaction between carbon deposited on the catalyst and steam. The '314 Application speculates that the starting hydrocarbon can be any of those proposed for use with a catalytic steam/hydrocarbon reaction including methane, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, methanol, dimethyl ether, and isobutyraldehyde. However, as explained below the presence of potassium hydroxide actually hinders the reaction of dimethyl ether and steam.<br>
In order to better utilize remotely situated sources of natural gas, to transport the energy inherent in natural gas in a safer and more economic manner, and to provide a fuel which creates very little atmospheric pollution when combusted in air, a commercially practical method for transforming dimethyl ether and steam to synthesis gas is desired. Preferably, the improved method is suitable for integration into modem power generation schemes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for abatement of nitrogen oxides in exhaust from a gas turbine system having a compressor section which receives and compresses a gaseous source of dioxygen which is directed to a combustor section from which a combustion product stream is directed to a turbine section, which process comprises:<br>
introducing, into the combustor, a supplementary gaseous stream comprising dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide, and a stream of gaseous fuel, with a source of dioxygen to form a combustible gaseous mixture;<br>
combusting the mixture to produce heat and a combustion product stream; and<br>
driving a turbine with the combustion product stream to produce an exhaust stream and to generate mechanical power.<br>
The invention provide economical processes for abatement of nitrogen oxides in exhaust from a gas turbine system having a compressor section which receives and compress a gaseous source of dioxygen which is directed to a combustor section from which a combustion product stream is directed to a turbine section.<br>
To reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides in exhaust from gas turbine systems in accordance with the invention, we introduce, into a combustor, a supplementary gaseous stream comprising<br>
dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a stream of gaseous fuel and/or mixtures thereof, with a source of dioxygen to form a combustible gaseous mixture; combust the mixture to produce heat and a combustion product stream; and drive a turbine with the combustion product stream to produce an exhaust stream and to generate mechanical power.<br>
Supplementary gaseous streams are, preferably, formed by a process for hydroshifting dimethyl ether, i.e. formed by a process which comprises passing a feed stream which includes dimethyl ether and steam to a hydroshifting reaction zone including an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of copper or nickel in elemental form. This process produces a hydroshifted product stream which is, advantageously, relatively rich in dibydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.<br>
Feed streams which include dimethyl ether can be transported relatively easily in liquid form at comparatively low pressures. The hydroshifting reaction zone can include a hydrolysis reaction zone and a water gas shift reaction zone. Hydrolyzed product and water-gas shift product can be recovered to obtain di hydrogen and carbon dioxide, respectively. Additionally, hydroshifted product can be blended directly with conventional fuels and/or an oxidizing stream and combusted to drive a turbine in order to generate mechanical energy.<br>
The simplicity of the process makes it useful for both new gas turbines and retrofitting of existing gas turbines. The system relies on a combination of conventional fuel and supplementary gaseous stream comprising dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide for NOx control, so that there is no need for the fuel consuming step of water injection. The low temperature at which this process takes place further serves to reduce the equilibrium level of nitrogen oxide in the flue gas, and hence increases the nitrogen oxide reduction possible. Moreover, expensive water treatment and high pressure water pumps are not required.<br>
These and other advantages and features of the present invention will be more fully understood with reference to the presently preferred embodiments thereof and to the appended drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference should now be made to the embodiments illustrated in greater detail in the accompanying drawings and described below by way of examples of the invention.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a schematic flow diagram depicting a preferred aspect of the present invention for generating mechanical and thermal energy in which a supplementary gaseous mixture comprising synthesis gas, produced by hydroshifting dimethyl ether with steam, and conventional gas-turbine fuel are combusted with a source of dioxygen to provide abatement of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gas.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br>
Any gaseous or vaporizable stream which provides a source of gases comprising 'dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, can be used as the supplementary gaseous stream in accordance with this invention.<br>
Suitable supplementary streams contain amounts of dihydrogen and carbon oxides (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) such that their ratios of dihydrogen to carbon oxides are, typically, in a range upward from about 1.5, preferably in a range from about 1.6 to 20. More preferred supplementary streams have ratios of dihydrogen to carbon oxides in a range from about 2 to 10, and most preferred in a range from about 2.5 to 5.<br><br>
The supplementary gaseous stream is, preferably, formed by a process for hydroshifting dimethyl ether which is the subject of our U.S. Patent number 5,498,370. The process for hydroshifting dimethyl ether includes, generally, passing a feed stream of dimethyl ether and steam to a hydroshifting reaction zone including an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of copper or nickel in elemental form. The process produces a hydroshifted product stream which is relatively rich in dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.<br>
Hydroshifting is a method for hydrolyzing dimethyl ether with steam to produce a mixture containing carbon oxides and dihydrogen. The method employs a metal in substantially elemental form which catalyzes the hydrolysis. A water-gas shift reaction converts carbon monoxide, which is usually present in the hydrolysis product, to relatively more inert carbon dioxide. The hydrolysis and shift reactions take place in a single reaction zone or, alternatively, in separate reaction zones where reaction conditions can be individually optimized. When separate reaction zones are provided, heat is efficiently transferred from the water-gas shift reaction zone to the hydrolysis reaction zone. The hydroshifted product stream can be utilized as fuel to power a turbine, and an integrated heat transfer scheme can be used to recover heat from the turbine exhaust stream.<br>
In one aspect, hydroshifting dimethyl ether is a process which comprises passing a feed stream which includes about one to about six molar parts steam and one molar part dimethyl ether to a hydroshifting reaction zone including an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of copper or nickel in elemental form.   The feed stream enters the hydroshifting reactor zone at a temperature, of about 150° C to about 800° C.   A product stream is produced which is relatively rich in dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide as compared to the feed stream.<br>
In another aspect hydroshifting dimethyl ether is a process which comprises passing a feed stream which includes about one to about six molar parts" steam and one molar part dimethyl ether at a temperature of about 300° C to about 800° C to a hydrolysis reaction zone including an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of a non-noble metal in elemental form. A hydrolyzed stream, which is relatively rich in dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, is produced in the hydrolysis reaction zone and passed at a temperature of about 150° C to less than about 300° C to a water-gas shift reaction zone including a water-gas shift reaction catalyst. In the shift reaction zone, a product stream is produced which is relatively rich in dihydrogen and carbon dioxide as compared to the hydrolyzed stream.<br>
The hydroshifting process, in another aspect, comprises vaporizing a predominantly liquid mixture to produce a predominantly gaseous feed stream including one molar part dimethyl ether and about one to about six molar parts steam.<br>
t<br>
The feed stream is passed at a temperature of about 150° C to about a temperature of 800° C to a hydroshifting reaction zone including an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of a metal in elemental form. A hydroshifted stream is produced and mixed with an oxidizing stream. The resulting mixture is combusted to produce heat and a combustion product stream which drives a turbine for generating mechanical power. The turbine also produces an exhaust stream, which can be utilized to vaporize the liquid mixture which gives rise to the gaseous feed stream.<br>
Preferred Aspects of hydroshifting dimethyl ether<br>
In a preferred aspect, hydroshifting dimethyl ether is a process which comprises passing a feedstream that includes a substantial proportion of dimethyl ether to a hydroshifting reaction zone. The feedstream may additionally include methanol, and is preferably the product stream of a process which simultaneously produces dimethyl ether and methanol.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,341,069, issued to Bell et al., is hereby incorporated in its entirety, and especially for its teachings regarding dimethyl ether production. The feedstream also includes about one to about six molar parts steam, preferably about two to about four molar parts steam, and most preferably about three molar parts steam based on the amount of dimethyl ether present.<br>
Hydroshifting is defined for the present purposes as a reaction between dimethyl ether and steam, which ultimately produces dihydrogen and carbon dioxide. It is believed, although not critical to the success of the invention, that the hydroshifting reaction proceeds by way of at least two component reactions. In the first component reaction, dimethyl ether is hydrolyzed with steam to produce dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In the second component reaction, carbon monoxide interacts with steam to produce additional dihydrogen and additional carbon dioxide.<br>
Three molar parts of steam are stoichiometrically required to complete the hydroshifting reaction of one molar part of dimethyl ether to dihydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydroshifting reaction can proceed to some extent with less than the stoichiometrically required amount of steam, but carbon monoxide is present in the product stream produced under such reactant-limited conditions. When less than about one molar part of steam is in the feedstream, relatively little of the dimethyl ether is reacted. Conversely, when more than the stoichiometrically required amount of steam is present, dimethyl ether conversion and selectivity for carbon dioxide tend to increase, and the rate of formation of an undesirable carbon-rich by-product known as coke tends to decrease.<br>
Preferably, both of the component reactions take place in a hydroshifting reaction zone. To this end, the feedstream is passed to the hydroshifting reaction zone at a temperature of about 150° C to about 800° C, more preferably about 300° C to about 600° C and most preferably about 350° C to about 500° C<br><br>
The  entire  hydroshifting  reaction   zone   need  not   operate   at   a single   temperature,    and    it    is    contemplated    that    reaction<br>
•<br>
temperature   profiles   are   adjusted   within   the    above-stated ranges to optimize the composition of the product stream.<br>
Within the hydroshifting reaction zone is an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of elemental copper, elemental nickel or a mixture thereof. For the present purposes, the alkali metals are defined as lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium and francium. Essentially metal-free in this context means that the alkali metals are not present at all or are present in such minute quantities as to have no more than a negligible effect on catalytic performance. For the present purposes, a metal is in elemental form when the metal has an oxidation number of zero.<br>
Presence of a significant quantity of any of the alkali metals appears to cause a measurable deactivation of catalytic activity for the hydroshifting of dimethyl ether. Conversely, it is hypothesized that a neutral or slightly acidic environment enhances the hydroshifting reaction. Preferably, the catalytic composition includes alumina, more preferably alumina in a form which is slightly acidic.<br>
It is preferred that the hydroshifting reaction zone additionally contains a water gas shift reaction catalyst. Suitable water gas shift catalysts have been developed for reacting carbon monoxide in synthesis gas to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide, as described in Catalyst Handbook 2nd Edition, Chapter 6, edited by M. B. Twigg and published by Wolf Publishing, Limited, 1989.<br>
Preferably, the water gas shift catalyst of the present invention is substantially composed of iron oxide, chromium oxide, copper oxide, zinc oxide or a mixture thereof. More preferably the catalyst is substantially composed of copper oxide and zinc oxide. Most preferably, copper oxide and zinc oxide are present in a ratio of about 1:1.<br><br>
The water gas shift reaction catalyst may be distributed homogeneously throughout the hydroshifting reaction zone or, preferably, concentrated in localized regions of the hydroshifting reaction zone. For example, the water gas shift reaction catalyst may be concentrated in regions having relatively lower temperatures.<br>
In another aspect, hydroshifting dimethyl ether is a process which comprises passing a feedstream, as described above, to a hydrolysis reaction zone in which a hydrolysis reaction takes places between dimethyl ether and steam. The hydrolysis reaction zone produces a hydrolyzed stream which is relatively rich in dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as compared to the feedstream. The hydrolysis reaction may be viewed as a component reaction of the hydroshifting of dimethyl ether.<br>
The hydrolysis reaction zone includes an essentially alkali metal-free catalytic composition substantially composed of a non-noble metal in elemental form. Preferably, the non-noble metal is vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper or mixtures thereof. Of these, nickel and copper are especially preferred as the non-noble metal.<br>
The non-noble metal is preferably dispersed on a substrate material. For example, the non-noble metal can be impregnated on alumina. It is recommended that the substrate be neutral or slightly acidic.<br>
A feed stream is passed to the hydroshifting reaction zone at a temperature of about 300° C to less than about 800° C, preferably about 150° C to about 500° C, and more preferably about 375° C to about 450° C. As the hydrolysis reaction is endothermic, the hydrolysis reaction zone typically exhibits a temperature profile having progressively cooler temperatures in the direction of flow. However, heat may be transferred from an external source to minimize, or even overcome, the endothermic effect if desired.<br><br>
The hydrolyzed stream exits the hydrolysis reaction zone and enters a water gas shift reaction zone at a temperature of about 150° C to less than about 300° C, more preferably less than about 250° C, and more preferably less than about 200° C. It is necessary to cool the hydrolyzed stream by, for example, heat exchange with another process stream so that the hydrolyzed stream enters the water gas shift reaction zone in the above-specified temperature range. The water gas shift reaction zone includes a water gas shift reaction catalyst, as described above, which catalyzes a water gas shift reaction to produce dihydrogen and carbon dioxide from carbon monoxide and water.<br>
Steam enters the hydrolysis zone and, preferably, additional steam enters the water gas shifting zone so that a total of about two to about four molar parts steam is passed to the reaction zones for each molar part of dimethyl ether which is passed to the hydrolysis reaction zone. More preferably, about two to about. three molar parts of steam enters the hydrolysis reaction zone and about one to about two additional molar parts steam enters the water gas shift reaction zone.<br>
It is important that the catalytic composition in the hydrolysis reaction zone includes a significant amount of the non-noble metal in elemental form. However, it is often convenient to ship the catalytic composition in an oxidized form from point of manufacture to point of use. Also, a portion of the non-noble metal may be inadvertently oxidized by, for example, accidental contact with air. Accordingly, it is recommended that the non-noble metal of catalytic composition be treated by passing a reducing stream over the catalytic composition, preferably after the catalytic composition has been loaded into the hydrolysis reaction zone.<br>
Preferably, the reducing stream includes a reducing agent that is selected from the group consisting of dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and mixtures thereof. Contact with hydrogen or<br><br>
carbon monoxide at moderate temperatures can reduce the non-noble metal relatively quickly and efficiently.<br>
•<br>
Alternatively, the reducing stream includes a precursor blend of steam with methane, ethane, propane, methanol, ethanol or mixtures thereof which decomposes in the reaction zone to produce an active agent capable of reducing a significant portion of the non-noble metal to elemental form. The reduction by precursor blend and decomposition generally requires more time as compared to the reduction by hydrogen or carbon monoxide, and may also require a comparatively elevated reducing temperature in order to reduce a significant portion of the non-noble metal. Reducing temperatures of about 100° C to about 1000° C are preferred, more preferably about 200° C to about 600° C, and most preferably at 300° C to 500° C.<br>
Under appropriate conditions of pressure, temperature and time, steam with dimethyl ether is a suitable precursor blend. However, the steam with dimethyl ether blend requires relatively higher reducing temperatures, comparatively higher temperatures and generally longer reduction periods. For example, an equal molar parts blend of steam with dimethyl ether requires about two hours to reduce a significant portion of the non-noble metal at 350° C at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Preferably, the hydroshifting zone includes a hydrolysis zone in which steam reacts endothermically with dimethyl ether and also includes a water-gas shift zone in which steam reacts exothermically with carbon monoxide. The hydrolysis zone contains the catalytic composition and the water-gas shift zone contains a water-gas shift catalyst. Preferably, the feed stream is charged to the hydrolysis zone at a temperature of about 300° C to about 800° C to produce a hydrolyzed stream which is rich in hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide as compared to the feed stream. It is especially preferred that the hydrolyzed stream is passed to the water-gas shift zone at a temperature in the range of about 150° C to less then about 300° C to produce the hydroshifted stream.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In order to better communicate the invention, still another preferred aspect of the invention for generating mechanical and thermal energy in which a supplementary gaseous mixture comprising synthesis gas, produced by hydroshifting dimethyl ether with steam, and conventional gas-turbine fuel are combusted with a source of dioxygen to provide aMffimenT of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gas is depicted schematically in FIGURE 1. The integrated process is subdivided by a broken line into hydroshifting subsection A and generating subsection B.<br>
Referring now to subsection A of FIGURE 1, a mixture<br>
containing dimethyl ether in substantially liquid form is<br>
unloaded from a road tanker 10 into dimethyl ether storage<br>
vessel 12. Charge pump 14 transfers the dimethyl ether liquid<br>
from storage vessel 12 through conduit 16 to heat exchanger 18<br>
where dimethyl ether liquid is substantially vaporized.<br>
Vaporized dimethyl ether exits heat exchanger 18 through<br>
conduit 20.	'<br>
Transfer pump 24 transfers liquid water from water storage vessel 22 through conduit 26 into heat exchanger 28 where the liquid water stream is essentially vaporized to produce a stream of steam. Steam so produced passes through conduits 29 and 32 and junctions 30 and 34 to join and blend with the stream of vaporized dimethyl ether from heat exchanger 18. The blended streams passes through conduit 36 into hydrolysis reactor 38 which contains hydrolysis catalyst 40. A hydrolyzed stream, rich in dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, flows from hydrolysis reactor 38 through conduits 42 and 45 and junctions 44 and 52.<br>
It should be apparent that the hydrolyzed stream is a valuable product in itself. A portion of the hydrolyzed stream can, optionally, be diverted form junction 44 through conduit 46 for delivery to a destination 48. The hydrolyzed stream may, subsequently, be separated to recover, for example, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and/or dihydrogen. Alternatively, the<br><br>
hydrolyzed stream can be utilized as a source of feed stock for chemical manufacturing.<br>
Optionally, a portion of the steam generated in heat exchanger 28 may be diverted from junction 30 through conduit 50 to be blended with the hydrolyzed stream at junction 52. Thereafter, the hydrolyzed stream flows through conduit 53 which includes, preferably, cooler 54 having an influent cooling stream 55 and an effluent cooling stream 56. The hydrolyzed stream passes from cooler 54 through conduit 57 to water-gas shift reactor 58 which contains a water-gas shift catalyst 59, as described above.<br>
In water-gas shift reactor 58, carbon monoxide and water interact to produce carbon dioxide and dihydrogen. A shift product stream flows out of reactor 58 through conduit 60 to junction 62. Optionally, a portion of the shift product stream can be taken from the junction 62 through a conduit 64 to destination 66. The shift product stream is relatively rich in carbon dioxide which can be recovered, for example, for use as an ingredient in carbonated beverages for human consumption, or as a feedstock for manufacturing various chemicals<br>
Referring now to subsection B of FIGURE 1, at least a portion of the shift product stream is used as the supplementary gaseous mixture which flows through conduit 68 to turbine combustor 70. Conventional gas-turbine fuel, for example, natural gas, is supplied to turbine combustor 70 from fuel storage 82 through conduit 94. An oxidizing stream containing a source of dioxygen is taken from source 84, for example, an atmospheric intake and heated through heat exchanger 82. A heated oxidizing stream passes from heater 82 via conduit 86, is compressed in compressor 88, and flows into turbine combustor 70 through conduit 90. Preferably, compressor 88 raises the pressure of the oxidizing stream to five atmospheres or more, more preferably to about 12 atmospheres or more, and most preferably to about 20 atmospheres or more as measured on the absolute pressure scale. In combustor 70 the water-gas shift<br><br>
product stream meets the oxidizing stream, and a combustion reaction takes place which liberates heat. Optionally, a combustion promoter catalyst is present in combustor 70 to enhance the combustion reactions. Combustion product flows from combustor 70 into turbine 74 through conduit 72.<br>
Turbine 74 is adapted to remove mechanical energy from the combustion product stream and to produce an exhaust stream which exits turbine 74 through conduit 80. The mechanical energy can be used, for example, to turn shaft 76 which powers electrical generator 78. Preferably, a portion of the mechanical energy produced by the turbine is used to turn shaft 92 which drives compressor 88.<br>
The exhaust stream, although normally at a lower temperature and/or pressure than the combustion product stream, contains useful thermal energy which can be recovered by heat exchange. At least a portion of the exhaust stream passes, preferably, into heat exchanger 28 via conduit 80 and heat exchanger 18 via conduit 96, whereby the exhaust stream serves as a heat source for vaporizing the aqueous stream and/or the dimethyl ether stream, respectively. Finally, the exhaust stream exits the heat exchanger 18 through a conduit 98 leading to a disposal destination 100. The destination 100 may be, for example, an elevated vent to atmosphere.<br>
Suitable gaseous fuel streams for use according to this invention include conventional carbonaceous fuels such as oil, natural gas or other fuel which is vaporizable. Natural gas or other fuel having little or no fixed nitrogen content comprise preferred gaseous fuel streams. The stream of gaseous fuel and the supplementary gaseous stream are mixed at ratios in a range of from about 1:19 to about 19:1 by volume measured under conditions of 25° C temperature and 1 atmosphere pressure<br>
The gaseous fuel stream and the hydroshifted stream are, typically, mixed with an oxidizer stream which, preferably, includes air as an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, the oxidizer stream can include any suitably inert material and an<br><br>
appropriate amount of oxygen. The resulting mixture is combusted to produce a combustion product stream and heat. The combustion product stream drives a turbine which generates useful mechanical power. After mechanical power has been extracted, the combustion product-stream exits the turbine as an exhaust stream at a relatively lower pressure. Preferably, heat from the exhaust stream is transferred to the hydroshifting reaction zone. For example, heat from the exhaust stream can be utilized to vaporize the charged stream.<br>
The hydroshifted stream, gaseous fuel stream, and air mixture reduces the amount of nitrogen oxide in the flue gas in three ways. First, preferred hydroshifted streams, natural gas and many other volatile fuels do not contain any fixed nitrogen. Consequently, unlike a fuel containing fixed nitrogen, the combustion of those fuels creates very little additional nitrogen oxide. Second, the dihydrogen containing hydroshifted streams increase the limits of flammability of the combination of a hydroshifted stream and a gaseous fuel stream with air, so less are is required and little nitric oxide is formed from the nitrogen contained in the air. Third, at the temperature where most of the fuel burns, the equilibrium level of nitrogen oxide is lower, allowing for a large reduction in NOx by reactions herein above.<br>
In addition to providing a suitable reduction in levels of nitrogen oxides in stack gas of a new gas turbine, it is possible and cost-effective to retrofit the process to an existing gas turbine system.<br>
Naturally occurring or industrial waste air streams having a small amount of natural gas or other fuel in large amounts of air may also be used as a mixed air and fuel stream. Use of these materials may then result in NOx reduction, fuel savings, reduction in hydrocarbon emissions and reduction in the greenhouse effect. Examples of such waste air streams which could be used in this manner are coal mine ventilation exhaust air, paint booth exhaust, solvent drying air, air used to dry print<br><br>
produced   with   inks   which   have   hydrocarbon   solvents,   low concentration cob gas, and low concentration landfill gas.<br>
•<br>
While we have described a present preferred embodiment of the invention, it is to be distinctly understood that the invention is not limited thereto, but may be otherwise embodied and practiced within the scope of the following claims.<br>
In view of the features and advantages of the method and apparatus in accordance with this invention as compared to the known apparatus and method for reducing the nitrogen oxide emissions from gas turbine systems previously used, the following example is given.<br>
The following examples are presented in order to better communicate the invention. The examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Example 1. Preparation Of (Equation Removed)A three liter, three neck, round bottom flask equipped with a thermometer, a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer was charged with 1.2 liter of deionized water, 0.15 g-mole of sodium carbonate and 1.2 g-mole of sodium hydroxide to prepare an alkaline solution. A metal nitrate solution containing 0.20 g-mole of hydrated copper nitrate, 0.20 g-rhole of hydrated magnesium nitrate, 0.20 g-mole of hydrated aluminum nitrate, and 1.0 liter of water was prepared and added drop-wise to the alkaline solution while stirring over a period of 2 hours. The result was a gelatinous mixture having a pH of 8.77. After the addition was complete, the gelatinous mixture was heated to 85° C for 15 hours and then cooled. The cooled mixture was filtered, washed with water, and dried overnight under vacuum at 70° C. The dried product had a hydrotalcite-type structure.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Preparation of Cu2Mg2.Al207<br>
The dried material • described in Example 1 above was calcined by placing a known amount in an oven at room temperature and increasing the oven temperature at a rate of three degrees Celsius per minute until 550° C was achieved. The dried material was maintained at 550° C for four hours and then separated according to size by sieving. The product was a substantially amorphous material having a memory of the previous hydrotalcite-type structure. The product was designated Catalyst A. -<br>
Example 3. Preparation of (Equation Removed)<br>
A preparation procedure substantially identical to the procedure described in Example 1 above was performed except that this time the metal nitrate solution contained 0.30 g-mole of hydrated copper nitrate, 0.20 g-mole of hydrated zipc nitrate, 0.20 g-mole of hydrated aluminum nitrate and 1.0 liter of water. The resulting gelatinous mixture exhibited a pH of 8.25.<br>
Example 4. Preparation Of (Equation Removed)The material prepared in Example 3 above was calcined using the procedure described in Example 2 above. The product was designated Catalyst B.Example 5. Preparation of (Equation Removed)The procedure described in Example 1 was utilized again, except that the metal nitrate solution contained 0.325 g-mole of hydrated copper nitrate, 0.375 g-mole of hydrated zinc nitrate, 0.20 g-mole of hydrated aluminum nitrate, and1.0 liter of water.<br>
Example 6.<br>
Preparation of (Equation Removed)The material produced in Example 5 above was calcined according to the procedure described in Example 2. The calcined product was designated Catalyst C.<br>
Example 7. Commercially Obtained (Equation Removed)A commercially available material composed of about 40 per cent copper oxide, about 45 per cent zinc oxide, about 12 per cent alumina and about 3 per cent graphite binder by weight was ground and sieved to an appropriate mesh size. The sieved material was designated Catalyst D.<br>
Example 8. Commercially Obtained CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 plus Potassium<br>
Additional potassium in the form of an aqueous potassium carbonate solution was added to a portion of Sample D, which was described in Example 7 above, and then calcined at 550° C for four hours to produce a material designated Catalyst E containing 2.0 per cent potassium by weight.<br>
Example 9. Commercially obtained (Equation Removed)A commercially available material composed of about 58 per centcopper, about 25 per copper chromate, and about 2 per centgraphite binder by weight was ground and sieved to anappropriate mesh size. The sieved material wasdesignatedCatalyst F.<br>
Example 10. Hydroshifting Performance of Catalysts A through F<br>
At various times, each of the catalysts was loaded as a two cubic centimeter bed in a quartz tube reactor sealed within a stainless steel containment vessel and heated to 300° C under a nitrogen purge. When temperatures in the reactor had equilibrated, the nitrogen purge was terminated and a reduction gas stream containing 20 per cent hydrogen and 80 per cent nitrogen by volume was passed at atmospheric pressure through the reactor at 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute for a reduction period of at least two hours.<br>
Each of the reduced catalysts was purged with nitrogen for ten minutes in order to remove any residual hydrogen which might have remained within the reactor. Thereafter, a feed gas containing dimethyl ether, water and nitrogen in molar proportions of 1:3:2, respectively, was passed through tjie reactor at atmospheric pressure. The feed gas traveled through the reactor in substantially plug flow at 2000 gas hourly space velocity. External block heater temperature were controlled directly, and a thermocouple located at the midpoint of the bed was utilized as a control point for determining when the reactor temperature had stabilized.<br>
A reactor effluent stream left the reactor and entered an ice water cold trap which condensed and separated any unreacted water present in the effluent stream. The balance of the effluent stream was analyzed by gas chromatography and, based upon those analyses, conversions and selectivities were calculated. Tables 1 through 8 below present conversions, selectivities and hydrogen to carbon oxide ratios observed at various temperatures during periods of stable operation.<br><br>
TABLE 1: Catalyst A Performance(Table Removed)<br>
The data presented in Table 1 above indicates that Catalyst A, which is a copper, magnesium and alumina catalyst, provides acceptable dimethyl ether conversion with desirable selectivities, especially in the range of about 450° C to about 500° C operating temperature. However, the trend of the hydrogen to carbon oxide molar ratio is downward with increasing temperature.<br>
TABLE 2: Catalyst B Performance(Table Removed)<br>
Inspection of Table 2 reveals that Catalyst B, which is a copper, zinc and aluminum catalyst, is less active as compared to Catalyst A, but provides relatively higher selectivities for hydrogen and carbon dioxide. It appears that the zinc facilitates the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, with an attendant increase in hydrogen production.<br>
TABLE 3: Catalyst C Performance(Table Removed)<br>
Catalyst C is a copper, zinc and alumina catalyst, but having a higher metals content as compared to Catalyst B. Data in Table 3 indicate that the higher metals content catalyst is more active. Particularly, the 450° C data for Catalyst C represent a very attractive balance between conversion and selectivity.<br>
TABLE 4: Catalyst D Performance(Table Removed)<br>
Data in Table 3 demonstrate that Catalyst D, a commercially available catalyst containing copper, zinc and alumina, effectively hydroshifts dimethyl ether at temperatures of about 350° C to about 400° C. Catalyst D provides high conversions, desirable selectivities and good hydrogen to carbon oxide molar ratios.<br>
TABLE 5: Catalyst E Performance Temperature (°C) <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Data presented in Table 5 shows the effect of potassium, an alkali metal, on dimethyl ether hydroshifting performance. Catalyst E is substantially similar to Catalyst D, except that two per cent by weight of potassium has been impregnated and calcined on Catalyst E. The data in Tables 4 and 5 for Catalysts D and E, respectively, may be compared directly at 350° and at 400° C. The comparisons indicate that the presence of potassium causes a significant decrease in activity and selectivities.<br><br>
A commercially available catalyst having chromium as an active metal was evaluated under hydroshifting conditions. The resulting data is presented' as Table 6. The data indicates that a chromium-based catalyst can convert dimethyl ether and steam to a hydrogen and carbon oxides product with a relatively high selectivity for carbon dioxide.<br>
TABLE 6: Catalyst F Performance(Table Removed)<br>
Samples of the commercially available catalyst designated Catalyst D, described in Example 7 above, were observed under hydroshifting conditions at various steam rates. In each case, the space velocity of dimethyl ether charged to the reactor was controlled at 2000 GHSV and the space velocity of nitrogen charged to the reactor was controlled at 1000 GHSV. The amount of steam entering the reactor, if any, was adjusted to provide the desired dimethyl ether to steam molar ratio. The resulting data is presented below, as Table 7.<br>
TABLE 7:	Effect of Steam	Ratio on Catalyst D(Table Removed)<br>
Samples of the commercially available catalyst designated Catalyst D, described in Example 7 above, were also observed under hydroshifting conditions and at total pressure of about 100 psig. The molar proportions of dimethyl ether to steam and nitrogen charged to the reactor were nominally about 1 to 3. Space velocity of 3000 hr-1 GHSV was employed at 350° C and 400° C. The resulting data is presented below, as Table 8.<br>
TABLE 8: Catalyst D	at 100 Psig Total Pressure(Table Removed)<br><br>
Although a direct comparison is not possible due to a difference in the proportion of nitrogen charged, inspection of the data in Table 8 and the data in Table 7 indicates that the conversions and selectivities observed for Catalyst D are reasonably insensitive to changes in total pressure and can serve as guides for scale-up to higher pressure hydroshifting operation.<br>
Example 11.<br>
Samples of the commercially available catalyst designated Catalyst D, described in Example 7 above, were also observed under hydroshifting conditions and at total pressure of about 100 psig. The molar proportions of dimethyl ether to steam without nitrogen charged to the reactor were nominally about 1 to 3.   Space velocity of 4000 hr 1    (GHSV) was employed at temperatures in a range from 317° C to 407° C.    The resulting data is presented below, as Table 9.<br>
TABLE 9<br>
Catalyst D Performance at GHSV 4000 hr1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 12.<br>
Samples of the commercially available catalyst designated Catalyst D, described in Example 7 above, were also observed under hydroshifting conditions and at total pressure of about 100 psig. The molar proportions of dimethyl ether to steam without nitrogen charged to the reactor were nominally about 1 to 3. Space velocity of 8000 hr1 (GHSV) was employed at temperatures in a range from 347° C to 467° C. The resulting data is presented below, as Table 9.<br>
TABLE 10<br>
Catalyst D Performance at GHSV 8000 hr-1 with Feed H2O/DME/N2 of 3:1:0<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Data presented in Table 9 and Table 10 show that a carrier gas, such as nitrogen, is not essential to the hydroshifting process. Thermal NOx compounds are, therefore, not present in hydroshifted fuel (H2 and CO2). At GHSV levels of 4000 hr-1 and 8000 hr'l, respectively, levels of conversions and selectivites are, without nitrogen, suitable for commercial applications.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "predominantly" is defined as more than about fifty per cent. "Substantially" is defined as occurring with sufficient frequency or being present in such proportions as to measurably affect macroscopic properties of an associated compound or system. Where the frequency or proportion for such impact is not clear substantially is to be regarded as about twenty per cent or more. The term "Essentially" is defined as absolutely except that small variations which have no more than a negligible effect on macroscopic qualities and final outcome are permitted, typically up to about one percent.<br>
Examples have been presented and hypotheses advanced herein in order to better communicate certain facets of the invention. The scope of the invention is determined solely by the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
