The object of the present invention is an improved industrial process for the manufacture   of   butcnc-l    from    ethylene.<br>
Many patents describe methods for synthesising butene-1 by dimerization of ethylene. Among these patents the US-A-4 532 370 assigned to IFP describes a very high activity and selectivity catalyst for butene-1. In the process however, the spent catalyst must be deactivated and then removed from the reactor effluent by vaporising almost all of the effluent. The catalyst removal section needs special vaporising equipment such as for example thin   film   evaporators   to   vaporise   the   desired   product.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for manufacture of butene-1 by dimerization of ethylene comprising a very efficient catalyst removal section. The process of the invention in which about 99 vvt % of the reactor effluent is vaporised in two stages, first using an ordinary vaporiser and then thin film evaporator, has the advantage of liminng vaporisation duty on the thin film evaporator. This limitation decreases the plant cost significantly. Moreover, the vaporisation at high temperatures and pressures causes frequent fouling of vaporiser due to polymer properties modification at high temperature in the vaporiser. In the process of the invention, high temperatares are avoided so that fouling of the vaporiser is efficiently limited. Another very imponant advantage of the process of the present invention results from the possibility of using one or more thin film evaporators of limited size which leads to a limited plant cost.<br>
The invention thus concerns an improved process of making butene-1 by liquid phase homogeneous catalytic dimerization of ethylene, under a pressure between 0.-5 MP.n and 8 MPa with a temperature between 20"C aad 150°C, comprising a step of contacting a dimerizaticn reactor effluent vvith a catalyst inhibitor and a step of recovering a subslaniiaily catalyst free reactor effluent and a concentrated inactivated catalyst solution, said process is  characterized   by   the   steps  of:<br>
a)—sending a inhibited catalyst containing reactor effluent to a flash section where   the   pressure   is   decreased   of   about   0,1    MPa   to   about   2   MPa,   and<br><br>
obtaining a first gaseous phase containing ethylene and butcnc-1 and a first liquid   phase   containing   the   inhibited   catalyst,<br>
b)	sending the first liquid phase from step a) to at least one vaporisation section where it is vaporised under substantially the same pressure as in step a) and under a temperature which allows the separation of a second gaseous phase containing butenc-1 and ethylene from a second liquid phase containing    the    inhibited   catalyst,<br>
c)	sending the second liquid phase from step b) to at least one thin film evaporation section where it is evaporated under substantially the same pressure as in steps b) under conditions which allow the separation of a third gaseous phase containing ethylene, butene-1 and some other heavier hydrocarbon   products   from   a   concentrated   inactivated   catalyst   soimion.   and<br>
d)	collecting the first, second and third gaseous phases to form a gaseous reactor   effluent   substantially   free   of   spent   catalyst.<br>
In the dimerization process of ethylene, the reactor effluent always contains some heavy components such as C6 (mainly olefinic compouncLs) and C6+ (mainly octene) formed by side reaction in the reactor. The cataly.st remains dissolved in this heavy fraction and will be removed as a solution in this fraction.<br>
During the dimerization of ethylene, the reactor pressure is preferably between 1.5 MPa and 3 MPa and the temperature preferably between 30 °C and 70 °C and more preferably from about 50C to about 70 °C. The reactor effluent is contacted with a sufficient quantity of a catalyst inhibitor such for exam.ple an oxygen polar or a nitrogcii polar corapound to subsianiialiy deactivate the whole catalyst present in the effluent before sending this effluent to the flash section. Such nitrogen catalyst inhibitors are for example   described   in   the   european   patent   EP-B-200   654.<br>
Within    the    flash    section,   the    pressure    from    the    reactor   effluent   will    be<br>
      preferably  decreased  by  about 0.5  MPa  to  about   1   MPa,  In  this section.  due  to<br>
the   pressure   reduction,   a   part   of   the   effluent   is   vaporised.    Generally   the<br><br>
pressure drop is such that at least 5 wl %. for example 8 a 15 9c. of the affluent   coming   from   the   reactor   are   vaporised.<br>
The first liquid phase obtained in the flash section is sent to the vaporisation section which comprises one or more vaporisers. In this vaporisation section, the temperature is preferably between 60 °C and 100 °C and more preferably between 70 °C and 90 °C. Under these conditions, at least 50 wi %, for example 55 % to 81 %, of the reactor effluent are vaporised in this section.<br>
The second liquid phase recovered after the vaporisation section is sent to a thin film evaporation section which comprises at least one thin film evaporator and often two or more substantially identical thin film evaporators. In this section, a; most 25 wt %, for example 10 to 20 ^c oi the reactor   effluent    are    generally    vaporised.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the gaseous, substantiaiiv catalyst free reactor effluent is condensed to a liquid product which can be sent to a separation section where butene-1 is separated from ethylene. The condensation is generally done at the pressure of the gaseous product collected after each vaporisation step of the present invention. The liquid product obtained can be then pressurised to a pressure substantially identical to the dimerizution reactor pressure. This prcssurisation could be done with a centrifugal pump or   any   other   apparatus   well   known   in   the   art.<br>
The success of this new process scheme depends on the concentration of ethylene in the reactor effluent and how the maximum Vaporisation duly can be shifted towards vaporiser rather than towards thin film evaporators. Obviously, the vaporiser operating pressuic piay.s a key rule by shifting ine vaporisation duty. The butcnc-l process requiics almost lotal vaporisation of reactor effluent in order to remove the catalyst from the effluent and then total condensation before the distillation train. A low operating pressure favours vaporisation of the reactor effluent in the vaporiser while a high operating pressure favours recondensation of the reactor effluent in the recycle    column    feed    condenser,    especially    when     the    concentration    of<br><br>
ethylene is higher in the reactor effluent. This invention is based on the optimisation   of   these   vaporisation   and   condensation   pressures.<br>
According   to   this   invention,   a   thin   film   evaporator   is   used   to	only   remove   a<br>
small   amount   of  dissolved   catalyst   ;   therefore,   an   unnecessary	liquid   flow   to<br>
thin   film   evaporator   is   avoided.   The   catalyst   purge   from   the	bottom   of   the<br>
thin film evaporator contains about 13 wt %, for	example, of<br>
unvapourisablc    catalyst.<br>
The refrigeration duty required for the new process is minimised by optimising the cooling and chilled water flows and rearranging the pump-around coolers and recycle column feed condensers. A minimum chilled water temperature is desirable to condense all of the vapours produced in the catalysts removal section. The butene-1 reactor can be operated under such conditions that the ethylene concentration in the reactor effluent is 10 to 15 wt %, for example. At this low concentration of ethylene, after removing the catalyst, the reactor effluent can be recondcnscd, for example, at 1.3 MPa and 15 °C. This recondensed liquid is then pressurised to the desired recycle column operating pressure to separate ethylene from butcnc-1 and other heavy    components.<br>
According to this invention, preferably all the vapours from the catalysts removal section are recondensed at low pressure for example at 1.3 Mpa, because generally a liquid pump is used to raise the pressure of the reactor effluent from the low pressure to the pressure of the dimerization reaction that for example from 1.3 to 2.6 MPa. After fractionation, unreacted ethylene is recycled to the butene-1 reactor which operates for example around 2.3 Mpa.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention v/ithcut however limiting the   scope   thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example gives the details of material and energy balances of a butene-plant   according   to   this   invention.   The   example   covers   material   and   energy<br><br>
balances   of   11.7   MT/h   butene-1    in   the	reactor   effluent.   The   dimerization   of<br>
ethylene   is   done   at   a   temperature   of  53	°C   under   a   pressure   of  2.32   MPa   in<br>
the   presence   of  the   catalyst   described   in	the   example   1   of  the   IFP  patent   US-<br>
A-4 532 370.<br>
The reactor effluent pressure is dropped by 0.77 Mpa (from 2.32 MPa to 1.55 MPa) across a pressure control valve that vaporises about 10.1 wt % of reactor effluent and reduces the reactor effluent temperature by 11 C (from 53 °C to 42 °C). 5 kg of dccylamine as catalyst inhibitor is added to the hot reactor effluent to deactivate the catalyst prior to the depressurising step. The reactor effluent after the depressurising step is sent to a flash drum. The vapour stream, from the upper part, is recovered to be sent to at least one condenser. The liquid from the flash drum is then pumped into a vaporiser. The liquid from the flash drum is heated to 83 °C in the vaporiser. Since the pressure in the vaporiser is only 1.5 MPa, about 69.1 wt % of the reactor effluent is vaporised, at 83 °C. This scheme allows 3 MT/h of liquid, containing a small amount of catalyst, to flow to thin film evaporator section consisting of two thin film evaporators in series. The 95 wt % of this liquid is vaporised in the first and second thin film evaporators and about 5 wt % is removed as catalyst purge. The first, second and third streams from respectively the flash drum, the vaporiser and the thin film evaporators are then mixed to form a gaseous stream and then passed through two condensers connected in series. All the vapours are condensed at 1.31 MPa and 15 °C. The 15 °C condenser outlet temperature limitation is imposed by the available chilled water temperature (10°C). The materia! balance is shown   in   table   1   thereafter.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this example the dimerization conditions are identical to those of example 1 but the catalyst removal section pressure is further reduced. The catalyst removal section pressure is further dropped by 0.1 MPa (I bar) to 1.45 MPa, the liquid flow to thin film evaporator decreases from 3 to 2 MT/h, thus requiring even smaller thin film evaporator. One bar reduction in pressure reduces the thin film evaporator duty by 13 %, but the penalty has to be paid insofar as condensation of about 274 kg of vapours at 1.21 MPa and 15 °C is impossible. However, total condensation of these vapours is made at 1.21 MPa by   reducing   the   process   side   temperature   at   the   condenser   outlet   to   12 °C.<br><br><br>
