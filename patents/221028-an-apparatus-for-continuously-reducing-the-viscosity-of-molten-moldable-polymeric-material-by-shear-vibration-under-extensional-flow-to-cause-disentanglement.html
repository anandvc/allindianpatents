Titile:- An apparatus for continuously reducing the viscosity of molten moldable polymeric material by shear vibration under extensional flow to cause disentanglement,<br>
IBARJean - Pierre, , 169 Old Church Road, Greenwhich, CT 06830,-U.S.A.<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
PLASTICS  VISCOSITY  CONTROL METHOD AND APPARATUS CROSS-REFERENCE   TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
5	This     is     a     continuation-in-part     of    US     Patent<br>
Application No. 09/333,544 filed June 15, 1999 and entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL VISCOSITY OF MOLTEN PLASTICS PRIOR TO A MOLDING OPERATION, which is incorporated here by reference.<br>
10	FIELD AND BACKGROUND  OF THE  INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to molding with polymers, and in particular to a new and useful apparatus and method for controlling the viscosity of various polymeric materials by shear thinning and/or<br>
15 disentanglement, as well as special measures for controlling the viscosity of polymeric materials that are capable of crystallizing upon cooling at a temperature which prevents disentanglement to take place in the optimum conditions. This is the case for semi-crystalline polymers<br>
20   such as Nylon 66, for example.<br>
It is well known for molding polymeric materials that the processing parameters (e.g. temperatures, pressures, flow rates, flow length etc.) are a direct consequence of the viscosity of the melt which is governed by the state<br>
25   of entanglements of the macromolecules.  The resin "melt<br>
index" usually characterizes the fluidity of the melt and<br>
can be used to specify a certain resin grade suitable for<br>
       a given molding application. The melt index is afunction<br>
of the molecular weight of the macromoiecular chains and<br>
30   their degree of entanglement.   A high melt index<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br><br>
corresponds to a high flow resin. The mechanical performance of a molded product is also a strong function of its molecular weight characteristics, the longer the macromolecular chains the stronger and stiffer the final 5- article. Unfortunately the high strength required of plastics during their usage often results in a lack of fluidity during the molding operation, with as a result, high operational molding costs and molding defects (weld lines, sink marks etc.).  One accepted practice which is<br>
10 designed to compensate for this lack of control of melt fluidity includes decreasing the molecular weight of the macromolecules being molded. Although, this decreases the viscosity, improving the flow length significantly, it often results in a reduction of the mechanical properties,<br>
15 in particular strength and stiffness. Moreover, this practice cannot be used in those instances wherein the final molded product has to be very small and/or thin, such as in thin-wall injection molding applications.<br>
Resin suppliers have succeeded in providing the<br>
20 plastic industry with means to lower the viscosity to ease up processing or increase melt elasticity by blending grades of different molecular weights. The problem with that solution is that the mechanical performance of the lower molecular weight polymers is also severely reduced,<br>
25 a compromise for better processability which processors have to pay.<br>
The industry would welcome a process which allows the decrease of viscosity of plastic melts without the need to change the molecular weight of the resins, with the added<br>
30 advantage of a reduction in the number of grades a resin manufacturer has to offer.<br>
Shear thinning of plastic materials is well known and is used practically to lower the viscosity of melts during<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br><br>
the filling stage of injection molding by increasing the speed of the injecting piston. This is particularly useful in the case of thin wall injection molding where considerable forces are required to fill the mold when the 5   viscosity of the melt remains quasi-Newtonian.<br>
It is also well known that shear thinning can be obtained, at a given temperature, by either increasing the shear rate or the frequency of oscillation of the melt at constant amplitude of oscillation. In particular, it is<br>
10 well known that the viscosity of a plastic melt can be reduced by shear thinning induced by  vibration. See US Patent 4,793,954 to Lee; J.P. Ibar, " Melt Viscosity Reduction of Plastics by Vibration during Filling in Injection Molding", ANTEC 1997, Toronto, SPE Reprints<br>
15    (1997); and J.P. Ibar,  "Smart Processing of Plastics Through  Vibration  Controlled  Shear  Thinning  and Orientation",   1997  ASME  International  Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition. Reprint MD-Vol. 79, pp 223-348, 1997.<br>
20 Shear thinning does not invoke the same mechanism of viscosity reduction than what is required to produce long term viscosity reduction by disentanglement. See, for example, US Patent 5,885,495 to Ibar. Shear thinning results from the elastic cooperativity of the network of<br>
25	interactions between parts of the macromolecules called<br>
conformers. The viscosity reduction is instantaneous and only prevails under vibration, i.e. it ceases if the vibration ceases.  Shear thinning can be useful, however, and can be optimized or favored in a plastic according to<br>
30    the present invention, in ways that are not known or obvious to the person of ordinary skill in this field.<br>
Viscosity  reduction  induced  by  vibration-shear thinning is known. An example is described in J.P. Ibar,<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCIYUS00/16086<br><br><br>
"Smart Processing of Plastics Through Vibration Controlled Shear Thinning and Orientation", 1997 ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition.<br>
US Patent 5,885,495 teaches there are three categories 5   of known processes that use vibration to modify the molding process and/or the properties of molded materials:<br>
1.	Mechanical shaking/oscillation or ultrasonic<br>
vibration devices to homogenize and increase the density<br>
of the material molded, either in the liquid stage or in<br>
10 the solidifying stage, either at a macroscopic or microscopic level See US Patent 4,288,398 to Lemelson; US Patent 3,298,065 to Pendleton; and US Patent 4,925,161 to Allen et al. These patents do not directly concern the use of vibration to lower the viscosity of a melt to<br>
15 increase their processability during conversion, nor do they address the use of packing vibration to increase the melt elasticity.<br>
2.	Processes based on the fact that material rheology<br>
is a function of vibration frequency and amplitude in<br>
20   addition to temperature and pressure:   See US Patent 4,469,649; EP Patent 0 273 830; US Patent 5,306,129; US Patent 4,919,870; CA Patent 1,313,840; and EP Patent 0 274 317; all to Ibar. The teachings in these patents, however, do not alter the viscosity of the melts in a way which<br>
25 preserves the viscosity reduction nor do they optimize shear thinning effects by the introduction of ribs on the surface to create oscillating extension flow.<br>
3.	Processes using vibration to generate heat locally<br>
by internal friction or to decrease surface stresses at the<br>
30 wall interface between the melt and the barrel or the die to increase throughputs: See Casulli et al. "The Oscillating Die: A Useful Concept in Polymer Extrusion" Polym. Eng. Sci.; 30 (23), 1551 (1990) and Wong et al.<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
"Flow of Thermoplastics in an Annular Die under Parallel Oscillations", Polym. Eng. Sci.; 30 (24), 1574 (1990), for example. These processes do not try to modify the viscosity of the melt per se, in a way which would be 5 similar to a reduction of the molecular weight average of the macromolecules.<br>
The polymer molding industry would greatly welcome an apparatus and/or method which decreases the viscosity of macromolecules without changing their mechanical 10 performance. Such a process is described in US Patent 5,885,495 to Ibar where the macromolecules are pulled apart to produce the disentanglement effect which is responsible for the lowering of viscosity.<br>
In general, in order to use frequencies for the<br>
15   oscillating extensional flow which remain economically<br>
feasible to practice industrially, it is necessary to lower<br>
the temperature of the melt to a temperature zone well<br>
within the rubbery flow region of the polymer.<br>
For .amorphous polymers, the lowest possible 20 temperature limit to enable flow to take place is the glass transition temperature of the polymer, Tg. Below that temperature, the polymer is no longer a melt and becomes a solid glass which does not flow. For such polymers, it is generally possible to find a disentanglement processing 25 temperature well above Tg at which the polymer can still flow and be treated mechanically at constant temperature according to US Patent 5,885,495.<br>
Semi-crystalline polymers, such as Nylon 66, are amorphous melts above their temperature of crystallization, 30 Tc, and solids presenting a crystallographic structure below Tc. In general, the glass transition temperature of the remaining amorphous phase present, which co-exists with the crystalline phase, is located much below Tc, hence<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
in the solid state of the polymer. For such semi-crystalline polymers, the disentanglement processing window is restricted since it can only be located above Tc.<br>
For some semi-crystalline polymers, such as ENGAGE 5 8180, a trademark for  a metallocene Polyethylene polymer sold by Dupont-Dow Elastomers LLP, the amount of entanglement is so high, and the resulting elasticity of the melt is so sensitive to the effect of a shear oscillation, that manageable low mechanical frequencies<br>
10 (below 50 Hz) are able to bring the melt in the optimized elastic region favorable to extensive shear-thinning capable of producing disentanglement .[2], even at temperatures well above the crystallization temperature. For instance, the crystallization temperature Tc for ENGAGE<br>
15 8180 is 60°C, and the most favorable temperature range which optimizes shear-thinning capable of producing disentanglement is between 110°C and 160°C. As a consequence, there is no interference or limitation from the phenomenon of crystallization in obtaining high elastic<br>
20 state for a flowable, extrudable ENGAGE 8180. This is not the case for other semi-crystalline polymers, such as Nylon 66, for which desirable high elastic states cannot be obtained, under the effect of combined shear oscillation (of manageable frequency) and temperature, at temperatures<br>
25   above the crystallization temperature Tc of the polymer.<br>
For such semi-crystalline polymers, temperature cannot be<br>
lowered enough before crystallization temperature is<br>
reached, which interferes with the disentanglement process.<br>
The present invention is a new apparatus and method<br>
30 which applies the disentanglement process taught in US Patent 5,885,495 for use on an industrial scale and which also identifies additional measures involving temperature control and shear thinning techniques that are novel and<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086 <br>
unobvious over the prior art.<br>
The present invention overcomes the prior art problems and shortcomings in a method and apparatus which produces 5 a novel product wherein extensional shear vibration is exercised on a molten plastic as it is continuously extruded to pass through treatment stations at determined temperature, frequency and amplitude of vibration, during a certain time and under specific vibrating conditions for<br>
10 each station, to obtain a controlled degree of shear-thinning (elastic state) susceptible to result in a progressive decrease of the entanglements between the macromolecules, in order to significantly and controllably decrease the viscosity of the extruded melt in a manner<br>
15 which can be beneficial to future molding operations requiring a lower melt viscosity.<br>
A method and apparatus are disclosed for decreasing in a continuous way the viscosity of molten polymers, such as a metallocene polyethylene or polycarbonate, prior to<br>
20 or during a molding operation such as injection molding, extrusion, thermofonaing, blow molding or compounding. When a significant reduction of viscosity is desirable, the plastic melt is submitted to the action of a specific mechanical extensional shear vibration, with minimum or no<br>
25 external pressure, within a specific range of amplitude and frequency of melt oscillation to cause the melt to become highly elastic, and simultaneously to be fatigued in extensional flow conditions for a certain time, maintaining this high elastic state which corresponds to a high degree<br>
30   of shear-thinning, until the macromolecules have partially<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US0O/160S6<br><br>
or totally disentangled, in a controllable manner, at which stage the melt is ready for a molding operation such as a simple quenching operation or an extrusion process followed by quenching to produce pellets or compounds with a better 5 mix or a lower viscosity when remelted, or an injection molding or similar molding operation where the melt viscosity has been greatly reduced allowing a better processability of the injected part, for instance allowing the use of a  lower temperature of injection, a lower<br>
10 pressure of injection or both, or even in a value gate or extruder where surfaces of the rod, stem, rotor or screw of these units can be equipped with the rib means of the present invention and move according to the present invention to achieve the shear-thinning and viscosity<br>
15   reduction effect.<br>
Accordingly, one object of this invention is to provide a molding apparatus and/or method which can reduce the viscosity of melt in a given controllable degree by shear-thinning/disentanglement of the macromolecules while<br>
20   the resin is in the melt.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a molding apparatus and/or method which can continuously produce reduced viscosity resins which can be either stored and bagged as special low melt viscosity producing pellets<br>
25   or pumped to another molding site for immediate use.<br>
These and other objects are achieved through the advent of a novel apparatus and/or a method of using the same. The novel apparatus includes, among other things, at least one station which defines a cavity, the treatment<br>
30 cavity, wherein a molten moldable material can pass into and/or flow through it to be treated to produce at least partially disentangled melts or even melts that are only subjected to shear thinning, e. g. according to the process<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
described in US Patent 5,885,495.<br>
The treatment station of the apparatus includes means for exerting a shear drag at given strain rate of the molten moldable material as it flows through from the inlet 5   to the outlet of the treatment station.<br>
The treatment station includes rib means for exerting<br>
a variation of the shear strain rate of the molten moldable<br>
material as it flows through from the inlet to the outlet<br>
of the treatment station such that it produces extensional<br>
10   acceleration/deceleration of the flow.<br>
The apparatus includes means to move the melt, e.g. to continuously push and/or drag and/or. pump the melt located in the station treatment cavity from the inlet conduit towards its outlet conduit. 15 Also included in this apparatus are means to vary the gap which the molten, moldable material can pass and/or flow through.<br>
Also  included  in  the  apparatus  are  means  to continuously vent the treatment cavity to prevent the 20   formation of bubbles or cavitation during the treatment. The apparatus also includes various known monitoring and control devices for temperature, pressure, torque exerted on the molten moldable material contained within the treatment cavity(s). 25        Another object of the present invention to provide a novel method of processing semi-crystallizable polymers in order to disentangle their melt without the interference of crystallization by varying the temperature during the shear  thinning  or  disentanglement  treatment  in  a 30   controllable way which pushes down to a lower temperature the beginning of crystallization and, therefore, allows the use of lower temperatures for increasing the elasticity of the melt by the shear oscillation methods.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention pertains to apparatuses for 30   reducing the viscosity of  moldable materials (e.g.,<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/I6086 <br>
polymers) through disentanglement processes. It also pertains to methods of using such apparatuses.<br>
The apparatus encompassed by the present invention includes at least one slit cavity, the treatment cavity, 5 where molten moldable material flows through Under conditions where shear vibration under extensional flow takes place to enable disentanglement to occur. The apparatus is not limited to any specific cavity design nor configuration, provided laminar flow without turbulence or<br>
10 cavitation prevails. For instance, the cavity can have a constant gap or a variable gap. The cavity can have sections of constant gap followed by sections of variable gaps. The gap cross section dimensions at any given point of the flow path determine the strain and strain rate of<br>
15 deformation on the molten moldable material at that point. Examples of calculation of strain and strain rate as a function of gap geometry can be found in J.D. Ferry, "Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers", Appendix C, page 640, Second Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY. Library of<br>
20 Congress Catalog Card#: 76-93301. For an annulus (circular slit), the gap cross-section is determined by the radius and height of the gap. Pressure drop, shear stress at the wall and flow rate are a strong function of melt viscosity which varies with strain rate, temperature and gap profile.<br>
25 In summary, the gap profile is crucial not only to determine the extent of flow, i.e. the throughput, but also to implement a certain type of flow. For instance, a gap convergence creates an acceleration of flow, and its extension. Conversely, a gap divergence translates into a<br>
30 deceleration and a contraction of flow. Obviously, a succession of restriction and enlargement of the gap, in the pathway of a flowing molten moldable material, results in a periodic variation of the  strain rate  from<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
acceleration to deceleration, and of the strain from extension to contraction. If ribs are regularly disposed on at least one surface in contact with a melt flowing in .the gap created by two adjacent surfaces, a periodic shear 5 oscillation under extensional flow is created which, according to the present invention, can be set to produce a high elastic state (shear-thinning) favorable to induce disentanglement effects, using operating conditions of strain rate and strain taught  in US Patent 5,885,495.<br>
10 Upon reading this specification, those skilled in the art will know what types of slit geometry and configuration can be used when practicing the invention. For instance, the disentanglement treatment cavity can be an extrusion barrel/screw die or valve gate bushing/rod modified to<br>
15 incorporate the rib means features capable of bringing the melt in the processing window region required by US Patent 5,885,495 to produce disentanglement. This can be done by re-designing the screw profile and the gap between the barrel and the screw and by adding specifically designed<br>
20 ribs and/or grooves on both the inside surface of the barrel and on the screw. The modified screw rotates inside the close fitting barrel, shearing the molten moldable material over the profiled gap. A multiple screw treatment cavity can be built wherein the screw flights intermesh.<br>
25 When it is the case, the action of the intermeshed screw is, in addition to producing a vibrational flow under extension, to move forward the molten moldable material due to positive displacement, in a way somewhat similar to that of a gear pump. Single screw cavity and nonintermeshing<br>
30 multiple screw disentanglement cavities lack this positive displacement, but the ribs and grooves can be spaced and positioned with respect to the rotation motion such that a longitudinal strain rate is added to that caused by<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086 <br>
pressure flow. Upon reading this specification, those skilled in the art will know what types of ribs and grooves can be added to an extrusion barrel and screw dies in order to practice the .invention and create a pumping 5   effect at the same time.           Use of the invention in a valve gate is discussed later in this disclosure, in connection with FIG. 22.<br>
In general, the preferred treatment cavity design of<br>
the present invention will depend, in part, upon the nature<br>
10   of the resin to be elasticized or disentangled,  the<br>
throughput desired and the resources available to the<br>
practitioner of the invention. For instance, if enough<br>
resources are available, an apparatus comprising multi<br>
disentanglement  stations  is  desirable  wherein  each<br>
15   individual station is set to optimize throughput, not<br>
disentanglement efficiency, but viscosity reduction is<br>
compounded at each station to yield a final disentangled<br>
melt, produced at fast rate, with the proper final<br>
viscosity reduction ratio. For instance, a 5 station<br>
20   disentanglement apparatus, working at a low efficiency rate<br>
of 27.5% per station (μout/μin - 0.725), produces a melt with<br>
final viscosity reduction of 5, which is (0.725)"5. The<br>
throughput of such a multi station disentanglement<br>
apparatus is many times greater than the troughput of a<br>
25   single station working to produce the same result in terms<br>
of viscosity reduction. The operating cost per weight<br>
produced is also greatly reduced.<br>
The inlet through which the molten moldable material passes through the treatment cavity is connected to at 30 least one feeder for preparing a molten, moldable material. The feeder is spaced from the treatment cavity and any other feeder which may be present. The feeder includes a means for expelling the molten, moldable material through<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
its outlet. This expelling action can be accomplished by any suitable means known to those skilled in the art. Some examples of feeders which include such an expelling means include, without limitation, screw pumps as used in 5 extrusion and in injection molding apparatuses, twin screws as used with blends, plungers as used in two-stage molding apparatuses, gear pumps, and the like. This expelling action can include means to pressure pulse the melt to facilitate flow, as described in References [12,13,14-<br>
10    16,19,20], although such a conditioning is not required by the present invention.<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention for the apparatus to include a plurality of feeders. If a plurality of feeders are employed, the molten, moldable material<br>
15   prepared in each need not be the same.  For example, each feeder can contain the same material.  They can also contain the same material but at a different temperature, and/or different molecular weight characteristics, and/or different degree of disentanglement.  Specifically, one<br>
20 material in one feeder may be a highly disentangled fraction coming from a different treatment station (downstream or else), whereas another material may be less disentangled. This changes the concentration of disentangled fractions and allows to engineer specific<br>
25 bimodal blends of grades having different states of disentanglement. The separate feeders can also contain materials which are virgin in one and recycled in another. Moreover, the individual feeders can contain completely different materials or materials which are filled or<br>
30   unfilled with fibers, fillers (such as wood, flour or ESD powder to name a few), different concentration of blends of polymers and/or polymers/liquid crystal polymers, pigments, anti-oxidants, flame retardant compounds, and the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16O86<br><br>
like, and/or any combination thereof. The second or third feed can be introduced into the disentanglement system at any inlet stage of the multi stations which chain up head to tail to continuously produce disentangled melts of given 5   viscosity characteristics.     The apparatus can also include at least one accumulator for collecting the treated molten, moldable material before it is sent to either a pelletizer system or to a pumping station. In one embodiment of the present<br>
10 invention, the accumulator defines a cavity which continues to shear the collected disentangled melt and contains a series of immersed intermeshed rollers with ribs on their surface to preserve and maintain the state of disentanglement until the melt is pumped out of the<br>
15   accumulator by the controlled activation of a screw pump or a gear pump.   One non-limiting example of such disentanglement retaining means is the device illustrated by FIG. 8. In another embodiment of the present invention, the disentangled melt is pumped to a pelletizer line which<br>
20 quickly freezes the disentangled melt into pellets which are dried and bagged, ready for shipment. Any type of pelletizer line can be used. Upon reading this specification, those skilled in the art will know what type of pelletizer line can be added to the accumulator to<br>
25 freeze the state of disentanglement obtained through the treatment in order to practice the invention.<br>
The treatment station includes means for exerting a shear vibration coupled with extensional flow on the molten, moldable material contained within the treatment<br>
30 cavity. The vibration is either created. through direct oscillating means or indirectly, through the rotation of at least one profiled surface {i.e. with rib means) in contact with the molten moldable material. In other words,<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
even pure continuous rotation in only one direction can locally oscillate the melt because of the presence of the rib means which periodically and locally accelerate and decelerate the melt as it moves past the ribs, bumps or 5 grooves in the treatment gap. In one embodiment of the invention, a shaft supporting a surface in contact with the molten moldable material is oscillated by means known to a person in the art or any combination of them. A rotary vibration can be  induced by hydraulic,  pneumatic,<br>
10 electrical, electromagnetic means and the use of cams, connecting rods, and/or crankshafts. Any skilled person in the art will know how to create a rotary oscillation of frequency between 1 Hz and 100 Ez and of amplitude between 0.1 and 20 degrees, depending on the overall dimensions of<br>
15 the device. The periodic motion created does not require to be a pure sine wave and can be a mixture of several sine waves to create such periodic oscillation as square waves, triangular waves and the like.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
20 oscillation of the shaft connected to at least one surface in contact with the molten moldable material is coupled with a continuous rotation of the shaft, occurring at a certain rotation per minute. The coupling of the two motions can be done by programming the combined motion<br>
25 profile, which corresponds to a modulated rotation, and requesting the PID controller to follow the desired signal. But this solution may require extraneous efforts from the electric motors or hydraulic actuators and, in another embodiment of the present invention, the two motions are<br>
30 implemented from separately independent means, such as two electrical motors, and combined through an epicycle differential to recreate the modulated rotation on the shaft of the treatment cavity.  In yet another embodiment<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086 <br>
of the present invention, two oscillatory motions of different frequency and amplitude are combined through the epicyclic differential to optimize shear vibration and extensional fatigue of the molten moldable material in 5   order to practice the invention.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to enable a shear vibration under extensional flow to occur with a full control of the strain rate and of the acceleration and deceleration of the shear strain.  US Patent 5,885,495<br>
10 teaches how to set both the frequency and amplitude of a shear vibration at a given temperature to achieve a high elastic state of the melt producing extensive shear-thinning favorable for producing disentanglement of the macromolecules and obtain a reduction of melt viscosity.<br>
15 But strain, strain rate and strain acceleration are the derivative of one another and cannot be set independently. As explained earlier, the use of ribs and/or grooves and/or bumps (collectively and separately here called "rib means") to profile- and modulate the gap dimension, in conjunction<br>
20 with the relative motion of the surfaces which carry those ribs/grooves, allows to further control the degree of extensional flow, melt fatigue and melt flow acceleration/deceleration. The number of ribs/grooves, the spacing between the ribs/grooves, the height of the<br>
25   ribs/grooves, the width of the ribs/grooves, the surface area of the ribs versus the surface area of the grooves, are all interrelated parameters of the present invention, which are set to create a high elastic state in the melt to produce a large viscosity reduction and disentanglement.<br>
30 The addition of rib means increases to 3 or 4 degrees of freedom (depending on whether one or two surfaces are structured with ribs/grooves) instead of 2 in US 5,855,495, the ability to apply to the melt a chosen strain rate,<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCTAJS00/16086<br><br>
strain amplitude and frequency of shear vibration under extensional fatigue. The advantage of the extra degree (s) of freedom can be used, in a specific embodiment of the present invention, to optimize viscosity-reduction and 5 disentanglement effects, i.e. reduce the energy required to disentangle a certain quantity of entangled resin and/or increase the throughput by accelerating the kinetics. Upon reading this specification, those skilled in the art will know how to calculate the dimensions of the<br>
10 ribs, their number and the speed of rotation of the lateral dragging flow to produce the desired and controlled strain rate and acceleration/deceleration in the treatment cavity in order to practice the invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
15 ribs/bumps top surface is curved to smooth out any sharp angle which could be detrimental to the flow, in particular with regard to non linear flow defects which might arise from unsmoothed angles including the formation of micro-bubbles. Specifically, the shape of the bumps/ribs is to<br>
20   avoid such non linear flow defects.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the shape and relative disposition (pitch) of the ribs/bumps is determined by their ability to create local stress fields which can percolate into a cooperative<br>
25 network for specific conditions of rotation speed Q, frequency ω and amplitude a of shear vibration, and temperature. That is the stress fields of one rib must overlap that of an adjacent rib.<br>
Also included in this apparatus are means  for<br>
30 continuously moving the melt, e.g. to drag "and/or pump the melt located in the station treatment cavity from the inlet conduit towards its outlet conduit. This is accomplished by means of the disposition of the ribs with respect to the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
rotational flow direction. If the ribs are disposed perpendicular to the rotation direction, the molten moldable material is dragged in that direction and any motion in the longitudinal direction is due to pressure 5 flow exerted at the inlet of the treatment , cavity. Pressure might have a negative effect on shear-thinning and/or the kinetics of disentanglement and, for this reason, should be maintained in the range which does not adversely affect the treatment. By orienting the ribs by<br>
10 a certain angle with respect to the axis of rotation, it is possible to create a longitudinal drag component with its own strain rate and acceleration. This longitudinal component of the rotational motion creates a pumping effect which reduces the pressure required to produce certain flow<br>
15   rate and contributes to the transport and disentanglement<br>
of the molten moldable material.   Upon reading this<br>
specification, those skilled in the art will know what ribs<br>
. orientation will produce the desired and controlled pumping<br>
effect in the treatment cavity in order to practice the<br>
20   invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the surface profile of ribs/grooves is created by machining and grooving the surface of the treatment cavity permanently and in another embodiment of the present invention, foils<br>
25 of profiled strips which are manufactured separately are laid over and firmly mounted, for instance tack-welded on the body of the treating surfaces. In one embodiment of the present invention the strips are made of a metallic material and, in another embodiment, they are made of any<br>
30 other material capable of sustaining the combination of shear forces, vibration and temperature required for the treatment.<br>
The treatment station includes means for varying the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
amplitude of the shear vibration applied on the molten mcldable material as it flows through from the inlet to the outlet of the treatment station. US Patent 5,885,495 teaches that slippage may occur at high amplitude of me.lt 5 shear oscillation which disrupts the efficiency of the-disentanglement process. When the desired amplitude for disentanglement is applied all at once, the risks of slippage are increased, which suggests to gradually increase the strain amplitude of vibration until the<br>
10 correct combination of frequency-temperature and strain % is obtained. In a discontinuous process, such as described in US Patent 5,885,495, the settings and parameters are programmed to vary gradually, which avoids the slippage problem. Specifically, the strain % of the shear vibration<br>
15 is increased little by little in step-wise fashion, given a certain temperature and frequency of oscillation. Likewise, at a given temperature and strain %, the frequency is increased little by little until the desired combined  .setting  is  achieved.  For  a  continuous<br>
20 disentanglement process, the gradual increase of the strain % can be accomplished by a gradual change of the geometry of the gap along the pathway of melt flow. The strain amplitude is function of the gap geometry, as explained before. For example, one can increase the shear strain %<br>
25 by increasing the radius of the cylinders of the annulus which form the gap. Specifically, a preferred embodiment of the present invention uses a pair of concentric conic surfaces for defining the gap in the treatment cavity. This preferred embodiment offers the added advantage of<br>
30 being able to easily change the gap dimension by pulling the inner cone surface with respect to the outside cone surface. Gaps between 0.5mm and 5mm can be obtained that way, which can be adjusted on the fly as the molten<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/I6086 <br>
moldable material flows in the treatment cavity. Another preferred embodiment consists of concentric cylindrical surfaces whose radius increases in stages as flow proceeds from, the inlet to the outlet of the treatment cavity. 5 In one specific embodiment of the present invention, the gap height is automatically adjustable through an actuator and a controller allowing an increase or decrease of the gap at intermittent intervals/ thus modulating the gap dimension in a controllable way.<br>
10 Also included in this apparatus is a means for controlling the temperature of the material within the feeder(s), accumulator(s) and/or treatment cavity. Any suitable temperature controlling means can be employed when practicing this invention.<br>
15 Examples of suitable temperature control means include, without limitation, the implementation of the following: (a) hot and cold" oil circulated through passages in the injection machine, the accumulator/ the injection nozzle and/or the mold, (b) resistance cartridges<br>
20 positioned within the injection machine, the accumulator, the injection nozzle and/or the mold, (c) hot pipes inserted into the injection machine/ the accumulator, the injection nozzle, and the mold, and/or (d) fluid which is embedded in the injection machine, the accumulator, the<br>
25 injection nozzle and/or the mold and whose temperature can be controlled by dielectric means. Those skilled in the art will be able to select the temperature controlling means which best suits their needs after reading this specification.<br>
30 Also included in this apparatus is a means for controlling the pressure of the molten moldable material within the feeder (s), accumulator(s) and/or disentangle¬ment treatment cavities.  In particular, the rate of flow<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
in the screw pump(s), gear pump(s), treatment cavities and extruder can be controlled by melt pressure in the treatment cavity measured by pressure sensors and transducers. Any suitable pressure controlling means can 5 . be employed when practicing this invention. Those skilled in the art will be able to select the pressure controlling means which best suits their needs after reading this specification.<br>
Also included in this apparatus is a means for<br>
10 monitoring and/or controlling the torque of the material within the treatment cavity. The torque is directly related to the modulus of the molten moldable material being treated and reflects the state of viscosity. Any suitable torque monitoring and/or controlling means can be<br>
IS   employed when practicing this invention.<br>
Examples of suitable torque control means include,<br>
without limitation, the implementation of the following:<br>
(a) measure of the current used by the motor (s) to maintain<br>
a given rotation speed of the shaft driving the relative<br>
20 motion of at least one surface in contact with the molten moldable material to be disentangled, (b) installation of a shear stress transducer at the end of the treatment cavity, (c) measure of the speed of transmission and attenuation of ultrasonic acoustic waves through the gap<br>
25 in the treatment cavity. Those skilled in the art will be able to select the torque controlling means which best suits their needs after reading this specification.<br>
In addition to the above, the apparatus can include many different optional features.   For example,  the<br>
30 apparatus can include a purge valve which can be positioned between the accumulator(s) and the mold and/or between the feeder (s) and the accumulator(s) .<br>
Another optional feature which can be included in the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br><br>
present invention is a mixing chamber positioned in the pathway of the inlet to the treatment cavity and/or at the outlet of the treatment cavity. This mixing chamber, which can consist of a static mixer in one preferred embodiment, 5 can homogenize the temperature and the viscosity of the molten moldable material, and optimize the mixing of the different slices of the molten moldable material treated in the gap of the treatment cavity. In the case several feeders are used, the mixing chamber creates a more 10   homogeneous mix of the different ingredients.<br>
Specific embodiments of this invention are illustrated in the figures. These illustrations are merely examples of manners in which to practice the invention. They are, in no way, intended to limit the scope of this invention. 15 Other objects, aspects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification and the appended claims which follow.<br>
A more complete appreciation of the present invention,<br>
20   and many of the attendant advantages thereof, will be<br>
readily ascertained as the invention becomes better<br>
understood by reference  to  the  following detailed<br>
description,  when considered in connection with the<br>
accompanying figures briefly described below.<br>
25       Referring now to FIGS. 1A to 1F, FIG. 1A is a<br>
schematic " illustration  of  one  embodiment  of  a<br>
disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the<br>
present invention having a single feeder 4 and a single<br>
treatment cavity 3, between an undersurface 2 of a top<br>
30   member 54 and a top surface 56 of a bottom member 58<br>
wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow is<br>
produced by rotating at constant speed and/or at modulated<br>
speed and/or by pure oscillation an incoming melt 1 which<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
flows outwards over ribs or rib means 5 disposed on at least one surface 2. The molten moldable material 1 flows circularly from the center of the disk to the rim where a doctor blade collects it and a gear pump positively 5   displaces it away from the treatment cavity.  The cavity gap 3 is structured by the ribs 5 which can be shaped and configured in a variety of ways, as shown in FIGS, 1C, 1D, 1E and 1F, specifically designed to exert the maximum control over the strain rate,  strain rate periodic 10   variation with given frequency and extensional strain as the melt flows over the rib means from the inlet to the outlet and in order to optimize its disentanglement.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, one surface in contact with the melt rotates at constant speed<br>
15 Ώ and the other surface is fixed. The strain rate is locally modulated by the presence of the ribs which create the extensional vibration required to produce the high elastic state responsible for shear-thinning and, in time, disentanglement effects.  The number of ribs, the spacing<br>
20 between them (pitch) the height of the ribs, the width of the ribs, and the height of the gap in between the ribs are all interrelated parameters of the present invention, which must be specifically designed in order to produce the adequate periodic strain rate with proper frequency, strain<br>
25 amplitude and frequency capable of producing disentanglement effects, as taught in US 5,855,495. For instance, for a gap height between 0.5 and 4mm, rib height can be -approximately 25% of gap height and rib width 50% of gap height. The number of ribs, to be spaced regularly,<br>
30 depends on the strain and frequency required to increase elasticity/shear-thinning for the disentanglement process and on the speed of rotation which determines angular, and thus tangential velocity across the ribs.  When the space<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br><br>
between the ribs is relatively important, care should be taken to design the ribs corners and shape angles to avoid local turbulence and other non linear flow defects. FIGS. 1A to IF show several possible geometries for the ribs 5. 5 In one embodiment of the invention (FIG. IF) , the height of the ribs is not constant across the radius and increases slightly from the center of the disk to the edge, or vice versa. In another embodiment of the present invention, the ribs surface is not flat but is, instead, grooved at 10 regular intervals perpendicular to the radial direction of flow (FIGS. 1C and 1D).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the moving surface is not rotating but oscillates back and forth with a certain amplitude a and frequency ω. Yet, in 15   another embodiment of the present invention a combination of oscillation and constant rotation is exerted on the moving surface. The value of the amplitude and frequency of vibration and the value of the melt temperature are determined according to US Patent 5,885,495 in order to 20   increase the amount of elasticity in the melt, and through shear-thinning.  The constant speed of rotation Ώ is also determined to bring the melt within the proper processing window for disentanglement to occur, and its value is adjusted, along with the number of ribs, the geometry of 25   the ribs and their disposition with respect to melt flow direction,in order to optimize disentanglement, that is to say favor the kinetics of viscosity reduction to make it as efficient as possible in the shortest time as possible. 30       in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, both surfaces in contact with the molten moldable material have ribs and/or grooves.   Yet, in another important embodiment of the present invention, both<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
surfaces in contact with the molten moldable material are in controlled independent motion. In this case, although the apparatus is more complicated to design and operate, disentanglement is more efficient and occurs deeper 5 throughout the cavity gap, allowing the use of wider gaps which results in increased productivity.<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B are schematic illustrations of one embodiment of a disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention having a single 10 feeder and a single treatment cavity, wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow is produced by feeding a molten moldable material 3 through a gap .(also identified by numeral 3) composed of at least one rotating and/or oscillating surface 6 or 7 presenting on its contour a 15 profile over which the molten material flows and/or can be dragged and/or is being pushed through and/or pumped through.   In FIG. 2B the outside surface 6 may be<br>
rotated/oscillated at constant speed Ώ and constant<br>
frequency "and amplitude of oscillation (when oscillation 20   is added) and the other e.g. cylindrical surface 7 may be fixed, or, conversely, surface 7 may be rotated/oscillated (FIG. 2A) at constant speed and surface 6 may be fixed, or, both surfaces may be rotated/oscillated independently. The strain rate is locally modulated by the presence of ribs 25   and/or grooves on either surface 6 and 7, or on both surfaces, which create the extensional and fatigue flow with vibration required to produce disentanglement effects. As already emphasized, the number of ribs/grooves, the height of the ribs/grooves, the width of the ribs/grooves, 30   are all inter-related parameters of the present invention, which must be specifically designed in order to produce the adequate strain rate,  strain amplitude and frequency capable of producing disentangle-ment effects, as taught<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>

in US Patent 5,855,495. For instance, the rib on one surface might be a continuous bump configured as a right helix, whereas its counterpart on the facing surface across the gap. is another helix with same pitch but turning left. 5 The two helices can be grooved at an angle with the axis of the helix to produce a periodic variation of the gap height along the helix rib top surface. In such a case, when the two surfaces are put in relative motion, by the rotation of at least one surface, the melt is not only<br>
10 sheared and oscillated under extensional flow but also dragged through towards the exit end. The molten moldable material 3 flows helicoidally from the inlet of the treatment cavity, at the left of FIG. 2A, toward the outlet, at the right, where it is collected and a gear pump<br>
15 positively displaces it away from the treatment cavity, or it is used to fill a mold cavity which happens when the invention is applied in conjunction with a valve gate system in hot runner applications, for example. The cavity gap 3 is .profiled by the ribs which can be shaped and<br>
20 configured in a variety of ways, as already shown in FIGS. 1A to IF, specifically designed to exert the maximum control over the strain rate, strain rate variation and extensional strain as the melt flows from the inlet to the outlet and in order to optimize viscosity reduction and<br>
25 disentanglement. Band heaters 8 are located around the metallic surfaces defining the cavity and are controlled by thermocouples (not shown in FIG. 2A) in PID control loops .32.<br>
The apparatus of the invention as illustrated in FIGS.<br>
30 2A and 2B thus is for continuously reducing the viscosity of molten moldable polymeric material 3 by shear vibration under extensional flow to cause shear-thinning conditions ideal for disentanglement, the apparatus including at least<br><br>

10 molten moldable material 3 can flow and/or can be dragged and/or is being pushed through and/or pumped through. The treatment cavity has an inlet 30 through which the molten moldable material 3 can pass into and an outlet 31 through which it can exit the treatment cavity.  The treatment<br>
15 cavity geometry allows the shear strain and the shear strain rate imposed on the passing molten moldable material to vary controllably. At least one feeder 33 is for preparing the molten moldable material 3, the feeder including . a means for expelling the molten, moldable<br>
20 material through its outlet into the station treatment cavity inlet 30. In this embodiment at least one accumulator 34 is provided for collecting the treated molten, moldable material before it is sent to either a pelletizer system or to a pumping station or to a mold<br>

15 material contained within the treatment cavity is shown at 50 in FIG. 2A and 2B. With several stations connected to one another through gear pumps or screw pumps such as those at 11 in FIG. 3 or 26 in FIG. 7, the chain of treatment stations have a first station connected directly or through<br>
20 a gear pump and/or a static mixer (e.g. 52 in FIG. 7) to an extruder and a last station connected to a pelletizer line or a pumping station, or a mold cavity for immediate use of the disentangled melt.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, one<br>
25 surface in contact with the melt, which has a pattern of ribs as explained in FIG. 1A, is moved longitudinally with speed V, as shown for surface 7 in FIG. 2A, and the other surface is rotated/oscillated. The melt undergoes the effect of a combined (tensorial) periodic strain rate with<br>
30 its two components, in the longitudinal and rotational directions, adjusted to impose an optimized disentanglement effect. Yet, in another embodiment of the present invention,  the longitudinal motion of 7 ,occurs with<br><br>

modulated periodic speed in order to incorporate an oscillation component susceptible to facilitate the raise of the elasticity of the molten moldable material in the gap while the lateral rotation of 6,- with or without its 5 own oscillation, contributes, among other things, to the extensional fatigue in order to disentangle the melt according to US Patent 5,885,495.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the moving surface is not rotating but oscillating back and 10 forth with a certain amplitude a and frequency Ω Yet, in another embodiment of the present invention a combination of oscillation and constant rotation is. exerted on the moving surface (s). The value of the amplitude and frequency of vibration, the melt temperature, and the<br>
15   constant speed of rotation Ώ,   along with the number of<br>
ribs, are determined according to US Patent 5,885,495 in order to increase the amount of elasticity in the melt, and cause the melt to undergo extensional flow and fatigue, at given value of elasticity (shear-thinning) of the melt, two<br>
20 critical conditions for disentanglement to occur. Specifically, the number of ribs, the geometry of the ribs and their disposition with respect to melt flow direction, are designed not only to create specific acceleration and deceleration patterns in the cavity gap susceptible to<br>

wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow in the treatment cavity section is produced by feeding a molten moldable material 3 through a gap composed of at least one rotating and/or oscillating surface 10 presenting on its 5 contour a profile 12 over which the molten material flows and/or can be dragged and/or is being pushed through and/or pumped through, and a barrel 9 which can also be rotated/oscillated or can be stationary and which is heated/cooled through outside means ( not represented) . The<br>
10 surface profile (s) or rib means 12 consist of different patterns depending on the location of the treatment station along the extrusion axis and adapted to .the progressive change of the viscosity. FIG. 3 displays a few patterns possible such as small square/round bumps on the surface,<br>
15 or tilted and elongated ribs creating a split of the strain rate along the rotational and longitudinal axes, but many other designs, all referred to here as rib means, are conceivable, which a person skilled in the art will be able to adapt -after reading this disclosure.   The pumping<br>
20 station 11 is made of the few flights of a screw pump with given pitch and helix angle to pump the melt at given rate from one treatment station to the next by rotating the core surface 10. The apparatus described in FIG. 3 can be adapted to interface with the basic hardware of an extruder<br>
25 which already provides a barrel 9, heating and cooling means, and" a motor to produce the rotation of the moving surface 10, which would replace the screw of the extruder. In one embodiment of the present invention, the feeder which provides a liquid molten moldable material to the<br>
30 treatment cavity is itself another extruder or an extruder connected to a gear pump. For example, the molten moldable material is produced by the first extruder and is distributed through a breaker plate and a cross-head die<br><br>

to the inlet section of the second extruder, perpendicular to the first extruder, which attaches to the left end side of FIG. 3, and as illustrated in FIG. 7 by elements 23 and 24, The moving surface 10 is rotated by the second 5 extruder and its barrel 9 is stationary. The total length of the barrel is adjustable and is function of the numbers of stations required to achieve a certain level of viscosity reduction and the throughput desired.<br>
Yet, in another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
10 only one extruder is needed, but the screw, which is replaced by the treatment apparatus described in FIG. 3 in order to practice the present invention, is substantially extended in length to have a first section performing, like a normal screw with its own melting,  metering and<br>
15 pressurizing zones, followed by the disentanglement sections described in FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the treatment cavity of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein<br>
20 the shear vibration under extensional flow is created in the gap 3 of concentric conic surfaces 13 and 14 in relative motion with respect to one another, at least one of which presenting an array of ribs and bumps 12 and rotating at constant speed Ώ, and/or at modulated speed<br>
25    [Ώ + Σ αi*sin( ωi* t+θi)] and/or in a pure oscillation mode Σ<br>
αi*sin(ωi*t+θi),where αi,ωi,θi, are, respectively, the modulated amplitude, the frequency and the phase of the oscillation (the subindex "i" refers to the decomposition of the periodic motion into its Fourier"s components). As 30 explained before, the speed of rotation, the oscillation parameters, the pitch between the ribs, the shape and dimension of the ribs/bumps and grooves (between the ribs),<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/160M<br><br>
and the angle of tilt with respect to the cone axis of the ribs, are all inter-related and depend on the strain rate and acceleration required to produce disentanglement, as taught in .US Patent 5,885,495. 5 In FIG. -A, the gap height or wid"th can be increased or decreased by the relative axial or lateral translation of the concentric cones, which can be done through the implementation of linear bearings on the shaft in the direction of the straight double arrow.  In a particular<br>
10 and specific embodiment of the present invention, the gap width is automatically adjustable through an actuator and a controller opening or closing the gap, allowing an increase of the gap at intermittent intervals, to facilitate the extrusion of the treated molten moldable<br>
15   material out of the treatment cavity. The reason for such<br>
a feature can easily be understood: the disentanglement<br>
process requires a relatively narrow gap to implement the<br>
. conditions of strain and strain rate susceptible to<br>
disentangle the melt; but these conditions are not<br>
20 favorable to the throughput. By opening and closing the gap intermittently between a value which is favorable to the treatment and a value which is favorable to the throughput, a compromise can be found which optimizes the disentanglement process. The period between two successive<br>
25 openings of the gap can be programmed between 1 second and 10 minutes, without exclusion of other possible values. The variation of the gap width or height between its minimum and maximum value can be programmed between 5% and 200% of the treatment value.<br>
30 it is another object of the present invention to have a central computer controlling the value of all the parameters of the disentanglement process. Specifically, in FIG. 4, items 8 and 15 are shown to respectively<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>

represent. band heaters and cooling circuits to regulate precisely the temperature of the body of the surfaces in contact with the molten moldable material. Temperature probes (not shown) are inserted near the molten moldable 5 material to send electrical signals back to the central processing unit for activating the heating or cooling means in order to maintain the temperature in the gap constant. The operator can interface with a user friendly computer screen to enter all the parameters required to operate the<br>
10 disentanglement apparatus according to the present invention. For example, the operator enters the value of the temperature in the treatment cavity, the speed of rotation of the inner cone 14, the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation of the cone (which can be zero when<br>
15 there is only constant rotation and the rib means alone create the vibration effect) and the period and amplitude of the gap intermittent opening (whose variation can also be zero).<br>
FIG. ,5 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment<br>
20 of the treatment cavity of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow is created in the gap of a series of concentric cylindrical surfaces 13 and 14 of increasing larger diameter, in relative motion<br>
25 with respect to one another, at least one of which presenting an array of ribs and bumps and rotating at constant speed and/or at modulated speed and/or in a pure oscillation mode.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment<br>

variable gap arising from the relative separation of concentric surfaces in relative motion with respect to one another, at least one of which presenting specifically configured and disposed ribs and bumps 12 and rotating at 5 constant speed and/or at modulated speed and/or in a pure oscillation mode. As shown in Fig. 6, the shape of the ribs/bumps and their relative position is varied along the pathway of the molten moldable material in the treatment cavity depending on the amount of local melt pressure, the<br>
10   magnitude of the longitudinal drag strain rate desired and the speed and mode of rotation of the moving surface.<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the feeder 23 is an<br>
15   extruder  and/or a plunger,  and the disentanglement<br>
treatment occurs in a series of stations 24 connected<br>
through gear or screw pumps 26.  In each of the stations<br>
. 24, means 25 are provided to rotate and/or oscillate at<br>
least one, surface in contact with the molten moldable<br>
20 material passing through it in order to create flow conditions favorable to disentanglement, as described in US Patent 5,885,495 and in this disclosure. The temperature, the rotation speed, the oscillation amplitude and frequency are independently set for each station, but<br>
25   are  controlled from a central processing unit which overlooks "  all   aspects   of   this  multi-stations disentanglement process.    For practicing particular embodiments described earlier in this Patent application, stations 24 and the means 25 can be  provided for by<br>
30 traditional extruder drives, for which barrel and screw can be specifically adapted and modified to conform to disclosures specified in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 or 6. Mixing chambers can be added in 26, as well as in 25 means to<br><br>

modulate the gap dimension intermittently. At the end of the multi-stations, the disentangled melt is either pumped into an accumulator, not shown in FIG. 7, but described in this disclosure to prevent the melt to re-entangle, and 5 this accumulator is connected to a pelletizer line and/or to the feed of an extruder or injection molding equipment, or the exiting melt is directly sent into a cavity, such as a mold cavity of a hot runner system using a valve gate modified to encompass the present invention.<br>
10 FIG. 8 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the treatment cavity of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow on a molten moldable material 3 is created in the gap between<br>
15 cylindrical or conical rollers 27 in close contact to one another and a core surface at the center 28 with ribs, bumps or grooves 12 and which is either cylindrical or conical. FIG. 8 can be considered a cut through the system of cylinders which one could imagine vertical, with their<br>
20 axis perpendicular to the Figure, and the flow of molten moldable material occuring from the inlet at the top, along the axis of the cylinders or cones, towards the outlet at the bottom. More generally, at least one surface 27 or 28 is rotating at constant speed and/or at modulated speed<br>
25 and/or in a pure oscillation mode, as explained in several previous figures. For instance, both surfaces are turning at constant speed, respectively Ώ and Ώ . The rotation of rollers 27 can be from individual power, sources or through a common drive, shown as 29 in FIG. 8, which can be a belt<br>
30 or any other appropriate driving mechanism known to the art. At least one surface has a set of ribs/bumps 12 or grooves on it, shaped, disposed and configured to practice the invention, as already disclosed several times for the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
other figures. It is easy to conceive the presence of ribs/bumps or grooves on the core cylinder 28. Some are shown in FIG. 8. Rollers 27 are in close contact but do not touch each other directly, so they can turn in the same 5 direction (counterclockwise in FIG. 8) .  In one embodiment of the present invention, the distance which separates them is very small, of the order of 0.03 to 0.05mm in order to prevent the molten moldable material 3 to come through their separation. A set of spring loaded ball bearings can<br>
10 be used to keep the rolling cylinders at very close proximity while rotating in the same direction through means 29 In another embodiment of the present invention, rollers 27 can have ribs and bumps disposed on their surface so that they intermesh in the region of closest<br>
15 proximity. An example of this embodiment is shown at the bottom of FIG. 14. Starting at a certain speed of rotation<br>
Ώ c, the layers of molten moldable material in contact with 27 have enough elasticity built up from the speed of rotation-of rollers 27 to "stretch over", i.e. ignore the<br>
20 contours of the gap formed where the rollers intermesh or come into close contact, and create an homogeneous round circularly rotating layer which encapsulates and drives in its rotation the rest of the molten moldable material enclosed in the gap between the rollers 27 and roller 28.<br>
25 The stretch-over moving wall, created by cooperative motion across the rotating rollers, can be used, in one preferred embodiment of the present invention, to minimize or avoid slippage at the wall while practicing the disentanglement process through rotation/oscillation of 28.  Furthermore,<br>
30 this embodiment allows far greater speed of extrusion through the treatment cavity than is normally available at low pressure drop, because wall slippage is known to prevent fast extrusion throughput. Finally, depending on<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCTYUSOO/16086<br><br>
the speed of rotation of 28, processing the molten moldable material under conditions where a stretch-over layer is created can present positive advantages on the kinetics of disentanglement. 5 FIG. 9 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the treatment cavity of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow is created by the relative motion in the molten moldable material 17 of<br>
10 a train of oblong members or ovally-shaped wagons 16 circulating, at constant speed or at a modulated speed, in a torus ring in communication with an inlet 21 and an oulet 22 conduits. The motion of 16 is driven by a cylinder 19 through links 18-  Cylinder 19 is driven by an actuator<br>
15 connected to a motor. Links 18 are a spider ring connecting rigidly 19 and 16, and letting the flow pass through without resistance or interference. The torus is jacketed by a thermal fluid and/or band heaters and water passages, allow control of the temperature inside the ring.<br>
20 As motion of 16 in the molten moldable material 17 is driven by 19, the gap at any specific location of the ring periodically increases and decreases as the ovally shaped wagons pass through it, and thus periodic shear strain conditions are created with intensive extensional flow<br>
25 around the wagons  When the conditions of strain rate and strain rate variation (acceleration/deceleration) are set to practice .disentanglement in the molten moldable material according to US patent 5,885,495, the treated melt is being pushed ahead towards the outlet hole 22 communicating with<br>
30 the inlet 21 of the next torus ring one station down. An assembly of torus rings 67 piling up on top of one another and communicating through their respective inlet and outlet holes is shown in FIG. 10.<br><br>

FIG. 10 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the feeder is an extruder and/or a plunger feeding molten moldable material 5   in 21 of the. first torus ring,  the disentanglement treatment occurs in each of a series of superposed and interconnected ring stations 17 defined by a tubular track through which a train of ovally-shaped wagons 16 circulate at controlled speed, driven by a common core cylinder 19, 10   attached to the wagons. The molten moldable material is treated according to the present invention, as described in FIG. 9, and exits a ring station in 22 which directly connects with the inlet of the ring station located under it. At each station, the temperature is adapted to account 15   for the change in viscosity produced by disentanglement. At the bottom of the column in FIG. 10, the outlet of the last ring is connected to an accumulator 20 which is itself connected to a pelletizer line and/or the feed of an extruder or injection molding equipment (not shown). 20       FIG. 11 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the power transmission of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the shear vibration and the controlled extensional fatigue of the molten moldable material in the treatment cavity are 25   applied on both axes 310 and 320 of an epicyclycloidal differential. An epicyclic differential is composed of 3 principle elements: (a) the case planet carrier 310; (b) the torque arm sleeve sun gear 320; and c) the central bore sun gear 330. These 3 elements are mechanically connected 30   by the sun and planet gears which make up the epicyclic differential gear train.<br>

invention, goes into 330. The Willis formula establishes the relationship between the rotational speeds of the 3 elements 310, 320 and 330, allowing to combine at 330 the motions which are imposed, independently, at 310 and 320:<br>
5	N3 = pN2 + Na / K<br>
where Nl is the rotational speed of the case 310, N2 is the instantaneous rotational speed of the torque arm sleeve motion 320, and N3 is the rotational speed found for the motion of the central bore 330.  p is the internal ratio<br>
10 between the torque arm sleeve 320 and the central bore 330, i.e. when there is no rotation on the 310 axis (the case is maintained fixed). Likewise, K in Willis equation is the reduction ratio between the case 310 and the central bore 330, i.e. when there is no rotary oscillation on N2.<br>
15 Thus a differential also operates as a gear box with reduction ratio K.<br>
Specifically, a rotary vibration motion can be set at 320 and a pure rotation with given controllable speed of rotation at 310. The motions on axes 310 and 320 are<br>
20 totally independent and can be programmed separately. The combination of motions 310 and 320 arises naturally at 330 with no or minimum backlash. According to one embodiment of the present invention, an epicyclic differential can replace the gear box which connects the motor of an<br>
25 extruder and the shaft driving the screw. This replacement allows to simultaneously rotate and oscillate such a shaft as disclosed in FIGS. 3 or 4 which is introduced in the barrel, provided the other axis of the epicyclic differential is driven by a rotary vibrating device. This<br>
30 device can also be used to drive the screw of an injection molding machine, combining rotation and oscillation of the<br><br>

screw, a combination which produces easier flow through extensive shear-thinning.<br>
FIG. 12 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the shear vibration transmission of the disentanglement 5 apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the shear vibration in the molten moldable material in the treatment cavity is created by the oscillation of the inner cone of a concentric conical assembly 114 attached to one axis of an epicyclycloidal differential,<br>
10   the rotary oscillation being created through a cam 110 and a piston 112. In this embodiment, the treatment cavity is a pair of concentric cones, such as disclosed in Figure 4, with a constant gap clearance 114 where the molten moldable material (which fills 114) is sheared and oscillated back<br>
15 and forth through handle 110 activated by a piston 112. Frame 116 includes the heating/cooling jacket filled with thermal fluid and the thermocouple to control the temperature. The clearance gap between the two cones can be adjusted at the beginning of the operation between 0.5mm<br>
20 and 5mm. Once adjusted it remains constant throughout the treatment. The piston arm can be attached to the handle 110 at different level positions 113, which allows to modify the amplitude of the shear rotational vibration along with the torque available. The piston displacement<br>
25 can also be varied, which allows another degree of freedom to modify  the amplitude of rotation of the . rotary oscillation. The molten moldable material is entered in the apparatus through an extruder and gear pump shown as 111, and is pulled out of the cone assembly through another<br>
30 gear pump 115. In this particular embodiment/ the gear pump at the outlet recirculates the throughput back to inlet 111 by a separate connection, allowing several passes before the melt is pumped out of the disentanglement<br><br>

apparatus.  In this embodiment, the disentangled melt is produced intermittently but in a continuous way.   The extruder inlet valve and the outlet valve 117 to the pelletizer unit are both closed while the several passes 5   of molten material through the treatment cavity occur in close circle. When a desired viscosity reduction has been achieved, after several passes, the extruder is signaled to let in a new batch of untreated molten moldable material in the treatment cavity.  The gap clearance can be opened 10   wider during this purge to prevent the disentangled melt to be pressurized. The outlet valve 117 to the pelletizer line is kept open and the recirculation-outlet valve (not shown) is kept closed during the purge of the treatment cavity. Conversely, those valves are respectively closed 15   and open during the multi-passes treatment.<br>
FIG. 13 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the treatment cavity of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the shear vibration under extensional flow in the molten 20   moldable material is created by the relative motion of two concentric conic surfaces at constant speed or at a modulated speed, i.e. combined constant and vibrated speed, or under pure rotary oscillation while the molten moldable material is pushed and/or dragged and/or pumped from the 25   inlet conduit 220 to the outlet conduit 270 of the treatment cavity (FIG. 13) . In this embodiment, unlike for the embodiment disclosed in FIG. 12 which applies to an intermittent release of treated molten material, the treatment cavity and its attachments clearly define a 30   station, such as item 24 in FIG. 7,. suitable for a continuous disentanglement process.  It is clear in FIG. 13 that flanges 220 and 270 are identical, allowing a reDeat to other stations of what can be considered standard<br><br>

features in the description of this station. Molten moldable material 2S0 enters the treatment station through inlet 220, goes through a spider and fills the cavity created by two concentric cones defining a gap. Inlet 220 5 can be connected to a gear or screw pump.  For the first station, as disclosed in FIG. 7, an extruder is used ahead of the gear pump to prepare the molten moldable material and pressurize it to a given value. The inside cone is continued beyond the treatment section 260 to become 280,<br>
10 which is connected to the epicyclic differential with its two independent motion axis, as described in Figure 11. The molten moldable material 250 is flowing from the inlet 220 to the outlet 270 due to the combination of pressure flow, and the rotation of the inside cone and the presence<br>
15 of tilted ribs on the surface of the inside and outside cones, as explained in FIGS. 4 or 6. While the molten moldable material 250 passes through the gap created by the cones, it disentangles due to the combined action of the rotation and/or oscillation of the inside cone 260 through<br>
20 the shaft 280. The temperature and pressure of the molten moldable material is measured at several places 210 along the pathway from 220 to 270. Band heaters 230 are wrapped around the frame and water passages 240 and 242 are made to cool 250 from both the outside (240) and the inside<br>
25 (242) in order to maintain its temperature precisely controlled. The outlet 270 can be connected to a gear or screw pump. In the case of a gear pump, the rotation speed of the pump is controlled to build the melt pressure back to the value required for the next treatment station. FIG.<br>

FIGS. 14A and 14B are schematic illustrations of one embodiment of the disentanglement apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein one or several feeders 420 feed molten moldable material to a 5 series of tubular cavities 450, intermeshing or not, which themselves connect, directly (FIG. 14B) or through pumping sections 400, to other series of tubular cavities, until the last array of treatment stations, which connect to a collector 410 and a pellitizer line and/or the feed of an<br>
10 extruder or injection molding equipment (not shown). The surfaces of the tubular cavities are covered with ribs/ bumps and/or grooves 450, designed to synthesize the proper strain rate profile to achieve disentanglement and to drag the molten moldable material forward to the next tubular<br>
15 station and along the axis of the tubular cavities. At least one surface 430 is moving in order to shear the melt under vibration and accomplish the extensional fatigue which are the two requirements to produce disentanglement efficiently. This can be exerted through the rotation of<br>
20   rotor 430 at given rotation speed, or by rotary vibration of rotor 430 at given frequency and amplitude, or by combination of the two previous motions. At the FIG. 14B, the two tubular cavities are positioned to intermesh in their center, along their axis, which is an embodiment<br>
25 useful to apply in the accumulator at the final outlet before the pelletizer line to prevent recovery of the disentanglement.<br>
FIGS. 15A to 15C are schematic illustrations of one embodiment of the treatment cavity of the disentanglement<br>
30 apparatus designed in accordance with the present invention wherein the ribs/bumps on at least one of the surfaces in contact with the molten moldable material have a specific shape to create a given profile of strain rate and strain<br><br>

rate variation under extension, and are aligned in a specific manner with respect to the axis of surface rotation in order to create a certain  amount of drag flow. FIGS. 15A to 15C define some of the shape parameters and 5 the angle of tilt.  The contours of the ribs are calculated to eliminate any possibility of turbulence or other non linear defect in the flow, which should remain laminar. The height of the rib, e, the radius Rl, R2 and R3 which define the curvature to accelerate (Rl) or decelerate (R3) the<br>
10 flow, can be different along cross sections aa and bb (the cross section bb is not shown here) . The strain rate vector decomposes into two components, which defines two directions of drag flow. The shape of the ribs along each axis aa or bb is determined by the strain rate profile<br>
15 desired in these directions. Both profiles can be used to define conditions of shear vibration and/or extensional fatigue which can couple up to optimize shear-thinning and disentanglement effects.<br>
According to another object of this invention the<br>
20 temperature controls of the molding apparatus are varied to enable cooling of the melt at a given rate until a given temperature is reached, while simultaneously adjusting the frequency of shear oscillation as a function of melt temperature in order to maintain a specific state of<br>
25 elasticity of the melt which favors disentanglement efficiency. According to another technique of the invention, the melt temperature is controlled to change between two temperature values by alternately cooling and heating the melt while disentanglement or simply shear<br>

efficiency.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the melt temperature in each of the treatment stations is made to vary along the pathway of the extrudate passing through it, 5 by gradually varying the velocity of a thermal cooling fluid flowing in the coolant runners embedded in the barrel walls, to produce a cooling effect with determined rate from the inlet of the station to the outlet, provided the coolest temperature is greater than the Tc whose value is 10   determined by the given cooling rate.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, cooling fluids are circulating"within runners located in short sections of the treatment station, each section with its own fluid velocity controlled by the amount of opening/closing of a needle 15   gate located at the inlet or outlet of the cooling section. In another embodiment of the present invention, cooling effect within a treatment station can be realized by increasing or decreasing the cross-section area of the runners and/or changing their location with respect to the 20   moving melt  under  treatment  and/or by  interposing materials,  heat sinks or gaps of different thermal conductivity (for instance air gaps) between the cooling medium and the melt passageway.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment of the present 25 invention, the temperature of the thermal fluid passing through the embedded runners varies, for instance by controlled mixing of two fluids at two different temperatures, or the endlessly repeated sequence of the successive passage of two fluids maintained at different 30   temperatures.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the melt temperature in the treatment station is locally varied by means of dielectric heaters and/or microwave heaters in<br><br>

employed when practicing this invention. Those skilled in<br>
the art will be able to select the temperature controlling<br>
.5   means which best suit their "needs after reading this<br>
specification.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus which produce shear oscillation under extension of the melt is constantly adjusted as a function of the<br>
10 temperature of the melt, while the disentanglement treatment takes place in the station, in order to keep the relative elasticity, (G"/G*) equal to a predetermined value. Any suitable controlling means of the oscillation frequency and amplitude as a function of temperature can<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention the means that produce the continuous drag at constant speed of the melt by relative motion of the surfaces confining the melt are constantly adjusted as a function of the<br>

FIG. 16 demonstrates the effect of cooling rate on the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
value of the onset of crystallization temperature, Tc for a semi-crystalline polymer melt. The slowly cooled melt, cooled at approximately 10°C/min, starts to crystallize at 240°C. This corresponds to the sharp drop of the specific 5 volume in the bottom  trace of FIG. 16, associated with the formation of a more dense phase, the crystallites. FIG. 17 shows that the melt elasticity of the amorphous state is disrupted and interfered with by the presence of the crystallites which act as cross-linking tie points between<br>
10 the macromolecules. The sharp increase of the relative elasticity is not due to an increased cooperative interaction between the macromolecules, which is a criterion to induce disentanglement, but rather to the increase of the tie points.<br>
15 The upper trace in FIG. 16 corresponds to a melt cooled at approximately 200°C/min. The onset of crystallization is now at Tc = 180°C, which is 60°C below the temperature of crystallization for the slowly cooled melt.<br>
20 As a consequence of the effect of cooling rate on the value of Tc, the amorphous nature of the melt is preserved to lower temperatures, here an extra 60°C. Temperature is decreasing as one submits the melt to a fast cooling rate, and,  eventually,  it  reaches  the  new  Tc  where<br>
25 crystallization takes place. For instance, it takes 18 seconds to cool from 240°C to 180°C at 200°C/min. If we control temperature in such a way that it starts to raise just before it reaches the new Tc, then the melt does not crystallize and remains amorphous over an extended 60°C,<br>
30 which can be made available for disentanglement purpose by increasing its elasticity through shear oscillation under extensional fatigue. For instance, if one chooses to disentangle the amorphous melt when its relative elasticity<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086 <br>
(G"/G*) =0.83, FIG. 17 shows that for a frequency of 10 rad/s, it is not possible to reach that elasticity level without the interference of an intense crystallization which takes place starting at Tc = 242°C. The value of 5 (G"/G*) is only equal to 0.3 at the . onset of crystallization, for this frequency. This value can be raised by using higher frequency of shear oscillation. Using the time-temperature superposition principle which applies to the rheological behavior of viscoelastic melts,<br>
10 one can calculate the frequency which should be applied to raise the elasticity of the melt at T = 242°C from (G"/G*) = 0.3 to (G"/G*) - 0.83. The suggested frequency is 5,382 rad/s (857 Hz) . While achieving such frequency of oscillation  is  certainly  doable,  it  would  not  be<br>
15 economically practical and/or would cause serious problems of noise in a production environment. A preferred solution is precisely the purpose of the present invention. If the temperature could be lowered to 220°C, which is below the Tc at slow, cooling rate {and therefore not doable without<br>
20 the means of the present invention), but above the Tc of the fast cooling rate, the frequency of oscillation to raise (G"/G*) to the proper disentanglement range becomes 166 rad/s (27 Hz), which is within the practical range of acceptable industrial solutions, for economic reasons.<br>
25 Reducing temperature further down to 200°C would lower oscillation frequency even lower, in order to maintain the same value for (G"/G*).<br>
According to the present invention, as applied to Nylon 66 for example, the melt temperature is decreased<br>
30 during the disentanglement treatment in such a way as to lower Tc by e.g. 60°C, by the effect of a fast cooling rate on Tc, and subsequently increased to avoid cooling past 180°C, which is the Tc of the fastly. cooled melt, until<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br><br>
another temperature is reached, at which stage the cooling cycle starts over again.  More specifically, the upper temperature can be T = 245°C, and the lower temperature 185°C. The cycle time to reverse the change of temperature 5.   is 18 seconds. This can be achieved in many different ways by those skilled in the art, who will be able to select the temperature controlling means which best suit their needs. One advantageous and economical means consists in alternatively pumping at fast flow rate a thermal fluid 10   accumulated in isothermally maintained tanks at two temperatures, one temperature higher by approximatively 15°C than the upper temperature of the cycle range, the other lower by also 15°C than the lower temperature of the range. The individual fluids are only pumped for a portion 15   of  the cycle time to allow for inertia effect to take place at the switch of pumping fluids. The temperature of the fluids in the tank can be adjusted, along with the proportional timing for alternating the pumping of the two fluids, in order to achieve the correct temperature profile 20   which fits the disentanglement treatment.  Those skilled in the art would know how to design and control such a system, built with temperature controllers, thermocouples, heating and cooling means, and a servo-controlled switching valve, all in a servo-loop conveniently programmable from 25   a master computer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the temperature is profiled along the pathway of the flowing melt by controlling the flow rate of the cooling thermal fluid circulating in the coolant runners or the cooling 30 jackets inside the die and/or barrel of the treatment cavity. For example, the coolant thermal fluid can circulate, from the exit end of the treatment station towards the inlet,  in a spirally shaped runner of<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/USOO/16086<br><br>
decreasing cross-section, located further away from the melt cavity as it gets closer to the inlet end of the station, resulting in a gradient of cooling capacity along the melt flow axis. Other means known to those in the art 5 of mold temperature control, such as band heaters, heat pipes, heat sinks, air gaps etc, can be used to create the correct temperature difference between the inlet and the outlet of the treatment station to generate the desired cooling rate profile as the melt passes through. The same 10 temperature profile can be repeated from station to station, maintaining the melt in an amorphous state as disentanglement proceeds.<br>
For a given temperature, elasticity increases with<br>
frequency. For a given frequency, elasticity increases as<br>
15   temperature decreases.  In order to control precisely the<br>
amount of elasticity of the melt at each temperature, a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention is to adjust<br>
the value of the frequency of shear oscillation to optimize<br>
disentanglement at each melt temperature. Accordingly, in<br>
20   a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the number<br>
of ribs, bumps or grooves per turn on the rotating surfaces<br>
of the treatment station varies with the temperature of the<br>
melt at that location. The density of rib means decreases<br>
as temperature decreases, and conversely, increases as<br>
25   temperature increases along the pathway.<br>
When the disentanglement system is made up of a series of small sections which can be independently controlled mechanically and thermally, each section temperature can be coupled with the optimum disentanglement variables at 30 that temperature: the best oscillation frequency, the best rotation speed, and the best strain amplitude for the extensional fatigue. The temperature profile is determined by the temperature difference between adjacent sections.<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
When the temperature of the thermal fluid is cycled in time, the frequency of oscillation is synchronized to vary according to a program to maintain the desired elasticity profile that optimizes disentanglement at all 5 times. For most practical applications, frequency can be varied between 1 and 100 Hz.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates an embodiment of the invention 500 that includes a pair of polymer melt treatment chambers or annular (cylindrical or conical or both) gaps 506 and 510, 10   defined between the inner and out surfaces of a continously rotatable (Ώ) and/or rotatably oscillatable (ω, α) rotor or cylinder 508, and the outer surface of inner fixes cylinder or cone 504, and the inner surface of outer fixed cylinder or cone 512.  The surfaces of rotor 50 6 are 15   provided with the rib means of the present invention and/or the surfaces of fixed members 504 and 512 that bound gaps 506 and 510 have the rib means thereon, as long as there are at least one set of rib means in each chamber. A fixed shaft or.support 502 carries the fixed member 504. 20       Examples of possible diameters for the surfaces in the embodiment of FIG. 18 are: outside of 502 is 7.62cm; outside of 504 is 15.24cm; inside of 508 is 15.88cm; outside of 508 is 23.50cm; inside of 512 24.36cm; and outside of 512 is 32.98cm.  The gaps 506 and 510 are 25   typically 1.6mm to 6mm but can be thicker or thinner depending on the type of melt and the element diameters. This is for minimum through-put of 65 kg/hour for polycarbonate.<br>
FIG. 19 illustrated an embodiment of the invention<br>
30   that has a rotor, stem, screw, tube or shaft 602 for<br>
bounding the inside of a melt treatment gap and rotatable<br>
and or oscillatable about its axis.  Rib means 604 in the<br>
surface of rotor 602 are in the form of honeycomb rib<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086 <br>
means. Although hexagonal cells of the honeycomb means 604 are illustrated, other polygonal shapes can be used. Each cell has a pair or side wall 606 that extend at an angle 6 to the flow direction F which is also parallel to the 5 rotor axis. Each cell also has upstream and downstream transverse walls 612, 608, and upstream and downstream angles walls 614, 610. The transverse walls extend at an oblique angle to the flow direction F while the angles walls extend at an acute angle. These walls also intersect<br>
10 the upstream and downstream ends of the next side wall 606 in the honeycomb means. This arrangement has been found by the inventor to be very useful in that it causes the repeated and periodic dividing of the melt as in pass each intersection as the rotor rotates, thus advancing the local<br>
15 acceleration/ deceleration of the melt at each intersection and creating the viscosity reducing effect. Typical wall thicknesses for the walls of the honeycomb means is from about 0.15mm to about 1.0mm, depending on the diameter D of the rotor 602 and the rotation speed (continuous and/or<br>
20 oscillating), frequency and amplitude, and melt type. Wall height is typically about 0.1mm to 1.0mm. The distance d between side walls 606 also depends rotor diameter, speed and melt type. Distance d is typically about 1.5 to 5.0mm. The angle θ may be 2 to 85° or preferably about 30 to 60°.<br>
25 The embodiment of FIGS. 20 and 21 comprises a rotor, stem, screw, tube or shaft 702 for bounding the inside of a melt treatment gap and rotatable and or oscillatable about its axis. Rib means 704 in the surface of rotor 702 are in the form of rail means that are reminiscent of rail<br>
30 road tracks. Rail means 704 are formed of pairs of parallel rail walls 708 spaced by distance 1 (about 0.1 to about 1.2mm) that is comparable to the distance d for the honeycomb means of FIG. 19, and extending at angle θ to the<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/I6086<br><br><br>
flow direction F as was the case in the FIG. 19 embodiment. A plurality of cross or tie walls 708 extend between the rail walls. The wall height hr of rail walls 706 is about 0.5 to 1.5mm, and the width wr is about 0.4 to 1.2mm. The 5 bases of the cross walls 708 are space by wb from each other by about 0.5 to a few centimeters depending on the strain rate acceleration requirements, along the rail walls and are shorter that the rail walls 706, with a height e of about 0.1 to 1.5mm. The top width wt of each cross wall 10 is about 0.1 to 1.5mm. The sides of the cross walls 708 are inclined at an angle 5 to the surface of rotor 702 by about 25 to 89°.<br>
FIG. 22 is an embodiment of the invention which is applied to a valve gate in the hot runner system of an 15   injection molding machine.  The valve gate has a gate portion 802 with a passage 804 for receiving a polymer melt, and a stem or rod 808 having a valve face or end 818 that  can be moved  axially by  known  drive  means schematically shown by arrow 812.  To open and close the 20   passage and admit or stop the flow of melt into a valve gate busing 806, the stem 808 is moved in the direction of arrow 812. As with the other embodiments of the invention, stem 808 and/or the inner surface of bushing 806, carry rib means 810 and is continuously and/or oscillatingly rotated 25    (Ώ; co, a) about its axis.  This produces a significant reduction in the viscosity and injection pressure of the melt. The viscosity is reduced with or without an increase in temperature, resulting in a shorted cycle time.<br>
The rotation of the stem and even axial movement can<br>
30   be imparted to the stem 808 to advance the melt in bushing<br>
806.  The continuous rotational speed of stem 808 is a<br>
function of the diameter of the stem (for example about 6mm<br>
to 15mm) and is mush higher (about 300 to 1700 rpm) than<br><br>
WO 00/76735<br><br>
PCT/US00/16086<br><br>
for extrusion machines which use much larger diameter<br>
tubes( 1 to 125 rpm) .<br>
Similar arrangements are possible for the extruder<br>
section, the injection section and various other possible 5   parts of known equipment for processing polymer melts.<br>
The complex rib means of the invention can be made<br>
using: electro-forming; electro-etching; laser soldering;<br>
laser  forming;  electro-discharge  machining   (EDM);<br>
investment casting or mechanical machining, to name a few. 10   Suitable materials for the rotor and barrel are stainless<br>
steel, 4140 steel, high Rockwell bronze and the like. For<br>
the rotors the outer surface of a rod, e.g.. 9mm in diameter<br>
and 23cm long can be formed with the rib means.  For the<br>
barrel, an 18mm diameter tube, for example, can be cut 15   along a plane parallel to the tube axis, the inner surfaces<br>
formed with the rib means and the semicylindrical or<br>
semiconical halves welded back together.<br>
As general considerations,  the shape,  geometry,<br>
dimensions, and spacing of the ribs, bumps and/or grooves 20   of the rib means are selected and tailored depending on the<br>
type of polymer melt to be processed, following the<br>
criterion of my US Patent 5,885,495.   These design<br>
criterion can be optimized for the specific melt, with the<br>
rheological parameters as taught by this patent "especially 25   with regard to G"/G*, frequency and amplitude of strain<br>
created by the squeezing and relaxing of the melt by the<br>
rib means.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been<br>
shown and described in detail to illustrate the application 30   of the principles of the invention, it will be understood<br>
that the invention may be embodied otherwise without<br>
departing from such principles.<br><br>
