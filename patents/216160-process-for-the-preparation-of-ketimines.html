				<td>Process for the preparation of ketimines<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ketimines, which are suitable as starting materials for the preparation of pharmaceutical active compounds having antidepressant properties, for example sertraline.<br>
Processes for the preparation of ketimines are described, for example, in US-A-4,536,518 or US-A-4,855,500.<br>
The process for the preparation of ketimines disclosed in US-A-4,536,518 (columns 9/10, Example 1 (F)) is characterized in that the ketone is reacted with methylamine with cooling in the presence of titanium tetrachloride in an aprotic solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran. This process has the disadvantage that it has to be carried out using titanium tetrachloride, which is ecologically hazardous. The process procedure is additionally expensive, because the reaction is carried out with cooling. A further disadvantage of this process relates to the work-up. The product must be precipitated using additional hexane.<br>
The process for the preparation of ketimines disclosed in US-A-4,855,500 (columns 5/6, claim 1) comprises reacting the ketone with anhydrous methylamine with cooling in an aprotic solvent, such as, for example, methylene chloride, toluene or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a molecular sieve.<br>
This process has the disadvantage that the molecular sieve employed is expensive and has to be recycled again in an additional step. A further disadvantage of this process is that the molecular sieve has to be separated off and the product precipitated using additional hexane.<br>

The solvents employed according to the invention can be used as individual compounds or as mixtures of two or more individual compounds of identical or different solvent groups a) - (I).<br>
In addition, there is the possibility of adding further solubilizing or solubility-inhibiting additives (e.g. toluene or cyclohexane).<br>
If the preparation of the compound of the formula (1) is carried out with methylamine in the presence of a Ci-C24amine or CrCi2nitrile as solvent (with or without catalyst), the conditions and preferences indicated above for the solvent (a) apply for the Ci-C24amines and those indicated above for the solvent (b) apply for the Ci-Ci2nitriles. The use of solvents (b) is preferred here.<br>
Generally, the use of solvents (a) or (b), in particular (b), is preferred.<br><br>
Suitable sulfonic acid catalysts are, for example, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or camphor-10-sulfonic acid.<br>
A process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (1) is especially preferred in which a sulfonic acid catalyst is used, in particular p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or camphor-10-suifonic acid.<br>
The molar quantitative ratio of the catalyst employed to the methylamine employed is expediently 0.001:1 to 1:1, in particular 0.01:1 to 0.5:1, e.g. 0.05:1 to 0.1:1.<br>
The 1:1 molar quantitative ratio of the catalyst to the methylamine also means that the methylamine can also be employed in the process according to the invention in the form of a salt, for example of methylamine hydrochloride.<br>
The process according to the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature from 20 to 120, in particular 30 to 100X, if appropriate under slight pressure, and the isolation at a temperature from -20 to 40, in particular 0 to 30Â°C.<br>
For the preparation of the compound of the formula (1) in the presence of a catalyst, a temperature range from 30 to 80Â°C, in particular 30 to 70Â°C and preferably 30 to 60Â°C, is preferred.<br>
For the preparation of the compound of the formula (1) without the presence of a catalyst, a temperature range from 50 to 120Â°C, in particular 70 to 120Â°C and preferably 80 to 120""C, is preferred. The upper value of the temperature range preferred here is IIO"C, in particular 100Â°C.<br>
The proportion of sertralone in the reaction mixture is, for example, in the range from 5 to 70, preferably 30 to 60, % by weight.<br>
The reaction is particularly preferably carried out using a large molar excess of methylamine.<br>
A process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (1) is therefore particularly preferred in which the molar quantitative ratio of the compound of the formula (2) to methylamine is 1:1 to 1:1000, in particular 1:1.05 to 1:50, e.g. 1:1.5 to 1:15.<br>
The methylamine can be employed in the form of methylamine gas or as a solution in a nonÂ¬alcoholic solvent.<br>
A process variant is of very particular interest in which the reaction can be carried out in pure methylamine, in particular under pressure, this compound being employed simultaneously as<br><br>
a solvent and reagent. In this case, customarily no significant amounts of further solvent are employed.<br>
Also of particular interest is a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (1) in which the compound of the formula (1) is continuously crystallized from the reaction medium during the preparation and then filtered off.<br>
Also of especial interest is a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (1), in which the filtrate is employed for a further reaction for the preparation of compounds of the formula (1). In this case, the amounts of the compound of the formula (2) and methylamine used are replenished. 2 to 10 recyclings of the filtrate are preferred.<br>
The present process according to the invention is accordingly also suitable as a continuous process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (1).<br>
The water formed during the process can be bound, if desired, using an additional chemical water-binding agent for example an orthoester, e.g. trimethyl orthoformate.<br>
After reaction is complete, if desired, the compound of the formula (1) obtained can be subjected to purification by recrystallization.<br>
Preferably, for this purification process a solvent is employed which is selected from<br>
(a)	Ci-C24amines,<br>

in which<br>
b       is 1, 2, 3 or 4, and<br>

X      is Ca-CealkanetriyI or N(CH2CH2)3, or<br>
if b is 4,<br>
X      is C4-C8alkanetetrayl.<br>

R22 and R23 independently of one another are branched or unbranched Ci-Ci2alkyl; Cs-CTcycloalkyl; C2-Ci2alkenyl; C3-Ci2alkynyl; phenyl or phenyl-d-Caalkyl, which is not substituted or is substituted by one or more Ci-CsalkyI groups; A1 is a direct bond; or C1C5alkylene; and n is 0 or 1.<br>
Exemplary representatives of this group are, for example, aliphatlcally saturated ketones, such as, for example, propanone (acetone), butanone (methyl ethyl ketone) or 2-pentanone (methyl propyl ketone); cycloaliphatically saturated ketones, for example cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or cycloheptanone (suberone); aliphatlcally unsaturated ketones, for example 3-buten-2-one, 1,4-pentadien-3-one, 3-pentyn-2-one; aromatic ketones, for example benzophenone; aromatic/aliphatic ketones, for example methyl phenyl ketone (acetophenone) or propiophenone; diketones, for example 2,3-butanedione, 2,4-pentanedione or 2,5-hexanedione; or aromatic diketones, for example diphenylethanedione (benzil).<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the purification is carried out in the same solvent as the reaction.<br>
In a preferred process variant, the purification is carried out by recrystallization of sertraline (compound of the formula (1)) under reflux. For this, the isomerically pure sertraline is introduced in a suitable solvent into a suitable reaction vessel having a stirrer and reflux condenser. The reaction mass is heated to reflux temperature in an inert gas atmosphere with stirring until a clear solution is present. The solution is cooled to the appropriate isolation temperature, the product slowly crystallizing. The suspension is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with the solvent and dried. The imine yield is from 80 to 99%, with a sertralone<br><br>
content of 0.1 to 5.0% (HPLC), a catalyst contamination of 
In a further process variant, the recrystallization of sertraline is carried out under pressure. For this, the crude sertraline and the solvent are introduced into a suitable pressure reactor having a stirrer. The reactor is sealed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The stirrer is started and the reaction mixture is heated to the desired reaction temperature until a clear solution is present. The solution is cooled to the appropriate isolation temperature, the product slowly precipitating. The suspension is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with the solvent and dried.<br>
The solution temperatures in the selected solvents are in the range from 30 to 150, preferably 70 to 120 ,Â°C.<br>
According to the boiling points of the solvents indicated, the purification process can be carried out at normal pressure under reflux or at elevated pressure, normally in the range from 0 to 10, preferably from 0 to 3, bar.<br>
The cooling gradients are in the range from 0.05 to 10, preferably 0.1 to 1, "C/min.<br>
The isolation temperatures are in the range from -20 to 40, preferably 0 to 25, Â°C.<br>
The concentrations of crude sertraline in the clear solution are in the range from 5 to 40, preferably 15 to 20, % by weight.<br>
During the process, adsorbents, for example active carbon or adsorber resins, can be added for the removal of colouring impurities. These adsorbents are added to the clear solution in amounts from 1 to 10% and removed hot by filtration before the crystallization process.<br>
By means of the purification step, both the product purity can be improved and impurities interfering in the further reaction, for example water or catalyst residues, can be separated off.<br>
In a very particularly preferred embodiment, the reaction according to claim 1 is carried out in the presence of a sulfonic acid catalyst and the compound of the formula (1) obtained is subjected to a purification step.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of optically pure (cis)-and/or (trans)-sertraline or enantiomerically enriched mixtures of (cis)- and {trans)-sertraline. The process is characterized by the following reaction steps (l)-(lll):<br><br>
Example 2 : Preparation of sertraline in amines with acid catalysis at 50Â°C<br>
10 g of pure sertralone (&gt; 99%) and 23 g of amine are introduced into a suitable reaction<br>
vessel having a stirrer and gas inlet. The stirrer is started, the suspension is cooled to 0Â°C<br>
and 3 g of methylamine are passed in. After addition of 0.65 g (0.1 eq) of para-toluene-<br>
sulfonic acid (catalyst), the reaction mass is heated to 50Â°C, stirred until the reaction stops<br>
and then cooled to 10Â°C. The suspension is filtered, washed with cold ethanol and dried in<br>
