MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSION USING VARIABLE GAIN AMPLIFICATION BASED ON DATA IMPORTANCE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to multimedia transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	Multimedia such as video and audio can be transmitted over a number of paths,<br>
including cable, the Internet, and broadcast. For instance, satellite or terrestrial broadcast stations can be used to transmit multimedia to mobile computing devices such as mobile telephones.<br>
[0003]	Typically,  multimedia  data  is  voluminous,  which  means  that  significant<br>
transmission path bandwidth, unfortunately a finite resource, must be used. This is particularly the case for high fidelity multimedia, e.g., high resolution video. That is, the higher the quality of service being provided, the more bandwidth must be used.<br>
[0004]	As recognized by the present invention, some portions of a multimedia stream are<br>
more important than other portions. For example, a digitized, uncompressed video stream can be represented by a sequence of pixels. Each pixel may be represented by a 24 bit integer number. These 24 bits may be partitioned into 8 bits representing the redness, 8 bits of greenness, and 8 bits of blueness. When combined in an appropriate fashion these values define the color of the pixel.<br><br>
[0005]	The first bit of each 8-bit group (bit 7 of each color) is generally more significant<br>
(msb) than the last bit (Isb or bit 0 of each color). In other words, while the use of 8 bits allows for the indication of 256 shades of a color, the left-most bits (bit 7 of each color), which indicate whether at least some significant amount (usually half or a value of 128) of the color (red, green, or blue) is or is not present in the pixel, are more important than the<br><br>
right-most bits (usually a single bit or a value of 1), which indicate subtleties in the pixel's color that, while improving the quality of the image when present, are not necessary to providing at least some recognizable image, in contrast to the more important bits. Stated differently, the first bit contributes more to the overall picture quality than the following bits, which incrementally improve the quality afforded by the first bit.<br>
[0006]	The present invention further recognizes that the principle of "importance" extends<br>
to other encodings/compressed data as well. More generally, it applies to any data in multimedia streams that represent magnitude. It can also apply to the relative importance of different types of multimedia data. Some data may be more sensitive to errors while other data might be more sensitive to delays.<br>
[0007]	For digitized video, in addition to the pixel data discussed above such magnitude-<br>
indicating data in compressed streams can include header information, motion vectors, and DCT coefficients. In digitized audio, magnitude-indicating data in uncompressed streams can include MdBs of PCM data, or in compressed streams can include spectral envelope information and bandpass scaled signals. Also, some frequencies of an audible sound represented in a stream might be more important than other frequencies that make up the sound.<br>
[0008]	Having made the above critical observation, the present invention further<br>
understands that in a transmission channel that might be divided into separate sub-channels, such as Walsh channels, the total power gain amplification might be limited by regulation but how the total gain is allocated between the channels is not. That is, the present invention recognizes that is possible to establish different gain amplifications on subchannels as long as the sum of the sub-channel gains do not exceed the limit. With the above considerations in mind, the present invention has been provided.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The invention establishes different power gain amplification for different parts of a<br>
multimedia stream, based on relative "importance" or "sensitivity to errors" or "desire for data correctness" or "sensitivity to delay" of the different parts. Specifically, more important parts are amplified more than less important parts.<br>
[0010]	Accordingly, a method for multimedia data transmission includes establishing at<br>
least first and second amplification gains for at least first and second parts, respectively, of<br><br>
a multimedia data stream representing a single program, based on relative importances of the parts. The first and second amplification gains are different from each other. Preferably, a more important part has a higher gain than a less important part.<br>
[0011]	The multimedia data stream can be broadcast using wireless transmission principles<br>
or it can be transmitted over cable, including over the Internet. Also, the multimedia stream can be partitioned into more than two parts, with each part having its own gain amplification.<br>
[0012]	As set forth in greater detail below, the first and second parts can be first and second<br>
groups of bits representing a single magnitude. The magnitude can be a magnitude of a single pixel, and more specifically the magnitude can be a magnitude of a single color of a single pixel. Or, the first and second parts can be first and second groups of bits in a header of a video stream, or first and second groups of bits in a motion vector of a video stream, or first and second groups of bits in a DCT coefficient in a video stream, or first and second groups of bits representing spectral envelope information in an audio stream, or first and second groups of bits representing bandpass scaled signals in an audio stream, or other appropriate bits. In any case, the first group of bits is more significant than the second group of bits. The first and second parts can also represent data or other multimedia information of varying importance, sensitivity to error or sensitivity to delay.<br>
[0013]	In another aspect, a system for transmitting at least one multimedia data stream<br>
representing a single multimedia program includes a data divider partitioning the stream into at least first and second parts. A first amplifier applies a first gain to the first part, and a second amplifier applies a second gain to the second part. A transmitter transmits the data stream.<br>
[0014]	In yet another aspect, a communication system for multimedia data transmission<br>
includes means for applying at least first and second amplification gains to at least first and second parts, respectively, of a multimedia data stream representing a single program, based on relative importance of the parts. The first and second gains are different from each other.<br>
[0015]	The multimedia data can be subdivided into numerically equivalent parts. One non-<br>
limiting example would be to select every other pixel for one part and the alternate pixels for the second part. The first part could be sent with a greater gain than the second part. Another non-limiting case would be to select the odd frames for part one and the even<br><br>
frames for part two. Again, the first part could be sent with a greater gain than the second part. The relative importance of the parts may be viewed as numerically equal parts but may still be assigned different gains. The details of the present invention, both as to its structure and operation, can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0016]	Figure 1 is a simplified block diagram of one exemplary multimedia stream<br>
transmitter;<br>
[0017]	Figure 2 is a simplified block diagram of one exemplary multimedia stream<br>
receiver; and<br>
[0018]	Figure 3 is a flow chart of the present logic.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019]	The non-limiting preferred embodiment shown in Figure 1 illustrates multimedia<br>
broadcast using wireless means, and more particularly using code division multiple access (CDMA) principles including OFDM principles. It is to be understood that the present principles apply to other forms of wireless communication such as GSM, TDMA, wideband CDMA, EDGE, Digital TV, conventional TV, radio, iBiquity (IBOC) digital radio, XM, etc. as well as broadcast transmission of multimedia over cable systems, the Internet, etc. By "broadcast" is meant transmisison to plural receivers in the area covered by the broadcast, as opposed to, e.g., point-to-point transmission between a wireless communication infrastructure and a wireless telephone. It is to be understood that the present principles also apply to point-to-point and Multicast transmissions. It is to be further understood that while for simplicity the disclosure below assumes that a multimedia stream has only two data partitions and, hence, uses only two code channels, additional partitions based on relative importance can be used.<br>
[0020]	As used herein in the singular, "multimedia stream" means a single stream<br>
representing a single program, e.g., a single music piece or a single television show or movie. The term "Multimedia Stream" defines a group of related information, the distinct components of which are to be referred to in this document as "Multimedia Sub-streams" or just "Sub-streams", which when combined, provide a complete composite experience for<br><br>
the users or receivers of that multimedia stream. An example would be music data accompanied by a picture and perhaps some text. The music, picture and text data could be divided into three sub-streams and different gain amplifications applied to each. Indeed, different parts of closed-captioning text may be amplified differently from each other. The digitized and compressed audio could be amplified and transmitted separately from the picture data, which in turn could be separate from the text data. Still further, graphics overlays, video add-ons, and audio add-ons that are associated with a video stream could be amplified at a different (e.g., lower) gains than the underlying audio stream. In general, the present invention applies to data having parts of relative importances, e.g., full text documents might be of less importance and thus amplified less than an accompanying schematic diagram.<br>
[0021]	Focusing back on broadcast multimedia, a receiver- could   gather the various<br>
"Multimedia Sub-streams" and present them in a manner appropriate for the receiving device or player. For clarity, when combined, the three sub-streams comprise a "Multimedia Stream". "Multimedia stream" when used in the singular accordingly does not encompass commonly broadcast or commonly carried multiple distinct program streams.<br>
[00221	As shown in Figure 1, a system 10 can include at least one transmitter 12 that<br>
receives multimedia programs from a source 14 of multimedia data. As also shown in Figure 1, a multimedia data stream is input to a data divider 16, which partitions at least portions of the stream into a more important part 18 and a less important part 20, although the stream can be partitioned into more parts than two. As discussed in the example below, the partitioning can be done in accordance with a predetermined importance of the parts. It is to be understood that the data divider 16 can be placed just above the below-described amplifiers 32 when only variable power gain is to be used. For completeness of disclosure Figures 1 and 2 assume that in addition to variable power gain, variable error encoding can also be used on the two or more parts of the stream and, hence, that the data divider is placed where shown, although for purposes of the present invention variable error encoding need not be used. In the non-limiting embodiment shown in Figure 1, the two partitions are then processed in respective channels. First, if desired, each part 18,20 is processed by a respective error coder 22M, 22L for error coding, although for purposes of the present invention both parts can have the same error coding applied. While any appropriate error coding can be used, in one non-limiting exemplary embodiment the coding may include<br><br>
replicating or repeating each bit N times, wherein N  1such that each part 18,20 is coded at a respective coding rate. The "coding rate" refers to the ratio of original source bits to the number of bits after coding has been applied.<br>
R = B/A<br>
Where R refers to the coding Rate, B is the number of bits before coding and A is the number of bits after coding. The greater the repetition of bits the stronger the code and the more resistant to channel errors.<br>
[0023]	The coding rate used for the less important part 20 can be greater than the coding<br>
rate used for the more important part 18, although for purposes of variable power gain amplification of the present invention this is not necessary. Thus, as intimated above the discussion of the encoders 22 is provided for completeness when variable encoding is to be applied in addition to variable gain amplification, the coding rate for the less important part can be unity, i.e., the less important part might not be error coded at all. When more than two partitions (divided by importance) are used, the coding rates of the three or more parts can be successively greater, from more important to less important. That is, more important bits undergo more error coding-related replication than less important bits. As mentioned above, however, instead of using the same type of coding for each part and varying the rates, stronger and weaker error coding schemes can be respectively used for the more important and less important parts. It is conceivable that a multimedia stream could have sub-streams which are of equal importance. In this instance those sub-streams could be coded at the same coding rate.<br>
[0024]	With particular regard to the exemplary non-limiting wireless multimedia<br>
transmission set forth herein, after error coding the parts 18, 20 can be processed by " - ■ respective interleaves 24M, 24L in accordance with principles known in the art. The symbols in the error correction encoded symbol stream for each channel can be converted to real integers (e.g., "0" to aplus one and "1" to aminus one) and then digitally multiplied at 26M, 26L by an assigned Walsh function or sequence from a respective Walsh generator 28M,28L. Then, the parts 18,20 can be multiplied at 3OM,3OL by respective gain factors Gi, G2 provided from gain amplifiers 32M, 32L.<br>
[0025]	As intended by the present invention, the more important part is amplified more<br>
than the less important part. More specifically, Gi &gt; G2. The present invention understands that while regulations require the total gain G = Gi + G2 to be less than a specified value,<br><br>
the individual channel gains Gi, G2 advantageously can be established to be different from each other as appropriate for the relative importances of the respective parts of the stream to which they are applied.<br>
[0026]	Continuing, the parts 18, 20 may next be digitally multiplied at 50M, 50L by or<br>
combined with an outer pseudorandom (PN) code from a respective PN generator 36M, 36L after converting it to a sequence of the real field. The resulting spread symbol streams for each signal are then combined together at a summer 38 to form a composite waveform for transmission using a transmitter antenna 40. It is to be understood that the summer 38 can be interposed at other locations in the transmitter downstream of the amplifiers 32 to combine the two channels into one when only different error correction coding is used. In relevant part and for simplicity, a receiver 42 of the exemplary non-limiting wireless system . • 10 is shown in Figure 2 to be the inverse of the transmitter 12. Specifically, the receiver 42 can include a receiver antenna 44 with associated signal processing circuitry known in the art that produces the digitized multimedia stream that had been transmitted. The stream is sent to a data divider 46, which partitions the stream into a more important part 48 and a less important part 50 using the same criteria that was used by the data divider 16 of the transmitter 12.<br>
[0027]	The parts 48,50 are de-spread at 52M, 52L using respective PN sequences from PN<br>
generators 54M, 54L. The PN sequences used for de-spreading are the same as those used for spreading in the transmitter 12. If desired, the gains of the parts 48,50 can be variably adjusted at 56M, 56L using signals from respective gain amplifiers 58M, 58Lthat function inversely to the amplifiers 32 shown in Figure 1.<br>
[0028]	'Next, the parts are Walsh-demodulated at 60M, 60L using signals from respective<br>
Walsh generators 62M, 62L in accordance with principles known in the wireless communication art. The parts 48, 50 are next de-interleaved at respective de-interleavers 64M, 64L.<br>
[0029]	When variable error coding is to be used in addition to variable gain amplification<br>
respective error decoders 66M, 66L decode the parts 48,50 using the inverse of the error correction codings that were applied by the transmitter 12 to the parts 18,20. Accordingly, the error decoder 66M uses a coding to decode the more important part 48 that corresponds to the coding used by the encoder 22M and the decoder 66L for the less important part 50 uses a coding that corresponds to the coding used by the encoder 22L. As discussed above,<br><br>
when more than two partitions are used, the codings of the three or more parts can be successively stronger, from more important to less important The parts 48, 50 are then combined at a combiner 68 (such as a summer or other transform) to produce the original multimedia data stream, indicated at block 70 of Figure 2. When only variable gain amplification is to be used, the parts can be combined just upstream of 56M, 56L. When the parts are combined together at the receiver they form an image resolution that is greater than either the first or second part alone.<br>
[0030]	Figure 3 illustrates the logic of the present invention. Commencing at block 72, it is<br>
determined how the stream is to be partitioned. As discussed above, two or more partitions can be used, based on the relative importance of the parts of the stream or other useful partitions of the multimedia stream. For instance, it might be decided that each 8-bit group representing a pixel color for a single frame of a video stream will be partitioned into two parts, with the more important part being the left-most (most significant) 6 bits and the less important part being the remaining two bits, as shown below:<br><br>
[0031]	Or, the group can divided evenly, with the four left-most (most significant) bits<br>
being in the more important part and the four less significant bits being in the less important part thusly:<br><br>
[0032]	Other bit divisions can be used. Yet again, the 8-bit group can be partitioned into   .<br>
three or more groups. Still further, other data in a compressed stream, particularly magnitude-indicating data such as certain header data, motion vectors, and DCT<br><br>
coefficients for video data*and spectral envelope information and bandpass scaled signals for audio data, can be partitioned into more important and less important parts. For data, pictures, text, graphics and other types of multimedia streams or sub-streams, there are many other useful partitioning schemes. For instance, the present invention may be applied to magnitude measures in broadcast graphics including object size, warping, translation, point of view, lighting, rotation orientation, perspective, etc. as well as to different graphics objects to which the user may attach different "importance". Moreover, in addition to audio, video, text, and graphics, the invention may apply to more and less important parts of general data, picture control information encryption keys system control decoding parameters, basis function sets, ordering information related to HTML, URLs, etc. Still further, the first and second parts can be first and second groups of Wavelet coefficients in a group of Wavelet coefficients in a video stream, or first and second groups of spectral transform coefficients in a group of spectral transform coefficients in a video stream, or first and second groups of Graphics parameters in a group of Graphics parameters in a graphics stream, or first and second groups of pixels in a video frame.<br>
[0033]	In any case, the partitioning scheme at block 72 is used by the data dividers 16,46<br>
of the transmitter and receiver to partition the stream. If desired, block 70 can be undertaken once and provided to the receiver 42 prior to multimedia stream broadcast, or it can be undertaken dynamically, with the particular partitioning scheme being broadcast to the receiver 42 at broadcast time. Alternatively, a receiver could have partitioning information stored in memory or transmitted by another physical layer.<br>
[0034]	Moving to block 72, the transmitter 12 partitions the stream in accordance with the<br>
partitioning scheme as discussed above. At blocks 76 and 78, the amplifiers 32M, 32L (Figure 1) apply their respective gains to their respective parts of the stream. Specifically, the more important parts are amplified more at block 76 than the less important parts that are amplified at block 78. While blocks 76 and 78 are shown in series for convenience of disclosure, the amplification of the different parts can be done in parallel as described in reference to Figure 1. Proceeding to block 80, the parts of the stream undergo the subsequent processing described above, and then are transmitted.<br>
[0035]	While the particular MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSION USING VARIABLE GAIN<br>
AMPLIFICATION BASED ON DATA IMPORTANCE as herein shown and described in detail is fully capable of attaining the above-described objects of the invention, it is to be<br><br>
