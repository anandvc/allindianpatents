Device in a weaving loom for forming leno edges and weaving<br>
loom having said device<br>
The invention relates to a device in a weaving loom for forming leno edges which extend parallel with the warp threads of a fabric to be produced in multiple widths and whose leno threads and the warp threads bind the inserted weft thread.<br>
The invention also relates to a loom which is equipped with a device of this type.<br>
A device of the type mentioned in the introduction is known from DE 197 20 634 CI. Details of this known device are also set out in DE 44 05 776 CI and DE 44 05 777 CI.<br>
In the present application, the term "leno edge" is intended to refer to any type of edge which is formed on a fabric by the leno threads being twisted. This can, for example, be a fabric edge which remains permanently on the fabric and forms a closure as well as protection for this fabric during use. However, it can also be a catch selvedge edge which prevents the inserted weft threads from withdrawing from the warp threads at the edge side. A leno edge of this type is formed from the leno threads which are drawn from specific leno bobbins.<br>
In the known device according to DE 197 20 634 CI, at least two leno mechanisms having a common axis of rotation are arranged beside each other. Each leno mechanism is constructed as a rotating member in the form of a planar annular disc which is driven from the outer side and whose inner side has no attachments. The rotation axis of the<br><br>
rotors is therefore not constructed in the structural sense but is intended to be understood as a notional geometric axis. This construction of the known leno mechanisms allows the leno threads drawn from individual bobbins to be able to be twisted together by means of a half-rotation of the stator and a complete leno weave to be produced on the last weft thread(s) inserted. Using the known devices, it is possible to simultaneously produce two different leno edges on the fabric produced during the actual weaving operation. This can, for example, be a fabric edge and a catch selvedge edge which are located at the edge of the fabric spaced from each other. Using a separation device, the catch selvedge having an edge is separated from the completed fabric whilst the fabric edge remains on the completed fabric.<br>
Although consideration had originally been given only to providing leno edges of this type on the edges of the fabric produced during the weaving operation, owing to the pressure to achieve economical production it has become increasingly necessary to produce the fabric with double width and separate it following the weaving operation. It is thereby possible to achieve a higher level of efficiency in terms of insertion and a reduction of weft waste. It thereby became necessary also to provide fabric edges in the centre, that is to say, at the edges of adjacent fabric webs, in the construction with complete leno weaves. Using the device according to DE 197 20 634 CI, it is at least possible to readily carry out a production method of this type if the warp threads are drawn from part warp beams so that the centre spacing required for the arrangement of the two leno mechanisms is provided. However, it is increasingly desirable to draw the warp threads from a continuous warp beam (single-beam goods) and nonetheless produce two or more fabric webs.<br><br>
In this method of operation, the warp thread assemblies in the rear shed are consequently no longer separated, with the result that the space for arranging the leno mechanisms between the edge warp threads of the respective fabric web is very small. Warp threads and leno threads may come into contact with each other since the warp threads cross the leno mechanism. With fine yarns, occurrences of tangling are thereby brought about or, in the filament region, if the warp has no twists or only protective twists, occurrences of capillary damage. This may result in an increased level of warp breakages and machine downtimes and therefore a production loss.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a device of the type mentioned in the introduction, by means of which multiple-width fabrics with leno edges can also be produced as complete leno weaves on looms having continuous warp beams, without the danger of the weaving operation being disrupted or quality being impaired.<br>
This object is achieved with the features of claim 1 as a whole.<br>
It consequently comprises a device in which two leno mechanisms are mounted one behind the other to form one structural unit and further comprises the following features:<br>
a)	each leno mechanism has a stator and a driven rotor;<br>
b)	the rotation axes of the rotors extend substantially parallel with each other;<br>
c)	each rotor has at least two thread-guiding devices, through which at least two leno threads are guided in order to form a leno shed;<br><br>
d) the rotation axis of at least one of the rotors is arranged in an axially parallel manner spaced from the rotation axis of the other rotor or other rotors.<br>
The device according to the invention consequently retains the advantages of the known leno mechanisms according to DE 197 20 634 CI which advantageously allows the production of leno edges as complete leno weaves and affords particular advantages in terms of the independent control of the at least two leno mechanisms. However, the known device is modified in such a manner that the rotation axis of at least one of the rotors is located in the direction of the warp threads spaced from the rotation axis of the rotor or other rotor(s). The leno mechanisms are consequently no longer arranged beside each other, but instead one behind the other in a tandem-like arrangement in the direction of the warp threads. The stators and the associated retaining members are therefore also installed one behind the other in the travel direction of the warp threads. The device as a whole therefore becomes narrower; it is constructed along the length and no longer over the width. This allows the warp threads to be arranged in the assembly even when they are drawn not from part warp beams, but instead from a continuous warp beam.<br>
An advantageous further development of the device according to the invention consists in the rotors which are located spaced from each other being arranged in alignment with each other in the direction of the warp threads. This naturally also has an effect on the arrangement of the associated stators and the retaining members thereof. When the leno mechanisms are arranged one behind the other in strict<br><br>
alignment with each other the greatest possible saving of space is achieved over the width of the fabric.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration, it is further significant for the rotors to be constructed as planar annular discs and, for example, for each annular disc to be the rotor of an electric motor. Space is also thereby saved over the width and an elongation of the device is promoted in a plane perpendicular relative to the fabric web.<br>
Furthermore, according to an advantageous configuration, a stepped arrangement of the diameter of the rotors which are located one behind the other is provided so that the diameter thereof increases counter to the direction in which the fabric is drawn off. The rotors and therefore all of the leno mechanisms are thus adapted to the front shed of the shed by the diameter thereof increasing from the beat-up edge of the fabric to the maximum height of the shed. In the most simple case, a leno mechanism having small external dimensions will consequently be followed by a second leno mechanism having larger external dimensions, the external dimensions being determined above all by the diameters of the rotors. However, the corresponding construction is also readily provided in a device having more than two leno mechanisms which are arranged one behind the other. The device is thus optimally adapted to the dimension of the opened shed which is formed by the warp threads and the leno threads which are located therebetween. Consequently, an unimpeded insertion of the weft threads is also ensured.<br>
Advantageously, the device according to the invention, according to another configuration, is fixed, with all the leno mechanisms thereof, to a common retaining member which<br><br>
can be pivoted about an axis which extends parallel with the insertion direction of the weft threads and which can be displaced on this axis. In this manner, the device can be finely adjusted by means of pivoting. Above all, however, a displacement over the width of the fabric produced is possible, with the result that a right-hand and a left-hand leno edge can be produced on each fabric web in fabrics having two or more webs. The device is generally fixed to the machine frame from above, with the result that the device extends slightly into the warp thread assembly from above and can be pivoted upwards when not in use. It is also conceivable to have an arrangement such that the device extends into the warp thread assembly from below and can be pivoted downwards when not in use.<br>
A further configuration of this retaining member consists in individual leno mechanisms being fixed independently to the retaining member in a replaceable and transversely displaceable manner. In addition to the advantage of replaceability, there is also the additional advantage here that the strict alignment of the individual rotors which are arranged one behind the other can be relaxed to a specific degree so that a degree of spacing is provided from the outset for the leno edges produced. However, this possibility can be used only to a limited extent, otherwise the advantage of space-saving is lost again.<br>
It is further advantageous, in the device according to the invention, for individual driving for all the rotors and a control device to be provided, by means of which all the rotors can be operated independently of each other. In a configuration of this type, the starting time of the rotors for each leno edge can be selected independently from that of<br><br>
another and it is also possible to carry out the binding operation differently for each leno edge after one or more weft thread insertions.<br>
According to another configuration with regard to this detail, the weaving reed or an additional weaving reed-like device, for example, an auxiliary weaving reed, is incorporated in the guide of the leno threads.<br>
According to claim B,   the invention also relates to a loom having at least one device according to any one of claims 1 to 8; this loom produces a fabric which comprises at least two fabric webs. The device according to the invention is arranged between the warp thread assemblies of the two fabric webs. The most simple case consists in only one device according to claims 1 to p  being arranged for forming leno edges between the warp thread assemblies.<br>
It is, however, also readily possible to sub-divide a warp thread assembly several times and to arrange a plurality of the arrangements according to the invention in a state distributed over the width of the warp thread assemblies.<br>
Although the device according to the invention, owing to the narrow construction thereof, is particularly advantageous when arranged over the width of the fabric produced or the warp thread assembly, a further advantageous construction of the loom also consists in devices according to the invention being provided at the weft thread insertion and withdrawal side edge of the fabric produced and producing a leno edge in a catch selvedge beside the fabric edge. In addition, a loom can then be equipped with devices for forming leno edges of<br><br>
only one type. Economic advantages are thereby gained in terms of procurement and storage of spare parts.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to an embodiment. In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of a loom which is equipped<br>
with the device according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a partial view along line A-B in Figure 1.<br>
In Figure 1, 1 indicates the warp threads which are conveyed from right to left in the withdrawal direction 4 of the fabric in Figure 1. 2 designates a weft thread which is inserted in the insertion direction 5 transversely relative to the warp threads into the shed which is open as usual. The warp threads 1 and weft threads 2 together form the fabric produced or the fabric web 3 which is drawn from the loom in the withdrawal direction 4. 6 designates a separation device.<br>
As already mentioned in the introduction, specific fabrics are currently woven in multiple widths and subsequently separated. In the embodiment illustrated, the weaving operation is carried out with double fabric width and the two halves are subsequently separated using the separation device 6 and further processed independently. 7 designates a weaving reed by means of which the last weft thread(s) inserted is/are beaten up to the beating-up edge of the fabric and a catch selvedge. In this respect, the construction of a loom forms part of the prior art and does not need to be explained in greater detail.<br>
The device according to the invention for forming leno edges is fixed to a transverse shaft 9 which is connected to the<br><br>
machine frame by means of a retaining member 10. A clamping sleeve 11 is fitted onto the transverse shaft 9 and can be rotated about the transverse shaft 9 and displaced longitudinally thereon, cf. in this regard direction arrow 31. A first retaining wall 12 is suspended on the clamping sleeve 9 and is connected to a second retaining wall 13 by means of a fixable slide seat 14. Using the slide seat 14, the second retaining wall 13 can be displaced transversely relative to the direction of the warp threads relative to the first retaining wall 12 and also fixed again, cf. direction arrow 32. The slide seat is, however, also separable and allows the second retaining wall with the device located thereon to be replaced. The clamping sleeve 11, the first retaining wall 12, the second retaining wall 13 and the fixable slide seat 14 together form a retaining member for the two leno mechanisms which are described below.<br>
The first leno mechanism comprises according to Figure 2 the first stator 15, which is fixed to the second retaining wall 13, and the first rotor 16. The second leno mechanism is formed by the second stator 17 and the second rotor 18. The second stator 17 is fixed to the first retaining wall 12 at the points 12a, 12b in this case. Figure 2 clearly indicates the fixing of the stators to the retaining walls with the fixing cams which are formed thereon and the associated holes.<br>
The diameter of the first rotor 16 is smaller than the diameter of the second rotor 18. This also applies to the stators 15, 17 which surround the rotors 16, 18. The leno mechanisms are therefore substantially adapted to the maximum opening of the shed which is formed by the heald frames 8 and which can be seen in Figure 2 with reference to the path of the leno threads 27 and 28. This construction facilitates the<br><br>
adaptation of the device for forming the leno edges to the path of the shed and consequently also the arrangement thereof in the region of the rear shed 35 directly downstream of the heald frames 8.<br>
19 to 22 designate four bobbins on which the four leno threads 23, 24 and 27 and 28 are located. 25, 26 and 29, 30 designate thread guiding eyelets which form the devices for thread guiding in this embodiment. The first leno thread 23 is drawn from the first bobbin 19 and is directed to the first rotor 16 via the thread guiding eyelet 25. The second leno thread 24 is drawn from the second bobbin 20 and is directed to the first rotor 16 via the thread guiding eyelet 26. When the first rotor 16 rotates, the first leno thread 23 and the second leno thread 24 become twisted on the inserted weft thread and thereby bind it. This is possible since the first rotor is constructed in the form of a planar annular disc and is driven from the periphery thereof. The inner space of the first rotor 16 has no attachments and therefore allows the first leno thread 23 to cross the second leno thread 24 in an unimpeded manner.<br>
The second leno mechanism having the larger diameter is constructed in a corresponding manner. In this instance, a third leno thread 27 is drawn from the third bobbin 21 and a fourth leno thread 28 is drawn from the fourth bobbin 22 and directed to the second rotor 18 by means of the thread guiding eyelets 29 and 30. The third leno thread 27 can consequently also be twisted with the fourth leno thread 28, with a complete leno edge being formed so that the last weft thread 2 inserted is securely retained.<br><br>
In order to prevent occurrences of tangling between the leno threads 23, 24; 27, 28 and the edge warp threads of the warp adjacent to the leno mechanism, so-called spacers 37, 38 may be placed at an appropriate location in the withdrawal direction 4 upstream of the leno mechanisms.<br>
The external driving of the two rotors can be carried out, for example, by means of belts which are driven by a common electric drive motor or by individual drive motors. The rotors can, however, also be constructed as rotors of electric motors whose stators are at the same time those of the leno device. These details are known from DE 197 20 634 CI which has already been mentioned so that reference can be made thereto in this regard.<br>
The rotors of the two leno mechanisms rotate about notional geometric rotation axes 33 and 34 which extend transversely relative to the direction of the warp threads, that is to say, parallel with the insertion direction 5 of the weft threads 2. The two notional axes of rotation 33 and 34 are arranged one behind the other spaced apart in the travel direction of the warp threads. In the illustration according to Figure 1, the two leno mechanisms are aligned in the withdrawal direction of the warp threads 1 and the fabric 3 produced. They therefore occupy a smaller width than the multiple leno mechanisms which are known from the prior art and which are arranged beside each other with a common axis. As can be clearly be seen in particular from Figure 1, the device for forming leno edges can therefore readily be installed in the centre of the warp thread assembly of the fabric to be produced.<br><br>
In the illustration according to Figure 1, all the leno threads are directed to the rotors 16 and 18 in the travel direction of the warp threads to the left, that is to say, downwards in the Figure, and leave the rotors in the travel direction to the right, that is to say, upwards in the illustration. They are therefore close beside each other when leaving the first leno mechanism.<br>
The function of the device according to the invention for forming leno edges can readily be seen from the above description. The leno threads 23, 24 and 27 and 28 are drawn from the bobbins 19 to 22, guided through the rotors 16 and 18 and, after the insertion of at least one weft thread 2, twisted together in pairs, so that the weft threads which have been inserted are bound and fixed. Since the leno threads are also twisted at the inlet side of the rotors, the direction of rotation must be reversed after a specific number of rotations. During individual driving operation of the two rotors and with a corresponding independent control, it is possible to freely program the number of rotations after which a reversal of the rotation direction should be carried out for each of the two leno mechanisms. It is therefore possible to carry out a twisting and binding operation with a first leno edge, for example, after each weft thread insertion, but only after every third or fifth weft insertion with a second leno edge. The speed and the start and stop time of each rotor can also be programmed independently of the other rotor. Limitations are imposed in this case only by the sequence of the weaving operation which, at least during shed formation, requires a degree of synchronous operation of the leno mechanisms with the loom.<br><br>
By displacing the clamping sleeve 11 on the transverse shaft 9,   the location of the device for forming leno edges over the width of the fabric to be produced can be adjusted. It is therefore possible to divide the warp longitudinally into various widths. Using the fixable slide seat 14, it is also possible to adjust the first leno mechanism 16, 17 in addition relative to the second leno mechanism 17, 18 so that the location of various leno edges can also be varied. However, the greatest saving of space is achieved if the two leno mechanisms are in alignment with each other, as illustrated in Figure 1. The first leno mechanism can also readily be replaced with another using the fixable slide seat 14.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, two leno mechanisms are arranged one behind the other. However, it is also readily possible to have an arrangement with more than two leno mechanisms.<br>
Finally, the device described in this instance having leno mechanisms which are arranged one behind the other and in alignment can also be fitted to the outer edges at the weft thread insertion and withdrawal side of a fabric to be produced.<br><br><br>
