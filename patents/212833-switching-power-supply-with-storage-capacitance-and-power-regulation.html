SWITCHING POWER SUPPLY WITH STORAGE CAPACITANCE AND POWER REGULATION<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to power supply systems and, more particularly, to off-line power supplies for supplying a d-c. output from an a-c. power source. A particularly useful application for the present invention is in bias supplies and other cost-sensitive applications such as appliances using microprocessors.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,790,390 describes a power supply system that includes an a-c. power source and an off-line power supply for storing energy from the a-c, power source during first selected time intervals and converting at least a portion of the stored energy to a d-c. output during second selected time intervals. A diode or other switch disconnects the off-line power supply from the a-c. power source during the second selected time intervals to reduce conducted EMI. The first and second selected time intervals are preferably synchronized to the frequency of the a-c. power source.<br>
It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved off-line power supply of the general type described in the aforementioned patent but having improved efficiency.<br>
Another important object of this invention is to provide an improved off-line isolated power supply which provides constant d-c. output power over a wide a-c. input voltage and temperature range.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to provide such an improved off-line power supply which is extremely reliable in operation, and can be made with a rugged construction.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing objectives are realized by providing a power supply system comprising an a-c. power source; an off-line power supply for storing energy from the a-c. power source during first selected time intervals and converting at least a portion of the stored energy to a d-c. output during second selected time intervals; means for disconnecting the off-line power supply from the a-c, power source during the second selected time intervals to reduce conducted EMI; and<br><br>
power-regulation means for preventing variations in the first and second selected time intervals due to a-c, input voltage and temperature variations. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the power-regulation means is effective at operating a-c. input voltages ranging from 85 to 265 and temperatures ranging from below zero degrees C. to above 75 degrees C.<br>
The off-line power supply of this invention preferably includes switching means for controlling the first and second selected time intervals, and energy-conserving means for storing energy for triggering the switching means during the second selected time intervals so as to avoid continuous power consumption during those intervals.<br>
Brief Description Of The Drawings<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a bias-supply system embodying the invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an alternative bias-supply system embodying the invention.<br>
Detailed Description Of Preferred Embodiments<br>
While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. It should be understood, however, that it is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but, on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the ... ^_ -   . i.ij in* mtion defined by the appended claims.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates a bias supply system for receiving a-c. power from an external source connected to a pair of input terminals 10a and 10b and supplying a regulated d-c. output at a pair of output terminals I la and lib. The a-c. signal from one input terminal is applied through a fuse Fl and a resistor Rl to the anode of a diode Dl which functions as a half-wave rectifier to pass only the positive half cycles of the a-c. input. The resistor Rl functions as a current-limiting resistor to limit the in-rush of energy from the input terminals when the diode Dl is conducting.<br>
From the diode Dl, the rectified power input is passed to a storage capacitor CI to store the incoming energy. The capacitor CI is charged during each positive half cycle of the a-c. input, and is periodically discharged during the time intervals when DI<br><br>
is not conducting. This effectively disconnects the supply from the a-c. input line during the power transfer to the output. When the capacitor CI discharges, the stored energy flows through the primary winding Lp of a transformer Tl connected in series with a FET Q6, The FET is controlled by a control circuit (described below) which controls the transfer of power to the d-c. output by turning the FET on and off<br>
The diode Dl functions as a disconnect switch to disconnect the off-line power supply from the a-c. power source while the CI energy is being transferred to the output, which is when most of the conductive EMI is generated. Consequently, most of the conductive EMI generated by the off-line power supply is confined to the power supply itself, and cannot interfere with other circuits or devices, As will be apparent from the following description, most of the switching and inductive changes that produce EMI in the off-line power supply occur during the power transfer while the diode is in its disconnect mode. If desired, an active switching device may be used in place of the diode Dl, which functions as a passive switch.<br>
Whenever the FET Q6 is cumed on, current flows through the primary winding Lp of the transformer Tl which stores energy as an inductor of inductance Lp. This current ramps up to a peak value, Ipk, which flows through a resistor R2 connected between the FET Q6 and common. Ipk produces a voltage across the resistor R2 which causes the control circuit to turn off the FET Q6, With the FET Q6 off, the magnetic field built up in the primary winding of the transformer Tl collapses, and the energy present in the field is transferred to the secondary winding Lg of the transformer Tl. This produces an output current which flows through a diode D2 to the output terminal<br>
1 la and returning through termii.	  .   ^ capacitor C2 connected across the output<br>
terminals smoothes the output, and a zeiv^r diode D3 in parallel with the capacitor C2 regulates the output voltage. The diode D2 prevents conduction in the secondary winding of the transformer Tl while the capacitor CI is discharging through the primary winding.<br>
The illustrative bias-supply system provides a constant power output. The control circuit 10 turns off the FET Q6 when the voltage across the resistor R2 builds up to a preselected level representing a maximum current value Ipk that is slightly befow the level where the core of the transformer TI starts saturating. That is, the value of Ipk determines the power Eout stored in the primary winding Lp, as can be seen from the following formula:<br><br>
Eout = Vi Lplpic^ where Lp is the inductance of the primary winding of the transformer and Ipk is the maximum current through the resistor R2.<br>
The control circuit controls the FET Q6 to transfer energy from the capacitor Cl to the transformer Tl during a single time interval in each negative half cycle of the a-c. input. In this circuit, the voltage drop across a pair of resistors R3 and R4 determines when a transistor Ql is turned off, which occurs during positive half cycles of the a-c. input when the base-emitter voltage Vbe of the transistor Ql is positive. When the transistor Ql is off, the FET Q6 and a pair of transistors Q2 and Q3 are held off while the capacitor Cl is charging. During the negative half cycle of the a-c. input, the transistor Ql base-emitter voltage Vbe goes to negative, and Ql turns on, which enables the FET Q6 to be turned on and the discharge of the capacitor Cl.<br>
The a-c. signal from one input terminal is applied through the resistors R3 and R4 to the anode of a diode D4 which, like the diode Dl, functions as a half-wave rectifier to pass only the positive half cycles of the a-c. input. From the diode D4, the rectified power input is passed to a storage capacitor C3 to store the incoming energy. Like the capacitor Cl, the capacitor C3 is charged during each positive half cycle of the a-c. input. A zener diode D5 limits the voltage across the capacitor C3 and normalizes the stored charge relatively independent of the a-c. input voltage. When the transistor Ql turns on, the capacitor C3 discharges through the emitter-collector circuit of the transistor Ql and a resistor R5 to the gate of the FET. This circuit provides the necessary voltage to turn on the FET Q6. The capacitor C3 and the zener D5 are selected so that the capacitor C3 stores only the amount of energy needed to turn on the FET Q6 for the time interval required to reach the Ipk value. This improves the efficiency of the circuit by reducing the power consumption of the circuit. A capacitor C4 connected across the diode D4 filters the noise from the a-c. input power source.<br>
When the FET Q6 is on, current from the capacitor Cl ramps through the FET Q6 so as to convey energy to the primary winding of the transformer TL The current ramp causes a transistor Q3 to turn on when the voltage across R2 builds up to the selected reference voltage Vref When the transistor Q3 turns on, it turns on the transistor Q2, The transistors Q2 and Q3 form a latch which turns off the FET Q6 by pulling down the voltage at the gate connection of the FET Q6. This latch holds the FET Q6 off until the capacitor C3 is discharged and the supply current to the transistors Q2<br><br>
and Q3 is depleted, thereby turning off the latch. Resistors R6 and R7 determine the current level at which the latch is turned off. A capacitor C5 is connected in parallel with the resistor R6 to reduce false triggering in the control circuit. When the FET Q6 turns off, the magnetic field built up in the primary winding of the transformer Tl collapses, and the energy in the primary winding transfers to the secondary winding.<br>
A zener diode D6 has its cathode connected to the gate of the FET Q6 through R5 to prevent the voltage at the gate of Q6 from reaching a level which could damage Q6 or cause improper operation. At the gate of the FET Q6, a diode D7 is connected between the source and gate of the FET to protect against negative spikes, and another diode D8 is connected in parallel with the resistor R5 to cause the FET to turn off quickly when the voltage at the gate of the FET is reduced by the latch.<br>
When the circuitry described thus far is used in applications involving a wide range of operating temperatures, the characteristics of the base-emitter junctions of the transistors Q2 and Q3 can vary with temperature, which in turn can change the time intervals during which the FET Q6 is on and off. Specifically, the voltage at which the transistor Q3 is turned on (the voltage across resistor R7) can vary with temperature. To avoid such variations in the time intervals, a low-power comparator including a pair of transistors Q4 and Q5 is connected to the gate and source of the FET Q6. This comparator has the effect of producing a sharp step voltage change across the resistor R7 so that the time at which the transistor Q3 is turned on is always substantially the same, regardless of changes in the specific voltage level required to turn on the transistor Q3 due to temperature changes.<br>
The comparator includes a voltage divider formed by resistors R8 and R9, which sets the comparator reference voltage Vref. This voltage divider applies a portion of the FET Q6 turn-on voltage to the base of the transistor Q4, while the base of the second transistor Q5 receives the voltage from the FET side of the resistor R2. When the voltage across the resistor R2 builds up to equal the reference voltage Vref, the transistor Q5 turns off and the transistor Q4 turns on, directing the current, set by the resistor RIO, to the resistor R7, The voltage developed across the resistor R7 subsequently turns on the latch and turns off the FET Q6. The base-emitter voltage's of both transistors Q4 and Q5 are sensitive to temperature, so they both change when the temperature changes, thereby preventing any change in the time intervals during which the FET is on or off due to temperature changes.<br><br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a modified control circuit 10 for discharging the capacitor CI in multiple time increments within each negative half cycle of the a-c. input, rather than in a single increment as in the circuit of FIG. 1. Discharging the capacitor CI in multiple time increments permits the discharge intervals to be shorter, with less energy per pulse, which in turn permits the use of a smaller transformer. This can be a significant advantage in applications having relatively large power requirements, which can cause the required transformer to become large in size.<br>
In the circuit of FIG. 2, as in FIG. 1, the a-c. signal from one input terminal 10a is applied through a fuse Fl and a resistor Rl to the anode of a diode Dl which functions as a half-wave rectifier to pass only the positive half cycles of the a-c. input. The resistor Rl functions as a current-limiting resistor to limit the in-rush of energy from the input terminals when the diode Dl is conducting. From the diode Dl, the rectified power input is passed to a storage capacitor CI to store the incoming energy, The capacitor CI is charged during each positive half cycle of the a-c. input, and is periodically discharged during the time intervals when Dl is not conducting. This effectively disconnects the supply from the a-c. input line during the power transfer to the output. When the capacitor CI discharges, the stored energy flows through the primary winding Lp of the transformer Tl connected in series with an integrated circuit 20 containing a FET.<br>
The integrated circuit 20 is an off-line switcher, such as the TNY253, 254 or 255 available from Power Integrations, Inc. of Sunnyvale, California. These integrated circuits include a high-voltage power MOSFET, an oscillator, a high-voltage switched current source, and current limit and therrr:al shutdown circuitry. The integrated circuit includes a drain pin D which is the drain connection to the MOSFET to provide internal operating current for both start-up and steady-state operation; a source pin S which is the source connection to the MOSFET; a bypass pin BP for connection to an external bypass capacitor CIO for an internally generated supply, and,an enable pin EN which enables the MOSFET to be turned on when the pin is high and permits the switching of the MOSFET to be terminated by pulling the pin low. As long as the enable pin EN remains high, the internal oscillator turns the MOSFET on at the beginning of each cycle of the oscillator output. The MOSFET is then turned off when the current ramps up to the current limit, and then on again at the beginning of the next cycle of the oscillator<br><br>
output. This cycling of the MOSFET on and off continues until the enable pin EN is pulled low.<br>
Returning to FIG. 2, the voltage level on the enable pin EN is controlled by a transistor QIO. A pair of resistors RIO and Rl 1 form a voltage divider which determines when the transistor QIO is turned on, which occurs when the voltage at the base of the transistor QIO reaches a selected threshold voltage Vji^ When the transistor QIO is on, the pin EN is pulled low to prevent switching of the MOSFET in the integrated circuit 20. When the voltage at the base of the transistor QIO falls below the threshold voltage VTI, the transistor QIO turns off, which causes the voltage on the enable pin EN to go high so that the MOSFET can be turned on at the beginning of the next cycle of the oscillator output. A resistor RI2 connected between the positive side of the capacitor CI and the pin EN determines the voltage level on the pin EN when the transistor QIO is off.<br>
A zener diode D10 has its cathode connected to the enable input EN of the integrated circuit 20 to prevent the voltage at the input EN from reaching a level which could damage the FET or cause improper operation. A capacitor CIO is connected to ground from the BP terminal of the switching module 20 to reduce false triggering in that module.<br>
