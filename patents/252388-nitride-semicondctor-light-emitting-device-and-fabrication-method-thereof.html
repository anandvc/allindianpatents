[DESCRIPTION]<br>
[Invention Title]<br>
NITRIDE SEMICONDCTOR LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE AND FABRICATION METHOD THEREOF<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a nitride semiconductor light-emitting device and fabrication method thereof.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Generally, GaN-based nitride semiconductors find its application fields in electronic devices (i.e., high-speed switching and high output devices) such as optical devices of blue/green LED (Light Emitting Diode), MESFET (Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) and HEMT (High Electron Mobility Transistors).<br>
The GaN based nitride semiconductor light emitting device is grown on a sapphire substrate or a SiC substrate. Then, an AlyGai-yN polycrystalline thin film is grown on the sapphire substrate or the SiC substrate as a buffer layer at a low growth temperature. Then, an undoped GaN layer, a Si-doped n-GaN layer, or a mixture of the above two structures is grown on the buffer layer at a high temperature to form an n-GaN layer. Also, a Mg-doped p-GaN layer is formed at upper layer to manufacture a nitride semiconductor light emitting device. An emission layer (a multiple quantum well structure activation layer) is interposed between the n-GaN layer and the p-GaN layer. A related art p-GaN layer is formed by doping Mg atoms while growing crystal. It is required that Mg atoms implanted as a doping source during crystalline growth be substituted by Ga location and thus serve as a p-GaN layer. The Mg atoms are combined with a hydrogen gas dissolved in a carrier gas and a source to form a Mg-H complex in a GaN crystalline layer, resulting in a high resistant material of about 10M?.<br>
2<br><br>
Accordingly, after a pn junction light-emitting device is formed, there is an need for a subsequent activation process for cutting the Mg-H complex and substituting the Mg atoms at the Ga location. However, in the light-emitting device, the amount of carriers contributing to light emission in the activation process is about 1017 /cm3, which is very lower than the Mg atomic concentration of 1019/cm3 or higher. Accordingly, there is a disadvantage in that it is very difficult to form a resistive contact. Furthermore, the Mg atoms remaining within the p-GaN nitride semiconductor without being activated as carriers serve as the center at which light emitted from the interface with the active layer is trapped, abruptly decreasing the optical output. In order to improve this problem, a method in which contact resistance is lowered to increase current injection efficiency using a very thin transparent resistive metal material has been employed.<br>
However, the thin transparent resistive metal used to decrease the contact resistance is about 75 to 80% in optical transmittance. The remaining optical transmittance serves as loss. More particularly, there is a limit to reducing an operating voltage due to high contact resistance.<br>

[Mode for Invention]<br>
The present invention will be described in detail below in connection with<br>
embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG.   1   is  a  view  schematically  showing  the  stack  structure  of a  nitride<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
A   nitride  semiconductor  light-emitting  device   1   according  to   the  present<br>
invention includes a buffer layer 4 formed on a substrate 2, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In this case, the buffer layer 4 can have one of an AlInN/GaN stack structure, an<br>
InGaN/GaN   superlattice   structure,   an   InxGa1_xN/GaN   stack   structure,   an<br>
AlxInyGaMx+v)N/InxGa[.xN/GaN stack structure (0<x x></x>
An   In-doped   GaN   layer  6  into  which   indium   is   doped   is  then   formed<br>
on  the  buffer layer 4.     A n-type first  electrode  layer is  fo  rmed  on  the<br>
In-doped GaN layer 6.    In this case,  a Si-In co-doped  GaN  layer 8  into<br><br>
which silicon and indium are doped at the same time can be adopted as<br>
the n-type first electrode layer.<br>
An InxGai-xN layer 10 having a low content of indium is also formed on<br>
the Si-In co-doped GaN layer S.   An active layer 12 for emitting light is<br>
formed on the InxGai-xN layer 10.   The active layer 12 can have a single<br>
quantum well structure or a multi quantum well structure formed as an<br>
InGaN well layer/InGaN barrier layer.   An example of the stack structure<br>
will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 3 later on.<br>
A p-GaN layer 14 is then formed on the active layer 12.   At this time,<br>
the  p-GaN  layer   14  may  be  formed  so  that  it  may  be  doped  with<br>
magnesium.<br>
A n-type second electrode layer is then formed on the p-GaN layer 14.<br>
In this case, an n-AllnN layer 16 may be adopted as the n-type second<br>
electrode layer.    At this time, the n-AllnN layer 16 may be formed so<br>
that it may be doped with silicon.<br>
In   the   nitride   semiconductor   light-emitting   device   according   to   the<br>
present   invention,   the   Si-In_ co-doped   GaN   layer   8   (i.e.,   the   first<br>
electrode layer) and the n-AllnN layer 16 (i.e., the second electrode<br>
layer) are all formed using n-type nitride and the p-GaN layer 14 is<br>
formed between the Si-In co-doped GaN layer 8 and the n-AllnN layer<br>
16.     In   view   of   the   above,   it  can   be   considered   that   the   nitride<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device according to the present invention<br>
has an n/p/n junction light-emitting device structure unlike the related art<br>
p/n junction light-emitting device.<br>
As described above, the present invention can provide a scheme in which<br>
a tow carrier concentration generating due to the structure of the related<br>
art p/n junction light-emitting device and low Mg doping efficiency of the<br>
p-GaN  nitride  semiconductor  itself,  and  a  current  crowding  problem<br>
depending   on   an   increase   of  contact  resistance   accordingly   can   be<br>
8<br><br>
overcome.<br>
More particularly, by forming the n-AllnN nitride semiconductor on an upper side, transparent conductive oxide such as ITO having optical transmittance of 95% higher can be used as a transparent electrode. That is, the transparent electrode for applying a bias voltage to an n-AllnN layer may include a transparent resistive material or transparent conductive .oxide, which can maximize current spreading so as to maximize the optical output and has a good optical transmittance. ITO, ZnO, RuOx, IrOx, NiO, or Au alloy metal including Ni may be used as such a material. It is thus possible to implement the optical output of 50% or higher compared to the related art p/n junction through'the use of the transparent electrode.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can lower an operating voltage owing to low contact resistance and can improve the reliability of devices accordingly. More particularly, a high output light-emitting device using a flip chip method necessarily requires a low operating voltage when being applied with the current of a targe area 300mA or higher. If contact resistance of the light-emitting device itself is relatively high so as to apply the same current, the operating voltage is increased. Accordingly, heat of 100"C or higher is generated in the light-emitting device itself. Heat generated internally has a decisive influence on the reliability.<br>
According to the n/p/n junction light-emitting device in accordance with the present invention, when the same current is applied due to low contact resistance, the device can be driven a relatively low operating voltage and heat generating within the device is low. Therefore, a light-emitting device with high reliability can be provided. Meanwhile, FIG. 2 is a view schematically showing the stack structure of a   nitride   semiconductor   light-emitting  device   according   to   a   second<br>
9<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The stack structure of the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 21 according to a second embodiment of the present invention shows a case where a super grading n-InxGai.xN layer 24 whose energy bandgap is controlled by sequentially changing the indium composition is further formed On the n-AlInN layer 16, when compared with the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 1 shown in FIG. 1. At this time, the super grading n-InxGa1-xN layer 24 can be formed to have the composition of 0<x at this time the super grading n-inxga1-xn layer may be doped with silicon.></x>
A nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 21 having this stack structure can be considered as an n/n/p/n junction light-emitting device. Further, in the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 21 having this stack structure, a transparent electrode for applying a bias voltage can be formed in the super grading n-InxGa1-xN layer 24.<br>
Furthermore, though not shown in the drawing, an InGaN/AlInGaN superlattice structure layer or an InGaN/InGaN superlattice structure layer can be formed on the n-AllnN layer 16 instead of the super grading n-InxGa1_xN layer 24. In this case, the InGaN/AlInGaN superlattice structure layer or the InGaN/InGaN superlattice structure layer may be doped with silicon. The structure of an active layer adopted in a nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 31 according to the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a view schematically showing the stack structure of a nitride semiconductor light-emitting device according to a third embodiment of the present invention.

In the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 31 according to a third embodiment of the present invention, a low-mole InxGai-xN layer 10 having a low content of indium that controls the strain of the active layer is formed in order to increase internal quantum efficiency, as shown in FIG. 3. Furthermore, in order to improve the optica! output and reverse leakage current due to indium fluctuation, SiNx cluster layers 33, 35, which are controlled in atomic scale form, are further formed on top and bottom surfaces of the low-mole InxGai-xN layer 10, respectively. Furthermore, the active layer that emits light can have a single quantum well structure or a multiple quantum well structure formed of an InyGai-yN well layer/InzGai-zN barrier layer.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an example of the light-emitting device having a multiple quantum well structure in which SiNx cluster layers 39, 45 are further provided between InyGai-yN well layers 37, 43 and InzGai-zN barrier layers 41, 47 as the active layers. In this case, in order to improve light-emitting efficiency of the active layer, the composition ratio can be controlled to InyGai-yN well layer (0<y cluster layer barrier further when considering the relation with low-mole inxgai-xn having a low content of indium doped into inygai-yn well layers inzgai-zn and can be controlled to have values respectively. furthermore though not shown in drawing gan cap that controls amount fluctuation formed between which form active lay-ers. at this time contents emit light constructed using></y>

Furthermore, after the last layer of the active layer, which has a single quantum well structure or a multiple quantum well structure, is grown, a SiNx cluster layer 140 is grown to a thickness of atomic scale, so that internal diffusion of the active layer within Mg atoms of the p-GaN layer 100 can be prohibited.<br>

The layers (the same reference numerals given), which have been described with reference io FIG. 1, of the stack structure shown in FIG. 4, will not be described. A nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 51 according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention further includes a super grading n-InxGa1-xN layer 52 whose energy bandgap is controlled by sequentially changing the indium composition is further formed on the p-GaN layer 14. Furthermore, FIG. 4 shows a case where an n-AUnN layer 54 is further formed on the super grading n-In.xGa1-xN layer 52.<br>
The nitride semiconductor light-emittins device 51 having; this stack structure can be interpreted as an n/n/p/n junction light-emitting device. Further, in the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 53 having this stack structure, a transparent electrode for applying a bias voltage may be formed in the n-AIInN layer 54.<br>
Meanwhile, although FIG. 4 shows a case where the super grading n-InxGa1-xN layer 52 is formed on the p-GaN layer 15, an InGaN/AlInGaN supperlattice structure layer or an InGaN/InGaN superlattice structure may be formed on the p-GaN layer 15 instead of the super grading n-InxGa1-xN layer 52.<br>

In this case, the p-AllnN layer 66 may be doped with magnesium.<br>
The nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 61 having this stack structure can be interpreted as a p/n junction light-emitting device, but can provide light-emitting efficiency similar to other embodiments by way of a physical characteristic of the p-AllnN layer 66. Further, in the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device 61 having this stack structure, a transparent electrode for applying a bias voltage may be formed in the p-AllnN layer 66.<br>
Further, FIG. 6 is a view schematically showing the stack structure of a nitride semiconductor light-emitting device according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>

At this time, the super grading n~InxGai-xN layer 74 may be formed to have the composition of 0<x at this time the super grading n-inxgai-xn layer may be doped with silicon.></x>

In this case, the buffer layer 84 may have an AlInN/GaN stack structure, an InGaN/GaN superlattice structure, an InxGa1-xN/GaN stack structure or the stack structure of ALJnyGa1-x+y)N/InxGa]_xN/GaN. Further, an In-doped GaN layer 86 into which indium is doped is formed on the buffer layer 84. A n-type first electrode layer is formed on the In-doped GaN layer 86. In this case, a Si-In co-doped GaN layer S8 into which silicon and indium are doped at the same time can be adopted as the n-type first electrode layer.<br>
Furthermore, an n-AlInN cladding layer 90 is formed on the Si-In co-doped GaN layer 88. An n-InGaN layer 92 is formed on the n-AlInN cladding layer 90. An active layer 94 that emits light is also formed on the n-InGaN layer 92. The active layer 94 may have a single quantum well structure or a multiple quantum well structure. An example of the stack structure constituting the active layer 94 will be described in more detail later on with reference io FIG. 9. In addition, according to the active layer 94 in accordance with the present invention, there is an advantage in  that sufficient optical efficiency can be accomplished even<br><br><br>
the active layer 94 has a single quantum well structure. Thereafter, a p-lnGaN layer 96 is formed on the active layer 94. A p-AllnN cladding layer 98 is formed on the p-InGaN layer 96. Furthermore, a p-GaN layer 100 is formed on the p-AllnN cladding layer 98. At this time, the p-GaN layer 100 may be doped with magnesium (Mg).<br>
In addition, an n-type second electrode layer is formed on the p-GaN layer 100. In this case, a super grading n-InxGai-xN layer 102 whose energy bandgap is controlled by sequentially changing the indium composition can be adopted as the n-type second electrode layer. At this time, the composition of the super grading n-InxGai-xN layer 102 can be controlled to 0<x further the super grading n-inxgai-xn layer may doped with silicon.></x>
As described above, in the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device according to the present invention, both the first electrode layer 88 and the second electrode layer 102 are formed using an n-type nitride semiconductor and the p-GaN layer 100 is formed therebetween. Therefore, in view of the above structure, it can be considered that the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device of the present invention has an npn junction light-emitting device structure unlike the related art pn junction light-emitting device.<br>
Furthermore, the n-type nitride semiconductor (e.g., the super grading n-InxGai-xN layer 102), which is used as the second electrode layer, has resistance lower than that of an existing p-GaN contact layer. Thus, contact resistance can be reduced and current implantation can be maximized. In addition, a transparent electrode for applying a bias voltage to the second electrode layer can include a transparent resistive material or transparent conductive oxide, which can maximize current dispersing so as to maximize the optical output and have a good optical<br>
15<br><br>
transmittance. ITO, ZnO, RuOx, IrOx, NiO, or Au alloy metal including Ni<br>
may be used as such a material.<br>
In this case, though not shown in the drawing, the second electrode layer<br>
may     have     an    InGaN/AlInGaN     superlattice    structure     layer    or     an<br>
InGaN/InGaN  supper  lattice  structure  layer.     Further,  the  InGaN/AIJnGaN<br>
superlattice    structure    layer    or    the    InGaN/InGaN    superlattice    structure<br>
layer may be doped with silicon.<br>
Furthermore, though not shown in the drawing,  an n-AIInN layer may  be<br>
used as the second electrode layer.<br>
According     to     the     nitride     semiconductor     light-emitting     device     SI<br>
constructed  above  in  accordance  with  the  present  invention,   the  n-AIInN<br>
cladding    layer   90   and    the   p-AlInN    cladding   layer   98    are    inserted<br>
lower/upper    side    to    the    active    layers    94,    respectively.        Therefore,<br>
internal    quantum    efficiency    can    be    improved    by    prohibiting    carrier<br>
implantation efficiency within the active layer 94 and current overflow.<br>
Further,  FIG.  8  is a view schematically showing the stack structure  of a<br>
nitride    semiconductor    light-emitting    device    according    to    an    eighth<br>
embodiment   of  the   present   invention.      The   layers   (the   same   reference<br>

eighth  embodiment  of the  present  invention   is  different  from   the  nitride<br>
semiconductor lisht-emitting device  81  shown  in FIG.  7  according  to  the<br>

InxGal-xN   layer   114   having  a  low   content  of  indium   is   further   formed<br>
between   the  n-InGaN  layer  92  and  the  active   layer  94.     The  reason   is<br><br>
that in order to increase internal quantum efficiency, the InxGai-xN layer<br>
114 having a low content of indium is further formed so that it can control<br>
the strain of the active layer 94.	- -<br>
