				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the epoxidation<br>
of olefins using a titanium containing zeolite catalyst whereby the<br>
deactivation of the catalyst upon recycling of the solvent has been<br>
considerably reduced.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
From EP-A 100 118 it is known that olefins can be converted with<br>
hydrogen peroxide to epoxides when a titanium containing zeolite is used<br>
as catalyst. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a<br>
polar solvent which dissolves both the olefin and the hydrogen peroxide<br>
in the reaction mixture. Methanol is preferably used as solvent.<br>
Nitrogen containing compounds are frequently introduced into the process<br>
as components of the starting materials, as additives to the epoxidation<br>
reaction or as additives or auxiliaries during the work-up of the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
Nitrogen containing compounds may be introduced with the hydrogen<br>
peroxide used. Commercial hydrogen peroxide solutions often contain<br>
nitrogen containing compounds as peroxide stabilizers or as corrosion<br>
inhibitors. One example is Aminotrimethylenephosphonic acid used as a<br>
stabilizer.<br>
Nitrogen containing compounds can be added to the epoxidation reaction<br>
to improve the propylene oxide selectivity. A large range of nitrogen<br>
containing compounds has been described for this purpose: Ammonia,<br>
ammonium salts and nitrates in EP-A 230 949 and EP-A 712 852, organic<br>
nitrogen bases such as amines in EP-A 1 072 599 and WO 00/17178, amine<br>
oxides in WO 00/17178, carboxylic acid amides in EP-A 940 393 and<br><br>
WO 01/92242 and nitriles in WO 01/68623. In a similar fashion, nitrogen<br>
containing chelating agents have been added to the epoxidation mixture<br>
to suppress the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as described in<br>
EP-A 757 045.<br>
An example for introducing a nitrogen containing compound during the<br>
work-up of the epoxidation mixture is disclosed in WO 99/14208 where<br>
nitrobenzene is described as the solvent for the extraction of the<br>
olefin oxide from the reaction mixture.<br>
When the epoxidation process is performed on an industrial scale the<br>
polar solvent used in the epoxidation reaction has to be recovered in<br>
the work-up of the reaction mixture and recycled to the epoxidation<br>
reaction for economic reasons. Processes for the recovery of the solvent<br>
have been described in WO 99/07690, WO 99/08985, WO 99/11639,<br>
WO 02/02544, WO 02/02545, WO 02/14298. WO 02/00635, WO 99/14208,<br>
WO 99/23052. WO 02/00634, US 5.599.955. WO 01/57009 and WO 01/57010.<br>
When the solvent is recycled, impurities contained in the recycled<br>
solvent may accumulate in the recycle up to undesirable levels. This<br>
problem has been addressed for the impurity acetaldehyde in WO 99/07690<br>
and WO 99/08985 and for methyl formate in WO 02/02544 and WO 02/02545.<br>
The recycled solvent may also contain impurities poisoning the<br>
epoxidation catalyst which leads to lower catalytic activity and a more<br>
rapid deactivation of the epoxidation catalyst when the recycled solvent<br>
is used in the epoxidation reaction. The inventors have observed such a<br>
catalyst poisoning when one or several nitrogen containing compounds<br>
were introduced at some stage of the oxidation process. The known<br>
methods for recovering and recycling the solvent have not addressed the<br>
problem of catalysts poisoning and offer no solution to this problem.<br><br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to improve a process<br>
for the catalytic epoxidation of olefins in the presence of a titanium<br>
containing zeolite catalyst wherein one or more nitrogen containing<br>
compounds are introduced at some stage of the process to achieve an<br>
improved activity of the epoxidation catalyst when solvent is recovered<br>
and recycled to the epoxidation stage.<br>
Subject matter of the invention<br>
This object has been attained by a process for the catalytic epoxidation<br>
of olefins, wherein one or more nitrogen containing compounds are<br>
introduced at some stage of the process, by<br>
i) reacting an olefin with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of<br>
a titanium containing zeolite catalyst and a polar solvent,<br>
ii) recovering a stream comprising the polar solvent from the<br>
reaction product of step i),<br>
iii) treating the stream recovered in step ii) to contain less<br>
than 50 wppm nitrogen in the form of organic nitrogen<br>
compounds and<br>
iv) recycling at least part of the treated stream of step iii)<br>
to the epoxidation step i).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process the treatment in step iii) is<br>
an acid treatment.<br>
The object is furthermore achieved by a process for the catalytic<br>
epoxidation of propene, wherein one or more nitrogen containing<br>
compounds are introduced at some stage of the process and<br>
a) in a reaction step propene is reacted with hydrogen peroxide in<br>
the presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst and a solvent<br>
comprising methanol,<br><br>
b)	the product stream from the reaction step is optionally passed to<br>
a pressure release step,<br>
c)	the product stream is then separated in a pre-evaporator having<br>
less than 10 theoretical separation stages into an overhead<br>
product containing propene, propene oxide and methanol, and into<br>
a bottom product containing methanol and water, 20 to 60% of the<br>
total amount of methanol introduced with the product stream being<br>
removed with the overhead product and the residue remaining in<br>
the bottom product,<br>
d)	at least a part of the bottom product from step c) is treated to<br>
contain less than 50 wppm nitrogen in the form of organic<br>
nitrogen compounds and, optionally after partially removing<br>
water,<br>
e)	at least a part of the treated product from step d) is recycled<br>
to the reaction step a).<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
In the process for the catalytic epoxidation of olefins according to the<br>
invention one or more nitrogen containing compounds are introduced at<br>
some stage of the process. If several nitrogen containing compounds are<br>
introduced they may be introduced either at the same stage or at<br>
different stages of the process. Introduction of the nitrogen containing<br>
compounds may be both on purpose or unintentionally.<br>
An unintentional introduction of one or more nitrogen containing<br>
compounds occurs if at least one of the starting materials olefin and<br>
hydrogen peroxide or the polar solvent used in the epoxidation reaction<br>
contains a nitrogen containing compound. One example is the use of a<br>
commercial hydrogen peroxide containing a nitrogen containing compound<br>
as an additive. Such additives are for example aminophosphonic acids<br><br>
used as peroxide stabilizers or nitrate salts used as corrosion<br>
inhibitors.<br>
Nitrogen containing compounds may also be introduced to the process for<br>
a certain purpose. Additives, such as ammonia, amines, amine oxides,<br>
carboxamides or nitriles may be introduced into the epoxidation reaction<br>
to improve epoxide selectivity. Nitrogen containing chelating compounds<br>
may be introduced at the same stage to reduce peroxide decomposition.<br>
Nitrogen containing compounds may also be introduced during the work-up<br>
of the reaction mixture as solvents for example in extraction steps or<br>
extractive distillations. Nitrogen containing compounds containing an<br>
unsubstituted NH2 group, preferably hydrazine, can be used during work-up<br>
to convert carbonyl compounds to less volatile products.<br>
The nitrogen containing compounds introduced to the process may be<br>
converted to other nitrogen containing compounds by chemical reactions<br>
within the process. Such a reaction can be the oxidation with hydrogen<br>
peroxide both uncatalysed or catalysed by the titanium containing<br>
zeolite. Ammonia may be oxidized to hydroxylamine. nitrite or nitrate.<br>
Primary amines may be oxidized to substituted hydroxylamines, oximes or<br>
nitroalkanes. Secondary amines may be oxidized to substituted<br>
hydroxylamines. Tertiary amines may be oxidized to amine oxides. Ammonia<br>
or primary amines may also react with epoxides to give ami no alcohols<br>
which in turn can be further oxidized. Hydroxylamine may react with<br>
carbonyl compounds formed in side reactions from the epoxide to give<br>
oximes. In a similar way hydrazine will react with carbonyl compounds to<br>
give hydrazones and azines. If the work-up of the reaction mixture<br>
contains a hydrogenation stage, oximes, hydrazones and azines will be<br>
converted to primary amines.<br>
From the above it is evident that a stream comprising the polar solvent<br>
recovered from the epoxidation reaction mixture may contain a wide range<br><br>
of organic nitrogen compounds even if only inorganic nitrogen containing<br>
compounds are introduced into the process. Due to the large number of<br>
reactions and the complex network of reactions it is not possible to<br>
predict per se which organic nitrogen compounds will be present and in<br>
what amount.<br>
The inventors have observed that surprisingly the recycling of the<br>
recovered polar solvent to the epoxidation step leads to a reduced<br>
activity of the epoxidation catalyst and a more rapid catalyst<br>
deactivation when one or more nitrogen containing compounds are<br>
introduced at some stage of the epoxidation process with a titanium<br>
containing zeolite catalyst.<br>
It has now been found that the activity of the epoxidation catalyst can<br>
be increased and the catalyst deactivation can be reduced by treating<br>
the recovered stream comprising the polar solvent to contain less than<br>
50 wppm nitrogen in the form organic nitrogen compounds before recycling<br>
it to the epoxidation step (wppm = weight parts per million = mg/kg).<br>
Preferably, the recovered stream is treated to contain less than<br>
30 wppm, more preferably less than 15 wppm and most preferably less than<br>
10 wppm nitrogen in the form organic nitrogen compounds.<br>
Organic nitrogen compounds are understood as being compounds that<br>
contain a covalent bond between a carbon and a nitrogen atom. The amount<br>
of nitrogen in the form of organic nitrogen compounds is preferably<br>
determined as the difference between the total amount of nitrogen and<br>
the amount of nitrogen in the form of inorganic nitrogen compounds. The<br>
total amount of nitrogen is preferably determined by the Kjeldahl method<br>
as described in DIN 53625. The amount of nitrogen in the form of<br>
inorganic nitrogen compounds is preferably determined by ion<br>
chromatography detecting the individual inorganic nitrogen compounds.<br>
When the recovered solvent stream has been subjected to a destination<br><br>
step before recycling it to the epoxidation stage it will usually<br>
contain no inorganic compounds other than ammonia. Therefore it will be<br>
sufficient for practical purposes to determine the amount of nitrogen in<br>
the form inorganic nitrogen compounds by determination of ammonium,<br>
either as such or in the form of ammonium salts.<br>
For the purpose of the invention the determination of nitrogen in the<br>
form of organic nitrogen compounds can be performed both continuously or<br>
discontinuously. When the determination is done at intervals, these can<br>
be both periodical intervals or irregular intervals. Usually it will be<br>
sufficient to determine the amount of nitrogen in the form of organic<br>
nitrogen compounds only when process parameters have changed.<br>
The treatment of the recovered stream to contain less than 50 wppm<br>
nitrogen in the form of organic nitrogen compounds may comprise of<br>
separation steps or chemical reactions. The treatment may also combine<br>
several separation steps or may combine separation steps with one or<br>
more chemical reactions. Suitable separation steps for the treatment are<br>
for example distillation, crystallization, extraction, absorption or<br>
membrane separations. Suitable chemical reactions for the treatment are<br>
acid base reactions, selective oxidation of organic nitrogen compounds<br>
or selective reduction of organic nitrogen compounds. Preferably the<br>
treatment comprises an acid treatment of the recovered solvent stream.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process the treatment of the recovered<br>
stream is by an acid treatment comprising adding an acid to the<br>
recovered stream and subjecting the obtained mixture to a distillation<br>
step. In the distillation step a distillate is withdrawn comprising the<br>
polar solvent and containing less than 50 wppm nitrogen in the form of<br>
organic nitrogen compounds.<br><br>
In another preferred, embodiment of the process the treatment of the<br>
recovered stream is an acid treatment comprising subjecting the<br>
recovered stream to a continuously operated distillation and feeding a<br>
stream comprising an acid at a point above the feed point of the<br>
recovered stream to the distillation column. A product stream comprising<br>
the polar solvent and containing less than 50 wppm nitrogen in the form<br>
of organic nitrogen compounds is withdrawn from the distillation column<br>
at a point above the feed point of the acid comprising stream,<br>
preferably at the top of the column.<br>
The acid treatment of the recovered stream may be affected by any<br>
suitable acid such as a mineral acid, a carboxylic acid or an acidic ion<br>
exchanger in its protonated form. Suitable mineral acids are nitric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid or perchloric<br>
acid. Preferred mineral acids are sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid.<br>
Carboxylic acids are preferably selected from C1 to C12 mono or<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid,<br>
butyric acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic<br>
acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid or dodecanoic acid,<br>
oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid,<br>
maleic acid or fumaric acid. The most preferred carboxylic acid is<br>
acetic acid.<br>
For the acid treatment with an acidic ion exchanger in its protonated<br>
form, both strongly acidic ion exchangers and weakly acidic ion<br>
exchangers can be used. Preferred are strongly acidic ion exchangers<br>
containing SO3H groups and weakly acidic ion exchangers containing COOH<br>
groups. The acidic ion exchanger is preferably based on an organic<br>
polymer, such as crosslinked polystyrene, or an organic inorganic hybrid<br>
polymer, such as a polysiloxane. The acidic ion exchanger may be either<br>
a liquid, a gel type solid or a macroporous solid. In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment the treatment is effected by passing the recovered solvent<br>
stream through a fixed bed containing the acidic ion exchanger.<br>
Using the process according to the invention any olefin can be<br>
epoxidized, in particular olefins with 2 to 6 carbon atoms. The process<br>
according to the invention is most particularly suitable for the<br>
epoxidation of propene to propene oxide. For economic reasons it would<br>
be preferred for an industrial scale process to use propene not in a<br>
pure form but as a technical mixture with propane that as a rule<br>
contains 1 to 15 vol.% of propane. The olefin may be fed as a liquid as<br>
well as in gaseous form into the reaction system.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is preferably used as an aqueous solution containing<br>
1 to 90 % by weight, preferably 10 to 70 % by weight of hydrogen<br>
peroxide. A hydrogen peroxide crude product obtained from the extraction<br>
step of the anthraquinone process and containing 30 to 45 % by weight of<br>
hydrogen peroxide is most preferably used. Alternatively, hydrogen<br>
peroxide solutions in alcohols, preferably in methanol can be used.<br>
These alcoholic solutions can be prepared by reaction of hydrogen and<br>
oxygen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst and the alcohol.<br>
Crystalline, titanium-containing zeolites, preferably those of the<br>
composition (Ti02)x(Si02)1.x where x is from 0.001 to 0.05 and having a MFI<br>
or MEL crystalline structure, known as titanium silica!ite-1 and<br>
titanium silicalite-2, are suitable as catalysts for the epoxidation<br>
process according to the invention. Such catalysts may be produced for<br>
example according to the process described in US-A 4,410,501. The<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst may be employed as a shaped catalyst in the<br>
form of granules, extrudates or shaped bodies. For the forming process<br>
the catalyst may contain 1 to 99* of a binder or carrier material, all<br>
binders and carrier materials being suitable that do not react with<br>
hydrogen peroxide or with the epoxide under the reaction conditions<br><br>
employed for the epoxidation. Extrudates with a diameter of 1 to 5 mm<br>
are preferably used as fixed bed catalysts.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a polar solvent in order<br>
to increase the solubility of the olefin, preferably propene, in the<br>
liquid phase. Suitable as solvent are all polar solvents that are not<br>
oxidised or are oxidised only to a slight extent by hydrogen peroxide<br>
under the chosen reaction conditions, and that dissolve in an amount of<br>
more than 10 wt.% in water. Preferred are solvents that are completely<br>
miscible with water. Suitable solvents include alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol or tert.-butanol; glycols such as for example ethylene<br>
glycol, 1,2-propanediol or 1,3-propanediol; cyclic ethers such as for<br>
example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or propylene oxide; glycol ethers such<br>
as for example ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether or propylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, and ketones such as for example acetone or 2-butanone.<br>
Alcohols are preferred as solvents, methanol is particularly preferred.<br>
The olefin, the hydrogen peroxide solution and the polar solvent may be<br>
introduced into the reactor as independent feeds or one or more of these<br>
feeds may be mixed prior to introduction into the reactor. The olefin is<br>
preferably employed in excess relative to the hydrogen peroxide in order<br>
to achieve a significant consumption of hydrogen peroxide, the molar<br>
ratio of olefin, preferably propene, to hydrogen peroxide preferably<br>
being chosen in the range from 1.1 to 30. The solvent is preferably<br>
added in a weight ratio of 0.5 to 20 relative to the amount of hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution used. The amount of catalyst employed may be varied<br>
within wide limits and is preferably chosen so that a hydrogen peroxide<br>
consumption of more than 90%. preferably more than 95%, is achieved<br>
within 1 minute to 5 hours under the employed reaction conditions.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention the titanium silicalite catalyst is<br>
suspended in the reaction mixture during the reaction. The catalyst is<br>
then used in the form of a powder or in the form of a suspendable<br>
granular material that has been produced by forming in a manner known<br>
per se, for example by spray drying or fluidised bed granulation. When<br>
using a suspended catalyst, mixing reactors, for example stirred tank<br>
reactors or recycle reactors, as well as non-mixing flow reactors, for<br>
example tubular flow reactors, may be used for the reaction. A cascade<br>
consisting of one to three mixing reactors and a non-mixing flow reactor<br>
connected downstream is preferably used.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the titanium silicalite catalyst<br>
is used as a fixed bed over which a mixture of the feedstock materials<br>
is passed. The catalyst is then used in the form of shaped bodies that<br>
have been produced in a manner known per se, for example by extrusion<br>
with the addition of binders.<br>
When using a fixed bed catalyst, reactors with bubble column<br>
characteristics can be used, i.e. the reactor contains a continuous<br>
liquid phase and a dispersed gaseous phase flows through the reactor in<br>
up-flow mode. Alternatively, reactors with trickle bed characteristics<br>
can be used, i.e. the reactor contains a gas phase and a liquid phase<br>
flows through the reactor in down-flow mode.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the<br>
process is conducted in a fixed bed reactor and the following flow<br>
conditions are selected to maintain the catalyst bed in a trickle bed<br>
state:<br><br>
wherei n<br><br>
G is the gaseous superficial velocity defined as the gaseous flow rate<br>
in m3/h in the continuous flow reactor divided by the cross-section of<br>
the catalyst bed in m2,<br>
L is the liquid superficial velocity defined as the liquid flow rate in<br>
m3/h in the continuous flow reactor divided by the cross-section of the<br>
catalyst bed in m2,<br><br>
pG is the density of the gaseous phase in g/cm3,<br>
pL is the density of the liquid phase in g/cm3,<br>
pw is the density of water in g/cm3,<br>
pA1r is the density of air in g/cm3,<br>
aw is the surface tension of water in dyn/cm,<br>
  is the surface tension of the liquid phase in dyn/cm,<br>
  is the viscosity of the liquid phase in centipoise,<br>
  is the viscosity of water in centipoise.<br>
The epoxidation reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures<br>
between 0 and 80°C, more preferably between 40 and 65°C. According to a<br>
most preferred embodiment of the present invention the epoxidation<br>
reaction is carried out in a fixed bed reactor equipped with cooling<br>
means and the temperature profile within the reactor is maintained such<br>
that the cooling medium temperature of the cooling means is at least<br>
30°C and the maximum temperature within the catalyst bed is 60°C at the<br>
most, preferably 55°C.<br>
The epoxidation reaction can be carried out at ambient or at elevated<br>
pressure depending on the olefin to be epoxidized. If the boiling point<br><br>
of the olefin is below the temperature chosen for the epoxidation<br>
reaction, the pressure is usually maintained at 5 to 50 bar, preferably<br>
15 to 30 bar.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the conditions for the<br>
epoxidation reaction, that is temperature, pressure and the amounts of<br>
olefin, hydrogen peroxide and solvent, are chosen to obtain a multiphase<br>
reaction mixture comprising a liquid aqueous hydrogen peroxide rich<br>
phase containing the polar solvent and a liquid organic olefin rich<br>
phase. To ensure the formation of a second liquid organic olefin rich<br>
phase the amount of olefin has to be selected in excess of the amount<br>
soluble in the aqueous phase comprising water, hydrogen peroxide and<br>
solvent at the chosen temperature and pressure. Maintaining two<br>
immiscible liquid phases during the epoxidation reaction leads to<br>
improved epoxide selectivity.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention ammonia is added to the<br>
epoxidation stage to improve the epoxide selectivity in an amount of 100<br>
to 3000 ppm, preferably 300 to 2000 ppm based on the weight of hydrogen<br>
peroxide.<br>
The recovery of the polar solvent from the epoxidation reaction mixture<br>
may be performed by any suitable separation method or combination of<br>
separation methods, such as distillation, crystallization, extraction,<br>
adsorption or the like. Preferably, a combination of distillation steps<br>
is used for the recovery. Preferably, unreacted olefin and the epoxide<br>
product are separated from the solvent stream during the recovery<br>
process. Some of the water contained in the solvent stream may be<br>
separated as well during the solvent recovery. The recovered solvent<br>
stream, that is treated to contain less than 50 wppm nitrogen in the<br>
form of organic compounds, may comprise further components, such as<br><br>
water, unreacted hydrogen peroxide or byproducts from the epoxidation<br>
process.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is directed towards an improved<br>
process for the catalytic epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide<br>
in the presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst and a solvent<br>
comprising methanol. The improved process integrates the inventive<br>
treatment and recycle of the solvent into the workup of the reaction<br>
mixture to provide propene oxide with a minimum of separation steps and<br>
a low energy requirement while at the same time maintaining high<br>
catalytic activity and a long catalyst lifetime.<br>
Epoxidation of propene is carried out as described above using a solvent<br>
comprising methanol.<br>
Before the working up stage the pressure of the propene epoxidation<br>
reaction mixture is preferably released in a pressure release stage to<br>
the pressure employed in the working up of the propene oxide. Part of<br>
the propene dissolved in the reaction mixture and possibly propane is<br>
gassed out. The resultant gas is recompressed via a compressor to the<br>
pressure prevailing in the reactor and is returned to the reaction.<br>
The reaction mixture is then separated in a pre-evaporator into an<br>
overhead product containing propene, possibly propane, propene oxide and<br>
methanol, and into a bottom product containing methanol, water, higher<br>
boiling point byproducts, such as for example propylene glycol,<br>
unreacted hydrogen peroxide and possibly suspended titanium silicalite<br>
catalyst. The pre-evaporator according to the invention has lass than<br>
20, preferably at most 10 theoretical separation steps and is preferably<br>
designed so that the rectification section corresponds to a single<br>
distillation stage and the remaining separation effect is achieved in<br>
the stripping section. The pre-evaporator is operated at a reflux ratio<br><br>
of at most 1.5 and if desired may also be operated totally without<br>
reflux. The pressure in the pre-evaporator is preferably chosen in the<br>
range from 1.5 to less than 3 bar in order to avoid decomposition of<br>
hydrogen peroxide. The pre-evaporator is operated so that between 20 and<br>
60% of the amount of solvent fed in with the reaction mixture is removed<br>
with the overhead product and the balance remains in the bottom product.<br>
Preferably, more than 95%, more preferably, more than 98% and most<br>
preferably, more than 99% of the propene oxide fed in is contained in<br>
the overhead product, and preferably, more than 90%. more preferably,<br>
more than 97% of the water fed in is contained in the bottom product.<br>
The product stream fed to the pre-evaporator preferably contains 0.5 to<br>
20 % by weight of propene, 0 to 4 % by weight of propane, 5 to 35 % by<br>
weight of propene oxide, 35 to 80 % by weight of methanol, 5 to 40 % by<br>
weight of water, 0.1 to 8 % by weight of higher boiling point<br>
byproducts, 0.1 to 5 % by weight hydrogen peroxide and 0 to 5 % by<br>
weight of titanium silicalite catalyst. This product stream is<br>
preferably separated in the pre-evaporator into an overhead product<br>
containing 1 to 40 % by weight of propene, 0 to 10 % by weight of<br>
propane, 15 to 75 % by weight of propene oxide, 20 to 85 % by weight of<br>
methanol and 0 to 5 % by weight of water, and into a bottom product<br>
containing 0 to 2 % by weight of propene oxide, 30 to 80 % by weight of<br>
methanol, 15 to 65 % by weight of water, 0.1 to 10 % by weight of higher<br>
boiling point byproducts, 0.1 to 5 % by weight of hydrogen peroxide, 0<br>
to 10 % by weight of titanium silicalite catalyst and more than 50 wppm<br>
nitrogen in the form of organic nitrogen compounds.<br>
At least a part and preferably all of the bottom product of the pre-<br>
evaporator comprising methanol and water is treated to contain less than<br>
50 wppm nitrogen in the form of organic nitrogen compounds. At least a<br>
part and preferably all of the resulting treated product is then<br>
recycled to the epoxidation reaction. Preferably at least a part of the<br><br><br>
water contained in the bottom product of the pre-evaporator is removed<br>
before the recycle stream is fed to the epoxidation stage. Removal of<br>
water may be performed before the treatment, after the treatment or<br>
combined with the treatment into a single process stage.<br>
The treatment of the recovered methanol to contain less than 50 wppm<br>
nitrogen in the form of organic nitrogen compounds may be performed by<br>
all methods described above as suitable for the treatment of a recovered<br>
polar solvent stream. Preferably the treatment comprises an acid<br>
treatment of the recovered methanol stream. Most preferably, the same<br>
embodiments of the acid treatment are employed as described above as<br>
preferred embodiments for the acid treatment of the solvent stream.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the propene epoxidation process the<br>
overhead product from the pre-evaporator is at least partially condensed<br>
to give a condensate containing 0 to 12 % by weight of propene, 0 to 5 %<br>
by weight of propane, 15 to 75 % by weight of propene oxide, 20 to 85 %<br>
by weight of methanol and 0 to 8 % by weight of water. Preferably the<br>
overhead product is only partially condensed and the uncondensed<br>
propene, possibly mixed with propane, is recompressed via a compressor<br>
to the pressure prevailing in the reaction part and is recycled to the<br>
reaction. The propene still dissolved in the condensate and possibly<br>
propane are preferably stripped out from the condensate in a<br>
C3 stripper. Preferably the stripped-out gas is recycled to the partial<br>
condenser. Preferably the partial condensation is performed in two<br>
steps. The overhead product from the pre-evaporator is partially<br>
condensed in a first condenser and the gaseous effluent from the first<br>
condenser is condensed in a second condenser maintained at a temperature<br>
below the temperature of the first condenser. Preferably the temperature<br>
within the first condenser is maintained at 40 to 70°C and the<br>
temperature within the second condenser is maintained at 20 to 35°C. By<br>
using a two step condensation the amount of valuable propene oxide that<br><br>
can not be recovered is considerably reduced and the energy consumption<br>
for cooling is reduced compared to a one step condensation. When<br>
applying the two step condensation the condensates of both condensers<br>
are passed to the C3 stripper to remove constituents having a boiling<br>
point that is lower than that of propene oxide, whereby the gaseous<br>
effluent from the stripper is partially condensed in the second<br>
condenser and the condensate is recycled to the C3 stripper.<br>
The condensate, obtained by at least partially condensing the overhead<br>
product from the pre-evaporator and optionally stripping it in a<br>
C3 stripper is then subjected to an extractive distillation with an<br>
aqueous extraction solvent. The condensate is fed to the middle section<br>
of a continuously operated distillation column. The aqueous extraction<br>
solvent is added to the extractive distillation column at a point above<br>
the point at which the condensate enters the column. A purified propene<br>
oxide is withdrawn at the top of the column. At the bottom of the<br>
extractive distillation column a bottom product containing methanol and<br>
water is obtained. This bottom product is combined with the bottom<br>
product from the pre-evaporator and the combined product is subjected to<br>
the treatment to remove organic nitrogen compounds.<br>
The extraction solvent is preferably an aqueous hydrazine solution<br>
containing from 0.5 to 5 % by weight hydrazine. When an aqueous<br>
hydrazine solution is used as the extraction solvent, the extractive<br>
distillation not only removes methanol but also acetaldehyde and other<br>
carbonyl compounds from the propene oxide and provides a purified<br>
propene oxide containing less than 50 ppm methanol and less than 50 ppm<br>
acetaldehyde in a single purification step.<br>
The amount of the extraction solvent fed to the extractive distillation<br>
column is preferably chosen so that the mass ratio of the extraction<br>
solvent feed relative to the amount of methanol contained in the pre-<br><br>
evaporator condensate is in the range from 0.1 to 10. The extractive<br>
distillation is preferably operated at an absolute pressure from 1 to<br>
5 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure from 1.5 to 2.5 bar. The<br>
reflux ratio is preferably chosen in the range from 1 to 5.<br>
The distillation column used for the extractive distillation comprises a<br>
stripping section between the column bottoms and the feed point of the<br>
pre-evaporator condensate, an extraction section between the feed point<br>
of pre-evaporator condensate and the feed point of the extraction<br>
solvent and a rectifying section between the feed point of the<br>
extraction solvent and the point where the purified propene oxide is<br>
withdrawn. Preferably a distillation column is used that has a<br>
separation efficiency of 10 to 30 theoretical stages in both the<br>
stripping section and the extraction section and a separation efficiency<br>
of 20 to 60 theoretical stages in the rectifying section. The<br>
distillation column can be a tray column containing discrete trays such<br>
as sieve trays or bubble cap trays. The distillation column can also be<br>
a packed column and both random packings as well as structured packings,<br>
such as metal gauze packings can be used. The distillation column may<br>
also combine sections with discrete trays and sections with packings.<br>
The extraction section is preferably designed with discrete trays.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the epoxidation process the bottom product<br>
from the pre-evaporator or the combined bottom products from the pre-<br>
evaporator and the extractive distillation are subjected to a catalytic<br>
hydrogenation step before being subjected to the treatment to remove<br>
organic nitrogen compounds. The additional hydrogenation step reduces<br>
the accumulation of byproducts, such as methyl formate and<br>
dimethoxymethane, in the solvent recycle and improves the purity of the<br>
propene oxide recovered with the process.<br><br>
The catalytic hydrogenation is preferably carried out as a heterogeneous<br>
catalytic hydrogenation at a hydrogen partial pressure of 0.5 to 30 MPa.<br>
It is particularly preferred to conduct the hydrogenation step at a<br>
temperature in the range of 80°C and 150°C, preferably 100°C to 180°C<br>
and at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1 to 25 MPa.<br>
Suitable hydrogenation catalysts are selected from supported catalysts<br>
comprising one or more of metals selected from the group consisting of<br>
Ru, Rh, Pd. Pt, Ag, Ir, Fe, Cu, Ni and Co. Alternatively Raney Nickel<br>
and Raney Cobalt both optionally being doped with one or more of the<br>
above mentioned can be used. The catalyst support is preferably selected<br>
from activated carbon and metal oxides selected from SiO2, TiO2, ZrOz and<br>
A12O3, mixed oxides comprising at least two of Si, Al, Ti and Zr and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out continuously or batch-wise e.g., in<br>
a suspension method or a fixed-bed method. It is especially preferred<br>
to use a trickle-bed reactor. The fixed-bed catalysts to be used therein<br>
are preferably pellets with a diameter of 0.5 to 5 mm, especially 1 to<br>
3 mm and with a length of 1 to 10 mm. The noble-metal content is in the<br>
customary range, preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight.<br>
The advantages of the present invention will be apparent in view of the<br>
following examples.<br>
Examples.<br>
Example 1 (Comparative example)<br>
Epoxidation was carried out continuously in a tubular reactor of 300 ml<br>
volume filled with silica bonded titanium-silicalite extrudates with a<br><br>
diameter of 3 mm. The equipment was furthermore comprised of three<br>
containers for liquids and relevant pumps and a liquid separating<br>
vessel. The three containers for liquids comprised methanol, 60 wt-#<br>
aqueous H202 and propene. The 60% H202 was adjusted with ammonia to a pH<br>
of 4.5. The reaction temperature was controlled via an aqueous cooling<br>
liquid circulating in a cooling jacket whereby the cooling liquid<br>
temperature was controlled by a thermostat. The reactor pressure was<br>
25 bar absolute. Mass flow of the feeding pumps was adjusted to result<br>
in a propene feed concentration of 21.5 wt-%, a methanol feed<br>
concentration of 57 wt-% and an H202 feed concentration of 9.4 wt-%. The<br>
reactor was operated in down-flow operation mode. The cooling jacket<br>
temperature was 41°C, the total mass flow was 0.35 kg/h and the maximum<br>
temperature was 59°C. Product output was determined by gas<br>
chromatography and the H202 conversion by redox titration. The catalyst<br>
selectivity was calculated on the basis of gas chromatographical<br>
analysis of the propene oxygenates as the ratio of the amount of propene<br>
oxide formed relative to the amount of all propene oxygenates formed.<br>
Initial H202 conversion was 96% at a catalyst selectivity of 96%.<br>
The reaction mixture obtained from the reaction after release of<br>
pressure was separated in a pre-evaporation stage into an overhead<br>
product containing propene, propane, propene oxide and methanol, and a<br>
bottom product containing methanol, propylene glycol monomethyl ethers,<br>
propylene glycol, water, high boiling point compounds and non-converted<br>
hydrogen peroxide. A liquid condensate that contains propene oxide and<br>
methanol as well as propene and propane dissolved therein was obtained<br>
from the vapour state overhead product. The uncondensed stream, which<br>
substantially consisted of propene and propane, was returned to the<br>
epoxidation reaction. The propene and propane dissolved in the<br>
condensate were stripped from the latter in a C3 stripper and returned<br>
in the vapour state together with the pre-evaporator overhead stream to<br>
the partial condensation stage. The stripped condensate stream, which<br><br>
consisted substantially of propene oxide and methanol and had been freed<br>
from propene and propane, was separated in an extractive distillation in<br>
which a 1.5 wt-% aqueous solution of hydrazine was fed in as extraction<br>
agent immediately underneath the head of the column, into a propene<br>
oxide purified product and into a bottom product that consisted<br>
substantially of methanol and water. The bottom product was combined<br>
with the bottom product obtained in the pre-evaporator and subjected to<br>
hydrogenation in a trickle-bed reactor for continuous hydrogenation. The<br>
hydrogenation reactor had an interior volume of 150 ml and was filled<br>
with a hydrogenation catalyst in form of extrudates with 2.3 mm diameter<br>
comprising 2% Ru on activated carbon (The catalyst was prepared<br>
according to the incipient wetness method using RuCl3, "Preparation of<br>
Catalyst", Demon, B. et al., Elsevier, Amsterdam. 1976, page 13). The<br>
hydrogenation was performed at 140°C and 40 bar abs. at a hydrogen flow<br>
rate of 10 ml/h.<br>
The hydrogenated product was fed at a rate of 3.5 kg/h to the middle<br>
section of a methanol distillation column with 35 theoretical stages and<br>
was continuously distilled at a pressure of 2 bar abs. with a reflux<br>
ratio of 2. At the top of the column 2.5 kg/h of a methanol stream was<br>
obtained which contained more than 99 wt-% methanol, 0.13 wt-% water,<br>
55 wppm total nitrogen and less than 5 wppm nitrogen from ammonia. Total<br>
nitrogen content was determined by the Kjeldahl method of DIN 53625,<br>
ammonia nitrogen by ion chromatography. From the difference of total<br>
nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen the nitrogen content from organic nitrogen<br>
compounds was calculated as between 50 and 55 wppm.<br>
The recovered methanol was reused for the epoxidation of propene in a<br>
laboratory apparatus consisting of two tubular reactors in series with a<br>
diameter of 18 mm and a length of 300 mm each, each containing 8 g of<br>
the same catalyst as used in the first epoxidation. The catalyst had<br>
been previously conditioned by using it for propene epoxidation for more<br><br>
than 3000 h. The reactors were operated in up-flow mode at a pressure of<br>
25 bar abs. and a temperature of 36°C in the first reactor and 44°C in<br>
the second reactor. Three feed streams were simultaneously introduced<br>
into the reactor. Feed 1 was a mixture of 715 g 60 wt-% aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide and 1420 g fresh methanol, the methanol containing no<br>
detectable amounts of nitrogen compounds, and was introduced at a rate<br>
of 22.5 g/h. Feed 2 was a mixture of 1284 g recovered methanol and<br>
1.335 g 32 wt-% aqueous ammonia, introduced at a rate of 14.8 g/h.<br>
Feed 3 was propene, introduced at a rate of 23 g/h.<br>
The reactor effluents were analyzed for propylene oxide by gas<br>
chromatography and for hydrogen peroxide by redox titration. Propylene<br>
oxide yield was calculated on the amount of hydrogen peroxide fed. The<br>
results are shown in table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the variation, that a 10 wt-% solution of<br>
acetic acid in methanol was fed to the reflux stream of the methanol<br>
distillation column at a rate of 81 g/h. The methanol stream withdrawn<br>
at the top of the column contained more than 98 wt-% methanol, 1.6 wt-%<br>
water, 33 wppm total nitrogen and 7 wppm nitrogen from ammonia. From the<br>
difference of total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen the nitrogen content<br>
from organic nitrogen compounds was calculated as 26 wppm. Reuse of the<br>
recovered methanol for the epoxidation of propene as in example 1 gave<br>
the results shown in table 1.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the variation, that a 10 wt-% aqueous<br>
solution of acetic acid was fed to the reflux stream of the methanol<br>
distillation column at a rate of 98 g/h. The methanol stream withdrawn<br>
at the top of the column contained more than 97 wt-% methanol, 2 wt-%<br>
water, 14 wppm total nitrogen and less than 4 wppm nitrogen from<br>
ammonia. From the difference of total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen the<br>
nitrogen content from organic nitrogen compounds was calculated as<br>
between 10 and 14 wppm. Reuse of the recovered methanol for the<br>
epoxidation of propene as in example 1 gave the results shown in<br>
table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
Example 1 was repeated and a methanol stream containing more than<br>
97 wt-% methanol, 2.5 wt-% water and 110 wppm total nitrogen was<br>
withdrawn from the top of the methanol column. 1000 ml of this recovered<br>
methanol were treated with 10 ml Dowex 50X8 strongly acidic ion<br>
exchanger in the H+-form at room temparature for 3 days with occasional<br>
shaking. The treated methanol contained 1.9 wppm total nitrogen. This<br>
treated recovered methanol was reused for the epoxidation of propene as<br>
described in example 1 with the difference, that recovered methanol was<br>
used in feed 1 in place of fresh methanol. The results are shown in<br>
table l.<br><br><br>
In comparative example 1 poisoning of the catalyst by the recycled<br>
methanol leads to low hydrogen peroxide conversion and low propene oxide<br>
yield. The use of a recovered methanol with a low content of nitrogen in<br>
the form of organic compounds in examples 2 to 4 results in increased<br>
catalyst activity as can be seen by the increased hydrogen peroxide<br>
conversion and propene oxide yield.<br><br>
