				<td>Laser Honing Tool for Generating a Structure Formed by Micro-bags<br>
on a Tribologically Stressed Surface of a Work-Piece<br>
Description<br>
The invention pertains to a laser honing tool for generating a structure formed by micro-<br>
bags on a tribologically stressed surface of a work-piece.<br>
Such a surface could, for example, be the cylindrical contact surface of a bore in the<br>
engine block of a combustion engine. The micro-bags serve the purpose of a receiving<br>
lubricant, particularly in the region of the upper and lower dead centres of the piston of<br>
the combustion engine.<br>
Laser honing tools with agents for introducing, focusing and deflecting a laser beam are<br>
known (EP 0 565 724 B1; DE 43 16 012 C2; DE 295 06 005 U; EP 1 275 864 B1).<br>
It is the task of this invention, to further improve such laser honing tools.<br>
This task is fulfilled as per the invention with the help of agents as mentioned in claim 1.<br>
The invention further pertains to various advantageous extensions.<br>
Design example of the invention and their advantageous extensions are described in more<br>
details below on the basis of the enclosed drawings.<br>
The following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1 A design example;<br>
Fig.2 A second design example;<br>
Fig.3 A trimming and fine-honing tool used subsequent to the processing, with the<br>
design example as shown in figures 1 and 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows a work-piece 1 with a bore 2, which has a cylindrical inner surface 3.<br>
Micro-bags 6 are introduced into this inner surface 3 with the help of a laser beam; these<br>
micro-bags receive lubricants in case of a tribological stressing (stressing due to friction)<br>
of the inner surface 3, e.g. the cylindrical bore in the engine block of a combustion<br>
engine.<br>
The laser honing tool has a tool body 5, which is fixed with bolts 7 on to a flange 8 of the<br>
hollow spindle 10 of a honing machine that is open below. The spindle can be moved up<br>
and down and can also be rotated.<br>
The laser beam 15 is generated with known agents and introduced on top (not shown)<br>
into the hollow inner space 11 of the spindle 10. It then comes out of the opening 9 at the<br>
lower end of the spindle 10 and enters the inner space 16 of the tool body 5 and is<br>
focused by a focussing lens 17 in such a way, that after deflection by the deflecting<br>
mirror 18' of a deflecting mechanism 18 and on meeting the inner surface 3 of the work-<br>
piece 1 it forms the point P. If the spindle 10 is then rotated around its axis A by a certain<br>
angle, one obtains a micro-bag 6.<br>
The focussing lens 17 is situated in a sleeve 20 that is arranged in the tool body and can<br>
be axially shifted but not rotated. This is achieved, in that a pin 23 fixed to it is guided in<br>
a slit 22 running in axial direction. Focussing is done by rotating a setting ring 19, which<br>
is arranged on to the tool body 5, and can be rotated but not axially shifted. The setting<br>
ring 19 is provided on the inside with a rectangular, spiral-shaped groove 21 that runs at<br>
an inclination, like a thread against the axis A, into which the pin 23 grips in. As this is<br>
fixed to the sleeve 20, on rotating the setting ring 19 there results an axial shift of a pin 23<br>
and hence also of the sleeve 20 with the focussing lens 17 connected to it.<br>
After getting deflected by the deflecting mirror 18', the laser beam 15 runs through a<br>
laser exit module 30, in which a protective glass 31 is arranged. This helps in preventing<br>
dirtying of the inner space 16 by particles that get carried away while the laser beam 15<br>
acts on the inner surface 3, and get sprayed from the inner surface 3. The laser beam 15<br>
exits from the laser exit module 30 through the opening 32. The diameter of the opening<br>
32 should be as small as possible, however larger than the beam diameter at this point, in<br>
order to also contribute towards preventing any particles entering into the space 35<br>
between the protective glass 31 and the opening 32.<br>
A further measure for keeping the surface of the protective glass 31 towards the opening<br>
32 clean, is by introducing a gas under pressure into the space 35 between the protective<br>
glass 31 and the opening 32 through a line 40; this gas then again exits through the<br>
opening 32 out of the space 35, so that this flow similarly prevents penetration of<br>
particles blown off from the inner surface 3 on account of the laser effect, on the side of<br>
the protective glass 31 away from the inner surface 3.<br>
Displacement of the setting ring 19 can either be done manually or by a NC-controI to<br>
different diameters of the bore 2.<br>
The deflecting mechanism 18 has, as has been shown, a deflecting mirror 18' that reflects<br>
the laser light. However, it can also be designed as a prism, so that the laser beam 15 gets<br>
deflected on account of the laws of total reflection.<br>
The deflecting mechanism 18 is adjustable, among other things because the deflecting<br>
mirror 18' can be swivelled around the axis B running perpendicular to the drawing<br>
plane. Furthermore, the deflecting mechanism including the axis B on the base 25, can<br>
be rotated around the axis A.<br>
Due to variations during adjusting of the laser beam 15, there could be variations with<br>
respect to the deflecting angle as against exactly 90Â°, and in the diameter of the laser<br>
beam while passing through the opening 32. If the laser beam 15 is not aligned exactly<br>
centric to the tool body 5, then it strays up and down on rotation of the tool body 5. In<br>
case of a slanting arrangement, as indicated only schematically in the design example<br>
shown in figure 2, further variations occur.<br>
If in spite of the measures taken, the protective glass 31 is dirty, then the laser exit<br>
module 30 can be replaced in a very simple manner. This quick and adjustment-free<br>
replacement possibility reduces the standstill periods in production.<br>
The laser honing tool 5 is preferably positioned in the centre of the bore 2 in such a way,<br>
that it can be rotated around the axis A. In this way, the distance between the focusing<br>
lens 17 and the inner surface 3 and hence the focussing plate in which the point P lies,<br>
remains constant.<br>
One can also position the laser honing tool eccentric to the axis of the bore 2 and rotate it.<br>
In this way the distance between the inner surface 3 and the laser honing tool increases.<br>
For this however, the laser honing tool 5 must simultaneously be guided on a circular<br>
path. Alternatively, it is also possible to let the work-piece 1 rotate around the laser<br>
honing tool 5.<br>
In a design example, as shown in figure 2, the laser beam 15 is introduced at an<br>
inclination from outside on the top into the bore 2. The laser honing tool is thereby<br>
positioned outside the bore 2. In that case, a deflection of the laser beam 15, as shown in<br>
figure 1, does not take place.<br>
The processing takes place in such a way, that a bore 2 is initially pre-honed in the usual<br>
way. Then with the help of the described laser-honing tool, the structure formed by the<br>
micro-bags 6 is brought in. Subsequently the inner surface 3 is trimmed in a further work<br>
sequence, i.e. freed from the burrs on the edges of micro-bags 6, and then finish-honed.<br>
Trimming and finish-honing can be done with the help of a single trimming and honing<br>
tool, which is designed as a double flaring tool as shown in figure 3. It has a tool body 51<br>
which is provided with radial slots, into which - alternately - first honing cleats 52 with<br>
short cutting planks 60 for stripping, and second honing cleats 53 with long cutting<br>
planks 61 for finish-honing are arranged. The short honing cleats 52 help to strip the<br>
edges of the micro-bags 6 in the region close to the upper dead centre of a piston that is<br>
arranged in a bore 2 of a combustion engine, can be moved up and down. The short<br>
honing cleats 52 help to strip the edges of the micro-bags 6. For that, only short honing<br>
cleats are required, if for example micro-bags have been attached only in the upper region<br>
(near the upper dead centre of a piston) on the inner surface 3.<br>
If one shifts the flaring rod 54, on which conical/tapered faces 54' are foreseen, which<br>
work along with conical/tapered faces 52' on the honing cleats 52, then the honing cleats<br>
52 get pushed radially outwards. Now stripping can be done. However, if one shifts the<br>
flaring rod 55, which is foreseen with conical/tapered faces 55' that work along with the<br>
conical/tapered faces 53' on the second honing cleats 53, then the second honing cleats<br>
53 get pushed radially outwards. Then final honing is done. During upward movement<br>
of the flaring rods 54 or 55, the honing cleats 52 or 53 are drawn radially inwards by<br>
return springs 56.<br>
