TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
'PROCESS  FOR  PREPARATION  OF<br><br><br><br>
SKIN<br><br>
CARE   COMPOSITION<br><br>
BY<br><br>
COMBINING  MICRO-NUTRIENTS  WITH AYURVEDIC SUBSTANCES".<br>
Mathurakavi Srinivasa Raghavan Ayyangar, 5-C, ' Sett Minar, Pedder Road, Mumbai - 400 026, State of Maharashtra, India, Indian National.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The new question that is gaining momentum all over the world is : Can Nutrition cure? In the prior art to cure any disease medicines or drugs have been used. The word "Cure" itself is not well defined both medically and technically. In the contemporary medical world, "Cure" is explained and understood as the apparent diminution or removal of symptoms. This apparent diminution or removal is established not by dealing with the cause, but only by reducing or removing the capacity of the patient to perceive these symptoms, or, altering the physical manifestation of these symptoms. Thus the Cure here is illusory and not real.<br>
A disease is a vector with a degenerative dynamic, which is a quantitative force with a qualitative identity. Where and how does it originate has never been thoroughly understood, nor the study of this aspect was given the deserved importance in the modern medical research. Effects are interpreted as causes, generating confusion in the path of understanding the true originating dynamics of a disease. In the process, the concept of treating a disease was centered around, creating another vector that purely and squarely opposes the original vector which is described as the disease. This automatically results purely in the suppression of symptoms and not the elimination of them, which should actually be called a Cure. The only way to eliminate the symptom is to deal with the cause than the<br><br><br>
symptom itself. The route to this is to dissipate the disease vector, than to oppose it and keep it suppressed. This is exactly what the complex that is formed by combining Micro Nutrition with Ayurvedic substances can do. But, the key is not just Nutrition, but a "Harmonious Nutrition complex" combined with a suitable "Ayurvedic complex" of Ayurvedic substances suitably processed and tuned towards dissipating the disease vector thus eliminating its existence.<br>
It is a scientifically established fact that Micro Nutrients are vital requirements for health, both as Prophylactics, Curatives and they help accelerate convalescence. It is also an established fact that Ayurvedic substances are potential Prophylactics and Curatives. In the prior art no process is known by which Micro Nutrients can be combined with Ayurvedic substances to arrive at complex which have higher and enhanced efficacy. Need was felt for a process to combine Micro Nutrients with Ayurvedic substances.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide for a novel and useful process for combining micro-nutrients with Ayurvedic substances. Another object of this inventions is to prepare of Skin Care, Skin Cure creams, lotions, pastes, gels, liquids, syrups etc. by combining micro-nutrients with Ayurvedic substances.<br><br><br>
Another object of this invention is to provide for a novel and useful process for combining micro-nutrients with Ayurvedic substances to prepare of Skin Care, Skin Cure creams, lotions, pastes, gels, liquids, syrups etc. by combining micro-nutrients with Ayurvedic substances, which are efficacious, effective in relieving and curing the skin and other ailments.<br>
Emulsifying Wax : It is an official monogram of the I.P., B.P. &amp; U.S.P.. it is mixture of Cetostearyl Alcohol 90% w/w, Sodium Lauryl sulphate 10% w/w, in purified water. It is almost white or pale yellow, waxy solid or flakes: Faint and characteristic. It becomes soft on warming.<br>
Glyceryl Monostearate : It is an official monogram of I.P., B.P. &amp; U.S.P. It is mixture of a major portion of Mono, Di, and Triglyceride of Stearic and Palmitic Acid and minor portion of other Fatty Acid. It may contain free Glycerin, free Fatty Acid &amp; Soap. A white to cream coloured, hard waxy solid with a faint fatty odor. It is an Emulsifying Agent for "oil in water" and "water in oil" emulsions.<br>
The novel process of combining Micro Nutrients with Ayurvedic substances is described hereinafter.<br><br><br>
Step 1 : Melt Emulsifying wax, Glyceryl Monostearate, along with Almond Oil, Coconut Oil and heat to a temperature of 50 to 80 degree Celsius in a Vessel - A.<br>
Step 2 : In Vessel - &amp;, add Dimethylglycine (DMG) (0.2% to 2.00% of the final product)/ Trimethylglycine (TMG) (0.2% to 3.00% of the final product) and Methyl Sufonyl Methane (MSM) (2.00% to 18% of the final product) Complex to distilled water at 50 - 80 degree Celsius and stir thoroughly till the compound completely dissolves.<br>
Step 3 : Thereafter cool it to a temperature of 45 degree Celsius and add Aloe Vera Gel (1.00% to 3.00% of the final product), and Glycerine (5.00% to 12.00% of the final product) to it.<br>
Step 4 : Mix the ingredients of Vessel - B to ingredients of Vessel - A slowly maintaining the temperature at about 40 degree Celsius. While mixing ingredients of A and B vessels ensure that both of them are individually at the same temperature of about 40 Degree Celsius. After whole material of Vessel A and Vessel B are mixed at the same temperature, stir for 45 minute.s to form the Cream,<br><br><br>
Step 5 : Take about 10% part of this Cream into a separate container and add slowly by stirring the extract (containing Ayurvedic Complex) and the required fragrance for 20 minutes.<br>
Step 6 : Add this 10% portion of Cream to the rest of the Bulk Cream. Stir and mix for about 30 minutes.<br>
