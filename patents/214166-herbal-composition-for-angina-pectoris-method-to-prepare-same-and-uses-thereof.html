COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[Section 10]<br>

METHOD TO PREPARE SAME AND USES THEREOF"<br>
2.	(a)       TIANJIN TASLY PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.,<br>
(b)	No. 1 Liaohedong Road, Xinyibai Avenue,<br>
Beichen District, Tianjin 300402.<br>
P. R. CHINA<br>
(c)	P. R. CHINA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
TO PREPARE SAME AND USES THEREOF<br><br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced and full citations for these publications may be found in the reference at the end of the specifications preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to the skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chronic stable angina pectoris is due to transit myocardial ischemia. Aspirin, nitrates, beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, and calcium channel blocking drugs used alone or in combination with one another are the commonly used drugs for angina pectoris .<br>
Aspirin as an antithrombotic agent is a symptomatic treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris.<br>
Nitrates are used to treat an anginal episode and can be successfully used in prophylaxis by patients with predictable symptoms. With all nitrates, troublesome headache can prevent their use in certain susceptible individuals.<br>
Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, although (established as a cornerstone in the treatment of angina, are specifically contraindicated in patients with obstructive airways diseases and severe ventricular dysfunction, and relatively contraindicated in diabetes and in those with peripheral vascular disease, bradycardia or heart block.<br>
Calcium antagonists are certainly effective in angina, achieving their effects by smooth muscle relaxation in the coronary arteries and peripheral circulation, increasing myocardial supply and reducing myocardial work.<br>
2 <br>
Although there is progress in drug combination therapy in angina, which most patients begin treatment with nitrates and a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug or a calcium antagonist, there is a need of drug for chronic stable angina pectoris which is very effective, can be taken for a long period of time and has very low toxicity.<br>
In view of the problems of relating to the above mentioned drugs,<br>
notable' efforts have been made to apply herbal Medicine as an<br>
alternative to the standard treatment of chronic stable angina<br>
pectoris. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has contributed much<br>
in this respect.	,<br>
US Pat. No. 5288485 and 5433957 refer to an extract from hypericum erectum thunb for curing or preventing diseases caused by disorder in blood circulation such as angina pectoris.<br>
US Pat. No. 5776463 refers to an oral pharmaceutical composition containing petals of borage or extract of borage petals for the prevention and treatment of stress which is associated with circulatory heart diseases-'including angina.<br>
In addition to hypericum erectum thunb and borage petals, many other herbal plants have also been used to treat angina. One such plant is Valeriana officinalis latifolia. Yang GY et al (1994) Reported that 82 patients with angina pectoris had been treated with Valeriana officinalis latifolia, among whom ST-T ischemic changes appeared on ECG in 50 cases before treatment. Its total effective rate for simple angina (without detectable ischemic findings) was 87.80%; the angina with ischemic findings, 88.00%. In addition, it was discovered that Valeriana officinalis latifolia could lower plasma lipids as well. No toxic actions to liver, kidney, and hemopoietic tissue, have been found.(1)<br>
Wu Y (1990) reported that in a setting of 267 patients with angina pectoris, 93 .3% of the patients treated with xintongkang capsule was effective.<br>
3<br><br>
Another herbal preparation called Shenshao tongguan pian was used in treating angina pectoris. In 1990, Hu JX et al. Reported that the Shenshao tongguan pian is composed chiefly of saponin from the stem and leaves of Ginseng and Radix Paeoniae Alba, etc. The total effective rate for treating angina pectoris was 94.71%. And the ECG improvement rate was 63.38%. In addition, laboratory examination also revealed that Shenshao tongguan pian could promote the left ventricular output, lower the blood viscosity and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelet. Both acute and chronic toxicity tests showed that Shenshao tongguan pian has no toxicity or side effects.<br>
Kuo-guan   granule is another herbal preparation for angina pectoris. Li Y et al. (1990) reported that the changes of the plasma zinc, copper and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and DTNB color development in 31 patients suffering from coronary heart disease with angina pectoris before and after taking Kuo-Guan  granule for one month. The results indicated that the plasma zinc and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase were lower and copper was higher in the patients than the normal control group before treatment (P 
Saponin of Tribulus terrestris was another herbal composition for treating angina pectoris.<br>
Fufang Danshen Pian is a folk prescription of Dan Shen Tablet which indicate for treating chronic stable angina pectoris due to coronary artery ischemia and has been officially listed in the editions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1977 and applied to clinical use for decades.<br>
4<br><br>
Fufang Danshen Pian contains multiple active extracts of botanical including Danshen [Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), and Sanchi [Radix Notoginseng) . Both of the botanical were first documented in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing [Shen-nong's Herbal Pharmacopoeia) completed in 200. Fufang Danshen Pian also contains synthetic borneol, a version of a natural borneol (Bingpian). Natural borneol was first documented in Tang Ben Cab (Herbal Pharmacopoeia of the Tang Dynasty) compiled around 659.<br>
Li Cheng-zhu et al (1979) reported in (Acta Acad Med Prim Shanghai) on an experimental study of thrombotic inhibition effect of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae. Effects on in vitro thrombosis, functions of platelet and coagulation, fibrinolysis were observed in rabbits. After injection of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae, 3 links were found to play an important role in inhibition of in vitro thrombosis: (1) inhibition of platelet function; (2) inhibition of coagulation function; and (3) promote fibrinolysis. Of which, the former two mechanisms function more intensely. The results conform' to those in the treatment of thrombotic diseases, especially arterial thrombotic diseases.<br>
Chiang WT et al (1982) reported in (Acta Acad Med Prim Shanghai) the effects of "Danshensu" and other two water-soluble components of salvia miltiorrhiza on dog ischemic myocardium and isolated pig coronary artery. The effect of 3 new water-soluble components i.e. Danshensu (DS-182, D(+)-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid) , protocathu-aldehyde (PCAD) and an impure diterpene acid (DS-187) isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, were compared with those of dipyridamole. Results revealed (1) in mice, DS-182 gave significant protection against hypoxia, whereas PCAD was ineffective; (2) DS-182 could nullify the pituitrin-induced electrocardiographic ischemic ST-T elevation but had no influence on the reduced heart rate. DS-187, PCAD and dipyridamole only showed incomplete protection; (3) in the acutely infarcted dog model prepared by ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, the benefits<br>
5<br><br>
achieved by intravenous injection of DS-182 proved superior to<br>
DS-187 and PCAD in respect to the left ventricular function, left<br>
ventricular peak systolic pressure(LVPSP)  and left ventricular<br>
end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) .    PCAD, on the contrary, produced<br>
adverse effects on LVPSP and LVEDP.    Intravenously administered<br>
dipyridamole,  though it did not change LVEDP,  suppressed LVPSP<br>
significantly   with   marked   hypotensive    effect.       All    these<br>
components of Salvia and dipyridamole significantly reduced the<br>
ultimate myocardial infarct size  (N-BT assessment); Ds-182 was<br>
most effective, dipyridamole and DS-187 the next, while PCAD the<br>
least;     (4)     in   the    isolated   perfused   pig    coronary   artery<br>
preparation, DS-182 significantly reduced the resistance of the<br>
coronary vessel, whereas either DS-187, PCAD or sodium Tanshinone<br>
II-A sulfonate (DS-201) , another component of Salvia, increased<br>
it. The constrictory action of morphine and propranolol on the<br>
isolated coronary artery preparation was antagonized by the prior<br>
administration of DS-182. All of these suggested that Danshensu<br>
might be  the main active principle of  Salvia miltiorrhiza in<br>
treating ischemic heart disease and that its concomitant use with<br>
propranolol or morphine would be beneficial.<br>
Li Cheng-zhu et al (1983) reported in (Chin J Integr Med) the anti-coagulation effect of Radix SilviaeMiltiorrhizae. Danshensu is a water-soluble monomer extracted from Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae. It is also the main ingredient of commercially sold Injection Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae. The present study proved that Danshensu inhibits thrombosis in vitro, aggregation of platelet (induced by ADP) ,and internal and external coagulation systems; diminishes the number of platelets and promotes the degradation of fibrin or fibrinogen. The effects peaked 30 minutes after a single injection of 20 mg/kg in rabbits, lasted for 1 hour, and recovered gradually. 4.5 hours after injection, all recovered to normal but thrombosis test in vitro.<br>
Chen Zhanghua  (1987)  reported in Acta Acad Med Prim Shanghai on effects     of     "Danshensu"     on     experimental     microcirculatory<br>
6<br><br>
disturbances and plasm lactic acid concentrations. Natural Danshensu is a water soluble monomer extracted from Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae(RSM). Microcirculatory disturbances in rabbits were induced by intravenous injection of high molecular weight dextran. Natural Danshensu (dosage 4-6 mg/kg) markedly increased the number of capillary vessels in the bulbar conjunctiva, and also decreased the concentration of plasm lactic acid in the rabbits. Mesenteric microcirculatory disorders were produced by local noradrenaline (4 g) drip in mice. Natural Danshensu dilated the arteries and accelerated the speed of blood flow, thus eliminating microcirculatory blood stasis. In our experiments, effects of synthetic Danshensu were observed concomitantly. The results showed that there was no significant difference between natural and synthetic Danshensu in relieving microcirculatory disturbances.<br>
Sun Xi-ming et al (1991) reported a new pharmacological action of an extract of Danshen (Salvia mil tiorrhiza) . The paper reports that an extract of Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) which contains the sodium salts of D(+) - (3y4-dihydroxy phenyl) lactic acid was found to possess a new pharmacological action of decreasing the biosynthesis of cholesterol in cells and anti-lipoprotein oxidation, by cell cultural studies. When compared with the control, its electrophoretic migration rate was markedly lowered and MDA content and cytotoxicity decreased obviously. These results indicated that salts of D(+)-(3,4-dihydroxy phenyl) lactic acid may be effective in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.<br>
Zheng Ruo-xuan et al (1992) reported in (Chin J Integr Med) the preservation effect of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae on myocardial ischemia induced by coronary ligation in mice. Obvious preservation effect on acute myocardial ischemia in mice by coronary ligation could be obtained after i.p. water-extract of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae (5 g crude drug/kg) . S-T segment elevation on ECG due to myocardial ischemia in the treatment group<br>
7<br><br>
was much lower, ischemic size of the left ventricle was smaller and the survival rate was higher when compared with the control.<br>
Wu Yao-zhong et al (1995) reported in (Acta Nanjing Univ Trad Chin Mater Med) on effects of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae in promoting blood circulation by removing blood stasis. Pharmacological research of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae is common. However, rheological studies on Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae by assessing PGI2, ET, and TXA2 produced by platelet are seldom. Influence of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae on thrombosis, changes of PT, KPTT, FG, ESR and HCT, and aggregation of platelet in rabbits are evaluated in the present study. Conclusions are that Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae reduces the synthesis of TXA2 and decreases the effects of enhancement of platelet aggregation and thrombosis.<br>
Shi Lin et al (1990) reported in (Acta Pharmcol Sin) on the effects of total saponins of Panax Notoginseng  on increasing PGI2 in carotid artery and decreasing TXA2 in blood platelet. Total saponins of Panax  notoginseng   (PNS) were given orally 100 mg/(kg'day) to rabbit for 8 wk. Aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation was restrained as compared that of to the control group. Radioimmunoassay was used to investigate the effects of PNS on the contents of prostacyclin in carotid artery and thromboxane A2 in rats' blood platelet. Oral administration of PNS 25, 50, 100 mg/ (kg'day) for 10 days caused an increase of prostacyclin in carotid artery and a decrease of thromboxane A2 in blood platelet as compared with the control group.  These results showed that the anti-atherosclerotic action of PNS maybe a result of the correction of the imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A2.<br>
Li Xing et al (1990) reported in (Acta Pharmacol Sin) the Protective effects of Panax Notoginseng saponin on experimental myocardial injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in rats. Effects of total saponin of Panax Notoginseng  (PNS) and purified<br>
8 <br>
ginsenoids Rbi and Rgi from PNS on myocardial injury induced by cardiac ischemia and reperfusion were studied using rat hearts in situ and in vitro. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, PNS pretreatment (100 and 200 mg/kg) provided significant reduction in myocardial infarcted size after left descending coronary artery ligation (40 min) and reperfusion (120 min) in comparison with the control. PNS 12 .5 and 25 mg/L, Rbi 10 mg/L and Rgl 10 mg/L significantly decreased cardiac CPK release, attenuated myocardial Ca++ accumulation, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production and prevented reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in comparison with the control in perfused isolated rat hearts with global ischemia (40 min) and reperfusion (15 min) . The results showed that PNS, Rbi and Rgi prevented cardiac ischemia and the action was considered to be related to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation.<br>
Huang Cong et al (1991) reported in (Chin Bull Pharmacol) the effects of Panax Notoginseng Saponin on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in conscious rabbits. The effects of Panax Notoginseng saponin (PNGS) on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in conscious rabbits were studied with observation of changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) , the activities of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and the size of ischemic area. PNGS at the dose of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the size of myocardial ischemic area. These results suggested that PNGS have the protective effects on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury.<br>
Mo Qi-xian et al (1987) reported in (Propriet Trad Chin Med Res) the dynamics of 3H-Borneol. In order to highlight the mechanism of inducing resuscitation of Boraeol aromaticity, dynamics of 3H-Borneol were conducted by intraveneous injection and oral administration. The results revealed that the half-life time was 2.8 min after a single intraveneous injection of 3H-Borneol. It suggested that the drug distributed rapidly to the relevent<br>
9<br><br>
organs and tissues after administration and produced prompt effect. In vivo distribution concentrated on organs and tissues which are abundant in blood flow, such as heart, lung, liver, kidney and brain, etc. This provided clinical application certain theoratical basis. Since the diminishing half-life time was 5.3 hours after oral administration of the drug, this suggested that oral Borneol could not lead to accumulation, but poor bioavailability. Further studies should be taken to discusse the relationship with drug dose and dosage form.<br>
Chen Tie-feng et al (1990) reported in (Acta Pharmacol Sin) the enhancement of absorption of tetramethylpyrazine by synthetic borneol. Sprague-Dawley rats were given ig tetramethylpyrazine phosphate (TMP) 5 mg/kg with or without previous borneol 5 mg/kg. The plasm TMP concentrations were analysed by GC method, and the data were treated by NONLIN program. The Cmax were 931 and 562 ng/ml, respectively, (p
Xu Wei et al (1995) reported in (Pharmacol Chin Med Clin) the effect of menthol and borneol on the distribution of sulfadiazine sodium and Evan's blue in the rat and mouse brain. Menthol (1.5 g/kg, ig) and Borneol (1.5 g/kg) prolonged the sulfadiazine sodium distribution half-life ti/2 in rats. The above dosage of menthol and borneol given orally also increased the concentration of sulfadiazine sodium in the rat brain. Menthol (ig 0.5g/kg for 3 days) and borneol (ig 0.5 g/kg for 3 days) promoted the concentration of Evan's blue in the mouse brain, but the value of concentration was significantly lower than that of the mice suffering from the ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results suggested that the menthol and borneol could enhanced the sulfadiazine sodium transfer in brain-blood barrier with no damage to brain-blood barier.<br>
In the United States, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is<br>
10<br><br>
the commonest cause of cardiovascular disability and death.<br>
Atherosclerosis is an arterial disorder characterized by yellowish plaques of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris in the inner layers of the walls of large and medium-size arteries . The condition begins as a fatty streak and gradually builds to a fibrous plaque or atheromatous lesion. The blood vessel walls become thick, fibrotic, and calcified. The artery lumen narrows.<br>
Many atherosclerotic plaques remain stable or progress gradually. Others may rupture resulting in hemorrhage, platelet activation, and thus intravascular thrombosis. Coronary thrombosis causes partial or complete vessel occlusion, impairs blood flow, thus leads to unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Alternately, the ruptured plaques may become restabilized, often more severe stenosis.<br>
Exercise and mental stresses increase myocardial oxygen demand. Under normal physiological condition, increased myocardial oxygen demand is met by the arterioles dilating thus increasing blood flow. In the presence of atherosclerosis, the arterioles may dilate maximally to meet basic demand. Such dilated arterioles may be unable to meet the increased myocardial oxygen demand. When oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply, the ischemia of myocardium occurs. Alternately, severe vessel occlusions may limit blood flow thus cause myocardial ischemia. Clinical manifestations of transient myocardial ischemia is angina pectoris which is a paroxysmal thoracic pain, frequently spread to the arms, particularly to the left arm, with or without accompanied by a feeling of suffocating and impending death.<br>
Angina pectoris is subdivided in to two: stable and unstable. Stable angina pectoris is caused by the increased myocardial oxygen demand in most cases. Stable angina thus attacks in the predictable frequency and duration upon provocation which increases myocardial oxygen requirements such as exercise, mental stress, etc. In contrast, unstable angina pectoris attacks<br>
11<br><br>
without provocation and usually caused by decreased oxygen supply to myocardium. Plaque disruption, platelet plugging, and coronary thrombosis decrease oxygen supply to myocardium.<br>
Angina pectoris is treated with various drugs, surgical procedure, coronary artery bypass graft, balloon-angioplasty, stent placement, etc. Therapy for stable angina pectoris is primarily to minimize myocardial oxygen demand as well as a preventive measure. Therapy for the acute syndrome unstable angina pectoris is primarily to inhibit platelet activation and thrombolysis.<br>
Current therapeutic agents for chronic stable angina pectoris are nitroglycerine, other nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. These drugs, administered alone or in combination with other drugs, alleviate or prevent rather than cure angina.<br>
When angina attacks, nitroglycerine is administered sublingually to alleviate symptoms. Nitroglycerine is also applied to prevent anginal attacks caused by exertion and stress. Nitrates are applied to prevent angina attacks. Nitroglycerine and nitrates mediate their effect primarily by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, reducing myocardial activity, and thus reducing myocardial oxygen demand. The side effects are throbbing headache, dizziness, weakness, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, etc.<br>
Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers such as propranolol are applied to prevent angina pectoris by reducing myocardial oxygen requirements during exertion and stress. The major contraindications are bronchospastic disease, bradyarrhythmias, and overt heart failure. In individuals with asthma and other forms of airway obstruction, beta-blockers may worsen their condition.<br>
Calcium antagonists are applied to prevent angina pectoris by reducing the oxygen demand of myocardium. Myocardium is dependent on calcium influx for normal functions. By inhibiting calcium<br>
12 <br>
influx, calcium antagonists may relax smooth muscle of the blood vessel, decrease myocardium activity, reduce oxygen demand by myocardium, and thus prevent angina pectoris. Calcium antagonists have adverse side effects. The mild side effects are flushing, edema, dizziness, nausea, etc. Excessive inhibition of calcium influx to myocardium may cause severe side effects such as cardiac arrest, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, congestive heart failure, etc. Combined with beta-adrenergic drugs, the side effects of calcium antagonists are often augmented.<br>
In China, Panax Notoginseng and Radix Salviae Miltorrhizae have been used for treating cardiovascular disease since 200 AD (Shen-nong's Herbal Pharmacopoeia) . Panax Notoginseng has been used for treating angina pectoris. Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae has been used for promoting blood circulation and dispersing blood stasis. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Panax Notoginseng and Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae.<br>
Traditional Chinese medicine is the mixture of several herbs requiring decoction. A modified form of Chinese medicine for . treating coronary heart disease is Dan Shen tablet. Dan Shen tablet is a large unctuous ball, often as large as 1 cM in diameter. Dan Shen tablets are made of the extract of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, powder of Panax Notoginseng and synthetic borneol, have been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1977, and have been used to treat cardiovascular disease for decades.<br>
The disclosed Danshen pill (DSP) or called cardiotonic pill is a new generation Chinese medicine for coronary heart diseases. Chinese medicine consists of various herbs which vary from prescription to prescription in regard to the type of herbs as well as the proportion of herbs. To control the quality, DSP is manufactured with . the standarized formula. The therapeutic components of DSP are the water-soluble extracts of Radix Salviae<br>
13<br><br>
Miltiorrhizae 10-30 % and sometimes, approximately 20 %, the water-soluble extracts of Panax Notoginseng (2-6 %), and borneol (1-3 %). Furthermore, to alleviate angina quickly, DSP been manufactured as a small pill which can be dissolved immediately upon sublingual administration, delivered to myocardium quickly, and thus alleviate angina fast.<br>
DSP has been proven to be nontoxic and effective for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease caused by coronary artery ischemia in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, the superior efficacy of DSP to Dan Shen tablets for treating coronary arterial disease has been demonstrated in preclinical as well as in clinical studies.<br>
DSP has been listed in the Supplement Edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1998, approved by the Chinese Ministry of Health, marketed as a drug in China since 1993, and used by more than five million people.<br>

For manufacturing DSP, Notoginseng and Salviae are extracted separately with hot water in circulating systems and filtered. The filtrates are condensed under decompressed conditions, filtered and precipitated. The concentrates are refined using resin columns and concentrated under decompressed conditions. The refined water-soluble extracts thus obtained were mixed with synthetic Borneol and pharmaceutical carriers. The mixture is made to a small pill using a special dropping machine.  The quality of DSP is controlled by standarizing the quantity as well as the proportion of its major therapeutic components Saponon, phenolic acid such as Danshensu and Borneol. Thin-layer chromatography,  high  performance  liquid  chromatography, fingerprinting and other analytical techniques are used to identify and quantitate therapeutic components in DSP.<br>

CLINICAL STUDIES OF DSP<br>
Angina pectoris is evaluated by the history of angina, serum lipid level, electrocardiography (ECG), exercise ECG, scintiographic assessment of ischemia, coronary angiography, etc. Assessing therapeutic efficacy using these end points, DSP has been shown to be effective for treating angina pectoris.<br>
DSP is effective for angina pectoris.<br>
157 patients with coronary heart disease were treated with 10 DSPs per t.i.d., oral administration for 4 weeks. Assessing the frequency, intensity and duration of angina, oppressed feeling in chest and palpitation, the symptoms were disappeared or remitted in 95.3% patients.<br>
DSP is more efficient than Dan Shen tablets in alleviating angina. Dan Shen tablet is another Chinese medicament for treating angina pectoris currently used in China. The efficacy of DSP and Dan Shen tablet was compared. Coronary heart disease patients were randomly divided into two groups. 107 patients were treated with DSP and 50 patients were treated with Dan Shen Tablet. Comparing the frequency of angina attacks and the consumption of nitrates, DSP was more effective than Dan Shen Tablets for treating angina pectoris. See Table 5 below.<br>

Having proven that DSP is more effective than Dan Shen tablets, the efficacy of DSP was compared with various drugs which are currently used for treating chronic stable angina pectoris in the US.<br>
Comparison of DSP and nitroglycerine<br>
Nitroglycerine is the frequently used to relieve angina. The efficacy of DSP and nitroglycerine relieving angina was compared. At the onset of angina, patients were treated with either DSP or nitroglycerine, and the time required to alleviate angina was compared. Both DSP and nitroglycerine alleviate angina in all patients within 15 minutes. The efficacy of DSP was slightly lower than nitroglycerine. See Table 6 below.<br>

DSP does not change heart rate<br>
The date demonstrate that DSP effectively alleviate angina. It was examined whether DSP relieves anginal by increasing heart rate. The heart rate after DSP treatment was equivalent to the pretreatment rate, which indicates that DSP relieves angina without affecting heart rate (Table 7).<br>

Comparison of the efficacy of DSP with the nitrate isosorbide dinitrate<br>
Having proven that DSP alleviate angina as efficiently as nitroglycerin, it was examined whether DSP can prevent angina. The efficacy of DSP and the nitrate isosorbide dinitrate was compared. Isosorbide dinitrate is a long-acting nitrate frequently used for preventing chronic stable angina pectoris in the US. Patients were treated with either DSP three times per day orally 10 pills per treatment or Isosorbide dinitrate three times per day orally 10 mg per treatment. Cardiac function and Electrocardiogram was examined.<br>
Cardiac function.<br>
The efficacy of DSP and nitrates on cardiac function was evaluated by measuring cardiac output per stroke (CO), stroke volume per minute (SV) , eject blood fraction (EF), fraction of shortened rate of left ventricular short axis (FS). DSP improves cardiac function more efficiently than nitrates. See Table 8 below.<br>

Comparison of DSP and aspirin in reducing blood stasis Hemorrhage at the atherosclerotic lesions induces platelet activation, coronary thrombosis and blood stasis resulting in impaired blood flow. Thus to improve blood flow, chronic administration of the platelet-activation inhibitor aspirin is recommended for patients with angina. The efficacy of DSP and aspirin improving blood flow was compared by evaluating [Hb, Lb, P and air flow] . DSP improves blood flow as efficiently as aspirin. DSP improves blood flow as efficiently as aspirin. See Table 10 below.<br>

DSP reduces blood stasis by inhibiting platelet activation Thromboxane B2 activates platelet. Activated platelets release various substances including (S  platelet microglobulin, which<br>
35 <br>
causes blood stasis, thus impairing blood flow. The efficacy of DSP inhibiting platelet activation was examined. DSP lowers thromboxane B2 concentration and inhibits platelet aggregation efficiently. Isosorbide dinitrate, which is known to be unable to inhibit platelet activation thus used as control, did not reduce thromboxane B2 or inhibit platelet activation. See Table 11 below.<br>

DSP lowers plasma cholesterol level<br>
Increased plasma cholesterol has been implicated in the initiation of atherosclerosis. To prevent the formation of new atherosclerotic lesions, the decrease of plasma cholesterol either by modifying diets:or drugs was recommended. It was examined whether DSP decreases plasma cholesterol. DSP lowered the cholesterol level by 0.3 mmol/L, which is statistically significant at the P value 0.05. See Table 12 below.<br>

Cardiotonic Pill's Effect on LPO and SOD in the Blood Serum of Patients Suffering from Coronary Heart Disease<br>
The method: In the treatment group, 24 patients, in accordance with China Reference Diagnosis Standards for Coronary Heart Disease amended in 1979, are administered with Cardiotonic Pill, 10 pills/time, and 3 times/day. In the normal group, 20 healthy<br>
36<br><br>
people do not receive any medical treatment.<br>
The results: The level of LPO of the patients suffering from coronary heart disease is clearly higher than that of the healthy people, while the content of SOD is clearly lower (p

Note: In comparison with the normal group, *p
The conclusion: Chronic ischemia of cardiac muscles of patients suffering from coronary heart disease and tissue anoxia lead to the reduction of the activity of SOD, especially that of extra cellular SOD, and the increase of oxygen free radicals, which causes the elevation of LPO and consumption of SOD further. After the patients are treated with Cardiotonic Pill, the level of LPO decreases evidently, while the content of the SOD increases obviously. This proves that Cardiotonic Pill has a strong action of clearance on oxygen free radicals, which is also one of the mechanisms to treat coronary heart disease.<br>
The Effect of Cardiotonic Pill on the Activities of LPO and Antioxidases in Treatment of Pulmonary Heart Disease<br>
The method: The subjects: 48 patients suffering from pulmonary heart disease are randomly divided into 3 groups. In the normal group, 16 patients are treated with a complex of therapies, such as anti-inf lamatory therapy, antiasthma, oxygen inhalation, and so on. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, 14 patients are treated with Cardiotonic Pill, 10 pills/time, and 3 times/day. In the<br>

Gantangzhi group , 18 patients are treated with the intravenous<br>
drip	200mg of Gantangzhi dissolved in 250ml of 5% glucose<br>
injection, 1 time/day, and 10 days/period.<br>
The results: After treatment with Cardiotonic Pill, the value of GSH-Px goes up, the value of LPO goes down, and, therefore, GSH-Px/LPO goes up. In comparison with the normal treatment group, there is a significant difference. See Table 14 below.<br>

The conclusion: Cardiotonic Pill has the function of antioxidation, and can lighten the lipid peroxidation reaction and raise the ability of antioxidation of human body.<br>
Treatment with Cardiotonic Pill for Essential Hypertension The method: (1) The choice of patients: Select those patients suffering from Phase I or II essential hypertension, but without secondary  hypertension  or  cardiac,  hepatic  and  renal insufficiencies.<br>
(2) The administration: Stop the patients from taking any western and traditional Chinese medicines (except for hypotensors) for two weeks, and then, in the third week, measure their blood pressures and blood rheologyical indices and take down their clinical manifestations. The double blind method is adopted. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, the subjects take orally Cardiotonic Pill, 10 pi lis/time, and 3 times/day. In Compound Danshen Tablet<br>

group, the subjects take orally Compound Danshen Tablet, 5 tablets/time, and 3 times/day. The subjects in the control group take placebos, and the period of treatment is six weeks.<br>
The results: (1) Effect on the viscosity of whole blood. After treatment, the viscosities of whole blood of patients in both the Cardiotonic Pill group and the Compound Danshen Tablet group drop remarkably, but the curves of the viscosities of whole blood in the Cardiotonic Pill group at any shear rates go down more sharply than those in the Compound Danshen Tablet group.

The conclusion: The rheological property of erythrocytes of patients suffering from essential hypertension is clearly abnormal. The deformation of erythrocytes debases clearly, while the aggregation rises distinctly. The experiment shows that Cardiotonic Pill has the functions of markedly reducing the viscosity of whole blood 'and the index of and the area of aggregation of erythrocytes, and greatly raising the ability of deformation of erythrocytes. Cardiotonic Pill can also lower the blood pressure and improve clinical symptoms of the patients. And thus, Cardiotonic Pill is of great benefit to preventing or postponing the occurrence of essential hypertension and cardio-cerebral syndrome.<br>
Toxicity<br>
DSP is safe and nontoxic. In China, over 5 million patients have been treated with DSP without severe side effects. Mild side effects, headache or dizziness, have been reported in a minor portion of patients.<br>
Summary of clinical studies<br>
DSP is a new generation Chinese medicine for treating coronary<br>
heart disease. Clinical studies demonstrate that DSP alleviates<br>
41 <br>
as well as prevent angina by improving cardiac function, reducing myocardial ischemia, inhibiting platelet activation thus reducing blood stasis, and decreasing plasma cholesterol. The therapeutic efficacy of DSP was superior to another form of Chinese medicament Dan Shen tablets. DSP is as efficient as drugs used in the USA. DSP is aleviate angina as efficiently as nitroglycerine, prevents angina as efficiently as the long-acting nitrate isosorbid dinitrate, and inhibits platelet aggregation as effectively as aspirin. DSP is nontoxic: over 5 million people have been treated without noticeable side effects in most cases.<br>
PRECLINICAL STUDIES<br>
Preclinical studies reveal the mechanism by which DSP prevent<br>
as well as alleviate angina.<br>
DSP alleviate angina by increasing blood flow. Wistar rats, approximately 260 g, were anesthetized by urethane, opened the chest, excise the heart, perfused in the Langendorff mode at 37°C.   And constant coronary perfusion pressure of 65 cm H20.<br>
After stabilized the heart rate, various amounts of DSP or Danshen tablet were applied each time through lateral branch of aorta cannula. Subsequently, the coronary flow and the heart rate were measured. DSP increased coronary flow in a wide dosage. Danshen tablet, on the other hand, increased coronary flow at a narrow dosage. See Table 19 below.<br>

Cardiotonic Pill's Action of Clearance on Oxygen Free Radicals The study of Cardiotonic Pill's action of clearance on oxygen free radicals is carried out by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and spin trapping, with superoxide anions and hydroxy radicals produced by using the xanthine- xanthine oxidase system and the H202-Fe2* system respectively.<br>
The method: (1) Production of hydroxy radicals. Set up a test model according to the Fenton Principle. Mix up H202, ferrisulphas and DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline-l-oxide), and then carry out the EPR testing. The resulting signals serve as the control. Add<br>

(2) Production of superoxide anions. Set up a test model based on the xanthine- xanthine oxidase reaction. Mix up xanthine, Dietrylene triamine Pentacetic acid, DMPO and xanthine oxidase, and then carry out the EPR testing. The resulting signals serve as the control. Add Cardiotonic Pill in the treatment group.<br>
Ten samples for each of the four groups are tested, and the results are expressed in terms of the average. T-test is applied in the statistical analysis.<br>
The Results: (1) Cardiotonic Pill's action of clearance on hydroxy radicals produced by the H202-Fe2+ system. An adduct DMPO-OH will be generated when a hydroxy radical is captured by a DMPO. The peak value of the adducts in the control group is<br>
11.8±0.6 relative units, while that in the Cardiotonic Pill<br>
group is 4.1+0.5 relative units. There is a significant<br>

Cardiotonic Pill's Effect on Free Radicals of Cerebral Ischemia Reinfusion Injury Tissue of Rats<br>
The method: Take 30 SD rats, and randomly divide them into 3 groups, which are the feigned operation group (An operation is performed, but the blood vessels and nerves are not ligated), the cerebral ischemia reinfusion model group and the Cardiotonic Pill group (4g/kg). After the 3-day continuous intraperitoneal (Ip) administration, and two hours after the administration on the third day, the rats are anaesthetized with the 20% Ethylurethanm and their conducting arteries in both sides of their necks and vagus nerves are separated and ligated. After a 30-minute reinfusion, cut off their heads and get their brains. Take about 500mg of cortical tissues of their left-brains and hippocampus tissues in both sides, and put them into the liquid nitrogen for homogenization. After they are made into a homogenate with freezing physiological saline, centrifugate the homogenate. Take the supernatant and determine the activities of CAT and SOD and the contents of MAD and GSH.<br>
The results: See Table 29. ,(1) Cardiotonic Pill's effect on the activity of CAT and the content GSH of brain tissues. The activities of CAT of brain cortex and hippocampus tissues and the content of GSH of the brain cortex in the cerebral ischemia reinfusion model group are much lower than those in the feigned operation group. Both the activity of CAT of hippocampus tissues and the content of GSH of the brain cortex in the Cardiotonic Pill group are significantly greater than those in the model group.<br>

(2) Cardiotonic Pill's effect on the activity of SOD and the content MDA of brain tissues. The activity of SOD of brain tissues in the model group is significantly lower than that in the feigned operation group, while the content of MDA is significantly higher. The activities of SOD of brain cortex and hippocampus tissues in the Cardiotonic Pill group increase significantly, while the content of MDA decreases significantly.<br>
The conclusion: After cerebral ischemia reinfusion, the content of MDA in the brain tissues increases, while the content of GSH decreases. The activities of CAT and SOD, two important enzymes for clearing oxygen free radicals in the tissues, decrease significantly, which shows that during the course of cerebral ischemia reinfusion, a great lot of oxygen free radicals occur due to the failure of the function of the free radical clearance system. This leads to the lipid peroxidation, and then leads to the brain injury. Cardiotonic Pill can decrease the contents of MDA in the brain cortex and hippocampus tissues of reinfused rats and increase the content of GSH and the activities of CAT and SOD greatly, which shows that Cardiotonic Pill has the functions of markedly restraining the reactions of oxygen free radicals, controlling the lipid peroxidation and protecting damaged brain cells caused by ischemia reinfusion.<br>
The Antioxidation of Cardiotonic Pill in Chronic Hepatic Injury The method: The CCL4-high-fat-low-protein induced mild chronic<br>
49 <br>
hepatic injury model of the Wister rat is adopted. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, perfuse Cardiotonic Pill into the rats' stomachs at the dose of 4g/kg, while in the normal and the model groups, perfuse the same amount of physiological saline. The activity of SOD is determined by using the xanthine oxidase method, while the content of the MDA is determined by using the improved thiobarbituric acid method.<br>
The results: See Table 30. Comparing the model group with the normal group, the activity of SOD degrades, while that of MDA increases. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, however, the activity of SOD increases, while that of MDA degrades, making the Cardiotonic Pill group go back to the normal.<br>

Note: In comparison with the normal group, *p
The conclusion: MDA is a major degradation product of the lipid peroxidation. MDA can badly damage the structure of the cell membrane, and then hepatic cells. SOD is a scavenger of super-oxide anion free radicals, and it can restrain the lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals. Cardiotonic Pill can significantly increase the activity of SOD and decrease the content of MDA, which will degrade the level of the lipid peroxidation and lighten the hepatic injury.<br>

(9)	Handle with Soil<br>
For prevention of root damage, 75-100g of lime is used each square meter before transplanting.<br>
(10)	Construction and management of Shade<br>
The shade is 1.8m above ground with a 2m deep trench below the ground. Sunlight penetration is best at 8-10% if in area of no more than 1600 m above sea level, or 10-15% if it is more than 1600 m. The ground should be flat; deep layer of the earth should be lose; while the surface level of the earth should be rigid. Planting season is best at the end of December to the end of January. Before planting, the seeds should be immersed in 58% metalaxylic zinc (500-800x) or 1.5% antimycin (200ppm) for 30-50 minutes and dip out to let dry. This is to protect the plant from diseases (Coated seeds do not have to undergo the above procedures). Density of planting is to be 4 x 5 cm or 5 x 5 cm, with 100-200 thousand seeds per mu of land. Use special tools to create a shallow gutter and use machine or hands to seed and plant. Seeds are covered with fine soil completely.<br>
After all, fertilizing, watering and weeding tasks are performed. Weeds should be eliminated all the time. If the shade is broken, it should be repaired immediately and ensured the correct penetration of sunlight. Natural fertilizers including poultry waste, stove dust, and bone dust (human waste should not apply) .<br>
