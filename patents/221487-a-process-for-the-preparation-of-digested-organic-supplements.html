				<td>This  invention relates to a process for  the preparation  of digested organic supplements (DOrS)  and an apparatus therefore.<br>
Composting   of   the   raw   material   like<br>
agricultural waste and poultry droppings, mushroom spent waste, rock phosphate and other garvage, is as such<br>
known in the art. The composting process comprises in dropping the agricultural waste or other qarvaqe into<br>
a pit or in the form of a heap which is being allowed to be decomposed to a natural manner. The other process<br>
is a mechanical composting wherein the raw material is passed through a mechanical device consisting of maqnets<br>
and conveyor belt to separate out metallic objects from the agricultural waste or other qarvaqe. The waste after<br>
removing the metallic objects is subjected to the step of crushing so as to get powder which is sieved and<br>
packed.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the process as such known in the art. The main disadvantage<br>
is that the technology is of high standard and the initial investment is high for a small volume of compost<br>
product ion.<br>
Another  disadvantage  is  that  the  skilled persons  are  required  to operate  the  plant  and  the maintenance thereof is very costly.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the cost  of the   product   prepared  by  using   th*   conventional technology and apparatus is very high.<br>
Still    another   disadvantage    is    that decomposition of the raw material is incomplete and also<br>
th* process is time consuming.<br>
Still   another  disadvantage  is  that   the conventional   process   produces   pollution   to   the en v i r on men t.<br>
Still further disadvantage is that the  final product (compost) is of a poor quality and  contaminated with harm  and humane* pathogens which causes harm.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a process and apparatus for use for the preparation of digested organic supplement (fertilizer).<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to provide  a  process  for  the  preparation  of  digested organic  supplement (DOrS) by usinq bacteria, funqi  and other micro organism.<br>
Yet  another object of this invention  ia  to provide a  process  for  the  preparation  of  digested organic  supplement wherein the sanitary  standards  are maintained and the nitrogen conservation is high.<br>
Still another object of this invention ia to provide a process for the preparation of digeated<br>
organic supplement having maximum quantity of the nutrient like nitrogen, phosphorus and other traced<br>
elements required for the growth of the crops.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of digested orqanic<br>
supplement comprising analyzing and drying agricultural waste, crushinq the dried waste to the<br>
size of 30 to 100 mesh and feeding the waste into the bio-reactor of the device, adding selected cellulotytic<br>
bacterias  into said bio-reactor and sealing  the  same<br>
keeping said sealed bio-reactor for a period of 48 to 96 hours for the decomposition of the waste, passing  steam<br>
through   said  bio-reactor  in  order  to  sterile  the compost,  removing the composte waste from  the  reactor<br>
and  subjecting the same to the step of  homogenization, feeding the homogenized mixture into peddle mixture  and<br>
nutrients   and/or   additives  being   added   therein, operating  said  peddle  mixture for a  period  upto  45<br>
minutes and then mixture so obtained being subjected  to the step  of  pelletization or tablatinq followed by the<br>
step of drying so as to keep the moisture between 10  to 15X weight by weight.<br>

Referring to the drawings particularly fiq.l,<br>
the device for use for the preparation of digested organic supplement has a vessel /bio-reat: tor 1 for<br>
containing and decomposition of the waste therein. A plurality of wiper brush 2 are secured with a shaft 3 at<br>
equal intervals and different angles such that to remove the decomposed waste deposited on the inner<br>
valves of the vessel/bio—reactor 1 and also to agitate the waste inside the vessel .1. Shaft 3 is disposed<br>
within the vessel/bio-reactor I and the lower end of the<br>
shaft  3 is supported on a guide bush 4 provided at  the centre  of the bottom end of the  vessel/bio-reactor  1.<br>
The bottom end is dished bottom bolted to the lower  end of  the  vessel  1.  The upper end of  the  shaft  3  is<br>
connected  with  a  qear box 5  through  a  connect  and disconnect coupling.  The gear box 5 is connected with a<br>
motor 6 through a V-belt 7.  Steam inlets 8 are provided through e3nt the length of the vessel 1 for supplying the<br>
steam   into   the  vessel  1   for   facilitating   the decomposition  of lite waste contained insidn the  vessel<br>
1.  A steam outlet 9 is provided near the hot torn end  of the vessel J for draining out the steam from the  vessel<br>
1.  An outlet 10 is provided at the centre of the bottom of the vessel 1 for the exit of the decomposed  material<br>
from  the vessel 1.  A lid 11 is provided at  the  upper end of the vessel 1 for supporting the gear 5 and  motor &amp;  thereon   and  close  or seal the upper  end  of  the vessel  after  filling the vessel 1 with the  waste.   A<br>
lifting arrangement 12 is provided above the lid 11  for lifting  the lid as and when required so as to feed  the next batch of the waste into the vessel 1.<br>
According to the process the waste consisting of  agricultural  residue  (20-27.5%),  Coir  pith  (15-22.5%),  Poultry  droppings (30-37.5%),  Mushroom  Spent waste   (17.5-22.5%),   Rock  Phosphate   (2.5-4%)   and<br>
Micronutrlent (1.5-2.5%) are first dried in sun so as to have  the? moisture? ranging between 10 - 157..  The  dried<br>
waste  IB then crushed into a crusher to get  the  mixed waste  of  the "size of 60-100 mesh.  The  crushed  mixed<br>
waste  is  fed into the vessel/bio-reactor  1  and  then selected   eellulolytic  bacterias  are  put  into   the<br>
vessel/bio-rear tor.   The  upper end of  thp  vessel  is sealed and the sealed vessel i

facilitating the sterilisation  of the waste under  slow agitation.  After the step of  sterilisation  decomposed<br>
waste  is taken out and cooled.  The  cooled  decomposed waste is subjected to the step of the homogenization and<br>
the  homogenised  waste  is fed into  a  paddle  mixture<br>
wherein  the  additives are mixed  with  the  decomposed<br>
waste.    The  additives  are  for  example   biological additives   and  chemical  additives.   The   biological<br>
additives  comprises    clay,  bentonite,  kaoline   and bacteria   broth  of  nitrogen  fixure   and   phosphors<br>
solubiligers,  antagonistic fungus, rhizo  bacteria  and other bio control agents for examples bacillus  subtili»<br>
etc.    The chemical additives are trace elements  like iron,   zinc,   magness,   boron,   copper,   magnesium,<br>
molibidrum, sulphur in their salphate form. The bacteria comprises  Meaophilic  and Thermophilic  bacteria.   The<br>
fungies are Mesophilic.<br>
The  process  is further illustrated  in  the<br>
following examples:-EXAHPLE s I<br>
Agricultural residue (225 kgs), coir pith (200 kgs), poultry droppings (350 kgs), mushroom spent<br>
waste (175 kgs), rock phosphate (30 kgs) and micronutrient (20 kgs) were dried to have a moisture<br>
content of 12X. The dried mix was crushed in a crusher to get the mixture of the size of 65 mesh. The mixture<br>
BO  obtained was fed into the vessel of the  device  and<br>
the hacterias were put into the vessel.  The vessel  Mas kept  for  a period of 70 hours  for  the  decomposition<br>
purposes. Subsequently, the steam was passed through the vessel at a pressure of 20 psi and at a temperature of 120 *£ for a period of 1.75 hours in order to<br>
sterilisied  the decomposed waste.  The sterilised  waste is  fed into a paddle mixture wherein the  nutrients  20<br>
