It has been found that the compounds of general formula I are selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.<br><br>
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes (A. W. Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sri. USA 1988, 85,4934-4938) and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain (A.M. Cesura and A. Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 1992,38,171-297). Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging (C.J. Fowler et al., /. Neural. Transm. 1980,49,1-20). Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer"s disease (P. Dostert et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989,38, 555-561) and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques (Saura et al., Neuroscience 1994, 70, 755-774). In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NH3, aldehydes and H2O2, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson"s disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopaminergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer"s and Parkinson"s diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO activity and consequent increased formation of H2O2 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibitors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for example discussed by D. Bentue-Ferrer et al. in CNS Drugs 1996, 6,217-236. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications (D. M. Gardner et al., /. Clin. Psychiatry 1996,57, 99-104), these adverse events are of less concern with reversible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme.<br><br>
Object of the present invention therefore is to provide compounds which must have the criteria mentioned above. It has been found that the compounds of formula I of the present invention show the potential to be highly selective MAO-B inhibitors. Subjects of the present invention are further a process for the manufacture of compounds of formula I as well as the use of the compounds of formula I in the control or prevention of diseases mediated by monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, and, respectively, their use for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>

The compounds of general formula I can be manufactured by reacting a compound of formula<br><br>
with a compound of formula<br>
III<br>
to obtain a compound  of formula <br>
and, if desired, converting a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a possibility to prepare compounds of general formula I is shown in scheme 1: The key intermediates A are accessible through nucleophilic substitution of aromatic nitro compounds containing p-substituted leaving groups with benzylic alcohols or thiols. P- substituted leaving groups can be for example halogens (F, CI, Br, I), tosylates, mesylates or triflates. These substitution reactions can be conducted neat or in inert solvents like for example toluene or xylene. Preferred reaction temperatures are between 50° and 150 °C. Alternatively, compounds A can be prepared<br><br>
by Williamson-ether synthesis, starting from p-nitrophenols and benzylic halides, tosylates, mesylates or triflates. Bases used can be for example alcoholates or carbonates (sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate). Preferred solvents are lower alcohols, acetonitrile or lower ketones at temperatures between 20 °C and reflux temperature. Another approach is the Mitsunobu-coupling of benzylic alcohols with p-nitrophenols. The reaction is done as usual in inert solvents like for example diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, using dialkyl-azo-dicarboxylates in presence of phosphines (for example tributyl- or triphenyl-phosphine).<br>
The key intermediates A are reduced to the amino-compounds B using catalytic hydrogenation (for example Platinum on charcoal in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofurane). An alternative is the reduction of the nitro-group by metals like iron, tin, or zinc in acidic media like diluted hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. Metals can also be replaced by metal salts (for example tin-(II)-chloride).<br>
Intermediates B can be acylated by known methods to give the desired compounds I-A.These reactions can be done with acid chlorides and bases (for example trialkykmines, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate), eventually in presence of an acylation catalyst (e.g. 1 to 10 mol% of N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine) in solvents like dichloromethane, ethyl acetate or acetonitrile, preferentially at room temperature. An alternative is the well known coupling of an acid with the amine B using coupling reagents like N,N"-dicyclohexyicarbodiimide (DCC), N-(3-dimethylammopropyl)-N"-emyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) or l,l"-carbonyl-diimidazole (CDI) in solvents like dichloromethane, diethyl ether or THF, preferentially at 0 to 40 °C. Intermediates B can also primarily be monoalkylated by known methods (see for example Johnstone et al, /. Chem. Soc. (C) 1969,2233 or Krishnamurthy et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1982,23,3315) to give compounds D. These are then acylated as previously described to lead to the desired compounds I-B.<br>
Compounds with inverted ether or thioether linkers can be obtained by similar reactions, as depicted in scheme la. The key-intermediates A/ are then further transformed into the final products by the reaction sequences already mentioned in scheme 1.<br>
Additional functional group manipulations can be done by standard methods on the acylated compounds to obtain all compounds of formula I (for example: functionalising the malonic position by deprotonation and reaction with electrophiles).<br><br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, in accordance with the present invention, compounds B can also be prepared by allkylklation of N-protected p-hydroxyanilines with benzylic halides or by     Mitsunobu-coupling of N-protected p-hydroxyanilines with benzylic alcohols (scheme 2) by the methods described previously. Protective groups PG can be for example N-Boc (N-tert.-butoxycarbonyl) or N-acetyl. Deprotection of F leads to the intermediates B.<br>
Obviously, compounds with inverted ether and thioether linkers can be prepared by similar reaction sequences, inverting substituent-patterns on the aromatic moieties.<br><br>
Another method to prepare compounds of the type D or I-B involves cross-coupling reactions of arylstannanes (Lam et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 2002,43, 3091),<br><br>
arylboronates (Lam et al., Synlett2000, 5, 674); Chan et aL, Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 2933) or aryl halides (Buchwald et al., J. Amer. Che?n. Soc. 1996, 118, 7215) with the corresponding amines or amides (scheme 3).<br><br>
Once again, compounds with inverted ether and thioether linkers can be prepared by similar reaction sequences, inverting substituent-patterns on the aromatic moieties.<br>
A possibility to prepare compounds I where X is -CH2CH2- or -CH=CH- is shown in scheme 4 . Wittig- or Wittig-Horner reactions between phosphor-ylides and aromatic aldehydes under standard conditions leads to styrene-derivatives G. These intermediates can be reduced to intermediates H or I Usually, reduction of G by Bechamp-type conditions leads to compounds H, which can then be further reduced to compounds I by catalytic hydrogenation. Using harsher hydrogenation conditions, compounds G can be reduced in one step to give compound J. Compounds H or I are then further processed by the methods depicted in scheme 1 to yield the final products I. Another method to prepare compounds of the type G involves nitration of styrene-derivatives.<br><br><br>
(The compounds of formula I are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits).Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer"s disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson"s disease. Other indications include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indications may be reward deficiency syndrome (G.M. Sullivan, International patent application No. WO 01/34172 A2), peripheral neuropathy caused by cancer chemotherapy (G. Bobotas, International Patent Application No. WO 97/33572 Al), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (R.Y. Harris, International patent application No. WO 96/40095 Al) and other neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
(The compounds of formula I are especially useful for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer"s disease and senile dementia;)<br><br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNA"s encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by E.-J. Schlaeger and K. Christensen (Transient Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Grown in Serum-free Suspension Culture; Cytotechnology, 15: 1-13,1998). After transfection, cells were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 45,000 xg and, after two rinsing step with 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, membranes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80 °C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectrophotometric assay adapted from the method described by M. Zhou and N. Panchuk-Voloshina (A One-Step Fluorometric Method for the Continuous Measurement of Monoamine Oxidase Activity, Analytical Biochemistry, 253:169-174, 1997). Briefly, membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C with or without various concentrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the MAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/ml horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 uM N-acetyl-3,7,-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 (0.1 and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 U.M clorgyline for MAO-A or 10 µM L-deprenyl for MAO-B.<br>
