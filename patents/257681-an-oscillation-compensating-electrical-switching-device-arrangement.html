FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an electrical switching device arrangement having a<br>
switching section which has at least one first and one second switching point,<br>
which are electrically connected in series with one another by means of a<br>
conductor section.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An electrical switching device arrangement such as this is described, for<br>
example, in the book "Schaltgerate Grundlagen, Aufbau, Wirkungsweise",<br>
[Principles of Switching Devices, Design Method of Operation], published by<br>
Manfred Lindmayer, Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, London, Paris,<br>
Tokyo 1987, on pages 208 to 210. The switching device arrangement there has<br>
four switching sections, two of which are each supported by a separate<br>
supporting insulator. Two switching sections which are supported by different<br>
supporting insulators have mutually facing ends. In order to connect the<br>
mutually facing switching sections in series, they are electrically conductively<br>
connected by means of a conductor section.<br>
During use of the electrical switching device arrangement, external influences,<br>
for example wind, earthquakes, or else switching processes themselves, lead for<br>
example to oscillations of the electrical switching device arrangement.<br>
The previously used connection of the switching points restricts the capability of<br>
the electrical switching device arrangement to oscillate.<br><br>
GB734035 discloses improved electric switches. According to this improvement, a<br>
movable contact of a switch is connected to a fixed terminal member by a<br>
longitudinally contractible conducting member carried by a rigid insulating<br>
support and comprising a zig-zag structure built up of two or more toggle<br>
sections whereof at least the hinges are each formed by a number of superposed<br>
flexible conducting strips having their adjacent ends mechanically secured<br>
together as by blocks. The sections are joined so that the longest strip in one<br>
section faces the opposite way to the longest strip in the next section. The blocks<br>
may be grooved at to receive pins when adjacent blocks are secured together as<br>
by fish plates bolted to threaded boles. Blocks having flanges may be directly<br>
secured together by bolts. In an alternative construction the strips may be<br>
continuous from one section to the next, being gripped together at certain points<br>
so that the shortest strip in one section becomes the longest in the next and vice<br>
versa. The conducting member may be mounted between two insulating rods<br>
having longitudinal grooves which act as guides for projecting portions of pins<br>
when the member is caused to contract or expand.<br>
US4533798 describes a high-current shunt for carrying current between relatively<br>
fixed and movable terminals in a mechanism for controlling the transfer of<br>
electrical energy. In one embodiment a plurality of generally oval, flexible,<br>
ribbon-like electrical conductors are used to bridge the gap between two spaced<br>
apart coaxial base members. Each ribbon-like conductor is suspended between<br>
the two base elements so as to have a generally U-shaped configuration. By<br>
connecting the conductors to each base element at a single point, the two base<br>
elements may be rotated relative to each other to a limited degree. Stacking and<br>
nesting of the ribbon conductors increases the current carrying capability. Good<br>
electrical contact is established within a relatively small volume and relatively<br>
little force is required to rotate the two elements relative to each other.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to develop an electrical switching device<br>
arrangement of the type mentioned initially such that the switch arrangement<br>
can oscillate better.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the case of an electrical switching device arrangement of the type mentioned<br>
initially, the object is achieved according to the invention in that the conductor<br>
section has at least one first and one second very flexible conductor element,<br>
each of whose ends are attached to contact-making points of the first<br>
and of the second switching point, with the stretched length of the conductor<br>
elements being greater than a distance which runs along a straight line between<br>
the contact-making points, and with a rigid connection element connecting the<br>
flexible conductor elements to one another.<br>
The use of very flexible conductor elements, for example of a cable or a chain<br>
composed of links of electrically conductive material, such as copper, makes it<br>
possible to easily compensate for relative oscillation of the first and second<br>
switching sections of the electrical switching device arrangement with respect to<br>
one another. The choice of increased stretched length reduces the mechanical<br>
load on the very flexible conductor elements, thus ensuring a permanent<br>
electrically conductive connection. The use of the rigid connection element for<br>
the flexible conductor elements allows the movement of the conductor elements<br>
with respect to one another to be restricted. This restricts the flexibility of the<br>
individual conductor elements themselves, since they are supported with respect<br>
to one another via the connection element.<br>
In this case, it is advantageously possible to provide for the rigid connection<br>
element to be supported by the very flexible conductor elements.<br><br>
The use of the very flexible conductor elements as supporting<br>
elements for the rigid connection element means that there is<br>
no need to install additional holding apparatuses. This would<br>
represent an additional load on the electrical switching device<br>
arrangement. The this case, it is particularly advantageous for<br>
the rigid connection element to be supported exclusively by the<br>
very flexible conductor elements. Projections and edges on<br>
electrical switching device arrangements are dielectrically<br>
shielded by field control elements. The connection element and<br>
the conductor elements may be located entirely within the area<br>
of protection of the previously used field control elements.<br>
A further advantageous development makes it possible to provide<br>
for the rigid connection element to guide the very flexible<br>
conductor elements parallel to one another.<br>
Parallel guidance of a plurality of conductor elements results<br>
in the conductor elements being stabilized with respect to one<br>
another. On the basis of the parallel mounting of the conductor<br>
elements on the connection element itself, the very flexible<br>
conductor elements can be continued in different directions<br>
from the attachment points to the rigid connection element.<br>
This makes it possible to produce further arrangements which<br>
reinforce the stability of the conductor sections with respect<br>
to one another.<br>
In this case, it is also advantageously possible to provide for<br>
the conductor elements each to be bent through more than 45°,<br>
in particular through 90°, starting from the parallel guidance<br>
on the connection element, towards the contact-making points.<br>
After emerging from the rigid connection element, the very<br>
flexible conductor elements are still aligned parallel to one<br>
another, at least immediately after leaving the rigid<br><br>
connection element. Obtuse-angled bending allows the conductor<br>
elements to run along a three-dimensional path which has at<br>
least one elongated curvature. The curvature results in<br>
compensation areas, which make it possible to compensate for<br>
any relative movement between the first and the second<br>
switching point.<br>
In this case, the conductor elements may be shaped such that<br>
they are arranged laid on a path on one plane. However, they<br>
may also be laid with bends of angles through more than 45°,<br>
and in particular through 90°.<br>
A further advantageous development makes it possible to provide<br>
for the connection element to fix the very flexible conductor<br>
elements on a plane with respect to one another.<br>
The arrangement of the very flexible conductor elements on a<br>
plane on the connection element makes it possible to support<br>
bulging or bending in a specific direction in the event of the<br>
position of the switching points changing with respect to one<br>
another. A plurality of conductor elements are therefore<br>
arranged such that they lie flat alongside one another. This<br>
results in a flat ribbon arrangement. It is therefore possible<br>
to assist preferred deflection movements.<br>
A further advantageous development makes it possible to provide<br>
for at least one very flexible conductor element to be guided<br>
in a U-shape.<br>
A U-shaped position can be produced by using the force of<br>
gravity when choosing suitable contact-making points with<br>
appropriate feeding of the ends of the very flexible conductor<br>
elements to the contact-making points. The rigid connection<br>
element can then be mounted in a simple manner in the bottom<br>
area of the U. In this case, it is either possible to provide<br><br>
for a very flexible conductor element to pass completely<br>
through the rigid connection element, or for the rigid<br>
connection element to be used as a stop for the very flexible<br>
conductor elements, with a U-shaped or else some other laid<br>
shape being produced only on attachment of a plurality of<br>
conductor elements. The use of a continuous very flexible<br>
conductor element has the advantage that there is no need for<br>
additional contact points, which would increase the electrical<br>
impedance. The rigid connection element can electrically<br>
isolate the plurality of very flexible conductor elements from<br>
one another, or else can electrically conductively connect<br>
them. The use of a plurality of conductor elements which allow<br>
connection of the contact-making points only after they have<br>
been coupled via the rigid connection element has an advantage<br>
because it is possible to use short sections of conductor<br>
elements which can be combined as required and can make contact<br>
with one another via the rigid connection element. This<br>
simplifies assembly.<br>
A further advantageous development makes it possible to provide<br>
for at least one very flexible conductor element to be guided<br>
in an S-shape.<br>
S-shaped guidance of one of the very flexible conductor<br>
elements represents a further suitable shape to positively<br>
influence the oscillation behavior of an electrical switching<br>
device arrangement. It is particularly advantageous for a<br>
plurality of very flexible conductor elements to be formed in<br>
an S-shape and to be guided in opposite senses with respect to<br>
one another. On a lateral projection, because of the rigid<br>
coupling via the connection element, this results in the<br>
conductor section connecting the two switching points having a<br>
cruciform shape. A shape such as this is able to reliably<br>
absorb oscillation movements acting in different directions. By<br><br>
way of example, a cruciform shape such as this can also be<br>
achieved by arranging two U-shaped very flexible conductor<br>
elements with U-shapes pointing in opposite directions, and by<br>
coupling them by means of a rigid connection element.<br>
A further advantageous development makes it possible to provide<br>
for the very flexible conductor elements to be guided in the<br>
same way and to be arranged such that they are located one<br>
behind the other, covering one another, on a projection.<br>
An arrangement covering one another makes it possible to use a<br>
multiplicity of identical very flexible conductor elements. The<br>
physical space required is reduced by an arrangement such as<br>
this. The arrangement of a plurality of conductor elements one<br>
behind the other and covering one another in a viewing<br>
direction results in the conductor section formed from a<br>
plurality of very flexible conductor elements having a<br>
structure like a flat ribbon.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the very<br>
flexible conductor elements to be arranged with mirror-image<br>
symmetry with respect to one another on a projection.<br>
An arrangement with mirror-image symmetry makes it possible<br>
when using identical conductor elements and when they are laid<br>
in an identical manner, for example in a U-shape or in an S-<br>
shape, to produce additionally stabilizing shapes of the<br>
conductor section. Zones which intersect one another, for<br>
example, on the projection allow very flexible conductor<br>
elements to be used with a particularly long extended length in<br>
order to ensure that the electrical switching device<br>
arrangement can oscillate well. Despite the long extended<br>
lengths, the conductor section has adequate<br><br>
mechanical stability because of a rigid connection element, thus preventing<br>
uncoordinated oscillation or swinging of the very flexible conductor elements<br>
which form a part of the conductor section.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of an electrical switching device arrangement 1,<br>
partially cut away. The electrical switching device arrangement 1 has a switching<br><br>
section 2 which is formed from a first switching point 2a, a<br>
second switching point 2b, a third switching point 2c and a<br>
fourth switching point 2d. The switching points 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d<br>
are electrically connected in series with one another. This is<br>
advantageous particularly for high and very high voltages, for<br>
example for voltages of more than 480 kV, in order to ensure<br>
that the switching section 2 has an adequate withstand voltage.<br>
Two of the switching points 2a, 2d; 2b, 2c are respectively<br>
supported by a supporting insulator 3a, 3b. The switching<br>
points 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d are operated by a common drive device 4.<br>
Any movement produced by the drive device 4 is transmitted<br>
within the supporting insulators 3a, 3b to the movable contact<br>
elements of the switching points 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d.<br>
The switching points 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d are each arranged within<br>
encapsulating housings 6a, 6b. The encapsulating housings 6a,<br>
6b are manufactured in the present exemplary embodiment from<br>
insulating material, so that the electrical switching device<br>
arrangement 1 is a so-called live-tank switch. The interior of<br>
the encapsulation housings 6a, 6b is in each case filled with a<br>
pressurized insulating gas, for example sulfurhexafluoride,<br>
nitrogen or mixtures of gases such as these. The mutually<br>
facing ends of the first and second switching points 2a, 2b are<br>
electrically conductively connected to one another by means of<br>
a conductor section 5. Connection options for electrical power<br>
transmission devices, such as lines or cables, are in each case<br>
arranged at the mutually averted ends of the third and fourth<br>
switching points 2c, 2d.<br>
Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 illustrate the various development<br>
variants of the conductor section 5.<br><br>
Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 each show the mutually facing ends of<br>
the first and second switching points 2a, 2b. The encapsulating<br>
housings 6a, 6b which surround the switching points 2a, 2b are<br>
essentially designed to be hollow and cylindrical, and are<br>
closed in a gas-tight manner at the end faces of the fitting<br>
bodies 7a, 7b. The fitting bodies 7a, 7b are manufactured from<br>
an electrically conductive material and are part of the current<br>
path which can be switched by means of the switching section 2.<br>
The fitting bodies 7a, 7b which are associated with the<br>
respective housings 6a, 6b are electrically conductively<br>
connected to the respective first and second switching points<br>
2a, 2b. The fitting bodies 7a, 7b have respective connecting<br>
terminals 8a, 8b. The connecting terminals 8a, 8b are each<br>
formed from half-shells, between which an electrical conductor<br>
can be clamped in by the application of external clamping<br>
forces, and can have electrical contact made with it. Clamping-<br>
in holders for the connecting terminals 8a, 8b have an<br>
essentially cylindrical shape, into which a conductor element<br>
provided with a cylindrical external contour can be inserted.<br>
The connecting terminals 8a, 8b represent contact-making<br>
points. The position of the clamping-in holders in the<br>
connecting terminals 8a, 8b is chosen such that their axial<br>
alignment, which is governed by the cylindrical shape, is<br>
arranged transversely with respect to an axis running between<br>
the first and the second switching point to 2a, 2b. A first<br>
very flexible conductor element 9 is inserted into and braced<br>
in the fitting bodies 8a, 8b. The very flexible conductor<br>
element 9 is in the form of an electrically conductive cable,<br>
with the ends of the conductor element 9 each being inserted<br>
from the same direction into the clamping-in holders of the<br>
connecting terminals 8a, 8b. In consequence, the very flexible<br>
conductor element 9 is U-shaped.<br>
A rigid connection element 10 is arranged in the central area<br>
of the very flexible conductor element 9. The rigid connection<br><br>
element 10 is used to couple a plurality of very flexible<br>
conductor elements.<br><br>
which are located one behind the other, covering one another,<br>
in the present exemplary embodiment, and are arranged<br>
identically, at a rigid angle.<br>
By way of example, figure 7 shows a rigid connection element<br>
10. The rigid connection element 10 has a first half-shell 10a<br>
and a second half-shell 10b, which can be pressed onto one<br>
another. In the contact area between two surfaces of the half-<br>
shells 10a, 10b, cylindrical recesses are formed, into which<br>
very flexible conductor elements can be inserted, so that they<br>
are guided parallel in the area of the rigid connection element<br>
10. The sizes of the recesses are in this case chosen such that<br>
the very flexible conductor elements are braced in the rigid<br>
connection element 10 so the two half-shells 10a, 10b are<br>
pressed together. In the present example, the rigid connection<br>
element 10 which is illustrated in figure 7 is used to couple<br>
three very flexible conductor elements.<br>
The rigid connection element 10 may be designed such that it<br>
allows electrical contact to be made with the very flexible<br>
conductor elements 9 which have been inserted into the<br>
recesses. However, it can also be designed so as to allow the<br>
very flexible conductor elements 9, which are jointly<br>
surrounded by the rigid connection element 10, to be held in an<br>
insulated manner. Depending on the currents to be transmitted,<br>
the number of very flexible conductor elements 9 which are<br>
braced in one rigid connection element 10 may vary. The number<br>
can be matched appropriately to the recess for holding the very<br>
flexible conductor elements 9.<br>
Since the first and the second switching point 2a, 2b, as well<br>
as the encapsulating housings 6a, 6b, the fitting bodies 7a, 7b<br>
and the connecting terminals 8a, 8b are in each case of<br>
identical design,<br><br>
only the conductor sections 5, which are designed differently<br>
to one another, would in each case be explained in the<br>
description of the following embodiment variants.<br>
Figure 3 shows a conductor section 5 designed such that a first<br>
very flexible conductor element 9a is laid in a U-shape, and a<br>
second very flexible conductor element 9b is likewise laid in a<br>
U-shape. However, the two very flexible conductor elements 9a,<br>
9b are arranged with mirror-image symmetry with respect to one<br>
another, with the mirror-image axis being arranged parallel to<br>
an axis which extends between the switching points 2a, 2b. A<br>
known form of connecting terminals 8a, 8b is in each case<br>
provided for attachment of the first and of the second<br>
respective very flexible conductor elements 9a, 9b, with the<br>
connecting terminals 8a, 8b associated with the first very<br>
flexible conductor element 9a in each case holding the very<br>
flexible conductor element 9a, coming from the same direction.<br>
The connecting terminals 8a, 8b which are associated with the<br>
second very flexible conductor element 9b hold the ends of the<br>
second very flexible conductor element 9b, likewise from the<br>
same direction, with this running in the opposite direction<br>
sense with respect to the insertion direction of the first very<br>
flexible conductor element 9a to its associated connecting<br>
terminals 8a, 8b (with mirror-image symmetry). A rigid<br>
connection element 10 is once again provided in the central<br>
area of the first and of the second very flexible conductor<br>
element 9a, 9b and connects a plurality of conductor elements,<br>
in the present case two conductor elements, to one another at a<br>
rigid angle, one behind the other with respect to the plane of<br>
the drawing. On the projection, this therefore results in a<br>
cruciform conductor section 5 which is formed from<br>
intrinsically very flexible conductor elements and, as a result<br>
of being clamped in at the connecting terminals 8a, 8b and as a<br>
result of the rigid connection element 10 and the way in which<br>
the very flexible conductor elements 9a, 9b<br><br>
are laid, this represents a comparatively rigid structure, but<br>
which can compensate for oscillations.<br>
The first and the second very flexible conductor elements 9a,<br>
9b are guided approximately parallel to one another on a plane<br>
on the rigid connection element 10. The first and the second<br>
very flexible conductor elements 9a, 9b are also guided<br>
approximately parallel in the immediate inlet and outlet area<br>
of the rigid connection element 10. After emerging from the<br>
rigid connection element 10, the very flexible conductor<br>
elements 9a, 9b are each bent through 90°, with the conductor<br>
elements 9a, 9b each being bent in the same direction,<br>
therefore in each case resulting in a U-shaped profile.<br>
However, it is also possible to use other angles which are in<br>
each case greater than 45°. The individual sections of the very<br>
flexible conductor elements can also be deflected such that the<br>
conductor elements 9 can emerge from a plane as well, and can<br>
extend into a space.<br>
Figure 4 shows an alternative to the exemplary embodiment of a<br>
conductor section 5 illustrated in figure 3. The conductor<br>
section 5 is once again formed from a plurality of very<br>
flexible conductor elements 9c, 9d. However, one development<br>
variant of a rigid connection element 10 is designed such that,<br>
on the projection shown in figure 4, there is no overlap<br>
between the laying paths of the very flexible conductor<br>
elements 9c, 9d, although they are designed with mirror-image<br>
symmetry. When using exclusively two very flexible conductor<br>
elements 9c, 9d these also lie on one and the same plane.<br>
However, if provision is made for further very flexible<br>
conductor elements to be located, covering one another, behind<br>
the very flexible conductor elements 9c, 9d which can be seen<br>
in figure 4, then the conductor elements run on two planes in<br>
the area of the<br><br>
rigid connection element 10a, with the planes being aligned<br>
approximately parallel, but at a distance from one another.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further development variant of a conductor<br>
section 5, in which a further very flexible conductor element<br>
9e is laid in an S-shape. For this purpose, the connecting<br>
terminals 8a, 8b are separated from one another such that the<br>
further very flexible conductor element 9e is in each case<br>
introduced into the connecting terminals 8a, 8b from opposite<br>
directions. A plurality of further very flexible conductor<br>
elements 9e which are arranged located one behind the other,<br>
covering one another, are coupled to one another by a rigid<br>
connection element 10.<br>
Figure 6 shows a development variant of the conductor section 5<br>
illustrated in figure 5. A further very flexible conductor<br>
element 9e and a very flexible conductor element 9f are each<br>
bent in an S-shape and have an identical bent shape, but the<br>
deflection directions of the S-curves are aligned in opposite<br>
senses (with mirror-image symmetry), thus resulting in the<br>
conductor elements 9e, 9f crossing over on a projection<br>
illustrated in figure 6. These elements are stabilized in the<br>
central area of a rigid connection element 10. This once again<br>
results in a cruciform connection being formed between the<br>
contacts of the first and of the second switching point 2a, 2b,<br>
which can absorb oscillations with adequate mechanical<br>
stability.<br>
Sections of the very flexible conductor elements which run in a<br>
curved shape, preferably bent through 90°, are in each case<br>
formed between the individual connecting terminals and the<br>
rigid connection element of the exemplary embodiments. Since a<br>
direction change in the profile of a very flexible conductor<br>
element in each case runs between two stabilizing clamping-in<br>
points, this results in a conductor section with elastic<br><br>
characteristics, which can absorb external oscillation<br>
phenomena. Crossing and coincident conductor elements can<br>
therefore advantageously support one another.<br><br>
