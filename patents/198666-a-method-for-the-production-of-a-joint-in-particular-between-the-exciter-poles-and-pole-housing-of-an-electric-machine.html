ROBERT BOSCH GMBH, 70442 OtuttyarL<br>
Method for the production of a joint, in particular between the exciter poles and pole housing of an electric machine, atid machine produced in accordance with the method<br>
The invention relates to a method for the produc¬tion of a joint, in particular between the exciter poles and pole housing of an electric machine, having the features cited in the preamble of Claim 1, and also to an electric machine produced in accordance therewith.<br>
Prior art<br>
In the case of electric machines having electri¬cal excitation, it is known to fix the exciter poles carrying the exciter winding to the inside of a pole housing having an essentially cylindrical design. It is known that the exciter poles can be fixed to the pole housing by means of a screwed connection, a welded connection or an adhesive bond, for exeunple. Further¬more, FR-A 2 488 749 discloses a method in which exciter poles are fixed to the pole housing by means of a force-locking joint, material of the pole housing being dis¬placed into a conical recess in the exciter poles. It is disadvantageous in this case that the conical recesses can be produced only at very great effort using precision tools. In order to ensure that the material of the pole housing is reliatbly displaced evenly into the conical recess, which widens towards the bottom, in the exciter poles, it is necessary to adjust the joining tools with respect to the recess in a highly precise manner which therefore requires a great deal of effort.<br><br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
In contrast, the method according to the invention having the features cited in Claim 1 makes it possible to provide, in a simple manner, a positively and force-looking connection between the exciter poles and the poles housing, in which a secondary air gap between the exciter poles and the pole housing is restricted to a minimum. Since the material of the pole housing and of the respective exciter pole is displaced by the joining tool at points at at least one joining site into a corresponding recess in the exciter pole, it is possible to achieve a force-locking connection between the exciter poles and the pole housing by means of simple method steps which, furthermore, can be carried out by means of a tool having a simple structure. High joining forces are applied which ensure that the exciter poles bear extensively against the pole housing. By introducing the high joining forces, the gap between the exciter poles and the pole housing is limited to its possible technical minimum. Displacing the material of the pole housing only at points into a corresponding recess in the exciter poles ensures that the material loss of the exciter poles is extremely small, with the result that it is possible essentially to preclude any adverse effect on these electromagnetic properties.<br>
Advantages refinements of the invention emerge from the features cited in the subclaims.<br>
Accordingly the present intention provides a method for the production of a joint, in particular between the exciter poles and pole housing of an electric machine, a joining force being exerted on the joining site by means of a joining tool and, as a result, a positively- and force-locking connection being produced by material of the pole housing in each case being displaced into a recess in the exciter poles, characterized in that the material of the pole housing and of the respective exciter pole is displaced by the joining tool at points at least one joining site into a corresponding recess in the exciter pole.<br>
Drawings<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below using exemplary embodiments with reference to the associated drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic sectional view through a connection site between an exciter pole and a pole housing prior to joining;<br>
Figure 2 shows the connection site according to figure 1 after joining;<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a microsection or the joining site accord¬ing to the invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows a connection site prior to joining in accordance with a further exemplary embodiment; Figure 5 shows the connection site according to figure 4 after joining;<br>
Figure 6 shows a connection site after joining in accord¬ance with a further exemplary embodiment, and Figure 7 shows a sectional view of an exciter pole according to a further exemplary embodiment.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
Figure 1 partially shows, in a sectional view, a pole housing 10 and an exciter pole 12 of an electric machine which is not illustrated overall. The electric machine generally has four or six exciter poles 12, which are arranged over the internal periphery of the pole housing 10 having a cylindrical design. The method for the production of a joint between the pole housing 10 and the exciter poles 12 will be explained with reference to the partial illustration of an exciter pole 12. The exciter poles 12 are in this case arranged over the periphery of a mandrel 14, which is a component part of a joining apparatus. The exciter poles 12 have previously been provided with the exciter windings (not illustrated here) and suitably locked in place over the periphery of the mandrel 14. The mandrel 14 with the exciter poles 12 is then moved into the pole housing 10. In this case, both a relative movement of the mandrel 14 with the exciter poles 12 with respect to the pole housing 10 and/or a relative movement of the pole housing 10 with respect to exciter poles 12 which are fixed in position can be effected. The joining apparatus further¬more has a tool holder 16, which has at least one tool guide 18 for a joining tool 20. A joining force F can be applied to the joining tool 2 0 by means of a suitable apparatus, for example a hydraulic or pneumatic appara¬tus.<br><br>
Positioning of the pole housing 10 and/or of the mandrel 14 with the exciter poles 12 is carried out in such a way that a recess 22 made beforehand in the exciter poles 12 is assigned to each joining tool 20. In accordance with a preferred exemplary embodiment, the joining tool 20 is a circular punch, to which, therefore, a corresponding hole 24 (recess 22) is assigned. In this case, the hole 24 can be designed - as illustrated in Figure 1 - as a through hole and, in accordance with a further exemplary embodiment, as a blind hole. Moreover, in accordance with exemplary embodiments which are not illustrated, the mutually corresponding contours of the joining tool 20 and of the recess 22 can depart from a circular form. Oval or angular cross-sections are thus possible, for example. Furthermore, a plurality of recesses 22 can be provided for each exciter pole 12, which recesses are then arranged, for example, axially spaced apart from one another. For a design of this type, the joining apparatus then has a corresponding number of joining tools 20.<br>
The joining tool 20 has a two-tier desigrn, that is to say it has a first section 26 of smaller diameter and an adjoining section 2 8 of larger dieuneter. The sections 26 and 28 merge into one another via an annular step 30. In the example shown, the annular step 30 is arranged at right angles to the action of the joining force F. In accordance with further exemplary embodi¬ments which are not illustrated, the annular step 30 can have a conical profile.<br>
After the positioning of the exciter pole 12 and/or of the pole housing 10, the joining force F is applied to the joining tool 20. In this case, the pole housing 10 is pressed against the exciter poles 12. The mandrel 14 serves as an abutment for the joining force F. In a first method step, the section 26 of the joining tool 20 touches the pole housing 10 and in doing so displaces - corresponding to the dimensioning of the section 26 - a specific eunount of material of the pole housing 10 into the recess 22 situated opposite to the<br><br>
joining tool 20. By maintaining the joining force F, the annular step 30 comes into contact with the pole housing 10, with the result that the joining force F is now introduced into the pole housing 10 via the section 28 of the larger diameter. An additional areal pressure is thus produced - corresponding to the size of the annular step 30 - on the pole housing 10, with the result that an upper edge 32 of the recess 22 is forced into the recess 24 iinder the joining force F. The result of the edge 32 being forced into the recess 22 is, as shown more closely by Figure 2, that the material which has previously been displaced by means of the section 26 of the joining tool 20 and forms a rivet 34 is undercut. With reference to the finished joint illustrated in Figure 2, it becomes clear that the rivet 34 displaced from the material of the pole housing 10 is fixedly clamped in by means of the undercut 33 of the edge 32, which consists of the material of the exciter pole 12. The exciter poles 12 are forced in the direction of the pole housing 10 by the high forces occurring during the joining operation according to the invention, with the result that a gap 35 remaining between the exciter poles 12 and the pole housing 10 remains restricted to its technical minimum.<br>
The positively- and force-locking connection between the exciter poles 12 and the pole housing 10 is permanently retained even following removal from the joining apparatus. As a result of the, for example, circular design of the recess 22 and of the joining tool 20, the rivet 34 is constricted, that is to say undercut, on a peripheral line along the edge 32. Consequently, it is also possible reliably to absorb forces acting in the axial direction of the exciter poles while the electric machine is being used as intended, without the gap 35 being loosened and hence enlarged. A reliable and fixed connection can be permanently ensured in accordance with the number of selected connection sites between an exciter pole 12 and the pole housing 10.<br>
The microsection,  shown in Figure 3,  of the connection site between the pole housing 10 and the<br><br>
exciter pole 12 illustrates the xandercutting of ttie eage 32 of the rivet 34 displaced from the material of the pole housing 10 into the recess 22.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show a further embodiment variant for the production of a joint between the exciter pole 12 and the pole housing 10. Parts identical to those in Figure 1 are provided with the same reference symbols and are not explained again. The illustration of the joining apparatus has been omitted for reasons of clarity. With reference to Figure 5,' it becomes clear that the recess 22 can be designed as a blind hole 36. The blind hole 36 can very advantageously be made by means of a so-called bowl in the exciter pole 12, the edge 32 simultaneously being thrown up as a bead 38 circumscribing the recess 22.<br>
With reference to the joint between the pole housing 10 and the exciter pole 12 shown in Figure 4, it becomes clear that during the joining operation, it being possible here for the joining operation to be carried out using a single-tier embossing punch 20a, the bead 38 is forced into the recess 22 by the joining force F, with the result that the rivet 34 displaced by the joining tool into the recess 22 is likewise constricted or undercut by the edge 32 of the exciter pole 12. Consequently, a permanent positively- and force-locking connection between the exciter poles 12 and the pole housing 10 is likewise possible. The rivet 34 is fixedly clamped in by the undercut 33, a tensile force between the pole housing 10 and the exciter poles 12 likewise being established, with the result that the gap 35 remains restricted to its minimum. The production of secondary air gaps is consequently avoided.<br>
Figure 6 shows a diagrammatic view through a further joint. Identical parts are once again provided with identical reference symbols and are not explained again. In the exemplary embodiment shown here, the recess 22 of the exciter pole 12 is once again designed as a through hole. During the joining operation which has been explained with reference to Figures 1 to 3, a<br><br>
counterpunch 40, which has a conical chamfer 42 at its end facing the pole housing 10, is held during the action of the joining force F in the recess 22. The effect achieved by this is that during the joining operation, the material of the pole housing 10 which produces the rivet 34 and is displaced into the recess 22 runs into the conical surface 42 of the counterpunch 40 and is laterally displaced. The undercut 33 is likewise formed as a result of this and ensures a reliable positively-and force-locking connection between the exciter pole and the pole housing 10.<br>
Figure 7 shows a further embodiment variant of the recess 22 of the exciter pole 12. For the purpose of illustration, only the exciter pole 12 is shown in a sectional view in this case. The recess 22 is designed as a stepped hole 44 which, at its end facing the pole housing 10, merges with a section of smaller diauneter via a step 46. The effect achieved by this is that the displaced material of the pole housing 10 which produces the rivet 34 is displaced under the step 46 when it rtms into a counterpunch (not illustrated here), with the result that an undercut 33 is once again produced.<br>
Overall, it becomes clear that the feature shared by all of the exemplary embodiments is that a simple and permanent joint between the exciter poles 12 and the pole housing 10 can be produced by means of a so-called embossing- or punching-riveting operation which is simple in its implementation, which joint is permanently positively- and force-locking particularly as a result of the formation of an imdercut 33. The formation of the \indercut 33 can in this case be achieved both by means of a particular design of the recess 22 and/or of the joining tool 20. In all of the embodiments, the joint is produced in a both force- and positively-locking manner with just one work stroke of the joining tool designed as an embossing punch.<br><br><br>
