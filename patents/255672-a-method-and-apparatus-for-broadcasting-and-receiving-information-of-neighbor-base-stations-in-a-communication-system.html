				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FORMING AND<br>
TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING NEIGHBOR BASE STATION<br>
INFORMATION IN A BWA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA)<br>
communication system, and more particularly to a method and a system for<br>
forming and transmitting/receiving neighbor Base Station (BS) information in<br>
order for a serving BS to send the neighbor BS information to a Mobile Station<br>
(MS) in a BWA communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The communication system was initially developed for the purpose of<br>
voice service and is now being developed to provide data service and various<br>
multimedia services. However, the communication system developed for voice<br>
service has a relatively narrow bandwidth for data transmission and requires<br>
relatively expensive service charges, it cannot meet rapidly increasing user<br>
demands for various services. Further, the necessity for a communication system<br>
capable of efficiently providing Internet service is now increasing due to<br>
increasing demands for the Internet service together with the development in the<br>
communication industry. To this end, a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA)<br>
communication system, which has a broad enough bandwidth to meet rapidly<br>
increasing user demands and efficiently provide the Internet service, has been<br>
introduced.<br>
The BWA communication system is a communication system for<br>
supporting not only the voice service but also various data services of low and<br>
high speed and multimedia application services for providing high quality moving<br>
images, etc. The BWA communication system supports access to the Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), Packet Switched Data Network (PSDN),<br>
Internet network, International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT)-2000 network,<br>
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, etc. in a mobile or stationary<br>
environment based on wireless media using a broadband, and supports a high<br>
speed channel data rate. The BWA communication system can be classified into a<br>
broadband wireless subscriber network, a broadband mobile access network, and<br>
high speed wireless Local Area Network (LAN), according to the mobility<br>
(stationary or mobile) of a Subscriber Station (SS), the communication<br><br>
environment (outdoor or indoor), and the channel data rate.<br>
Meanwhile, 802.16 standardization group of Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which is one of international standardization<br>
organizations, is arranging standards for wireless access schemes of the BWA<br>
communication system, and specifically, is now driving to establish an IEEE<br>
802.16d standard for providing a broadband wireless Internet service to a<br>
stationary SS. The 802.16 system does not account for the mobility of the SS.<br>
A BWA system according to the IEEE 802.16d standard has a wider<br>
bandwidth for data transmission and thus can transmit a much larger quantity of<br>
data in a short time, in comparison with the conventional wireless technology for<br>
voice service. Further, in the BWA system according to the IEEE 802.16d<br>
standard, all of the users can share a channel, thereby achieving efficient use of<br>
the channel. Further, the BWA system according to the IEEE 802.16d standard<br>
can guarantee various Quality of Service (QoS) and thus can provide a user with<br>
services of different qualities according to the characteristics of service. In the<br>
IEEE 802.16d system, all of the users connected to the BS share a common<br>
channel, so the BS allocates intervals of the common channel for use by each user<br>
during every uplink and downlink frame. Therefore, the BS must send uplink and<br>
downlink access information to the users every frame in order to enable the users<br>
to share the channel. To this end, in the IEEE 802.16d system, channels are<br>
divided into uplink channel and downlink channel, information about each<br>
channel is defined according to Type, Length and Value (TLV), and the defined<br>
information is then inserted to Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) and Uplink<br>
Channel Descriptor (UCD) messages which are transmitted to all of the users, so<br>
that characteristic information about the channels is sent to the SS.<br>
Further, the IEEE 802.16 standardization group is now driving to<br>
establish an IEEE 802.16e standard for providing mobility to an SS of the IEEE<br>
802.16d communication system. The IEEE 802.16e communication system has a<br>
wider bandwidth for data transmission and thus can transmit a much larger<br>
quantity of data in short time, in comparison with the conventional wireless<br>
technology for voice service. Further, in the IEEE 802.16e communication system,<br>
all of the users can share a channel, thereby achieving efficient use of the channel.<br>
Also, the IEEE 802.16e communication system can guarantee various Quality of<br>
Service (QoS) and thus can provide a user with services of difference qualities<br>
according to the characteristics of service. The IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system supports handoff, thereby guaranteeing the mobility of a Mobile Station<br>
(MS).<br>
In order to support the mobility of an MS, a BS of the IEEE 802.16e<br><br>
communication system periodically broadcasts a mobile neighbor advertisement<br>
(MOBNBR-ADV) message that includes neighbor BS information to all MSs<br>
within a cell controlled by the BS, thereby sending status information of the<br>
neighbor cells to the MSs. Specifically, when an MS located within one cell<br>
moves to a neighbor cell, the MS can preliminarily obtain information of a<br>
neighbor BS of the neighbor cell (i.e. a BS controlling the neighbor cell), such as<br>
a network ID, channel characteristics, etc. of the neighbor BS, by receiving the<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message broadcast by the serving BS which controls the<br>
current cell in which the MS is currently located. Therefore, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system can support handoff of the MS.<br>
However, in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, when the serving<br>
BS has too many neighbor cells or the neighbor cells have capacities much<br>
different from the capacity of the current cell, the quantity of the neighbor BS<br>
information transmitted from the serving BS to the MSs becomes too much, so<br>
that the MOB_NBR-ADV message transmitted from the serving BS to the MSs<br>
becomes too large. When the serving BS has too much neighbor BS information,<br>
it is impossible to transmit all of the information in one frame. In other words, the<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message including all the neighbor BS information becomes<br>
too large and thus cannot be transmitted in one frame. In the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, a BS cannot fragment a Medium Access Control (MAC)<br>
management message to transmit the message.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the<br>
present invention rather unclear.<br>
As described here, the present invention proposes a method and system<br>
for forming a broadcast message, specifically a mobile neighbor advertisement<br>
(MOBNBR-ADV) message, for transmitting neighbor BS information from a<br>
serving BS (a BS currently providing service to an MS) to the MS in order to<br>
support handoff of the MS in a BWA communication system. Further, the present<br>
invention proposes a method and system for transmitting and receiving the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message including the neighbor BS information in a BWA<br>
communication system. The present invention proposes a method and system for<br>
constructing a MOBNBR-ADV message through fragmentation and then<br><br>
transmitting the constructed MOBNBR-ADV message to an MS, when the<br>
serving BS has too much neighbor BS information to transmit to the MS and thus<br>
the MOB_NBR-ADV message to be transmitted to the MS is too large. Also, the<br>
present invention can be applied to formation and transmission of all broadcast<br>
messages exchanged between a BS and an MS as well as the MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
message.<br>
For convenience, the following description is based on an assumption that<br>
a BWA communication system according to preferred embodiments of the present<br>
. invention is an IEEE 802.16e communication system which uses an Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme. Because the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system uses an OFDM/OFDMA scheme, it can transmit physical<br>
channel signals by using a plurality of sub-carriers, thereby achieving high speed<br>
data transmission. Also, the IEEE 802.16e communication system supports a<br>
multi-cell structure and the mobility of an MS.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a BWA communication system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention, which supports handoff of an MS<br>
moving between cells controlled by BSs supporting different operation modes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the BWA communication system has a multi-cell<br>
structure including cell 1 101, cell 2 103, cell 3 105, cell 4 107, cell 5 109, cell 6<br>
111, and cell 7 113. Also, the BWA communication system includes BSs 121, 123,<br>
125, 127, 129, 131, 133 and an MS 150. The BSs 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131,<br>
133 control the cells 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, respectively. The MS 150<br>
can receive services from the BSs 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133 while<br>
moving between the cells 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113. The signal exchange<br>
between the MS 150 and the BSs 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133 uses the<br>
OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br>
When the MS 150 moves from cell 1 101 controlled by BS 1 121 to cell 2<br>
103 controlled by BS 2 123, the serving BS (the BS which is currently providing<br>
a service to the MS 150) changes from BS 1 121 to BS 2 123, and BS 1 121 (the<br>
current serving BS) broadcasts a MOBNBR-ADV message that includes BS<br>
information of neighbor cells to the MS 150. Upon receiving the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message, the MS 150 obtains the BS information of neighbor cells in<br>
advance. Then, as soon as the MS 150 gets the channel information of BS 2 123,<br>
the MS 150 starts a process for setting up a connection with BS 2 123, thereby<br>
performing a handoff process. That is, BS 1 121 (the current serving BS)<br>
broadcasts a MOBNBR-ADV message in order to preliminarily send neighbor<br>
BS information (i.e. information of BS 2 123) to the MS 150 moving to cell 2 103,<br><br>
and the MS 150 recognizes the information of BS 2 123 from the received<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message. As a result, the BWA communication system<br>
supports handoff of the MS 150.<br>
In a BWA communication system having the structure described above,<br>
the serving BS inserts the neighbor BS information in the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message in order to transmit the neighbor BS information to the MS. Table 1<br>
below shows the format of the MOBNBR-ADV message.<br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the MOB_NBR-ADV message includes a plurality<br>
of Information Elements (IEs), which include a 'Management Message Type'<br>
field of 8 bits which represents the type of transmitted/received message<br>
(Management Message Type = 49), an 'Operator ID' field of 24 bits which is<br>
assigned for identification of an operator, represents an identifier (ID) of the<br>
operator, and can be shared by a group of BSs, an 'NNEIGHBOR' field of 8 bits<br><br>
which represents the number of neighbor BSs, an 'HMAC Tuple' field of 21 bits,<br>
and information of all of the neighbor BSs. Further, the MOB NBR-ADV<br>
message includes a 'Fragmentation Index' field and a 'Total Fragmentation' field,<br>
each of which has a size of 4 bits and represents 'Neighbor Set' of neighbor BSs.<br>
That is, the 'Neighbor Set' field of the neighbor BSs is divided into the<br>
'Fragmentation Index' field of 4 bits, which represents an index of the current<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message transmitted by the current frame among<br>
all of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages, and the 'Total Fragmentation'<br>
field which represents the number of all of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
messages, i.e. the number of all fragments divided from the entire MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a format of a MOBNBR-ADV message including the<br>
newly added fragmentation information described above, i.e. the 'Fragmentation<br>
Index' field representing an index of the currently transmitted fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message and the 'Total Fragmentation' field representing the<br>
number of all the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages. Referring to FIG. 2,<br>
when the serving BS has too much neighbor BS information and a MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message which cannot be transmitted in one frame, the serving BS divides<br>
the MOBNBR-ADV message into fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages of a<br>
size which can be carried by one frame, inserts the number of all of the<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages into the 'Total Fragmentation' field and<br>
an index of a fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV message transmitted by a current<br>
frame into the 'Fragmentation Index' field, and then transmits the information-<br>
inserted message. When the MOBNBR-ADV message has been divided into<br>
more than one fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message, the serving BS<br>
sequentially transmits to the MS all of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
messages by corresponding frames. In this case, the 'Fragmentation Index' field<br>
represents indices of neighbor BSs also included in the fragmented MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message transmitted by the current frame, so that the MS can differentiate<br>
the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message transmitted by the current frame from<br>
the other fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages. Further, because the 'Total<br>
Fragmentation' field represents the number of all of the fragmented MOBNBR-<br>
ADV messages transmitted to the MS, the MS can determine if there is any more<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message to be transmitted by another frame after<br>
the current frame. Through the 'Total Fragmentation' field, the MS can<br>
recognize the number of frames for carrying the entire MOBNBR-ADV message<br>
and can receive all of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages transmitted<br>
through the corresponding number of frames, thereby acquiring the information<br><br>
of all of the neighbor BSs.<br>
Further, the 'N_NEIGHBORS' field includes a 'Neighbor BS ID' field of<br>
48 bits representing IDs of the neighbor BSs, a 'PHY Profile ID' field of 32 bits<br>
representing downlink physical frequencies of the neighbor BSs, a 'Configuration<br>
Change Count' field of 8 bits representing a change count for the configuration of<br>
the MOBNBR-ADV message, and a 'TLV Encoded Neighbor information' field<br>
of variable bits representing TLV-encoded information of the neighbor BSs.<br>
In a BWA communication system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the MS can obtain information of neighbor BSs by receiving<br>
the MOBNBR-ADV message including the field as described above from the<br>
serving BS, and the MS can easily perform handoff when moving to another cell<br>
because the MS preliminarily obtains information of the BS controlling the other<br>
cell to which the MS will move. Therefore, the BWA communication system<br>
according to the present invention supports handoff of an MS. Further, in the<br>
BWA communication system, the MOB_NBR-ADV message includes the<br>
'Fragmentation Index' field and the 'Total Fragmentation' field. Therefore, when<br>
the MOBNBR-ADV message is too large to be sent to the MS in one frame, the<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message is divided into fragmented messages each having a<br>
size transmittable in one frame, so that the fragmented messages can be<br>
transmitted to the MS in more than one frame. Therefore, according to the present<br>
invention, even when the serving BS has too much neighbor BS information and<br>
a MOBNBR-ADV message is to large to transmit, the serving BS can fragment<br>
the MOBNBR-ADV message and then transmit the fragmented MOBNBR-<br>
ADV messages to the MS and the MS can preliminarily get the neighbor BS<br>
information by receiving the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages.<br>
Table 2 shows a format of the MOBNBR-ADV message including<br>
information of neighbor BSs transmitted from a serving BS to an MS in a BWA<br>
communication system according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the MOBNBR-ADV message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, which include a 'Management Message Type' field of 8 bits which<br>
represents the type of transmitted/received message (Management Message Type<br>
= 49), an 'Operator ID' field of 24 bits which is assigned for identification of an<br>
operator, represents an identifier (ID) of the operator, and can be shared by a<br>
group of BSs, a 'Configuration Change Count' field of 8 bits representing a<br>
change count for the configuration of the MOBNBR-ADV message, and a 'PHY<br>
Profile ID' field which represents physical layer information of the BS and<br>
includes a Co-located FA indicator bit, an FA Configuration indicator bit, a<br>
Time/Frequency Synchronization Indicator, a BS EIRP Indicator, a DCD/UCD<br>
Reference Indicator, an FA Index Indicator and an FA number.<br>
When the MOB_NBR-ADV message having the format as described<br>
above is too large to be transmitted in one frame, that is, when it is impossible to<br>
transmit all of the neighbor BS information in one frame, the serving BS may<br>
divide the MOB_NBR-ADV message into fragmented messages each having a<br>
size transmittable in one frame in order to transmit the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message to the MS. Further, when the MOBNBR-ADV message is transmitted<br>
to the MS after being fragmented, each transmitted fragment of the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message must indicate that the MOBNBR-ADV message has been<br>
fragmented. Also, when the MS has received one fragment of the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message indicating that the MOBNBR-ADV message has been<br>
fragmented, the MS can receive directly after the first fragment information of all<br>
of the neighbor BSs by receiving all of the other fragments of the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message transmitted by the frames.<br>
In order to indicate that the MOB_NBR-ADV message has been<br>
fragmented, it is necessary for the MOBNBR-ADV message to include the<br>
following fields. That is, the MOBNBR-ADV message includes a<br>
'Fragmentation Mode' field of 1 bit representing the fragmentation mode, a<br>
'TOT_N_NEIGHBORS' field of 7 bits representing the number of all of the<br>
neighbor BSs, a 'Start bit' field of 1 bit representing the start bit of the fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message, and a 'Number of Remaining Fragments' field of 6<br>
bits representing the number of remaining fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
messages to be transmitted by frames directly after the frame carrying the very<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message.<br>
By the above-mentioned fields, it is noted that the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message can be fragmented according to two types of fragmentation modes. The<br><br>
'Fragmentation Mode' field of the MOBNBR-ADV message represents the type<br>
of indicating the fragmentation of the MOB_NBR-ADV message. When the<br>
fragmentation of the MOB_NBR-ADV message is expressed by the number of all<br>
of the neighbor BSs, i.e. by the quantity of neighbor BS information, the<br>
indication type is expressed in the 'TOT_N_NEIGHBORS' field and the<br>
'Fragmentation Mode' field is set to '1'. Further, when the fragmentation of the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message is expressed by the number of the fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV messages, the 'Fragmentation Mode' field is set to '0'.<br>
When the 'Fragmentation Mode' field has been set to '1', the<br>
'TOT_N_NEIGHBORS' field represents the number of all of the neighbor BSs to<br>
which the serving BS broadcasts the MOBNBR-ADV message, and the<br>
'N_NEIGHBORS' field of 8 bits represents the number of the neighbor BSs of<br>
which BS information is transmitted by the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message, i.e. the quantity of the neighbor BS information. When the number of<br>
neighbor BSs of which BS information is transmitted by the 'N_NEIGHBORS'<br>
field of the fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV message, i.e. the quantity of the<br>
neighbor BS information, is less than the number of all of the neighbor BSs<br>
transmitted by the TOT_N_NEIGHBORS' field, i.e. the quantity of all of the<br>
neighbor BS information, the MS must continue to receive the remaining<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages in order to obtain information of the<br>
remaining neighbor BSs.<br>
Meanwhile, the 'Fragmentation Mode' field has been set to '0', it is<br>
necessary to differentiate the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages. Therefore,<br>
the 'Start bit' field represents transmission of the first fragmented MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message and is set to ' 1' in the first fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message.<br>
In other words, the 'Start bit' field is set to '0' in the other fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV messages than the first fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV message.<br>
The 'Number of Remaining Fragments' field represents the number of the other<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages which the MS must receive.<br>
Further, the MOB_NBR-ADV message includes a 'TLV Encoded<br>
Neighbor information' field of variable bits representing TLV-encoded<br>
information of the neighbor BSs, a 'DCD Configuration Change Count' field<br>
representing a Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) change count for<br>
configuration of the MOBNBR-ADV message, a 'UCD Configuration Change<br>
Count' field representing an Uplink Channel Descriptor (UCD) change count for<br>
configuration of the MOB_NBR-ADV message, a 'Length' field of 8 bits<br>
representing the length of the neighbor BS information included in the<br>
'N_NEIGHBOR' field, a 'Neighbor BS-ID' field of 48 bits representing the IDs<br><br>
of the neighbor BSs, a 'Preamble Index' field of 8 bits representing the preamble<br>
index, and an 'HO Process Optimization' field of 8 bits representing optimization<br>
of the handoff process.<br>
Hereinafter, a method for fragmenting the MOBNBR-ADV message<br>
including the neighbor BS information into fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
messages each having a size able to be transmitted in one frame, which uses a<br>
configuration of newly defined MOBNBR-ADV messages, will be described.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a method of fragmenting the MOBNBR-ADV message<br>
into fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages each having a size transmittable in<br>
one frame according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, when the serving BS has too many neighbor BSs and<br>
too much neighbor BS information, the original MOB_NBR-ADV message 310<br>
has a size exceeding a preset size of one frame 309. When the original<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 310 has a size exceeding a preset size of one frame<br>
309, it is impossible to transmit the original MOBNBR-ADV message 310 in<br>
one frame 309.<br>
However, in the present invention as described above, the original<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 310 is fragmented into a first MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
message 320 and a second MOB_NBR-ADV message 330. The original<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 310 includes a 'Management Message Type' field 301<br>
representing the type of the message, an 'Operator ID' field 303 representing the<br>
ID of the operator, a field 305 representing information of the neighbor BSs and<br>
including the 'NNEIGHBORS' field representing the number of all neighbor<br>
BSs transmitted by one frame 309, and an 'HMAC Tuple' field 307. As described<br>
herein, it is assumed that the number of neighbor BSs included in the<br>
'N_NEIGHBORS' field of the original MOB_NBR-ADV message 310 is 24 and<br>
the field 305 representing information of the neighbor BSs and including the<br>
'N_NEIGHBORS' field includes information of 24 neighbor BSs.<br>
According to the present invention, the original MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message 310 is fragmented into fragmented messages each having a size not<br>
exceeding the size of one frame 327, for example, into the first MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message 320 and the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330. The first<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 320, one of the fragmented messages, includes the<br>
'Management Message Type' field 301 representing the same message type as<br>
that included in the original MOB_NBR-ADV message 310, the 'Operator ID'<br>
field 303 representing the ID of the operator and the 'HMAC Tuple' field 307.<br>
Further, the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320 includes a<br>
'Fragmentation Index' field 321, a 'Total Fragmentation' field 323 and a field 325<br><br>
representing information of the neighbor BSs and including the<br>
'N_NEIGHBORS' field representing the number of all of the neighbor BSs<br>
included in the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320. The 'Fragmentation Index'<br>
field 321 represents an index of the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320 which is<br>
transmitted by the current frame 327, which represents that the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message transmitted by the current frame 327 from among the fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV messages (i.e. the first MOB_NBR-ADV message 320 and the<br>
second MOB_NBR-ADV message 330) is the first MOBNBR-ADV message<br>
320. The 'Total Fragmentation' field 323 represents the number of all of the<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages fragmented from the original<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 310 (in the case of FIG. 3, the 'Total Fragmentation'<br>
field 323 is set to '2', because the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320 and the<br>
second MOBNBR-ADV message 330 are all of the fragmented MOBNBR-<br>
ADV messages). As used herein, it is assumed that the 'NNEIGHBORS' field of<br>
the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320 includes 16 BSs so that the first<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 320 has a size not exceeding the size of the current<br>
frame 327. Therefore, the field 325 representing information of the neighbor BSs<br>
and including the 'N_NEIGHBORS' field includes 16 pieces of neighbor BS<br>
information.<br>
Further, the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330 is transmitted to the<br>
MS by the next frame 337 directly after the first MOB_NBR-ADV message 320<br>
is transmitted to the MS by the current frame 327. The second MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
message 330 includes the same 'Management Message Type' field 301 as that<br>
include in the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320, the 'Operator ID' field 303<br>
representing the ID of the operator and the 'HMAC Tuple' field 307. Further, the<br>
second MOBNBR-ADV message 330 includes a 'Fragmentation Index' field<br>
331 representing that the MOB_NBR-ADV message transmitted by the next<br>
frame 337 from among the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages (i.e. the first<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message 320 and the second MOB_NBR-ADV message 330)<br>
is the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330.<br>
As does the first MOB_NBR-ADV message 320, the second MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message 330 further includes a 'Total Fragmentation' field 333 and a field<br>
335 representing information of the neighbor BSs and including the<br>
'N_NEIGHBORS' field representing the number of all of the neighbor BSs<br>
included in the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330. The 'Total Fragmentation'<br>
field 333 represents the number of all of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
messages fragmented from the original MOBNBR-ADV message 310 (in the<br>
case of FIG. 3, the 'Total Fragmentation' field 333 is set to '2', because the first<br><br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 320 and the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330<br>
are all of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages). According to the<br>
assumption that the 'N_NEIGHBORS' field of the first MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
message 320 includes 16 BSs so that the first MOB_NBR-ADV message 320 has<br>
a size not exceeding the size of the current frame 327, 16 pieces of neighbor BS<br>
information have already been transmitted to the MS by the first MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message 320. As a result, the "N_NEIGHBORS' field of the second<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 330 transmitted to the MS by the next frame 337<br>
includes 8 BSs remaining after transmission of the first MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message 320 and the field 335 representing information of the neighbor BSs and<br>
including the 'N_NEIGHBORS' field includes 8 pieces of neighbor BS<br>
information.<br>
Although the above description is based on an assumption that the first<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message 320 includes 16 pieces of neighbor BS information so<br>
that the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320 has a size not exceeding the size of<br>
the current frame 327, the first MOBNBR-ADV message 320 may include a<br>
different number of neighbor BSs, which changes the number of neighbor BSs<br>
included in the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330. Further, according to the<br>
present invention, when the second MOBNBR-ADV message 330 has a size<br>
greater than that of the next frame 337, the original MOBNBR-ADV message<br>
310 may be fragmented into three or more fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
messages and the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages may be transmitted to<br>
the MS by frames the number of which corresponds to the number of the<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages.<br>
In this case, each of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages includes<br>
the fields as described above. When the serving BS fragments the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message, the fragmentation is based on the size of one frame so that each of<br>
the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages has a size not greater than the size of<br>
one frame and the number of BSs included in the field representing the neighbor<br>
BS information and including the 'NNEIGHBORS' field does not exceed the<br>
number of BSs transmittable in one frame. Further, each of the fragmented<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV messages commonly includes a 'Management Message Type'<br>
field having the same value, an 'Operator ID' field representing an ID of an<br>
operator, and an 'HMAC Tuple' field.<br>
Further, the serving BS inserts the number of fragmented MOBNBR-<br>
ADV messages into the 'Total Fragmentation' field, inserts an index of the current<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message transmitted by the current frame into the<br>
'Fragmentation Index' field, inserts information of neighbor BSs into the<br><br>
corresponding field, and then transmits the current fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
message to the MS.<br>
Although the above description discusses the case of broadcasting the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message in order for a serving BS to notify neighbor BS<br>
information to an MS, the present invention can be applied to the formation and<br>
transmission of other broadcast messages from the serving BS to the MS as well<br>
as the MOBNBR-ADV message. Hereinafter, an operation of a serving BS for<br>
forming and transmitting a broadcast message including neighbor BS information<br>
will be described.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a process according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, in which a serving BS forms and transmits a broadcast message<br>
including information of neighbor BSs.<br>
In step 401, the serving BS scans and collects information of neighbor<br>
BSs to transmit to an MS. In step 403, the serving BS compares the collected<br>
information of neighbor BSs with the size of the frame for carrying the collected<br>
information of neighbor BSs to the MS. When the collected information of<br>
neighbor BSs has a size not greater than the size of one frame, the serving BS<br>
proceeds to step 409, in which the serving BS constructs a broadcast message<br>
including the collected information and transmits the constructed broadcast<br>
message to the MS in one frame. Upon receiving the broadcast message through<br>
one frame, the MS obtains the information of the neighbor BSs included in the<br>
broadcast message. Therefore, the BWA system supports the handoff of the MS.<br>
When the collected information of neighbor BSs has a size greater than<br>
the size of one frame as a result of the determination in step 403, the serving BS<br>
proceeds to step 405, in which the serving BS divides the broadcast message<br>
including the collected information into fragmented broadcast messages each<br>
having a size not greater than the size of the frame.<br>
Then, in step 407, the serving BS sets up the fields constituting the<br>
fragmented broadcast message. For example, when the broadcast message has<br>
been divided into two fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages in step 405, the<br>
'Total Fragmentation' fields of the two fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV messages<br>
as shown in Table 1, which represent the number of all of the fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV messages, are set to have the same binary value of '0010'.<br>
Further, the 'Fragmentation Index' field of the first fragmented MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message from among the two fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV messages, which<br>
represents an index of the first fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message carried by<br>
the first frame, is set to have a value of '0001', and the 'Fragmentation Index'<br>
field of the second fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message carried by the second<br><br>
frame is set to have a value of '0010'. Then, in step 409, the serving BS transmits<br>
the fragmented broadcast message including the setup fields to the MS in the<br>
corresponding frame. When the broadcast message has been divided into two<br>
fragmented broadcast messages, the serving BS transmits the two fragmented<br>
broadcast messages in two frames.<br>
The MS sequentially receives the fragmented broadcast messages as<br>
described above in the corresponding number of frames. Specifically, when the<br>
received broadcast messages are fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages, the MS<br>
recognizes the field values of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages and<br>
checks the value of the 'Total Fragmentation' field representing the number of all<br>
of the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages, thereby determining if the<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message transmitted by the current frame is a fragmented<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message.<br>
For example, when the 'Total Fragmentation' field of the currently<br>
received MOB_NBR-ADV message has a value of '0000', it implies the currently<br>
received MOB_NBR-ADV message is not a fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV<br>
message. Further, the MS can obtain information of neighbor BSs from the<br>
currently received MOBNBR-ADV message by decoding the currently received<br>
MOBNBR-ADV message. When the 'Total Fragmentation' field of the currently<br>
received MOBNBR-ADV message has any value other than '0000', the MS<br>
recognizes the number of all the fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV messages from the<br>
value of the 'Total Fragmentation' field and waits for reception of the next<br>
fragmented MOBNBR-ADV message to be transmitted in the next frame. That<br>
is, the MS receives the fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages by sequentially<br>
transmitted multiple frames and obtains information of neighbor BSs by decoding<br>
the received fragmented MOBNBR-ADV messages. Also, the MS can obtain<br>
information of all of the neighbor BSs broadcast by the serving BS, by receiving<br>
all of the fragmented MOB_NBR-ADV messages.<br>
In a BWA communication system according to the present invention as<br>
described above, a serving BS can collect information of neighbor BSs, form a<br>
broadcast message including the information of the neighbor BSs, and fragment<br>
the broadcast message if the broadcast message is too large. Therefore, the<br>
serving BS can transmit a large amount of neighbor BS information to the MS. As<br>
a result, a BWA communication system according to the present invention can<br>
support handoff of an MS moving between cells because it is possible to transmit<br>
a large amount of neighbor BS information to the MS in the system.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br><br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
claims.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE "A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BROADCASTING<br>
AND RECEIVING INFORMATION OF NEIGHBOR BASE<br>
STATIONS IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM"<br>
The invention relates to a method for transmitting to a mobile station<br>
(150) information of neighbor base stations by a base station (121-133) in<br>
a communication system, the method comprising the steps of: setting,<br>
(407) by a controller of the base station, a value of each of a plurality of<br>
fields comprised in each of m fragments of the information on the<br>
neighbor base station; and sequentially transmitting, by the base station,<br>
each of the m fragments of the information of the neighbor base stations<br>
to the mobile station (150); wherein the m fragments are generated by<br>
fragmenting a broadcast message comprising the information of the<br>
neighbor base stations into m fragments, wherein the plurality of fields<br>
comprise in each of the m fragments a first field, a second field, and a<br>
third field, the first field indicates a fragmentation index for a current<br>
fragment, the second field indicates a total number of fragments equal to<br>
m, where m is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the third field<br>
indicates a number of the neighbor base stations comprised in the current<br>
fragment, wherein the current fragmentation comprises identifiers of the<br>
neighbor base stations comprised in the information of the current<br>
fragment, wherein the current fragment comprises physical frequencies<br>
for the neighbor base stations comprised in the information of the current<br>
fragmentation, and wherein the plurality of fields comprise an operator<br>
identifier, ID field and a Configuration Change Count field which is<br>
incremented each time when information for an associated neighbor base<br>
station has changed.</td>
