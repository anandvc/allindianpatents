				<td>Circular knitting machine<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a circular knitting machine with a needle cylinder<br>
arranged on a carrier of the needle cylinder with coaxially arranged toothed rim of the<br>
drive of the carrier of the needle cylinder and with a bearing body arranged on a<br>
machine bed surrounding the needle cylinder carrier in which the bearing body<br>
comprises four in pairs mutually opposite situated bearing races, two of which are<br>
situated on the needle cylinder carrier, and the other two, on the bearing body, with<br>
bearing balls situated between the bearing races, and with a part of the bearing races<br>
mounted radially and/or axially displaceably in relation to the machine bed and/or to<br>
the needle cylinder carrier.<br>
Background art<br>
In circular knitting machines, considerable part of the energy supplied by<br>
the drive is transformed into heat by the needle movement so that the needle beds<br>
and needle cams are the warmest areas of the machine and the needle cylinder<br>
carrier extends by heat in diameter by as much as tenths of a millimeter more than<br>
the cooler machine bed. To prevent excessive load on the bearing due to such<br>
dimensional variations, modern knitting machines make use of heat-compensated<br>
machine groups.<br>
Knitting machines of this kind are known for instance from the patent<br>
DE 2829678 where one of the bearing races is mounted, and adapted axially to<br>
move, on a radially arranged resilient flange. In an improved arrangement disclosed in<br>
the patent specification DE 3906773 A1, two axially adjacent bearing races are<br>
resiliency seated, each of them on a separate radially or axially arranged flange so as<br>
to permit the bearing races to move axially or radially.<br>
In another embodiment, disclosed in US 5 493 876, an arrangement is<br>
described in which the needle cylinder carrier or the machine bed has a pair of axially<br>
adjacent bearing races seated in the bearing ring which latter is connected by shifting<br>
with the needle cylinder carrier or with the machine bed by means of a connector<br>
permitting radial displacement and leaning against a resilient, axially arranged strip<br>
made as an integral part of the needle cylinder carrier or of the machine bed or of the<br>
bearing ring and acting as a heat compensator. The bearing races and the heat<br>
compensator are arranged on the needle cylinder carrier in the direction from the<br>
needle cylinder carrier downwards and on the machine bed in the direction from the<br>
machine bed upwards.<br>
Known methods of heat compensation on knitting machines have some grave<br>
drawbacks. The arrangement with one spring-biased bearing race requires a<br>
relatively large size of the compensation flange and is sensitive to manufacturing<br>
tolerances. The arrangement with two spring-biased bearing races requires for<br>
obtaining long service life of the bearing a relatively soft spring-loading which can lead<br>
to a radial displacement of the needle cylinder carrier as a consequence of the radial<br>
forces coming from the machine drive and acting on the toothed rim of the needle<br>
cylinder carrier. Due to its position under the needle bed carrier, the arrangement with<br>
the connector and with a resilient heat compensator requires a machine bed shape<br>
undergoing twisting as a consequence of the heat and force unbalance due to heat<br>
dilatations when the machine is heated. Besides, the bearing of the carrier of the<br>
cylindrical bed arranged in this way is not easily accessible and in case of a repair<br>
requires the dismantling of a considerable part of the machine which places heavy<br>
demands both on the repair time and on repair costs.<br>
The invention intends to remove or at least to minimize the drawbacks of<br>
the background art.<br>
Principle of the invention<br>
The goal of the invention has been reached by a circular knitting machine with<br>
a heat-compensated bearing whose principle consists in that the bearing body is<br>
equipped with a pair of outer bearing races situated in a bearing ring and is situated<br>
over the toothed rim of the drive for the needle cylinder carrier and that the bearing<br>
ring is to a limited extent movable in the radial direction.<br>
This arrangement provides for the positioning of the bearing on an easily<br>
accessible place and for its easy exchangeability. The radially movable seating also<br>
permits the heat expansion of the outer bearing races with all the positive effects. The<br>
bearing is seated at the narrowest, place of the machine bed and its seating is<br>
therefore very exact and stable. Another advantage of the invention consists in the<br>
possibility of arranging the bearing body so as to reduce heat transfer into the<br>
machine bed. If the heat extension of the inner bearing races surpasses in amount<br>
the heat extension of the outer bearing body, the preload of the bearing and due to<br>
this also the heat generated by rolling-contact forces in the bearing increases and<br>
thus heats the outer bearing body which increases its extension and thus reduces the<br>
preload of the bearing. In this way, the outer bearing body automatically keeps the<br>
preload of the bearing and compensates the heat extension of the needle cylinder<br>
carrier.<br>
The very character of the problem shows that an analogical, in principle a<br>
reverse arrangement to the described solution, is easily possible. In this solution, the<br>
bearing body has a pair of inner bearing races arranged in the bearing ring and is<br>
situated over the toothed rim of the needle cylinder carrier drive. The bearing ring is to<br>
a limited extent movable in a radial direction. Although in this variant, the self-<br>
regulation function of the variations in the preload of the bearing due to the difference<br>
in the heat extensibility of the machine parts in question will be diminished, this<br>
drawback can be compensated for instance by increasing the elasticity of the bearing<br>
ring.<br>
Description of the drawings<br>
The invention is schematically shown in the drawings in which Fig 1 is a cross<br>
section through the machine bed with the needle cylinder carrier with the bearing,<br>
through the needle cam block carrier, needle cylinder and needle cam blocks, with<br>
the bearing body with radially arranged flange with guide grooves on its<br>
circumference, Fig. 2 is a view from above of a guide member consisting of a pin and<br>
a cube with a circular aperture, Fig. 3a is a detail of a horizontal section through<br>
a guide member of the Fig. 3a, and Fig. 4 is a cross section through the machine bed<br>
of the Fig. 1 with the bearing body consisting of a bearing ring, an attachment flange,<br>
and a resilient connection between these members.<br>
Specific description<br>
The invention will be described in more details on the example of embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 1. The circular knitting machine comprises a needle cylinder 1 carrying<br>
knitting means and fixed on a carrier 2 of the needle cylinder 1. Coaxially arranged on<br>
the carrier 2 is a toothed rim 5 of a drive of the carrier 2 of the needle cylinder 1 and a<br>
bearing body 6 arranged on a machine bed 7 surrounding the carrier 2 of the needle<br>
cylinder 1 with four mutually opposite positioned bearing races 8a, 8b, 9a; and 9b,<br>
out of which those designed with 8a and 8b are inner bearing races whereas the<br>
other two, designed with 9a and 9b, are outer bearing races. The inner bearing<br>
races 8a and 8b are situated on the carrier 2 of the needle cylinder 1, and the outer<br>
bearing races 9a and 9b are situated on the bearing body 6. Between the bearing<br>
races 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b, bearing balls 6a are inserted The outer bearing races 9a<br>
and 9b are seated radially movable in relation to the bed 7 in a bearing ring 16 on the<br>
bearing ring 6 situated over the toothed rim 5 of the drive of the carrier 2 of the needle<br>
cylinder 1 The bearing body 6 carrying in the bearing ring 16 the outer bearing races<br>
9a and 9b is by guide means connected with the bed 7 in a radially movable way. In a<br>
preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the guide means consist of grooves 12<br>
provided on the circumference of the flange 17 of the bearing body 6 and cooperating<br>
with guide members inserted in them such as exactly mating cubes 3 arranged on<br>
pins 14 pressed in parallel with the machine axis in the contact surface of the bed 7 of<br>
the machine for the machine flange 17. During the heat extension (expansion) of the<br>
bearing body 6 the flange 17 is free to move radially in relation to the bed 7 of the<br>
knitting machine. The guide grooves 12 and the cubes 13 are so arranged that they<br>
have in the radial direction the play required for the mutual motion of the bearing body<br>
6 and of the needle cylinder 1 while their play in the tangential direction is a minimal<br>
one as required for exact guiding. Due to this, the bearing body 6 can radially expand<br>
while maintaining exact coaxial position with a carrier 3 of needle cam blocks of the<br>
needle cylinder 1 with the needle cam system 4. in the preferred embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 1, the axial position of the carrier 3 of needle cam blocks, in particular in single-<br>
bed knitting machines, is adjusted by a nut 11 for the central adjustment of the stitch<br>
length which is on its inner side fitted with a thread 11a. and on its outer side with a<br>
gearing 11b into which a not represented pinion serving to adjust, the stitch length<br>
enters. The nut H preferably leans against the upper surface of the flange 17 of the<br>
bearing body 6 and so achieves amore exact parallelism of the axes of the carrier 3<br>
of needle cam blocks and of the carrier 2 of the needle cylinder 1 <br>
Fig. 2 is a view from above on the guide means consisting of the groove 12 on<br>
the circumference of the flange 17 with the inserted cube 13 on the pin 14: The exact<br>
position of each cube 13 on the bed 7 can be obtained for instance by flushed boring<br>
and pinning after the adjustment of the position of the carrier 2 of the needle cylinder<br>
1 Another preferred embodiment of the guide means in which the flushing boring is<br>
not necessary is shown in Figs. 3a, 3b. In the example of embodiment shown in Fig.<br>
3a, the pin 14 carries an eccentric 15 on which the cube 13 is set. Fig. 3b shows the<br>
cross section through the embodiment of Fig. 3a. By adjusting the angular positron of<br>
the eccentric 15 by means of a hexagonal orifice in its upper part the tangential play<br>
can be adjusted to an extent sufficient to do away with the need for flushing boring of<br>
the cube 13 with the machine bed 7. The play is preferably adjusted by means of the<br>
eccentric 15 in the neighbouring grooves 12 alternately on the remote side of the<br>
grooves 12 in such a manner that the bearing body 6 is free radially to expand but<br>
locked against the shifting and tangential rotary displacements. The eccentrics 15 can<br>
conveniently adjust also the position of the bearing body 6 in relation to the bed 7 of<br>
the knitting machine.<br>
In a preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the flange 17 leans against the<br>
machine bed 7 only in the area of the recess 17a. This reduces the heat transfer from<br>
the bearing body 6 into the machine bed 7, and the temperature of the bearing body 6<br>
comes near to the temperature of the carrier 2 of the needle cylinder 1 Due to this,<br>
the radial extension of the inner bearing races 8a, 8b is practically the same as that of<br>
the bearing ring 16 with the outer bearing races 9a, 9b, and the bearing shows no<br>
increased load in heated machine. An analogical mutual approach exists in the heat<br>
extension of the nut 11 and the bearing body 6 so that the nut 11 then can be led<br>
more exactly by the guide recess 11c which improves the precision of the stitch<br>
length setting.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another preferred example of embodiment of the knitting machine<br>
with the heat-compensated bearing according to the invention. The function is<br>
identical with the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 but for the fact that the bearing body 6<br>
consists of the bearing ring 16 connected by a resilient connecting member 18 with<br>
the flange 17 fixed by bolts 19 with the machine bed 7. The connecting member 18 is<br>
resilient in the radial direction and permits the heat extension of the bearing ring 16.<br>
Its reduced cross section and height considerably cut the heat transfer from the<br>
bearing ring 16 into the machine bed 7-so that the extension of the bearing ring -16<br>
equals that of the inner bearing races 8a, 8b.The increased heat resistance of the<br>
connecting member 18 further increases the self-adjusting function of the bearing<br>
load. At increased preload, the bearing ring 16 increases its temperature and extends,<br>
thus reducing the preload. By calculation, the heat and operation conditions can be<br>
conveniently proposed so.as to ensure a constant preload of the bearing regardless<br>
of the variations in the machine temperature. In Fig. 4, the carrier 3 of needle cam<br>
blocks is shown without the setting nut. This embodiment will be used as a rule in<br>
double-bed knitting machines. It is self-evident that the arrangement with the bearing<br>
body 6 shown in Fig. 4 admits the use of the carrier 2 of the needle bed 1 with the<br>
setting nut 11.<br>
As is shown in Figs. 1 and 4, a part of the carrier 2 of the needle bed 1 is made<br>
as radially resilient compensation member, preferably U-shaped. This compensation<br>
member has resilient arms 20 and a connecting annulus 21. The elasticity of the<br>
compensation member limits both radial and torsional heat deformations of the carrier<br>
2 of the needle cylinder 1. In a not represented example of embodiment, the bearing<br>
can be so arranged that the bearing body, situated over the toothed rim of the drive<br>
for the needle cylinder carrier, has a pair of inner bearing races situated in a bearing<br>
ring and that the bearing ring is to a limited extent radially movable. The bearing body<br>
is mounted on the needle cylinder carrier by means of a member with reduced cross<br>
section so as to limit the heat transfer from the needle cylinder carrier into the bearing<br>
ring and into the machine bed. The bearing body also comprises a substantially radial<br>
flange fitted on its inner circumference with grooves into which guide members<br>
mounted on the needle cylinder carrier enter. The guide members are made<br>
equivalents to those of the shown embodiment. Like in the shown example of<br>
embodiment, the radial flange of the bearing body is equipped with a recess by<br>
means of which it is mounted on the needle cylinder carrier. The contact surface<br>
between the needle cylinder carrier and the recess of the radial flange of the bearing<br>
body is shaped as an annulus, and a gap exists between the remaining surface of the<br>
radial flange and the needle cylinde carrier. In another embodiment,-the bearing ring<br>
fitted with a pair of inner bearing races is connected by means of a resilient<br>
connecting member with a flange fixed on the needle cylinder carrier, and the bearing<br>
ring is an integral part of the bearing body. The resilient connecting means is made as<br>
a thin-walled cylinder coaxial with the axis of the machine.<br>
The examples of embodiment given above do not limit the scope of the<br>
invention to the described and shown embodiments which can be used both<br>
separately and in combinations not expressly described and shown.<br>
