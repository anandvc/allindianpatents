				<td>The present invention relates to Cyclohexyl(alkyl)-propanolamines.<br>
The present invention relates to novel cyclohexyl(alkyl)propanolamines, to the pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to a process for the preparation thereof and to synthesis intermediates in this process.<br>
WO 99/65895 describes phenoxypropanolamines in which the amine bears a substituted piperidine, these compounds showing agonist activity with respect to the beta-3 adrenergic receptor.<br>
The beta-3 adrenergic receptor has been the subject of many studies aimed at synthesizing compounds which are agonists with respect to this receptor, these compounds exerting a considerable anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effect in humans, as described, for example, by Weyer, C et al., Diabetes Metab., 1999, 25(1):11-21.<br>
It has now been found that certain propanolamines bearing a cyclohexyl(alkyl) group on the amine possess a powerful agonist activity with respect to beta-3 adrenergic receptors.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates, according to one of its aspects, to cyclohexyl(alkyl)propanolamines of formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
A is a group of formula (a) or (b)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where<br>
R	represents a hydrogen or halogen atom, an -S(0)2(C1-C4)alkyl<br>
group, an -NHS02(C1-C4)alkyl group, an -S02NH(C1-C4)alkyl group, an -NHS02phenyl-(C1-C4)alkyl group or an -NHSO2phenyl group, said phenyl possibly being substituted<br><br>
with a halogen atom, with a (Ci-C4)alkyl group or with a (Ci-C4)alkoxy group;<br>
RI	represents   a  hydrogen  atom  or  a   (Ci-C4)alkyl   group,   a<br>

unsaturated,   possibly  being   substituted  with  one   or  two (C|-C4)alkyl groups and bearing one or two carbonyl groups; n, m and z    are, independently, 0, 1 or 2;<br>
RS	represents a hydrogen or halogen atom, a (C]-C6)alkyl group, a<br>
(d-C4)alkoxy group, a -COO(Ci-C4)alkyl group, a -CO-(Ci-C4)alkyl group, an -NHSO2(Ci-C4)alkyl group, an -NHSO2phenyl-(C,-C4)alkyl group, -NO2, -CN, -CONR4R5, -COOH, or a 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl or 4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl group; R4andRs represent, independently, a hydrogen atom, a phenyl, a<br>
(Ci-C4)alkyl group or a phenyl-(Ci-C4)alkyl group; or R4 and Rj     with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, may form a<br>
ring of 5 to 7 atoms in total; and the salts or solvates thereof.<br>
In the present description, the terms "(Ci-C4)alkyl" and "(Ci-C6)alkyl" denote monovalent radicals formed from a respectively CpC4 and Ci-Cg hydrocarbon containing a straight or branched saturated chain.<br>
In the present description, the term "halogen" denotes an atom chosen from chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine.<br>
Preferred compounds are those in which n and m are each zero. Other preferred compounds are those in which RI is a hydrogen atom. Other preferred compounds are those in which R is chosen from an -NHSO2(CrC4)alkyl   group,   an   -NHSO2phenyl-(CrC4)alkyl   group   or  an -NHSOaphenyl group.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those in which R3 is -COO(Ci-C4)alkyl or -CO(C,-C4)alkyl or CONR4R5.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those in which R4 is in position 4 of the benzene.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those in which z is 2. Other preferred compounds are those in which X is a methylene, an ethylene or a propylene.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those in which X is a carbonyl, a -CO-CO-group, a -CO-C((Ci-C4)alkyl)2-CO- group, a methylene monosubstituted or disubstituted with (CrC4)alkyl or a -COCH2- group.<br>
Preferred -NHSO2phenyl-(Ci-C4)alkyl and -SO2phenyl-(Ci-C4)alkyl groups are, respectively, benzylsulphonylamino and benzylsulphonyl.<br>
When R4 and Rg form, with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a ring of 5 to 7 atoms, preferred rings are piperidine and pyrrolidine.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention comprise both the addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids, such as hydrochlorate, hydrobromate, sulphate, hydrogen sulphate, dihydrogen phosphate, citrate, maleate, tartrate, fumarate, gluconate, methanesulphonate, 2-naphtalenesulphonate, etc., and the addition salts which allow suitable separation or crystallization of the compounds of formula (I), such as picrate or oxalate, or the addition salts with optically active acids, for example camphosulphonic acids and mandelic or substituted mandelic acids.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) have a free carboxyl group, the salts also comprise the salts with inorganic bases, preferably those with alkaline metals such as sodium or potassium, or with organic bases.<br>
The optically pure stereoisomers, and also the mixtures of isomers of the compounds of formula (I), due to the asymmetric carbon, in any proportion, are also part of the present invention.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (I) are the compounds in which the configuration of the carbon of the propanolamine bearing the OH group is (S).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be in the form of "cis" or "trans" geometrical isomers, depending on the relative position of the substituents in positions 1 and 4 of the cyclohexyl ring (marked with a star). These pure isomers and their mixtures, in any proportion, are part of the present invention.<br>
The mixtures of optical and geometrical  stereoisomers  above, in any proportion, are also part of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by treating a compound of<br>
formula (II):<br>
O<br>
(II)<br>
in which A is as indicated above, with an amine of formula (HI)<br><br>
in which n, m and R3 are as defined above and, optionally, transforming the compound of formula (I) thus obtained into a salt or solvate thereof.<br>
More particularly, the reaction between the compounds of formulae (II) and (HI) is carried out in an organic solvent, such as a lower alcohol, for instance methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and tert-butanol; dimethyl sulphoxide; a linear or cyclic ether; an amide such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide or mixtures of these solvents; preferably using at least equimolecular amounts of the reagents.<br>
The temperature of the reaction is between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent chosen.<br>
When RI represents hydrogen, it is preferable to protect the functional group with a protective group in order to increase the yield of the reaction. As protective groups, use may be made of the protective groups which are conventional for phenol groups, such as for example methoxyethoxymethyl (MEM), trimethylsilylethoxymethyl (SEM), benzyl, optionally substituted, or benzoyl, according to well-known techniques.<br>
Other functional groups optionally present (amino groups for example) may, themselves, also be protected by suitable protective groups according to well-known conventional techniques.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are compounds which are known in the literature or they may be prepared using processes similar to described processes.<br>
The compounds of formula (ffl) may be prepared using an intermediate of formula (IX) obtained according to the following Scheme 1.<br>
(FiIn the formulae of Scheme 1, m is as defined above and Hal represents a halogen, preferably bromine, while R'3 is a 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-y', 4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl, (d-C4)alkyl or (C,-C4)alkoxy group.<br>
These are reactions which are well-known to those skilled in the art; the condensation step may, for example, be carried out in a way similar to that described by Meyers et al., J. Org. Chem., 1974, 39: 2787. The intermediate alcohol (VI) is transformed into the derivative (VH), for example according to the method described in A.M. Gonzales-Cameno et al., Tetrahedron, 1994, 50_: 10971 or with POC13 as described in Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 1995, 27: 122, and then into the saturated derivative (VIII) via a conventional reduction reaction. The hydrolysis of the acetal group may be carried out in a way similar to the reaction described by C. Szantay et al., Tetrahedron, 1996, 52(33): 11053.<br>
The intermediate of formula (IX) may be used to prepare the compounds of formula (HI) by transforming, for example, the carbonyl group of the cyclohexane into an amino group by reduction of the corresponding oxime or, when n is 1 or 2, into an aminoalkyl group by reaction with a cyanide o nitromethane, or by the Wittig reaction with the desired phosphonate, according to well-known reactions.<br>
When R'3 is a 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl or 4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl group, the compound of formula (HI) in which R3 is -COOH is easily obtained by hydrolysis.<br>
Most of the compounds of formula (HI), such as for example those in which R3 is -CN, -CO(CrC4)alkyl, -COO(d-C4)alkyl, a sulphonamido group, a halogen atom or -NOi, may then be obtained by transformation of the compound of formula (IH) in which R3 is -COOH, according to reactions well-known to those skilled in the art, after protection of the NH2 group with a protective group such as, for example, the BOC group and/or benzyl.<br>
Alternatively, use may be made, as a starting product, of the compound of formula (V) in which R'3 is -CN, and m = 0.1; in this case, the condensation of step (a) is carried out as described, for example, in J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35: 320 and the product (III) obtained at the end of the process above is easily transformed into the derivatives in which R3 is -COOH, -CO(Ci-C4)alkyl or -CONR4R5, after protection of the NH2 group with a protective group such as, for example, the BOC (rerf-butoxycarbonyl) group and/or benzyl.<br>
The "cis" and "trans" isomers may be obtained by separation of the mixture, for example by chromatography or by selective crystallization, according to conventional processes.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the present invention with respect to beta-3 activity was demonstrated using in vitro tests on human colon according to the method described by T. Croci et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 1997, 122: 139P, by L. Manara et al.. Gut, 2000, 47: 337-342 and in EP-B-436435.<br>
More particularly, it was noted that the compounds of formula (I) are much more active on the isolated colon than on the atrium and on the trachea.<br>
These surprising properties of the compounds of formula (I) make it possible to envisage their use as medicinal products with beta-3 agonist action. In addition, the compounds of formula (I) are relatively nontoxic; in particular, their acute toxicity is compatible with their use as medicinal products for treating diseases in which compounds having an affinity for the beta-3 receptor, in particular beta-3 agonists, are of use. Such diseases are described in the literature. The compounds of formula (I), and also the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may therefore, for example, be indicated in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory diseases of the intestine, for instance irritable bowel disease (IBD), as modulators of intestinal motivity, as lipolytic agents, anti-obesity agents, anti-diabetic agents, psychotropic agents, anti-glaucoma agents, cicatrizing agents and anti-depressants, as inhibitors of uterine contractions, as tocolytics for preventing or delaying preterm births, and for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of dysmenorrhoea. In addition, the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the treatment of certain diseases of the central nervous system, such as for example depression, and also of certain disorders of the urinary system, such as urinary incontinence.<br>
The use of compounds of formula (I) above, and also that of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, for preparing the medicinal products above, constitutes a subsequent aspect of the present invention.<br>
For such a use, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, is administered to the mammals which require such a treatment.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) above, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, may be used at daily doses of 0.01 to 20 mg per kilo of body weight of the mammal to be treated, preferably at daily doses of from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. In humans, the dose may vary preferably from 0.5 mg to 1500 mg per day, in particular from 2.5 to 500 mg, depending on the age of the individual to be treated, the type of treatment, prophylactic or curative, and the seriousness of the disorder. The compounds of formula (I) are generally administered as a dosage unit of 0.1 to 500 mg, preferably of 0.5 to 100 mg, of active principle, one to five times a day.<br>
Said dosage units are preferably formulated in pharmaceutical compositions in which the active principle is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing, as an active principle, a compound of formula (I) above or a pharmaceutically acceptable sail jr solvate thereof.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, transdermal or rectal administration, the active ingredients of formula (I) above, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, may be administered in unit administration forms, mixed with conventional pharmaceutical supports, to animals and humans for treating the abovementioned disorders. The unit administration forms which are suitable comprise oral forms such as tablets, gel capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual and buccal administration forms, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration forms, local administration forms and rectal administration forms.<br>
When a solid composition in the form of tablets is prepared, the main active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic or the like. The tablets may be coated with sucrose or other suitable materials, or they may be treated such that they have sustained or delayed activity and that they release, in a continuous manner, a predetermined amount of active principle.<br>
A preparation of gel capsules is obtained by mixing the active ingredient with a diluent and pouring the mixture obtained into soft or hard gel capsules.<br>
A preparation in the form of a syrup or elixir may contain the active ingredient together with a sweetener, preferably a calorie-free sweetener,<br>
methylparaben and propylparaben as antiseptics, and also a flavour enhancer and a suitable colorant.<br>
The water-dispersible powders or granules may contain the active ingredient mixed with dispersing agents or wetting agents, or suspending agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, and also with sweeteners or flavour correctors.<br>
For local administration, the active principle is mixed into an excipient for preparing creams or ointments, or it is dissolved in a vehicle for intraocular administration, for example in the form of an eyewash.<br>
For rectal administration, use is made of suppositories prepared with binders which melt at rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene glycols.<br>
For parenteral administration, aqueous suspensions, saline solutions or injectable sterile solutions which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersion agents and/or wetting agents, for example propylene glycol or butylene glycol, are used.<br>
The active principle may also be formulated in the form of microcapsules, optionally with one or more supports or additives.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to a method for treating pathological conditions which are improved by a beta-3 agonist action, which comprises administering a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), in particular the compounds (I) labelled with an isotope, may also be used as laboratory tools in biochemical assays.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) bind to the beta-3 adrenergic receptor. These compounds may therefore be used in a conventional binding assay, in which an organic tissue in which this receptor is particularly abundant is used, and the amount of compound (I) displaced by a test compound is measured, in order to evaluate the affinity of said compound with respect to the binding sites of this particular receptor<br>
Another specific subject of the present invention is therefore a reagent which can be used in biochemical assays, which comprises at least one suitably labelled compound of formula (I).<br>
