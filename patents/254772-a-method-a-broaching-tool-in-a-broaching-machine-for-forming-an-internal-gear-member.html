BROACHING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING<br>
A GEAR MEMBER WITH TAPERED GEAR TEETH<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]            The present invention pertains generally to a broaching apparatus and<br>
method for producing a gear member with tapered gear teeth.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]            When a planetary gearset is under load, even under light load in the<br>
context of generally experienced gear noise situations, the planet carrier may deflect and<br>
the planet pinion bearings, which are not perfectly rigid, may become slightly displaced.<br>
As a result, the gears of a planetary gearset may not remain perfectly parallel under load.<br>
In other words, gears that perfectly mesh in theory may, under actual working conditions,<br>
contact each other at a point that is not centered in the middle of the tooth flank.<br>
[0003]            It is well known to subject gear members to a heat treatment process in<br>
order to improve material characteristics such as strength or rigidity. Under certain<br>
circumstances, the heat treatment process can vary or alter tooth flank geometry which<br>
can also cause misalignment between the teeth of engaged gear members. This<br>
misalignment, either from planet carrier deflection or from the heat treatment process,<br>
can shift the load distribution on a gear tooth thereby increasing gear noise and reducing<br>
durability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]            The  present   invention  provides  a  broaching   machine   configured  to<br>
produce an internal gear member. The broaching machine includes a broaching tool<br>
defining a central axis. The broaching tool includes a first set of broaching teeth<br>
configured to cut only a first flank portion of a plurality of gear teeth; and<br><br>
2<br>
a second set of broaching teeth configured to cut only a second flank portion of the<br>
plurality of gear teeth. The plurality of gear teeth are formed such that the first and<br>
second flank portions of each gear tooth are tapered between a first end portion and a<br>
second end portion. The broaching machine also includes a motor configured to rotate<br>
the broaching tool about the central axis at a selectable rate and in a selectable direction.<br>
[0005]            The broaching tool may also include a third set of broaching teeth<br>
configured to cut both the first flank and the second flank of the plurality of gear teeth.<br>
[0006]            The present invention also provides a method for forming an internal gear<br>
member having a plurality of gear teeth. The method includes providing a broaching tool<br>
having a first set of broaching teeth and a second set of broaching teeth, and providing a<br>
gear blank defining an internal aperture. The broaching tool is passed through the<br>
internal aperture of the gear blank to form the gear teeth. The broaching tool is rotated at<br>
a first predefined rate as it passes through the internal aperture of the gear blank such that<br>
the first set of broaching teeth cut only a first flank portion of each tooth. The broaching<br>
tool is rotated at a second predefined rate as it passes through the internal aperture of the<br>
gear blank such that the second set of broaching teeth cut only a second flank portion of<br>
each tooth.<br>
[0007]            The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best   modes   for   carrying   out  the   invention  when  taken   in   connection  with  the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

[0012]            FIGURE 3c is a schematic sectional illustration of the gear member of<br>
FIGURE 2 engaged by broaching teeth shown in Figure 1 during a third stage of<br>
broaching formation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013]            Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 shows a broaching machine 6 in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The broaching machine 6 includes a motor 8 configured to selectively rotate a<br>
broaching tool 10 about an axis 18 as will be described in detail hereinafter. The<br>
broaching tool 10 includes a shank 12, a plurality of broach teeth 14, and an end portion<br>
16. The plurality of broach teeth 14 are not explicitly shown in Figure 1, but are<br>
schematically represented by the series of annular ribs or flanges shown. It should be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art that the annular ribs each include a sequence of<br>
notches (not shown) to form the individual broach teeth 14. The plurality of broach teeth<br>
14 include a first section of teeth 20, a second section of teeth 22 and a third section of<br>
teeth 24.<br>
[0014]             Referring to Figure 2, a gear member 26 produced in accordance with the<br>
method of the present invention is shown. The gear member 26 is preferably machined<br>
from an annular gear blank (not shown) defining a centrally located aperture 28. As will<br>
be described in detail hereinafter, the broaching tool 10 is pulled through the aperture 28<br>
to form a plurality of internal gear teeth 30. The gear teeth 30 each define a first end<br>
portion 32, a second end portion 34, a first flank 36 and a second flank 38. The gear teeth<br>
30 are tapered, which means that the first and second flanks 36, 38 are not parallel.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, the first end portion 32 is generally parallel to<br>
the second end portion 34, and the second end portion 34 is wider than the first end<br>
portion  32.     The tapered  configuration of the  first and  second  flanks  36,  38  in<br><br>
4<br>
combination with the parallel  first and  second end portions  32,  34  are  generally<br>
configured to define a trapezoidal cross section for the teeth 30 as shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
5<br>
[0015]            The gear member 26 is preferably supported as the broaching tool is<br>
pulled through the aperture 28 to cut the gear teeth 30. According to the preferred<br>
embodiment, the gear member 26 is preferably rigidly supported and the broaching tool<br>
10 is selectively rotated about its axis 18 as it is pulled through the aperture 28.<br>
According to an alternate embodiment, the gear member 26 may rotate while the<br>
broaching tool 10 is pulled through the aperture 28 in a non-rotating manner. According<br>
to another alternate embodiment, both the gear member 26 and the broaching tool 10 can<br>
both be rotated as the broaching tool 10 is pulled through the aperture 28.<br>
[0016]            Figures 3a-3c illustrate a sequence of steps or stages during which the gear<br>
member 26 is formed. More precisely, Figure 3a shows a first stage wherein a gear<br>
member 26a is formed by the broaching teeth 20, Figure 3b shows a second stage<br>
wherein a gear member 26b is formed by the broaching teeth 22, and Figure 3c shows a<br>
third stage wherein a gear member 26c is formed by the broaching teeth 24. It should be<br>
appreciated that the sequence of Figures 3b-3c is shown for illustrative purposes and that<br>
these stages can be performed in any order. Like reference numbers are used in Figures<br>
3a-3c to refer to like components from Figures 1 and 2. For example, the suffix "a"<br>
added to a reference numeral identifies a similar component during a first stage of<br>
formation. Similarly, the suffix "b" and "c" added to a reference numeral identifies a<br>
similar component during second and third stages of formation, respectively.<br>
[0017]            Referring to Figure 3a, a sectional view of the gear member 26a during a<br>
first stage of formation is shown. As shown, the broach teeth 20 engage both the first and<br>
second flanks 36a, 38a to produce a plurality of generally rectangular gear teeth 30a in a<br>
conventional manner. The gear teeth 30a produced during the first stage of formation are<br>
generally parallel, which means that the first and second flanks 36a, 38a of each gear<br>
tooth 30a are generally parallel. The first and second end portions 32a, 34a are<br>
preferably generally parallel and substantially the same length.<br><br>
6<br>
[0018]            Referring to Figure 3b, a sectional view of the gear member 26b during a<br>
second stage of formation is shown. During this stage, the broaching tool 10 (shown in<br>
Figure 1) is rotated about its central axis 18 (shown in Figure 1) in a counter-clockwise<br>
direction such that the broaching teeth 22 are brought into engagement with the second<br>
flank 38b of each tooth 30b. As shown, the second flank 38b of each tooth 30b becomes<br>
"tapered" or non-parallel relative to the first flank 36b as the second flank 38b is cut by<br>
the broaching teeth 22. The rate at which the broaching tool 10 is rotated is selectable to<br>
control the degree of taper of the second flank 38b. The first and second end portions<br>
32b, 34b are preferably generally parallel, and one of the end portions (e.g., the first end<br>
portion 32b) is narrower than the other of the end portions (e.g., the second end portion<br>
34b).<br>
[0019]            Referring to Figure 3c, a sectional view of the gear member 26c during a<br>
third stage of formation is shown. During this stage, the broaching tool 10 (shown in<br>
Figure 1) is rotated about its central axis 18 (shown in Figure 1) in a clockwise direction<br>
such that the broaching teeth 24 are brought into engagement with the first flank 36c of<br>
each tooth 30c. As shown, the first flank 36c of each tooth 30c becomes "tapered" or<br>
non-parallel relative to the second flank 38c as the first flank 36c is cut by the broaching<br>
teeth 24. The rate at which the broaching tool 10 is rotated is selectable to control the<br>
degree of taper of the first flank 36c. The first and second end portions 32c, 34c are<br>
preferably generally parallel, and one of the end portions (e.g., the first end portion 32c)<br>
is narrower than the other of the end portions (e.g., the second end portion 34c).<br>
[0020]            In addition to producing a gear member having square gear teeth as shown<br>
in Figure 2, the method of the present invention may also be implemented to produce a<br>
helical gear member (not shown) such as those used in a planetary gearset. To produce a<br>
helical gear member, a helical broaching tool (not shown) is generally rotated in only one<br>
direction, however the rate of rotation is varied.<br>
[0021]            Advantageously, the tapered geometry of gear members produced in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be adapted to accommodate for carrier<br>
deflection of a planetary gearset (not shown) which is under load. Therefore, the<br>
alignment  of the  gear  members  within  a planetary  gearset  may  be  improved  by<br><br>
7<br>
incorporating tapered gear teeth such that gear noise is reduced and durability is<br>
increased. Similarly, it has been observed that the tapered gear tooth geometry can be<br>
adapted to accommodate for tooth flank deformation caused by a heat treatment process.<br>
In other words, the gear teeth can be tapered by an amount necessary to compensate for<br>
heat treatment induced tooth flank deformation and thereby improve tooth alignment of<br>
engaged gear members.<br>
[0022]            While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
