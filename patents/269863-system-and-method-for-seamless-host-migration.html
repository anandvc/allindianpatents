SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SEAMLESS HOST MIGRATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent<br>
application number 60/997,918 filed October 5,2007 and entitled "Systems and Methods for Seamless Host Migration," the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0002]	The present invention application is related to US patent application<br>

The present application is further related to U.S. patent application number 10/359359 filed February 4,2003 and entitled "Multi-User Application Program Interface," the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0003]	The present invention relates generally to networks. More specifically,<br>
the present invention relates to data distribution in networks.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[0004]	A network may include a group of computing devices connected together<br>
by a communications system. A computer in the network may communicate, exchange<br>
data, and share resources with the other computers in the network. Examples of<br>
networks include a personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), and wide<br>
area network (WAN).<br>
[0005]	Various network configurations are known in the art. The traditional<br>
client-server network illustrated in FIGURE 1A includes a host 110 connected to clients<br>
120A-D. The host 110 establishes the network session 130, controls which and how<br>
many clients may join the network session 130 and how the clients 120A-D interact with<br><br><br>
each other once they have joined network session 130. Because the host 110 generally<br>
has large amounts of bandwidth and processing power, the host 110 is may be capable<br>
of managing and distributing data to and from all the clients 120A-D in the network<br>
session 130. In such a configuration, data from a particular client (e.g., client 120D) may<br>
be distributed to other clients (e.g., clients 120A-C) through the host 110. For example,<br>
client 120D may transmit data to the host 110- When another client, such as client 120A,<br>
requests that data, the host 110 transmits that data to client 120A.<br>
[0006]	By virtue of being connected to the host a client may request only the<br>
data that the client needs (via the host) so that the client does not have to manage<br>
otherwise unneeded data. Such an arrangement may be common amongst clients that<br>
do not have the ability to effectively manage all the data exchanged within a network<br>
session. These clients may require a host to manage and distribute the data.<br>
[0007J	A disadvantage of having the host manage and distribute data in a<br>
network session is that data can be lost when there are connectivity issues affecting communications between the host and any one of the session clients. In such an instance, the data from a particular client cannot be transmitted to the host. That data would also be unavailable to the other clients in the network. For example, client 120D may suddenly become disconnected from the host 110. Information that client 120D would have sent to the host 110 never reaches the host 110 and, as a consequence, the information cannot be transmitted to the rest of the network (i.e., clients 120A-C). The missing information may cause a disruption to the network session 130, possibly affecting the operations of the other clients. This may be especially true in the context of interactive network game play.<br>
[0008]	There is, therefore, a need in the art for improved systems and methods<br>
for network data distribution that addresses problems related to network session connectivity and maintaining an uninterrupted exchange of data in the session.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	Systems and methods of the present invention provide for maintaining<br>
network data distribution that would allow a network session to weather interrupted communication between a host and clients without any loss of data. Host functions migrate to a client seamlessly and without significant loss of data- Embodiments of ihe present invention provide for one or more clients to serve as a backup host for the network session. When the other clients transmit data to the host? they may also transmit the data to one or more backup hosts. For example, a ctient that sends data to the host may not receive acknowledgement of the data within a pertain period of time. That client may re-transmit the data to the host as well transmit the data to the backup host<br>
[0010]	Various embodiments of the present invention include methods for<br>
network data distribution. Such methods include connecting a host to clients, determining whether a client is capable of serving as a backup hpst and if so, transmitting to that client certain information that would allow the client serve as the backup host. Serving as the backup hosts includes receiving information from other clients when those other clients cannot communicate with the host In some embodiments of the present invention, the method further provides for indicating that communications between a host and a client are interrupted and for terminating the connection between the host and the particular client.<br>
[0011]	Various embodiments of the present invention include systems for<br>
network data distribution. Such systems may include a host a frist client capable of serving as a backup host and a second client capable of transmitting data to the first client when communications between the host and the second client is interrupted. In some embodiments of the present invention, the second client may also serve as a backup host. Some embodiments of the present invention may include a plurality of clients, each configured to serve as backup hosts.<br>
[0012]	A host system for use in network distribution systems may also be<br>
provided by embodiments of the present invention. Such host systems may include an acknowledgement module to acknowledge client communications upon receipt a negotiation module to negotiate whether a particular client is capable of serving as a<br><br><br>
backup host, and a backup application module to deliver to the client an application providing host information. Some embodiments of the present invention further include a host information database and a timer.<br>
[0013]	Some embodiments of the present invention include computer storage<br>
media and instructions for network data distribution. Such instructions may provide for connecting a host to clients, negotiating with a client capable of serving as a backup host, and transmitting host information to the client so that it may begin serving as a backup host.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
10021)	The present invention includes systems and methods for network data<br>
distribution. Embodiments of the present invention may allow host migration to occur seamlessly. A network session may continue without significant loss of data in the event of interrupted communication between a host and a client. A host of a network session may be connected to a number of clients. One (or more) of these clients may be capable of serving as a backup host. Backup viability is negotiated with a client and host information is transmitted to the client, which may then act as a backup host. The backup host may then connect to and receive data from the other clients in the network session. Thereafter, if communication between the host and a particular client is interrupted, that particular client may transmit its data to the backup host allowing the network session to continue without any loss of data.<br>
[0022]	The elements identified throughout are exemplary and may include<br>
various alternatives, equivalents, or derivations thereof. Various combinations of<br>
hardware, software, and computer-executable instructions may be utilized. Program<br>
modules and engines may include routines, programs, objects, components, and data<br>
structures that effectuate the performance of particular tasks when executed by a<br>
processor, which may be general purpose or application specific. Computer-executable<br>
instructions and associated data structures stored in a computer-readable medium<br>
represent examples of programming means for executing the steps of the methods<br>
and/or implementing particular system configurations disclosed herein.<br>
[0023]	In the client-server network configuration illustrated in FIGURE 1A and<br>
as discussed in detail above, each client does not have to process all the data in a network session. Instead, each client receives and processes only the data that is necessary for the client to participate in the network session. Some clients are not capable of managing all the data efficiently due to, for example, lack of bandwidth or lack of processing power. Some clients, however, do have the ability to manage all the data in a network session. These particular clients may act as backup hosts, storing some or all of the data from the network session.<br><br><br>
**<br><br>
[0024]	In contrast to the system configuration of FIGURE 1A, FIGURE IB<br>
illustrates an exemplary system for network data distribution with one backup host, client 160A. A backup host may be any client capable of performing some or all of the functions of a host of a network session. When the host 140 of the network session 150 cannot or does not perform, some or all of the hosting responsibilities may migrate to a backup host. To qualify as a backup host requires the candidate host (client) to exhibit backup viability. Exhibiting backup viability may involve meeting one or more requirements concerning, for example, bandwidth, processing power, memory, hardware or software configurations, or quality of service. A client's backup viability may be determined through negotiation with the host.<br>
[0025]	After completing negotiations concerning and confirming backup<br>
viability, host infonnation may be transmitted between host 140 and client 160A through network session 150. The host information may include the network name, the internet protocol (IP) addresses of the clients in the network, firewall information, and information concerning specific responsibilities should client 160A need to takeover certain host responsibilities. Using the host information, client 160A may be able to act as a backup host in the event that one or more connections between the host 140 and the other clients 160B-D become interrupted. For example, if client 160B becomes disconnected from host 140, client 160B may transfer data to client 160A as will be illustrated in the context of FIGURE 3A and FIGURE 3B. By migrating host responsibilities from host 140 to client 160A, information from client 160B is not completely lost to the network session 150.<br>
[0026]	In some embodiments, more than one client may be capable of serving as<br>
backup hosts. FIGURE IC illustrates an exemplary system for network data distribution with several backup hosts—clients 190A-D. Each client in the network session 180 of FIGURE IC may be responsible for particular backup host responsibilities should original host 170 become unavailable. For example, client 190A may be responsible for scorekeeping while client 190B may be responsible for state changes in the game environment. Client 190C may be responsible for admissions criteria (e.g., who may participate in the game) whereas client 190D may be responsible for chat functionality.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, client 190A may be responsible for all of the aforementioned tasks and<br>
clients 190B-D take over those tasks should client 190A subsequently fail.<br>
[0027]	FIGURE 2 illustrates an exemplary configuration 200 for a computing<br>
device offering seamless host migration in a network data distribution system. The host<br>
200, which may act as a central communications hub in a network, may be a computing<br>
device such as a server. A computing device typically reserved for client operations<br>
may also exhibit some or all of the configurations of host 200 due to the fact that a client<br>
may, at some point, become a backup host. Host 200 may include a network interface<br>
210, acknowledgement module 220, negotiation module 230, host information database<br>
240, backup application module 250, polling module 260, and timer 270.<br>
10028]	A module (or application), as referenced in the present invention, is a<br>
collection of routines that perform various system-level functions. A module may be<br>
dynamically loaded and unloaded by hardware and device drivers as required. The<br>
modular software components described herein may also be incorporated as part of a<br>
larger software platform or integrated as part of an application specific component.<br>
[0029]	Network interface 210 may be any of a variety of hardware and/or<br>
software components configured to allow for communication between the host and other computing devices in the network. Network interface 210 may include components for communicating over wired, wireless, and/or Internet-based communications networks.<br>
[0030]	Acknowledgement module 220 allows for verification that information<br>
transmitted by a client was received by the host 200. When host 200 receives information from a client through network interface 210, acknowledgement module 220 may transmit an acknowledgement of receipt (ACK) to the client sending the information. For example, if a client sends information concerning a change in game state data to host 200, acknowledgement module 220 may transmit an ACK reply to the transmitting client indicating that information was received. The ACK reply sent by acknowledgement module 220 may further include an indication of what information was received and how much of that information was received and/or if any of that information was corrupted or otherwise incomplete.<br><br><br>
I [0031]	Non-receipt of an ACK with respect to a particular data transmission by<br>
the transmitting client may indicate that the data transmission was never received by the host 200. Non-receipt of the data transmission (or a portion thereof) by the host 200 may indicate a problem with the connection between the host 200 and the client that sent the data transmission or the host 200 in and of itself. If a particular number of data transmissions fail to receive an ACK reply from the host 200, the transmitting client may invoke a migration operation whereby some or all of the host functionalities are migrated to a backup host.<br>
[0032]	Negotiation module 230 negotiates the backup viability of a client based<br>
on a variety of parameters. For example, a viable backup host / client candidate may be required to have a certain amount of available bandwidth. The bandwidth of the client may need to be sufficient to allow the client to manage all the data in the network session. Backup viability may require that the client conform to various quality of service standards as they relate to, for example, ping rate, packet loss, available memory, processor speed, and the like.<br>
[0033]	Negotiation module 230 may further determine whether the client<br>
candidate is capable of connecting to each of the other clients in the network. A viable backup host may need to be able to connect to and receive information from each of the other clients in the network. The parameters for backup viability may be determined by the type of network session. For example, a particular gaming network session may require a certain amount of bandwidth and processor speed for backup viability due to the number of state changes that may occur in the game environment. Less complex transactions, such as simple file transfers, may require less bandwidth and/or processing power.<br>
[0034]	Negotiation module 230 may be configured to negotiate backup viability<br>
with multiple clients thereby resulting in a series of backup hosts. Alternatively, the negotiation module 230 may be configured to allocate backup responsibilities for particular tasks amongst a group of clients. By providing for a series of backup hosts, hosting duties may migrate seamlessly from a host to a first backup host to a second backup host and so on as network or host/client conditions warrant. An order of backup host responsibilities and/or the particular responsibilities may be assigned based on the<br><br><br>
Drder in which the clients connected to the host. Alternatively, order and/or<br>
responsibilities may be based on other factors such as bandwidth or quality of service.<br>
[0035]	Host information database 240 may store information concerning the<br>
host, the clients, or the network session. The information stored in host information database 240 may allow for a computing device to perform certain hosting duties, such as connecting to the other clients in the network session. Such host information may include the network name, the Internet protocol (IP) addresses of the clients in the network, and firewall information. Host information database 240 may be updated when events such as a client disconnecting from the network or a new client joining the network occur. The IP addresses of the new clients would, for example, need to be added to the host information database 240.<br>
[0036]	Operating in conjunction with host information database 240, backup<br>
application module 250 generates an application that may be downloaded, installed, and executed on the client. This application provides a client with certain operational functionality that may be required of the client in order for it to serve as a backup host in addition to satisfying underlying viability requirements. The application may configure the client for connecting to and for exchanging data with other clients in the network session.<br>
[0037]	Optional polling module 260 may be configured to poll all the clients in a<br>
network session. Polling module 260 may be used to poll clients for connectivity. Polling for connectivity may include sending small packets of data to each client in the network session, receiving replies/acknowledgments from clients that have received the data packets, and determining which clients have problems communicating with the host 200.<br>
[0038]	Polling module 260 may automatically poll clients at periodic intervals.<br>
Polling module 260 may also be configured to poll clients when certain events occur, such as a new client joining the network session or an indication of interrupted communication (e.g., a client does not acknowledge data sent by host 200). The polling operation of polling module 260 may be akin to a periodic heartbeat like that described in U.S. patent publication number 2003-0204566 for a "Multi-User Application Program Interface," the disclosure of which has previously been incorporated by reference.<br><br><br>
[00391	Host 200 may also include a timer 270. Timer 270 may be configured to<br>
measure how much time has elapsed after an event. Host 200 may use timer 270 to<br>
determine the time between a data transmission like that generated by polling module<br>
260 and acknowledgement of that data transmission. Such information may be used to<br>
determine whether to terminate a connection to a particular client. If host 200 receives<br>
no acknowledgment or no poll response from a particular client for a period of time, as<br>
measured by timer 270, host 200 may terminate the connection with that client.<br>
[0040]	The application generated by the backup application module 250 may<br>
further include certain functionality similar to that of polling module 260 and timer 270. Unlike the host 200 that may be seeking to determine whether to eject a particular client from the network session, this 'heartbeat' functionality may be used by a client designated as a backup host to determine when the host 200 is no longer capable or has continuously failed to fulfill certain host duties. The inability or failure of a host 200 to fulfill certain duties may be indicated by a continued lack of receipt of an ACK or heartbeat as may be generated by acknowledgment module 220.<br>
[0041]	FIGURE 3A illustrates an implementation of an exemplary system 300 for<br>
network data distribution. Host 200 is connected to a plurality of clients 310A-D. Client 310A has successfully negotiated backup viability with host 200 and received host information through connection 320. Using the host information, client 310A connects to the other clients in the network, namely, clients 310B-D. Connections 330 allow for clients 310B-D to communicate directly (i.e., not through host 200) with client 310A. Clients 310B-D may use the connections 330 to exchange data with client 310A if each respective client has difficulty transmitting that data to the host 200. Clients 310B-D may also transmit data to client 310A automatically, irrespective of any difficulties with data transmissions to the host 200.<br>
[0042]	FIGURE 3B illustrates an alternate implementation of an exemplary<br>
system for network data distribution. In particular, FIGURE 3B illustrates an exemplary system for network data distribution where communications between a host 200 and a client 310D are interrupted. Specifically, the illustrated data transmission 340 between host 200 and client 310D is shown as being unsuccessful. While client 310D is<br><br><br>
attempting to send data transmission 340 to the host 200, a faulty connection prevents the transmission from ever being received by the host 200.<br>
[0043]	Because client 310A is a backup host for the network session, client 310D<br>
can send the same data intended for the host 200 in a backup data transmission 350 directly to client 310A (i.e., not through host 200). Client 310A may then send that data in a data transmission 360 to the host 200. Client 310A, in this particular embodiment, acts as a proxy between client 310D and host 200 due to the faulty connection separating client 310D and host 200. Host 200 may then distribute the data from client 310D to clients 310B and 310C albeit received via client 310A. Alternatively, client 310A may send the data to clients 310B or 310C if, for example, host 200 was unable to maintain    , host duties versus the connection between client 310D and host 200 simply being defective.<br>
[0044J	Because communications between the host 200 and client 310D has been<br>
disrupted, client 310D may need to obtain session data through client 310A. Client 310A may act as an intermediary for both the receipt and transmission of data with respect to host 200 and client 310D in addition to making requests for data on the behalf of either computing device.<br>
[0045]	FIGURE 4 is a flowchart depicting an exemplary method 400 for network<br>
data distribution. The steps identified in FIGURE 4 (and the order thereof) are<br>
exemplary and may include various alternatives, equivalents, or derivations thereof<br>
including but not limited to the order of execution of the same. The steps of the process<br>
of FIGURE 4 (and its various alternatives) may be embodied in hardware or software<br>
including a machine-readable or computer-readable storage medium (e.g., optical disc,<br>
memory card, or hard drive) including instructions executable by a processor.<br>
[0046]	In step 410, a host (e.g., host 200) establishes a network session. The host<br>
may set certain parameters for who may join the network session, as well as various<br>
aspects of how the network session will proceed. A host may establish a private<br>
network session that only certain clients or invited clients may join. Alternatively, the<br>
host may establish a network session that is open to the public and any client may join.<br>
[00471	In step 420, multiple clients join the network session by connecting to the<br>
host. If the host has set certain parameters concerning who may join the network<br><br><br>
session, the clients may need to satisfy those parameters before being allowed to connect the host or to participate in the network session.<br>
[0048]	In step 430, backup viability is negotiated via the negotiation module 220<br>
of FIGURE 2. One or more clients may be viable backup hosts with the capacity and resources to serve as a backup hosts. Backup viability may be negotiated as soon as a client joins the network session. Various aspects of backup viability, including bandwidth and quality of service, may be evaluated to determine whether a particular client is capable of serving as a backup host. Depending on the requirements of negotiation module 220, there may be one, more than one, or no viable backup hosts among the clients in the network session. Backup responsibilities may also be distributed.<br>
[0049]	In step 440, backup responsibility is allocated. Where there are multiple<br>
clients that are viable backup hosts, backup responsibility may need to be allocated among those clients with respect to order and/or particular responsibilities. Clients in the network session may transmit their data to the first viable backup host as may have been identified by the host or the first deemed backup through a broadcast or other communication as exemplified in U.S. patent publication number 2003-0217135 for "Dynamic Player Management," the disclosure of which has previously been incorporated by reference. If the first viable backup host is or becomes incapable of serving as a backup host, the other clients may transmit their data to the second viable backup host to join the network session. The need to communicate with a secondary backup host may be indicated utilizing means as disclosed herein and/or the aforementioned "Dynamic Player Management" application.<br>
[0050]	In step 450, it is determined whether a particular client can connect to<br>
each of the other clients in the network session. A backup host needs to be able to connect to each and every other client in the session. If a first client cannot connect to a second client, that first client cannot serve as a backup host for the network session. For example, the first client may have firewall issues that would prevent the first client from making certain types of connections. If a potential backup host cannot connect to another client for any reason, the method may return to step 440 and re-allocate backup responsibility.<br><br><br>
[0051]	Once it has been determined that a client is a viable backup host and can<br>
connect to all of the other clients in the network session, the method proceeds to step<br>
460. In step 460, backup information is downloaded to a viable backup host. By<br>
providing the backup information to a backup host, the host can drop out of the<br>
network, and the backup host is capable of providing any information required by the<br>
other clients in the network session. Backup information may be provided as a part of<br>
the download and installation of an application facilitating seamless host transitions as<br>
discussed in the context of backup application module 250 of FIGURE 2.<br>
[0052]	In step 470, network data distribution may commence. As illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 3A, the data transmissions may occur between a host and a client. As FIGURE<br>
3B further illustrates, data transmission may also occur between two clients, from a<br>
client with host connectivity issues to a client capable of acting as a backup host.<br>
Further, that backup host may forward that data on to the host or directly to the other<br>
clients upon request. Through whatever connection(s) the data must be relayed, the<br>
data is provided to those computing devices that require that data.<br>

In addition, modifications may be made without departing from the essential teachings of the present invention.
