				<td>RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/151,280 entitled "PROCESS FOR CONCENTRATING FLAVONOIDS FROM PLANTS" and filed August 27, 1999. The present application is also related to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/151,278 filed August 27, 1999 and is specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to dietary food supplements that are useful for the relief of pain or inflammation, and also for the inhibition of biochemical pathways related to pain or inflammation transmission. These food supplements contain flavonoids, and more particularly, certain anthocyanins.<br>
Today, many consumers seek natural alternatives to synthetic pharmaceutical products to aid with a variety of ailments experienced during daily life. Thus, dietary food supplements containing natural substances such as St. Johns wort, gingko biloba, ginseng, and others have recently been marketed for a variety of purposes. To date, however, it is believed that no product containing natural substances is available to provide for the relief of pain and/or inflammation equivalent to non¬steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs").<br>
At the present, pain and inflammation are commonly treated by the use of aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin®, Advil®), and other similar substances commonly known as NSAIDs. Inflammation is transmitted, in part, by a class of compounds known as prostaglandins, which are released by a host in response to mechanical, thermal, chemical, bacterial, and other insults (Moncada et a/., Handbook of Exp. Pharm. Vol 50-1, Springer Verlag, pp 588-616, 1978; Samuelsson, Science, 220: 568-575, 1983; Davies era/., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2:335-357, 1984). Prostaglandin synthesis is accomplished in a stepwise manner by a ubiquitous complex of microsomal enzymes. The first enzyme in this biosynthetic pathway is prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase. This enzyme also is referred to in the art as fatty acid cyciooxygenase. There are two isoforms of this enzyme known as cyclooxygenase-<br><br>
1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), respectively (Smith, Am. J. Physiol., 268:F181-F191, 1992).<br>
Although substances such as aspirin inhibit prostaglandin production and thus, pain or inflammation, they may cause stomach problems and or ulcers. To address these problems, drugs have been developed to target specific pain pathways in the hope that some of the problems associated with aspirin, ibuprofen, and other similar substances will be reduced if not completely eliminated. One such drug is Celebrex™, which apparently targets a specific pain pathway and thus, does not have some of the disadvantages associated with substances such as aspirin. In particular, NSAIDs prevent the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway. Drugs like Celebrex™, however, distinguish between COX-1 and COX-2 and are touted as having less of the side effects associated with normal NSAIDs.<br>
As noted above, many consumers prefer natural substances to synthetic drugs. In this regard, one approach identified in PCT WO 00.33824 describes a mixture of anthocyanins, bioflavonoids, and phenolics for use as anti-inflammatory      i agenets as a result of inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes. Similarly, Wang et . al., Antioxidant and anti-Inflammatory compounds in fan* cherries (antrtocyanins, phenolics, fJavonoids, Balaton, Montmorency), Dissertation Abstract. XP002137469 (1998) describe compounds obtained from cherries and describe that a hydrolyzed     ^ anthocyanin, cyanidin exhibited inhibitory activity against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.<br>
U.S. Pats. Nos. 4,376,781 and 4,258,055 describe pharmaceutical properties of flavyluim salts (organic salts of anthocyanidins) that include anti-inflammatory, vaso-protective, hypolipaemic, hypocholesterolaemic and hypoglycaemic activities.<br>
Loggia et al., anti-Inflammatory Activity of Benzopyrones that are inhibitors of Cycio and L/po-Oxygenase, Pharamcological Research Communications, Vol. 20, Supplement V, 91-94 (1988) describes the topical lipooxygenase activity of quercitin, kaempferol, and esculetin<br>
Therefore, it is clear that there is a need for a natural and pharmacologically acceptable anti-inflammatory composition that desirably preferentially inhibits COX-2 enzyme. The present invention addresses that need by providing a dietary food supplement containing an extract from one or more plant materials of the genus Vaccinium having a native active fraction that provides pain relief, anti-inflammation<br><br>
activity, and/or preferential COX-2 inhibition. The supplement contains an amount of the fraction in a proportion by dry weight of other components that significantly exceeds a proportion of the fraction present by dry weight in juice obtained from the plant material. In general, the active fraction includes fiavonoids, and in particular, anthocyanins.<br>

FIG. 1 shows a flow sheet of one embodiment of a process for obtaining and concentrating desirable anthocyanins from anthocyanin-containing plants.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prostaglandins (which include PGE2, PGDZ, PGF2| PGI2 and other related compounds) represent a diverse group of autocrine and paracrine hormones that are derived from the metabolism of fatty acids. They belong to a family of naturally occurring eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes) that are not stored as such in cells, but are biosynthesized on demand from arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon fatty acid that is derived from the breakdown of cell-membrane phospholipids. Under normal circumstances, the eicosanoids are produced at low levels to serve as important mediators of many and diverse cellular functions which can be very different in different types of cells. The prostaglandins, however, also play critical roles in pathophysiology. In particular, inflammation is both initiated and maintained, at least in part, by the overproduction of prostaglandins in injured cells. The central role that prostaglandins play in inflammation is underscored by the fact that those aspirin-like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that are most effective in the therapy of many pathological inflammatory states all act by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Unfortunately, the use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects (gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, renal failure, and others) that result from the undesirable reduction in prostaglandins in normal cells that now suffer from a lack of those autocrine and paracrine functions that are required for the maintenance of normal physiology. The development of new agents that will act more specifically by achieving a reduction in prostaglandins in inflamed cells without altering prostaglandin production in other cells is a goal for future pain and inflammation therapy.<br>
The cycfooxygenase reaction is the first step in the prostaglandin synthetic pathway; an enzyme (PGHS) with prostaglandin G/H synthetic activity converts<br>
^M£WBEB-SHEE^<br><br>
arachidonic acid into the endoperoxide PGG2, which then breaks down to PGH2 (the two reactions are carried out by a single enzyme). PGH2 is in turn metabolized by one or more prostaglandin synthase (PGE2 synthase, PGD2 synthase etc.) to generate the final "2-series" prostaglandins, PGE2, PGD2, PGF2, PGI2 and others that include the thromboxanes, TXA2. The first step (PGHS) is the one that is rate-limiting for prostaglandin synthesis. As such, the PGHS-mediated reaction is the principal target for anti-infiammatory drug action; and it is inhibition of PGHS activity that accounts for the activity of the NSAIDS (aspirin, acetominophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin) and others that limit the overproduction of prostaglandins in inflammation (the desired therapeutic goal) and reduce the normal production of prostaglandins in uninflamed cells (which produces the undesirable side effects).<br>
In addition to the abnormal changes associated with inflammation, multiple other factors are known to influence prostaglandin production under experimental conditions. These include growth factors, cAMP, tumor promoters, src activation and interleukins 1 and 2, all of which increase overall cellular PGHS activity. The adrenal glucocorticoid hormones and related synthetic anti-inflammatory steroids also inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, but their metabolic site of action is not well defined.<br>
The primary and perhaps sole action of most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents is to inhibit the enzyme prostaglandin G/H synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase, which serves as the first committed step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.<br>
It is well established that cyclooxygenase exists in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. The constitutively expressed form, COX-1, has been extensively studied and proposed to be involved in the maintenance of prostaglandin mediated physiological functions. In contrast, COX-2, the inducible form, is present in negligible amounts under normal conditions but is substantially induced in vivo under inflammatory conditions. Cleariy, COX-1 and COX-2 serve different physiological and pathological functions.<br>
The most widely available NSAlDs are non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, inhibiting both isoforms indiscriminately. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have been sought ever since it was discovered that the enzyme has two distinct isoforms. More recently, COX-2 specific inhibitors have been developed but it has been suggested that they have side effects. There is a need for a safe and effective method of treating inflammation. The present invention addresses such a need.<br><br>
The present invention describes a natural alternative to NSAIDs that preferentially inhibits for COX-2 activity and ameliorates inflammation mediated by COX-2. The invention shows that certain fruit extracts possess an anti-infiammatory activity greater than the anti-infiammatory activity found in the natural fruit. This observation is exploited to provide a food supplement that comprises a fruit extract having an anti-inflammatory activity greater than the anti-inflammatory activity found in the natural fruit and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable diluent or excipient. In other words, the present invention provides extracts obtained from anthocyanin-containing plants, particularly fruits, to provide selective COX-2 inhibition.<br>
Alternatively, extracts from anthocyanin-containing plants may selectively inhibit activity of COX-1. Accordingly, the present invention contemplates a food supplement that contains at least one anthocyanin derived from an extract of an anthocyanin-containing plant to selectively inhibit activity of COX-1 or COX-2.<br>
More particularly, in one embodiment, it is found that elderberry and chokeberry extracts have a high anti-inflammatory activity. This anti-inflammatory activity, mediated by anthocyanin compounds in the fruit extracts (particularly when hydrolyzed), provides a greater inhibition of COX-2 as compared to the inhibition of COX-1. Methods and compositions exploiting this observation are described in further detail herein below. Generally speaking, however, the extracts of this embodiment are selected from anthocyanin-containing plants and selectively inhibit activity of COX, preferably COX-2. It is believed that when the extracts are orally ingested by a mammal, the anthocyanins that are present will be hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding anthocyanidins, which will provide COX inhibition, in specific embodiments, it has been found that the certain fruits have an anti-inflammatory activity that is preferential for COX-2 as compared to COX-1. In particularly preferred aspects of the present invention it is desirable to obtain a fruit extract that has an anti-inflammatory activity having a COX-2/COX-1 ratio of between about 2:1 to about 25:1. In certain embodiments it was found that tart cherry extract had a COX-2/COX-1 ratio of about 4.6:1, chokeberry had a ratio of about 7.5:1, elderberry had a ratio of about 10.1:1. Indeed, in certain aspects, it may be that this anti¬inflammatory activity is greater than the anti-inflammatory activity of Celebrex™, a well recognized synthetic COX-2 inhibitor.<br>
Thus it is contemplated that an extract from chokeberry, elderberry, bilberry, tart cherry, or mixtures thereof will have beneficial anti-inflammatory properties. In<br><br>
specific embodiments, a nutritional supplement is contemplated which comprises one of these fruit extracts. Alternatively, food supplements comprising two or more such fruit extracts are contemplated. By way of comparison it was found that Celebrex™ a pharmaceutical anti-inflammatory agent purported to have COX-2 specific inhibitory activity had a COX-2/COX-1 inhibitory activity ratio of 7.0.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, a nutritional dietary or food supplement includes from 0.1% to 99%, preferably from 5% to 95%, desirably from 10% to 90%, and more preferably from 30% to 90% of an anthocyanin-containing extract. The amount of the anthocyanin-containing extract may be provided by any of the anthocyanin-containing fruit, extracts identified above, as well as by any other anthocyanin-containing plant, extract.<br>
In this regard, a single dosage form (i.e., a single tablet, capsule, serving (whether liquid or solid)} contains from 1 mg. to 500 mg. of total anthocyanin, preferably from 5 mg. to 100 mg., more preferably from 20 mg. to 70 mg. of total anthocyanin. In a presently preferred formulation, a tablet (a single dosage form) is provided that contains 50 mg. of total anthocyanin. The phrase "total anthocyanin" refers to the total amount of anthocyanin present in the single dosage form.<br>
The dietary or food supplement of the present invention provides an amount of an anti-inflammatory active ingredient for a single dosage form in the range of 0.1% to 99%, preferably from 5% to 95%, desirably from 10% to 90%, and more preferably from 30% to 90%. The anti-inflammatory active ingredient may be from an anthocyanin-containing plant, extract or from a plant or extract (e.g. ginger, boswellia) that provides anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
A.       Anthocyanins as Natural Alternatives to NSAIDs<br>
There is a growing need for dietary supplements that contain beneficial<br>
phytochemicals that are naturally found in plants. These naturally occurring phytochemicals can be classified in several different groups. One of the more important groups is the flavonoids, which in turn, can be classified into several groups.  One important group of flavonoids is the anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are most prevalent in the flowers and fruits that are red, blue, and intermediate colored<br><br>
such as cherries (sweet, sour (or tart)), acerala cherry, blue plums, bilberry, blackberry, currant, chokeberry, blueberry, strawberry, cranberry, boysenberry, grapes, raspberry, and elderberry. Anthocyanins have been found to be useful as antioxidants. The present invention describes the use of anthocyanins to confer an anti-inflammatory activity to food supplements.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the anthocyanins are obtained from an extract of an anthocyanin-containing plant. Methods to determine whether a plant contains anthocyanins are known and therefore, not discussed here. Examples of suitable anthocyanin-containing plants include fruits selected from the group consisting of sweet cherry, tart cherry, acerola cherry, plum, bilberry, blackberry, currant, chokeberry, blueberry, strawberry, cranberry, boysenberry, grapes, raspberry, elderberry, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Anthocyanins that may be useful in providing an anti-inflammatory activity include, but are not limited to, cyanidin-3-glucoside; cyanidin 3-glucosylrutinoside; cyanidin-3-gentibioside; cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-sambunigrin, cyanidin-3-samb-5-giucoside, cyanidin-3-galactoside, peonidin-3-rutinoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-galactoside, peonidin, cyanidin, cyanidin-3 sophoroside, pelargonidin, delphinidin, delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-galactoside, petunidin, petunidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-galactoside, malvidin, malvidin-3-arabinoside, malvidin-3-glucoside, maividin-3-galactoside, kaempferol, hesperidin, gentiodelphin, platyconin, cinerarin and the like.<br>
The chemistry of these materials is based on 2-phenylbenzopyrylium (flavylium) having the following structure:<br><br>
If this basic formula is substituted with hydroxy or methoxy groups at 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 3' or 5', the resultant compounds are known as anthocyanidins, which are water insoluble, unstable to light and rapidly destroyed by alkali and thus not. foundJop_ often in plants. However, anthocyanins are the glycosides of the above compounds<br><br>
and are more stable and found as native substances in the leaves, flowers and fruits of plants. Thus, the anthocyanins are hydrolyzed to produce anthocyanidins (the aglycone form) and sugars.<br>
The total number of anthocyanins found in nature is extremely large, since many mono, di and tri-saccharides may be glycosylated at the 3, 5 or 7 positions and also since the sugar at position 3 may be acylated (often with p-coumaric acid). Thus, a particular fruit may have 20 or more anthocyanins including the 3,5-diglucosides, the 3-mono-glucoside, the 3-(6-0-p-coumaryl-glucoside)-5-glucosides and the 3-(6-0-p-coumaryl-glucoside) of cyanidin, delphinldin, petunidin, pelargonidin and malvidin. The color of anthocyanins is determined by their molecular structure and the physiochemical nature of the medium in which they are present.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the extract contains one or more anthocyanins selected from the group consisting of peonidin, cyanidin, pelargonidin, delphinidin, petunnidin, malvidin, kaempferol, hesperidin, gentiodelphin, platyconin, cinerarin, their glycoside derivatives, and mixtures thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the anthocyanins are selected from the group consisting of cyanidin, peonidin, malvidin, petunidin, delphinidin, their glycoside derivatives, and mixtures thereof.<br>
It has been found that the hydrolyzed anthocyanin, the anthocyanidin, provides greater COX inhibition activity as compared to the anthocyanin and its glycoside derivatives. As a result, the present invention is believed to provide an advantage over currently available COX inhibitors, such as NSAIDs. it is believed that the anthocyanins provide little, if any, COX inhibition, particularly COX-1 inhibition. Therefore, if a food supplement containing an anthocyanin is ingested, there will be little inhibition of the COX-1 in the gastrointestinal ("GI") tract, with a possible reduction in side effects. B.       Methods for Extracting Anthocyanins<br>
There are various methods for the extraction of anthocyanins known to those of skill in the art. Some of these methods are described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,817,354; U.S. Patent No. 5,200,186; U.S. Patent No. 5,912,363; U.S. Patent    ■ No. 4,211,577; U.S. Patent No. 4,302,200 (each incorporated herein by reference).   :<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,817,354 describes a process for removing flavonoids from  j citrus products that cause the bitter taste. The process includes contacting a fluid<br><br>
■ontaining one or more these bitter flavonoids with a polystyrene divinylbenzene resin to bind the flavonoids to the resin. Generally, a centrifugation or ultrafiltration step is used before contacting with the polystyrene divinylbenzene resin. The flavonoids can then be collected by eluting from the resin. While this patent does not describe how the flavonoids can be eluted (removed) from the resin, Chandra, et al. (J. Agric. Food Chem., 1062-64, Vol. 41, No. 7 (1993)) describe the use of ethanol to elute the anthocyanins. The eluted solution is then vacuum dried to remove the ethanol.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,912,363 describes a method for the extraction of proanthocyanidins from plant material. The method involves heating an aqueous mixture of solid plant material, optionally under increased pressure and reduced oxygen followed by various separation, filtration and adsorption steps, and the elution of adsorbed proanthocyanidins with polar solvent. This method also is amenable to reconstituting and recycling the polar solvent into the elution phase of the method, resulting in decreased solvent consumption and a more cost-effective process.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,211,577 describes the extraction of plant anthocyanin colors by treating impure materials to insure discrete monomeric anthocyanin molecules in solution and then passing the solution through ultrafiltration membranes to retain soluble and/or cloudy macromolecular, e.g., colloidal, impurities upstream that produce, an aging, haze and sediments, and passing the monomeric anthocyanins downstream for further concentration as liquid or powder to give a stable color concentrate that can be used as a color additive. In this manner, fruit solids may be treated with sulfur dioxide solutions to ionize, decolor and insure the monomeric state of the pigment molecules (change from anthocyanins to chromon 2-and 4-sulfonates). Ultrafiltering the solution to pass the anthocyanins downstream while retaining upstream the macromolecular components such as pectins, tannins, proteins, complexes thereof, etc. Optionally stripping of the sulfur dioxide from the ultrafiltered solution regenerates the original anthocyanins from the chromen sulfonates. The anthocyanins can then be concentrated by evaporation to a highly concentrated liquid from which unstable pigments with acyl groups in the molecule may optionally be removed by controlled precipitation at reduced temperatures.<br>
. U.S. Patent 4,302,200 describes a process for the extraction of anthocyanins from a natural product by bringing the natural product containing the anthocyanin<br><br>
into contact with a sulfite ion-containing aqueous solution at a temperature of 85°C or higher for 30 minutes or less, at which time the sulfite ion content of the aqueous solution firstly contacting the natural product is adjusted to at least 10,000 ppm in terms of SO2.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,963,700 describes a method of recovering anthocyanins from plant materials such as grape wastes using a tartaric acid-alkanol extraction followed by controlled precipitation of excess tartaric acid as potassium hydrogen tartrate. This patent further describes the use of these anthocyanins in the preparation of an artificial grape drink colored with the anthocyanin extract.<br>
While it is contemplated that the methods described in the above patents will be useful in generating the anthocyanins for the anti-inflammatory properties described herein, the inventors have developed another method of extraction of anthocyanins from a natural source.<br>
The method is directed to concentrating flavonoids from plants without the use of undesirable chemicals. The process includes passing a solution containing one or more flavonoids through an ultrafiltration membrane to provide a supernatant and a retentate. The supernatant is then passed through a reverse osmosis membrane to provide a retentate and a permeate, and then the reverse osmosis retentate is collected.<br>
The molecular weight cutoff of the ultrafiltration membrane is preferably in the range of 100,000 to 1,000,000. The molecular weight cutoff of the reverse osmosis membrane is preferably in the range from 1,000 to 10,000.<br>
The collected retentate contains the anti-inflammatory, COX-2 inhibiting properties that are described in the present invention. In preferred embodiments the retentate may thus be dried and combined with one or more excipients to provide a dietary supplement.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a flow sheet of one embodiment of the process according to the present invention. In accordance with this embodiment, a plant source 1, particularly a fruit containing flavonoids and more particularly a fruit containing anthocyanin compounds is processed by an extraction method 10 to obtain an extract or juice 2. For example, the plant may be subjected to a juicing operation or a pressing operation such as a screw or bag press to obtain a cake and a juice. Alternatively, the raw plant may be ground, pulverized or subjected to<br><br>
process to increase the surface area of the plant to facilitate the extraction and separation of the desired flavonoid compounds from the bulk solids<br>
To aid in this separation and to obtain a better ultimate recovery of the desired anthocyanin compounds, it may be desirable to contact the plant with an extractant 3 to obtain an extract (juice) rich in flavonoids (particularly the anthocyanin compounds) and to form a bulk solid residue or cake 4. Preferably, the extractant is water in order to minimize further separation processing steps. The extracting step may be done using conventional extraction equipment, in countercurrent fashion, batch, or multiple batch extraction.<br>
In addition, the cake may likewise be subjected to an extraction process to increase the recovery of the desired anthocyanin compounds. If this extraction process step is conducted, it may be desirable to combine the extract from this step with the juice and/or extract (juice) from the previous step.<br>
The juice may separated from the cake in any known manner using bulk separation apparatus such as a centrifuge, screen, press, or filter. Prior to ultrafiltration, the bulk solids are desirably separated from the liquid by any known bulk separation apparatus. For example, the following may be used a centrifuge, filter, screen, press, etc.<br>
Thereafter, an ultrafiltration process 20 is used to remove suspended particles and colloidal high molecular weight components having a molecular weight greater than 200,000 Daltons. The ultrafiltration membrane can be a tubular type, a capillary type, spiral type, hollow fiber, or other suitable type. The membrane can be polysulphone, polyacrylonitrite, poiyethersulphone, PVDF or other suitable material. Preferably, the ultrafiltration is conducted using cross-flow. The molecular weight cut off of the membrane can range from 20,000 Daltons to 300,000 Daltons, preferably 200,000 Daltons. If there is no filtration before the ultrafilter, it is preferred to use a higher molecular weight cut off membrane so that an acceptable filtration rate can be achieved. Thus, it is contemplated to incorporate a microfiltration step before the<br>
ultrafiltration step.<br>
For example, a microfilter may be used to remove suspended particles having a size in the range from 0.01 to 1 micrometer.<br>
The ultrafiltration can be conducted under a pressure of 5 to 25 bar and at a temperature of 20°C. to 80" C This step primarily removes the lipids, proteins and like colloids, cell fragments, starch, etc. with the advantage that the following RO<br><br>
step can be carried out free of the contamination of the membrane(s) that would otherwise lead to a reduced filtration rate.<br>
The ultrafiltration step results in a permeate 5 rich in anthocyanin compounds and a retentate 7 containing undesirable compounds. To increase the ultimate recovery of the flavonoids and desired anthocyanin compounds, a difiltrate 6 may be provided to the ultrafiltration membrane.<br>
The ultrafiltration permeate 5 is subjected to reverse osmosis 30 to provide a retentate 8 rich in flavonoids, including the anthocyanin compounds, and a permeate 10, which is substantially free of the flavonoids, including the anthocyanin compounds. To increase the ultimate recovery of the flavonoids and desired anthocyanin compounds, a difiltrate 9 may be provided to the ultrafiltration membrane. The membrane to be used for the RO of the present invention can be polyethersulphone, polysulphone, cellulose acetate, or a polyamide film.<br>
The reverse osmosis can be conducted at a pressure from 30 to 70 bar and at a temperature from 30° C. to 80° C, preferably the temperature is maintained in the range from 30° C. to 45" C. In general, the reverse osmosis membrane has a molecular weight cutoff in the range from 1 ,QQQ to 10,000, preferably 2,000 to provide a retentate.<br>
The retentate contains a higher concentration of the desired anthocyanin compounds than found in the starting plant material. The retentate may be left in the form of a solution but also may be further concentrated by drying 40 to remove some of the water or may be completely dried to form a powder 11.<br>
Where a more concentrated solution is desired, some of the water may be removed by conventional means including use of reverse osmosis membranes having greater than 90% NaCI retention.<br>
Spray drying is the preferred drying means but other drying methods, e.g. flash drying, freeze drying, fluidized bed drying, ring drying, micron drying, tray drying, vacuum drying, radio-frequency drying, or microwave drying, may also be adapted for use in this drying step.<br>
Before drying, it may be desirable to add one or more flow control agents such as maltodextrin (e.g. M100), magnesium hydroxide or other known flow controls agents or carriers. In genera], it may be desirable to add a flow control agent in an amount from 20 to 60% by weight of the solid content in the retentate.<br><br>
When spray drying is used, the total solids content of the retentate should be at least 1%, based on the total slurry weight although higher total solids content in the range of at least 20% to 35% solids would be desired. The higher solids content levels are desirable since the amount of water that must be removed during the drying step is accordingly reduced. Consequently, the solids content of the retentate will be as high as can be achieved and yet allow efficient processing conditions. The upper limit on solids content in the retentate is typically determined by the operating constraints of the membrane used in the reverse osmosis/nanofiltration step as well as the drying apparatus used.<br>
The temperature of the retentate is not critical. Ambient temperatures, of from 10-25" C, will generally be preferred. Higher slurry temperatures may be used, and these may be desirable with certain types of drying equipment.<br>
Conventional spray drying equipment may be used, and operating procedures that are familiar to those experienced in the spray drying art are applicable to the spray-drying step of this process. Drier (drier gas) outlet temperature is ordinarily used to control the residual moisture level obtained in the resulting powder. In a spray drying process, drier outlet temperatures are ordinarily in the range of 40-100° C. In general, it is desirable to maintain the outlet temperature to less than 80°C to minimize the potential for degradation of the desired anthocyanin compounds. It is understood that the corresponding drier inlet temperatures are higher, ordinarily in the range of 90° C. to 200° C, but preferably less than 150" C.<br>
The product recovered from the drying operation is a free-flowing particulate solid that typically has a fine granular powder appearance and is suitable for use as a dietary or food supplement. In this regard, the resulting powder containing the desired one or more anthocyanin compounds is useful as a food or dietary<br>
supplement.<br>
The reverse osmosis permeate may be further processed by, for example, a concentrator 50 to provide a concentrate 12 that may be used to prepare a fruit<br>
drink.<br>
Of course the above is only one method and it should be understood that any method, which provide fruit extracts possessing an anti-inflammatory activity greater than the anti-inflammatory activity found in the natural fruit, will be useful in the context of the present invention.<br><br>
Although any of the above methods are suitable for obtaining the desired anthocyanin, it is also contemplated that commercially available extracts may be used for some or all of the requirements of the products of the present invention. As an example, it is known that Artemis International of Fort Wayne, IN supplies juice concentrates and powders that contain anthocyanins and other flavonoids. Where commercial products are used, it is preferred that the anthocyanin content in the extract is at least 10% by weight of the extract product.<br>
C.       Identification of Anthocyanin and Novel Anti-inflammatory compounds<br>
The above describes methods of extracting an anti-inflammatory activity from<br>
fruit extracts wherein the extract contains a higher anti-inflammatory activity than the<br>
crude fruit. Given these teachings, it also wiil be possible to obtain purified<br>
compositions comprising novel compounds that confer such an anti-inflammatory<br>
activity on the fruit extracts. The present section is directed towards providing a    ?<br>
general teaching of the purification and identification of such compound(s).	J<br>
In general the fruit extract is prepared as described herein above. This fruit extract will comprise a mixture of flavonoid compounds some of which will have COX-2 selective activity, others of which will have COX-1 selective activity, still others which wilt have a broad spectrum cyciooxygenase inhibitory activity and still others which will not have any appreciable inhibitory activity of cyciooxygenase inhibition.<br>
Upon demonstrating that a particular fruit extract has an anti-inflammatory activity, using for example the assays described herein below or other equivalent assays known to those of skill in the art for measuring COX activity, it will be possible to separate the individual components of the fruit extract. Separation techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, those of skill in the art may employ chromatography such as thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, paper chromatography, affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, supercritical flow chromatography and the like to separate the individual flavonoid components (See Freifelder, Physical Biochemistry Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2nd ed., Wm. Freeman and Co., New York, N.Y., 1982 for an overview of chromatographic techniques).<br><br>
r<br><br>
Partition chromatography is based on the theory that if two phases are in contact with one another, and if one or both phases constitute a solute, the soiute will distribute itself between the two phases. Usually, partition chromatography employs a column that is filled with a sorbent and a solvent. The solution containing the solute is layered on top of the column. The solvent is then passed through the column, continuously, which permits movement of the solute through the column material. The solute can then be collected based on is movement rate. The two most common types of partition chromatograph are paper chromatograph and thin-layer chromatograph (TLC); together these are called adsorption chromatography. In both cases, the matrix contains a bound liquid. Other examples of partition chromatography as gas-liquid and gel chromatography.<br>
Paper chromatography is a variant of partition chromatography that is performed on cellulose columns in the form of a paper sheet. Cellulose contains a large amount of bound water even when extensively dried. Partitioning occurs between the bound water and the developing solvent. Frequently, the solvent used is water. Usually, very small volumes of the solution mixture to be separated is piaced at top of the paper and allowed to dry. Capillarity draws the solvent through the paper, dissolves the sample, and moves the components in the direction of flow. Paper chromatograms may be developed for either ascending or descending solvent flow. Two dimensional separations are permitted by changing the axis of migration 90° after the first run.<br>
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is very commonly used to separate lipids and, therefore, is considered a preferred embodiment of the present invention. TLC has the advantages of paper chromatography, but allows the use of any substance that can be finely divided and formed into a uniform layer. In TLC, the stationary phase is a layer of sorbent spread uniformly over the surface of a glass or plastic plate. The plates are usually made by forming a slurry of sorbent that is poured onto the surface of the gel after creating a well by placing tape at a selected height along the perimeter of the plate. After the sorbent dries, the tape is removed and the plate is treated just as paper in paper chromatography. The sample is applied and the plate is contacted with a solvent. Once the solvent has almost reached the end of the plate, the plate is removed and dried. Spots can then be identified by fluorescence, immunologic identification, counting of radioactivity, or by spraying varying reagents onto the surface to produce a color change.<br><br>
TLC of anthocyant'ns from bilberry extracts is described by Petri et a!., (1994) This reference also describes additional spectrophotmethc and chromatographic techniques that can be used in the identification and characterization of anthocyanin agents.<br>
In gas liquid chromatography (GLC), the mobile phase is a gas and the stationary phase is a liquid adsorbed either to the inner surface of a tube or column or to a solid support. The liquid usually is applied as a solid dissolved in a volatile solvent such as ether. The sample, which may be any sample that can be volatized, is introduced as a liquid with an inert gas, such as helium, argon or nitrogen, and then heated. This gaseous mixture passes through the tubing. The vaporized compounds continually redistribute themselves between the gaseous mobile phase and the liquid stationary phase, according to their partition coefficients.<br>
The advantage of GLC is in the separation of small molecules. Sensitivity and speed are quite good, with speeds that approach 1000 times that of standard liquid chromatography. By using a non-destructive detector, GLC can be used preparatively to purify grams quantities of material.<br>
Gel chromatography, or molecular sieve chromatography, is a special type of partition chromatography that is based on molecular size. The theory behind gel chromatography is that the column, which is prepared with tiny particles of an inert substance that contain small pores, separates larger moiecules from smaller molecules as they pass through or around the pores, depending on their size. As long as the material of which the particles are made does not adsorb the molecules, the sole factor determining rate of flow is the size. Hence, molecuies are eluted from the column in decreasing size, so long as the shape is relatively constant. Ge! chromatography is unsurpassed for separating molecules of different size because separation is independent of all other factors such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, etc. There also is virtually no adsorption, less zone spreading and the elution volume is related in a simple matter to molecular weight.<br>
The ge! material for gel chromatography is a three-dimensional network whose structure is usually random. The gels consist of cross-linked polymers that are generally inert, do not bind or react with the material being analyzed, and are uncharged. The space filled within the gel is filled with liquid and this liquid occupies most of the gel volume. Common gels are dextran, agarose and polyacrylamide; they are used for aqueous solution.<br><br>
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is characterized by a very rapid separation with extraordinary resolution of peaks. This is achieved by the use of very fine particles and high pressure to maintain an adequate flow rate. Separation can be accomplished in a matter of minutes, or at most an hour. Moreover, only a very small volume of the sample is needed because the particles are so small and close-packed that the void volume is a very small fraction of the bed volume. Also, the concentration of the sample need not be very great because the bands are so narrow that there is very little dilution of the sample. HPLC set up with a photodiode array detection system has been used to study fiavonoids such as rutin and other quercetin glycosides, phloridzin, as well as certain anthocyanins (Paganga and Rice-Evans, FEBS Lett. 401(1):78-82, 1997). A reverse phase-HPLC gradient procedure has been described for the separation and quantitative estimation of 12 anthocyanins (Petri et aL, Acta Pharm. Hung. 64(4) 117-122, 1994). Quercetin compounds also may be identified using the HPLC techniques described by Laires et a/., (Food Chem. Toxicol., 31(12) 989-994, 1993). It is contemplated that such methods may be adapted to the present invention in characterizing and identifying novel fiavonoids.<br>
Affinity Chromatography is a chromatographic procedure that relies on the specific affinity between a substance to be isolated and a molecule that it can specifically bind to. This is a receptor-ligand type interaction. The column material is synthesized by covaiently coupling one of the binding partners to an insoluble matrix. The column material is then able to specifically adsorb the substance from the solution. Elution occurs by changing the conditions to those in which binding will not occur (alter pH, ionic strength, temperature, etc.).<br>
The matrix should be a substance that itself does not adsorb molecules to any significant extent and that has a broad range of chemical, physical and thermal stability. The ligand should be coupled in such a way as to not affect its binding properties. The ligand should also provide relatively tight binding. And it should be possible to elute the substance without destroying the sample or the ligand. One of the most common forms of affinity chromatography is immunoaffinity chromatography which employs antibodies directed against the particular materials to be detected.<br>
The structure of anthocyanins separated using the above techniques can be identified by generating mass spectra and NMR spectra as described by Saito ef a/.,<br><br><phytochemistry41 and phytochemistry43 takeda etal. additional nmr techniques are described byterahara biotech. biochem. nerdal era chem. scand. johansen et a describe various methods including ion-exchange resin droplet-counter chromatography gel filtration for the isolation of anthocyanins subsequent use such as chemical degradation spectroscopy especially homo-and heteronuclear two-dimensional characterization isolated anthocyanin compounds. it will be clear to those skill in art that any above can used isolate further purify fruit extracts herein identify individual compounds responsible anti-inflammatory activity.></phytochemistry41>
D.       Assays to Test for Anti-inflammatory Activity<br>
In the present invention, it is described that anthocyanin-containing fruit extracts have an anti-inflammatory activity. More particularly, it is demonstrated that such extracts inhibit COX-2 activity preferentially over COX-1 activity. As such these extracts provide an excellent alternative to the traditional NSAIDs in that they are selective for COX-2. These inhibitory extracts are further advantageous over the recently developed, COX-2 specific "super aspirins" because these extracts are natural extracts that have not been linked to increased propensity for heart attacks, strokes, and other adverse cardiovascular events.<br>
The concentration of any inhibitor that inhibits the enzyme to 50% of its maximal activity is called (C50or l5o- The smaller the \C50, the stronger or more potent the corresponding inhibitor is for the enzyme inhibition. Consequently, a smaller amount of inhibitor would be required for anti-inflammatory and pain-relief supplement formulation if the compound can be absorbed, metabolized, transported to the malfunctional or diseased site.<br>
Some materials, compounds, or plant concentrates may selectively inhibit either COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme. This can be referred to as selectivity of the material. The selectivity can be numerically expressed by the ratio of l5o (COX-1 )/l5o (COX-2). When the ratio is equal to 1, the inhibitor has no selectivity for either of the isozymes; i.e. the inhibitor is equally inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. When<br><br>
the ratio is less than 1, the inhibitor is more selective for COX-1 inhibition. When the ratio is more than 1, the inhibitor is more selective for COX-2 inhibition. For chronic anti-inflammatory and pain-relief drugs or supplements, the selectivity may piay a key role in side effects. The side effects are mostly gastrointestinal (Gl) bleeding caused by the inhibition of COX-1 enzyme on the Gl tract where prostaglandins have a normal function on Gl lining.<br>
The selectivity is an important issue in non-sterol anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), because NSAIDs only have one active form that can inhibit constitutively expressed COX 1 enzyme in Gl tract and cause Gl bleeding, in addition to the expected action of absorption and transportation to the inflammatory and pain sites. Though not yet proven, natural products, such as anthocyanin-containing plant extracts, may have an advantage because they have non-active and active forms and therefore, may not cause side effects in Gl tract. Different mechanisms of absorption, metabolism and transportation may exist. It is possible that the non-active form (glycosidic form with sugar) can be absorbed or passed through the Gl tract without inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme there. As a result, the amount of prostaglandins generated by COX 1 enzyme on the Gl tract is normal or high enough to maintain the Gl lining. After the absorption, the sugar moiety is cleaved and the active form (aglycone form, anthocyanidin) is transported to the site where COX 2 enzyme is induced at great level, although COX 1 will be inhibited as well (but to a lesser degree). The inhibition of both enzymes on the site will be very effective in anti-inflammation and pain relief.<br>
In certain aspects of the present invention, it will be necessary to determine whether a particular fruit extract or a component thereof possesses an anti¬inflammatory activity. Such an activity may be measured using- anti-inflammatory assays well known to those of skill in the art. The use of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 and -2 isozymes will allow a facile determination of whether a particular extract has the appropriate activity. These assays determine the ability of these enzymes to convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Alternatively, an immunoassay method as described below may be used.<br>
Reagents such as arachidonic acid and microsomal suspension of the COX-1, and COX-2 enzymes are readily available to those of skill in the art (e.g., from Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, Ml, USA).<br><br>
Accordingly, COX-2 inhibitory activity of a particular extract may be measured using a method including generally the steps of (a) obtaining a COX-2 microsomal composition; (b) admixing the candidate extract with the COX-2 microsomal composition; and (c) determining the ability of the candidate extract to inhibit the COX-2 activity.<br>
COX-2 activity may be measured by obtaining a microsomal membrane preparation of COX-2 e.g., (5-10 mg protein/ml in an appropriate buffer). COX-2 assay is performed at 37°C by monitoring the rate of 02 uptake as described (DeWitt etai., Am. J. Med. 95(2A) 40S-44S, 1993; Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 306(1) 96-102; 1993). This assay basically measures the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxide -2. Thus, one unit of cyciooxygenase activity represents the oxygenation of 1 nmol of arachidonic acid/minute (DeWitt ef a/., 1993 supra). Alternatively, the activity of COX-2 may be measured using chromatography by determining the amount of the product of the COX-2 enzyme using e.g., thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, high performance iiquid chromatography and the like. Yet another way to measure the COX-2 activity would be to employ radio-labeling of substrates and monitoring the amount of radio-labeled end-product(s) of the COX-2 reaction. Regardless of the method employed one of skill in the art will be able to tabulate the end measurement as a cyciooxygenase activity e.g., O2 used/mg cyclooxygenase/min; mg product/mg cyclooxygenase/min; jiCi radio¬labeled product produced/mg cyclooxygenase/min; |iCi radio-labeled arachidonate used/mg cyclooxygenase/min.<br>
To identify a fruit extract as being capable of inhibiting COX-2, one would measure or determine the COX-2 activity of the microsomal preparation in the absence of the added candidate extract. One would then add the candidate extract to the preparation and re-determine the activity in the presence of the candidate extract. A candidate extract which reduces the amount of arachidonate oxygenated relative to the arachidonate oxygenation in its absence is indicative of a candidate extract with COX-2 inhibitory capability.<br>
Control experiments can be conducted in which known inhibitors of COX activity e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, Celebrex™, naproxen and the like may be used. By comparing the results of the fruit extract with that of the COX-2 activity in the presence of these known inhibitors useful, relative activities also may be determined.<br><br>
A significant decrease in arachidonate oxygenation, e.g., as measured using oxygen consumption with an 02 electrode, chromatography techniques (quantitation of end-product by densitometry or liquid scintillation spectroscopy), are represented by a reduction in COX-2 activity levels of at least about 20%-40%, and most preferably, by decreases of at least about 50%, with higher values, of course, being possible. Chromatography assays that measure arachidonic acid metabolites and COX enzyme assays that measure prostaglandin formation are well known in the art and may be conducted in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Quantitative In vitro testing of the inhibitory properties of the fruit extract is not a requirement of the invention as it is generally envisioned that the fruit extracts that form the nutraceutical agents of the present invention will often be the same compounds that are naturally found in the whole fruits. Of course, it should be understood that the anthocyanin and fiavonoid compounds that form the COX-2 inhibitory components of the fruit extracts described herein may further be modified in vivo upon ingestion to produce the anti-inflammatory compounds.<br>
Similarly, in vivo testing is not a necessary requirement. However, one of skill in the art may employ animal models of inflammation to test for the in vivo activity of these compounds. For example, a rodent model having an inflamed area may be used to test the anti-inflammatory effects of the COX-2 inhibitors that have been identified by assays such as those described above. Such an animal model would be employed in an assay which would use, for example, at least two animals having a similar inflammation, one of the animals would be contacted with the candidate anti-inflammatory composition and the other animal would be contacted with a control or placebo composition which contains all the components of the candidate composition with the notable exception that it lacks the anti-inflammatory component. A reduction in inflammation of the animal contacted with the candidate composition as compared to the animal contacted with the control or placebo composition would be indicative of the candidate composition having anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
E.       Combinations of Anthocyanins with Other Anti-Inflammatory Agents<br>
The present invention in certain aspects describes the beneficial intake of a food supplement having anti-inflammatory properties wherein the food supplement comprises a fruit extract having an anti-inflammatory activity greater than the anti¬inflammatory activity found in the natural fruit. Those of skill in the art shouid<br><br>
understand that such a food supplement may advantageously be combined with other anti-inflammatory agents. Such additional anti-inflammatory agents will, of course, be secondary to the fruit extracts of the present invention and may be any commonly recognized anti-inflammatory agent or indeed may be one that is identified by using the assay presented herein above.<br>
Regardless of whether the additional anti-inflammatory agent is a known anti¬inflammatory or is identified using the present invention, the present invention will contemplate the use of various combinations that may be employed. Thus, where the fruit extract is "A" and the other anti-inflammatory agent is "B" the combinations may be as follows:<br>
A/B/A B/A/B B/B/A A/A/B A/B/B B/A/A A/B/B/B B/A/B/B B/B/B/A B/B/A/B A/A/B/B A/B/A/B A/B/B/A B/B/A/A B/A/B/A       B/A/A/B       A/A/A/B      B/A/A/A      A/B/A/A      A/A/B/A<br>
The fruit extract and the additional anti-inflammatory agent may be contacted with or exposed to a cell either in vivo or in vitro to inhibit the COX-2 activity of the cell. The terms "contacted" and "exposed," when applied to a cell are used herein to describe the process by which a fruit extract and a second anti-inflammatory agent are delivered to a target cell or are placed in direct juxtaposition with the target cell. To achieve a beneficial effect, both agents may be delivered to a cell in a combined amount effective to inhibit COX-2 activity, decrease inflammation, and decrease the production of the inflammation causing prostaglandins or other such effect that will decrease the inflammatory response in a cell or an individual subject in which the cell is located.<br>
Anti-inflammatory agents are well known to those of skill in the art and include agents such as salicylic acid derivatives (e.g. aspirin) paraminophenol derivative (e.g. acetaminaphen) indole and indene acetic acids (indomethacin, sulindac and etodalac) heteroaryl acetic acids (tolmetin diclofenac and ketorolac, aryl propionic acid derivatives (ibuprofen, naproxen, keopren, fenopren, oxaprozine), anthranilic acids (mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid) enolic acids (piroxicam, tenoxicam, phenylbutazone and oxyphenthatrazone). These and other anti-inflammatory agents are well known to those of skill in the art and no additional description of these agents need be provided.<br><br>
F.        Formulations<br>
The present invention provides a natural food supplement made from fruit extracts wherein the food supplement comprises an anti-inflammatory activity that is greater than the antiinflammatory activity found in the natural fruit. The present invention provides a fruit extract that can be presented in a powdered, liquid, or solid forrrCSpecific formulations are provided herein below in the Examples, the present section discusses the forms and components of formulations that would be desirable and readily produced given the teachings of the present invention.<br>
The fruit extract is likely a reconstitutable powder composition that, when reconstituted with, for example, water, milk or some other similar liquid will provide a drink, which may be used to provide an anti-inflammatory activity to a subject in need thereof. The powdered composition and drink prepared therefrom are especially useful as an enterally administered component in a program of pain or inflammation management which utilizes a number of carefully designed products in various forms, i.e., in shake, soup, fruit drink, snack bar and other solid forms such as tablets, gel caps, and the like, which can be mixed and matched over a period of pain management to provide more attractive and, therefore, more effective support to a patient, particularly those in extended care situations.<br>
In addition to drinks, the fruit extracts of the present invention may be used in foodstuffs. Such fruit extracts may be combined with any other foodstuff, for example, oils containing the extracts of this invention may be used as cooking oil, frying oil, or salad oil and may be used in any oil-based food, such as margarine, mayonnaise or peanut butter. Grain fiour fortified with the compounds of this invention may be used in foodstuffs, such as baked goods, cereals, pastas and soups. Oils containing the fruit extracts and novel anthocyanins extracted therefrom can be emulsified and used in a variety of water-based foodstuffs, such as drinks, including drink mixes as discussed above. Advantageously, such foodstuffs may be included in low fat, low cholesterol or otherwise restricted dietary regimens.<br>
A "nutraceutical" is any functional food that provides an additional benefit other than its nutritional benefit. This category may include nutritional drinks, diet drinks (e.g., Slimfast™, Boost™ and the like) as well as sports herbal and other fortified beverages. The present invention provides nutraceutical compositions that may be used as an anti-inflammatory agent. As such, it can be used to relieve any<br><br>
condition that is mediated by the action of COX-2 including but not limited to, arthritis, headache, allergic rash, inflammatory bowel syndrome, joint pain, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and the like.<br>
In addition to the purified fruit extract, the nutraceutical or foodstuff also may contain a variety of other beneficial components including but not limited to essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. These components should be well known to those of skill in the art, however, without being bound to any particularly formulations or content the present section provides a brief discussion of components that could form part of the food supplements of the present invention. Additional disclosure describing the contents and production of nutritional supplements may be found in e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,902,797; U.S. Patent No. 5,834,048; U.S. Patent No. 5,817,350; U.S. Patent No. 5,792,461; U.S. Patent No. 5,707,657 and U.S. Patent No. 5,656,312 (each incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
Essential fatty acids such as y-linolenic acid (to-3) and linoleic acid (o&gt;-6) may be added to the food supplements ofthe present invention. Research has shown that in animals other than humans, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids is more important even than absolute amounts ofthe fatty acids. Boudreau MD, etal., "Lack of Dose Response by Dietary n-3 Fatty Acids at a Constant Ratio of n-3 to n-6 Fatty Acids in Suppressing Eicosanoid Biosynthesis from Arachidonic Acid," Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 54:111-117 (1991). Essential fatty acids are involved in cardiovascular health as well as in support of the immune system. An imbalance in these essential fatty acids can lead to poor cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, the immune system function can become impaired, leading to inflammation.<br>
Both calcium and magnesium are involved in bone health, among other functions. One possible effect of an imbalance between calcium and magnesium is an imbalance in bone minerals that can affect bone growth and bone turnover (the breaking down and building-up of bone). Magnesium is equally as important as calcium for bone health and reducing the risk of osteoporosis, which affects men as well as women( Purvis, J.R., "Effect of Oral Magnesium Supplementation Factors on Selected Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Non-lnsulin-Dependent Diabetics," Archives of Family Medicine 3:503-508 (1994).<br>
The minerals zinc and copper are both involved in cardiovascular health, and should be provided in a ratio of 5:1 zincxopper. An imbalance between these two<br><br>
minerals can cause an antagonistic effect of zinc on copper. This effect can interfere with the body's ability to use copper for supporting cardiovascular health. Too much zinc relative to copper can also interfere with the body's ability to manufacture SOD {superoxide dismutase), an important heart-protective enzyme. Also, a proper zincrcopper ratio is required to achieve a proper balance of HDL (high density lipoproteins) to LDL (low density lipoproteins). Zinc intake in the typical American man's diet is only 33 to 75 percent of RDA as such dietary supplements that include zinc are contemplated.<br>
Selenium and iodide also have a ratio at which they function most effectively, which is the ratio of selenium to iodide of about 2:1. These minerals affect thyroid function, and therefore also have the resulting effects on metabolism caused by changes in thyroid function. Imbalanced thyroid function can put undue stress on the body that will result in malabsorption of nutrients from food. This, in turn, can retard growth and development<br>
Pyridoxine, folate and cobalamin also have a ratio at which they function most effectively in the prevention of vascular disorders. The optimal ratio of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to folate to cobalamin (vitamin B 12) is about 100:4:1, respectively. These vitamins affect cardiovascular function through their abilities to reduce the levels of the potentially toxic amino acid homocysteine. This ratio recognizes the imbalanced and inadequate levels of these vitamins consumed by individuals at risk of heart disease from their diet.<br>
In addition, vitamin C, vitamin B1 (thiamin), and vitamin E also can be provided. Vitamin C requirements are increased in smokers and cigarette smoking is a major contributor to lung cancer. Vitamin B1 plays an essential role in energy transformation. Thiamin diphosphate (TDP) is a coenzyme necessary for the conversion of carbohydrates to energy. Since U.S. men currently consume about 45% of their total calories from carbohydrates, vitamin B1 optimization in the diet is desirable.<br>
Along with vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation help modulate blood levels of homocysteine and as such will be useful components in the dietary supplement formulations of the present invention. Vitamin D (calciferol) is essential for formation of the skeleton and for mineral homeostasis. Without vitamin D, the small intestine cannot absorb adequate calcium regardless of how much<br><br>
calcium is available for absorption. Thus, vitamin D is indicated as a component of a nutritional supplement to help build strong bones.<br>
The role of manganese in driving metalloenzyme manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) has been clearly identified, along with a similar role in other metalloenzyme systems (glutamine synthetase, arginase, and pyruvate carboxylase). Numerous enzyme systems have also been shown to undergo manganese activation, even though they are not manganese metalloenzymes. The manganese-SOD connection may be of special clinical importance, since this form of the metalloenzyme appears to be the sole operative form within the cell's mitochondrial membranes, and thus may play a unique role in protection of the mitochondria and assurance of the body's oxidative energy production system. The inclusion of manganese in a dietary supplement would be desirable.<br>
Additional micronutrients that may be included in the supplements include but are not limited to the vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, riboflavin, niacin, niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, cobalamin, biotin, inositol, choline Ditartrate, betaine, and vitamin K and minerals such as molybdenum, chromium and potassium.<br>
Stress, exercise, and other conditions create free radicals in the body, which can cause damage to the body's components. To counter the free radicals, the present invention may include the following antioxidants in addition to vitamins C and E discussed above: citrus bioflavonoids, mixed carotenoids, green tea extract, and N-acetylcysteine.<br>
In addition other flavorings and additives well known to those of skill in the art also may be added to the formulations to make them more palatable. For example, formulations may contain ginger, boswellia, fruit flavoring, coloring, preservatives and the like.<br>
When ingested in a solid form, the nutraceutical composition of the invention may additionally contain a solid carrier such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. When administered in liquid form, a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, oils of animal or plant origin such as peanut oil, mineral oil, soybean oil, or sesame oil, or synthetic oiis may be added. The nutraceutical composition of the present invention may also contain stabilizers, preservatives, buffers, antioxidants, or other additives known to those of skill in the art.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, a dietary or nutritional supplement or nutraceutical is provided and contains from 0.1% to 99%, preferably from 30% to 90% of an anthocyanin-containing fruit extract.   In this regard, a single dosage form (i.e., a single tablet, capsule, serving (whether liquid or solid)) contains from 1 mg. to 500 mg. of total anthocyanin, preferably from 5 mg. to 100 mg., more preferably from 20 mg. to 70 mg. of total anthocyanin. In a presently preferred formulation, a tablet (a single dosage form) is provided that contains 50 mg. of total anthocyanin. The phrase "total anthocyanin" refers to the total amount of anthocyanin present in the single dosage form.<br>
The extract obtained from an anthocyanin-containing plant is selected from the group consisting of peonidin, cyanidin, pelargonidin, delphinidin, petunnidin, malvidin, kaempferol, hesperidin, gentiodelphin, platyconin, cinerarin, including their glycoside derivatives, and mixtures thereof, in one a preferred embodiment, the anthocyanins are selected from the group consisting of cyanidin, peonidin, malvidin, petunidin, delphinidin, their glycoside derivatives, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Advantageously, the nutritional supplement contains the stable anthocyanin, which will be hydrolyzed in vivio to the aglycone form, anthocyanidin, to provide COX inhibition activity.<br>
A preferred nutritional supplement contains a fruit extract, wherein the fruit extract is selected from the group consisting of an extract of elderberry, tart cherry, bilberry, and mixtures thereof. More particularly, the fruit extract comprises an extract of elderberry in an amount from 2% to 98% by weight of the fruit extract, an extract of tart cherry in an amount from 1% to 49% by weight of the fruit extract, and an extract of bilberry in an amount from 1% to 49% by weight of the fruit extract.

in this preferred nutritional supplement, cyanidin comprises at least 90% by weight of the total anthocyanins present in the elderberry extract. Preferably, cyanidin comprises 95% and more preferably 96% by weight of the total anthocyanins present in the elderberry extract. In this regard, the<br><br>
cyanidin is present as a mixture of cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambunigrin, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, and cyanidin-3-samb-5-glucoside.<br>
Likewise, cyanidin comprises at least about 90% by weight of the total anthocyanins present in the tart cherry extract. Preferably, cyanidin comprises about 95% and more preferably about 96% by weight of the total anthocyanins present in the tart cherry extract. In contrast to the elderberry, the cyanidin is present as a mixture of cyanidin-3-rutinoside-haxose, cyanidin-3-rutinoside-pentose, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and peonidin-3-rutinoside.<br>
Finally, the bilberry contains a mixture of maividin, peonidin, cyanidin, petunidin, and delephinidin. Each of these anthocyanins comprise about 95% and more preferably about 96% by weight of the total anthocyanins present in the biiberry extract.

Thereafter, the permeate from the UF unit was subjected to reverse osmosis using a membranes having a 4,000 molecular weight cut off. The reverse osmosis step continues until the retentate contains about 1% or less by weight solids.<br>
The retentate is collected in a tank and concentrated to at least 20% by weight solids by a vacuum evaporator at a temperature of less than about 52° C. to avoid degradation of the concentrated flavonoids.<br>
The concentrate is combined with maltodextrin and spray dried with the outlet temperature of the spray drier maintained at a temperature less than about 27° C.<br>
The retained pulp from the bag press was collected, dried, and milled.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A batch consisting of 38.8 kilograms of tart cherries was pressed in a bag press to produce 19.3 kilograms of juice and 18.6 kilograms of cake. The juice, which had a pH of 3.3 was pumped to an ultrafiltration membrane at a flow rate between 1770 and 1950 g/min, a pressure of 10 bar, and a temperature ranging from initial 29° C. at the start of the filtration to 18° F. at the end of the filtration. A difiitrate flow was initiated and continued until the dissolved solids in the permeate were about 0.2% by weight.<br>
The ultrafiltration membrane was a PVDF polymeric membrane having a rated 100,000 molecular weight (Daltons) cut off. A suitable membrane can be obtained from PCI Membrane Systems under the tradename FP.<br>
At the end of the ultrafiltration, 53.7 kilograms of permeate containing 5% by weight solids and 3.49 kilograms of retentate containing 0.3% by weight solids was collected. The permeate was then subjected to nanofiltration/reverse osmosis at a feed pressure of 40 bar and a flow rate ranging initially from 1290 g/min to finally 1380 g/min at temperature of 24" C. at the start of the process and a temperature of 41D F. at the completion of the process. A difiitrate of 72.4 kilograms of water was used.<br>
A polyethersulphone membrane having a 4,000 molecular weight (Daltons) cut off was used. A suitable membrane can be obtained from PCI Membrane Systems under the tradename ES404.<br><br>
Upon completion of this step, 6.4 kilograms of retentate was collected and it contained 1% by weight solids. 117 kilograms of permeate containing 2% by weight solids was recovered.<br>
To produce a powder, the retentate was combined and mixed with 79 grams of maltodextrin M10Q and the resulting product was introduced into a spray drier with an inlet temperature of about 140° C. and an outlet temperature of about 90° C. to produce about 105 grams of powder.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Comparison of COX-2 and COX-1 inhibitory activity of fruit extracts.<br>
The present example describes an enzyme assay method using an oxygen monitoring system to monitor the COX inhibitory activity of fruit extracts. In this assay the changes of concentration of dissolved oxygen are constantly monitored by an oxygen electrode in a Dissolved Oxygen Measuring System (fnstech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The output is recorded by a linear Recorder (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).<br>
Each day a fresh potassium chloride solution (15g/100ml distilled water) was made and the electrode was set up according to manufacturers instructions. The chamber is kept at 37°C.<br>
A prostaglandin assay kit was used and the assay set up in a manner similar to that described for the COX-1 assay. Briefly, 50^1 phenol was added to 20ml 100mM Tris buffer, warmed to 37°C for 1 minute (working buffer). To a tube of hematin 0.9ml of the working buffer was added. 50^1 0.1 NaOH was added to an arachidonic acid vial and vortexed. 0.43m! water was added and the solution mixed again. Samples of extracts were weighed and dissolved in the working buffer to a final concentration of 0.1 g/ml. Buffer, samples or diluted samples are used in the enzyme assays directly.<br>
The enzyme assay is performed according to the manufacturer's instruction, which should be well known to those of skill in the art. Briefly, 600^.1 of working buffer were drawn into the chamber from the overflow outlet with the injection valve close, and the main outlet connected to a syringe in the right orientation. The stir bar was set a speed of 3k/min. At 1 minute intervals, 5u! enzyme, 15ul hematin solution, 6ul buffer or sample or diluted sample and 8ul arachidonic acid solution was injected.<br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A presently preferred method of determining whether an inhibitor candidate inhibits either COX-1 or COX-2 is described below, in general, for each inhibitor candidate, six different concentrations are used for both COX 1 and COX 2 enzyme reactions. The content of PG-f2a from standards, or enzyme reactions are quantitated by an immunoassay. The amount of PG-f2a in standards is used to make a standard curve (optical density vs. concentration) and the standard curve is used to calculate the amount of PG-f2a in each enzyme reaction (regression) for the samples. Then, the content of PG-f2a from the six different reaction concentrations of the same inhibitor candidate is used to make a sampie curve. Finally, the concentration of the inhibitor candidate that inhibits the enzyme to 50% of its maximal activity (with no inhibitors), or l50 is obtained from the sample curve. To keep the results consistent, one inhibitor candidate or drug is used for each set of experiments as a positive control.<br>
COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were obtained from Dr. Daniel Tai at the University of Kentucky. They were prepared as follows: COX-1 enzyme was extracted from human platelet concentrate obtained from the Central Kentucky Blood Center. The platelet suspension was centrifuged at 1,000xg for 10 min. The pellet was washed with the same volume of phosphate-buffer saline and the suspension was again centrifuged. The platelets were suspended in 5 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.5, and subjected to sonication for 3x20 sec at 4°C. The suspension<br><br>
was centrifuged at 5,000xg for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000xg for 60 min. The pellet (microsomes) was suspended in 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.5 and stored in 200 nl aliquots at -80DC. This fraction was used as a source of COX-1 enzyme.<br>
Recombinant human COX-2 enzyme was obtained from insect cells (Sf9) infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying ,COX-2 cDNA. Briefly, Sf9 ceils (1x107)were seeded in 75 cm2 tissue culture flask in 20 ml of complete TNF-FH medium. Cells were allowed to attach for 1 hour. The medium was removed; 4 ml of Grace's medium containing recombinant virus at a multiplicity of about 10 was added. The cells were allowed to grow continuously for 72 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500xg for 10 min. The cells were then suspended in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5 buffer and sonicated for 3x10 sec at 0°C. The homogenate was briefly spun at 5,000xg for 5 sec to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then stored in 200 \d aliquots at -80°C. This fraction was used as a source of COX-2 enzyme.<br>
The following buffers were prepared:<br>
1.	Coating Buffer:        0.1M NaHC03/Na2C03.      pH9.5<br>
2.	enzyme immunoassay ("EIA") Buffer:      0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH7.5 containing 0.9% NaCI and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (ELISA or RIA grade)<br>
3.	Antibody Stabilizing Buffer: EIA buffer plus sucrose (5 g per 100 ml)<br>
4.	Washing Buffer:       0.01M KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH7.5 containing 0.05% Tween 20<br>
5.	Enzyme reaction buffer and sample dilution buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5<br>
6.	PBS (phosphate buffer saline) 10 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH7.5 containing 0.9% NaCI<br>
7.	Protein A solution    1 mg/ml in PBS<br>
The wells for the immunoassay were coated by (a) adding 100 jil protein A solution to 19.9 ml coating buffer, mixing well, and pouring into a dispensing tray; (b) pipetting 200 \x\ of the above to each well (rinse many times before delivering to wells); (c) storing the plates at room temperature for 4-5 h or 37°C for 2-3 h or 4°C<br><br><br><br><br>
Where the inhibitor candidates were extracts of anthocyanin-containing plants, the anthocyanins were extracted, concentrated, and hydrolyzed to provide the aglycone form, e.g., the anthocyanidin. Similarly, where the inhibitor candidates were commercial extracts, the extracts were hydroiyzed to provide the aglycone form. In each case, it was the aglycone form of the anthocyanins that were tested. The hydrolyzed anthocyanins were then dissolved in 0.1 % HCI in methanol for testing.<br>
PGF-2a is a prostaglandin and an enzyme reaction is conducted to determine whether the inhibitor candidate effectively inhibits either COX-1 or COX-2 (depending on the enzyme being used). PGF-2cc is the indirect stable prostaglandin reduced from the prostaglandin products formed by the enzyme reaction.<br>
The enzyme reaction procedure was conducted as follows: (a) 335 pi of a buffer (50 wM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was prepared and mixed at room temperature with 50jil of isoproterenol, 10jj.f of hemoglobin, 5ul of SnCI2, and 5ul of enzyme (depending on the enzyme to be tested, e.g. COX-1 or COX-2 described above); (b) 455 n! of the mixture (a) was added to tubes that contained 40 ul of the inhibitor candidate, mix; (c) add 5 ul of the arachidonic acid solution to each tube, mix, and incubate at 37° C for 5 min.; (d) stop the reaction by adding 30 \i\ of the 1N HCI and mixing; (e) neutralize by adding 30 p.l of 1 M Tris-base.<br>
The enzyme immunoassay procedure is a method to measure the amount of PGF-2a generated by the enzyme reaction. The enzyme immunoassay was conducted in the following manner; (a) shake out all the liquid in the well and blot on the paper towel; (b) wash w/ 200 ul washing buffer 2 times, shake and blot; (c) add 50 |xl of the PGF-2a-antibody; (d) add 50 ul STD (PGF-2a) orthe enzyme reaction<br><br>
product from above (diluted 50 X with EiA buffer); (e) add 100 pit PGF-2a-HRP (in ElA buffer); (f) shake and allow the plate to stay at room temperature for 1 hour; (g) wash wells three times by repeating step (b); (h) add 100jxl substrate buffer to each weli; (i) incubate at room temperature for 3 to 30 minutes depending on the color development; (j) turn on the computer and 96-well bioassay reader, and follow the operation instructions (Molecular Devices, V^ax kinetic microplate reader); (k) add 30 \i\ 1 N HCI to terminate the reaction; (I) read at 420 nm.; (m) save the data.<br>
The data is analyzed by: (a) copying the data to a spreadsheet, (b) making a standard curve according to the standard PGF-2a immunoassay results; (c) finding the PGF~2cc amount in all sample enzyme reactions using regression from the standard curve; (d) drawing a curve for each sample; and (e) determining Iso-In accordance with this procedure, several inhibitor candidates were evaluated and the results in set forth in Table 3, below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
