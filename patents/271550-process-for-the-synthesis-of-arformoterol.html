APPLICANT<br>
CIPLA LIMITED<br>
AN INDIAN COMPANY<br>
OF 289 BELLASIS ROAD, MUMBAI CENTRAL, MUMBAI - 400 008,<br>
MAHARASHTRA<br>
INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ARFORMOTEROL<br>
5  Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of intermediates useful in the synthesis of formoterol or enantiomers and acid addition salts thereof.<br>
10  Background of the Invention<br>
Formoterol is a long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist and has a long duration of action of up to 12 hours.  Chemvcally it is termed as N-[2-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[(2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-yl]amino]ethyl]phenyl}-formamide. The structure of formoterol 15  is as shown below.<br><br>
The asterisks indicate that formoterol has two chiral centers in the molecule, each of .20  which can exist in two possible configurations. This gives rise to four diastereomers which have the following configurations: (R,R), <s and></s>
(R,R) and (S,S) are mirror images of each other and are therefore enantiomers. Similarly (S,R) and (R,S) form other enatiomeric pair. 25<br>
The commercially-available formoterol is a 50:50 mixture of the (R,R)- and (S,S)-<br>
enantiomers.   (R,R)-formoterol   is   an   extremely   potent   full   agonist   at   the  β2-<br>
.  adrenoceptor  and   is   responsible   for   bronchodilation   and   has   anti-inflammatory<br><br>
2 properties. On the other hand (S,S)-enantiomer, has no bronchodilatory activity and is proinflammatory,<br>
Murase et al. [Chem.Pharm.Bull., 26(4)1123-1129(1978)] synthesized all four isomers 5  of formoterol and examined for β-stimulant activity. In the process, racemic formoterol was subjected to optical resolution with tartaric acid.<br>
In another attempt by Trofast et al. [Chirality, 3:443-450(1991)], racemic 4-benzyloxy-3-nitrostryrene oxide was coupled with optically pure N-[(R)-1-phenylethyr]-2-(4-10 methoxypheny))-(R)1-methylethylamine to give diastereomeric mixtures of intermediates, which were separated by column chromatography and converted to the opticallypure formoterol.<br>
In yet another attempt, racemic formoterol was subjected to separation by using a chiral 15  compound [International publication W01995/018094].<br>
WO 98/21175 discloses a process for preparing optically pure formoterol using optically pure intermediates (R)-N-benzyl-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl amine and (R)-4_ benzyloxy-3-formamidostyrene oxide. .20<br>
Preparation of optically pure formoterol is also disclosed in (E 000138 and GB .2380996.<br>
Increasing use and therapeutic benefit and use through newer drug delivery, Metered 25  Dose Inhaler (MDI) necessitates further research to develop new improved processes for the synthesis of formoterol which are suitable for Industrial scale up with improved impurity profile.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
30<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing intermediates useful in the synthesis of formoterol, its enantiomers and acid addition salts thereof, which process is simple, economical and suitable for industrial scale up.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the synthesis of formoterol, its enantiomers and acid addition salts thereof.<br>
5  Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing the (R,R)-diastereromer of a compound of formula (VI) or a salt thereof 10<br><br>
the process comprising: (i) reacting 4-methoxyphenyl acetone with an amine of formula (VIII) under conditions of reductive amination to produce the (R)-enantiomer of a 15  compound of formula (II) or a salt thereof, wherein there is no isolation of an imine intermediate formed during the reductive amination,<br><br>
20 (ii) condensing the (R)-enantiomer of compound (H) or the acid addition salt thereof with an α -haloketone of formula (III) to produce the (R)-enantiomer of a compound of formula (IV)<br><br><br>
(Hi) reducing the (R)-enantiomer of compound (IV) to the (R,R)-diastereomer of a compound of formula (V)<br><br>
and (iv) reducing the (R,R)-diastereomer of compound (V) to the (R,R)-diastereomer of the compound of formula (VI), wherein the reduction is carried out in the presence of 10 either (1) a hydrogen donating compound in the presence of a hydrogen transfer catalyst; or (2) ammonium formate using a hydrogenation catalyst, wherein: R1 and R2 are independently optionally substituted arylalkyl, and Hal is selected from chloro or bromo.<br>
15 Each of steps (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) forms an individual aspect of the present invention as is detailed below. The embodiments of the invention, as detailed below, also apply to the preferred process described above.<br><br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer of a compound of formula (il) or an acid addition salt thereof,<br><br>
the process comprising reductive amination of 4-methoxyphenyl acetone with an amine of formula (VIII)<br>
R1NH2<br>
wherein R1 is optionally substituted arylalkyl to obtain compound (II) or an acid addition salt thereof.<br>
15 The reductive amination proceeds via an intermediate imine. In the prior art processes (for example W099/67198), the imine is isolated and then hydrogenated. Advantageously, in the process of the present invention, the imine is not isolated, i.e. it is produced in situ.<br>
.20 R1 and R2 function as protecting groups. If R1 and/or R2 are substituted arylalkyl, they may comprise one or more substituents, none of which interferes with the function of the R1 and/or R2 groups as protecting groups. The substituent(s) may be on the aryl component and/or on the alkyl component. In an embodiment, the substituent is on the alkyl component and is C1_3 alkyl, preferably methyl.<br>
25<br>
R1 and R2 are independently an optionally substituted arylalkyl, which means that the alkyl group is covalently bonded to the aryl group and to the nitrogen of the amine<br><br>
moiety (in the case of R1 and to the oxygen of the hydroxyl moiety (in the case of R2). Preferably, the aryl component is a C6-10 aryl. Preferably, the alkyl component is a C1-6 alkyl, more preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
5 In an embodiment, R1 is arylalkyl. The arylalkyl group may be substituted. In an embodiment, the arylalkyl group is C6-10 aryl-(c1-6 )alkyl. In an embodiment, aryl is phenyl. In another embodiment, alkyl is C1 to C6 alkyl, preferably C1 to C3 alkyl, more preferably methyl or ethyl. Preferably, arylalkyl is benzyl or substituted benzyl (wherein the methyl component is substituted) such as 1-phenylethyl. Most preferably, arylalkyl 10 is benzyl. Preferably, R2 is benzyl. Suitably, both R1 and R2 are benzyl.<br>
Preferably, Hal is bromo.<br>
Compound (II) as shown above is depicted in the form of the (R)-enantiomer. In some<br>
15 embodiments,   compound  (II)  is  produced   in  racemic form,   hereinafter termed<br>
compound (IIA), and the process further comprises resolving the racemic compound<br>
(IIA) with a resolving agent,    in particular, when compound (VIII) is benzylamine,<br>
compound (II) is produced in racemic form and the process further comprises resolving<br>
the racemic compound (HA). Suitably, the resolving agent is a chiral acid, such as ┴ or<br>
20  D mandelic acid or L or D- tartaric acid and the resolution produces compound (II) in the<br>
form of an acid addition salt.  Optionally, the acid addition salt is converted to the free<br>
base, i.e. optically pure compound (II) after resolution. The choice of the L- or D-isomer<br>
of the chira! acid will depend on the desired enantiomer of compound (II).  The skilled<br>
person would be well able to make such a choice.  Preferably, compound (II) is in the<br>
25 form of the (R)-enantiomer and the resolving agent is L-mandelic acid. The resolution<br>
may be earned out in an alcohol solvent, such as methanol. Typically, the chiral acid<br>
salt of compound (II) is crystallized two or three times after resolution.<br>
In other embodiments, compound (II) is produced directly from the reductive amination 30  in optically pure form, and  no further resolution is required.    In particular, when compound (VIII) is (R)-1-phenyfethylamine, there is no need for resolution.<br><br>
Two preferred embodiments of the reductive amination are depicted in the scheme below.<br><br>
In an embodiment, the reductive amination is carried out at standard atmospheric pressure, i.e. pressure ranging from about 90 kPa to about 110 kPa, typically at a pressure of around 101 kPa.<br>
10   In an embodiment, the reductive amination is carried out using an ionic compound in an organic solvent or an aqueous solvent or a mixture thereof.<br>
The "ionic compound" is typically an inert substance.    The purpose of the ionic<br>
compound is to minimize changes in the pH of a solution thereby controlling the<br>
15  impurity formation during the reaction and enhancing the rate of reaction. These ionic<br>
compounds not only have the potential to increase chemical reactivity and thus lead to<br><br>
more efficient process, but also are non-flammable and are less toxic than conventional solvents due to their low vapor pressure.<br>
In an embodiment, the ionic compound is selected from the group consisting of 5 ammonium acetate, ammonium chloride-ammonium hydroxide, ammonium citrate, ammonium tartrate, calcium phosphate, citrate, phosphate, potassium phosphate, potassium acetate, potassium chloride, potassium citrate, sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium chloride, triethylammonium formate, pyridinium formate, sodium perchlorate and triethylammonium formate.

.20<br>
In an embodiment, the reductive amination is carried out at a temperature below 10°C, suitably below 5°C.<br>
Typially, the reductive amination is carried out in the presence of a reducing agent. The 25  reducing agent may be selected from sodium borohydride, sodium cyano borohydride, sodium      triacetoxyborohydride,       potassium      borohydride      and      potassium cyanoborohydride.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, compound (tl) may be prepared by reductive amination 30 of 4-methoxy phenyl acetone with amine of formula (VI11); in the presence of a hydrogenating catalyst under hydrogen pressure in a solvent or mixture of solvents.

fn an embodiment, R1 is benzyl or 1-phenylethyl and the compound of formula (VIII) is designated (Villa) or (Vlllb) respectively<br><br>
It has surprisingly been found that the use of the benzylated compound of formula (Villa) or (Vlllb) minimizes the formation of the dimeric impurity and regioisomer. The compound (Vlllb) may be in the form of the (R)- or the (S)-enantiomer. Preferably, compound (Vlllb) is in the form of the (R) enantiomer.<br>
