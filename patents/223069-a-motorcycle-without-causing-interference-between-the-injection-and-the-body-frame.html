				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MOTORCYCLE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle mounted with<br>
an engine including an intake unit whose intake path has a fuel<br>
injection valve placed at some point thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
A conventional under-bone type motorcycle, for example,<br>
a motorcycle 50 shown in FIG.l, comprises a front tire 51 and<br>
a front fender 52 for covering the front tire 51 in the lower<br>
part, a body frame having a backbone 54 inclined toward the<br>
rear part of the body from a head pipe 53 which rotatably holds<br>
a steering handle in the upper part and an engine 55 below the<br>
backbone 54.<br>
To be cooled with wind while the vehicle is moving, the<br>
engine 55 is fixed below the backbone 54 by means of a crankcase<br>
55c with a cylinder head 55a attached to a body cylinder 55b<br>
disposed on the front side of the body. An air cleaner 56<br>
attached to the backbone 54 on the front side of the body and<br>
a carburetor 57 is connected between this air cleaner 56 and<br>
engine 55 via an intake pipe (intake manifold) 58 as a fuel<br>
supply unit.<br>
Thus, according to the structure of the conventional<br>
under-bone type motorcycle 50 provided with the carburetor 57,<br>
the carburetor 57 which should be placed horizontally for<br>
functional reasons is provided between the air cleaner 56 above<br>
and the cylinder head 55a below in a narrow space surrounded<br>
by the front fender 52, backbone 54 and cylinder head 53a of<br>
the engine 55. For this reason, an intake pipe 58a connecting<br>
the air cleaner 56 and carburetor 57 and an intake pipe 58b<br>
connecting the carburetor 57 and cylinder head 55a should be<br>
bent at an acute angle, which increases air resistance in the<br>
respective parts of the intake pipe 58 and prevents the output<br>
from improving.<br>
As a structure for solving this problem, a structure using<br>
an engine provided with a fuel injection type intake unit instead<br>
of the carburetor 57 is available.<br>
The related art engines provided with a fuel injection<br>
type intake unit include an engine (for example, see Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No.HEI09-014102) provided with a<br>
fuel injection valve (hereinafter referred to as injector) on<br>
the downstream side of throttle valves in an intake path<br>
communicating with an intake valve opening.<br>
The engine with the above described conventional intake<br>
unit arranges the injector in an intake manifold which is a<br>
part of the intake path and which is away from the intake valve<br>
opening toward the upstream. For this reason, when the engine<br>
is mounted on the body frame of the motorcycle, the location<br>
of the intake manifold itself is limited for structural reasons<br>
of the motorcycle and the problem is that it is difficult to<br>
secure a space for installing the injector.<br>
FIG.2 shows an example of a motorcycle with an engine<br>
including a fuel injection intake unit. In FIG.2, the same<br>
components as those in FIG.l are assigned the same names and<br>
the same reference numerals and explanations thereof will be<br>
omitted.<br>
A motorcycle 60 shown in FIG.2 has the same body frame<br>
as the under-bone type motorcycle 50 shown in FIG. 1 and an engine<br>
61 is placedbelow the backbone 54 . A throttle body 58 is placed<br>
between a cylinder head 61a of the engine 61 and an air cleaner<br>
56.<br>
As shown in this figure, in order for the engine 61 including<br>
the fuel injection intake unit to correctly supply atomized<br>
air of an injector (fuel intake valve) 59 to the interior of<br>
the cylinder block 61b, it is necessary to bend the portion<br>
of an intake pipe 57c connected to an intake port 61d and mount<br>
the injector 59 in this bent portion.<br>
That is, for example, with the body frame of an under-bone<br>
type, fixing the engine in suspension below a main pipe extending<br>
downward from a head pipe towards the rear will easily cause<br>
interference between the injector and the main pipe. Thus,<br>
it is necessary to lower the placement position of the engine,<br>
or slant or displace the placement position of the injector<br>
towards right or left. As such, the placement flexibility of<br>
the engine to the body is resultantly reduced. Moreover,<br>
attempting to place the injector in a position where it does<br>
not interfere with the main pipe (backbone) results in a smaller<br>
radius of curvature as shown in FIG.2, which increases air<br>
resistance and prevents improvement of the output.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
motorcycle capable of avoiding interference between the<br>
injector and the body frame and retaining the placement<br>
flexibility of the engine to the body, provide excellent intake<br>
efficiency and improve the output.<br>
This object can be achieved by a motorcycle comprising<br>
a downward curved main frame, an engine and an air cleaner<br>
arranged below the main frame, and an intake pipe provided below<br>
the main frame and between the engine and air cleaner, wherein<br>
the engine comprises an intake valve mounting section in which<br>
an intake valve for taking air into a cylinder is mounted, an<br>
exhaust valve mounting section in which an exhaust valve for<br>
exhausting a gas from the cylinder is mounted, an intake port<br>
connected to the intake pipe for supplying outer air to the<br>
intake valve, an inj ector mounting section in which an inj ector<br>
for ejecting a fuel is mounted and a fuel injection opening<br>
is disposed in a position between a stem of the intake valve<br>
and a center axis of the intake port and close to an end of<br>
the intake port on the intake valve side, and a cylinder head<br>
with which the intake valve mounting section, the exhaust valve<br>
mounting section, the intake port and the injector mounting<br>
section are formed integral and the intake pipe and the injector<br>
are arranged in such a way as to be prevented from interfering<br>
with each other.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings, embodiments<br>
of the present invention will be explained in detail below.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
This embodiment of the present invention will be explained<br>
based on the attached drawings below..<br>
FIG.3 to FIG.7 illustrate a motorcycle according to the<br>
first embodiment, FIG.3 being a right side view showing how<br>
an engine is mounted, FIG. 4 being a schematic configuration<br>
diagram showing how the engine is mounted in the motorcycle<br>
shown in FIG. 3, FIG. 5 being a plan view showing how the engine<br>
is mounted and FIG. 6, FIG. 7 being a cross-sectional right side<br>
view and cross-sectional front view of a cylinder head part<br>
of the engine. Herein, in the present embodiment, expressions<br>
of front, rear, left, and right are those viewed from a driver<br>
seating on a seat of the motorcycle.<br>
In FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, reference numeral 20 denotes a. body<br>
frame of an under-bone type of the motorcycle . This body frame<br>
20 is provided with a headpipe 20a, the end part of which supports<br>
a front fork that axially supports a front wheel such that the<br>
front wheel can be directed to left and right freely, a main<br>
pipe (main frame) 20b which extends from the head pipe 20a<br>
downward under the seat towards the back obliquely, and a rear<br>
arm bracket 20c which is fixed to the rear end part of the main<br>
pipe 20b and extends downward. To the rear arm bracket 20c,<br>
a rear arm 20f axially supporting a rear wheel by its rear end<br>
part is pivotally supported to vertically swingable.<br>
Note that reference numeral 24 denotes a fuel tank provided<br>
above the rear end part of the main pipe 20b, and a seat (not<br>
shown) is mounted on the fuel tank 24. As shown in FIG. 4, a<br>
front tire 31 and a front fender 32 for covering the front tire<br>
31 are provided at the lower end of the main pipe 20a.<br>
Below the rear part of the main pipe 20b and in the front<br>
of the rear arm bracket 20c, an engine 1 is fixed in suspension,<br>
a cylinder axis of which is directed substantially horizontal<br>
towards the front, and a crankshaft directed in the body-width<br>
direction.<br>
More specifically, in the engine 1, a bcss section 21a<br>
formed to the front end part of the upper wall of a crankcase<br>
21 is fixed using a bolt to a bracket 23 fixed to the right-side<br>
and left-side of the main pipe 20b via a bracket 22 . Moreover,<br>
a boss section 21b formed to the rear part of the bottom wall<br>
of the crankcase 21 is fixed using a bolt to a boss section<br>
20d formed to the lower front end part of the rear arm bracket<br>
20c.<br>
The engine 1 is of an air-cooled four-cycle single cylinder<br>
type, and to the front wall of the crankcase 21 including a<br>
crankshaft and a transmission mechanism, a cylinder block 2<br>
and a cylinder head 3 are stacked to be tightened together<br>
securely. A front plane 3a of the cylinder head 3 is provided<br>
with a head cover 4.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, into a cylinder bore 2b of the cylinder<br>
block 2, a piston (not shown) is inserted to freely slide. The<br>
piston is coupled to the crankshaft by a connecting rod.<br>
To a rear plane 3b of the cylinder head 3, a combustion<br>
recess 3c structuring the combustion chamber with the piston<br>
in the cylinder bore 2b is formed. In the combustion recess<br>
3c, an exhaust valve opening 3d and an intake valve opening<br>
3e are formed, two of each. The exhaust valve openings 3d are<br>
connected to an exhaust port 3f formed in the cylinder head<br>
3 and an exhaust gas from the exhaust port 3d is directed to<br>
the lower wall of the cylinder head 3 by the exhaust port 3f.<br>
Furthermore, the intake valve openings 3e are connected to an<br>
intake port 3g formed in the cylinder head 3 and intake air<br>
to the intake valve openings 3e is guided to the upper wall<br>
of the cylinder head 3 by the intake port 3g.<br>
The exhaust valve openings 3d are each opened/closed by<br>
a valve head 6a of an exhaust valve 6 which moves forward and<br>
backward in a direction perpendicular to the opening plane of<br>
the exhaust valve opening 3d.<br>
The exhaust valve 6 is disposed in the cylinder head 3<br>
and a valve shaft 6b of the exhaust valve 6 is placed in such<br>
a way as to slant towards below the engine, forming an angle<br>
of 91 with a cylinder axis A. A retainer 6c is disposed at<br>
a base end of the valve shaft 6b and a valve spring 6d is interposed<br>
between this retainer 6c and a spring seat 3k formed in the<br>
cylinder head 3.<br>
The exhaust valve 6 is biased by this valve spring 6d in<br>
the direction in which the valve shaft 6b goes away from the<br>
exhaust valve opening 3d, that is, in the direction in which<br>
the valve head 6a closes the exhaust valve opening 3d.<br>
Furthermore, the intake valve openings 3e are each<br>
opened/closed by a valve head 7a of an intake valve 7, which<br>
moves forward and backward in a direction perpendicular to the<br>
opening plane of the intake valve opening 3e. The intake valve<br>
7 is disposed in the cylinder head 3 and a valve shaft 7b of<br>
this intake valve 7 is placed so as to slant towards above the<br>
engine, forming an angle of 92 with the cylinder axis line A.<br>
Furthermore, a retainer 7c is disposed at a base end of the<br>
valve shaft 7b and a valve spring 7d is interposed between this<br>
retainer 7c and a spring seat 3k formed in the cylinder head<br>
3. The intake valve 7 is biased by this valve spring 7d in<br>
the direction in which the valve shaft 7b goes away from the<br>
exhaust valve opening 3e, that is, in the direction in which<br>
the valve head 7a closes the exhaust valve opening 3e.<br>
A cam shaft 8 for both intake and exhaust is placed, to<br>
freely rotate, so as to be between the valve spring 7d of the<br>
intake valve 7 and the valve spring 6d of the exhaust valve<br>
6 of the cylinder head 3.<br>
In the front between the cam shaft 8 and the exhaust valve<br>
6, an exhaust rocker arm 9 is placed, which is rotatably supported<br>
by an exhaust rocker shaft 9a. Furthermore, in the front<br>
between the cam shaft 8 and the intake valve 7, an intake rocker<br>
arm 10 is placed, which is rotatably supported by an intake<br>
rocker shaft 10a. These rocker arms 9, 10 contact a cam of<br>
the cam shaft 8 at one end, push the upper ends of the valve<br>
stem 6b, 7b at the other end as the cam shaft 8 rotates and<br>
move the valve stem 6b, 7b in opposite directions to the bias<br>
direction, respectively. The intake rocker axes 9a, 10a are<br>
supported on boss sections protruding from the inner surface<br>
of the head cover 4.<br>
Here, with respect to the cylinder axis line A, the cam<br>
shaft 8 is offset by a towards the exhaust side. Thereby, the<br>
angle 92 formed with the cylinder axis line A of the intake<br>
valve 7 is set so as to be smaller than the angle 01 formed<br>
with the cylinder axis line A of the exhaust valve 6. That<br>
is, the intake valve 7 is placed upright closer to the cylinder<br>
axis line A than the exhaust valve 6. As a result, a large<br>
space covering from the intake valve 7 to the upper part of<br>
the engine is saved and using this space allows the injector,<br>
which will be described later, to be installed freely.<br>
The intake port 3g is bent in the direction substantially<br>
orthogonal to the cylinder axis line A from the intake valve<br>
opening 3e and then extends upwards, partially structuring the<br>
intake path for guiding the outside air into the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
A bent portion at a downstream end of the intake port 3g<br>
is divided by a partition wall 3h into branch paths 3i, 3i<br>
communicating with the left and right intake valve openings<br>
3e, 3e. To an outer connection port 3j locating at an upstream<br>
end of the intake port 3g, a throttle body 5 is connected as<br>
a part of the intake path.<br>
The throttle body 5 includes, from downstream to upstream,<br>
first and second throttle valves 5a and 5b in this order and<br>
is disposed in a position close to the intake port 3g.<br>
To a drive pulley 5c fixed to the valve shaf- of the second<br>
throttle valve 5b, an end of a throttle operation cable 29 is<br>
coupled, and the other end of the cable 29 is coupled to a throttle<br>
grip of a steering handle.<br>
The drive pulley 5c of the second throttle valve 5b and<br>
the first throttle valve 5a are coupled to each other via a<br>
delay mechanism 5d of a link type.<br>
The opening degrees of the first and second throttle valves<br>
5a and 5b are controlled as below in accordance with the change<br>
of a load (throttle operation amount) . The first throttle valve<br>
5a placed in the downstream is retained at a fully-closed<br>
position in the range from the no-load (idling) operation period<br>
to the predetermined part-load operation period. Thereby,<br>
atomized air for accelerating atomization of the ejected fuel<br>
is supplied a lot to the vicinity of a injection nozzle 11a<br>
of the injector 11. Thus, by supplying a large amount of<br>
atomized air to the vicinity of the injection nozzle lla of<br>
the injector 11, the throttle body 5 accelerates gasification<br>
of the jet fuel in a low-load operation.<br>
The second throttle valve 5b located in the upstream is<br>
the throttle valve of a normal type used for controlling the<br>
area of the main-passage depending on the throttle operation.<br>
On the front wall side of the intake port 3g in FIG.3,<br>
the injector 11 is placed so as to slant towards above the engine,<br>
corresponding to a center axis B of the intake port 3g with<br>
a front view, and forming an angle of (2 + 3) with respect<br>
to the cylinder axis line A when viewed from the cam shaft.<br>
The position placement and angle setting, etc., of the<br>
injector 11 are made as follows. That is, the air/gas mixture<br>
of the fuel and the atomized air mainly goes through the side<br>
 of the cylinder axis line A of a annular gap formed between<br>
the intake valve opening 3e and the valve head 7a of the intake<br>
valve 7 at the opening position along the inner part of the<br>
exhaust valve opening in the cylinder bore 2b, and is ejected<br>
towards the cylinder axis line A. That is, the injector 11<br>
is disposed in the cylinder head 3 at such an angle that the<br>
fuel injection opening is arranged opposed to the intake valve<br>
opening 3e and the mixture of the fuel ejected from the fuel<br>
injection opening and air generates air motion such as tumble<br>
in the cylinder.<br>
That is, as shown in FIG.2, the injector 11 is disposed<br>
in a position that the diameter of an effective spot of the<br>
mixture of the fuel ejected from the fuel injection opening<br>
of the injection nozzle 11a and air at the intake valve opening<br>
3e is smaller than the radius of the intake valve opening and<br>
the axis of this effective spot passes through the intake valve<br>
opening 3e and crosses the inner wall of the cylinder.<br>
In other words, the injector 11 is disposed so that the<br>
injection nozzle lla, as seen from the horizontal direction<br>
in FIG.l, is located within an area connecting the base end<br>
of the valve shaft 7b when the intake valve openings 3e are<br>
closed with the valve heads 7a, an intersection between the<br>
axes of the intake valves 7 and the center axis B of the intake<br>
port 3g and an intersection between the center axis B of the<br>
intake port 3g and the external connection port 3 j at the upstream<br>
end of the cylinder head 3.<br>
Note that this injector 11 is preferably disposed in such<br>
a way that the distance from the opening planes of the intake<br>
valve openings 3e to the injection nozzle lla is no greater<br>
than 4.0 cm.<br>
Furthermore, the injector 11 directly ejects the fuel from<br>
the intake valve 3e opened during fuel ejection into the cylinder<br>
bore 2b.Engine Control Unit For example, the ejection timing<br>
of the injector 11 with respect to the intake valve openings<br>
3e is controlled by a control unit such as an ECU (Engine Control<br>
Unit) .<br>
The front wall of the intake port 3g is provided with an<br>
attachment hole 3m extending therethrough so that the exterior<br>
thereof communicates from the outside v/ith the interior of the<br>
intake port 3g.<br>
The part of the attachment hole 3m near the intake port<br>
communicating portion thereof forms an injection path 14 for<br>
guiding the inj ected fuel from the intake port 3g to the interior<br>
of the cylinder bore 2b through the intake valve opening, and<br>
a cylindrical holder 12 is fitted firmly in the inj ection passage<br>
14 . In a support hole 12a placed outside of the axial direction<br>
of the holder 12, the injection nozzle lla of the injector 11<br>
is inserted and engaged.<br>
In this way, the injection nozzle lla is disposed in a<br>
position between the stem of the intake valve 7 and center axis<br>
B of the intake port 3g and close to the end of the intake port<br>
3g on the intake valve side.<br>
Herein, the fuel injection hole of the injection nozzle<br>
lla is in a shape of ejecting the fuel as branch currents towards<br>
the right and left intake valve openings 3e, 3e.<br>
Further, the inner part of the holder 12 in the axial<br>
direction is a jet opening 12b.The fuel ejected from the<br>
injection nozzle 11a of the injector 11 so as to branch into<br>
two flows is mixed with the atomized air in the jet opening<br>
12b and supplied to the combustion chamber (cylinder bcre 2b)<br>
by going through the branch paths 3i, 3i of the intake port<br>
3g from the jet opening 12b.<br>
Here, the jet opening 12b of the holder 12 is opposed to<br>
the partition wall 3h, which is provided with a recessed portion<br>
3n notched for avoiding collision with the fuel ejected from<br>
the injector 11.<br>
An annular air chamber 12c is formed between a portion<br>
formed to a smaller diameter on an outer circumferential part<br>
of the injection port 12b of the holder 12 and the attachment<br>
hole 3m, and the air chamber 12c communicates with the interior<br>
of the injection port 12b via a plurality (four in this<br>
embodiment) of communication ports 12d formed in a wall of the<br>
holder 12 so that the communication ports extend radially<br>
through the same wall at regular angular intervals. A<br>
downstream end opening (connection port) 13a of the sub-passage<br>
13 communicates with the air chamber 12c. The sub-passage 13<br>
extends along the intake port 3g toward an upstream side, and<br>
its upstream end opening 13b communicates with a space between<br>
the first and second throttle valves 5a, 5b in the throttle<br>
body 5.<br>
Out of the four communication ports 12d of this embodiment,<br>
the axes of two communication ports 12d positioned on the side<br>
of the downstream end opening 13a form an angle of 45° with<br>
respect to the axis of the downstream end opening 13a. That<br>
is, the communication ports 12d are formed in the direction<br>
that is offset from the downstream end opening 13a.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, to the throttle body 5, an intake pipe<br>
25 structuring the remaining part of the intake path is connected.<br>
This intake pipe 25 is first extending upward from the throttle<br>
body 5, then is extending upward towards the front obliquely<br>
along the lower plane of the main pipe 20b, and is connected<br>
to a connection port 26b protruded from the rear wall 26a of<br>
the air cleaner 26.<br>
In the air cleaner 2 6, a lid 2 6d is removably attached<br>
to the front side opening of a box body 2 6c, and elements are<br>
accommodated therein. This air cleaner 2 6 is placed behind<br>
the head pipe 20a in the lower front side of the main pipe 20b,<br>
and fixed to the main pipe 20b using a bolt. Here, reference<br>
numeral 26e is a duct directing the outside air to the air cleaner<br>
2 6 and this duct 2 6e opens towards the rear of the head pipe<br>
20a in the upper front part of the main pipe 20b.<br>
Reference numeral 27 denotes a fuel supply hose connected<br>
to the injector 11, and the fuel supply hose 27 extends upward<br>
towards the rear on the right side of the intake pipe 25 and<br>
the main pipe 20b and is connected to the fuel tank 24 via a<br>
fuel supply pump . Herein, the fuel supply hose 27 may be placed<br>
on the left side of the intake pipe and the main pipe.<br>
Thus, the motorcycle of this embodiment comprises a<br>
downward curved main pipe (main frame) 20b, an engine 1 and<br>
an air cleaner 2 6 arranged below the main pipe 2 0b, and an intake<br>
pipe 25 provided below the main pipe 20b and between the engine<br>
1 and air cleaner 26. The engine 1 comprises an intake valve<br>
mounting section in which an intake valve 7 for taking air into<br>
a cylinder is mounted, an exhaust valve mounting section in<br>
which an exhaust valve 6 for exhausting a gas from the cylinder<br>
is mounted, an intake port connected to the intake pipe for<br>
supplying outer air to the intake valve, an injector mounting<br>
section in which an injector 11 for ejecting a fuel is mounted<br>
and a fuel injection nozzle 11a (fuel injection opening) is<br>
arranged in a position between a stem of the intake valve 7<br>
and a center axis B of an intake port 3g and close to an end<br>
of the intake port 3g on the intake valve side, and a cylinder<br>
head 3 with which the intake valve mounting section, the exhaust<br>
valve mounting section, the intake port 3g and the injector<br>
mounting section are formed integral therewith. As shown in<br>
FIG. 4, the motorcycle provided with this engine 1 arranges the<br>
intake pipe 25 and the injector 11 in such a way as to be prevented<br>
from interfering with each other in a space surrounded by the<br>
front fender 32, main pipe 20b and engine 1.<br>
Then, the functions and effects of the unit, of the present<br>
embodiment will be explained.<br>
From the no-load operation period to a predetermined<br>
part-load operation period, the first throttle valve 5a on the<br>
downstream is fully closed, and the second throttle valve 5b<br>
is controllably opened or closed responding to the throttle<br>
operation.<br>
In the operation period where the load is smaller than<br>
the part-load operation period, the intake negative pressure<br>
on the engine side acts on the sub-passage 13 as it is and the<br>
intake air is entirely guided to the air chamber 12c from the<br>
throttle body 5 through the sub-passage 13. Then, the air<br>
introduced into this air chamber 12c is ejected therefrom to<br>
the jet opening 12b via the communication holes 12d and now<br>
the fuel ejected from the injection nozzle 11a is mixed with<br>
the fuel while being atomized. Then, the resulting air/gas<br>
mixture is supplied into the combustion chamber from the right<br>
and left intake valve openings 3e after going through the right<br>
and left sides of the recessed portion 3n formed in the partition<br>
wall 3h.<br>
In such a case, the injection nozzle lla of the injector<br>
is located closer to the intake valve opening 3e, that is, the<br>
injection nozzle lla is located in a position between the stem<br>
of the intake valve 7 and center axis B of the intake port 3g<br>
and close to the end of the intake port 3g on the intake valve<br>
side. More specifically, the fuel injection hole of the<br>
injection nozzle lla is located in such a position as to be<br>
closer to the cylinder axis A than a straight line C being parallel<br>
to the cylinder axis line A and passing through the intake side<br>
end part of the valve operating mechanism. Since the inj ection<br>
nozzle lla is close to the intake valve opening 3e, the fuel<br>
ejected from the injection nozzle lla is mixed with air and<br>
the resultant mixture is directly ejected into the intake valve<br>
opening 3e. Therefore, the area of the wall to which the fuel<br>
is adherent can be reduced in size and this resultantly reduces<br>
the amount of fuel that adheres to the wall and improves the<br>
fuel efficiency at the time of cold operation. Moreover, the<br>
exhaust gas properties can be prevented from becoming worse,<br>
which is often caused by discharge of unburned gases at the<br>
time of fuel cut or idling. Also the throttle response can<br>
be improved, i.e., the engine rotation speed increases without<br>
delay even if the throttle is abruptly operated.<br>
The air/gas mixture is supplied in the axial direction<br>
along the inner plane of the cylinder bore mainly from the exhaust<br>
part of a annular gap formed between the intake valve opening<br>
3e and the valve head 7a of the intake valve 7 located at the<br>
opening position thereof. With such a structure, tumbling<br>
(vertical vortexes) can be generated in the cylinder bore 2a<br>
with reliability, improving the combustion efficiency while<br>
accelerating atomization of the fuel. In the present<br>
embodiment, the cam shaft 8 is offset towards the exhaust side<br>
from the cylinder axis line A. Thereby, the angle 92 formed<br>
between the cylinder axis line A and the intake valve 7 is set<br>
so as to be smaller than the angle 1 formed between the cylinder<br>
axis line A and the exhaust valve 6. That is, the intake valve<br>
7 is placed upright closer to the cylinder axis line A.<br>
That is, the cylinder head 3 of the engine 1 is formed<br>
integral with the intake valve mounting section, the exhaust<br>
valve mounting section, the intake port, the fuel injection<br>
opening and the injector mounting section which is arranged<br>
in a position between the stem of the intake valve and the center<br>
axis B of the intake port and close to an end of the intake<br>
port on the intake valve side.<br>
As a result, a space can be saved in the intake part of<br>
the cylinder head 3 for having the injector 11 placed closer<br>
to the intake valve opening 3e and this resultantly reduces<br>
the amount of fuel attaching to the wall and improves the response<br>
and the combustion efficiency.<br>
The portion of the injection path in which the injection<br>
nozzle 11a is positioned and the portion of the throttle body<br>
(main passage) 5 which is between the first and second throttle<br>
valves 5a, 5b are communicated with each other by the sub-passage<br>
13, and the first throttle valve 5a is fully closed in an operation<br>
period between the no-load operation period to the predetermined<br>
partial load operation period. Therefore, a large quantity<br>
of intake air can be supplied reliably as the atomized air to<br>
the injection nozzle lla, so that the fuel atomization can be<br>
promoted.<br>
Furthermore, according to Embodiment 1, in the cylinder<br>
head 3 with which the exhaust valve 6 and intake valve 7 arranged<br>
symmetrically with respect to the cylinder axis as the center,<br>
and the intake port 3g arranged perpendicular to the axis of<br>
the cylinder bore 2b are formed integral, the injection nozzle<br>
lla at an end of the injector 11 is disposed at a position between<br>
the stem of the intake valve 7 and the center axis B of the<br>
intake port 3g and also close to an end of the intake port 3g<br>
on the intake valve side. For this reason, the injector 11<br>
is easily arranged at such a position that the diameter of an<br>
effective spot of the mixture of the fuel ejected from the fuel<br>
injection opening of the injection nozzle 11a and air at the<br>
intake valve opening is smaller than the radius of the intake<br>
valve opening 3e and the axis of the effective spot passes through<br>
the intake valve opening 3e and crosses the inner wall of the<br>
cylinder bore 2b at an acute angle.<br>
Furthermore, since the throttle body 5 is connected to<br>
the intake pipe 25 so that the throttle body 5 comes closer<br>
to the intake port 3g, it is possible to quickly respond to<br>
the opening and closing of the first and second throttle valves<br>
5a, 5b in the throttle body 5 and take the air into the cylinder<br>
bore 2b via the intake valve openings 3e. That is, the response<br>
to the throttle opening degree can be improved.<br>
Still further, the recessed portion 3n is formed to prevent<br>
the fuel ejected against the partition wall 3h forming the right<br>
and left branch paths 3i, 3i from colliding. Thus, even if .<br>
the injector 11 is placed in the center of these two branch<br>
paths 3i, 3i, the fuel ejected towards the two intake valve<br>
openings 3e, 3e as branch currents can be prevented from<br>
colliding and adhering to the partition wall 3h.<br>
In the present embodiment, the injector 11 is placed very<br>
close to the intake valve opening 3e of the cylinder head 3<br>
and the intake pipe 25 and the injector 11 are arranged so as<br>
not to interfere with each other, thus the injector 11 hardly<br>
interferes with the main pipe 20b when the engine 1 is fixed<br>
in suspension below the main pipe 20b.<br>
Thus, the flexibility at the time of fixing the engine<br>
1 to the main pipe 20b in suspension is not lost even if the<br>
injector is placed. Still further, it is easy to save the<br>
placement space for the throttle body 5 between the upper wall<br>
of the cylinder head 3 and the main pipe 20b, and thus the throttle<br>
response can be improved. Further, the number of bends of the<br>
intake pipe 25 is limited to one, and the bend R can be large.<br>
With such a structure, the intake resistance can be reduced.<br>
The intake pipe 25 is placed so as to be along the lower<br>
plane of the main pipe 2b, and the fuel supply hose 27 is placed<br>
on the same side thereof. Accordingly, the intake system and<br>
the fuel supply system can be simpler in placement structure.<br>
Here, in the above first embodiment, the throstle body 5 is<br>
directly connected to the upper wall of the cylinder head 3.<br>
In a second embodiment shown in FIG.8, an intake pipe 28 may<br>
be first extended upward then towards the front from the upper<br>
wall on the cylinder head 3, and then bent upward so as to be<br>
connected to a bottom plane 26f of the air cleaner 26. Then,<br>
the throttle body 5 including the throttle valve may be<br>
interposed in the part of the intake pipe 28 extending towards<br>
the front.<br>
Also in the present embodiment, the fuel supply hose 27<br>
is extending upward towards the rear on the right side of the<br>
intake pipe 28 and the main pipe 20b.<br>
When such a structure is applied, it is easy to save the<br>
placement space of the throttle body 5. Also, the throttle<br>
body 5 is disposed in the lateral direction, making it easier<br>
to place and locate the driving system, especially the driving<br>
cable.<br>
FIG.9 is a diagram for demonstrating a third embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
In the present third embodiment, the injector 11 is placed<br>
between the intake port 3g of the cylinder head 3 and the plane<br>
3b on the cylinder block 2 side. To be more specific, the<br>
injector 11 isplaced so that the fuel is directly ejected towards<br>
the combustion chamber via an intake valve opening 3e' from<br>
a branch path 3i' locating on the right side of the two intake<br>
valve openings 3e.<br>
In the present embodiment, the injector 11 is placed on<br>
the side of the intake valve opening 3e' locating on the right,<br>
the part having the injection nozzle lla of the injector 11<br>
located thereon and the part between the first and second<br>
throttle valves 5a and 5b of the throttle body 5 are communicated<br>
with each other by the sub-passage 13, and from the no-load<br>
to the predetermined part-load operation period, the first<br>
throttle valve 5a is fully closed. Thus, the intake air can<br>
be supplied a lot with reliability to the part of the injection<br>
nozzle lla as the atomized air. This allows the air/gas mixture<br>
of the fuel and the atomized air to go in the general direction<br>
along the inner circumference of the cylinder bore from the<br>
intake valve opening 3e' on the right side. With such a<br>
structure, horizontal vortexes (swirl) can be generated in the<br>
combustion chamber, accelerating the fuel atomization and<br>
improving the combustion efficiency.<br>
Also in such a case, the injector 11 is directly attached<br>
to the cylinder head 3, and the injection nozzle lla is placed<br>
very close to the intake valve opening 3e. This prevents the<br>
injector 11 from protruding a lot upv/ard, and the placement<br>
flexibilityof the engine from being reduced even if the injector<br>
11 is placed.<br>
This application is based on Japanese Patent Application<br>
No.2002-311486 filed on October 25, 2002, entire content of<br>
