				<td>Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method, a system and an intermediate node for providing<br>
multiuser streaming in a telecommunication system.<br>
Especially the present application is applicable in a wireless packet-switched <br><br>
telecommunication network.<br>
Background<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS is being developed to offer wireless<br>
wideband multimedia services. However streaming is also applicable to GSM, even though<br>
with a lower bandwidth. Images, voice, audio and video content are examples of mobile<br>
multimedia services, which are delivered to clients via media streaming and download<br>
techniques. It means once the content has been put onto a media server, it can be delivered on-<br>
demand via download or streaming. To download content, the user clicks for example on a<br>
link and waits for the content to be downloaded and playback to begin. Content streaming is<br>
done towards a single user by means of a unicast connection, when the user has requested<br>
this. The unicast connection is also called point-to-point communication.<br>
Multicast is a service that permits sources to send a single copy of the same data to an address<br>
that causes the data to be delivered to multiple recipients. With multicast only a single copy of<br>
a data item passes over any link in a network and copies of the data item are made only where<br>
paths diverge. From the network perspective, multicast dramatically reduces overall<br>
bandwidth consumption, since the data is replicated in the network at appropriate points rather<br>
than in the end-systems. Furthermore, a server that uses multicast to distribute the content to<br>
multiple receivers, must manage only one session.<br>
Local area networks have supported multicasting for many years. For networks, where nodes<br>
share a common communication medium multicasting is easy to support. A specially<br>
addressed packet can be read off the communication medium by multiple hosts.<br><br><br>
Multicasting in the internetworking between a fixed network, like for example the Internet or<br>
any other IP-based backbone network and a mobile network like, General Packet Radio<br>
System GPRS or Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS is currently<br>
developed, because especially in the wireless network new challenges occur. These challenges<br>
are for example the mobility of the end users and low transmission bandwidth of the mobile<br>
network on the air interface, but also the lower reliability due to the packet loss on the radio<br>
interface compared to the fixed networks.<br>
The currently discussed multicast/broadcast integration into UMTS and GSM is depicted in<br>
figure 1, which shows the architecture of multimedia broadcast/multicast. In figure 1 the most<br>
relevant nodes of GPRS or UMTS network and examples of the different access networks,<br>
like UTRAN and GERAN, are presented. The access networks are handled by means of a<br>
serving node, SGSN that communicates with an edge node, the GGSN that is responsible for<br>
connection to the external networks, like Internet. The BM-SC entity is responsible for the<br>
provision of multicast/broadcast, like for example for bearer establishment and data<br>
forwarding. However there is currently no solution existing, which works for multicasting of<br>
streaming. Since the idea is that the current BM-SC proposals simply forward the content.<br>
The functionality for handling a streaming flow is not included in the BM-SC.<br>
Currently the signalling and transmission of the streaming flow for a single user is performed<br>
in a wireless network by means of a Packet Switched Streaming architecture, which has a<br>
streaming server distributing the streaming flow to a streaming node, which can be realised by<br>
means of network integration nodes NINs. There are also solution, in which a content servers<br>
distributes the streaming content directly to the streaming clients on the user's side. These<br>
content servers are either the streaming servers or the NINs. The streaming nodes<br>
communicate with the GGSN that forwards the stream to the SGSN and then via the radio<br>
network to a user.<br>
Simply aggregating both solutions would lead to a system in which a streaming session is<br>
established for every user interested in receiving the streaming flow, implying that such a<br>
service will be very inefficiently deployed, especially in wireless networks, since it does not<br>
utilize the scarce radio resources in an optimal way. Furthermore although the transport may<br>
be multicast, a separate streaming session would be established per client with dedicated on-<br><br>
demand signalling messages. Further the adaptation will be done for the whole group and not<br>
on a per subgroup base, implying that the adaptation is general and not optimized for the<br>
different subgroups. Currently an individual adaptation can be achieved because all users have<br>
a separate and dedicated streaming session, wherein this solution leads to wasting of network<br>
resources.<br>
Therefore currently there is no integration between the multicast and the unicast streaming<br>
transmission, providing an efficient and effective solution.<br>
Summary and description of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient solution for providing multicast<br>
for streaming transmission within a telecommunication network.<br>
The invention is embodied in a method as disclosed in claims 1,15 and 16. Advantageous<br>
embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
The method of the basic idea for providing multicast for streaming transmission from a<br>
streaming server to a multicast group is disclosed in claim 1. The streaming server providing<br>
the streaming content can be located within the mobile network or in an external network. A<br>
multicast/broadcast server is responsible for providing multicast transmission. The task of<br>
said server is for example administration of the established multicast group, forwarding of the<br>
multicast data. A streaming node supports a streaming transmission. The streaming node is<br>
currently responsible for establishing a connection to a single user by means of an on-demand<br>
single-user signalling and optionally for an adaptation of the received streaming flow to the<br>
conditions of the network connection for the user. Further the streaming node can take care of<br>
the billing and charging procedure for the streaming receivers. On the basis of the known<br>
functionality the present invention proposes to integrate logically or/and physically the<br>
streaming node and the multicast/broadcast server building an intermediate node and to add<br>
the following functionality.<br>
The intermediate node receives a message initiating an establishment of a multicast bearer<br>
according to the requirements for streaming transmission. The intermediate node establishes a<br><br>
session on the multicast bearer by translating the on-demand single-user signalling received<br>
from the streaming server into multi-user push signalling being sent to the group members.<br>
An important advantage of the multi-user push signalling is the achievement of the<br>
synchronisation of the multicast group members. The intermediate node has the functionality<br>
of adapting the received streaming flow to the multicast transmission according to the needs<br>
of a multicast group or a subgroup. Further the intermediate node replicates the received<br>
streaming transmission according the number of the multicast subgroups.<br>
In the following the term intermediate node describes a logical or a physical combination of<br>
the streaming node and of the multicast/broadcast server for the purpose of the present<br>
invention.<br>
There are different ways of ordering the broadcast/multicast server and the streaming node<br>
within the intermediate node.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the streaming node communicating with the server adapts<br>
the streaming transmission and forwards the adapted streaming transmission to the<br>
multicast/broadcast server, which replicates the received streaming transmission among the<br>
subgroups of a multicast group. The advantage of this solution is that the streaming node<br>
performs an adaptation for the whole group or a subgroup, it means before the replication is<br>
done in the multicast/broadcast server.<br>
In a further embodiment the multicast/broadcast server communicating with the server<br>
replicates the received streaming transmission among the subgroups of a multicast group and<br>
forwards each replicated streaming transmission to the streaming node, which adapts each<br>
streaming transmission. The smallest subgroup consists of one user. The advantage of this<br>
solution is that the streaming node is able to do a dedicated adaptation for specific subgroups<br>
with the same characteristics, like for example all users served by the same SGSN or all users<br>
receiving the service in the same access network, for example GSM or WCDMA.<br>
Furthermore, the multicast/broadcast server may select different streaming nodes for the<br>
different replications of a stream, like for example for load balancing reasons or because the<br>
streaming nodes have different capabilities.<br><br>
In a further embodiment the intermediate node has a decision unit for deciding whether the<br>
received streaming flow is to be directed first to the multicast/broadcast server or to the<br>
streaming node. It means the deciding unit decides either to direct the streaming flow to the<br>
multicast/broadcast server and then to the streaming node or it directs it to the streaming node<br>
and then to the multicast/broadcast server. The flow can also be directed only to the<br>
multicast/broadcast server. It can be also decided that no replication in the multicast/broadcast<br>
server is needed, because for example all users are in the same cell. The decision can also be<br>
that the involvement of a multicast/broadcast server or a streaming node is not required at all.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention there are different streaming nodes being<br>
identified by means of addresses and the streaming nodes may differ regarding different<br>
capabilities. The multicast/broadcast server knows the addresses and the different capabilities<br>
and said multicast/broadcast server has the capability to select an appropriate streaming node<br>
for performing an appropriate adaptation of the streaming flow.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, in which a hierarchical coding is used, the<br>
streaming flows are differentiated in the sense that a different number of layers are sent to<br>
different streaming nodes. In the hierarchical coding there is the base layer being sent to every<br>
user and additionally there are enhancement layers on top that can for example increase frame<br>
rate or spatial resolution for users requesting it. The multicast groups can be distinguished<br>
regarding the number of levels being able and/or willing to receive.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the intermediate node handles the received<br>
address(es) identifying the receiver(s) of the streaming flow. It may be required to perform a<br>
translation of a unicast address into a multicast address. The unicast address can be included<br>
in an on-demand single-user signalling received from the server. It is also possible that the<br>
received address from the server is a multicast address, implying that the translation between<br>
two different multicast addresses may be needed. This case occurs, when the<br>
broadcast/multicast server is part of a multicast group receiving content from the server,<br>
because the operator has several broadcast/multicast servers and the distribution of the content<br>
to all broadcast/multicast servers is done by means of multicast. Therefore the external<br>
multicast address received from the server is translated into the internal multicast address used<br>
on the interface towards the users. It is also possible that the handling requires only<br><br>
forwarding to the appropriate multicast group, because the same multicast address is used<br>
between the server and the intermediate node and between the intermediate node and the<br>
multicast groups. It is advantageous to have different possibilities to inform the<br>
multicast/broadcast server about the streaming node, for example this can be event-based<br>
messages sent from an operator to the multicast/broadcast server and to the streaming node on<br>
which reaction the multicast/broadcast server sends a request message to the sender and<br>
receives an acknowledgement message with all the relevant parameters. In a further<br>
embodiment the operator administrates this information or the multicast/broadcast server may<br>
regularly request the information from the streaming servers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the intermediate node receives a session<br>
description message like for example Session Description Protocol SDP inside of a Real Time<br>
Steaming Protocol RTSP message from the server informing about the transmission<br>
parameters required for the streaming session. The intermediate node can decide by receiving<br>
the session description message which streaming node can be taken in order to fulfil the<br>
requirements for the streaming session. This session description info is forwarded to the group<br>
members by means of the multi-user push signalling message, like for example SDP inside of<br>
a Session Initiation Protocol SIP or Session Adaptation Protocol SAP message.<br>
Further it is proposed that the intermediate node by receipt of a session description message<br>
informing about the transmission parameters required for the streaming session changes the<br>
received parameters according to the needs of the subgroups and sends the changed<br>
parameters to the group members by means of the multi-user push signalling message. The<br>
advantage of this solution is that a dedicated adaptation according to the users requirements<br>
can be performed.<br>
For the realisation of the dedicated adaptation nodes higher up in the hierarchy are informed<br>
that the streaming flow is only to be forwarded to a single node lower in the hierarchy. It<br>
means in case of a dedicated adaptation for an SGSN-area as an example nodes like, the<br>
GGSN, BM-SC and NIN must be informed that the streaming flow is only to be sent to that<br>
specific SGSN. As mentioned before the decision of dedicated adaptations is taken in the<br>
intermediate node. A new message is then to be distributed along the multicast delivery tree,<br><br>
indicating the streaming flow and the destination, for example a certain SGSN. All nodes in-<br>
between will set the distribution tree information accordingly for that specific stream.<br>
Further it is proposed that the conversion between single-user on-demand and multi-user push<br>
signalling implies that certain messages are not propagated. In a preferred embodiment it is<br>
not required that all the users send an answer about the acceptance of the parameters, when<br>
they registered to a group advertising certain parameters and thus already indicated that they<br>
are willing and able to receive the content with these conditions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the replication of the streaming flow is<br>
based on an access network, in which users are located or/and is based on the geographic area<br>
and/or on the Quality of Service requested by the group members. The advantage of this<br>
solution is the definition of different subgroups within a multicast group so that the<br>
subgrouping can better satisfy the users requirements, for example considering their current<br>
access network characteristics and status.<br>
It is proposes that in order the intermediate node is aware of the available QoS in the<br>
corresponding area, the intermediate requests the actual characteristics of the area in order to<br>
adapt the streaming flow accordingly. This implies for example that the intermediate node is<br>
provided with the addresses of the corresponding subarea or access nodes, such as the SGSN<br>
or the RNC. From these nodes the intermediate node can then request the actual<br>
characteristics of the subarea.<br>
Since the intermediate node administrates all the multicast traffic sent to the group members,<br>
including the dedicated (sub-)group adaptations, it can provide more accurate charging, and in<br>
a further preferred embodiment the intermediate node provides additional information to the<br>
charging/billing server in order to be able to do an accurate charging and/or multi-user<br>
streaming related charging. The information provided to the charging/billing server is the<br>
number of group members, the reception quality, which is received in the feedback from the<br>
group members, according to which an adaptation may be done, the streaming flow<br>
characteristics, the number of group members per adapted/replicated streaming flow, etc.<br><br>
Further it is proposed to have an intermediate node being adapted to provide multicast for<br>
streaming transmission from a streaming server to users of a multicast group with a<br>
multicast/broadcast server providing multicast transmission and with a streaming node<br>
providing a streaming transmission and based on an on-demand single-user signalling<br>
supporting the transmission of a streaming flow. Said intermediate node includes the<br>
multicast/broadcast server and the streaming node with the following additionally<br>
functionality. Bearer establishing means for establishing a bearer for a multicast transmission<br>
according to the requirements for streaming transmission received from the server. Further<br>
there is session establishing means for establishing a multi-user streaming session on the<br>
bearer by translating the on-demand single-user signalling received from the streaming server<br>
into multi-user push signalling. The adaptation means is responsible for adapting the received<br>
streaming flow to the multicast transmission according to the needs of a multicast group. The<br>
replication means is responsible for the replication of the streaming flow among the<br>
subgroups.<br>
Further a system being adapted to provide multicast for streaming transmission from a<br>
streaming server to users of a multicast group with a multicast/broadcast server providing<br>
multicast transmission and with a streaming node providing a streaming transmission and<br>
with an on-demand single-user signalling supporting the transmission of a streaming flow,<br>
wherein said system has an intermediate node according to claim 15 and the method<br>
according to claim 1 is performed within the system.<br>

The description of the possible technical realisation of the present invention is based on the<br>
network architectures according to figure 1 and 2. Therefore in the following description the<br>
broadcast/multicast server will be called BM-SC. The Network Integration Node NIN is an<br>
example of a streaming node supporting streaming protocols like for example RTSP, RTP,<br>
RTCP. However in the following an example is given with the architecture having the NIN,<br>
this should not be seen as a restriction for the present invention.<br>
In the following the different possibilities of the direction of the streaming flow within the<br>
intermediate node, which can be called Multicast Streaming Proxy MSP regarding the order<br>
of adaptation and replication are described in more details.<br>
In one embodiment the BM-SC is integrated between the NIN and the GGSN as depicted in<br>
figure 2. Figure 2 shows a server sending the streaming flow to the intermediate node. Within<br>
the intermediate node the NIN is the first node that is contacted. Said NIN communicates on<br>
the other hand with the BM-SC. The numbers on the arrows indicate the number of flows that<br>
are to be sent on said link. Thus at first an adaptation of the received stream in the NIN is<br>
performed, 10, and then the stream is sent to the BM-SC, 20, being responsible for the<br>
replication, n, indicating the replication of the stream for n subgroups. The stream(s) is/are<br>
sent to the GGSN and respectively to the SGSN. Additionally a communication with the so-<br>
called C&amp;B Prepaid node takes place regarding the forwarding of charging and billing related<br>
data. The benefit of this solution is that the NIN does a general adaptation for the whole group<br>
before the replication is performed in the BM-SC.<br><br>
In another embodiment the BM-SC is integrated between the streaming server and the NIN, as<br>
reflected in figure 3, in which the server sends a streaming flow to the BM-SC being<br>
responsible for the replication. The replicated streams are forwarded to the NIN or NINs,<br>
which perform(s) the adaptation. Respectively the n streams are distributed to subgroups<br>
passing GGSN and SGSNs. The benefit of this solution is that the NIN provides a dedicated<br>
adaptation for specific subgroups with the same characteristics, like for example all members<br>
served by the same SGSN or residing in the same access network. Furthermore, the BM-SC<br>
may select different NINs for the different replicated streams.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention in order to increase the flexibility a decision<br>
is taken, over which path the received streaming flow within the intermediate node is to be<br>
directed. The path is determined by means of configuration, depending on the group or other<br>
criteria. The issue here is that different paths are possible, even simultaneously and that<br>
certain criteria are used to establish and maintain the most appropriate path. This solution is<br>
reflected in figure 4. A logical unit, called Path Determination Logic (PDL), determines the<br>
optimal path of the streams and the corresponding signalling messages. In the figure 4 the<br>
logical PDL is co-located with the BM-SC. In general the PDL may be a standalone entity or<br>
it may be co-located with any other network entity as long as the corresponding interfaces to<br>
the other network entities exist.<br>
The PDL selects and creates a path via the intermediate node. The selection criteria depend on<br>
the benefit, which is to be achieved, it means it is required to adapt the streaming flow for the<br>
whole group or the requirement is to adapt individual streams dedicated to different<br>
subgroups. The benefits are discussed above. The selection can be applied on a per content or<br>
content provider base. Input for the selection is given by the operator for example by means of<br>
a corresponding management interface or by the content server or by the BM-SC, which has<br>
the advantage that the selection is group driven.<br>
In the following some examples of selection scenarios are discussed. In case a service is<br>
offered where one quality level has to fit all wishes. For example due to a reduced tariff a<br>
common stream adaptation in the NIN might be sufficient. In contrary in case a service<br>
quality is to be achieved the content is to be first replicated in the BM-SC and then a<br>
dedicated adaptation per SGSN, RNC or even per cell is to be performed.<br><br>
When the intermediate node determines certain parameters for a subgroup then said<br>
parameters are to be sent to the subgroup. They confirm the possibility for receiving a<br>
streaming flow with these parameters, unless the signalling is changed to push signalling in<br>
which case the network does not expect or require a confirmation from the group members. It<br>
is also possible that a subgroup sends at session establishment a request for expected quality<br>
and then the intermediate node has to select the appropriate adaptation. The reception quality<br>
reporting per subarea is done via standard mechanisms, such as the Real-time Transport<br>
Control Protocol, RTCP, which reports on a per subscriber level or any other mechanism, like<br>
for example collective reporting by the RNC. The intermediate node or the streaming server is<br>
the receiver of these reception quality reports. The stream to be adapted is determined from<br>
the stream identifier in a Real-time Transport Control Protocol RTCP report. Alternatively a<br>
subarea identifier can be included in the RTCP report, which is then used by the NIN or the<br>
server to adapt the corresponding stream.<br>
In the following the establishment of a streaming session is described in more details. In<br>
particular the translation of the on-demand single-user signalling received from the streaming<br>
server into multi-user push signalling is discussed. The RTSP protocol is an example of an<br>
on-demand single-user signalling, because it is a client-server protocol, providing an<br>
interaction between two entities. The Session Initiation Protocol SIP is used as an example for<br>
a multi-user push signalling. SIP is a protocol, which provides functionality for performing<br>
actions initiated by the network without that the user requests it explicitly. Thus it is push-<br>
based protocol. Further the SIP provides the option for multicast addressing, it means a<br>
number of user can be requested with one message. Although the SIP protocol was developed<br>
for a point-to-point transmission, it supports multicast addressing. In the present invention it<br>
is used for multicast signalling.<br>
Therefore SIP fulfils the requirements of a multi-user push signalling protocol. Further<br>
example for the a multi-user push signalling protocol is the combination of SIP and Session<br>
Description Protocol SDP, SIP/SDP , wherein the messages are SIP, but the stream<br>
description contained in the SIP messages is based on the SDP. Further the SIP/SDP<br>
messages can be replaced by corresponding Session Announcement Protocol SAP/SDP<br>
messages.<br><br>
These protocols are merely examples for the multi-user push signalling and therefore they do<br>
not restrict the scope of the invention.<br>
Multi-user streaming session establishment is described in respect to figure 5, which depicts<br>
the signalling flow between the Server, the NIN, the BM-SC and the members of a multicast<br>
group {UE}. At first the Server and the BM-SC are notified about a certain multicast service.<br>
The service notification can be realised by means of distribution of event-based messages<br>
from an operator, web-server or any other source to the BM-SC and the Server. With this<br>
solution the BM-SC is informed about servers offering multicast services. However there are<br>
different possibilities. Usually the info is available on web pages, distributed for example via<br>
e-mail or SAP messages. This information may be distributed by means of multicast or by<br>
means of papers to the operators administrating such information.<br>
According to figure 5 in the first step the BM-SC requests a content description, by means of<br>
the RTSP: Describe message in order to see whether and how to handle the stream. Implicitly<br>
with this message the server is informed about the BM-SC as a streaming client for that<br>
particular session. It is necessary that the BM-SC knows the location of the Server, indicating<br>
only examples for receiving this information either the BM-SC has the addresses of the<br>
servers from the operator or this information is indicated by the user in corresponding Real-<br>
Time Transport Session Protocol RTSP message flows. The RTSP is a protocol responsible<br>
for establishment and for control of a session for point-to-point real-time applications,<br>
although it supports multicast addressing. The RTSP.DESCRIBE from the BM-SC to the<br>
streaming server can optionally includes the number of clients that this RTSP applies to in<br>
order to enable for example the proper charging of the mobile operator by the streaming<br>
service provider. The Server answers to the BM-SC with RTSP.200 OK (SDP-info), which is<br>
an acknowledgment specified in RTSP. This acknowledgment carries as parameters the<br>
Session Description Protocol information, SDP-info, like for example the required buffer size,<br>
the required transport bandwidth. According to this information the BM-SC establishes a<br>
multicast bearer for the certain multicast group when the streaming is about to start. In order<br>
to inform the users about incoming streaming session with the corresponding parameters a<br>
SIP: Invite message is sent. The users send the message SIP: 200 OK acknowledging the<br>
readiness for the streaming session. After that step a RTSP connection between the BM-SC<br><br>
and the Server by means of RTSP.SETUP and RTSP:200OK is established. It is also possible<br>
that the RTSP-Setup and RTSP:200 OK are exchanged before the transmission of the SIP<br>
message to the users. The RTSP.SETUP message can include parameters being changed<br>
according to performed negotiation and the Server answers with RTSP.200OK, whether he is<br>
able to accept a connection with the changed parameters. The changed parameters can be sent<br>
to the group members by means of a SIP:ACK message acknowledging to the group members<br>
the accepted changes and closing the streaming session establishment procedure. As next the<br>
transmission of the streaming flow is performed by means of a RTSP Play message, receipt of<br>
which is acknowledged by means of a RTSP.200OK message.<br>
It means the intermediate node acts like a single or multiple group members towards the<br>
streaming server, simulating one group member per GGSN, SGSN, RNC, or even cell. It is<br>
also possible to simulate a group member per QoS subgroup. Towards the users it acts like a<br>
SIP server or remote client, inviting these users for a streaming session by translating the<br>
single user flows into multi-user flows. In the direction from the server to the users the<br>
intermediate node may interpret and modify the corresponding RTSP messages before<br>
propagating these as SIP messages. Modifications of messages can include the filtering of the<br>
SDP information according to the sub-network characteristics where the RTSP message and<br>
afterwards the RTP frames will be replicated. It means the BM-SC reduces QoS in SDP in<br>
case the access network is not able to handle the QoS or the operator does not allow such a<br>
QoS for that specific service. This is done by the generation of the RTSP.SETUP message.<br>
Further modification of the messages received from the Server can be that the BM-SC does<br>
not propagate the message, like for example the last RTSP:200 OK in the sequence in figure 5<br>
must not be propagated. Further the BM-SC is responsible for changing the unicast address to<br>
a multicast address in the corresponding messages in case this is required.<br>
In the direction from the users to the server the intermediate node may modify the<br>
corresponding RTSP message content before sending it to the server. Modifications of<br>
messages can be for example the replication of the number of RTSP SETUP message and<br>
sending a SETUP message per multicast subgroup. In case a translation of addresses is<br>
required the BM-SC changes the multicast address to a unicast address<br><br>
In order to reduce the signalling for multi-user streaming sessions, and especially the number<br>
of messages sent on the radio interface, the signalling sequence can be optimized for multi-<br>
user streaming sessions in wireless networks. This optimization is depicted in figure 6.<br>
In figure 6 the communication between a Server via the intermediate node to users being in<br>
two different access networks, {UE-1} and {UE-2}, is shown. The establishment of a bearer<br>
between the BM-SC and the group members according to the Server SDP-info is handled in a<br>
similar way as described in respect to figure 5. The difference is the filtering and the<br>
replication performed in the intermediate node before the first SIP :INVITE message is sent.<br>
As described before the BM-SC replicates the content and takes care of the necessary filtering<br>
of the SDP information and later the streamed content. The users indicate their interest in the<br>
service/content before or during registering to the multicast group and since the content is<br>
anyhow broadcasted on the air-interface, the actual service can be regarded as a push service<br>
in the sense that the users are just informed that the content will come by means of the SIP:<br>
INVITE message and then they wait for the arrival of the streaming flow. This message is<br>
either sent via unicast or broadcast/multicast to the users per area. It means users being in<br>
different access networks are distinguished, because according to the access network different<br>
Quality of Service requirements may have to be fulfilled.<br>
This optimization reduces the signalling time delays and the number of messages to be sent on<br>
the radio interface. The users can be optionally informed about this optimization for multi-<br>
user streaming by means of an indication in the SIP INVITE message, which states that the<br>
next thing to be received is the actual streaming content. Optionally time or time period can<br>
be indicated to prepare the user for the reception of the streaming content.<br>
Above the general idea was described without considering the order of performing the<br>
adaptation and replication of the streaming flow.<br>
In the following the signalling exchange is described considering the order of the adaptation<br>
and replication of the streaming flow. This is to be distinguished by implementing the order of<br>
placing the BM-SC and the NIN within an intermediate node or in case the intermediate node<br>
has a decision unit for deciding about the way a streaming flow has to pass the corresponding<br>
entities within the intermediate node.<br><br>
As mentioned above the BM-SC has information about the addresses of the servers. Further<br>
the BM-SC has also the addresses of the NINs, wherein the BM-SC either administrates the<br>
addresses or it has any other server discovery mechanism in order to be able to contact the<br>
NINs and link these into the path. In case of a network with multiple NINs having different<br>
capabilities, the BM-SC is aware of the capabilities either because they are administrated in<br>
the network or because NINs register to the BM-SC with their capabilities. These capabilities<br>
are used to select the appropriate NIN. This implies that different NINs can be selected by the<br>
BM-SC, for the adaptation of the streaming flow depending on the required capabilities. In<br>
the following some examples are given for capabilities to be considered. For example the<br>
available resources can be considered. Further the BM-SC distinguishes according to the<br>
adaptation speed, wherein the speed can depend on the used processors and/or on the<br>
reception quality reporting speed and/or the applied method. Further example is the supported<br>
wireless specific adaptation. This can be done on high level distinguishing between the<br>
different networks like for example GSM, WCDMA, WLAN, or more detailed by<br>
distinguishing the different specific parameters like the bandwidth, from 300 to 64 kbps, or<br>
the delay from 2 ms to 5 ms and corresponding buffering. Another example for distinguishing<br>
the NINs is the charging support, for example due to specific prepaid solutions based on<br>
different solutions like CAMEL, RADIUS, or DIAMETER. The available buffer size per<br>
stream indicating an overflow risk can be considered as a criterion for distinguishing the<br>
NINs. Further examples can be the supported wireless specific compression and security<br>
algorithms or the supported error protection mechanisms.<br>
At first in respect to figure 7 the solution is described in which the streaming flow is<br>
forwarded at first through the NIN in order to adapt it accordingly and then through BM-SC<br>
for replication. The figure 7 includes two different NINs, NIN1 and NIN2 and two different<br>
subareas with multiple users {UE-1} and {UE-2}.<br>
As described in respect to figure 5 and 6 the BM-SC sends an RTSP: Describe to the server<br>
and receives the SDP-info. With that info it determines the NIN(s) to be allocated, taking into<br>
account the access networks or the subareas, where the users have registered, the capabilities<br>
of the different NINs and the selection criteria in the BM-SC. The BM-SC then allocates the<br>
corresponding resources in the NIN(s), like for example streaming adaptation resources may<br><br>
be reserved. This is beneficial in order to avoid that the resources are not available wnen tne<br>
streaming session is starting. However, an operator may also decide not to reserve the<br>
resource but to take a small risk that the resources are not available later on. In the figure 7<br>
only one NIN, NIN-2, is used for all streams. The BM-SC informs the server about the NINs,<br>
basically the NIN addresses are exchanged. This information may also be sent later in the<br>
SETUP or PLAY message. After that the SIP:invite messages are sent respectively for the<br>
different areas. The RTSP: SETUP and RTSP:PLAY messages are handled as described in<br>
respect to figure 5 and 6. These may also be sent indirectly via the NIN in order for the NIN<br>
to be aware of the start of the stream. This may particularly be interesting for the RTSP .PLAY<br>
message.<br>
The server sends two streams to NIN-2. Both are adapted according to the rules determined<br>
earlier and the streams are forwarded to the users in subarea-1 and subarea-2 respectively.<br>
Alternatively two or more different NINs could have been selected.<br>
In respect to figure 8 the situation is described, in which at first the streams are replicated<br>
before their adaptation is performed. The difference to figure 7 is that in figure 7 the<br>
replication is done in the server possibly ordered by the BM-SC, whereas in figure 8 the<br>
replication is done in the BM-SC.<br>
As in the previous signalling sequences the BM-SC sends an RTSP:Describe to the server and<br>
receives the SDP-info. With that info it determines the NIN(s) to be allocated, taking into<br>
account the access networks or subareas where the users have registered, the capabilities of<br>
the different NINs and the selection criteria in the BM-SC. The BM-SC then allocates the<br>
corresponding resources in the NIN(s) and the corresponding SIP:INVITE messages for the<br>
respective subareas are sent. In the figure 8 two NINs are used for all streams. The<br>
RTSP.SETUP and RTSP:PLAY messages are handled as before.<br>
The server sends a single stream to the BM-SC, which replicates this into two streams and<br>
forwards one stream to NIN-1 and the other to NIN-2. Both are adapted according to the rules<br>
determined earlier and the streams are forwarded to the users in subarea-1 and subarea-2<br>
respectively. In case hierarchical coding is used, the streams to NIN-1 and NIN-2 may be<br>
different in the sense that a different number of layers are sent to each NIN, wherein the base<br><br>
layer is sent to both NINs and depending on the requirements a different number of the<br>
enhancement layers are sent to the different NINs.<br>
With the present invention it is possible to perform a dedicated adaptation for areas covered<br>
by a GGSN, SGSN, RNC or NodeB, which means areas that are smaller than the coverage<br>
offered by a NIN or BM-SC. Furthermore, it is possible to do a dedicated adaptation per QoS<br>
subgroup, which may imply that more subgroups per geographical area, including a cell may<br>
exist. In order to realize it the nodes higher up in the hierarchy must be informed that the<br>
stream is only to be forwarded to a single node lower in the hierarchy. It means in case of a<br>
dedicated adaptation for an SGSN-area, the GGSN, BM-SC and NIN must be informed that<br>
the stream is only to be sent to that specific SGSN. As mentioned before the decision of<br>
dedicated adaptations is taken in the intermediate node. A new message is then to be<br>
distributed along the multicast delivery tree, indicating the stream and the destination for<br>
example a certain SGSN. All nodes in-between will set the distribution tree info accordingly<br>
for that specific stream.<br>
It was mentioned for the NIN or the BM-SC to be aware of the available QoS in the<br>
corresponding subarea. This implies that the replication information must be accompanied by<br>
the addresses of the corresponding subarea or access nodes, such as the SGSN or the RNC.<br>
From these nodes the NIN or the BM-SC can then request the actual characteristics of the<br>
subarea in order to instruct the NIN adaptation logic accordingly.<br>
In the following the replication of the multi-user streaming in the intermediate node or in the<br>
server upon request from the BM-SC is described in more details. The replication can be<br>
based on the different criteria. For example a replication is done to all members in a specific<br>
access network with specific access characteristics, like bandwidth it means one streaming<br>
flow goes to GSM users, one goes to UMTS users and one stream to users with WLAN<br>
access. The information about the access characteristic of the users is assumed to be available<br>
in the BM-SC or has to be included in the corresponding multicast group registration<br>
procedures. Another example is that the replication is performed to all members in a specific<br>
geographical area, served by a GGSN, SGSN, RNC or even each individual user. This kind of<br>
location information is also known to the BM-SC. This node has to know the NINs per<br><br>
4	f<br>
port/link in case the replication is done to all users served by a specific NIN with a certain<br>
type or a certain version.<br>
Basically, the BM-SC can replicate the same content in multiple streams with different<br>
characteristics. These streams can then get a dedicated and optimal treatment and adaptation<br>
in the NIN.<br>
As described above once the session is established the payload can be streamed to the multi-<br>
user group. The initial replication is done by the server, which sends multiple different<br>
streams. The BM-SC acts as one or several group members towards the server and as a server<br>
towards the group members. Furthermore, it takes care of the necessary addressing<br>
adaptations.<br>
In the following the charging and billing solution for the present invention is described. As<br>
already mentioned with the present invention an efficient solution is achieved for performing<br>
charging and billing for a multicast group receiving streaming flows.<br>
The intermediate node coordinates the whole multi-user session and has all relevant<br>
information. Said node knows for example the users, the reception quality, the stream<br>
characteristics, the number of users per stream adaptation. All this information can be<br>
provided to the charging and billing servers in order to have a very accurate and fair charging<br>
policy applied. Since more accurate reception quality information is received by the NIN<br>
since it treats smaller subgroups, this information can be used to do a more accurate charging<br>
and billing for the multi-user service.<br>
The described embodiments, in particular for UMTS should not be seen as a restriction for the<br>
present invention. Since this invention also applies to GPRS and can actually also be used in<br>
other wireless systems like for example WLAN together with a UMTS core network.<br><br>
