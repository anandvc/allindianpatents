COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"GENERATED VOLTAGE BOOSTING METHOD FOR GENERATOR"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
5<br>
18-10-2001<br><br><br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTON OF THE INVENTION] [TECHNICAL FIELD TO WHICH THE INVENTION BELONGS]<br>
This invention relates to a generated voltage boosting method for a generator which, even when the generated voltage is low upon starting of an engine, can supply a sufficient voltage to a fuel supplying system and an ignition system to augment the starting performance of the engine. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
As a generated voltage boosting method for boosting an output generated by a generator so as to be supplied to a fuel supplying system load or other electric loads upon starting of an engine, a method disclosed, for example, in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 8-51731(1995), entitled "Power Supply Apparatus for Internal Combustion Engine" is known. [0003]<br>
In FIG. 3 of the official gazette mentioned above, a first power supply circuit 10 is disclosed wherein a boosting rectification circuit 10a composed of a MOSFET <f1 another mosfet and rectifying diodes d21 d22 an fet control circuit connected between dc output terminals tl t2 of the boosting rectification for applying drive signals vg to gates are provided on a></f1>
2<br><br>
generation coil Wp. [0004]<br>
The boosting rectification circuit 10a is a bridge full wave rectification circuit formed by a bridge connection of the rectifying diodes D21 and D22, a parasitic diode Dfl connected between the drain and the source of the MOSFET (Fl), and another parasitic diode Df2 connected between the drain and the source of the MOSFET (F2) . The drive signals Vg of a rectangular waveform are applied from the FET control circuit 10b to the MOSFET (Fl) and the MOSFET (F2) to control the MOSFET (Fl) and the MOSFET (F2) on/off to cause the generation coil Wp to generate a high voltage, and the high voltage is rectified by the bridge full wave rectification • circuit to obtain a DC output, which is supplied to a fuel pump 11. [0005] [Subject to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
With the technique of the official gazette described above, while the generated voltage of the generator upon starting of the engine is so low that the FET control circuit 10b does not start up and boosting is not performed, a necessary voltage cannot be obtained, and the fuel pump 11 or an ignition system cannot be<br>
3<br><br>
activated. Even if it is tried to start the engine, much time is required for starting of the engine until the voltage rises sufficiently. [0006]<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention resides in provision of a generated voltage boosting method for a generator wherein, even when the generated voltage is low upon starting of an engine, a sufficient voltage can be supplied to a fuel supplying system and an ignition system to start the engine in an early stage. . [0007] [Means to Solve the Subject]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to claim 1, a generated voltage boosting method for a generator wherein, in order to charge a battery with and/or supply a DC output to an electric load, an AC generator is driven by an engine and an AC output generated by the AC generator is rectified, and then chopper operation of converting the DC output obtained by the rectification once into AC current and boosting and rectifying the AC current is performed, is characterized in that, in the chopper operation, a step of inputting an oscillation pulse signal produced by an oscillator to the DC output to boost the DC.  output and  a step of inputting<br>
i<br>
4<br><br>
a CPU pulse signal produced by a central processing unit to the DC output to boost the EC output- are executed. [0008]<br>
Since the boosting with the oscillation pulse signal of the oscillator and the boosting with the CPU pulse signal of the central processing unit are performed, for example, when the generated voltage of the generator is low upon starting of the engine, boosting is performed first by one of the oscillator and the central processing unit, and then boosting is performed by the other. [0009]<br>
Consequently, boosting can be performed efficiently within the boosting ranges individually of the oscillator and the central processing unit. Accordingly, upon starting of the engine, a sufficient voltage can be supplied to the fuel supplying system or the ignition system of the engine, and starting of the engine can be performed in an early stage. [0010]<br>
According to claim 2, the generated voltage boosting method for a generator is characterized in that the oscillator can produce the oscillation pulse signal with an activation voltage lower than an activation voltage with which the central processing unit can<br>
5<br><br>
produce the CPU pulse signal. [0011]<br>
Since boosting is performed in two steps such that, for example, when the generated voltage of the generator is low, the DC output is boosted with the oscillation pulse signal produced by the oscillator, and then when the generated voltage becomes not  less  than  the activation voltage of the central processing unit, the DC output is boosted with the CPU pulse signal produced by the central processing unit, even if the generated voltage is low and the central processing unit is not in an activated state upon starting of the engine, a sufficiently high voltage can be supplied to the ignition system or the fuel supplying system of the engine, and the starting performance of the engine can be improved. 10012]<br>
Further, when starting of the engine is performed by a kick starting apparatus, the generated voltage can be assured only by operating the kick starting apparatus with a weak operation force, and the kick starting can be performed readily. [0013]<br>
According to claim 3, the generated voltage boosting method for -a generator is characterized in that<br>
6<br><br>
the central processing unit produces the CPU pulse signal for a predetermined time after an activation voltage thereof is reached.<br>
Where the central processing unit produces the CPU pulse signal for the predetermined time, the predetermined time can be used, for example, as a waiting time for detecting an ignition pulser signal. If an ignition pulser signal is detected within the predetermined time, then also after the predetermined time, production of the CPU pulse signal can be continued<br>
until the boosting with the CPU pulse signal becomes<br>
required. [0014]-<br>
According to claim 4, the generated voltage<br>
boosting method for a generator is characterized in that<br>
the central processing unit starts production of the CPU<br>
pulse signal when the central processing unit detects<br>
that the engine begins to rotate.<br>
Since the CPU pulse signal is generated when the<br>
engine begins to rotate, that is, when the generator<br>
begins to generate power, the generated voltage can be<br>
boosted efficiently.<br>
[0015]<br>
According to claim 5, the generated voltage<br>
7<br><br>
boosting method for a generator is characterized in that the central processing unit stops the production of the CPU pulse signal when the speed of the engine is not less than a predetermined value or the voltage of the battery is not less than a predetermined value.<br>
Since the generated voltage is raised sufficiently when the engine speed is not less than the predetermined value or the voltage of the battery is not less than the predetermined value, useless power consumption can be suppressed by stopping the production of the CPU pulse signal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a generated voltage boosting apparatus (110) for a generator wherein, in order to charge a battery with and/or supply a DC output to an electric load, an AC generator (33) is driven by an engine and an AC output generated by said AC generator is rectified, and then chopper operation apparatus (44) of converting the DC output obtained by the rectification once into AC current and boosting and rectifying the AC current is performed, characterized in that, in the chopper operation apparatus (44), a step of inputting an oscillation pulse signal produced by an oscillator (54) to the DC output to boost the DC output and a step of inputting a CPU pulse signal produced by a central processing unit (55a) to the DC output to boost the DC output are executed.<br><br>

[0019]<br>
The starter switch 12 includes a first fixed contact 66 connected to the starter relay 43, a second<br>
14<br><br>
fixed contact 67 connected to the main switch 13, and a movable contact 68 which can be connected to the first and second fixed contacts 66  and 67 or can be disconnected from the first and second fixed contacts 66 and 67. [0020]<br>

which can be connected to or disconnected from the fixed contact 71 and is connected to the battery 21 and the AC<br>

The antitheft switch section 73 is connected to an<br>
antitheft apparatus not shown, and exhibits an off state<br>
when the movable contact 72 of the main switch 13 is<br>
connected to the fixed contact 71 (on state) but exhibits<br>
an on state when the movable contact 72 is disconnected<br>
from the fixed contact 71 {off state).<br>
[0021]<br>
The fuel pump 27 is formed from an electric motor<br>
74 and a pump body 75 driven by the electric motor 74. The AC generator 33 is of the three-phase AC<br>
generation type and includes stator coils 33a, from which<br>
an output is extracted.<br>
15<br><br>
[0022]<br>
The battery disconnection relay 42 includes a switch section 78 formed from a fixed contact 76 connected to the main fuse 41 and a movable contact 77 which can be connected to or disconnected from the fixed contact 76 and is connected to the starter relay 43, and a coil 81 for switching on or off the switch section 78. The switch section 78 exhibits an off state when the coil 81 is not energized. [0023J<br>
The starter relay 43 includes a switch section 85 having a first fixed contact 82 connected to the battery disconnection relay 42, a second fixed contact 83 connected to the battery 21, and a movable contact 84 which can be connected to or disconnected from the first and second fixed contacts 82 and 83, and a coil 86 for changing over the connection of the movable contact 84 to the first and second fixed contacts 82 and 83. The movable contact 84 is connected to the first fixed contact 82 when the coil 86 is not energized, but the movable contact 84 is connected to the second fixed contact 83 when the coil 86 is energized. [0024]<br>
The boost rectification circuit 44 is formed from<br>
16<br><br>
the FETs 45 to 50 described above, diodes 91 to 96 connected between the drain and the source of the FETs 45 to 50, respectively, and a capacitor 101 connected between output terminal sections 97 and 98. The diodes 91 to 96 form a three-phase full wave rectification circuit, and the FETs 45 to 50 form a switching circuit for a chopper operation. [0025]<br>
The FETs 45 to 50 and the FETs 62 to 64 are P channel MOS type FETs {Field Effect Transistor), in each of which the drain current which flows between the drain and the source is controlled by a gate voltage applied between the gate and the source. [0026]<br>
The FET driving means 53 receives a pulse signal from the oscillator 54 or the computer 55, and supplies a driving signal sd of a rectangular waveform to the gates of the FETs 45 to 50 in synchronism with the frequency of the pulse signal. [00273<br>
The oscillator 54 activated when the voltage supplied from the battery 21 or the AC generator 33 reaches vl, and generates oscillation pulses having a predetermined amplitude, a predetermined pulse width and<br>
17<br><br>
a predetermined time interval, that is, the oscillator 54<br>
generates an oscillation pulse signal with the activation<br>
voltage vl or more,<br>
[0028]<br>
The computer 55 includes a central processing unit<br>
(CPU) 55a. The CPU 55a includes a clock generator not<br>
shown which generates periodical pulses of a fixed<br>
interval of time.<br>
[0029]<br>
The CPU 55a is activated when the voltage supplied<br>
from the battery 21 or the AC generator 33 reaches v2 and generates pulses (the pulses are hereinafter referred to as "CPU pulses") having a predetermined amplitude, a predetermined pulse width and a predetermined time interval based on a pulse signal of the clock generator, that is, the CPU 55a generates a CPU pulse signal with the activation voltage v2 or more.<br>
[0030]<br>
Further, while the CPU 55a generates the CPU pulse signal only for a predetermined time after the generation of the CPU pulse signal is started, if an ignition pulser signal from an ignition pulser signal generation apparatus not shown is detected within a predetermined time, then the generation of the CPU pulse signal is<br>
18<br><br>
continued until the engine speed reaches a predetermined value or more or the battery voltage reaches a predetermined value or more also after the predetermined time.  Then, when fc&amp;e engine speed becomes a fixed value or less or when rotation of the engine stops, the CPU 55a ends the generation of the CPU pulse signal. 10031]<br>
The first diode 56 allows current to flow only in a direction from the Dattery 21 to the main switch 13 side, but does not allow current to flow in the other direction from the AC generator 33 to the battery 21.<br>
The second diode 57 allows current to flow only in a direction from the AC generator 33 to the main switch 13 side, but does not allow current to flow in the other direction from the battery 21 to the AC generator 33. [0032]<br>
The general load 61 is an  electric load except a fuel supplying system load of the fuel pump 27 and so forth and an ignition system load of the CDI apparatus 16, the ignition plug 22 and so forth shown in FIG. 1. The general load 61 mainly includes lamp loads such as the head lamp 31, the tail lamp 32, a turn signal lamp, and instrument lights and so forth, and a horn. [0033]<br>
19<br><br>
Referring back to FIG, 3, diodes 103 to 105 are connected between the'drain and the source of the FETs 62 to 64, respectively.<br>
The control means 65 is started up with a predetermined voltage V which is supplied from the battery 21 or the AC generator 33 when the main switch 13 is switched on, and controls the gate voltage to the FETs 62 to 64 to effect switching on or off between the drain and the source of the FETs 62   to  64.<br>
Further, the control means 65 generates a control signal for activating the CDI apparatus 16 (refer to FIG. 1) [0034]<br>
The CDI apparatus 16 generates electricity with an ignition coil, rectifies the electricity by means of a diode, and temporarily stores it into a capacitor for ignition. Then, the CDI apparatus 16 switches a thyristor into an on state by applying an electric signal to the gate of the thyristor in an off state connected to the capacitor for ignition to discharge the power stored in the capacitor for ignition. The discharged current is supplied to the primary coil of the ignition coil to generate a high voltage in the secondary coil to generate a spark at the ignition plug.<br>
20<br><br>
[0035]<br>
Here, a generation voltage boosting apparatus 110 is composed of the boost rectification circuit 44, FET driving means 53, oscillator 54, and computer 55.<br>
Further, a power control apparatus 111 is composed of the FETs 62 to 64 and the control means 55. [0036]<br>
A generated voltage boosting method of the generation voltage boosting apparatus 110 is described below.<br>
FIG. 4 is an operation diagram illustrating the generated voltage boosting method by the generation voltage boosting apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
First, the main switch 13 is switched on. For example, if the amount of electricity of the battery 21 is so poor that the engine does not start even if the starter switch 12 is switched on, then the kick pedal 25 will be treadled down to start kicking.<br>
Consequently, the AC generator 33 is rotated to start generation. [0037]<br>
Then, the AC power generated by the AC generator 33 is three-phase full-wave rectified by the boost<br>
21<br><br>
rectification circuit 44, and a DC output is outputted between the output terminal sections 97 and 98.<br>
The voltage of the DC output is applied to the oscillator 54 and the computer 55 through the main switch 13. [0038]<br>
If the voltage is lower than the activation voltage vl of the oscillator 54, then the kick pedal will be successively treadled to continue the generation by the AC generator 33. Consequently, the engine speed, that is, the speed of rotation of the AC generator increases, and the generated voltage gradually rises. Then, when the generated voltage reaches the activation voltage vl of the oscillator 54 soon (whereupon the battery voltage is equal to vl), then the oscillator 54 starts generation of the oscillation pulse signal Pb. [00393<br>
As a result, the oscillation pulse signal Pb is applied to the FET driving means 53, and the PET driving means 53 provides activation signals Sd of rectangular waveforms of the same phase with a frequency higher than the AC output frequency of the AC generator 33 to the gates of the FETs 45 to 50.<br>
Consequently, since AC current of a high voltage is<br>
22<br><br>
generated in each of the stator coils 33a, and the AC current is full-wave rectified by the diodes 91 to 96 and smoothed by the capacitor 101.  In other words, a chopper operation is performed with the oscillation pulse signal Pb by the boost rectification circuit 44. [0040]<br>
Then, if the DC voltage obtained by the rectification and the smoothing reaches the activation voltage v2 of the CPU 55a higher than the activation voltage vl of the oscillator 54 (whereupon the battery voltage is equal to v2), then the CPU 55a sends a pulse stopping signal S-g  to the oscillator 54 to control the oscillator 54 to end the generation of the oscillation pulse signal Pb but starts generation of a CPU pulse signal Pc. As a result, the CPU pulse signal Pc is applied to the FET driving means 53, and the boost rectification circuit 44 performs a chopper operation again to further raise the output voltage between the output terminal sections 97 and 98. [0041]<br>
Then, if the output voltage between the output terminal sections 97 and 98 reaches a predetermined voltage v3 (whereupon the battery voltage is equal to v3) , then the CPU 55a stops the generation of the CPU pulse<br>
23<br><br>
signal Pc.<br>
When the output voltage becomes high in this manner, upon starting of the engine, a sufficiently high voltage can be supplied to the fuel pump 27 which is a fuel supplying system load and the control means 65 for activating the ignition system load, and the starting performance of the engine can be improved. [0042]<br>
The reason why the generation of the oscillation pulse signal Pb by the oscillator 54 is ended with the voltage v2 and the generation of the CPU pulse signal Pc by the CPU 55a is ended with the voltage v3 is that, for example, if it is assumed that vl - 3 V, v2 = 6 V, and v3 = 8 V, then the oscillator 54 operates with 3 to 6 v and the CPU operates 6 to 8 V most efficiently. [0043]<br>
FIG. 5 is a first graph illustrating the generated voltage boosting method according to the present invention in a case wherein the battery voltage VB upon starting of the engine (if the battery and the AC generator are connected to each other upon starting of the engine, then the battery voltage and the generated voltage of the AC generator are equal to each other) is 0 i VB 
24<br><br>
that the axis of ordinate of the graph represents the battery voltage VB (unit: V), the engine speed N {unit: rpm),   an ignition pulser signal, an oscillation pulse generation signal, and a CPU pulse generation signal, and the axis of abscissa represents the time (unit: msec).  It is represented that, when the oscillation pulse generation signal and the CPU pulse generation signal have the L level, the oscillator and the CPU do not generate the oscillation pulse signal and the CPU pulse signal, respectively, but when they have the H level, the oscillator generates the oscillation pulse signal and the CPU generates the CPU pulse signal.<br>
First, the main switch is switched on at time tl, and the kick pedal is treadled to start kicking at time t2. [0044]<br>
Consequently, the engine speed N rises gradually, and as the engine speed K rises, the battery voltage VB gradually becomes high due to generation of the AC generator.<br>
At time t3, the battery voltage reaches vl which is the activation voltage of the oscillator, and the oscillation pulse generation signal changes over from off (the L level) to on (the H level). In other words, the<br>
25<br><br>
oscillator starts generation of the oscillation pulse<br>
signal.<br>
[00453<br>
The generated voltage is boosted with the oscillation pulse signal, and the battery voltage VB charged with the generated voltage is further raised. When the battery voltage VB reaches VB = v2 which is the activation voltage of the CPU, the oscillation pulse generation signal changes over to off (the L level) and the CPU pulse generation signal changes over from off (the L level) to on (the H level) . In other words, the CPU causes the generation of the oscillation pulse signal to be ended and starts generation of the CPU pulse signal. [0046]<br>
At the point of time when the CPU pulse generation signal changes over to on, the timer is started, that is, the elapsed time begins to increase from t » 0. Then, if an ignition pulser signal is detected before the elapsed time becomes a predetermined time ts, then the CPU continues the generation of the CPU pulse signal also after the predetermined time ts. When the engine speed N reaches N «■ nl (for example, 1,600 rpm) at time t7 after the engine starts at time tfi, the CPU ends the generation of the CPU pulse signal. Here, if the battery voltage VB<br>
26<br><br>
reaches VB = v3 before the engine speed N reaches N = nl, then at this point of time, the CPU ends the generation of the CPU pulse signal. [0047]<br>
FIG. 5 is a second graph illustrating the generated voltage boosting method according to the present invention in another case wherein the battery voltage VB<br>
upon starting of the engine is vl S VB 
First, if the main switch is switched on at time tl, then since the battery voltage VB is higher than vl which is the activation voltage of the oscillator, the oscillator starts generation of the oscillation pulse signal simultaneously with the switching on of the main switch.<br>
Thereafter, the kick pedal is treadled to start kicking at time t2. 10048]<br>
Consequently, the engine speed N rises gradually, and as the engine speed N rises, the battery voltage VB gradually rises due to generation of the AC generator.<br>
When the battery voltage VB reaches VB - v2 which<br>
27<br><br>
is the activation voltage of the CPU at time tlO, the CPU controls the oscillator to end the generation of the oscillation pulse signal and begins generation of the CPU pulse signal. C0049]<br>
At the point of time when the generation of the CPU pulse signal is started, the timer is activated (the elapsed time t = 0} . Then, if the CPU detects an ignition pulser signal before the elapsed time t becomes the predetermined time ts, then the CPU continues the generation of the CPU pulse signal also after the predetermined time ts. When the battery voltage VB reaches VB = v3 at time tl2, the generation of the CPU pulse signal is ended. [0050]<br>
FIG. 7 is a third graph illustrating the generated voltage boosting method according to the present invention in a further case wherein the battery voltage VB upon starting of the engine is v2 5 VB 
First, if the main switch is switched on at time tl, then since the battery voltage VB is higher than vl which<br>
28<br><br>
is the activation voltage of the•oscillator, the oscillator begins generation of the oscillation pulse signal simultaneously with the switching on of the main switch. [0051]<br>
Further, since the battery voltage VB is higher than v2 which is the activation voltage of the CPU as well, the CPU controls the oscillator to end the generation of the oscillation pulse signal and starts generation of the CPU pulse signal after a predetermined time tb since starting of the oscillation pulse generation. Here, since the CPU does not detect an ignition pulser signal within the predetermined time ts, the generation of the CPU pulse signal is ended in the predetermined time ts. [0052]<br>
Thereafter, the kick pedal is treadled to start kicking at time t2 . If the CPU detects, an ignition pulser signal, then the CPU discriminates that the engine has started its rotation, and starts generation of the CPU pulse signal. [0053]<br>
Consequently, the engine speed N rises gradually, and as the engine speed-N rises, the battery voltage VB<br>
29<br><br>
gradually rises due to generation of the AC generator.<br>
When the battery voltage VB reaches VB * v3 at time tl8, the CPU ends the generation of the CPU pulse signal. [0054]<br>
FIG. S is a fourth graph illustrating the generated voltage boosting method according to the present invention in a still further case wherein the battery voltage VB upon starting of the engine is v2 = VB 
First, if the main switch is switched on at time tl, then since the battery voltage VB is higher than vl which is the activation voltage of the oscillator, the oscillator begins generation of the oscillation pulse signal simultaneously with the switching on of the main switch. [0055]<br>
Further, since the battery voltage VB is higher than v2 which is the activation voltage of the computer as well, the CPU controls the oscillator to end the generation of the oscillation pulse signal and starts generation of the CPU pulse signal after the predetermined time tb since starting of the oscillation<br>
30<br><br>
pulse generation. [0056]<br>
If the CPU detects an ignition pulser signal at time t22 within the predetermined time ts, then the CPO continues the generation of the CPU pulse signal also after the predetermined time ts. However, if the battery-voltage VB reaches v3 within the predetermined time ts, then the CPU ends the generation of the CPU pulse signal at the point of time when the predetermined time ts is reached. [0057]<br>
FIG. 9 is a fifth graph illustrating the generated voltage boosting method according to the present invention in a yet further case wherein the battery voltage VB upon starting of the engine is VB S v3 (for example, v3 » 8 V). It is to be noted that the axis of ordinate and the axis of abscissa of the graph are similar to those of FIG. 5.<br>
First, if the main switch is switched on at time tl, then since the battery voltage VB is higher than vl which is the activation voltage of the oscillator, the oscillator starts generation of the oscillation pulse signal simultaneously with the switching on of the main switch.<br>
31<br><br>
C0058]<br>
Further, since the battery voltage VB is higher than v2 which is the activation voltage of the CPU as well, the CPU controls the oscillator to end the generation of the oscillation pulse signal and starts generation of the CPU pulse signal in the predetermined time tb. Here, since the CPU does not detect an ignition pulser signal within the predetermined time ts, the generation of the CPU pulse signal is ended in the predetermined time ts. [00593<br>
Thereafter, the kick pedal is treadled to start kicking at time t2. The CPU detects from an ignition pulser signal that the engine has started its rotation. However, since the battery voltage VB is. VB i 8 V, the CPU does not generate the CPU pulse signal. [0060]<br>

As described above with reference to FIGS. 1, 4, 10 and 11, firstly, according to the present invention, the generated voltage boosting method for a generator wherein, in order to charge the battery 21 with a DC output and/or supply a DC output to an electric load, the AC generator 33 is driven by the engine 15 and an AC output generated by the AC generator 33 is rectified, and then chopper operation of converting the DC output obtained by the rectification once into AC current and boosting and rectifying the AC current is performed, is characterized in that, in the chopper operation, a step of inputting an oscillation pulse signal Fb produced by the oscillator 54 to the DC output to boost the DC output and a step of inputting a CPU pulse signal Pc produced by the CPU 55a to the DC output to boost the DC output are executed. [0074]<br>
Since the boosting with the oscillation pulse<br>
38<br><br>
*<br>
signal Pb of the oscillator 54 and the boosting with the CPU pulse signal Pc of the CPU 55a are performed, for example, when the generated voltage of the AC generator 33 is low upon starting of the engine, boosting is performed first by one of the oscillator 54 and the CPU 55a, and then boosting is performed by the other. [0075]<br>
Consequently, boosting can be performed efficiently within the boosting ranges individually of the oscillator 54 and the CPU 55a. Accordingly, upon starting of the engine, a sufficient voltage can be supplied to the fuel supplying system or the ignition system of the engine 15, and starting of the engine 15 can be performed in an early stage. [00763<br>
Secondly, according to the present invention, the generated voltage, boosting method for a generator is characterized in that the oscillator 54 can produce the oscillation pulse signal Pb with the activation voltage vl lower than the activation voltage v2 with which the CPU 55a can produce the CPU pulse signal Pc. [0077]<br>
Since boosting is performed in two steps such that, for example, when the generated voltage of the AC<br>
39<br><br>
generator 33 is low, the DC output is boosted with the oscillation pulse signal Pb produced by the oscillator 54, and then when the generated voltage becomes not less than the activation voltage v2 of the CPU 55a, the DC output is boosted with the CPU pulse signal Pc produced by the CPU 55a, upon starting of the engine, a sufficiently high voltage can be supplied to the fuel supplying system {the fuel pump 27 and so forth) of the engine 15 or the control means 65 for controlling the ignition system, and the starting performance of the engine 15 can be improved. [0078]<br>
Further, when starting of the engine 15 is performed by kicking the kick pedal 25, the generated<br>
voltage can be assured only by operating the kick pedal 25 with a weak operation force, and the kick starting can<br>
be performed readily. [0079]<br>
Thirdly, according to the present invention, the<br>
generated voltage boosting method for a generator is<br>
characterized in that the CPU 55a produces the CPU pulse<br>
signal Pc for a predetermined time ts after the<br>
activation voltage v2 thereof is reached.<br>
Where the CPU 55a produces the CPU pulse signal Pc<br>
for the predetermined time ts, the predetermined time ts<br>
40<br><br>
can be used, for example, as a waiting time for detecting<br>
an ignition pulser signal. If an ignition pulser signal<br>
is detected within the predetermined time ts, then also<br>
after the predetermined time ts, production of the CPU<br>
pulse signal Pc can be continued until the boosting with<br>
the CPU pulse signal Pc becomes required.<br>
i [0080]<br>
Fourthly, according to the present invention, the<br>
generated voltage boosting method for a generator is<br>
characterized in that the CPU starts production of the<br>
CPU pulse signal Pc when the CPU detects that the engine<br>
15 begins to rotate.<br>
Since the CPU pulse signal Pc is generated when the<br>
engine 15 begins to rotate, that is, when the AC<br>
generator 33 begins to generate power, the generated<br>
voltage can be boosted efficiently.<br>
[0081]<br>
Fifthly, according to the present invention, the<br>
generated voltage boosting method for a generator is<br>
characterized in that the CPU 55a stops the production of<br>
the CPU pulse signal Pc when the engine speed is not less<br>
than the predetermined value NH or the voltage of the<br>
battery 21 is not less than the predetermined value v3.<br>
Since the generated voltage is raised sufficiently<br>
41<br><br>
when the engine speed is not less than the predetermined value NH or the voltage of the battery 21 is not less than the predetermined value v3, useless power consumption can be suppressed by stopping the production of the CPU pulse signal Pc. [0082]<br>
It is to be noted that, while, in the embodiment described with reference to FIG. 8, the CPU pulse signal is generated only for the predetermined time ts, if the battery voltage VB becomes VB S v3, then even if the predetermined time ts does not elapse at the point of time, the generation of the CPU pulse signal may be ended.<br>
Further, while, in the embodiment described with reference to FIG. 9, generation of the oscillation pulse signal is continued for the predetermined time tb and generation of the CPU pulse signal is continued for the predetermined time ts, when the battery voltage VB is VB S v3, the generation of the oscillation pulse signal and the CPU pulse signal may not be performed. [0083] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effects due to the configuration described above.<br>
Since the generated voltage boosting method for a<br>
42<br><br>
i<br>
generator of claim 1 is configured such that, in a chopper operation, a step of inputting an oscillation pulse signal produced by an oscillator to the DC output to boost the DC output and a step of inputting a CPU pulse signal produced by a central processing unit to the DC output to boost the DC output are executed, for example, when the generated voltage of the generator is low upon starting of the engine, boosting can be performed first by one of the oscillator and the central processing unit, and then boosting can be performed by the other.  Consequently, boosting can be performed efficiently within the boosting ranges individually of the oscillator and the central processing unit. Accordingly, upon starting of the engine, a sufficient voltage can be supplied to the fuel supplying system or the ignition system of the engine, and starting of the engine can be performed in an early stage. [0084]<br>
Since the generated voltage boosting method for a generator of claim 2 is configured such that the oscillator can produce the oscillation pulse signal with an activation voltage lower than an activation voltage with which the central processing unit can produce the CPU pulse signal, by performing boosting in two steps<br>
43<br><br>
such that, for example, when the generated voltage of the generator is low, the DC output is boosted with the oscillation pulse signal produced by the oscillator, and then when the generated voltage becomes not less than the activation voltage of the central processing unit, the DC output is boosted with the CPU" pulse signal produced by the central processing unit, even if the generated voltage is low upon starting of the engine, a sufficiently high voltage can be supplied to the ignition system or the fuel supplying system of the engine, and the starting performance of the engine can be improved. [0085]<br>
Further, when starting of the engine is performed by a kick starting apparatus, the generated voltage can be assured only by operating the kick starting apparatus with a weak operation force, and the kick starting can be performed readily. [0086]<br>
Since the generated voltage boosting method for a generator of claim 3 is configured such that the central processing unit produces the CPU pulse signal for a predetermined time after an activation voltage thereof is reached, the predetermined time can be used, for example, as a waiting time for detecting an ignition pulser signal.<br>
44<br><br>
If an ignition pulser signal is detected within the predetermined time, then also after the predetermined time, production of the CPU pulse signal can be continued until the boosting with the CPU pulse signal becomes required. [0087]<br>
Since the generated voltage boosting method for a generator is configured such that the central processing unit starts production of the CPU pulse signal when the central processing unit detects that the engine begins to rotate, by generating the CPU pulse signal when the engine begins to rotate, that is, when the generator begins to generate power, the generated voltage can be boosted efficiently. [00883<br>
Since the generated voltage boosting method for a generator is configured such that the central processing unit stops the production of the CPU pulse signal when the speed of the engine is not less than a predetermined value or the voltage of the battery is not less than a predetermined value, the generated voltage is raised sufficiently when the engine speed is not less than the predetermined value or the voltage of the battery is not less than the predetermined value, and therefore, useless<br>
45<br><br>
power  consumption  can be  suppressed by  stopping  the production  of  the  CPU pulse  signal.<br>
