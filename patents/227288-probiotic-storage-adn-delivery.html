This invention relates to the storage and delivery of probiotic materials to<br>
selected sites in the gastrointestinal system.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that have a scientifically<br>
documented beneficial effect on human health. Probiotics are also used in animal<br>
feedstuffs either to improve animal health or productivity. They are used in pet<br>
foods, mainly to decrease unpleasant odours and improve consistency of faecal<br>
material.<br>
Most of the dominant global stains of commercial probiotic bacteria belong to the<br>
bifidobacteria and the lactobacilli. However, bacteria from other genera are used<br>
in some parts of the world. For example, China uses a number of other genera,<br>
including Bacillus and a Clostridium, Enterococcus faecium has also been used<br>
worldwide, however, this genus is implicated in transfer of antibiotic resistance. In<br>
the Western world, both bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have a strong track record<br>
as safe and acceptable genera to use as probiotics. Other examples are<br>
discussed in:<br>

Federation Bulletin No: 377: 10-19.<br>
It has beer widely recognized by researchers and medical investigations that<br>
most health effects are conferred by a scientific strain, and mostly not by the<br>
species in general. While many research groups have selected strains for useful<br>
probiotic properties, there is a dearth of information on performance in humans<br>
publised in peer-reviewed journals.<br><br>
Evidence is increasing that a probiotic food should contain selected strains of both<br>
lacrobacilli and bifidobacteria. The concept is that the probiotic lactoba'cilli are<br>
useful in the young (where the gut microflora of infants is already naturally rich in<br>
bifidobacteria), and that addition of probiotic bifidobacteria becomes more<br>
important in the elderly. The numbers of indigenous bifidobacteria decline with<br>
ageing if probiotics are not used. Bifidobacteria provide some protection against<br>
pathogens which are not able to be done effectively by lactobacilli alone.<br>
Adequate viable numbers of the strain of probiotic bacteria in the appropriate<br>
segment of the gut are essential if they are to be effective in an health sense. Most<br>
authorities consider 10 million bacteria per gram of food an appropriate dietary<br>
dose. Technically, this can be quite readily achieved. However, dose response<br>
curves have not been produced for any probiotic strain against any health<br>
condition.<br>
Losses of bacterial numbers occur during manufacture, freeze drying and during<br>
shelf life. However, further losses occur during transit through the gastro-intestinal<br>
tract The probiotic cultures will encounter gastric juices in the stomach ranging<br>
from pH 1.2 (on an empty stomach) through to pH 5.0 . The cultures will be<br>
present in the stomach from around 40 minutes up to 5 hours. They will also<br>
encounter in the stomach and the small intestine, bile salts, lipolytic, hydrolytic and<br>
proteolytic enzymes, which are also able to kill bacteria. It is not until the probiotic<br>
bacteria reach higher pH regions of the gastro-intestine that they are able to grow<br>
or survive. Such regions are the ileum and the bowel. During this transit, the<br>
bacteria also have to compete with resident bacteria or space and for nutrients.<br>
They also have to avoid being flushed out of the tract by normal peristaltic action,<br>
and they have to avoid being kilted by anti-microbials produced by other<br>
organisms. The bacteria have their most favourable growing conditions in the first<br>
third of the large bowel (the proximal bowel).<br>
Ability to adhere to surfaces, such as intestinal mucosal layer, and the epithelial<br>
cell walls of the gut are thus important characteristics for a probiotic. The term<br>
"colonisation" is used , and means that the bacteria has mechanisms which enable<br>
it to survive in a region of the gastro-intestine on an on-going basis. It is generally<br>
believed that the microflora of the gastro-intestine are relatively stable in adults,<br>
and are not easily altered by changes in the conditions in the gut ecosystem.<br><br>
Exceptions to this are administration of antibiotics, but even then the gut flora<br>
usually re-establish after sometime with a similar species composition.<br>
Mechanisms of Action of probiotic bacteria include:<br>
■	competitive exclusion (occupation of niches in the gut mucosal<br>
surface to prevent colonisation by infective species)<br>
■	production of acid conditions (lactic acid fermentation by the bacteria<br>
leading to lowered gut pH)<br>
■	effects on immune-mediated response<br>
■	reduction of putrefactive and genotoxic intestinal reactions (leading<br>
to lower pre-carcinogen levels)<br>
■	release of anti-microbials, such as bacteriocins<br>
Many diarrhoeal diseases originate from dysfunction in the small intestine, yet<br>
probiotic bacteria are not usually found in high numbers in that region, with the<br>
exception of some lactobacilli. There is iittle direct evidence available from healthy<br>
humans on microbial composition of the small intestine region. However, the<br>
effectiveness of probiotic bacteria in reducing diarrrtoeal disease is quite well<br>
established. They are either functioning in transit through the small intestine, or<br>
acting through an immune effect. Most immune reactions will occur in the mucosal<br>
walls of the small intestine and not the large bowel, thus, if immune-modulation is<br>
believed to be the mechanism of action, then the probiotic must be present in the<br>
small intestine. The other region of diarrhoea! disturbance is the large bowel.<br>
Probiotic bacteria can establish in that region quite easily.<br>
In addition to diarrhoeal disorders, probiotic bacteria are effective in lessening<br>
lactose intolerance, provided bacteria are chosen which have high beta<br>
galactosidase enzyme function. Lactose intolerance effects manifest in the bowel.<br>
There are a large number of other emerging health claims made for probiotics.<br>
These centre particularly around the bowel eg., bowel cancer, irritable bowel<br>
syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease).<br>
Accordingly , release of probiotic lactobacilli in the last half of the small intestine is<br>
preferred. Release of bifidobacteria is usually aimed to occur in the large bowel.<br>
Greater immune responses tend to occur with bifidobacteria than with lactobacilli,<br>
thus, there is an argument that bifidobacteria in the small intestinal regions are of<br>
great importance.<br><br>
Daily consumption of the probiotic is necessary if the target site is in the small<br>
intestine, as it is unlikely that the bacteria can adhere to the gut wall in sufficient<br>
numbers (except perhaps some lactobacilli). However, daily consumption maynot<br>
be necessary if the target site is the large bowel, as growth of the bacteria and<br>
colonisation may occur.<br>
Probiotic bacteria with good characteristics for effectiveness against disease and<br>
other conditions may not have good survival characteristics (eg resistance to low<br>
pH, bile salts, proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes, resistance to antibiotics,<br>
adherence to cell walls). Protection of the bacteria during transit to the target site<br>
is usually necessary.<br>
Protection may be achieved in several ways: encapsulation in a slow release<br>
pharmaceutical compound; encapsulation in a gum or in alginate; encapsulation in<br>
a resistant starch or in inulin in combination with a gum; protection by incorporation<br>
in a food containing resistant starch; or in a dairy food where the proteins and fats<br>
may provide some protection.<br>

be delivered to specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Brief description of the Invention<br>
To this end the present invention provides probiotic bacterial formulations in which<br>
one or more probiotic microorganisms are dispersed<br>
a)	in an aqueous suspension of a protein and a carbohydrate.<br>
b)	in an oil in water emulsion of a film forming protein and a<br>
carbohydrate and a fat, or<br>
c)	in an oil which is subsequently dispersed in a film forming protein<br>
and a carbohydrate<br>
The suspension, dispersion or emulsion may be dried to form a powder.<br>
Throughout this specification the term probiotic is intended to include<br>
microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi either individually or in combination<br>
which exhibit a beneficial effect on human health if delivered, preferably alive to<br>
the ta-get region of the gut. Examples include bifido bacteria, lactobacilli,<br>
saccharomyces, lactococci. streptococci, propionibacteria and any other<br>
microorganisms which may be demonstrated to have beneficial effects on the host.<br>
The probiotic may be mixed with a prebiotic material or be part of a symbiotic or<br>
synbiotic material.<br>
Throughout this specification the term prebiotic means a substance such as a<br>
protein, peptide, or carbohydrates that provide nutrients for the probiotic or assist<br>
the probiotic. For example lactoferrin can enhance the growth of desirable bacteria.<br>
Usually prebiotics cannot be digested in the upper intestinal tract. Prebiotic<br>
carbohydrates include resistant starch, potato starch or high amylose starch such<br>
as Starplus, modified starches (including carboxylated starches, acetylated,<br>
propionated, and butyrated starches), non-digestible oligosaccharides such as<br>
fructo-, giuco-, xylo-, soyabean-, galacto-, milk-, inulin-, arabinoxylans,<br>
arabinogalactans, galactomannans or digestion products of these, but not<br>
excluding other oligosaccharides able to exert prebiotic effects.<br><br>
Throughout this specification the term symbiotic or synbiotic means a combination<br>
of a probiotic and a prebiotic which together have a synergistic beneficial effect on<br>
human health.<br>
The probiotic bacteria may be introduced to the encapsulating medium as a liquid<br>
concentrate or in freeze dried form. The probiotic bacteria may be dispersed in oil<br>
and then emulsified with the aqueous suspension and then dried to produce an<br>
encapsulated oil carrying probiotic. This may also be dried to produce a powder.<br>
Any suitable drying technology such as spray drying, freeze drying or refractive<br>
windows drying may be used. Oil suspended probiotics may be preferred where<br>
the probiotic is moisture sensitive. The oil is preferably an edible oil and the<br>
emulsion or the powder obtained by drying the emulsion, may be used as a food<br>
ingredient, as well as in feed supplements.<br>
The aqueous suspension of the carbohydrate and the film forming protein or an<br>
emulsion of a film forming protein carbohydrate and oil mixture may be heated<br>
before the encapsulation step to react the saccharide and protein components. If<br>
the saccharide has reducing sugar groups the heating step will produce maillard<br>
reaction products. Heated aqueous suspensions are preferred when the probiotic<br>
is oxygen sensitive.<br>
The encapsulants of this invention form stable robust films or matrices which<br>
embed the probiotic or form films around the probiotic or the oil droplets.<br>
Any protein useful in encapsulating oils can be used as the protein component of<br>
this nvention. A carbohydrate is combined with the protein. In an aqueous<br>
suspension the protein need not be a film forming protein as it forms an<br>
encapsulating matrix about the probiotic. However with oil based systems a film<br>
forming protein is required.<br>
The protein is preferably soluble and is preferably stable in the heating range of<br>
the Maillard reaction and includes casein, soy and whey proteins, gelatine, egg<br>
albumin and hydrolysed proteins with increased free amino acid groups including<br>
soy protein hydrolysate. Care needs to be taken in reacting the protein and<br>
carbohydrate to ensure that the conditions do not result in gelling or coagulation of<br>
the protein, as this will render the protein incapable of forming an effective film.<br>
The preferred protein is a milk protein especially casein or whey protein isolate.<br>
Casein is a preferred protein in many applications because of its low cost and its<br><br>
greater resistance to gelling during any heat treatment eg: to form Maillard reaction<br>
products. For infant food applications whey proteins are the preferred protein<br>
source. The amount of Maillard reaction product in the protein-carbohydrate<br>
mixture is an amount sufficient to provide oxygen scavenging activity for the period<br>
of the product's shelf life. The minimum reaction required between the protein and<br>
carbohydrate prior to encapsulation will depend on the oxygen tolerance of the<br>
specific probiotic strain that is encapsulated. The extent of Maillard reaction<br>
product formed can be monitored, for a particular protein/carbohydrate<br>
combination, by the degree of colour change that occurs. An alternative measure<br>
is to assay the unreacted sugar.<br>
It is not essential that the carbohydrate and protein undergo a Maillard reaction to<br>
be an effective encapsulant for the probiotic bacteria. In mixing the protein and<br>
starch it has been found that microfluidisation of the materials particularly the<br>
carbohydrate enhances the effectiveness of the formulation.<br>
A preferred carbohydrate is a sugar with a reducing group preferably selected from<br>
the g'oup consisting of monosaccharides (eg: glucose, fructose), disaccharides<br>
(eg: maltose, lactose), trisaccharides, oligosaccharides and glucose syrups. Any<br>
reducing sugar source may be used including honey. Carbohydrates that do not<br>
undergo a Maillard reaction with the protein may also be used.<br>
It is within the ambit of this invention to use an oligosaccharide, or a starch<br>
including a resistant starch to improve the delivery and growth of the probiotic in<br>
the intestine and colon. Some of these materials are usually not digested in the<br>
upper intestinal tract and can assist in the growth of the probiotic.<br>

Materials<br>
Probiotic bacteria used in the examples are bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, however<br>
other strains of probiotic bacteria and blends can also be encapsulated by the<br>
same process.<br>
A probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 (Chr. Hansen, Denmark) and two strains<br>
of probiotic bifidobacteria with inherently different resiliencies to environmental<br>
conditions were used to investigate the advantages of the microencapsulation<br>
techniques. Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 (Chr. Hansen, Denmark) is a relatively<br>
robust probiotic strain with a relatively high resilience to environmental conditions<br>
including low pH, and a relatively high aerotolerance. Bifidobacterium infantis (Chr.<br>
Hansen, Denmark) is relatively sensitive to environmental conditions in<br>
comparison to Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12.<br>
Protein used in the examples is mainly casein, however the protein in the<br>
formulations can easily be substituted for other proteins such as whey protein, soy<br>
protein, hydrolysed proteins, etc.<br>
Carbohydrates used in the examples include glucose, oligosaccharides, dried<br>
glucose syrup, resistant starches and pre-processed starches. Other<br>
carbohydrates can be used in the formulations such as lactose, polysaccharides,<br>
maltodextrins, native starches, modified starches etc.<br>
Lipids (vegetable and animal oils, di- and tri-glycerides, n3- and n6 oils, etc.)<br><br>

ASSESSMENT OF BACTERIAL VIABILITY<br>
In order to enumerate viable bacteria, the probiotics were released from the<br>
microcapsules by dissolving the capsule material in Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF)<br>
(described later) or deionized water (D1). Duplicate 1.0 g samples of spray-dried<br>
encapsulated material were mixed with 10 ml of SIF or DI and the samples were<br>
incubated for 1 - 2 h at 37°C while continually mixed at 100 rpm. Enumeration of<br>
released viable bacteria was conducted using traditional microbiological plating<br>
methods. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the released bacteria were performed in 0.1%<br>
peptone (pH 6.9-7.0). To facilitate dispersion of the bacteria from oil in the samples<br>
Tween 30 (100µl) was added to the first dilution of all the samples before<br>
vortexing. Bifidobacteria were cultured on Reinforced Clostridial Agar (RCA) and<br>
the lactobacilli were grown on MRS (de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe) agar. The agar<br>
plates were incubated anaerobically for 48h at 37°C and CFU/g of encapsulated<br>
materia was determined. Percent survival was calculated as:<br>
Percent survival = (post-treatment CFU/g + initial CFU/g) x 100%<br><br>
The advantages of microencapsulation treatments on the survival of probiotic<br>
bacteria were examined in four areas:<br>
Survival during spray drying<br>
Survival (and release) during gastrointestinal transit<br>
Survival during non-refrigerated storage<br>
Survival at low pH<br>
Advantage of Microencapsulation During Spray Drying<br>
Each of the three probiotic bacterial strains mentioned previously was<br>
microencapsulated and spray dried using the techniques described in the<br>
examples. The percentage of the probiotic bacteria that survived spray drying was<br>
determined for each microencapsulation technique. For Bifidobacterium infantis, it<br>
was possible to spray dry a re-suspended freeze dried sample of bacteria to<br>
provide a comparison of the survival of encapsulated and re-suspended freeze-<br>
dried bacteria during spray drying.<br>
Figure 1 shows that all three microencapsulation strategies protected the probiotic<br>
during spray drying compared to non-encapsulated bacteria. ("Non-encapsulated"<br>
in Fig. 1 means the freeze dried probiotic sample was dispersed in water and<br>
spray dried)<br>
Microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the probiotic<br>
Bifidobacterium during spray drying.<br>
Strategy 1 appeared to be the best for Bifidobacterium infantis during spray drying.<br>
Greater than 3 orders of magnitude (3 log10 units) improvement in the viability of<br>
the probiotic was achieved with this sensitive strain.<br>
Figure 2 shows that the survival of Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 is generally much<br>
higher than for the sensitive Bifidobacterium infantis strain.<br>
A number of microencapsulation treatments enabled the viability of Bifidobacterium<br>
lactis E5b-12 to be retained within the same order of magnitude (less than 1 log10<br>
drop ir viability) during spray drying.<br>
Differences were observed between treatments within Strategy 3 in their ability to<br>
protect the viability of Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12.<br><br>
Since freeze-dried Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 re-suspended in water could not<br>
be spray dried, it was not possible to compare the effects of encapsulation during<br>
spray drying for this strain.<br>
Figure 3 shows that the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 was well<br>
maintained during spray drying for a number of encapsulation treatments.<br>
Many microencapsulation treatments allowed greater than 50% viability to be<br>
maintained during spray drying with strain-to-strain variation in the most effective<br>
treatments.<br>
Overall, Figure 1 shows that the encapsulation strategies used protect during<br>
spray drying, and Figures 2 and 3 show that the viability of Bifidobacterium lactis<br>
Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 remained largely intact following spray<br>
drying.<br>
Advantage of Microencapsulation During Gastrointestinal Transit<br>
To simulate survival during gastrointestinal transit, microencapsulated and non-<br>
microencapsulated probiotic bacteria were passed through a two-stage in vitro<br>
model simulating conditions in the stomach and small intestine. In stage 1,<br>
duplicate 1.0 g samples of each spray-dried encapsulated treatment were mixed in<br>
10 mL of Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with<br>
constant agitation at 100 rpm. After 2 hrs, the pH of the samples was adjusted to<br>
6.8 using 1 M sodium hydroxide (added drop wise to prevent possible damage to<br>
live ceils), then 10 ml of SIF was added to the pH-adjusted sample which was<br>
incubated for a further 3 h at 37°C with constant stirring at 100 rpm. Viable counts<br>
of the oacteria were then measured.<br>
The SGF and SIF were prepared as follows (Reference: US Pharmacopea (2000)<br>
&amp; National Formulatory (USP 24NF19, Rockville MD):<br>
Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF)(PH 1.2)<br>
Sodium chloride (1.0 g), 1.6 g of pepsin, and 3.5 ml of concentrated HCI (36%)<br>
were dissolved in deionized water to a final volume of 500 ml. The final pH of the<br>
solution was 1.2.<br><br>
Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF)(pH 6.8)<br>
Potassium hydrogen phosphate was prepared by dissolving 3.4g in 450 ml of<br>
deionised water. To this, 38.5 ml of 0.2 M sodium hydroxide and 6.25g of<br>
pancreatin (8xUSP grade) was added. The solution was mixed at 4°C overnight<br>
and the pH was adjusted to 6.8 with 1 M sodium hydroxide or with 0.2 M<br>
hydrochloric acid. The volume was made up to 500 ml with deionized water.<br>
Figure 4 shows that all three microencapsulation strategies improved the viability<br>
of the strain. ("Non-encapsulated (freeze dried)" means freeze dried probiotic<br>
sample in Figure 4 and all subsequent Figures)<br>
Microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the probiotic<br>
Bifidobacterium infantis compared to the non-encapsulated freeze dried bacteria.<br>
Strategies 2 and 3 were the most protective.<br>
Almost 100% survival of this sensitive probiotic strain was achieved with<br>
encapsulation compared to non-encapsulated bacteria for which viability dropped<br>
by almost 4 orders of magnitude (4 log10 units) under the same conditions.<br>
Advantage of Microencapsulation During Non-refrigerated Storage<br>
The survival of encapsulated and non-encapsulated probiotic bacteria was<br>
assessed during storage over a 5-week period at 25°C and 50% relative humidity.<br>
The survival of the bacteria was assessed after 2 weeks and 5 weeks. Viable<br>
counts were obtained as described previously.<br>
Figure 5 shows that all three microencapsulation strategies protected the viability<br>
of the strain to some extent after 2 weeks storage at 25°C-50% RH.<br>
Microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the probiotic Figure 4<br>
shows that all three microencapsulation strategies improved the viability of the<br>
strain. ("Non-encapsulated (freeze dried)" means freeze dried probiotic sample in<br>
Figure 4 and all subsequent Figures)<br>
Microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the probiotic<br>
Bifidobacterium infantis compared to the non-encapsulated freeze dried bacteria.<br>
compared to the non-encapsulated bacteria during non-refrigerated storage.<br>
Strategies 2 and 3 were the most protective.<br>
The viability of this probiotic strain, from a species that is sensitive to<br>
environmental conditions such as oxygen, was maintained within the same order<br><br>
of magnitude (less than 1 log10 unit drop) over a 2-week period in non-refrigerated<br>
conditions using some treatments.<br>
In contrast, the viability of non-encapsulated freeze dried bacteria was reduced by<br>
more than 5 orders of magnitude.<br>
Figure 6 shows that microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the<br>
probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis compared to the non-encapsulated bacteria<br>
during non-refrigerated storage. After 5 weeks of storage, the treatments<br>
encompassing Strategy 2 and encapsulation in protein-RS(MF) (Strategy 1) were<br>
the most successful at maintaining the viability of Bifidobacterium infantis.<br>
After storage at 25°C and 50% relative humidity for 5 weeks, microencapsulation<br>
of the bacteria using Strategy 2 enabled the loss in viable counts to be maintained<br>
at less than 2 log™ units, compared to a greater than 8 log™ unit drop in viable<br>
counts observed for non-encapsulated bacteria.<br>
Figure 7 shows that ail three microencapsulation strategies protected the viability<br>
of the strain during storage for 5 weeks at 25°C and 50% relative humidity to a<br>
greater degree than non-encapsulated bacteria.<br>
Microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the probiotic<br>
Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 compared to the non-encapsulated freeze dried<br>
bacteria during non-refrigerated storage. The viability of the non-encapsulated<br>
bacteria at 2 weeks storage was below the detection limit of 1000 CFU/g. The<br>
percent survival depicted for non-encapsulated freeze dried bacteria at this point<br>
therefore represents the maximum possible percent survival and may be an<br>
overestimate.<br>
The benefit in terms of percent survival after 5 weeks was between 2 and 4 log10<br>
units.<br>
Advantage of Microencapsulation in a Low pH Environment<br>
The ability of the microcapsules to protect the bacteria against moderately low pH<br>
was assessed using incubation at pH 4.0 as an example. Encapsulated spray<br>
dried and non-encapsulated freeze dried probiotic bacteria (0.12g freeze dried<br>
powder equivalent) were mixed in 10 mL of 0.2 M acetate buffer at pH 4.0 and<br>
incubated for 2 hrs at 37°C with constant stirring at 100 rpm. Following the 2h<br>
incubation, the pH of the samples was adjusted to 6.8 using 1 M sodium hydroxide<br>
and they were incubated for a further 1 h at 37°C (room temperature) to effect<br><br>
release of the bacteria from the capsules. The viable counts of bacteria in the<br>
samples were determined as described previously.<br>
Figure 8 shows that all three microencapsulation strategies protected the viability<br>
of the strain to some extent, providing on average a 2-3 log improvement in<br>
viability following incubation at pH 4.0. ("Non-encapsulated:freeze dried" is the<br>
freeze dried probiotic sample)<br>
Microencapsulation substantially protected the viability of the probiotic<br>
Bifidobacterium infantis compared to the non-encapsulated freeze dried bacteria.<br>
