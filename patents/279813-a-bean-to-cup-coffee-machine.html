BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
<br>
The following describes some non - limiting preferred embodiments of the machine in accordance with the present invention.<br>
<br>
As stated aforesaid, the coffee machines in vogue, did not have a high degree of<br>
consumer acceptability because of drawbacks in respect of utility, quality and price competitiveness and durability/re- usability.<br>
<br>
The Indian water conditions has frequent problems associated with boiler scaling<br>
thus reducing thermal efficiency of the machine<br>
The end product and the running of the machine was also not satisfactory , due to the operational constraints involved, in obtaining the desired mix of the drink opted for.<br>
<br>
The coffee machine in accordance with the present invention, aims at solving the<br>
above issues.<br>
<br>
The machine in accordance with the invention is popularly known as bean to cup machine.<br>
<br>
The bean to cup machine of the present invention comprises of an adjustable bean grinder, a steam boiler, a brewing unit and a control board. As shown in Figure 1 accompanying the Complete Specification, preferably the coffee machine of the present invention includes a hopper(1), a grinder(2), a boiler (3), a dispensing mechanism(4) a pump(5) and a brewing unit(6). That apart, it also includes a control board as illustrated in Figure 5 accompanying the Complete Specification.<br>
<br>
The components are integrated on a substrate made of durable material, such as ss304 grade steel, consisting of a base plate, central column, top plate and a powder coated side and back panels. The frame not only ensures hygiene condition but also trouble free service over years of use. The boiler as illustrated in Figure 4 accompanying the complete specification is a unique one, which enables descaling / cleaning of the boiler with ease repeatedly, even while using various quality of water available in Indian conditions.<br>
<br>
The adjustable bean grinder illustrated in Figure 2 accompanying the complete specification, can grind thp roasted coffee bean blends to the required fineness , without really over burning the already roasted beans which otherwise, affects its aroma or taste. The grinder unit may consist of the following: 1 .Ac motor running at constant speed.<br>
<br>
2.	Flat burr cutters made of high quality steel with helical profile to cut the bean without over pressing or over burning of the grind due to compression.<br>
<br>
3.	A device to adjust the distance between the two flat burr cutters to enable adjustment of the grind size.<br>
<br>
4.	A bean feed mechanism allowing a required quantity of bean to be fed per revolution.<br>
<br>
As shown in Figure 2, accompanying the Complete Specification, preferably, the various component of the grinder includes coupler(7), cutters(8), top bowl(9), bottom bowl(10), warm holder(11), warm adjuster(12), motor(13), bean guide(14), stud(15), mounting clamp(16), powder channel(17), screw(18), chute clamp, SS chute, 3 pin male connector, grinding mounting clamp, capacitor.<br>
<br>
The steam boiler illustrated in Figure 4, accompanying the complete specification, may be made from food grade SS 304 material having built in safety features like pressure gauges, pressure relief valves, safety valve. The boiler pressure inside is set to 1.4kgs. It has an inside seamless ss304 grade U tube for taking out of water required for coffee brewing. Steam required for warming or sucking the fresh milk is provided by this boiler. The boiler has a capacity to hold 3.5 liters of water under pressure and is fed fresh water through an imported high pressure constant.<br>
<br>
The brewing unit illustrated in Figure 3 accompanying the complete specification , meets the requirement to brew a very good coffee in the specified temperature and pressure. It consists of two actuators, which use rotary motion to be converted to linear motion and the freshly ground coffee powder is compressed and hot water is injected to get a rich and thick brewed coffee to the discerning taste of consumers. The various components of the brewing unit include actuators (1 and 2), piston wiper, supporting plate, nozzle, wiper motor cylinder. The movement of the actuators is controlled by switching on and off the relays and limiting current supply to the D.C. motors which are supplied with 8 volts D.C supply. To the ends of the actuators are pistons with micro fine SS filters through which the decoction is squeezed out. The brewing cylinder is also made of high quality food gradess304 material.<br>

The control board illustrated in Figure 5 accompanying the complete specification, is made from dual side PCB and solid state relays and switching options. The board is controlled from an 8 bit programmable microprocessor to incorporate any changes in sequences or timings, which may call for changes during development phases. The board controls both the Ac motors used for water pumping and as well as grinder apart from two DC motors used in actuators and DC motor for the wiper. The power supply to the PCB is through a step down transformer 18-0-18 VAC. AH the solenoid valves operating at 230 VAC are switched on or off from the PCB. An EMI filter is used at the input section of the circuitry to suppress all noises. The heater element inside the boiler is controlled through SSR which in turn, is controlled by PCB. The controlled circuit is also provided with MCB switches for emergency switching on/off functions apart from fuses for safety.<br>
<br>
The display of various .machine parameters and drink options is through a 16*1 sjngle line LCD display either with green, white or blue black back ground. The input to the machine is a dome sticker keypad.<br>
