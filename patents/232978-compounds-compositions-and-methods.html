FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to substituted urea derivatives,  particularly to<br>
compounds that selectively modulate the cardiac sarcomere, and specifically to compounds, pharmaceutical formulations and methods of treatment for systolic heart failure, including congestive heart failure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION THE CARDIAQ S&amp;RCOMERE<br>
[0003]	The "sarcomere" is an elegantly organized cellular structure found in<br>
cardiac and skeletal muscle made up of interdigitating thin and thick filaments; it comprises nearly 60% of cardiac cell volume. The thick filaments are composed of "myosin," the protein responsible for transducing chemical energy (ATP hydrolysis) into force and directed movement. Myosin and its functionally related cousins are called motor proteins. The thin filaments are composed of a complex of proteins. O neof these proteins, "actin" (a filamentous polymer) is the substrate upon which myosin pulls during force generation. Bound to actin are a set of regulatory proteins, the "troponin complex" and "tropomyosin," which make the actin-myosin interaction dependent on changes in intracellular Caz* levels. With each heartbeat, Ca2* levels rise and fall, initiating cardiac muscle contraction and then cardiac muscle relaxation (Robbins J and Leinwand LA. (1999) Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease, Chapter 8. editor Chien, K.R., W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia). Each of the components of the sarcomere contributes to its contractile response.<br>
[0004]	Myosin is the most extensively studied of all the motor proteins. Of the<br>
thirteen distinct classes of myosin in human cells, the myosin-ll class is responsible for contraction of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. This class of myosin is significantly different in amino acid composition and in overall structure from myosin in the other twelve distinct classes (Goodson HV and Spudich JA. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:659-663). Myosin-ll consists of two globular head domains linked together by a long alpha-helical coiled-coiled tail that assembles with other myosin-lls to form the core of the sarcomere's thick filament The globular heads have a catalytic domain where the actin binding and ATP functions of myosin take place. Once bound to an actin filament, the release of phosphate (cf. ATP to ADP) leads to a change in structural conformation of the catalytic domain that in turn alters the orientation of the light-chain binding lever arm domain that extends from the globular head; this movement is termed the powerstroke. This change in orientation of the myosin head in relationship to actin causes the thick filament of which it is a part to move with respect to the thin actin filament to which it is bound (Spudich JA. (2001) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2(5):387-92). Un-binding of the globular head from the actin filament (also Ca2+ modulated) coupled with return of the catalytic domain and light chain to their starting conformation/orientation completes the contraction and relaxation cycle.<br>
[0005]	Mammalian heart muscle consists of two forms of cardiac myosin, alpha<br>
and beta, and they are well characterized (Robbins, supra). The beta form is the predominant form (&gt; 90 percent) in adult human cardiac muscle. Both have been observed to be regulated in human heart failure conditions at both transcriptional and translational levels (Miyata supra), with the alpha form being down-regulated in heart failure.<br>
[0006]	The sequences of all of the human skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle<br>
myosins have been determined. While the cardiac alpha and beta myosins are very similar (93% identity), they are both considerably different from human smooth muscle (42% identity) and more closely related to skeletal myosins (80% identity). Conveniently, cardiac muscle myosins are incredibly conserved across mammalian species. For example, both alpha and beta cardiac myosins are &gt; 96% conserved between humans and rats, and the available 250-residue sequence of porcine cardiac beta myosin is 100% conserved with the corresponding human cardiac beta myosin<br>
sequence.   Such sequence conservation contributes to the predictability of studying myosin based therapeutics in animal based models of heart failure.<br>
[0007]	The components of the cardiac sarcomere present targets for the<br>
treatment of heart failure, for example by increasing contractility or facilitating complete relaxation to modulate systolic and diastolic function, respectively.<br>
HEART Fan<br>
[0008]	Congestive heart failure ("CHF") i s n ot a s pecific d isease, b ut rather a<br>
constellation of signs and symptoms, all of which are caused by an inability of the heart to adequately respond to exertion by increasing cardiac output. The dominant pathophysiology associated with CHF is systolic dysfunction, an impairment of cardiac contractility (with a consequent reduction in the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat). S ystolic d ysfunction w ith c ompensatory d ilation o f t he v entricular c avities results in the most common form of heart failure, "dilated cardiomyopathy," which is often considered to be one in the same as CHF. The counterpoint to systolic dysfunction is diastolic dysfunction, an impairment of the ability to fill the ventricles with blood, which can also result in heart failure even with preserved left ventricular function. Congestive heart failure is ultimately associated with improper function of the cardiac myocyte itself, involving a decrease in its ability to contract and relax.<br>
[0009]	Many of the same underlying conditions can give rise to systolic and/or<br>
diastolic dysfunction, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, viral infection, valvular dysfunction, and genetic disorders. Patients with these conditions typically present with the same classical symptoms: shortness of breath, edema and overwhelming fatigue. In approximately half of the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, the cause of their heart dysfunction is ischemic heart disease due to coronary atherosclerosis. These patients have had either a single myocardial infarction or multiple myocardial infarctions; here, the consequent scarring and remodeling results in the development of a dilated and hypocontractile heart. At times the causative agent cannot be identified, so the disease is referred to as Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy." Irrespective of ischemic or other origin, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy share an abysmal prognosis, excessive morbidity and high mortality.<br>
[0010]	The prevalence of CHF has grown to epidemic proportions as the<br>
population ages and as cardiologists have become more successful at reducing<br>
mortality from ischemic heart disease, the most common prelude to CHF. Roughly 4.6 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with CHF; the incidence of such diagnosis is approaching 10 per 1000 after 65 years of age. Hospitalization for CHF is usually the result of inadequate outpatient therapy. Hospital discharges for CHF rose from 377,000 (in 1979) to 957,000 (in 1997) making CHF the most common discharge diagnosis in people age 65 and over. The five-year mortality from CHF approaches 50% (Levy D. (2002) New Engl J Med. 347(1 8): 1442-4). Hence, while therapies for heart disease have greatly improved and life expectancies have extended over the last several years, new and better therapies continue to be sought, particularly for CHF.<br>
[0011]	"Acute" congestive heart failure, (also known as acute "decompensated"<br>
heart failure) involves a precipitous drop in heart function resulting from a variety of causes. For example in a patient who already has congestive heart failure, a new myocardial infarction, discontinuation of medications, and dietary indiscretions may all lead to accumulation of edema fluid and metabolic insufficiency even in the resting state. A therapeutic agent that increases heart function during such an acute episode could assist in relieving this metabolic insufficiency and speeding the removal of edema, facilitating the return to the more stable "compensated" congestive heart failure state. Patients with very advanced congestive heart failure particularly those at the end stage of the disease also could benefit from a therapeutic agent that increases heart function, for example, for stabilization while waiting for a heart transplant. Other potential benefits could be provided to patients coming off a bypass pump, for example, by administration of an agent that assists the stopped or slowed heart in resuming normal function. Patients who have diastolic dysfunction (insufficient relaxation of the heart muscle) could benefit from a therapeutic agent that modulates relaxation.<br>
ACTIVE AGENTS<br>
[0012]	Inotropes are drugs that increase the contractile ability of the heart. As a<br>
group, all current inotropes have failed to meet the gold standard for heart failure therapy, i.e., to prolong patient survival. In addition, current agents are poorly selective for cardiac tissue, in part leading to recognized adverse effects that limit their use. Despite this fact, intravenous inotropes continue to be widely used in acute heart failure (e.g., to allow for reinstitution of oral medications or to bridge patients to heart<br>
transplantation) whereas in chronic heart failure, orally given digoxin is used as an inotrope to relieve patient symptoms, improve the quality of life, and reduce hospital admissions.<br>
[0013]	Given the limitations of current agents, new approaches are needed to<br>
improve cardiac function in congestive heart failure. The most recently approved short-term intravenous agent, milrinone, is now nearly fifteen years old. The only available oral drug, digoxin, is over 200 hundred years old. There remains a great need for agents that exploit new mechanisms of action and may have better outcomes in terms of relief of symptoms, safety, and patient mortality, both short-term and long-term. New agents with an improved therapeutic index over current agents will provide a means to achieve these clinical outcomes.<br>
[0014]	The selectivity of agents directed at the cardiac sarcomere (for example,<br>
by targeting cardiac beta myosin) has been identified as an important means to achieve this improved therapeutic index. The present invention provides such agents (particularly sarcomere activating agents) and methods for their identification and use.<br>

[0028]	The term "optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described<br>
event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally substituted alky!" means either "alky!" or "substituted alkyl," as defined below. It will be understood by those skilled in the art with respect to any group containing one or more substituents that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns (e.g., substituted alkyl includes optionally substituted cycloalkyl groups, which in turn are defined as including optionally substituted alkyl groups, potentially ad infinitum) that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable.<br>
[0029]	"Alkyl" is intended to include linear, branched, or cyclic hydrocarbon<br>
structures and combinations thereof. Lower alkyl refers to alkyl groups of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, s-and t-butyl and the like. Preferred alkyl groups are those of CM or below. More preferred alkyl groups are those of Cis or below. Still more preferred alkyl groups are those of C6 and below. Cycloalkyl is a subset of alkyl and includes cyclic hydrocarbon<br>
groups of from 3 to 13 carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include c-propyl, c-<br>
butyl, c-pentyl, norbomyl, adamantyl and the like. In this application, alkyl refers to<br>
alkanyl, alkenyl and alkynyl residues; it is intended to include cydohexylmethyl, vinyl,<br>
allyl, isoprenyl and the like. Alkylene is another subset of alkyl, referring to the same<br>
residues as alkyl, but having two points of attachment. Examples of alkylene include<br>
ethylene (-CH2CH:r), propylene (-CH2CH2CH2-), dimethylpropylene (-CH2C(CH3) 2CH2-)<br>
and cyclohexylpropylene (-CH2CH2CH(C6Hi3)-). When an alkyl residue having a<br>
specific number of carbons is named, all geometric isomers having that number of<br>
carbons are intended to be encompassed; thus, for example, "butyl" is meant to include<br>
n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl; "propyl" includes n-propyl and isopropyl.<br>
[0030]	The term "alkoxy" or "alkoxyl" refers to the group -O-alkyl, preferably<br>
including from 1 to 8 carbon atoms of a straight, branched, cyclic configuration and<br>
combinations thereof attached to the parent structure through an oxygen. E xamples<br>
include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, cyclopropyloxy, cyclohexyloxy and the<br>
like. Lower-alkoxy refers to groups containing one to four carbons.<br>
[0031]	The term "substituted alkoxy" refers to the group -O-(substituted alkyl).<br>
One preferred substituted alkoxy group is "polyalkoxy" or -O-(optionally substituted alkylene)-(optionally substituted alkoxy), and includes groups such as -OCH2CH2OCH3, and glycol ethers such as polyethyleneglycol and -O(CH2CH2O)XCH3| where x is an integer of about 2-20, preferably about 2-10, and more preferably about 2-5. Another preferred substituted alkoxy group is hydroxyalkoxy or -OCH2(CH2)yOH, where y is an integer of about 1-10, preferably about 1-4.<br>
[0032]	"Acyl" refers to groups of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms of a straight,<br>
branched, cyclic configuration, saturated, unsaturated and aromatic and combinations thereof, attached to the parent structure through a carbonyl functionality. One or more carbons in the acyl residue may be replaced by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur as long as the point of attachment to the parent remains at the carbonyl. E xamples include a cetyl, benzoyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl and the like. "Lower-acyl" refers to groups containing one to four carbons and "acyloxy" refers to the group O-acyl.<br>
[0033]	The term "ammo" refers to the group -NH2. The term "substituted amino"<br>
refers to the g roup - NHR o r - NRR w here e ach R i s i ndependently s elected f rom the group: optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally substituted<br>
amino, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfanyl, sulfinyl and sulfonyl, e.g., diethylamino, methylsulfonylamino, furanyl-oxy-sulfonamino.<br>
[0034]	"Aryl" means a 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring, a bicyclic 9- or 10-<br>
membered aromatic ring system, or a tricyclic 12- to 14-membered aromatic ring system. Examples include cyclopenta-1,3-diene, phenyl, naphthyl, indane, tetraline, fluorene, cyclopenta[fc]naphthalene and anthracene.<br>
[0035]	"Aralkoxy" refers to the group -O-aralkyl.   Similarly, "heteroaralkoxy"<br>
refers to the group -O-heteroaralkyl; "aryloxy" refers to -O-aryl; and "heteroaryloxy" refers to the' group -O-heteroaryl.<br>
[0036]	"Aralkyl" refers to a residue in which an aryl moiety is attached to the<br>
parent structure via an alkyl residue. Examples include benzyl, phenethyl, phenylvinyl, phenylallyl and the like. "Heteroaralkyl" refers to a residue in which a heteroaryl moiety is attached to the parent structure via an alkyl residue. Examples include furanylmethyl, pyridinylmethyl, pyrimidinylethyl and the like.<br>
[0037]	"ATPase" refers to an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP. A TPases i nclude<br>
proteins comprising molecular motors such as the myosins.<br>
[0038]	"Halogen" or "halo"  refers to fluorine,  chlorine,  bromine or iodine.<br>
Fluorine, chlorine and bromine are preferred. Dihaloaryl, dihaloalkyl, trihaloaryl etc. refer to aryl and alkyl substituted with a plurality of halogens, but not necessarily a plurality of the same halogen; thus 4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl is within the scope of dihaloaryl.<br>
[0039]	"Heteroaryl" means a 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring containing 1-4<br>
heteroatoms, a bicyclic 8-, 9- or 10-membered aromatic ring system containing 1-4 (or<br>
more) heteroatoms, or a tricyclic 11- to 14-membered aromatic ring system containing<br>
1-4 (or more) heteroatoms; the heteroatoms are selected from O, N or S. Examples<br>

[0040]	"Heterocycle" or "heterocyclyl" refers to a cycloalkyl residue in which one<br>
to four of the carbons is replaced by a heteroatom such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur, a 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-membered non-aromatic ring containing 1-4 heteroatoms, a bicyclic 8-, 9-or 10-membered non-aromatic ring system containing 1-4 (or more) heteroatoms, or a<br>

Examples of substituted heterocyclyl include 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl and 4-benzyl-1-piperidinyl.<br>
[0041]	"Isomers" are different compounds that have  the same  molecular<br>
formula. "Stereoisomers" are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. "Enantiomers" are a pair of Stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.   A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a "racemic" mixture. The   term   n(.±.)"   is   used   to   designate   a   racemic   mixture   where   appropriate. "Diastereoisomers" are Stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog R-S system.    When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon may be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (-) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line.   Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-.  The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures.   Optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>

acceptable excipient"  includes  any and  all  solvents,  dispersion  media,  coatings,<br>
antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like.<br>
The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well<br>
known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible<br>
with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated.<br>
Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
[0043]	The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts that retain the<br>
biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of this invention and, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. I n many cases, the compounds of this invention are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like; particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, s ubstituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, specifically such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine.<br>
[0044]	The term "solvate" refers to a compound (e.g., a compound of Formula I<br>

SYNTHESIS OF THE COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA I<br>
[0066]	The compounds of the invention can be synthesized utilizing techniques<br>
well known in the art, e.g., as illustrated below with reference to the Reaction Schemes.<br>
SYNTHETIC REACTION PARAMETERS<br>
[0067]	Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein take<br>
place at atmospheric pressure, generally within a temperature range from -10°C to 110°C. Further, except as employed in the Examples or as otherwise specified, reaction times and conditions are intended to be approximate, e.g., taking place at about atmospheric pressure within a temperature range of about -10°C to about 110°C over a period of about 1 to about 24 hours; reactions left to run overnight average a period of about 16 hours.<br>
[0068]	The terms "solvent", "organic solvent" or "inert solvent" each mean a<br>
solvent inert under the conditions of the reaction being described in conjunction therewith [including, for example, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran ("THF"), dimethylformamide ("DMP), chloroform, methylene chloride (or dichloromethane), diethyl ether, methanol, pyridine and the like]. Unless specified to the contrary, the solvents used in the reactions of the present invention are inert organic solvents.<br>
[0069]	The term "q.s." means adding a quantity sufficient to achieve a stated<br>
function, e.g., to bring a solution to the desired volume (i.e., 100%).<br>
[0070]	Isolation and purification of the compounds and intermediates described<br>
herein can be effected, if desired, by any suitable separation or purification procedure such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography or thick-layer chromatography, or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations of suitable separation and isolation procedures can be had by reference to the examples hereinbelow. However, other equivalent separation or isolation procedures can, of course, also be used.<br>
[0071]	When desired, the (R)- and (S)-isomers may be resolved by methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which may be separated, for example, by cyrstallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed by separation of the modified and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. For example, a compound of Formula I can be dissolved in a lower alkanol and placed on a Chiralpak AD (205 x 20 mm) column (Chiral Technologies, Inc.) conditioned for 60 min at 70% EtOAc in Hexane. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into a nother c hemical e ntity byoneofthes eparation p rocedures d escribed a bove, a further step may be required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, a specific enantiomer may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active<br>
reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation.<br>

REACTION SCHEME 1<br>
(Figure Remove)  [0078]	Preparation of Compounds of Formula I	Referring to Reaction<br>
Scheme 1 , a flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser and thermal well, under nitrogen, is charged with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent (typically triphosgene) and a nonpolar, aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran. A solution of a compound of Formula 101 in a nonpolar, aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over about 10-60 minutes and the solution is allowed to stir between 1 to 1 5 hr. A compound of Formula<br>
103 is added portionwise, and the solution is stirred for about 10-60 min. A base, such as DIEA, is added dropwise for about one hour, and the solution is allowed to stir for about 1-15 hr. The product, a compound of Formula 105, is isolated and purified.<br>
Preparation of Compounds of Formula I	Reaction   Scheme  2<br>
illustrates an alternative synthesis of compounds of Formula I. The isocyanate of Formula 201 can be formed and isolated independently from either corresponding amine (i.e., R2-NH2) using phosgene or a phosgene equivalent or from the corresponding carboxylic acid (i.e., R2-COOH) using a Curtius or Hoffman rearrangement. A mixture of compounds of Formula 101 and 201 in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran from -40 °C to 110 °C is allowed to stir for between 1 to 15 hr. The product, a compound of Formula I, is isolated and purified.<br>
[0080]	Preparation of Formula 303   Referring to Reaction Scheme 3, Step 1a,<br>
a compound of Formula 301 a (where p and q are independently whole integers from 0<br>
to 2, and p+q = 1 to 4), is combined with about one equivalent of a compound of the<br>
formula R1-1-OH wherein R11 is as described above; a base such as potassium<br>
carbonate in an aprotic solvent such as DMF. The mixture is heated for about 1-16 hr at<br>
about 100°C. The product, a compound of Formula 303, is isolated and purified.<br>
[0081]	Alternatively, as in Scheme 3, Step 1b, a compound of Formula 301 b is<br>
combined a compound of the formula R1-1-OH wherein R3'1 is as described above; an azadicarboxylate such as diethyl azadicarboxylate or disopropyl azadicarboxylate and a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine in an aprotic solvent such as THF. The mixture is stirred about 1-16 hr at about room temperature. The product, a compound of Formula 303, is isolated and purified. Alternatively, as in Scheme 3, Step 1b, a compound of Formula 301 b is treated with a base such as sodium hydride in an aprotic solvent such as DMF for 1-16 hours from 0 °C to 110 °C. A compound of the formula R11-X wherein R1'1 is as described above and X is a leaving group such as a halogen, methanesulfonate, a p-toiuenesulfonate, or a triflouromethanesulfonate in an aprotic solvent such as DMF or THF for 1-16 hours from 0 °C to 110 °C. The product, a compound of Formula 303, is isolated and purified.<br>
[0082]	Preparation of Formula 305	Referring  to  Reaction  Scheme 3,<br>
Step 2, a Parr hydrogenation bomb is charged with 10% Pd/C under a nitrogen atmosphere, followed by a solution of a compound of Formula 303 in a polar, protic solvent such as ethanol. The reaction is stirred for about 24 hr under about 70 psi H2. The reaction mixture is filtered through celite and concentrated in vacuo to afford a compound of Formula 305, which can be carried forward to Formula I as illustrated with respect to Reaction Schemes 1 and 2.<br>
[0083]	Preparation of Specific Enantiomers of Formula I         As   discussed<br>
above, a specific enantiomer of Formula I can be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation. For example, (R)- and (S)-3-hydroxypiperidine are commercially available are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich, as are (R)- and (S)-hydroxypyrrolidine; they can also be resolved [e.g., using (6,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-adamantan-1-yl}-methane sulfonic acid, see: Ringdahl eta/.,<br><br>
J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 1981, 4, 697-8] and via other published methodology. Additional asymmetric synthetic approaches can be employed as illustrated in Reaction Schemes 4 and 5, in which PG represents an orthogonal protecting group (or a hydrogen, depending on the stage of synthesis, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art), LG represents a leaving group, and n is 1, 2 or 3. These protecting and leaving groups can be readily inserted and removed by those skilled in the art using commonly employed synthetic methodology.<br>
[0084]	Preparation of Formula 403	Referring  to Reaction  Scheme 4,<br>
Steps 1 and 2, a compound of Formula 401 is combined with about 1 equivalent of a protected amine of Formula 402 (such as benzyl amine) in a solvent such as dichloromethane or DMF. The reaction takes place at -20"C to 100°C over a period of 1 to 48 hours. The product, a compound of Formula 403, is isolated conventionally and then treated with a reducing agent (such as lithium aluminum hydride or borane) in an aprotic solvent such as THF. The reaction takes place at -20°C to 100°C over a period of 1 to 48 hours. The product, a compound of Formula 403, is then isolated conventionally, and can be carried forward to the compounds of Formula I, e.g., as described above.<br><br>

Step 1, a compound of Formula 501 is treated with a reducing agent (such as lithium aluminum hydride or lithium borohydride) in solvent such as THF. The reaction takes place at -20°C to 100°C over a period of 1 to 48 hours. The product, a compound of Formula 502, is isolated conventionally.<br>
[0086]	Preparation of Formula 503	Referring to  Reaction Scheme 5,<br>
Steps 2 and 3, a compound of formula 502 is stirred with an acylating agent, such as triflouroacetic anhydride in a solvent, such as THF from -78°C to 70°C for 1 to 12 hours. After addition of a base, such as triethylamine, the mixture is stirred at 20°C to reflux from 8 to 48 hours. The product, a compound of Formula 503. is isolated conventionally (see, e.g., US Patent No. 6,316,626) and can be carried forward to the compounds of Formula I, e.g., as described above.<br>
[0087]	Compounds prepared by the above-described process of the invention<br>
can be identified, e.g., by the presence of a detectable amount of Formula 101, 103, 201 or 305. While it is well known that Pharmaceuticals must meet pharmacopoeia standards before approval and/or marketing, and that synthetic reagents (such as the various substituted amines or alcohols) and precursors should not exceed the limits prescribed by pharmacopoeia standards, final compounds prepared by a process of the present invention may have minor, but detectable, amounts of such materials present, for example at levels in the range of 95% purity with no single impurity greater than 1%. These levels can be detected, e.g., by emission spectroscopy. It is important to monitor the purity of pharmaceutical compounds for the presence of such materials, which<br>
presence is additionally disclosed as a method of detecting use of a synthetic process of the invention.<br>

UTILITY, TESTING AND ADMINISTRATION UTILITY<br>
[00106]	The compounds of the present invention are selective for and modulate<br>
the cardiac sarcomere, and are useful to bind to and/or potentiate the activity of cardiac myosin, increasing the rate at which myosin hydrolyzes ATP. As used in this context, "modulate" means either increasing or decreasing myosin activity, whereas "potentiate" means to increase activity. It has also been determined in testing representative compounds of the invention, that their administration can also increase the contractile force in cardiac muscle fiber.<br>
[00107]	The  compounds,   pharmaceutical  formulations  and   methods  of the<br>
invention are used to treat heart disease, including but not limited to: acute (or decompensated) congestive heart failure, and chronic congestive heart failure; particularly diseases associated with systolic heart dysfunction. Additional therapeutic utilities include administration to stabilize heart function in patients awaiting a heart transplant, and to assist a stopped or slowed heart in resuming normal function following use of a bypass pump.<br>
TESTING<br>
[00108]	ATP hydrolysis is employed by myosin in the sarcomere to produce force.<br>
Therefore, an increase in ATP hydrolysis would correspond to an increase in the force<br>
or velocity of muscle contraction. In the presence of actin, myosin ATPase activity is stimulated &gt;100 fold. Thus, ATP hydrolysis not only measures myosin enzymatic activity but also its interaction with the actin filament. A compound that modulates the cardiac sarcomere can be identified by an increase or decrease in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by myosin, preferably exhibiting a 1.4 fold increase at concentrations less than 10 i^M (more preferably, less than 1 p,M). Preferred assays for such activity will employ myosin from a human source, although myosin from other organisms can also be used. Systems that model the regulatory role of calcium in myosin binding are also preferred.<br>
[00109]	Alternatively, a biochemically functional sarcomere preparation can be<br>
used to determine in vitro ATPase activity, for example, as described in U.S. Serial Number 09/539,164, filed March 29, 2000. The functional biochemical behavior of the sarcomere, including calcium sensitivity of ATPase hydrolysis, can be reconstituted by combining its purified individual components (particularly including its regulatory components and myosin). Another functional preparation is the in vitro motility assay. It can be performed by adding test compound to a myosin-bound slide and observing the velocity of actin filaments sliding over the myosin covered glass surface (Kron SJ. (1991) Methods Enzymol. 196:399-416).<br>
[00110]	The in vitro rate of ATP hydrolysis correlates to myosin potentiating<br>
activity, which can be determined by monitoring the production of either ADP or phosphate, for example as described in Serial No. 09/314,464, filed May 18,1999. ADP production can also be monitored by coupling the ADP production to NADH oxidation (using the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and monitoring the NADH level either by absorbance or fluorescence (Greengard, P., Nature 178 (Part 4534): 632-634 (1956); Mot Pharmacol 1970 Jan;6(1):31-40). Phosphate production can be monitored using purine nucleoside phosphorylase to couple phosphate production to the cleavage of a purine analog, which results in either a change in absorbance (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1992 Jun 1 ;89(11 ):4884-7) or fluorescence (Biochem J 1990 Mar 1 ;266(2):611-4). While a single measurement can be employed, it is preferred to take multiple measurements of the same sample at different times in order to determine the absolute rate of the protein activity; such measurements have higher specificity particularly in the presence of test compounds that have similar absorbance or fluorescence properties with those of the enzymatic readout.<br>
[00111]	Test compounds can be assayed in a highly parallel fashion using<br>
multiwell plates by placing the compounds either individually in wells or testing them in<br>
mixtures. Assay components including the target protein complex, coupling enzymes<br>
and substrates, and ATP can then be added to the wells and the absorbance or<br>
fluorescence of each well of the plate can be measured with a plate reader.<br>
[00112]	A preferred method uses a 384 well plate format and a 25 ^L reaction<br>
volume. A pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled enzyme system (Huang TG<br>
and Hackney DD. (1994) J Biol Chem 269(23): 16493-16501) is used to measure the<br>
rate of ATP hydrolysis in each well. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the assay<br>
components are added in buffers and reagents. Since the methods outlined herein<br>
allow kinetic measurements, incubation periods are optimized to give adequate<br>
detection signals over the background. The assay is done in real time giving the<br>
kinetics of ATP hydrolysis, which increases the signal to noise ratio of the assay.<br>
[00113]	Modulation of cardiac muscle fiber contractile force can be measured<br>
using detergent permeabilized cardiac fibers (also referred to as skinned cardiac fibers), for example, as described by Haikala H, et al (1995) J Cardiovasc Pharmacol 25(5):794-801. Skinned cardiac fibers retain their intrinsic sarcomeric organization, but do not retain all aspects of cellular calcium cycling, this model offers two advantages: first, the cellular membrane is not a barrier to compound penetration, and second, calcium concentration is controlled. Therefore, any increase in contractile force is a direct measure of the test compound's effect on sarcomeric proteins. Tension measurements are made by mounting one end of the muscle fiber to a stationary post and the other end to a transducer that can measure force. After stretching the fiber to remove slack, the force transducer records increased tension as the fiber begins to contract. This measurement is called the isometric tension, since the fiber is not allowed to shorten. Activation of the permeabilized muscle fiber is accomplished by placing it in a buffered calcium solution, followed by addition of test compound or .control. When tested in this manner, compounds of the invention caused an increase in force at calcium concentrations associated with physiologic contractile activity, but very little augmentation of force in relaxing buffer at low calcium concentrations or in the absence of calcium (the EGTA data point).<br>
[00114]	Selectivity for the  cardiac sarcomere  and   cardiac  myosin  can  be<br>
determined by substituting non-cardiac s arcomere components and myosin in one or<br>
more of the above-described assays and comparing the results obtained against those obtained using the cardiac equivalents.<br>
[00115]	A compound's ability to increase observed ATPase rate in an in vitro<br>
reconstituted sarcomere assay could result from the increased turnover rate of S1-myosin or, alternatively, increased sensitivity of a decorated actin filament to Ca**-activation. To distinguish between these two possible modes of action, the effect of the compound on ATPase activity of S1 with undecorated actin filaments is initially measured. If an increase of activity is observed, the compound's effect on the Ca-responsive regulatory apparatus could be disproved. A second, more sensitive assay, can be employed to identify compounds whose activating effect on S1-myosin is enhanced in the presence of a decorated actin (compared to pure actin filaments). In this second assay activities of cardiac-Si and skeletal-Si on cardiac and skeletal regulated actin filaments (in all 4 permutations) are compared. A compound that displays its effect on cardiac-Si/cardiac actin and cardiac-S1/skeletal actin, but not on skeletal-Si/skeletal actin and skeletal-Si/cardiac actin systems, can be confidently classified as cardiac-Si activator.<br>
[00116]	Initial evaluation of in vivo activity can be determined in cellular models of<br>
myocyte contractility, e.g., as described by Popping S, et al ((1996) Am. J. Physiol. 271: H357-H364) and Wolska BM, et al ((1996) Am. J. Physiol. 39:H24-H32). One advantage of the myocyte model is that the component systems that result in changes in contractility can be isolated and the major site(s) of action determined. Compounds with cellular activity (for example, selecting compounds having the following profile: &gt; 120% increase in fractional shortening over basal at 2 ^M, limited changes in diastolic length (
ADMINISTRATION<br>
[00117]	The compounds of Formula  I are administered at a therapeutically<br>
effective dosage, e.g., a dosage sufficient to provide treatment for the disease states<br>
previously described. While human dosage levels have yet to be optimized for the<br>
compounds of the invention, generally, a daily dose is from about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg of<br>
body weight, preferably about 0.10 to 10.0 mg/kg of body weight, and most preferably<br>
about 0.15 to 1.0 mg/kg of body weight. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the<br>
dosage range would be about 3.5 to 7000 mg per day, preferably about 7.0 to 700.0 mg<br>
per day, and most preferably about 10.0 to 100.0 mg per day. The amount of active<br>
compound administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject and disease state<br>
being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner and schedule of administration<br>
and the judgment of the prescribing physician; for example, a likely dose range for oral<br>
administration would be about 70 to 700 mg per day, whereas for intravenous<br>
administration a likely dose range would be about 700 to 7000 mg per day, the active<br>

acceptable salts thereof can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for<br>
agents that serve similar utilities including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously,<br>
intravenously, intranasally, topically, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly,<br>
intrapulmonarilly, vaginally, rectally, or intraoculariy. Oral and parenteral administration<br>
are customary in treating the indications that are the subject of the present invention.<br>
[00119]	Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions include solid, semi-solid, liquid<br>
and aerosol dosage forms, such as, e.g., tablets, capsules, powders, liquids, suspensions, suppositories, aerosols or the like. The compounds can also be administered in sustained or controlled release dosage forms, including depot injections, osmotic pumps, pills, transdermal (including electrotransport) patches, and the like, for prolonged and/or timed, pulsed administration at a predetermined rate. Preferably, the compositions are provided in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of a precise dose.<br>
[00120]	The compounds can be administered either alone or more typically in<br>
combination with a conventional pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or the like (e.g., mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, sodium crosscarmellose, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like). If desired, the pharmaceutical composition can also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, pH buffering agents and the like (e.g., sodium acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine<br>
derivatives, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and the like). Generally, depending on the intended mode of administration, the pharmaceutical formulation will contain about 0.005% to 95%, preferably about 0.5% to 50% by weight of a compound of the invention. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania.<br>
[00121]	In addition, the compounds of the invention can be co-administered with,<br>
and the pharmaceutical compositions can include, other medicinal agents,<br>
pharmaceutical agents, adjuvants, and the like. Suitable additional active agents<br>
include, for example: therapies that retard the p regression of h eart failure by d own-<br>
regulating neurohormonal stimulation of the heart and attempt to prevent cardiac<br>
remodeling (e.g., ACE inhibitors or p-blockers); therapies that improve cardiac function<br>
by stimulating cardiac contractility (e.g., positive inotropic agents, such as the p-<br>
adrenergic agonist dobutamine or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone); and<br>
therapies that reduce cardiac preload (e.g., diuretics, such as furosemide).<br>
[00122]	In one preferred embodiment, the compositions will take the form of a pill<br>
or tablet and thus the composition will contain, along with the active ingredient, a diluent<br>
such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, or the like; a lubricant such as<br>
magnesium stearate or the like; and a binder such as starch, gum acacia,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidine, gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives or the like. In another solid<br>
dosage form, a powder, marume, solution or suspension (e.g., in propylene carbonate,<br>
vegetable oils or triglycerides) is encapsulated in a gelatin capsule.<br>
[00123]	Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be<br>
'prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier (e.g., water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol or the like) to form a solution or suspension. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, as emulsions, or in solid forms suitable for dissolution or suspension in liquid prior to injection. The percentage of active compound contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject. However, percentages of active ingredient of 0.01% to 10% in solution are employable, and will be higher if the composition is a<br>
solid which will be subsequently diluted to the above percentages.    Preferably the •<br>
composition will comprise 0.2-2% of the active agent in solution.<br>
[00124]	Formulations of the active compound or a salt may also be administered<br>
to the respiratory tract as an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfme powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation have diameters of less than 50 microns, preferably less than 10 microns.<br>
Use IN SCREENING<br>
[00125]	Generally, to employ the compounds of the invention in a method of<br>
screening for myosin binding, myosin is bound to a support and a compound of the invention is added to the assay. Alternatively, the compound of the invention can be bound to the support and the myosin added. Classes of compounds among which novel binding agents may be sought include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, peptide analogs, etc. Of particular interest are screening assays for candidate agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays may be used for this purpose, including labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.

[00169]	Specificity assays: Compound specificity towards cardiac myosin is<br>
evaluated by comparing the effect of the compound on actin-stimulated ATPase of a panel of myosin isoforms: cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, at a single 50uM compound concentration.<br>
[00170]	Myofibril assays: To evaluate the effect of compounds on the ATPase<br>
activity of full-length cardiac myosin in the context of native sarcomere, skinned myoflbril assays are performed. Rat cardiac myofibrils are obtained by homogenizing rat cardiac tissue in the presence of detergent. Such treatment removes membranes and majority of soluble cytoplasmic proteins but leaves intact cardiac sarcomeric acto-myosin apparatus. Myofibril preparations retain the ability to hydrolyze ATP in an Ca++ controlled manner. ATPase activities of such myofibril preparations in the presence and absence of compounds are assayed at Ca** concentrations giving 50% and 100% of a maximal rate.<br>

[00171]	Dose responses are measured using a calcium-buffered, pyruvate kinase<br>
and lactate dehydrogenase-coupled ATPase assay containing the following reagents (concentrations expressed are final assay concentrations): Potassium PIPES (12 mM), MgCI2 (2 mM), ATP (1 mM), DTT (1 mM), BSA (0.1 mg/ml), NADH (0.5 mM), PEP (1.5 mM), pyruvate kinase (4 U/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (8 U/ml), and antifoam (90 ppm).

Calcium levels are controlled by a buffering system containing 0.6 mM EGTA and varying concentrations of calcium, to achieve a free calcium concentration of 1x10"* M to<br>
[00172]	The protein components specific to this assay are bovine cardiac myosin<br>
subfragment-1 (typically 0.5 |j.M), bovine cardiac actin (14 juM), bovine cardiac tropomyosin (typically 3 ^j.M), and bovine cardiac troponin (typically 3-8 ^M). The exact concentrations of tropomyosin and troponin a re d etermined e mpirically, by titration to<br>
achieve maximal difference in ATPase activity when measured in the presence of 1 mM EGTA versus that measured in the presence of 0.2 mM CaCI2. The exact concentration of myosin in the assay is also determined empirically, by titration to achieve a desired rate of ATP hydrolysis. This varies between protein preparations, due to variations in the fraction of active molecules in each preparation.<br>
[00173]	Compound dose  responses are typically measured at the calcium<br>
concentration corresponding to 50% of maximal ATPase activity (pCaso), so a preliminary experiment is performed to test the response of the ATPase activity to free calcium concentrations in the range of 1x10^ M to 1X10"8 M. Subsequently, the assay mixture is adjusted to the pCa5o (typically 3x10"7 M). Assays are performed by first preparing a dilution series of test compound, each with an assay mixture containing potassium Pipes, MgCI2, BSA, DTT, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, myosin subfragment-1, antifoam, EGTA, CaCl2, and water. The assay is started by adding an equal volume of solution containing potassium Pipes, MgCIa, BSA, DTT, ATP, NADH, PEP, actin, tropomyosin, troponin, antifoam, and water. ATP hydrolysis is monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. The resulting dose response curve is fit by the 4 parameter equation y = Bottom + ((Top-Bottom)/(1+((EC50/X)AHill))). The AC1.4 is defined as the concentration at which ATPase activity is 1.4-fold higher than the bottom of the dose curve.<br>

[00174]	20A. PREPARATION OF ADULT CARDIAC VENTRICULAR RAT MYQCYTF.^ Adult<br>
male Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane gas and oxygen. Hearts are quickly excised, rinsed and the ascending aorta cannulated. Continuous retrograde perfusion is initiated on the hearts at a perfusion pressure of 60 cm H20. Hearts are first perfused with a nominally Ca2+ free modified Krebs solution of the following composition: 110 mM NaCI, 2.6 mM KCL, 1.2 mM KH2PO4 7H20, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2.1 mM NaHCO3,11 mM glucose and 4 mM Hepes (all Sigma). This medium is not recirculated and is continually gassed with O2. After approximately 3 minutes the heart is perfused with modified Krebs buffer supplemented with 3.3% collagenase (169 (o/mg activity, Class II, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) and 25 jj,M final calcium concentration until the heart becomes sufficiently blanched and soft. The heart<br>
is removed from the cannulae, the atria and vessels discarded and the ventricles are cut<br>
into small pieces. The myocytes are dispersed by gentle agitation of the ventricular<br>
tissue in fresh collagenase containing Krebs prior to being gently forced through a 200<br>
^m nylon mesh in a 50 cc tube. The resulting myocytes are resuspended in modified<br>
Krebs solution containing 25 urn calcium. Myocytes are made calcium tolerant by<br>
addition of a calcium solution (100 mM stock) at 10 minute intervals until 100 ^M<br>
calcium is achieved. After 30 minutes the supernatant is discarded and 30 - 50 ml of<br>
Tyrode buffer (137 mM NaCL, 3.7 mM KCL, 0.5 mM MgCL, 11 mM glucose, 4 mM<br>
Hepes, and 1.2 mM CaCI2, pH 7.4) is added to cells. Cells are kept for 60 min at 37°C<br>
prior to initiating experiments and used within 5 hrs of isolation. Preparations of cells<br>
are used only if cells first passed QC criteria by responding to a standard (&gt;150% of<br>
basal) and isoproterenol (ISO; &gt; 250% of basal). Additionally, only cells whose basal<br>
contractility is between 3 and 8 % are used in the following experiments.<br>
[00175]	20B. ADULT VENTRICULAR MYOCYTE CONTRACTILITY EXPERIMENTS<br>
Aliquots of Tyrode buffer containing myocytes are placed in perfusion chambers (series<br>
20 RC-27NE; Warner Instruments) complete with heating platforms. Myocytes are<br>
allowed to attach, the chambers heated to 37°C, and the cells then perfused with 37°C<br>
Tyrode buffer. Myocytes are field stimulated at 1 Hz in with platinum electrodes (20%<br>
above threshold). Only cells that have clear striations, and are quiescent prior to pacing<br>
are used for contractility experiments. To determine basal contractility, myocytes are<br>
imaged through a 40x objective and using a variable frame rate (60-240 Hz) charge-<br>
coupled device camera, the images are digitized and displayed on a computer screen at<br>
a sampling speed of 240 Hz. [Frame grabber, myopacer, acquisition, and analysis<br>
software for cell contractility are available from lonOptix (Milton, MA).] After a minimum<br>
5 minute basal contractility period, test compounds (0.01 - 15 jiM) are perfused on the<br>
myocytes for 5 minutes. After this time, fresh Tyrode buffer is perfused to determine<br>
compound washout characteristics. Using edge detection strategy, contractility of the<br>
myocytes and contraction and relaxation velocities are continuously recorded.<br>
[00176]	20C. CONTRACTILITY ANALYSIS: Three or more individual myocytes<br>
are tested per compound, using two or more different myocyte preparations. For each cell, twenty or more contractility transients at basal (defined as 1 min prior to compound infusion) and after compound addition, are averaged and compared. These average transients are analyzed to determine changes in diastolic length, and using the<br>
lonwizard analysis program (lonOptix), fractional shortening (% decrease in the diastolic length), and maximum contraction and relaxation velocities (urn/sec) are determined. Analysis of individual cells are combined. Increase in fractional shortening over basal indicates potentiation of myocyte contractility.<br>

Fura-2 (Molecular Probes) is dissolved in equal amounts of pluronic (Mol Probes) and<br>
FBS for 10 min at RT. A 1 uM Fura stock solution is made in Tyrode buffer containing<br>
500 mM probenecid (Sigma). To load ceils, this solution is added to myocytes at RT.<br>
After 10 min. the buffer is removed, the cells washed with Tyrode containing probenecid<br>
and incubated at RT for 10 min. This wash and incubation is repeated. Simultaneous<br>
contractility and calcium measurements are determined within 40 min. of loading.<br>
[00178]	Imaging: A test compound is perfused on cells. Simultaneous<br>
contractility and calcium transient ratios are determined at baseline and after compound addition. Cells are digitally imaged and contractility determined as described above, using that a red filter in the light path to avoid interference with fluorescent calcium measurements. Acquisition, analysis software and hardware for calcium transient analysis are obtained from lonOptix. The instrumentation for fluorescence measurement includes a xenon arc lamp and a Hyperswitch dual excitation light source that alternates between 340 and 380 wavelengths at 100 Hz by a galvo-driven mirror. A liquid filled light guide delivers the dual excitation light to the microscope and the emission fluorescence is determined using a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The fluorescence system interface routes the PMT signal and the ratios are recorded using the lonWizard acquisition program.<br>
[00179]	Analysis:    For each cell, ten or more contractility and calcium ratio<br>
transients at basal and after compound addition, where averaged and compared. Contractility average transients are analyzed using the lonwizard analysis program to determine changes in diastolic length, and fractional shortening (% decrease in the diastolic length). The averaged calcium ratio transients are analyzed using the lonwizard analysis program to determine changes in diastoHc and systolic ratios and the 75% time to baseline (T7s).<br>
[00180]	2QE.  DURABILITY; To determine the durability of response, myocytes are<br>
challenged with a test compound for 25 minutes followed by a 2 min. washout period. Contractility response is compared at 5 and 25 min. following compound infusion.<br>
[00181]	20F. THRERHDI n POTENTIAL- Myocytes are field stimulated at a voltage<br>
approximately 20% above • threshold. In these experiments the threshold voltage<br>
(minimum voltage to pace cell) is empirically determined, the cell paced at that threshold<br>
and then the test compound is infused. After the compound activity is at steady state,<br>
the voltage is decreased for 20 seconds and then restarted. Alteration of ion channels<br>
corresponds to increasing or lowering the threshold action potential.<br>
[00182]	2QG. Hz FREQUENCY: Contractility of myocytes is determined at 3 Hz as<br>
follows: a 1 min. basal time point followed by perfusion of the test compound for 5 min.<br>
followed by a 2 min. washout. After the cell contractility has returned completely to<br>
baseline the Hz frequency is decreased to 1. After an initial acclimation period the cell<br>
is challenged by the same compound. As this species, rat, exhibits a negative force<br>
frequency at 1 Hz, at 3 Hz the FS of the cell should be lower, but the cell should still<br>
respond by increasing its fractional shortening in the presence of the compound.<br>
[00183]	207H ADDITIVE WITH ISOPROTERENQL: To demonstrate that a compound<br>
act via a different mechanism than the adrenergic stimulant isoproterenol, cells are loaded with fura-2 and simultaneous measurement of contractility and calcium ratios are determined. The myocytes are sequentially challenged with 5 urn a test compound, buffer, 2 nM isoproterenol, buffer, and a combination of a test compound and isoproterenol.<br>
Example 21 Ip vitro Modql of r&gt;ns«» Dppendqpt Cardiac Myosin ATPase Modulating<br>
[00184]	Bovine and rat cardiac myosins are purified from the respective cardiac<br>
tissues. Skeletal and smooth muscle myosins used in the specificity studies are purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and chicken gizzards, respectively. All myosins used in the assays are converted to a single-headed soluble form (S1) by a limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin. Other sarcomeric components: troponin complex, tropomyosin and actin are purified from bovine hearts (cardiac sarcomere) or chicken pectoral muscle (skeletal sarcomere).<br>
[00185]	Activity of myosins is monitored by measuring the rates of hydrolysis of<br>
ATP. Myosin ATPase is very significantly activated by actin filaments. ATP turnover is detected in a coupled enzymatic assay using pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In this assay each ADP produced as a result of ATP hydrolysis<br>
is recycled to ATP by PK with a simultaneous oxidation of NADH molecule by LDH. NADH oxidation can be conveniently monitored by decrease in absorbance at 340nm wavelength.<br>
[00186]	Dose responses are measured using a calcium-buffered, pyruvate kinase<br>
and lactate dehydrogenase-coupled ATPase assay containing the following reagents (concentrations expressed are final assay concentrations): Potassium PIPES (12 mM), MgCI2 (2 mM), ATP (1 mM), DTT (1 mM), BSA (0.1 mg/ml), NADH (0.5 mM), PEP (1.5 mM), pyruvate kinase (4 U/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (8 U/ml), and antifoam (90 ppm). The pH is adjusted to 6.80 at 22°C by addition of potassium hydroxide. Calcium levels are controlled by a buffering system containing 0.6 mM EGTA and varying concentrations of calcium, to achieve a free calcium concentration of IxlO"4 M to 1x1 O^M.<br>
[00187]	The protein components specific to this assay are bovine cardiac myosin<br>
subfragment-1 (typically 0.5 jj.M), bovine cardiac actin (14 ^M), bovine cardiac tropomyosin (typically 3 nM), and bovine cardiac troponin (typically 3-8 p.M). The exact concentrations of tropomyosin and troponin are determined empirically, by titration to achieve maximal difference in ATPase activity when measured in the presence of 1 mM EGTA versus that measured in the presence of 0.2 mM CaCI2. The exact concentration of myosin in the assay is also determined empirically, by titration to achieve a desired rate of ATP hydrolysis. This varies between protein preparations, due to variations in the fraction of active molecules in each preparation.<br>
[00188]	Compound  dose  responses are typically measured at the  calcium<br>
concentration corresponding to 50% of maximal ATPase activity (pCaeo), so a preliminary experiment is performed'to test the response of the ATPase activity to free calcium concentrations in the range of IxlO"4 M to IxlO"8 M. Subsequently, the assay mixture is adjusted to the pCaso (typically 3x10"7 M). Assays are performed by first preparing a dilution series of test compound, each with an assay mixture containing potassium Pipes, MgCI2, BSA, DTT, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, myosin subfragment-1, antifoam, EGTA, CaCI2, and water. The assay is started by adding an equal volume of solution containing potassium Pipes, MgCI2, BSA, DTT, ATP, NADH, PEP, actin, tropomyosin, troponin, antifoam, and water. ATP hydrolysis is monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. The resulting dose response curve is fit by the 4 parameter equation y = Bottom + ((Top-Bottom)/(1+((EC50/X)AHill))). The AC1.4 is defined as the<br>
concentration at which ATPase activity is 1.4-fold higher than the bottom of the dose curve.<br>
[00189]	Ability of a compound to activate cardiac myosin is evaluated by the<br>
effect of the compound on the actin stimulated ATPase of S1 subfragment. Actin filaments in the assay are decorated with troponin and tropomyosin and Ca++ concentration is adjusted to a value that would result in 50% of maximal activation. S1 ATPase is measured in the presence of a dilution series of the compound. Compound concentration required for 40% activation above the ATPase rate measured in the presence of control (equivalent volume of DMSO) is reported as AC4o-<br>

Once anesthetized, animals are shaven and hair remover is applied to remove all traces of fur from the chest area. The chest area is further prepped with 70% ETOH and ultrasound gel is applied. Using a GE System Vingmed ultrasound system (General Electric Medical Systems), a 10 MHz probe is placed on the chest wall and images are acquired in the short axis view at the level of the papillary muscles. 2-D M-mode images of the left ventricle are taken prior to, and after, compound bolus injection or infusion. In vivo fractional shortening ((end diastolic diameter - end systolic diameter)/ end diastolic diameter x 100) is determined by analysis of the M-mode images using the GE EchoPak software program.<br>
[00192]	22G. BOLUS AND INFUSION EFFICACY	For    bolus    and    infusion<br>
protocols, fractional shortening is determined using echocardiography as described above. For bolus and infusion protocols, five pre-dose M-Mode images are taken at 30<br><br>
second intervals prior to bolus injection or infusion of compounds. After injection, M-mode images are taken at 1 min and at five minute intervals thereafter up to 30 min. Bolus injection (0.5-5 mg/kg) or infusion is via a tail vein catheter. Infusion parameters are determined from pharmacokinetic profiles of the compounds. For infusion, animals received a 1 minute loading dose immediately followed by a 29 minute infusion dose via a tail vein catheter. The loading dose is calculated by determining the target concentration x the steady state volume of distribution. The maintenance dose concentration is determined by taking the target concentration x the clearance. Compounds are formulated in 25% cavitron vehicle for bolus and infusion protocols. Blood samples are taken to determine the plasma concentration of the compounds.<br>
Example 23<br>
HpntnHynamir.fi ip normal and heart failure animals<br>
[00193] . Animals are anesthetized with isoflurane, maintained within a surgical plane, and then shaven in preparation for catheterization. An incision is made in the neck region and the right carotid artery cleared and isolated. A 2 French Millar Micro-tip Pressure Catheter (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) is cannulated into the right carotid artery and threaded past the aorta and into the left ventricle. End diastolic pressure readings, max + / - dp/dt, systolic pressures and heart rate are determined continuously while compound or vehicle is infused. Measurements are recorded and analyzed using a PowerLab and the Chart 4 software program (ADInstruments, Mountain View, CA). Hemodynamics measurements are performed at a select infusion concentration. Blood samples are taken to determine the plasma concentration of the compounds.<br>
Example 24<br>

[00194]	24A. ANIMALS	Male Sprague-Dawley CD (220-225 g; Charles<br>
River) rats are used in this experiment. Animals are allowed free access to water and commercial rodent diet under standard laboratory conditions. Room temperature is maintained at 20-23°C and room illumination is on a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Animals are acclimatized to the laboratory environment 5 to 7 days prior to the study. The animals are fasted overnight prior to surgery.<br>
[00195]	94R  OCCLUSION PROCEDURE	Animals   are   anaesthetized<br>
with ketamine/xylazine (95 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) and intubated with a 14-16-gauge modified intravenous catheter. Anesthesia level is checked by toe pinch. Core body temperature is maintained at 37°C by using a heating blanket. The surgical area is clipped and scrubbed. The animal is placed in right lateral recumbency and initially placed on a ventilator with a peak inspiratory pressure of 10-15 cm HfeO and respiratory rate 60-110 breaths/min. 100% O2 is delivered to the animals by the ventilator. The surgical site is scrubbed with surgical scrub and alcohol. An incision is made over the rib cage at the 4th-5th intercostal space. The underlying muscles are dissected with care to avoid the lateral thoracic vein, to expose the intercostal muscles. The chest cavity is entered through ^-S"1 intercostal space, and the incision expanded to allow visualization of the heart. The pericardium is opened to expose the heart. A 6-0 silk suture with a taper needle is passed around the left coronary artery near its origin, which lies in contact with the left margin of the pulmonary cone, at about 1 mm from the insertion of the left auricular appendage. The left coronary artery is occluded by tying the suture around the artery ("LCO"). Sham animals are treated the same, except that the suture is not tied. The incision is closed in three layers. The rat is ventilated until able to ventilate on its own. The rats are extubated and allowed to recover on a heating pad. Animals receive buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/kg SO) for post operative analgesia. Once awake, they are returned to their cage. Animals are monitored daily for signs of infection or distress. Infected or moribund animals are euthanized. Animals are weighed once a week.<br>
[00196]	240. EFFICACY ANALYSIS	Approximately   eight   weeks   after<br>
infarction surgery, rats are scanned for signs of myocardial infarction using echocardiography. Only those animals with decreased fractional shortening compared to sham rats are utilized further in efficacy experiments. In all experiments, there are four groups, sham + vehicle, sham + compound, LCL + vehicle and LCL + compound. At 10 -12 weeks post LCL, rats are infused at a select infusion concentration. As before, five pre-dose M-Mode images are taken at 30 second intervals prior to infusion of compounds and M-mode images are taken at 30 second intervals up to 10 minutes and every minute or at five minute intervals thereafter. Fractional shortening is determined from the M-mode images. Comparisons between the pre-dose fractional shortening and compound treatment are performed by ANOVA and a post-hoc Student -<br>
Newman - Keuls. Animals are allowed to recover and within 7-10 days, animals are again infused with compounds using the hemodynamic protocol to determine hemodynamic changes of the compounds in heart failure animals. At the end to the infusion, rats are killed and the heart weights determined.<br>
