				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a new nonwoven fabric,<br>
the fabric being specifically suitable for use as<br>
contact surface with a user"s body in disposable<br>
absorbent products, surgical bandages, female hygienic<br>
tampons, powder or cleansing fabrics, and similar items.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
nonwoven fabric made from a network of interconnected<br>
staple fibers wherein the fibers include a mixture of at<br>
least two sets of staple fibers, each set having a<br>
length which is different than the other set by at least<br>
two millimeters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Medical and disposable absorbent products usually<br>
include a body-facing covering or lining material formed<br>
from a nonwoven fabric Typical nonwoven fabrics are<br>
derived from fibers or filaments which are chemically,<br>
hydraulically, thermally or mechanically linked together<br>
and made through technologies which are known to the<br>
expert such as, for example, "thermobonding",<br>
"spunbonding" or "through air bonding". Such fabrics<br>
must be comfortable, capable of remaining in contact<br>
with internal and external surfaces of the body for<br>
prolonged periods without causing itching or allergic<br>
J&amp;J-1672<br>
reactions and capable of transmitting body fluids to a<br>
central absorbent core. In an attempt to provide<br>
absorbent articles with covering or lining materials<br>
which remain clean and dry during their use, it is<br>
conventional to use synthetic fibers such as<br>
polypropylene, polyethylene, polyester and the like.<br>
Nonwoven fabric coverings of synthetic fibers of up<br>
to 3 denier have been used as coverings for personal<br>
disposable absorbent articles. These fabrics, though<br>
they possess great softness due to the fine denier of<br>
their fibers, tend to retain more liquids than desired<br>
due to the small capillary pore size provided by these<br>
fine denier fibers. Alternatively, an increase in fiber<br>
denier results in a decrease in fluid retention, but<br>
the softness of the fabric is decreased. Therefore, the<br>
search for an adequate technical solution still<br>
persists.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a nonwoven fabric which is useful as covering for<br>
personal absorbent articles for surfaces which are<br>
intended to contact a user"s body.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a nonwoven fabric which has a pleasant touch and<br>
marked softness and yet provides enhanced fluid<br>
absorbency capabilities.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide an absorbent article which uses a nonwoven<br>
fabric covering formed from at least two sets of staple,<br>
multi-length fibers, the length of one set being<br>
different than the other set by at least two<br>
millimeters.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide an absorbent article which uses a nonwoven<br>
fabric covering formed from at least two sets of staple,<br>
multi-length fibers and having fibers of more than one<br>
denier.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention<br>
shall be better understood in the detailed description<br>
below.<br>
In accordance with the present invention a new<br>
nonwoven fabric was created and characterized by a<br>
network of interconnected staple fibers formed by a<br>
mixture of at least two sets of staple fibers, each set<br>
of fibers having different average fiber lengths.<br>
Suitable fibers for use in this invention have a length<br>
of at least about 2 mm, and are generally in the range<br>
of from 2 mm to about 100 mm. The fibers of one set<br>
have an average fiber length which is greater than an<br>
average fiber length of a second set by at least 2 mm.<br>
As used herein, the terminology "fiber length" refers to<br>
an average length of one set of fibers. Accordingly,<br>
staple fibers having a length of 32 mm, for example,<br>
refer to a set of staple fibers having an average length<br>
of 32 mm, with a slight distribution of values around<br>
that number, usually with a normal statistic<br>
distribution. This distribution may range up to about<br>
+/- 20% of the average fiber length of the staple fibers<br>
in the set.<br>
As used herein, the terms "nonwoven" and "nonwoven<br>
fabric" are understood to be synonymous. Also as used<br>
herein, the terminology "mono-length" refers to a set of<br>
staple fibers with only one length. Also as used herein,<br>
the terminology "multi-length", refers to a blend of<br>
staple fibers having more than one measure of length.<br>
Also as used herein, the terminology "mono-denier"<br>
refers to a set of fibers or to a fabric containing<br>
fibers of only one denier. The terminology<br>
"multi-denier" refers to a fabric formed from a blend of<br>
two or more sets of fibers each set of fibers having a<br>
different denier value than the other set.<br>
The present invention provides a favorable relation<br>
between the number of fibers per volume of a nonwoven<br>
fabric and the feeling of the pleasant touch obtained,<br>
while maintaining its fluid absorbency performance. A<br>
larger number of fiber ends in a nonwoven fabric which<br>
contact a wearer of the fabric results in a greater<br>
feeling of softness. For a given nonwoven fabric<br>
produced by "n" quantity of staple fibers which have a<br>
length "x" is perceived by a wearer as being more<br>
pleasant to the touch than a nonwoven fabric produced by<br>
"n/2" quantity of staple fibers which have a length<br>
"2x". The invention finds an optimized balance between<br>
the fluid handling performance of a nonwoven fabric (for<br>
example, velocity of transmission of liquid in one<br>
direction, and the quantity of liquid returned in the<br>
opposite direction, capacity of masking, softness,<br>
flexibility, etc.) and the quantity of the number of<br>
fiber ends available to provide a pleasant touch.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the fibers of the<br>
present invention have lengths between 10 and 80 mm,<br>
each length being different at least 2 mm from the<br>
other. Preferably, the fibers have lengths between 15<br>
and 40 mm, each length differing at least 2 mm and<br>
preferably by at least 4 mm from the other.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the mixture of<br>
fibers of the present invention comprises between 2 and<br>
15 different lengths, and more preferably between 2 and<br>
6 different lengths.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, in each set of<br>
fibers from 50% to 99% of the fibers are within 1% of<br>
the average fiber length of the set with the balance of<br>
fibers in the set being within 20% of the average fiber<br>
length of the mixture. Thus, if the average fiber<br>
length for a given set of fibers is 10 mm, then from 50%<br>
to 99% of the fibers in the set are within 1% of this<br>
length, the balance of fibers in the set being within<br>
20% of this length. In a most preferred embodiment,<br>
from 80% to 90% of the fibers in the set are within 1%<br>
of the average fiber length, the balance of fibers in<br>
the set being within 10% of this length.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the nonwoven<br>
fabric is formed by a mixture of fibers having more than<br>
one denier, and more preferably, each set of staple<br>
fibers of specific length comprises at least two<br>
different denier, the values of which are preferably 2<br>
and 5.<br>
With reference to the denier of the fibers of the<br>
invention, fibers having a denier between 1 and 10 are<br>
suitable, preferably between 2 and 6. For one and same<br>
length of fiber, it is an advantage that between one and<br>
another different denier there might be a difference of<br>
at least one denier, preferably two denier. In an<br>
advantageous manner, all fibers having a single denier<br>
represent from 10% to 90% of the total amount of fibers<br>
of the mixture of fibers of the invention, preferably<br>
between more or less 30 to more or less 70%.<br>
The nonwoven fabrics of the present invention<br>
preferably have a basis weight between 25 grams to 50<br>
gsm, preferably in a range of from 30 gsm to 35 gsm and<br>
is most preferably 35 grams per square meter. The<br>
nonwoven fabrics of the present invention preferably<br>
have an apparent thickness between 0.15 and 0.40 mm. An<br>
additional benefit provided by the nonwoven fabric of<br>
the invention is that, for a given basis weight, the<br>
thickness of the fabric obtained from a mixture of<br>
multi-length fibers and multi-denier fibers is greater<br>
than that of a fabric formed with mono-length fibers and<br>
mono-denier, or of a fabric formed with single length<br>
fibers and multi-denier fibers, or of the product with<br>
multi-length fibers and mono-denier fibers. Such fabrics<br>
further provide the feeling of comfort and pleasant<br>
touch.<br>
The utilization of multi-denier, multi-length<br>
fibers perceptibly further increases the feeling of a<br>
pleasant touch. Further in accordance with the present<br>
invention, a new absorbent article is provided with a<br>
permeable covering for contact with the user"s body,<br>
comprising a nonwoven fabric formed by a network of<br>
interconnected multi-length thermoplastic fibers,, and<br>
the fibers possess a mixture or combination of at least<br>
two different lengths varying between 2 and 100 mm, and<br>
including a difference of at least 2 mm between<br>
themselves.<br>
Further in accordance with the present invention, a<br>
new feminine sanitary napkin is provided with a liquid<br>
permeable body-facing cover, a liquid impermeable<br>
garment-facing lining, and an absorbent core between the<br>
liquid permeable covering and the liquid impermeable<br>
lining, wherein the liquid permeable covering comprises<br>
a nonwoven fabric formed by a network of interconnected<br>
multi-length staple fibers, wherein the fibers possess a<br>
combination of at least two different lengths, varying<br>
between 2 and 100 mm, and comprising a difference<br>
between the two lengths of at least 2 mm.<br>
The absorbent articles of the present invention<br>
absorb body fluids and they are useful as disposable<br>
items such as, for example, diapers, feminine sanitary<br>
napkin, tampons, swaddling clothes, surgical bandages<br>
and cleansing fabrics. They may be used as separate<br>
articles or as necessary parts of disposable belongings<br>
or for limited use.<br>
Suitable fibers for use in the present invention<br>
include, but are not limited to any conventional staple<br>
synthetic fibers such as polymeric fibers including<br>
polypropylene, acetate, rayon, dynel, nylon, acrylic,<br>
Orion, Dacron, Vicara, polyester, polyethylene,<br>
polyacrylate and mixtures thereof, and are preferably<br>
polypropylene fibers.<br>
Further in accordance with the present invention is<br>
the utilization of bi-component fibers ("core-shell"),<br>
where the polymer of the core of the fiber is different<br>
from the polymer of the external layer of the fiber.<br>
Further in accordance with the present invention are the<br>
cross-section fibers which are different from the<br>
circular ones, for example, bilobal fibers, trilobal<br>
fibers, etc.<br>
The capacity for masking absorbed fluids by a<br>
nonwoven fabric, chiefly with reference to menstruation,<br>
is an important consideration in the development of<br>
covering materials for feminine sanitary napkin. It is<br>
much appreciated if such a covering has the ability of<br>
permitting a quick flow of the menstrual fluid towards<br>
the absorbent material, thus preventing the clear vivid<br>
sight of the fluid that has just been absorbed.<br>
Therefore, the fibers of the nonwoven fabric of the<br>
present invention are preferably provided with pigment<br>
material, preferably white colored, such as for example,<br>
titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Titanium dioxide is the preferred pigment<br>
material. The quantity of the pigment material in the<br>
fibers must be sufficient to provide the fibers with<br>
opacity, thus providing the nonwoven fabric with an<br>
enhanced ability to mask the absorbed fluids. The amount<br>
of titanium dioxide in the fibers is between 1 and 6 per<br>
cent in weight and is preferably between 2 and 3.5 per<br>
cent in weight.<br>
When the nonwoven fabric of the invention is used<br>
as a covering for a disposable absorbent article for<br>
contact with the user"s body, it is usually desirable<br>
that such covering have a durable hydrophilic finish so<br>
that the portion of the disposable absorbent article<br>
which is in contact with the user"s body remains<br>
hydrophilic after multiple introductions or passages of<br>
liquid. Hydrophilic finishes provide a better<br>
transportation of body fluid away from the user, and the<br>
body fluids are more efficiently taken towards the<br>
nearby absorbent core resulting in a cleaner, dryer<br>
feeling to the user. The fibers of the present invention<br>
may provided with a durable hydrophilic finish by<br>
treating the fibers with a surface active agent, such<br>
as, for example, a non-ionic surface active agent which<br>
is commercially available from ICI Polymer Additives,<br>
New Castle, Delaware, under the name "ATMER". Other<br>
adequate surface active agents, without excluding any<br>
other, are sodium salts of dioctylsulphosuccinate<br>
(commercially available from American Cyanamid under the<br>
name AEROSOL OT) , monolaurate of non-ionic<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitate (commercially available from<br>
ICI Polymer Additives, New Castle, Delaware under the<br>
name TWEEN 20), and similar products. The durable<br>
hydrophilic finish may be applied to the surface of<br>
fibers by immersing them in an aqueous solution of the<br>
desired surface active agent, or by spraying an aqueous<br>
solution of the desired surface active agent on the<br>
surface of the fibers and drying them subsequently.<br>
Alternatively, the surface active agent may be applied<br>
to the nonwoven fabric with the help of a cylinder which<br>
is previously wetted by an aqueous solution of the<br>
desired surface active agent for contacting the internal<br>
surface of the nonwoven fabric so that the opposite<br>
external surface might retain its original hydrophobic<br>
characteristic. Alternatively, internal hydrophilic<br>
surfactant active agents or wetting agents may be<br>
directly incorporated into the thermoplastic polymer<br>
during the manufacture of fibers. Suitable wetting<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, nonionic<br>
surfactants based on ethylene oxide/fatty alcohol ether,<br>
ethoxylates of propylene oxide with propylene glycol,<br>
fatty esters of sorbitol and glycerol, and other similar<br>
products. Any other agents and additives known to the<br>
expert which endow fibers, and consequently nonwoven<br>
fabrics as well, with specific properties may be used<br>
without interfering in the purpose of the invention.<br>
The nonwoven fabrics of the present invention may<br>
be formed by conventional processes including<br>
"thermobonding", "resin bonding" and "spunlacing". In<br>
all those manufacturing processes, the initial step is<br>
to form a veil of homogeneously mixed fibers. Generally,<br>
bundles of fiber sets, each set having different<br>
lengths, are mixed in an air mixing chamber and,<br>
subsequently, the fibers are either combed to form a<br>
combed veil or randomly placed on a perforated conveyor<br>
in order to form a continuous veil. When the thermal<br>
sealing process is used ("thermobonding"), the veil of<br>
fibers homogeneously mixed may be fed to a calendering<br>
station equipped with a heated smooth roller and a<br>
roller with relief standard that link the fibers and<br>
stabilizes the veil into a nonwoven fabric.<br>
In a chemical sealing process ("resin bonding), the<br>
veil of homogeneously mixed fibers is formed as<br>
described above and taken through a molding cylinder<br>
equipped with a series of water spray nozzles (for<br>
example, with a pressure around 2 00 psi), capable of<br>
causing a slight entanglement of the fibers. Then water<br>
is removed from the veil of entangled fibers by feeding<br>
it to a station where it is impregnated with a bonding<br>
material, being subsequently dried and hardened in a<br>
thermal transference equipment. Alternatively, the fiber<br>
veil may be submitted to powder resin spray, under<br>
vacuum and subsequently dried and hardened under forced<br>
air passage.<br>
Finally, in a "spunlace" process, the homogeneous<br>
mixture of fibers of different lengths passes through a<br>
series of high pressure water jets, for example, from<br>
500 to 1500 psi, so as to deeply entangle the fibers of<br>
the veil until a stabilized fabric is obtained. Then the<br>
water contained in the fabric is removed, and the fabric<br>
is dried.<br>
All the processes mentioned herein are well known<br>
to the expert and the choice of one or other process is<br>
not, per se critical to the invention, provided of<br>
course that the resulting nonwoven fabrics possess<br>
sufficient structural integrity so that the fabric is<br>
suitable for use as a covering material for absorbent<br>
articles. In general, a nonwoven fabric has sufficient<br>
structural integrity for use as a covering material for<br>
absorbent articles when the tensile strength reaches<br>
about one pound per inch. Sufficient structural<br>
integrity is generally obtained when the sealing area<br>
comprises between 10 and 40% of the total superficial<br>
area of the fabric, and the sealing area is preferably<br>
between 15 to 20% of the total superficial area of the<br>
fabric. It is preferable that the nonwoven fabric of the<br>
invention be a carded or combed mantle by the<br>
"thermobonding" process for hot sealing by making use of<br>
heated roll calender with relief standard.<br>
As is well known, absorbent articles which are<br>
externally used such as feminine sanitary napkins<br>
generally comprise a liquid impermeable garment-facing<br>
lining, a liquid absorbent core which is a layer of<br>
fiber absorbent material positioned on the lining, and a<br>
liquid permeable body-facing covering. Conventional<br>
covering materials include nonwoven fabrics formed by a<br>
network of oriented and interconnected fibers.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a novel<br>
feminine sanitary absorbent article has been provided<br>
with a liquid permeable covering which is turned towards<br>
the user"s body, a liquid impermeable lining which is in<br>
opposite direction to the permeable covering and turned<br>
towards the user"s clothes, and an absorbent core<br>
between the permeable covering and the impermeable<br>
lining, characterized in that the permeable covering<br>
comprises a nonwoven fabric formed by a network of<br>
interconnected multi-length staple fibers, preferably<br>
thermoplastic fibers, the fibers further comprising a<br>
mixture of at least two different sets of fibers, each<br>
set of fibers having different average lengths varying<br>
from 2 to 100 mm, and with a difference between the<br>
average fiber length of each set of at least 2 mm. The<br>
liquid permeable covering and the liquid impermeable<br>
lining are substantially co-extensive and are attached<br>
to each other along the periphery of the absorbent<br>
article through thermal fusion, adhesion, or any other<br>
convenient manner. The absorbent core is preferably<br>
adhesively attached to the impermeable lining by one or<br>
more glue lines.<br>
The liquid impermeable lining is on a garment-<br>
facing side of the absorbent article and may be made of<br>
any flexible material which is capable of preventing the<br>
flow of fluid therethrough. Suitable materials include<br>
polypropylene films, polyethylene films, polyester<br>
films, polyamide films, vinyl polyethylene-acetate<br>
films, polyvinyl chloride films, and polyvinylidene<br>
films. Laminated and co-extruded combinations of the<br>
films mentioned may also be used, when such combinations<br>
are possible, by taking into consideration the physical<br>
and chemical properties thereof. Non-reticulated films<br>
which are impermeable to fluids and papers lined with<br>
hydrophobic materials may also be used. Films which are<br>
barriers against fluids, though permitting the flow of<br>
gases, called "breathable films, may also be used such<br>
as, for example, polyurethane films and microporous<br>
films, where the microporosity is created by ionizing<br>
radiation or by leaching out soluble inclusions using<br>
aqueous or nonaqueous solvents. Fabrics having fluid<br>
repellant surfaces or having small pores due to the<br>
packing of fibers, or when the pore diameters have been<br>
reduced, may also be used, both individually and<br>
together with breathable films, or breathable barriers,<br>
A particularly preferred barrier film is an opaque film<br>
of polyolefin, such as, for example, polyethylene which<br>
is impermeable against body fluids and which is about 20<br>
microns thick. Polyester is another suitable lining<br>
material, such as for example, polyethylene<br>
terephthalate having a thickness of about 4 microns.<br>
The absorbent core may be a mass of defiberized<br>
pulp fibers having a relatively high absorption<br>
capacity. The absorbent core usually is rectangle shaped<br>
and it occasionally has lateral edges which are curved<br>
inwardly as in the form of an hour glass. The absorbent<br>
core is slightly smaller than the lining sheet and<br>
smaller than the nonwoven covering. The absorbent core<br>
also may be a fiber panel with a densified integral<br>
layer. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the<br>
absorbent core be positioned on the lining sheet of the<br>
absorbent article so that the densified layer might be<br>
attached to the lining. The densified layer has the<br>
capacity for absorbing and retaining the liquid which is<br>
relatively higher than the rest of the panel previously<br>
mentioned and it is usually formed by a slight<br>
moistening of one surface of the panel, and subsequently<br>
compressing the moistened surface. The absorbent<br>
article may optionally comprise an absorbent structure<br>
with multi-layers, which may possess, in addition to the<br>
absorbent core, a transfer layer, which is a low density<br>
layer for acceptance and distribution of fluid, usually<br>
located between the absorbent core and the covering<br>
sheet. The transfer layer may comprise materials and<br>
structures which are relatively less hydrophilic than<br>
the contents of the absorbent core, such as "meltblownV<br>
veils of polyester of polypropylene fibers. Such veils<br>
may further contain wood pulp within themselves.<br>
Transfer layers also may contain nonwoven veils of low<br>
density and high softness comprising wood fibers and<br>
synthetic fibers such as polyethylene, polypropylene;,<br>
polyester, polyacrylonitrile and polyamide. Such soft<br>
veils may be stabilized with chemical adhesives by<br>
thermal means such as "through air bonding".<br>
The thickness of the absorbent structure may be<br>
uniform along its whole surface, according to the<br>
requirements of specific conformability, flexibility and<br>
absorption, or alternatively it may be thicker in<br>
certain parts. For example, a profile of thickness<br>
particularly preferable is an absorbent structure which<br>
is thicker in the central part than in its peripheral<br>
parts.<br>
The fluid-impermeable barrier lining facing the<br>
user"s clothes may be stabilized or otherwise adhered to<br>
the surface of the absorbent structure, in all its<br>
length or in discrete sealing zones. The barrier lining<br>
which is turned towards the user"s clothes may be<br>
attached to the covering sheet in a super imposing<br>
configuration, for example, parallel to the sides of the<br>
absorbent structure, parallel to the bottom of the<br>
absorbent structure, or peripherally sealed by lateral<br>
extensions to the absorbent structure.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A practical example for carrying out a preferred<br>
alternative of the invention is given below, the only<br>
purpose of which is to illustrate and to give details<br>
about it, without creating any limitations, because<br>
other possible variations are presented to the expert<br>
about the subject, without impairing the purpose and th£<br>
meaning of the invention.<br>
Four types of nonwoven fabrics manufactured by the<br>
"thermobonding" process were evaluated, herein named A,<br>
B, C and D and their compared properties. The raw<br>
material was polypropylene homopolymer, containing 2.5%<br>
in weight of glittering titanium dioxide inserted during<br>
the fabrication of the fiber, and the density of fabrics;<br>
was 35g/m2.<br>
Table 1 below shows the distribution of the<br>
quantity of fibers per cm2 for each of the fabrics used<br>
in the test (numbers between brackets show the denier of<br>
the corresponding fiber).<br>

Total/cm2 330 196 393 157<br>
Note: The calculation for the number of fibers per<br>
square centimeter was determined by the formula:<br>
x = 0.9g/d c, where:<br>
x = number of fibers per square centimeter<br>
g = basis weight (grams per square meter)<br>
d = denier (grams/9000 meters) - (Note: value is<br>
averaged if there is more than one denier present).<br>
c = length of fiber (meters)<br>
EXPLANATION FOR THE COMPARISON<br>
Fabric A corresponds to a preferred performance of<br>
the invention, nonwoven multi-denier and multi-length<br>
fabric. Fabric B corresponds to a nonwoven multi-denier<br>
mono-length fabric. Fabric C is the reference fabric<br>
regarding the softness, comprising uniform length fibers<br>
of denier 2, while fabric D is the reference fabric<br>
regarding the low retention of liquid, comprising<br>
uniform length fibers of denier 5.<br>
Fabrics C and D demonstrate the difficulty of<br>
obtaining a nonwoven fabric of balanced properties. On<br>
one hand, the softest fabric commonly used in commercial<br>
products is fabric C, with a few disadvantages, for<br>
example, high retention of liquid. Fabric D, on the<br>
other hand, formed from larger denier fibers, eliminates<br>
the problem of high retention of liquid, but it is very<br>
rough.<br>
Table 2 below shows the results of various<br>
evaluations referring to fabrics A, B, C and D. The<br>
values expressed in each column indicate the relative<br>
performance among the four products tested by giving<br>
mark 1 to the worst performance and mark 4 to the best<br>
performance.<br>

CONCEPT OF PARAMETERS EVALUATED<br>
The concepts evaluated shall be explained by taking<br>
the example of a feminine sanitary napkin in which the<br>
nonwoven fabric, according to the invention, is the<br>
covering, namely, the material for contact with the<br>
user"s body.<br>
1. Retention of liquid<br>
This measure refers to the quantity of liquid<br>
retained in the fabric after going through it. The<br>
greater the retention of liquid (lowest mark) the<br>
greater the feeling of humidity transmitted to the<br>
user"s body. It is, therefore, a partial measure of the<br>
comfort propitiated by the contact with the user"s<br>
body.<br>
2. Fitting<br>
This measure refers to the conformability or adapt-<br>
ation of the fabric to the user"s body. For example, a<br>
"soft" fabric fits better to the body (highest mark)<br>
than a "hard" fabric. Additionally, the "hard" fabric is<br>
rougher than the "soft" fabric. This is another partial<br>
measure of the comfort offered to the user.<br>
3. Quantity of fibers ends per cm2.<br>
This measure refers to the feeling of pleasant<br>
touch caused by the contact of the ends of the fibers of<br>
the fabric on the skin, as previously explained. The<br>
larger the number of ends (highest mark) the more<br>
pleasant the feeling. This is another partial measure of<br>
the comfort offered to the user.<br>
4. Return of liquid<br>
This measure refers to the quantity of liquid which<br>
returns to the nonwoven fabric after going through the<br>
nonwoven fabric, lining the adjacent absorbent body. The<br>
smaller the return of liquid (highest mark) the smaller<br>
the feeling of humidity transmitted to the user, and,<br>
among other things, making the user sure that the<br>
product will not be leaking. This refers to another<br>
partial measure of the comfort offered to the user.<br>
5. Thickness<br>
Firstly, this measure refers to a "paper or<br>
cardboard" feeling that may occur for a certain relation<br>
between density/thickness. The greater the thickness<br>
(highest mark) the less of a "paper or cardboard"<br>
feeling transmitted to the user.<br>
Secondly, it also refers to the visual perception<br>
of being apart from the fluid absorbed by the adjacent<br>
absorbent core and the surface for contact with the<br>
body. That is to say, for the same quantity of titanium<br>
dioxide, the greater the thickness (highest mark) the<br>
more distant the absorbed blood seems to be from the<br>
surface. This is another partial measure of the comfort<br>
offered to the user.<br>
6. Softness<br>
Softness refers to a measure for the feeling of<br>
pleasure to the touch in a general way, without<br>
mentioning any other property of the product which is<br>
more specific. It is that feeling transmitted by<br>
handling a piece of nonwoven fabric. The better the<br>
feeling (highest mark) the pleasanter is the product. It<br>
is also a partial measure of the comfort offered to the<br>
user.<br>
ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED<br>
Nonwoven fabric A of the invention provided<br>
superior performance in all parameters evaluated and<br>
this fact makes it a superior product when compared with<br>
the conventional existing nonwoven fabrics because it<br>
does not have any disadvantage that could be harmful to<br>
its use.<br>
Fabric C- regarded here as the reference relating<br>
to softness,- is the worst one among the four types<br>
evaluated with reference to the retaining of liquid,<br>
return of liquid and apparent thickness.<br>
Fabric D,- regarded here as the reference relating<br>
to the low retaining of liquid,- is the worst one among<br>
the four types evaluated with reference to its fitting,<br>
number of ends and softness.<br>
Fabric B,- though comprising the same graduation<br>
scale of fabric C,- is successful in reducing the<br>
deficiencies of the latter and of fabric D, but the<br>
results thereof are still inferior to those of the<br>
nonwoven fabric of the invention.<br>
In summary, the average of values of non-woven<br>
fabric A of the invention, - obtained from the<br>
evaluation of sundry properties, - was the highest one<br>
among the four nonwoven -fabrics. Additionally, no<br>
parameter has indicated an entirely unfavorable<br>
performance (mark 1) in relation to the other ones.<br>
ANALYTICAL METHODS<br>
1. RETENTION OF LIQUID<br>
Principle of the method: a quantity of synthetic<br>
menstrual fluid is placed on a specific area on the<br>
surface of a pre-weighed nonwoven fabric, which rests on<br>
a block of absorbent material. After the flow of the<br>
fluid, the nonwoven fabric is removed and weighed -The<br>
difference between the final weight and the initial<br>
weight of the nonwoven fabric is considered as the<br>
retaining of liquid.<br>
Analytical Method Data:<br>
- synthetic menstrual fluid - formulation described in<br>
patent application WO1510996, page 37;<br>
- quantity of synthetic menstrual fluid - 7 ml;<br>
--specific area on the surface the nonwoven fabric; oval<br>
hole (3.9 by 2.5 cm) of an acrylic plate measuring 27 cm<br>
by 11 cm by 7.5 cm, (weight 276.4 g) , which rests on a<br>
nonwoven fabric during the test;<br>
- block of absorbent material: bleached pulp of long<br>
wood fibers, dimensions: 210 by 55 by 12 mm, density:<br>
0.0 6 g/cm3.<br>
- pouring out of synthetic menstrual fluid: quickly,in<br>
one stroke.<br>
- time elapsed between the beginning of pouring out of<br>
synthetic menstrual fluid and weighing of nonwoven<br>
fabric: 2 minutes.<br>
2. FITTING - standard test INDA 1ST 90.3-92<br>
(INDA)= "Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics<br>
Industry, United States of America).<br>
3. NUMBER OF ENDS - theoretically provided by double<br>
the number of fibers/cm2. In practice, a small quantity<br>
of ends may not be available because they are obstructed<br>
in the thermobonded areas.<br>
4. RETURN OF LIQUID<br>
Principle of the method: a quantity of synthetic<br>
menstrual fluid is placed on a specific area on the<br>
surface of a pre-weighed nonwoven fabrics which rests on<br>
a block of absorbent material. The wetted area is<br>
covered by an absorbent sponge, previously weighed, and<br>
placed under a specific pressure during a certain period<br>
of time. The fluid mass removed from the block of<br>
absorbent material by the absorbent sponge is considered<br>
as the return of liquid.<br>
The analytical method data are the same used in the<br>
method for the RETENTION OF LIQUID including:<br>
- absorbent sponge: Extra Absorbent Bandage measuring<br>
7.5 cm x 7.5 cm manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson<br>
Industrial e Commercio, Brazil.<br>
- Use of pressure - 5 minutes after the whole fluid has<br>
passed through the block of absorbent material, the same<br>
is placed on a hard and flat surface. Two sponges, which<br>
are folded four times, are placed on the wetted spot. A<br>
standard weight of 2.2 kg, and dimensions: 5.1 by 10.2<br>
by 5.4 cm, is placed on the sponges (resting on the<br>
surface measuring 5.1 cm by 10.2 cm) producing a<br>
pressure of approximately 4.14 kPa. The weight is<br>
removed after 3 minutes as well as the sponges which are<br>
immediately weighed. The difference of weight between<br>
the sponges before and after the absorption of synthetic<br>
menstrual fluid represents the return of liquid.<br>
5. THICKNESS - Standard test INDA 1ST 120.1-92<br>
6. SOFTNESS<br>
Softness is a subjective measurement that is<br>
assigned to samples by relative comparison. A fabric<br>
was cut into squares of approximately 10 by 10 cm of<br>
each of the four nonwoven fabrics tested. The samples<br>
were freely handled and the "feeling" relating to<br>
softness among the samples was determined.<br>
It is understood that the foregoing example refers<br>
only to performance illustrated as a specific example of<br>
the present invention, and is not to be construed as<br>
limiting the invention in any way except as provided in<br>
