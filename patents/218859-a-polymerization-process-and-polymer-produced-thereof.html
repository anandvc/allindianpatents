[0001]	This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application Nos.<br>
60/435,061, filed December 20, 2002, 60/464,187, filed April 21, 2003, and 60/479,081, filed June 17, 2003, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention provides for polymerization processes to produce<br>
polymers utilizing boiling pool reactor systems and diluents including hydrofluorocarbons.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Isoolefm polymers are prepared in carbocationic polymerization<br>
processes. Of special importance is butyl rubber which is a copolymer of isobutylene with a small amount of isoprene. Butyl rubber is made by low temperature catiomc polymerization that generally requires that the isobutylene have a purity of &gt;99.5 wt% and the isoprene have a purity of &gt;98.0 wt% to prepare high molecular weight butyl rubber.<br>
[0004]	The    carbocationic    polymerization    of   isobutylene    and    its<br>
copolymerization with comonomers like isoprene is mechanistically complex. See, e.g., Organic Chemistry, sixth EDITION, Morrison and Boyd, Prentice-Hall, 1084-1085, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 1992, and K. Matyjaszewski, ed, Cationic Polymerizations, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1996. The catalyst system is typically composed of two components: an initiator and a Lewis acid. Examples of Lewis acids include AlCb and BFj. Examples of initiators include Br0nsted acids such as HC1, RCOOH (wherein R is an alkyl group), and HjO.<br>
During the polymerization process, in what is generally referred to as the initiation step, isobutylene reacts with the Lewis acid/initiator pair to produce a carbenium ion. Following, additional monomer units add to the formed carbenium ion in what is generally called the propagation step. These steps typically take place in a diluent or solvent. Temperature, diluent polarity, and counterions affect the chemistry of propagation. Of these, the diluent is typically considered important.<br>
[0005]	Industry  has  generally  accepted  widespread  use  of a  slurry<br>
polymerization process (to produce butyl rubber, polyisobutylene, etc.) in the diluent methyl chloride. Typically, the polymerization process extensively uses methyl chloride at low temperatures, generally lower than -90Â°C, as the diluent for the reaction mixture. Methyl chloride is employed for a variety of reasons, including that it dissolves the monomers and aluminum chloride catalyst but not the polymer product. Methyl chloride also has suitable freezing and boiling points to permit, respectively, low temperature polymerization and effective separation from the polymer and unreacted monomers. The slurry polymerization process in methyl chloride offers a number of additional advantages in that a polymer concentration of approximately 26% to 37% by volume in the reaction mixture can be achieved, as opposed to the concentration of only about 8% to 12% in solution polymerization. An acceptable relatively low viscosity of the polymerization mass is obtained enabling the heat of polymerization to be removed more effectively by surface heat exchange. Slurry polymerization processes in methyl chloride are used in the production of high molecular weight polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene butyl rubber polymers. Likewise polymerizations of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene are also conducted using methyl chloride. Similarly, star-branched butyl rubber is also produced using methyl chloride.<br>
[0006]	However, there are a number of problems associated with the<br>
polymerization in methyl chloride, for example, the tendency of the polymer particles in the reactor to agglomerate with each other and to collect on the reactor wall, heat transfer surfaces, impeller(s), and the agitator(s)/pump(s). The rate of<br>
agglomeration increases rapidly as reaction temperature rises. Agglomerated particles tend to adhere to and grow and plate-out on all surfaces they contact, such as reactor discharge lines, as well as any heat transfer equipment being used to remove the exothermic heat of polymerization, which is critical since low temperature reaction conditions must be maintained.<br>
[0007]	The commercial reactors typically used to make these rubbers are<br>
well mixed vessels of greater than 10 to 30 liters in volume with a high circulation rate provided by a pump impeller. The polymerization and the pump both generate heat and, in order to keep the slurry cold, the reaction system needs to have the ability to remove the heat. An example of such a continuous flow stirred tank reactor ("CFSTR") is found in U.S. Patent No. 5,417,930, incorporated by reference, hereinafter referred to in general as a "reactor" or "butyl reactor". In these reactors, slurry is circulated through tubes of a heat exchanger by a pump, while boiling ethylene on the shell side provides cooling, the slurry temperature being determined by the boiling ethylene temperature, the required heat flux and the overall resistance to heat transfer. On the slurry side, the heat exchanger surfaces progressively accumulate polymer, inhibiting heat transfer, which would tend to cause the slurry temperature to rise. This often limits the practical slurry concentration that can be used in most reactors from 26 to 37 volume % relative to the total volume of the slurry, diluent, and unreacted monomers. The subject of polymer accumulation has been addressed in several patents (such as U.S. Patent No. 2,534,698, U.S. Patent No. 2,548,415, U.S. Patent No. 2,644,809). However, these patents have unsatisfactorily addressed the myriad of problems associated with polymer particle agglomeration for implementing a desired commercial process.<br>
10008]	U.S. Patent No. 2,534,698 discloses, inter alia, a polymerization<br>
process comprising the steps in combination of dispersing a mixture of isobutylene and a polyolefin having 4 to 14 carbon atoms per molecule, into a body of a fluorine substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon containing material without substantial solution therein, in the proportion of from one-half part to 10 parts of<br>
fluorine substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon having from one to five carbon atoms per molecule which is liquid at the polymerization temperature and polymerizing the dispersed mixture of isobutylene and polyolefin having four to fourteen carbon atoms per molecule at temperatures between -20Â°C and -164Â°C by the application thereto a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. However, '698 teaches that the suitable fluorocarbons would result in a biphasic system with the monomer, comonomer and catalyst being substantially insoluble in the fluorocarbon making their use difficult and unsatisfactory.<br>
[0009]	U.S. Patent No. 2,548,415 discloses, inter alia, a continuous<br>
polymerization process for the preparation of a copolymer, the steps comprising continuously delivering to a polymerization reactors a stream consisting of a major proportion of isobutylene and a minor proportion isoprene; diluting the mixture with from 1/2 volume to 10 volumes of ethylidene difluoride; copolymerizing the mixture of isobutylene isoprene by the continuous addition to the reaction mixture of a liquid stream of previously prepared polymerization catalyst consisting of boron trifluoride in solution in ethylidene difluoride,<br>
maintaining the temperature between -40Â°C and -103Â°C throughout the entire copolymerization reaction .... '415 teaches the use of boron trifluoride and its complexes as the Lewis acid catalyst and 1,1-difluoroethane as a preferred combination. This combination provides a system in which the catalyst, monomer and comonomer are all soluble and yet still affords a high degree of polymer insolubility to capture the benefits of reduced reactor fouling. However, boron trifluoride is not a preferred commercial catalyst for butyl polymers for a variety of reasons.<br>
[0010]	U.S. Patent No. 2,644,809   teaches, inter alia, a polymerization<br>
process comprising the steps in combination of mixing together a major proportion of a monoolefm having 4 to 8, inclusive, carbon atoms per molecule, with a minor proportion of a multiolefin having from 4 to 14, inclusive, carbon atoms per molecule, and polymerizing the resulting mixture with a dissolved Friedel-Crafts catalyst, in the presence of from 1 to 10 volumes (computed upon<br>
the mixed olefms) of a liquid selected from the group consisting of dichlorodifluoromethane, dichloromethane, trichloromonofluormethane, dichloromonofluormethane, dichlorotetrafluorethane, and mixtures thereof, the monoolefin and multiolefin being dissolved in said liquid, and carrying out the polymerization at a temperature between -20oC and the freezing point of the liquid. '809 discloses the utility of chlorofluorocarbons at maintaining ideal slurry characteristics and minimizing reactor fouling, but teaches the incorporation of diolefm (i.e. isoprene) by the addition of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). CFC's are known to be ozone-depleting chemicals. Governmental regulations, however, tightly controls the manufacture and distribution of CFC's making these materials unattractive for commercial operation.<br>
[0011]	Additionally, Thaler, W.A., Buckley, Sr., D.J., High Molecular-<br>
Weight, High Unsaturation Copolymers of Isobutylene and Conjugated Dienes, 49(4) Rubber Chemical Technology, 960 (1976), discloses, inter alia, the cationic slurry polymerization of copolymers of isobutylene with isoprene (butyl rubber) and with cyclopentadiene in heptane.<br>
[0012]	U.S. Patent No.  4,714,747  discloses,  inter alia,  a continuous<br>
process for the manufacture of butyl rubber by the polymerization of a monomer mixture comprising essentially at least 90% by weight of isobutene and 0.5 to 10% by weight (based on the weight of mixture) of at least one conjugated diene comonomer by continuously supplying a feed stream of the monomer mixture and halogenated hydrocarbon polymerization medium together with catalyst to an extruder type reactor and polymerizing therein, characterized by the steps of (a) cooling the feed stream of monomers and halogenated hydrocarbon polymerization medium to a polymerization temperature of -70Â°C. to +15Â°C. by vaporization of a portion thereof under reduced pressure; (b) supplying the cooled feed stream to a reactor which is a self-cleaning screw extruder and polymerizing therein under boiling plug- flow conditions at a constant pressure of 0.1 to 4 Bar using a "high" temperature aluminium halide catalyst and (c) removing, at the reactor outlet, polymer product at a concentration of at least 50% for recovery and<br>
a vaporized mixture of unreacted monomers and polymerization medium, for recycle, whereby no separate refrigerant is required.<br>
[0013]	WO 93/21241 discloses, inter alia, a continuous process for the<br>
production of high molecular weight isobutene-isoprene copolymers, containing from 0.5 to 10 wt% of combined isoprene, said process being characterized by the contemporary presence of the following critical characteristics in the various process sections: i) polymerization section characterized by the fact that the copolymer is formed, and is maintained during the polymerization course, as a suspension of particles in a liquid phase, said liquid phase being composed of monomers and methylchloride, at a temperature chosen in the range between -65 and +15Â°C, in the presence of polymerization catalysts obtained by combination of a least two components; the first of which being selected among aluminum trialkyls and aluminum dialkylmonohalides, and the second among halogens, interhalogenic compounds, alkyl- and arylhalides, said catalyst components being fed separately to the polymerization, the polymerization temperature being kept constant by boiling the liquid phase at a pressure between 0.1 and 4.0 bar, ii) discharge section of the polymer slurry from the polymerization section characterized by the fact that said polymer suspension (slurry) is conveyed and compressed upwards, squeezing the liquid phase downwards, so re-fluxing it to the polymerization section, iii) devolatilization section characterized by the fact the concentrated polymer slurry, obtained in the preceding point ii) is transformed into a solid rubbery polymer, free of volatiles, whereas the liquid phase contained in the slurry is vaporized and recovered by condensation.<br>
[0014]	Therefore, finding alternative diluents or blends of diluents to<br>
create new polymerization systems that would reduce particle agglomeration and/or reduce the amount of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methyl chloride is desirable. Such new polymerization systems would reduce particle agglomeration and reactor fouling without having to compromise process parameters, conditions, or components and/or without sacrificing productivity/throughput and/or the ability to produce high molecular weight polymers.<br>
[0015]	Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's) are chemicals that are currently used<br>
as environmentally friendly refrigerants because they have a very low (even zero) ozone depletion potential. Their low ozone depletion potential is thought to be related to the lack of chlorine. The HFC's also typically have low flammability particularly as compared to hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
[0016]	Background references also include WO 02/34794 that discloses a<br>
free radical polymerization process using hydrofluorocarbons. Other background references include DE 100 61 727 A, WO 02/096964, WO 00/04061, U.S. Patent No. 5,624,878, U.S. Patent No. 5,527,870, and U.S. Patent No. 3,470,143.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0049]	Various  specific  embodiments,  versions  and  examples of the<br>
invention will now be described, including preferred embodiments and definitions that are adopted herein for purposes of understanding the claimed invention. For determining infringement, the scope of the "invention" will refer to any one or more of the appended claims, including their equivalents, and elements or limitations that are equivalent to those that are recited.<br>
[0050]	For purposes of this invention and the claims thereto the term<br>
catalyst system refers to and includes any Lewis acid(s) or other .metal complex(es) as described herein used to catalyze the polymerization of the olefinic monomers of the invention, as well as at least one initiator, and optionally other minor catalyst component(s).<br>
[0051]	In  one  embodiment,  the  invention  provides  a  polymerization<br>
medium suitable to polymerize one or more monomer(s) to form a polymer, the polymerization medium comprising one or more Lewis acid(s), one or more initiator(s), and a diluent comprising one or more hydrofluorocarbon(s) (HFC's). In embodiments related to boiling pool reactor systems, the polymerization medium also comprises one or more monomer(s).<br>
[0052]	In another embodiment, the invention provides a polymerization<br>
medium suitable to polymerize one or more monomer(s) to form a polymer, the polymerization medium comprising one or more Lewis acid(s) and a diluent comprising one or more hydrofluorocarbon(s) (HFC); wherein the one or more Lewis acid(s) is not a compound represented by formula MXs, where M is a group 13 metal and X is a halogen. In embodiments related to boiling pool reactor systems, the polymerization medium also comprises one or more monomer(s).<br>
[0053]	The phrase "suitable to polymerize monomers to form a polymer"<br>
relates to the selection of polymerization conditions and components, well within the ability of those skilled in the art necessary to obtain the production of a desired polymer in light of process parameters and component properties described herein. There are numerous permutations of the polymerization process and variations in the polymerization components available to produce the desired polymer attributes. In preferred embodiments, such polymers include polyisobutylene homopolymers, isobutylene-isoprene (butyl rubber) copolymers, isobutylene and para-methylstyrene copolymers, and star-branched butyl rubber terpolymers.<br>
[0054]	Diluent   means   a   diluting   or   dissolving   agent.      Diluent   is<br>
specifically defined to include chemicals that can act as solvents for the Lewis Acid, other metal complexes, initiators, monomers or other additives. In the practice of the invention, the diluent does not alter the general nature of the components of the polymerization medium, i.e., the components of the catalyst system, monomers, etc. However, it is recognized that interactions between the<br>
diluent and reactants may occur. In preferred embodiments, the diluent does not react with the catalyst system components, monomers, etc. to any appreciable extent. Additionally, the term diluent includes mixtures of at least two or more diluents.<br>
[0055]	A reactor is any container(s) in which a chemical reaction occurs.<br>
[0056]	A boiling pool reactor system is any polymerization system that<br>
utilizes a reactor wherein the polymerization medium is evaporated during polymerization.<br>
[0057]	Slurry refers to a volume of diluent comprising monomers that<br>
have precipitated from the diluent, monomers, Lewis acid, and initiator. The slurry concentration is the volume percent of the partially or completely precipitated polymers based on the total volume of the slurry.<br>
[0058]	As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table<br>
Groups are used as in chemical and engineering news, 63(5), 27 (1985).<br>
[0059]	Polymer may be used to refer to homopolymers, copolymers,<br>
interpolymers, terpolymers, etc. Likewise, a copolymer may refer to a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
[0060]	When a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the<br>
monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the monomer or in the derivative form the monomer. Likewise, when catalyst components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it is well understood by one skilled in the art, that the ionic form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
[0061]	Isoolefm refers to any olefm monomer having two substitutions on<br>
the same carbon.<br>
0062]	Multiolefin refers to any monomer having two double bonds.<br>
[0063]	Elastomer or elastomeric composition, as used herein, refers to any<br>
Dolymer or composition of polymers consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition. The terms may be used interchangeably with the term "rubber(s)", as used herein.<br>
[0064]	Alkyl refers to a paraffinic hydrocarbon group which may be<br>
derived from an alkane by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula, such as, for example, a methyl group (CHs), or an ethyl group (CHsCFb), etc.<br>
[0065]	Aryl refers to a hydrocarbon group that forms a ring structure<br>
characteristic of aromatic compounds such as, for example, benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc., and typically possess alternate double bonding ("unsaturation") within its structure.

[0067]	In   one   embodiment,   this   invention   relates   to   the   use   of<br>
hydrofluorocarbon(s) or blends of hydrofluorocarbon(s) with hydrocarbon(s) and/or chlorinated hydrocarbon(s) to produce a polymer slurry which is less prone to fouling (i.e., also observed more glass like, less sticky particles in the reaction vessel with reduced adherence to the walls of the vessel or to the stirring impeller as well as reduced particle to particle agglomeration). More particularly, this invention relates to the use of hydrofluorocarbon diluent(s) or HFC diluent blends with hydrocarbons and/or chlorinated hydrocarbon blends to polymerize and copolymerize isoolefms with dienes and/or alkylstyrenes to produce isoolefin homopolymers and copolymers with significantly reduced reactor fouling. Further, this invention relates to the use of hydrofluorocarbon diluent(s) or diluent blends with hydrocarbons and/or chlorinated hydrocarbon blends to polymerize and copolymerize isoolefms with dienes to produce isoolefin copolymers with significantly reduced reactor fouling and hence longer run life for the reactors, as compared to conventional systems.<br>

polymerization systems using diluents containing hydrofluorocarbons.

For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto pseudohalogen is defined to be any compound that is an azide, an isocyanate, a thiocyanate, an isothiocyanate or a cyanide.<br>
[00110]	Another preferred initiator is a polymeric halide, one of Rl, R2 or<br>
R3 is an olefin polymer and the remaining R groups are defined as above. Preferred olefin polymers include polyisobutylene, polypropylene, and polyvinylchloride. The polymeric initiator may have halogenated tertiary carbon positioned at the chain end or along or within the backbone of the polymer. When the olefin polymer has multiple halogen atoms at tertiary carbons, either pendant to or within the polymer backbone, the product may contain polymers which have a comb like structure and/or side chain branching depending on the number and placement of the halogen atoms in the olefin polymer. Likewise, the use of a<br>
chain end tertiary polymer halide initiator provides a method for producing a product which may contain block copolymers.<br>
[00111]	Particularly preferred initiators may be any of those useful in<br>
cationic polymerization of isobutylene copolymers including: hydrogen chloride, 2-chloro-2,4,4-trimethylpentane, 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, 1 -chloro-1-methylethylbenzene, and methanol.<br>
[00112]	Catalyst system compositions useful in this invention typically<br>
comprise (1) an initiator and (2) a Lewis acid coinitiator or other metal complex(es) herein described. In a preferred embodiment, the Lewis acid coinitiator is present anywhere from about 0.1 moles times the moles of initiator present to about 200 times the moles of initiator present. In a further preferred embodiment, the Lewis acid coinitiator is present at anywhere from about 0.8 times the moles of initiator present to about 20 times the moles of initiator present. In a preferred embodiment the initiator is present at anywhere from about 0.1 moles per liter to about 10"6 moles per liter. It is of course understood that greater or lesser amounts of initiator are still within the scope of this invention.<br>
[00113]	The amount of the catalyst employed will depend on desired<br>
molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymer being produced. Typically the range will be from about IxlO"6 moles per liter to 3 x 10"2 moles per liter and most preferably from 10"4 to 10"3 moles per liter.<br>
[00114]	In certain embodiments, catalyst systems useful in this invention<br>
may further comprise a catalyst composition comprising of a reactive cation and a weakly-coordinating anion ("WC anion" or "WCA" or "NCA"). The catalyst composition comprising the WC anion will include a reactive cation and in certain instances are novel catalyst systems.<br>
[00115]	A weakly-coordinating anion is defined as an anion which either<br>
does not coordinate to the cation or which is weakly coordinated to the cation and<br>
when the anion is functioning as the stabilizing anion in this invention the WCA does not transfer an anionic fragment or substituent to the cation thus creating a neutral by-product or other neutral compound. Preferred examples of such weakly-coordinating anions include: alkyltris(pentafluorophenyl) boron<br>
(RB(pfp)3~), tetraperfluorophenylboron (B(pfp)4~), tetraperfluorophenylaluminum<br>
carboranes, halogenated carboranes and the like. The cation is any cation that can add to an olefm to create a carbocation.<br>
[00116]	The anion may be combined with the cation by any method known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example in a preferred embodiment the WC anion is introduced into the diluent as a compound containing both the anion and the cation in the form of the active catalyst system. In another preferred embodiment a composition containing the WC anion fragment is first treated to produce the anion in the presence of the cation or reactive cation source, i.e. the anion is activated. Likewise the WC anion may be activated without the presence of the cation or cation source which is subsequently introduced. In a preferred embodiment a composition containing the anion and a composition containing the cation are combined and allowed to react to form a by-product, the anion and the cation.<br>
Weakly-Coordinating Anions<br>
[00117]	Any metal or metalloid compound capable of forming an anionic<br>
complex which is incapable of transferring a substituent or fragment to the cation to neutralize the cation to produce a neutral molecule may be used as the WC anion. In addition any metal or metalloid capable of forming a coordination complex which is stable in water may also be used or contained in a composition comprising the anion. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to aluminum, gold, platinum and the like. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, silicon and the like. Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single<br>
boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially. In light of this, salts containing anions comprising a coordination complex containing a single boron atom are preferred.<br>
[00118]	In general, WC anions may be represented by the following general<br>
formula:<br>
[(M')m+Qi...Qn]d-wherein:<br>
M' is a metal or metalloid;<br>
Ql to Qn are' independently, bridged or unbridged hydride radicals, dialkylamido radicals, alkoxide and aryloxide radicals, hydrocarbyl and substituted-hydrocarbyl radicals, halocarbyl and substituted-halocarbyl radicals and hydrocarbyl and halocarbyl-substituted organometalloid radicals and any one, but not more than one of Qj to Qn may be a halide radical;<br>
m is an integer representing the formal valence charge of M; n is the total number of ligands q, and d is an integer greater than or equal to 1 .<br>
[00119]	It is of course understood that the anions described above and<br>
below may be counter balanced with a positively charged component that is removed before the anion acts with the cation. The same is true for cations described for use with the anions. For example, Cp2ZrMe2 may be combined<br>
with a composition comprising the anion (WCA~R+) where R+ acts with a Me group to leave the Cp2Zr+Me WCA~ catalyst system.<br>
[00120]	Preferred WC anions comprising boron may be represented by the<br>
following general formula:<br>
wherein:<br>
B is a boron in a valence state of 3 ;<br>
Aq and Ar2 are the same or different aromatic or substituted-aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon radicals containing from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms and may be linked to each other through a stable bridging group; and<br>
X3   and   X4   are,   independently,   hydride   radicals,   hydrocarbyl   and<br>
substituted-hydrocarbyl radicals, halocarbyl and substituted-halocarbyl radicals, hydrocarbyl- and halocarbyl-substituted organometalloid radicals, disubstituted pnictogen radicals, substituted chalcogen radicals and halide radicals, with the proviso that X3 and X4 will not be halide at the same time.<br>
[00121]	In general, Ar\ and Ar2 may, independently, be any aromatic of<br>
substituted-aromatic hydrocarbon radical. Suitable aromatic radicals include, but are not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl radicals. Suitable substituents on the substituted-aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, include, but are not necessarily limited to, hydrocarbyl radicals, organometalloid radicals, alkoxy and aryloxy radicals, fluorocarbyl and fluorohydrocarbyl radicals and the like such as those useful as X3 and X4. The substituent may be ortho, meta or para, relative to the<br>
carbon atoms bonded to the boron atom.   When either or both X3 and X4 are a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical, each may be the same or a different aromatic or substituted-aromatic radical as are Ar] and Ar2, or the same may be a straight or branched<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical, a cyclic hydrocarbon radical or an alkyl-substituted cyclic hydrocarbon radical. As indicated above, Arj and Ar2 could be<br>
linked to either X3 or X4- Finally, X3 and X4 may also be linked to each other through a suitable bridging group.<br>
[00122]	Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of boron components which<br>
may be used as WC anions are: tetravalent boron compounds such as<br>
tetra(phenyl)boron,	tetra(p-tolyl)boron,	tetra(o-tolyl)boron,<br>

[00123]	Similar lists of suitable components containing other metals and<br>
metalloids which are useful as WC anions may be made, but such lists are not deemed necessary to a complete disclosure. In this regard, it should be noted that the foregoing list is not intended to be exhaustive and that other useful boron compounds as well as useful compounds containing other metals or metalloids would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing general discussion and formulae.<br>
[00124]	A particularly preferred WC anion comprising boron may be<br>
represented by the following general formula:<br>

F is fluorine, C is carbon and B, and Q are as defined above. Illustrative but not limiting, examples of these preferred WC anions comprising boron triphenylmethyl salts where Q is a simple hydrocarbyl such as methyl, butyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl or where Q is a polymeric hydrocarbyl of indefinite chain length such as polystyrene, polyisoprene, or poly-paramethylstyrene.<br>
[00125]	Polymeric Q substituents on the most preferred anion offer the<br>
advantage of providing a highly soluble ion-exchange activator component and final catalyst. Soluble catalysts and/or precursors are often preferred over insoluble waxes, oils, or solids because they can be diluted to a desired concentration and can be transferred easily using simple equipment in commercial processes.<br>

represented by the following general formulae:<br>

B. Substituted Carbocations<br>
[00135]	Another preferred source for the cation is substituted carbocations.<br>
Preferred examples include substances that are represented by the formula:<br>
wherein Rj, R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen, or a linear, branched or cyclic aromatic or aliphatic groups, preferably a C \ to â¬20 aromatic or aliphatics group, provided that only one of Rj, R2 or rt, may be hydrogen.

and R3 are phenyl groups, the addition of an aliphatic or aromatic alcohol significantly enhances the polymerization of isobutylene.<br>
C. Substituted Silylium Cations<br>
[00136]	In     another     preferred     embodiment,     substituted     silylium<br>
compositions, preferably trisubstituted silylium compositions are combined with WCA's to polymerize monomers. Preferred silylium cations are those represented by the formula:<br>

A particularly preferred group of reactive substituted silylium cations may be selected from the group consisting of trimethylsilylium, triethylsilylium and benzyldimethylsilylium.<br>
[00137]	For a discussion of stable forms of the substituted silylium and<br>
synthesis thereof, see F.A. Cotton, G. Wilkinson, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1980. Likewise for stable forms of the cationic tin, germanium and lead compositions and synthesis thereof, see Dictionary of Organometallic compounds, Chapman and Hall New York 1984.<br>
(E)      cationic compositions of germanium, tin or lead, some of which are represented by the formula:<br>
wherein Rj, R2 and R3 are hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl groups or derivatives thereof, preferably Cj to â¬39 alkyl, aryl, aralkyl groups or derivatives thereof, and R* is Ge, Sn or Pb.<br>
A. Cyclopentadienyl Metal Derivatives<br>
[00132]	Preferred  cyclopentadienyl transition metal  derivatives include<br>
transition metals that are a mono-, bis- or tris- cyclopentadienyl derivative of a group 4, 5 or 6 transition metal, preferably a mono-cyclopentadienyl (Mono-Cp) or bis-cyclopentadienyl (Bis-Cp) group 4 transition metal compositions, particularly a zirconium, titanium or hafnium compositions.<br>
[00133]	Preferred cyclopentadienyl derivatives (cation sources) that may be<br>
combined with weakly-coordinating anions are represented by the following formulae:<br>
comprising the CpTm+ with a second compound comprising the WCA" which then react to form by-product and the active "weakly-coordinating" pair.<br>
Likewise, the CpTm+ compound may also be directly combined with the WCA' to form the active catalyst system. Typically the WCA is combined with the<br>
cation/cation source in ratios of 1 to 1, however ratios of 100 to 1 (CpTm+ to WCA) also work in the practice of this invention.<br>
[00141]	Active cationic catalysts can be prepared by reacting a transition<br>
metal compound with some neutral Lewis acids, such as B(CgF6)3n, which upon<br>
reaction with a hydrolyzable ligand (X) of the transition metal compound forms an anion, such as ([B(C6Fs)3(X)]"), which stabilizes the cationic transition metal species generated by the reaction.<br>
[00142]	A novel aspect of this invention is the active carbocationic catalyst<br>
complex which is formed and which can be represented by the formulae:<br>
( Figure Remove) <br>
wherein each G is independently hydrogen or an aromatic or aliphatic group, preferably a C\ to c\qq aliphatic group, and g is an integer representing the<br>
number of monomer units incorporated into the growing polymer chain, g is preferably a number greater than or equal to 1, preferably a number from 1 to<br>
about 150,000. WCA" is any weakly-coordinating anion as described above. All other symbols are as defined above.<br>
[00143]	In another embodiment this invention also provides active catalyst<br>
compositions which can be represented by the formulae:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
erein each G is independently a aliphatic or aromatic group, preferably a C\ to CjoO aliphatic or aromatic group, and g is a n integer representing the number of<br>
monomer units incorporated into the growing polymer chain, g is preferably a number greater than or equal to 1, preferably a number from 1 to about 50,000.<br>
WCA" is any weakly-coordinating anion as described above.   All other symbols are as defined above.<br>
B. Substituted Carbocation and Silylium Compounds<br>
[00144]	Generation of tri substituted carbocations and silylium cations may<br>
be performed before use in the polymerization or in situ. Pre-formation and isolation of the cation or the stable cation salts may be accomplished by reacting the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of the weakly-coordinating anion with the corresponding halogen of the potential carbocation or silylium similarly to methods known in the art. Formation of the substituted carbocations or silylium in situ occurs in a similar manner to stable salts, but within the vessel and at the desired temperature of polymerization. The advantage of the latter procedure is that it is capable of producing carbocations or silylium cations otherwise too unstable to be handled by the first method. The cation or the precursor to the cation is typically used in 1 to 1 ratios with the WCA, however ratios of 1 to 100<br>
(C+ or Si+ to WCA) also work in the practice of this invention.<br>
[00145]	A novel aspect of this invention is the active carbocationic catalyst<br>
complex which is formed and which can be represented by the formulae:<br>

[00152]	In one embodiment, the diluent comprises non-perfluorinated<br>
compounds or the diluent is a non-perfluorinated diluent. Perfluorinated compounds being those compounds consisting of carbon and fluorine. However, in another embodiment, when the diluent comprises a blend, the blend may comprise perfluorinated compounds, for example, tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroemane, octafluoropropane, and, decafluorobutane. Preferably, the<br>
catalyst, monomer, and diluent are present in a single phase or the aforementioned components are miscible with the diluent as described in further detail below. In another embodiment, the blend may also comprise chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), or those compounds consisting of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon.<br>
[00153]	In another embodiment, when higher weight average molecular<br>
weights (Mw) (typically greater than 10,000 Mw, preferably more than 50,000 Mw, more preferably more than 100,000 Mw) are desired, suitable diluents include hydrofluorocarbons with a dielectric constant of greater than 10 at -850C, preferably greater than 15, more preferably greater than 20, more preferably greater than 25, more preferably 40 or more. In embodiments where lower molecular weights (typically lower than 10,000 Mw, preferably less than 5,000 Mw, more preferably less than 3,000 Mw) are desired the dielectric constant may be less than 10, or by adding larger amounts of initiator or transfer agent when the dielectric constant is above 10. The dielectric constant of the diluent ed is determined from measurements of the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor immersed in the diluent [measured value cd], in a reference fluid of known dielectric constant er [measured value cr], and in air (ea=!) [measured value ca]. In each case the measured capacitance cm is given by cm- sCc+Cs, where e is the dielectric constant of the fluid in which the capacitor is immersed, Cc is the cell capacitance, and Cs is the stray capacitance. From these measurements ed is given by the formula ed=((cd-ca) eR + (CR-CD))/(CR-CA). Alternatively, a purpose-built instrument such as the Brookhaven Instrument Corporation BIC-870 may be used to measure dielectric constant of diluents directly. A comparison of the dielectric constants (e) of a few selected diluents at -85Â°C is provided below and graphically depicted in Figure 1.<br>

[00156]	In one embodiment, the HFC is used in combination with a<br>

In another embodiment the HFC's are used in combination with one or more gases inert to the polymerization such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, neon, helium, krypton, zenon, and/or other inert gases that are preferably liquid at entry to the reactor. Preferred gases include carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen.<br>
[00157]	In another embodiment the HFC's are used in combination with one<br>

A preferred embodiment is HFC's blended with nitromethane.<br>
[00158]	The HFC is typically present at 1 to 100 volume % based upon the<br>

In yet another preferred embodiment the HFC is selected from the group consisting of monofluoromethane, difluoromethane, and trifluoromethane.<br>
[00159]	In another embodiment the diluent or diluent mixture is selected<br>
based upon its solubility in the polymer. Certain diluents are soluble in the polymer. Preferred diluents have little to no solubility in the polymer. Solubility in the polymer is measured by forming the polymer into a film of thickness between 50 and 100 microns, then soaking it in diluent (enough to cover the film) for 4 hours at -75Â°C. The film is removed from the diluent, exposed to room temperature for 90 seconds to evaporate excess diluent from the surface of the film, and weighed. The mass uptake is defined as the percentage increase in the film weight after soaking. The diluent or diluent mixture is chosen so that the polymer has a mass uptake of less than 4 wt%, preferably less than 3 wt%, preferably less than 2 wt%, preferably less than 1 wt%, more preferably less than 0.5 wt%.<br>
[00160]	In a preferred embodiment, the diluent or diluent mixture is<br>
selected   such   that   the   difference   between   the   measured   glass   transition<br>
temperature Tg of the polymer with less than 0.1 wt% of any diluent, unreacted<br>
monomers and additives is within 15Â°C of the Tg of the polymer measured after it<br>
has been formed into a film of thickness between 50 and 100 microns, that has<br>
been soaked in diluent (enough to cover the film) for 4 hours at -75Â°C. The glass<br>
transition temperature is determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Techniques are well described in the literature, for example, B. Wunderlich, "The<br>
Nature of the Glass Transition and its Determination by Thermal Analysis", in<br>
Assignment of the Glass Transition, ASTM STP 1249, R. J. Seyler, Ed., American<br>
Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, 1994, pp. 17-31.  The sample is<br>
prepared as described above, sealed immediately after soaking into a DSC sample<br>
pan, and maintained at a temperature below -80Â°C until immediately before the<br>
DSC measurement.    Preferably the Tg values are within 12Â°C of each other,<br>
preferably within 11Â°C of each other, preferably within 10Â°C of each other,<br>
preferably within 9Â°C of each other, preferably within 8Â°C of each other,<br>
preferably within 7Â°C of each other, preferably within 6Â°C of each other,<br>
preferably within 5Â°C of each other, preferably within 4Â°C of each other,<br>
preferably within 3Â°C of each other, preferably within 3Â°C of each other,<br>
preferably within 2Â°C of each other, preferably within 1Â°C of each other.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
[00161]	The invention may be practiced in continuous and batch processes.<br>
Further the invention may be practiced in a plug flow reactor and/or stirred tank reactors. In particular this invention may be practiced in "butyl reactors." Illustrative examples include any reactor selected from the group consisting of a continuous flow stirred tank reactor, a plug flow reactor, a moving belt or drum reactor, a jet or nozzle reactor, a tubular reactor, a reactor proceeding in accordance with the Leidenfrost phenomenon, and an autorefrigerated boiling-pool reactor.<br>
[00162]	In a preferred embodiment, the polymerization processes described<br>
herein utilize a boiling pool reactor system.    Particularly relevant examples<br>
include but are limited to Example 12 as an inventive example and Examples 13 and 14 as comparative examples. Additionally, Examples 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 (inventive examples) and Examples 10 and 11 (comparative examples) are also particularly relevant examples. It is well within the understanding in the art that the polymerization temperature is dependent upon the composition of the polymerization medium and the pressure within the reactor; it is also well within the skill in the art on how to adjust such parameters to obtain any desired polymerization temperature.<br>
[00163]	In an aspect of the invention, the polymerization processes of the<br>
present invention are utilized with a boiling pool reactor system as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,714,747. In particular, Figure 4 provides an exemplary diagram.1 In some embodiments, a boiling pool reactor system generally comprises the steps of (a) cooling a feed stream of a monomer mixture, a diluent, and optionally, a catalyst system, to a polymerization temperature of -70Â°C to 15Â°C by vaporization of a portion thereof under reduced pressure to form a cooled feed stream; (b) supplying the cooled feed stream to a reactor that comprises a self-cleaning screw extruder and polymerizing therein under boiling plug-flow conditions at a constant pressure of 0.1 to 4 Bar absolute using a catalyst system and (c) removing polymer product, at a concentration, for example, of at least 50% for recovery and a vaporized mixture of unreacted monomers and polymerization medium, for recycle, generally at the reactor outlet.<br>
[00164]	In certain embodiments, the monomer mixture comprises from 75<br>
wt% to 100 wt% of isobutylene and 25 wt% to 0 wt% of a conjugated diene comonomer, such as isoprene (based on the weight of monomer mixture). The feed stream is generally continuously supplied along with the monomer mixture, the diluent, and, optionally, catalyst system components.<br>
[00165]	The self-cleaning screw extruder used in the process of the present<br>
invention may be a twin-screw extruder or may be a specially designed apparatus, each capable of carrying a material of progressively increasing viscosity from inlet to outlet in a plug-flow type movement. Twin-screw extruders have two screws which intermesh with each other and consequently are almost completely self-cleaning. Examples of twin-screw extruders are those available from such manufacturers as Werner and Pfleider of West Germany and Baker and Perkins of U.S.A. Other commercially available examples are available from Dipl Inj. H. List of Switzerland. Further details of these two types of specially designed apparatus are given in the literature available from the manufacturers.<br>
[00166]	In  Figure  4,  an  example  of a boiling  pool  reactor  system<br>
comprising a plug flow extruder reactor is provided. One skilled in the art will appreciate variations of the diagram. The outlet is fitted with a twin discharge screw 3 mounted vertically across the outlet and connecting via valve 21 to a twin screw desolventiser 5. A feed stream comprising the monomer mixture and diluent, and optionally, catalyst system components, is fed to form a polymerization medium. It is supplied via line 17, heat exchanger 49, line 51 and throttle valve 47 to flash drum 15 together with recycled polymerization medium supplied via line 53. In flash drum 15, a lowering of pressure occurs which involves vaporization of a fraction of the polymerization medium. This brings down the temperature of the liquid to the polymerization temperature. The cooled stream of the polymerization medium are supplied to extruder 1, via line 29, the stream being split and supplied at points along the extruder 1, via lines 31, 33, 35, and 37 to ensure thorough distribution. When the catalyst system components are not part of the feed stream, the catalyst system is supplied at the head of the extruder screw via line 19.<br>
[00167]	The monomers consumed  are continuously replaced by fresh<br>
monomers via lines 31, 33, 35, and 37. At the extruder outlet section, polymer particles are forced into the twin discharge screw 3. In discharge screw 3, the polymer particles are squeezed by the screws so that any entrapped<br>
polymerization medium is separated and overflows back towards the extruder 1, whereas the gaseous polymerization medium vents through the vapor outlet line 25, for recycle. Under the screw action of discharge screw 3, the polymer particles are forced through valve 21, the opening of which is controlled by pressure control 23. The polymer enters heated twin screw desolventiser 5 to which catalyst deactivator and antioxidant are supplied via supply lines (not shown). In the heated desolventiser 5 residual diluent and monomers are vaporized and supplied via line 39 to a conventional recovery section (not shown). The polymer, substantially free of diluent and monomers, is supplied via line 41 to a finishing section for baling and packaging.<br>
[00168]	The extruder contains a vapor phase since the process of the<br>
invention is carried out under boiling conditions, for example, temperatures between about -100Â°C to about 15Â°C, such as above about -50Â°C, at pressures in the range from about .1 to about 6 Bar absolute. For example, at -45Â°C the reactor is kept at the equilibrium pressure of from about .1 to about 4 Bar absolute, such as 0.3 Bar absolute. Reaction heat is therefore removed as latent heat of evaporation of the polymerization medium. Polymerization medium leaving the extruder via line 25, passes via knock-out drum 7 and line 43 to compressor 9. In the compressor 9, the vapors are compressed and then are cooled by cooling water or refrigerant, condensed in heat exchanger 11 for return to the flash drum 15, via line 53 and throttle valve 13 through which the pressure decreases to that of the extruder. In flash drum 15, a portion of the feed vaporizes and passes to compressor 9, via line 45, drum 7 and line 43 and liquid feed in drum 15 cools to the temperature of extruder 1, before supply via line 29. Any non condensables in heat exchanger 11 are removed via an outlet situated at the coldest section of the heat exchanger towards a vacuum pump (not shown) via line 27.<br>
[00169]	By the above described arrangement of compressor, heat exchanger<br>
and throttle valve and associated equipment all the boiled-off monomer-diluent mixture vapor from the extruder is recycled to the extruder as a liquid at the same<br>
temperature as said vapor thus extracting from the extruder the latent heat of vaporization for each unit weight of mixture recycled.<br>
[00170]	The pressure into the extruder is kept constant by controlling<br>
through conventional means, the flow rate of the vapors to compressor 9. At constant pressure, the temperature of the boiling liquid is constant, once a steady state of liquid composition is reached.<br>
[00171]	The temperature of the polymerization medium in reactor 1 would<br>
tend to increase because of the heat of polymerization developed therein. However, this tendency is countered by the evaporation of a portion of the polymerization medium in reactor 1 enabling polymerization heat to be removed. It will be appreciated that this arrangement reduces the need to use a fluid refrigerant at a temperature below that of the polymerization enabling significant energy consumption economies to be made.<br>
[00172]	In another aspect of the invention, the polymerization processes of<br>
the present invention are utilized with a boiling pool reactor system as described in WO 93/21241. In this embodiment, the reactor is a vertical cylindrical vessel, equipped with a special stirrer as indicated by Figures 5-7. The reactor is equipped with an inlet for the feed stream, and, in some embodiments, two inlets for feeding the catalyst system. The reactor is also equipped with a vapor outlet, placed in the reactor ceiling. In Figure 6, a vertical section is shown. The reactor wall is indicated by 55, 57 and 59 are respectively the reactor ceiling and bottom, 61 is the stirrer shaft, 63 is a standing shaft fastened to the reactor bottom, 65 is one of the vertical paddles, moved by shaft 61 to which they are connected by the cross bar 67. The rotating bars 69 intermesh with standing crossbars 71. 73 is an extruder barrel fastened to the reactor, to which it is connected via slit 77. This extruder, equipped with its screw 75, is hereinafter referred to as "discharge screw". 79 is a throttle valve.<br>
[00173]	A horizontal reactor section is shown in Figure 7.   The section is<br>
along a standing bar 71. In this figure, three paddles 65, one bar 71 and the slit 77 are shown. The three paddles 65 have a peculiar shape and orientation. When they rotate (according to the direction indicated by an arrow), the clearance between a point on the reactor wall and the paddle decreases till to a very small clearance. Thus, the polymer is directed toward extruder 73. 75 is a discharge screw.<br>
[00174]	In several embodiments, the reactor operates at a constant level of<br>
polymerization medium.<br>
[00175]	Polymer particles are continuously formed in the reactor, and are<br>
immediately conveyed by the stirrer across the reactor, toward its peripheric part, where the slurry discharge 77 is placed, with a continuous skimming action.<br>
[00176]	The rather small clearance among moving and standing surfaces of<br>
the stirrer/reactor system limits the surfaces fouling, but does not hamper the polymerization medium to flow across the clearances. In this way, the polymerization medium is better homogenized throughout the reactor.<br>
[00177]	The polymer skimming is performed in the following way: the<br>
polymerization medium is present in the peripherical part of the reactor is continuously taken into the rather large clearance between the paddle leading edge and the reactor wall. The polymerization medium can easily flow through the clearance between the paddle rear edge and the reactor wall. The polymer particles are collected. Therefore, the slurry concentration in the space between the paddle and the reactor wall increases during the paddles motion. The rear paddle edge squeezes the polymer slurry against the wall which increases the solid content of the slurry, whereas the liquid is squeezed out. Whenever a paddle 65 passes in front of slit 77, the slurry is pumped through it, toward the discharge screw 75, which carries it up. Therefore, whenever a paddle 65 passes in front of slit 77, part of the slurry contained in the volume between paddle and wall is<br>
cleared out, and is ready to be re-filled by another amount of slurry, coming from the axial part of the reactor. A step carved in the rear edge of paddles 65 decreases the gap between the paddle and wall and increases the skimming efficiency.<br>
[00178]	At a certain stirrer rotation speed, the polymer discharged by the<br>
reactor in unit time increases proportionally to the polymer concentration.<br>
[00179]	At a certain polymer concentration, the polymer discharged by the<br>
reactor in unit time increases proportionally to the stirrer rotation speed.<br>
[00180]	Consequently,  the   above   reactor  has   a  built-in  capacity   of<br>
controlling the polymer concentration inside the reactor. Once a certain value of polymer output has been selected, by feeding the catalyst at a certain rate, the polymer concentration inside the reactor cannot overcome an upper threshold limit, which is imposed by the stirrer rotation speed. In this way, any excessive polymer content inside the reactor is avoided, with the related risks of reactor "blocking" or of excessive mechanical stress applied to the stirrer.<br>
[00181]	Figure 5 provides a general diagram of a boiling pool reactor<br>
system. The polymerization reactor is indicated by number 55. The reactor outlet 77 joins the reactor to the discharge screw 75, which in turn is connected via throttle valve 79, to the double screw devolatilizer 81. The monomers and diluent are fed via lines 83, 85, 87 to heat exchanger 89, where they are cooled down to polymerization temperature, and thereafter to the reactor, via line 91. One skilled in the art will recognized that lines 83, 85, and 87 may be varied or combined. The catalyst system components are fed via lines 93 and 95. Again, one skilled in the art will recognize that these lines may be varied or combined.<br>
[00182]	The processes of the invention are carried out under boiling<br>
conditions, for example, temperatures between about -100Â°C to about 15Â°C, such as above about -50Â°C, at pressures in the range from about .1 to about 6 Bar<br>
absolute. For example, at -45Â°C the reactor is kept at the equilibrium pressure of from about .1 to about 4 Bar absolute, such as 0.3 Bar absolute.<br>
[00183]	The vapors are collected in the reactor dome and then, via line 97<br>
to the knockout drum 99. An analyzer control AC on line 97 adds more monomers from stream 83 and 85 to maintain a constant production rate. The vapors in knockout drum 99 are sent to compressor 103, via line 101. The compressed vapors are cooled and condensed in heat exchanger 105.<br>
[00184]	The condensate is flashed in flash dram 107, via throttle valve 109,<br>
which drops the pressure to the same level as that of the reactor 55. In flash drum 107 a part of the condensate fed to throttle valve 109 is vaporized and recycled to knock-out drum 99, via line 111, and therefrom to compressor 103, via line 101, together with the vapors coming from the reactor, via line 97. A part of the condensate fed to throttle valve 109 is collected in flash drum 107 as a liquid, at a temperature close to that of reactor 55. This liquid is sent to the reactor under level control, via line 113. In a steady state, the vapors produced by reactor 55 are almost completely recycled to it as liquids, at a temperature close to that of the reactor. The polymerization heat is removed from the reactor as latent vaporization heat.<br>
[00185]	Any non-condensable in heat exchanger 105 is purged via an outlet<br>
placed in the coldest part of heat exchanger 105 and sent, via line 115, to a vacuum pump (not shown in Figure 5).<br>
[00186]	The slurry produced by the reactor is concentrated, as already said,<br>
in the discharge screw 75, fed through throttle valve 79 to mechanical devolatilizer 81, where the residual liquids are removed, by combined thermal and mechanical action, as vapors via line 117. For example, the polymer concentration at the reactor outlet can be high as 50 wt%-70 wt% at the discharge screw outlet. The polymer substantially free of diluent and monomers, is supplied via line 119 to a finishing section for baling and packaging.<br>
[00187]	In an alternative embodiment, as shown in Figure 8, the invention<br>
is practiced similarly to what is described in Figures 5-7. However, in this embodiment, the discharge screw 75 and barrel 73 are replaced by a runnel 125 located near the top surface of the liquid phase connected via line 121 to valve 79 and onward to the double screw devolatilizer 81. The mixing mechanism in Figures 6 and 7, i.e., 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, and 71 may also be replaced with a conventional impeller 123. For example, a conventional impeller may be an axial flow impeller or radial flow impeller, i.e., up-pumping or down-pumping.<br>
[00188]	In any of the aforementioned embodiments, the polymerization<br>
temperature may be from 15Â°C to -100Â°C, alternatively, from -30Â°C to -70Â°C, and alternatively, from -40Â°C to -60Â°C.<br>
[00189]	In any of the aforementioned embodiments, the polymerization<br>
medium may be evaporated at pressures from .01 Bar absolute to 6 Bar absolute, alternatively, from .1 Bar absolute to 1 Bar absolute, and alternatively, from .3 Bar absolute to 1 Bar absolute.<br>
[00190]	In any of the aforementioned embodiments, the polymerization<br>
medium may be evaporated at pressures from 1 kPa to 400 kPa, alternatively, from 10 kPa to 100 kPa, and alternatively, from 30 kPa to 100 kPa.<br>
[00191]	This invention may also be practiced in batch reactors where the<br>
monomers, diluent, and catalyst are charged to the reactor and then polymerization proceeds to completion (such as by quenching) and the polymer is then recovered.<br>
[00192]	In certain embodiments, the invention is practiced, using a slurry<br>
polymerization process. However, other polymerization methods are contemplated such as a solution polymerization process. The polymerization processes of the invention may be cationic polymerization processes.<br>
[00193]	In one embodiment, the polymerization is carried out where the<br>
catalyst, monomer, and diluent are present in a single phase. Preferably, the polymerization is carried-out in a continuous polymerization process in which the catalyst, monomer(s), and diluent are present as a single phase. In slurry polymerization, the monomers, catalyst(s), and initiator(s) are all miscible in the diluent or diluent mixture, i.e., constitute a single phase, while the polymer precipitates from the diluent with good separation from the diluent. Desirably, reduced or no polymer "swelling" is exhibited as indicated by little or no Tg suppression of the polymer and/or little or no diluent mass uptake as shown in Figure 2. Thus, polymerization in the diluents of the present invention provides for high polymer concentration to be handled at low viscosity with good heat transfer, reduced reactor fouling, homogeneous polymerization and/or the convenience of subsequent reactions to be run directly on the resulting polymer mixture.<br>
[00194]	The reacted monomers within the reactor form part of a slurry. In<br>
one embodiment, the concentration of the solids in the slurry is equal to or greater than 10 vol%. In another embodiment, the concentration of solids in the slurry is present in the reactor equal to or greater than 25 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in the slurry is less than or equal to 75 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry is present in the reactor from 1 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry is present in the reactor from 5 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 10 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 15 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 20 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 25 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 30 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 40 to 70 vol%.<br>
[00195]	In some embodiments, the feed-stream is substantially free from<br>
silica cation producing species. By substantially free of silica cation producing species, it is meant that there is no more than 0.0005 wt% based on the total weight of the monomers of these silica cation producing species in the feed stream. Typical examples of silica cation producing species are halo-alkyl silica compounds having the formula RiRiRsSiX or RiRsSiXi, etc., wherein "R" is an alkyl and "X" is a halogen. The reaction conditions will be such that desirable temperature, pressure and residence time are effective to maintain the reaction medium in the liquid state and to produce the desired polymers having the desired characteristics. The monomer feed-stream is typically substantially free of any impurity which is adversely reactive with the catalyst under the polymerization conditions. For example, in some embodiments, the monomer feed preferably should be substantially free of bases (such as caustic), sulfur-containing compounds (such as t^S, COS, and organo-mercaptans, e.g., methyl mercaptan, ethyl mercaptan), nitrogen-containing bases, oxygen containing bases such as alcohols and the like. However monomer feed may be less pure, typically not less than 95% based on total olefmic content, more preferably not less than 98%, not less than 99%. In preferred embodiments the impurities are present at less than 10,000 ppm (by weight), preferably less that 500 ppm, preferably less than 250 ppm, preferably less than 150 ppm, preferably less than 100 ppm.<br>
[00196]	As is normally the case, reaction time, temperature, concentration,<br>
the nature of the reactants, and similar factors determine product molecular weights. The polymerization reaction temperature is conveniently selected based on the target polymer molecular weight and the monomer to be polymerized as well as standard process variable and economic considerations, e.g., rate, temperature control, etc. The temperature for the polymerization is less than 15Â°C, preferably between 10Â°C and the freezing point of the slurry in one embodiment, and from -25Â°C to -120Â°C in another embodiment. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the polymerization temperature is from -40Â°C to -100Â°C, and from -70Â°C to -100Â°C in yet another embodiment. In yet another desirable embodiment, the temperature range is from -60Â°C to -100Â°C. Consequently, different reaction conditions will produce products of different molecular weights. Synthesis of the desired reaction product may be achieved, therefore, through monitoring the course of the reaction by the examination of samples taken periodically during the reaction; a technique widely employed in the art.<br>
[00197]	In a preferred embodiment, the polymerization temperature is<br>
within 10Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 8Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 6Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 4Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 2Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 1Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent. For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto when the phrase "within XÂ°C above the freezing point of the diluent" is used it means the freezing point of the diluent plus XÂ°C. For example if the freezing point of the diluent is -98Â°C, then 10Â°C above the freezing point of the diluent is -88Â°C.<br>
[00198]	The  order  of contacting  the  monomer   feed-stream,   catalyst,<br>
initiator, and diluent may vary from one embodiment to another.<br>
[00199]	In another embodiment, the initiator and Lewis acid are pre-<br>
complexed by mixing together in the selected diluent for a prescribed amount of time ranging from 0.01 second to 10 hours, and then is injected into the continuous reactor through a catalyst nozzle or injection apparatus. In yet another embodiment, Lewis acid and the initiator are added to the reactor separately. In another embodiment, the initiator is blended with the feed monomers before injection to the reactor. Desirably, the monomer is not contacted with the Lewis acid, or the Lewis acid combined with the initiator before the monomers enter the reactor.<br>
[00200]	In an embodiment of the invention, the initiator and Lewis acid are<br>
allowed to pre-complex by mixing together in the selected diluent at temperatures between -40Â°C and the freezing point temperature of the diluent, with a contact time between 0.01 seconds and several hours, and between 0.1 seconds and 5 minutes, preferably less than 3 minutes, preferably between 0.2 seconds and 1 minute before injection into the reactor.<br>
[00201]	In another embodiment of the invention, the initiator and Lewis<br>
acid are allowed to pre-complex by mixing together in the selected diluent at temperatures between 80Â°C and the freezing point of the diluent, typically between -40Â°C and -100Â°C.<br>
[00202]	The overall residence time in the reactor can vary, depending upon,<br>
e.g., catalyst activity and concentration, monomer concentration, feed injection rate, production rate, reaction temperature, and desired molecular weight, and generally will be between about a few seconds and five hours, and typically between about 10 and 60 minutes. Variables influencing residence time include the monomer and diluent feed injection rates and the overall reactor volume.<br>
[00203]	The catalyst (Lewis acid) to monomer ratio utilized will be those<br>
conventional in this art for carbocationic polymerization processes. In one embodiment of the invention, the monomer to catalyst mole ratios will typically be from 500 to 10000, and in the range of 2000 to 6500 in another embodiment. In yet another desirable embodiment, the ratio of Lewis acid to initiator is from 0.5 to 10, or from 0.75 to 8. The overall concentration of the initiator in the reactor is typically from 5 to 300 ppm or 10 to 250 ppm. The concentration of the initiator in the catalyst feed stream is typically from 50 to 3000 ppm in one embodiment. Another way to describe the amount of initiator in the reactor is by its amount relative to the polymer. In one embodiment, there is from 0.25 to 20 moles polymer/mole initiator, and from 0.5 to 12 mole polymer/mole initiator in another embodiment.<br>
[00204]	The reactor will contain sufficient amounts of the catalyst system<br>
of the present invention to catalyze the polymerization of the monomer containing feed-stream such that a sufficient amount of polymer having desired characteristics is produced. The feed-stream in one embodiment contains a total monomer concentration greater than 20 wt% (based on the total weight of the monomers, diluent, and catalyst system), greater than 25 wt% in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the feed-stream will contain from 30 wt% to 50 wt% monomer concentration based on the total weight of monomer, diluent, and catalyst system.<br>
[00205]	Catalyst  efficiency  (based  on  Lewis  acid)   in the  reactor  is<br>
maintained between 10,000 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst and 300 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst and desirably in the range of 4000 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst to 1000 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst by controlling the molar ratio of Lewis acid to initiator.<br>
[00206]	In one embodiment, the resultant polymer from one embodiment of<br>
the invention is a polyisobutylene/isoprene polymer (butyl rubber) that has a molecular weight distribution of from about 2 to 7, and an unsaturation of from 0.5 to 5.0, alternatively, from 0.5 to 10.0 mole, per 100 mole of monomer. This product may be subjected to subsequent halogenation to afford a halogenated butyl rubber.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS<br>
[00208]	The polymers of the invention provide chemical and physical<br>
characteristics that make them highly useful in wide variety of applications. The low degree of permeability to gases accounts for the largest uses of these polymers, namely inner tubes and tire innerliners. These same properties are also of importance in air cushions, pneumatic springs, air bellows, accumulator bags, and pharmaceutical closures. The thermal stability of the polymers of the invention make them ideal for rubber tire-curing bladders, high temperature service hoses, and conveyor belts for hot material handling.<br>
[00209]	The polymers exhibit high damping and have uniquely broad<br>
damping and shock absorption ranges in both temperature and frequency. They are useful in molded rubber parts and find wide applications in automobile suspension bumpers, auto exhaust hangers, and body mounts.<br>
[00210]	The polymers of the instant invention are also useful in tire<br>
sidewalls and tread compounds. In sidewalls, the polymer characteristics impart good ozone resistance, crack cut growth, and appearance. The polymers of the invention may also be blended. Properly formulated blends with high diene rubbers that exhibit phase co-continuity yield excellent sidewalls. Improvements in wet, snow, and ice skid resistances and in dry traction without compromises in abrasion resistance and rolling resistance for high performance tires can be accomplished by using the polymers of the instant invention.<br>
[00211]	Blends of the polymers of the invention with thermoplastic resins<br>
are used for toughening of these compounds. High-density polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene are often modified with 5 to 30 wt % of polyisobutylene. In certain applications, the instant polymers provide for a highly elastic compound that is processable in thermoplastic molding equipment. The polymers of the instant invention may also be blended with polyamides to produce other industrial applications.<br>
[00212]	The polymers of the instant invention may also be used as<br>
adhesives, caulks, sealants, and glazing compounds. They are also useful as plasticizers in rubber formulations with butyl, SBR, and natural rubber. In linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) blends, they induce cling to stretch-wrap films. They are also widely employed in lubricants as dispersants and in potting and electrical cable filling materials.<br>
[00213]	In certain applications, the polymers of the invention make them<br>
also useful in chewing-gum, as well as in medical applications such as pharmaceutical stoppers, and the arts for paint rollers.<br>
[00214]	The following examples reflect embodiments of the invention and<br>
are by no means intended to be limiting of the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[00215]	The   polymerizations   were   performed   glass   reaction   vessels,<br>
equipped with a teflon turbine impeller on a glass stir shaft driven by an external electrically driven stirrer. The size and design of the glass vessels is noted for each set of examples. The head of the reactor included ports for the stir shaft, thermocouple and addition of initiator/coinitiator solutions. The reactor was cooled to the desired reaction temperature, listed in the Tables, by immersing the assembled reactor into a pentane or isohexane bath in the dry box. The<br>
temperature of the stirred hydrocarbon bath was controlled to + 2Â°C.    All<br>
apparatus in liquid contact with the reaction medium were dried at 120Â°C and<br>
cooled   in   a  nitrogen  atmosphere   before   use.      Isobutylene   (Matheson   or<br>
ExxonMobil) and methyl chloride (Air Products) were dried by passing the gas<br>
through three stainless steel columns containing barium oxide and were condensed<br>
and collected as liquids in the dry box.  Alternatively, methyl chloride was dried<br>
by passing the gas through stainless steel columns containing silica gel and<br>
molecular sieves.  Both materials were condensed and collected as liquids in the<br>
dry box. Isoprene (Aldrich) was dried over calcium hydride and distilled under<br>
Argon.   p-Methylstyrene (Aldrich) was dried over calcium hydride and distilled<br>
under vacuum.    TMPC1 (2-chloro-2,4,4,-trimethylpentane) was prepared from<br>
2,4,4-trimethylpentene-l and a 2.0 mol/L solution of HC1 in diethyl ether.   The<br>
TMPC1 was distilled before use. The HC1 (Aldrich, 99% pure) stock solution was<br>
prepared by dissolving a desirable amount of HC1 gas in dry MeCl to achieve 2-3<br>
% concentration by weight.    The hydrofluorocarbons that were collected as clear,<br>
colorless liquids at -95Â°C were used as received.    Hydrofluorocarbons that<br>
remained cloudy or had visible insoluble precipitates at -95Â°C were distilled<br>
before use.   Propane (Aldrich), used as received, was condensed and used as a<br>
liquid. Alkylaluminum dichlorides (Aldrich) were used as hydrocarbon solutions.<br>
These solutions were either purchased or prepared from the neat alkylaluminum<br>
dichloride.<br>
[00216]	The   slurry   copolymerizations   were   performed  by   dissolving<br>
monomer and comonomer into the liquefied hydrofluorocarbon at polymerization temperature and stirred at a pre-determined stirring speed between 800 to 1000 rpm. The use of a processor controlled electric stirring motor allowed control of the stirring speed to within 5 rpm. The initiator/coinitiator solutions were prepared either in the hydrofluorocarbon or, for convenience of small-scale experiments, in a small volume of methyl chloride. The initiator/coinitiator solutions were prepared by dissolving the initiator into the diluent (specified in each of the examples) and adding, with mixing, a 1.0 M solution of the alkylaluminum halide. The initiator/coinitiator solution was used immediately.<br>
The initiator/coinitiator solution was added dropwise to the polymerization using a chilled glass Pasteur pipette or, optionally, a jacketed dropping runnel for examples using the 500 ml glass reaction vessels. When a second or third initiator/coinitiator addition is specified in the examples, we refer to the preparation and addition of a second or third batch of freshly prepared initiator/coinitiator solution identical in volume and concentrations to the first batch. The physical behavior of the rubber particles and the state of fouling was determined at the end of the addition of each catalyst batch by stopping and removing the stir shaft and probing the particles with a chilled spatula. Stirring was begun again and the reaction quenched with the addition of greater than 100 microliters of methanol. Conversion is reported as weight percent of the monomers converted to polymer.<br>
[00217]	Polymer  molecular  weights   were   determined   by   SEC   (Size<br>
Exclusion Chromatography) using a Waters Alliance 2690 separations module equipped with column heaters and a Waters 410 differential refractometer detector. Tetrahydrofuran was used as eluent (1 ml/min., 35Â°C) with a set of Waters Styragel HR s\jl columns of 500, 1000, 2000, 104, 105 and 106A pore size. A calibration based on narrow molecular weight polyisobutylene standards (American Polymer Standards) was used to calculate molecular weights and distributions.<br>
[00218]	Polymer molecular weights can be determined on other SEC<br>
instruments using different calibration and run protocols. The methodolgy of SEC (also know as GPC or gel permeation chromatography) to characterize polymer molecular weights has been reviewed in many publications. One such source is the review provided by L.H. Tung in Polymer Yearbook, H.-G. Elias and R. A. Pethrick, Eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, New York, 1984, pgs. 93-100, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[00219]	Comonomer    incorporation    was    determined    by     'H-NMR<br>
spectrometry.      NMR   measurements   were   obtained   at   a   field   strength<br>
corresponding to 400 MHz or 500 MHz. 'H-NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer system using CDCb solutions of the polymers. All chemical shifts were referenced to TMS.<br>
[00220]	A variety of NMR methods have  been used to characterize<br>
comonomer incorporation and sequence distribution in copolymers. Many of these methods may be applicable to the polymers of this invention. A general reference which reviews the application of NMR spectrometry to the characterization of polymers is H. R. Kricheldorf in Polymer Yearbook, H.-G. Elias and R. A. Pethrick, Eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, New York, 1984, pgs. 249-257, herein incorporated by reference.<br>

particles that did not adhere to the walls of the reactor or to the stirring shaft. The particles floated to the surface of the liquid when stirring stopped.  The particles<br>
were hard as evidenced by pressing on them with a chilled spatula when tested near reaction temperature. Polymerization in methyl chloride resulted in rubber particles that adhered to both the reactor walls and the stirring shaft. The particles were clearly rubbery when probed with a chilled spatula when tested near reaction temperature. Polymerization in propane resulted in a two-phase liquid-liquid reaction. The denser phase was clearly rich in polymer where as the lighter phase was rich in propane.<br>

Very little of the polymer was "suspended" in the diluent medium. The propane based polymerization experiment did not look appreciably different than the run at -95Â°C (Table 1, Example 11). Two phases were apparent in the reactor. The denser phase was rich in polymer and the lighter phase rich in propane. The polymer in the presence of the propane diluent was considerably less viscous than the polymer formed in the methyl chloride run.<br>

The final mol/L concentrations of ethylaluminum dichloride and hydrogen chloride in the stock solution is the same for both preparations. Polymerizations were terminated with the addition of 0.2 ml of methanol. Polymerization in 3,3,3-trifluoropropene resulted in rubber particles that did not adhere to the walls of the reactor or to the stirring bar. The particles floated to the surface of the liquid when stirring stopped. The particles were hard as evidenced by pressing on them with a chilled spatula when tested near reaction temperature. Polymerization in methyl chloride resulted in rubber particles that adhered to both the reactor walls and the stirring shaft. Polymerization in 1,1-dichloroethane or 1,1-dichloroethene resulted in solvent swollen polymer particles that adhered to the reactor walls and the stirring bar.<br><br>

-35Â°C.  Examples 127 - 136 are comparative examples with Examples 137 - 141 being examples of this invention.<br>
[00247]	Polymerizations were run by the dropwise addition of a stock<br>
solution of the coinitiator/initiator pair. A stock solution of ethylaluminum dichloride and hydrogen chloride (HC1) was prepared in methyl chloride by adding 0.320 ml of a 1.0 mol/L HC1 solution in 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and 0.960 ml of a 1.0 mol/L ethylaluminum dichloride solution in hexane to 100 ml of methyl chloride. A separate stock solution of ethylaluminum dichloride and hydrogen chloride was used for Examples 134, 135 and 136. This solution was prepared from the addition of 0.034 ml of a 0.93 mol/L HC1 solution in 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and 0.0960 ml of a 1.0 mol/L ethylaluminum dichloride solution in hexane to 10 ml of methyl chloride. The final mol/L concentrations of ethylaluminum dichloride and hydrogen chloride in the stock solution are the<br>
same for both preparations. A separate stock solution of methylaluminum dichloride (MADC) / 2-chloro-2,4,4-trimethylpentane (TMPC1) was used for Examples 132 and 133. The MADC/TMPC1 solution was prepared from the addition of 6.6 microliters of TMPC1 and 0.0960 ml of a 1.0 mol/L methylaluminum dichloride solution in hexane to 10 ml of methyl chloride. The total volume of the stock solution added to the polymerization for each example is listed in Table 16.<br>
[00248]	Polymerizations were terminated with the addition of 0.2 ml of<br>
methanol. The polymerization in 1,1-difluoroethane or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane gave rubber particles that exhibited stiff-rubbery physical properties as evidenced by probing with a chilled spatula at reaction temperature. Minor amounts of fouling were evident on the reactor walls and stirring bar. In comparison, the polymerization in methyl chloride resulted in a viscous coating of polymer on both the reactor walls and the stirring bar. Very little of the polymer was "suspended" in the diluent medium. Polymerization in 1,2-difluorobenzene or 1,2-dichloroethane resulted in solvent swollen polymer phases that adhered to the reactor walls and the stirring bar. Polymerization in 1,1,1-trichloroethane occurred in solution. Polymer was recovered by removing weathering off the solvent.<br><br>

Examples 142-146<br>
[00249]	Table  17 lists the results of copolymerizations of isobutylene<br>
isoprene that were conducted at -95Â°C CH2FCF3. The isobutylene/isoprene feed ratio was changed for each example. A three-neck 500 ml glass reactor was used for these examples. Prior to each polymerization, 300 ml of monomer feed containing 10 wt% of monomers were charged into the chilled reactor. The initiator/coinitiator molar ratio was controlled at 1/3 and the concentration was set at 0.1 wt% EADC in MeCl. The initiator/coinitiator solution was added dropwise to the polymerization mixture and the rate of addition is controlled in such as way<br>
o<br>
so that the reactor temperature raise did not exceed 4 C. The amount of initiator/coinitiator solution added in each depended on the desired monomer conversion target.<br><br>
(Table Remove) <br>
[00250]	These examples demonstrate the preparation of high molecular<br>
weight copolymers with high isoprene incorporation. The agglomeration of the slurry particles is significantly reduced in the hydrofluorocarbon. The GPC traces of these isobutylene/isoprene copolymers do not show any sign of gel formation or cross-linking, even for the Example 146 which contains more than 5 mol% isoprene. The high diene isobutylene/isoprene polymers made according to this invention can be halogenated subsequently via standard, established halogenation processes for making halobutyl polymers.<br>
Example 147<br>
[00251]	The   dependence   of   molecular   weight   on   conversion   was<br>
determined for isobutylene/isoprene copolymerizations run in methyl chloride and CF^FCFs at -95Â°C. This dependence was determined for two different initiator/coinitiator systems; one based on TMPC1 and the other based on HC1. Both catalyst systems used EADC as the Lewis acid coinitiator. A three-neck 500 ml glass reactor was used for these examples. Prior to each polymerization, 300 ml of monomer feed containing 10 wt% of the monomers were charged into the chilled reactor. A molar ratio of 95/5 isobutylene/isoprene was used for each polymerization. The initiator/coinitiator molar ratio was controlled at 1/3 and the<br>
concentration was set at 0.1 wt% EADC in MeCl. The initiator/coinitiator solution was added dropwise to the polymerization mixture and the rate of addition is<br>
O<br>
controlled in such as way so that the reactor temperature raise did not exceed 4 C. The amount of initiator/coinitiator solution added in each depended on the desired monomer conversion target. The data for these polymerizations are shown in Figure 3 as a plot of peak molecular weight (Mp) versus the monomer conversion in wt%. The expected decline of molecular weight with increasing conversion is observed. These data also show that HC1 is a preferred initiator for copolymerizations in CF^FCFs.<br>
Example 148<br>
[00252]	A  copolymerization  of isobutylene   and   cyclopentadiene   was<br>
conducted at -93Â°C in CH2FCF3. A molar ratio of 97/3 of isobutylene / cyclopentadiene was used for this polymerization at 10.8 wt% monomers in the feed. Cyclopentadiene was freshly cracked for this experiment. The initiator/coinitiator solution was prepared by dissolving 200 microliters of a 1.0 mol/L solution of hydrogen chloride in CI^FCFs into 50 ml of pre-chilled CF^FCFa. To this solution was added 500 microliters of a 1.0 mol/L solution of ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane. This solution was stirred for 5 minutes. Polymerization was begun by the dropwise addition of the initiator/coinitiator solution into the monomer solution with stirring. The addition of this solution was maintained at a rate necessary to keep the polymerization temperature from rising above -92Â°C. A total of 35 ml of the initiator/coinitiator solution was used. A 500 ml glass resin kettle was used for this example.<br><br>

Solubility of Ethylaluminum Dichloride in Hydrofluorocarbons and Blends<br>
[00253]	The solubility tests reported in Tables 19-25 were performed<br>
using neat ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC). Each test was performed in the following way. 5 ml of the condensed hydrofluorocarbon were charged into a dried test tube cooled to -90Â°C in the dry box cold bath. To this liquid at -90Â°C, 4.1 microliters of neat, liquid ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC) was added. Solubility was checked by vigorously agitating the resulting mixture. The mixture was then allowed to warm to the boiling point of the diluent while agitating the contents of the test tube. After the diluent reached its boiling point, the mixture was cooled to -90Â°C by immersing the test tube into the cold bath. Reported observations were made after the completed heating/cooling cycle. If after this first heat/cool cycle, the catalyst did not dissolve, 0.5 ml of methyl chloride was added. The heat/cool cycle was repeated. Subsequent additions of 0.5 ml of methyl chloride were made following each heat/cool cycle until the EADC was observed to dissolve or a 50/50 V/V blend was achieved. The following observations were made and recorded.<br>

1.0 mol/L stock hydrocarbon solutions of ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC) prepared at room temperature from neat EADC and the hydrocarbon listed in the table. Pentane refers to normal pentane. ULB hexanes refers to an ultra low benzene grade of hexanes, an isomeric mixture, which contains less than 5 ppm benzene. The final 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) solution was prepared by adding the room temperature EADC stock solution, volume listed in the table, to the liquid HFC-134a in a test tube held at -35Â°C. In all cases, an initial solution is obtained which is clear and colorless. The resulting solution was then cooled by immersing the test tube into the dry box cold bath thermostated at -95 Â°C. The cloud point was determined by monitoring the temperature of the liquid with a thermometer and visually determining the onset of cloudiness. The solutions again became clear by allowing the solutions to warm to a temperature above the cloud point. The behavior of the solution around the cloud point was observed for several minutes by repeatedly cooling and warming the solution. This phenomenon was found to be reproducible.<br>

Solubility of Alkoxyaluminum Dichlorides in 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-<br>
[00256]	The solubility tests reported in Table 25  were conducted by<br>
preparing each alkoxyaluminum dichloride in situ. A general procedure follows. A solution of the corresponding alcohol was prepared by adding 0.0001 moles of the alcohol to 10 milliliters of HFC-134a at -30Â°C. To this solution was added 100 microliters of a 1.0 mol/L stock pentane solution of EADC. After this last addition, the HFC-134a solution was shaken periodically over the next five minutes. The solution was allowed to warm to -10Â°C in a closed vessel and then cooled in the dry box cold bath thermostated at -95Â°C. The cloud point was determined by monitoring the temperature of the liquid with a thermometer and visually determining the onset of cloudiness. The solutions again became clear by allowing the solutions to warm to a temperature above the cloud point. The behavior of the solution around the cloud point was observed for several minutes by repeatedly cooling and warming the solution. This phenomenon was found to be reproducible.<br>
