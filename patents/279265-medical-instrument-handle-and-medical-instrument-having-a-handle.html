MEDICAL INSTRUMENT HANDLE<br>
AND MEDICAL INSTRUMENT HAVING A HANDLE<br>
[0001]    Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention is related generally to medical equipment, and<br>
more particularly to a medical instrument handle and to a medical instrument<br>
having a handle.<br>
[0003]    Background of the Invention<br>
[0004]    Endoscopes (including colonoscopes) are known which have an<br>
insertion tube which is insertable within a patient. The insertion tube has an<br>
articulatable distal end portion controlled by wires running from the distal end<br>
portion to control knobs on the handle of the endoscope. A wide angle video<br>
camera in the distal end of the insertion tube permits medical observation.<br>
Medical devices, such as a medical snare, are part of an endoscopic system and<br>
are insertable into the working channel(s) of the insertion tube of the endoscope<br>
and are translatable to extend from the distal end portion for medical treatment.<br>
Other medical devices are known which use a manually-pulled pull wire,<br>
surrounded by a flexible sheath connected to a handle, to articulate an end<br>
effector about a pivot pin.<br>
[0005]    Still, scientists and engineers continue to seek improved medical<br>
instrument handles and improved medical instruments having a handle.<br>
[0006]    Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007]    A first expression of a first embodiment of the invention is for a<br>
medical instrument handle including a stem, a joystick assembly, and a medical-<br>
instrument-member first articulation cable. The stem has a proximal stem<br>
portion and a distal stem portion. The joystick assembly includes platform, a<br>
proximal joystick portion and a distal joystick portion, wherein the distal<br>
joystick portion is articulatably connected to the proximal stem portion. The<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
2<br>
first articulation cable includes a proximal cable portion which is connected to<br>
the platform and which is substantially transversely constrained by the stem.<br>
Articulation of the joystick assembly with respect to the stem changes a distance<br>
between the platform and the stem as measured along the first articulation cable.<br>
[0008]    A second expression of a first embodiment of the invention is for a<br>
medical instrument including a flexible tube, a medical end effector, a medical-<br>
end-effector activation wire, a fitting, a lengthwise-translatable first cable, and a<br>
handle. The tube has a distal tube portion insertable within a patient. The<br>
medical end effector is connected to the distal tube portion. The activation wire<br>
is positioned within the tube. The fitting is spaced apart from, and positioned<br>
proximal to, the medical end effector, wherein the fitting is attached to the tube.<br>
The first cable is positioned outside the tube, is substantially transversely<br>
constrained by the fitting, and has a distal cable portion attached to the medical<br>
end effector. Lengthwise translation of the first cable articulates the medical<br>
end effector with respect to the fitting. The handle includes a stem and a<br>
joystick assembly. The stem has a proximal stem portion and a distal stem<br>
portion. The joystick assembly includes a platform, a proximal joystick portion<br>
and a distal joystick portion, wherein the distal joystick portion is articulatably<br>
connected to the proximal stem portion. The first cable includes a proximal<br>
cable portion which is connected to the platform and which is substantially<br>
transversely constrained by the stem. Articulation of the joystick assembly with<br>
respect to the stem changes a distance between the platform and the stem as<br>
measured along the first cable.<br>
[0009]    A first expression of a second embodiment of the invention is for a<br>
medical instrument including a flexible tube, a coupling, a medical end effector,<br>
an activation wire, a fitting, a lengthwise-translatable first cable, and a handle.<br>
The tube defines a passageway and has a distal tube portion insertable within a<br>
patient. The coupling is connected to the distal tube portion and has a lumen in<br>
communication with the passageway. The medical end effector is positionable<br>
in the lumen of the coupling. The activation wire is positionable in the<br>
passageway and is connected to the medical end effector. The fitting is spaced<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
3<br>
apart from, and positioned proximal to, the coupling, wherein the fitting is<br>
attached to the tube. The first cable is positioned outside the tube, is<br>
substantially transversely constrained by the fitting, and has a distal cable<br>
portion attached to the coupling. Lengthwise translation of the first cable<br>
articulates the coupling with respect to the fitting. The handle includes a stem<br>
and a joystick assembly. The stem has a proximal stem portion and a distal<br>
stem portion. The joystick assembly includes a platform, a proximal joystick<br>
portion and a distal joystick portion, wherein the distal joystick portion is<br>
articulatably connected to the proximal stem portion. The first cable includes a<br>
proximal cable portion which is connected to the platform and which is<br>
substantially transversely constrained by the stem. Articulation of the joystick<br>
assembly with respect to the stem changes a distance between the platform and<br>
the stem as measured along the first cable.<br>
[0010]    Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the<br>
expressions of the embodiments of the invention. In a first example, the<br>
joystick assembly of the medical instrument handle, with multiple cables, offers<br>
intuitive operation of the handle to provide articulation of a medical instrument<br>
member (such as, without limitation, a medical end effector or a coupling<br>
having a lumen in which a medical end effector is positionable) which is not<br>
limited to a single plane.<br>

and description. The illustrative embodiments of the invention may be<br>
implemented or incorporated in other embodiments, variations and<br>
modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways.<br>
Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed<br>
herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative<br>
embodiments of the present invention for the convenience of the reader and are<br>
not for the purpose of limiting the invention.<br>
[0026]    It is understood that any one or more of the following-described<br>
embodiments, examples, etc. can be combined with any one or more of the<br>
other following-described embodiments, examples, etc.<br>
[0027]    Referring now to the Figures, wherein like numerals represent like<br>
elements throughout, Figures 1-9 illustrate a first embodiment of the invention.<br>
A first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-9 is for a medical instrument<br>
handle (also called a handle) 10 including a stem 12, a joystick assembly 14,<br>
and a medical-instrument-member first articulation cable (also called a first<br>
cable) 18. The stem 12 has a proximal stem portion 20 and a distal stem portion<br>
22. The joystick assembly 14 includes a platform 16, a proximal joystick<br>
portion 24 and a distal joystick portion 26, wherein the distal joystick portion 26<br>
is articulatably connected to the proximal stem portion 20. The first articulation<br>
cable 18 includes a proximal cable portion 28 which is connected to the<br>
platform 16 and which is substantially transversely constrained by the stem 12.<br>
Articulation of the joystick assembly 14 with respect to the stem 12 changes a<br>
distance between the platform 16 and the stem 12 as measured along the first<br>
articulation cable 18. It is noted that the term "cable" includes any elongated<br>
member adapted for lengthwise translating a force such as, without limitation, a<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
6<br>
wire such, without limitation, as a wire comprising, consisting essentially of, or<br>
consisting of nitinol.<br>
[0028]    In one enablement of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures<br>
1-9, the joystick assembly 14 has a joystick lumen 30 and the stem 12 has a<br>
stem lumen 32 in communication with the joystick lumen 30. In one variation,<br>
the medical instrument handle also includes a medical-end-effector activation<br>
wire (also called an activation wire) 34 disposed in the joystick lumen 30 and in<br>
the stem lumen 32.<br>
[0029]    In a one extension of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures<br>
1-9, the medical instrument handle 10 also includes a medical-instrument-<br>
member second articulation cable 36 including a proximal cable portion 28<br>
which is connected to the platform 16 and which is substantially transversely<br>
constrained by the stem 12, wherein articulation of the joystick assembly 14<br>
with respect to the stem 12 changes a distance between the platform 16 and the<br>
stem 12 as measured along the second articulation cable 36. In one variation,<br>
the medical instrument handle 10 also includes a medical-instrument-member<br>
third articulation cable 38 including a proximal cable portion 28 which is<br>
connected to the platform 16 and which is substantially transversely constrained<br>
by the stem 12, wherein articulation of the joystick assembly 14 with respect to<br>
the stem 12 changes a distance between the platform 16 and the stem 12 as<br>
measured along the third articulatio cable 38. In one modification, the platform<br>
16 has a longitudinal axis 40, and the proximal cable portions 28 of the first,<br>
second and third articulation cables 18, 36 and 38 are substantially circularly<br>
arrayed 120 degrees apart from each other about the longitudinal axis 40.<br>
[0030]    In a first implementation of the first expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figures 1-9, the distal joystick portion 26 is articulatably connected to the<br>
proximal stem portion 20 with a ball-and-socket attachment 42. In a second<br>
implementation, not shown, the distal joystick portion is articulatably connected<br>
to the proximal stem portion with a universal joint. Single plane, and other<br>
multiple plane, articulatable connections are left to those skilled in the art. In<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
7<br>
one construction, the platform 16 is disposed 16 proximate the distal joystick<br>
portion 26.<br>
[0031]    In one illustration of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures<br>
1-9, the medical instrument handle 10 also includes a first conduit 44 which<br>
surrounds the first articulation cable 18 and which is connected to the platform<br>
16 and to the stem 12. In one variation, the first conduit 44 is a telescoping<br>
conduit. In one example, the first conduit 44 is connected to the platform 16 by<br>
a ball-and-socket connection 46 and to the stem 12 by a ball-and-socket<br>
connection 48.<br>
[0032]    In one configuration of the first expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figures 1-9, the proximal cable portion 28 has a proximal cable end 50, wherein<br>
the first articulation cable 18 has a first distance between the proximal cable end<br>
50 and the platform 16, and the first distance is adjustable. In one variation, an<br>
adjustment nut 52 is threadably attached to the proximal end portion 54 of the<br>
first conduit 44, and the proximal cable end 50 is attached to the adjustment nut<br>
52. In one extension, the medical instrument handle 10 also includes a second<br>
conduit 56 which surrounds the second articulation cable 36 and includes a third<br>
conduit 58 which surrounds the third articulation cable 38 in a like manner as<br>
the first conduit 44 surrounds the first articulation cable 18 and with like<br>
conduit connections and cable length adjustments.<br>
[0033]    A second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-9 is for a medical<br>
instrument 110 including a flexible tube 112, a medical end effector 114, a<br>
medical-end-effector activation wire 34, a fitting 118, a lengthwise translatable<br>
first cable 18, and a handle 10. The flexible tube 112 has a distal tube portion<br>
122 insertable within a patient. The medical end effector 114 is connected to<br>
the distal tube portion 122. The activation wire 34 is disposed within the tube<br>
112. The fitting 118 is spaced apart from, and is disposed proximal to, the<br>
medical end effector 114. The fitting 118 is attached to the tube 112. The first<br>
cable 18 is disposed outside the tube 112, is substantially transversely<br>
constrained by the fitting 118, and has a distal cable portion 124 attached to the<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
8<br>
medical end effector 114. Lengthwise translation of the first cable 18<br>
articulates the medical end effector 114 (which is a medical instrument<br>
member) with respect to the fitting 118. The handle 10 includes a stem 12 and a<br>
joystick assembly 14. The stem 12 has a proximal stem portion 20 and a distal<br>
stem portion 22. The joystick assembly 14 includes a platform 16, a proximal<br>
joystick portion 24 and a distal joystick portion 26, wherein the distal joystick<br>
portion 26 is articulatably connected to the proximal stem portion 20. The first<br>
cable 18 includes a proximal cable portion 28 which is connected to the<br>
platform 16 and which is substantially transversely constrained by the stem 12.<br>
Articulation of the joystick assembly 14 with respect to the stem 12 changes a<br>
distance between the platform 16 and the stem 12 as measured along the first<br>
cable 18. It is noted that such articulation of the joystick assembly 14 results in<br>
articulation of the medical end effector 114 with respect to the fitting 118.<br>
[0034]    It is noted that an example of a tubular assembly 100 extending from<br>
the stem 12 to the fitting 118 is shown in figure 1, such tubular assembly 100<br>
being shown in more detail in Figure 8 wherein it is understood that in Figure 8<br>
the pipes (such as the first pipe 126) would extend to the stem 12.<br>
[0035]    In one enablement of the second expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figures 1-9, the joystick assembly 14 has a joystick lumen 30 and the stem 12<br>
has a stem lumen 32 in communication with the joystick lumen 30. In one<br>
variation, the activation wire 34 is disposed in the joystick lumen 30 and in the<br>
stem lumen 32.<br>
[0036]    In a first extension of the second expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figures 1-9, the medical instrument 110 also includes a lengthwise translatable<br>
second cable 36 disposed outside the tube 112, substantially transversely<br>
constrained by the fitting 118, and having a distal cable portion 138 attached to<br>
the medical end effector 114. Lengthwise translation of the second cable 36<br>
articulates the medical end effector 114 with respect to the fitting 118. The<br>
second cable 36 includes a proximal cable portion 28 which is connected to the<br>
platform 16 and which is substantially transversely constrained by the stem 12.<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
9<br>
Articulation of the joystick assembly 14 with respect to the stem 12 changes a<br>
distance between the platform 16 and the stem 12 as measured along the second<br>
cable 36. In one variation, the medical instrument 110 also includes a<br>
lengthwise translatable third cable 38 disposed outside the tube 112,<br>
substantially transversely constrained by the fitting 118, and having a distal<br>
cable portion 138 attached to the medical end effector 114. Lengthwise<br>
translation of the third cable 38 articulates the medical end effector 114 with<br>
respect to the fitting 118. The third cable 38 includes a proximal cable portion<br>
28 which is connected to the platform 16 and which is substantially transversely<br>
constrained by the stem 12. Articulation of the joystick assembly 14 with<br>
respect to the stem 12 changes a distance between the platform 16 and the stem<br>
12 as measured along the third cable 38. In one modification, the platform 16<br>
has a longitudinal axis 40, and the proximal cable portions 28 of the first,<br>
second and third cables 18, 36 and 38 are substantially circularly arrayed 120<br>
degrees apart from each other about the longitudinal axis 40.<br>
[0037]    In one implementation of the second expression of the first<br>
embodiment of Figures 1-9, the medical instrument 110 also includes a flexible<br>
first pipe 126 surrounding the first cable 18 and attached to the fitting 118. In<br>
one variation, the first pipe 126 does not extend distally of the fitting 118. In<br>
the same or a different variation, the first pipe 126 is a first coil pipe. In the<br>
same or a different variation, the fitting 118 has a longitudinal axis 128, and the<br>
tube 112 is substantially coaxially aligned with the longitudinal axis 128 within<br>
the fitting 118. In one modification, the fitting 118 has a longitudinally-<br>
extending circumferential surface 130, and the first pipe 126 is disposed in a<br>
surface groove 132 (three grooves are shown in Figure 8 and one groove is<br>
shown in Figure 9) of the circumferential surface 130 of the fitting 118. In one<br>
example, the tube 112 is a coil-pipe tube. In a first employment, adjacent coil<br>
turns of a coil pipe are in contact with each other. In a second employment,<br>
adjacent coil turns of a coil pipe are spaced apart from each other.<br>
[0038] In a first construction of the second expression of the first embodiment<br>
of Figures 1-9, the medical end effector 114 has a proximal end-effector portion<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
10<br>
134, and the first cable 18 is attached to the proximal end-effector portion 134<br>
of the medical end effector 114. In one variation, the fitting 118 has a first<br>
diameter, and the proximal end-effector portion 134 has a second diameter<br>
which is substantially equal to the first diameter. In the same or a different<br>
variation, the tube 112 has a diameter which is smaller than the first diameter<br>
distal of the fitting 118.<br>
[0039]    Examples, without limitation, of medical end effectors 114 of the<br>
second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-9, include a medical grasper<br>
(as shown in Figures 1 and 8) and include medical forceps (not shown). Other<br>
examples are left to the artisan. In the example of the medical grasper, the<br>
distal end of the activation wire 34 is operatively connected to the jaw opening<br>
and closing mechanism of the medical grasper as is well known in the art. In<br>
one variation, the handle 10 includes a knob 60 attached to the proximal end of<br>
the activation wire 34, wherein the knob 60 surrounds, and is slidably mounted<br>
on, the joystick 14, and wherein sliding the knob 60 opens and closes the jaws<br>
of the medical grasper.<br>
[0040]    Referring again to the Figures, Figures 10-12 illustrate a second<br>
embodiment of the invention, wherein the embodiment of the handle 10 of<br>
Figure 10 is illustrated in more detail in Figures 2-7. A first expression of the<br>
embodiment of Figures 10-12 and 2-7 is for a medical instrument 210 including<br>
a flexible tube 212, a coupling 213, a medical end effector 214, an activation<br>
wire 34, a fitting 218, a lengthwise translatable first cable 18, and a handle 10.<br>
The flexible tube 212 defines a passageway 221 and has a distal tube portion<br>
222 insertable within a patient. The coupling 213 is connected to the distal tube<br>
portion 222 and has a lumen 223 in communication with the passageway 221.<br>
The medical end effector 214 is disposable in the lumen 223 of the coupling<br>
213. The activation wire 34 is disposable in the passageway 221 and connected<br>
to the medical end effector 214. The fitting 218 is spaced apart from, and is<br>
disposed proximal to, the coupling 213. The fitting 218 is attached to the tube<br>
212. The first cable 18 is disposed outside the tube 212, is substantially<br>
transversely constrained by the fitting 218, and has a distal cable portion 224<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
11<br>
connected to the coupling 213. Lengthwise translation of the first cable 18<br>
articulates the coupling 213 (which is a medical instrument member) with<br>
respect to the fitting 218. The handle 10 includes a stem 12 and a joystick<br>
assembly 14. The stem 12 has a proximal stem portion 20 and a distal stem<br>
portion 22. The joystick assembly 14 includes a platform 16, a proximal<br>
joystick portion 24 and a distal joystick portion 26, wherein the distal joystick<br>
portion 26 is articulatably connected to the proximal stem portion 20. The first<br>
cable 18 includes a proximal cable portion 28 which is connected to the<br>
platform 16 and which is substantially transversely constrained by the stem 12.<br>
Articulation of the joystick assembly 14 with respect to the stem 12 changes a<br>
distance 18 between the platform 16 and the stem 12 as measured along the first<br>
cable 18. It is noted that such articulation of the joystick assembly 14 results in<br>
articulation of the coupling 213 with respect to the fitting 218.<br>
[0041]    It is noted that an example of a tubular assembly 200 extending from<br>
the stem 12 to the fitting 218 is shown in figure 10, such tubular assembly 200<br>
being shown in more detail in Figure 11 wherein it is understood that in Figure<br>
11 the pipes (such as the first pipe 226) would extend to the stem 12.<br>
[0042]    In one enablement of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures<br>
10-12 and 2-7, the joystick assembly 14 has a joystick lumen 30 and the stem 12<br>
has a stem lumen 32 in communication with the joystick lumen 30. In one<br>
variation, the activation wire 34 is disposed in the joystick lumen 30 and in the<br>
stem lumen 32.<br>
[0043]    In a first extension of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures<br>
10-12 and 2-7, the medical instrument 210 also includes a lengthwise<br>
translatable second cable 36 disposed outside the tube 212, substantially<br>
transversely constrained by the fitting 218, and having a distal cable portion 238<br>
attached to the coupling 213. Lengthwise translation of the second cable 36<br>
articulates the coupling 213 with respect to the fitting 118. The second cable 36<br>
includes a proximal cable portion 28 which is connected to the platform 16 and<br>
which is substantially transversely constrained by the stem 12. Articulation of<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
12<br>
the joystick assembly 14 with respect to the stem 12 changes a distance between<br>
the platform 16 and the stem 12 as measured along the second cable 36. In one<br>
variation, the medical instrument 210 also includes a lengthwise translatable<br>
third cable 38 disposed outside the tube 212, substantially transversely<br>
constrained by the fitting 218, and having a distal cable portion 238 attached to<br>
the coupling 213. Lengthwise translation of the third cable 38 articulates the<br>
coupling 213 with respect to the fitting 218. The third cable 38 includes a<br>
proximal cable portion 28 which is connected to the platform 16 and which is<br>
substantially transversely constrained by the stem 12. Articulation of the<br>
joystick assembly 14 with respect to the stem 12 changes a distance between the<br>
platform 16 and the stem 12 as measured along the third cable 38. In one<br>
modification, the platform 16 has a longitudinal axis 40, and the proximal cable<br>
portions 28 of the first, second and third cables 18, 36 and 38 are substantially<br>
circularly arrayed 120 degrees apart from each other about the longitudinal axis<br>
40.<br>
[0044]    In one implementation of the first expression of the second<br>
embodiment of Figures 10-12 and 2-7, the medical instrument 210 also includes<br>
a flexible first pipe 226 surrounding the first cable 18 and attached to the fitting<br>
218, wherein the fitting 218 has a longitudinally-extending circumferential<br>
surface 230, wherein the first pipe 226 is disposed in a surface groove 232<br>
(three grooves are shown in Figure 11) of the circumferential surface 230 of the<br>
fitting 218, and wherein the first pipe 226 does not extend distally of the fitting<br>
218. In one variation, the first pipe 226 is a first coil pipe. In one example, the<br>
tube 212 is a coil-pipe tube. In one employment, the activation wire 34 is<br>
monolithically connected to the medical end effector 214. Thus, in this<br>
employment, the activation wire 34 and the medical end effector 214 are two<br>
portions of one continuous piece.<br>
[0045]    Examples, without limitation, of medical end effectors 214 of the first<br>
expression of the embodiment of Figures 10-12 and 2-7, include a medical snare<br>
(as shown in Figures 10-12) and include an electrocautery needle knife (not<br>
shown). Other examples are left to the artisan. In one example employing the<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
13<br>
medical snare, the first cable 18 articulates the coupling 213 to a desired<br>
orientation, the activation wire 216 is pushed to extend the medical snare out of<br>
the distal end of the coupling 213 and around patient tissue (such as a polyp),<br>
and the activation wire 34 is then pulled to excise the polyp and retract the<br>
medical snare (and polyp) into the distal end of the coupling 213. In one<br>
configuration, the medical instrument 210 includes a second cable 36 and a<br>
third cable 38 as shown in Figure 11. In one variation, the handle 10 includes a<br>
knob 60 attached to the proximal end of the activation wire 34, wherein the<br>
knob 60 surrounds, and is slidably mounted on, the joystick 14, and wherein<br>
sliding the knob 60 extends and retracts the snare.<br>
[0046]    In a third embodiment, not shown, the medical instrument handle 10 is<br>
operatively connected to a medical cannula having a first medical cannula tube,<br>
a second medical cannula tube, and a resiliently bendable coil spring. The first<br>
medical cannula tube has a distal end portion insertable within a patient. The<br>
second medical cannula tube is entirely insertable within the patient and is<br>
spaced apart from the first medical cannula tube. The coil spring connects the<br>
first medical cannula tube to the second medical cannula tube. The medical-<br>
instrument-member first articulation cable 18 is located in the first medical<br>
cannula tube, has a distal end portion extending from the first medical cannula<br>
tube and attached to the second medical cannula tube, and is movable to<br>
articulate the second medical cannula tube with respect to the first medical<br>
cannula tube. In one example, the first medical cannula tube is an endoscope<br>
end cap which is attachable to the distal end of a flexible insertion tube of an<br>
endoscope, wherein the second medical cannula tube can be articulated with<br>
respect to the first medical cannula tube (and hence with respect to the insertion<br>
tube of the endoscope) allowing independent alignment of a wide angle video<br>
camera of the endoscope and a medical instrument carried in the second medical<br>
cannula tube. In a second example, the first medical cannula tube has a<br>
cannula-tube-to-endoscope-rail coupling feature allowing the first medical<br>
cannula tube to be coupled to, and slid along, an exterior rail of a flexible<br>
insertion tube of an endoscope which also allows independent alignment of a<br>
END-5817USNP<br>
 <br>
14<br>
wide angle video camera of the endoscope and a medical instrument carried in<br>
the second medical cannula tube. Other examples are left to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
[0047]    Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the<br>
expressions of the embodiments of the invention. In a first example, the<br>
joystick assembly of the medical instrument handle, with multiple cables, offers<br>
intuitive operation of the handle to provide articulation of a medical instrument<br>
member (such as, without limitation, a medical end effector or a coupling<br>
having a lumen in which a medical end effector is positionable) which is not<br>
limited to a single plane.<br>
[0048]    While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of<br>
several expressions of embodiments, it is not the intention of the applicants to<br>
restrict or limit the spirit and scope of the appended claims to such detail.<br>
Numerous other variations, changes, and substitutions will occur to those skilled<br>
in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. It will be<br>
understood that the foregoing description is provided by way of example, and<br>
that other modifications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing<br>
from the scope and spirit of the appended Claims.<br>
