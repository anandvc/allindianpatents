				<td>Diamond particle abrasive and method for the production of the same<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a diamond particle abrasive and a method for the<br>
production of the same, suitable in particular for the use in the precision machining and<br>
polishing of works of such hard materials as carbide alloy, alumina and silicon carbide,<br>
as well as silicon metal and glass fibers.<br>
Technical Background<br>
Recent advance in machining precision is remarkable. Dicing saws are now<br>
common, for example, that have a blade width of as thin as around 30 mm for cutting<br>
silicon wafers and needs are rising for a particle abrasive of improved performance both<br>
in precision and productivity, which would permit a higher precision finish at a higher<br>
efficiency.<br>
In general the abrasive of micron-sized diamond particles are used in two ways:<br>
fixed in a tool such as wheels and blades or, alternatively, dispersed and suspended in<br>
medium as slurry. Recently an increasing part of diamond particles produced is<br>
directed to the application as a fixed abrasive, in order to consume the particles most<br>
usefully.<br>
In machining process diamond particle abrasives are demanded of, first, a high<br>
machining rate, or efficient stock removal per time, and then smooth worked surface. In<br>
general those are the demands that can be very hardly achieved simultaneously.<br>
In such circumstances the polycrystalline type abrasive is considered favorable for<br>
high precision machining processes, which consists of primary diamond particles of<br>
tens of nanometers in diameter aggregated into secondary particles of several<br>
micrometers in diameter.<br>
However this type of abrasive is disadvantageous in that its production is based on<br>
a dynamic compression that uses much explosive under a lot of requirements and<br>
restrictions, so the resulting product is rather too expensive to be used for common<br>
applications.<br>
It is known, on the other hand, that in abrasive applications mesh-sized diamond<br>
particles, when thermally affected, decrease more in mechanical strength than other<br>
abrasive materials. Such alteration is attributed to the occurrence of micro-cracking,<br>
or fine cracks occurring within the particles. So thermal toughness index or<br>
as-thermally-affected strength is employed for the characterization of the particles,<br>
along with the standard properties such as friability and crushing strength. A<br>
technique is also published in a Japanese patent application for the manufacture of<br>
wheels with thermally affected superabrasive particles (JP-A1-2000-158347).<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The principle objects of the invention are to provide an abrasive, and an effective<br>
method for its production, that would meet the above described two demands. The<br>
minute single crystalline diamond particles of the invention, deriving from a diamond<br>
product produced in a common static high-pressure compression, permit high<br>
machining rate, or efficient stock removal per time, and low worked surface roughness<br>
at the same time.<br>
The diamond abrasive of the invention is in the form of sized loose mass of<br>
minute single crystalline particles, which has a D50 average particle size over 5 /urn but<br>
not exceeding 40 mm (as observed with MICROTRAC UPA particle size analyzer). It<br>
has, in addition, a noticeable effect in individual crystal structure and/or collective<br>
property of the mass, as a result of a preceding heat treatment. Such particles are<br>
coated on the surface with non-diamond carbon that amounts 0.5 % or more by weight<br>
relative to the whole diamond.<br>
The diamond abrasive of the invention can be effectively produced by this method,<br>
which consists another aspect of the invention: diamond particles with a D50 average<br>
size within such range are heat-treated at a treatment temperature of 600° C or more in a<br>
non-oxidizing environment, in order to partly convert the surface to non-diamond<br>
carbon.<br>
Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
For the process of the invention a starting material is available above all such as<br>
diamond particles converted from non-diamond carbon on a so-called "static"<br>
high-pressure compression mechanism such as press, isolated, crushed and sorted into<br>
sizes within the range.<br>
The starting material diamond is treated in a non-oxidizing environment and, in<br>
particular, in a vacuum at a pressure of less than 10 Pa for example. Alternatively the<br>
treatment chamber may be degassed and then filled to provide an atmosphere of inert<br>
gas based on nitrogen, argon or helium. The atmosphere may also be reductive instead,<br>
using hydrogen or carbon monoxide. A secure and economic process can be achieved<br>
by filling the chamber with argon or nitrogen gas at a somewhat positive pressure over<br>
the outside atmosphere.<br>
The effect of the heat treatment becomes significant at a temperature up from 600°<br>
C. However a temperature over 1500° C is not favorable, as leading to excessive<br>
conversion to non-diamond carbon and, in particular, graphite. Preferred temperatures<br>
are within a range of 900° to 1400° C. Good results are obtained in terms of both<br>
stock removal and worked surface roughness by the heat treatment at especially 1100°<br>
to 1300° C. The temperature should be maintained for a period that depends on the<br>
volume of the batch treated, in general between 3 and 48 hours.<br>
In the invention, as described above, the abrasive characteristics of diamond is<br>
essentially regulated in the heat treatment, whereby a diamond is partly converted on<br>
the surface to non-diamond carbon, such as graphitic, turbostratic or amorphous carbon.<br>
The proportion of non-diamond carbon should be 30 % or less relative to the whole<br>
diamond weight, as evaluated by weight loss dissolution into oxidizer solution.<br>
The diamond abrasive of the invention yields smoother worked surface relative to<br>
conventional abrasive products of corresponding particle sizes. This is probably<br>
because the deposit of non-diamond carbon, and especially graphitic amorphous carbon,<br>
serves as a lubricating and shock-absorbing medium when the particles hit the work.<br>
The heat-treated diamond particles of the invention also comprise within the<br>
crystal minute cracks as a result of the treatment. This may be caused by volume<br>
expansion that occurs in the conversion in part of the diamond to graphite or another<br>
type of non-diamond carbon, which can be promoted under the presence of metallic<br>
inclusion in molecules or atoms.<br>
The heat-treated diamond particles have a crushing strength decreased by more<br>
than 10 % from the one before the treatment, because of either the above said minute<br>
cracks or unnoticeable structural alteration. That results in chipping or breakage in<br>
small areas and zones around the hitting edges, when loaded of an impulsive force.<br>
This is another feature that permits to effectively prevent or minimize the occurrence of<br>
deep abrasion marks on the work surface, in common with the first feature of the<br>
secondary particle (or polycrystalline) structure composed of finer diamond particles.<br>
Also diamond fragments can polish effectively and contribute to the production of<br>
smoother worked surface with decreased roughness.<br>
Further a spontaneous generation of sharp edges continues by timely chipping on<br>
the particle surface, so as to perform a sustained efficient abrasion or, in other words,<br>
improved machining rate (stock removal per process time and abrasive consumption).<br>
It is known that non-diamond carbon deposited on the surface of diamond<br>
particles can be evaluated commonly by means of wet or dry oxidization process.<br>
Non-diamond carbon in a sample is decomposed and removed selectively from the<br>
diamond, based on the difference in chemical reactivity, and the weight loss caused by<br>
the oxidization is indicated in ratio relative to the weight before the process.<br>
In the wet process a sample is intensely heated in wet oxidizer or a solution of<br>
strong acid such as concentric sulfuric or nitric acid, their mixture, or chromic acid<br>
mixture. As non-diamond carbon has been completely removed from the surface and<br>
in cracks open to the surface, its proportion can be calculated conveniently on the basis<br>
of the difference in weight between after and before the oxidization process. In the<br>
invention the proportion of non-diamond carbon is determined and indicated in<br>
accordance with this technique of dissolution into oxidizer.<br>
This technique of wet oxidization is also applicable, by moderating the process<br>
effect, for imparting hydrophilicity to the surface of particles of either diamond or<br>
combined body of diamond and non-diamond carbon, as heat-treated. Such step of<br>
providing hydrophilicity consists in part a variation of the invention. The term<br>
"moderate" or "mild" is used in this description in the sense that the degree of<br>
oxidization is lowered or moderated.<br>
The improvement in friability due to the minute cracking within the particles can<br>
be first- hand evaluated for coarser particles. The technique called "pot mill" uses a<br>
specialized set of capsule and steel ball. A dose of sample diamond particles,<br>
sieve-sized in advance, is placed in said capsule and subjected to an impulsive loading<br>
for a given period of time. The sample is then collected and sieved again. The<br>
through fraction is weighed and the proportion relative to the initial sample is used to<br>
characterize the friability. Such technique is described in particular in "Diamond<br>
Tools" (Nikkei Gijutsu Tosho), page 238 (1987).<br>
Alternatively, the parameter "toughness index", or shortly T.I., is also used, which<br>
is defined as a ratio in weight, relative to the initial sample of the stronger or tougher<br>
fraction that rests on the screen substantially uncrushed.<br>
The heat-treated diamond particles of the invention have a crushing strength,<br>
evaluated as above, decreased and, thus, improved in friability by 10 % or more. This<br>
is probably an effect of minute cracking that occurs as a result of the heat treatment.<br>
The diamond particles of the invention, as specifically heat-treated, are adapted<br>
and better efficiency can be achieved especially in the machining of carbide alloys,<br>
alumina, silicon carbide and silicon metal, as well as glass fibers. Such effects, it is<br>
considered, may be principally attributed to the improved friability, that is capability of<br>
being crushed under abrasive loads, improved due to the heat treatment. More<br>
specifically fresh edges, small and abundant, are generated effectively when the<br>
particles become crushed during the machining process. Although the increased<br>
friability may affect the tool service life, that is not significant in the whole process<br>
economy. Each diamond particle is more fully exploited in the cycle of edge dulling<br>
and regeneration before it becomes removed, so less proportion drop out of the tool<br>
body as dulled after having served insufficiently. Instead a more apparent effect is<br>
improvement in the productivity in terms of machining rate per process time, due to the<br>
specific free-cutting capability.<br>
On the other hand diamond abrasive, as heat-treated, of the invention yields a<br>
worked surface roughness 80 % that achievable with the diamond abrasive of the same<br>
grade in starting condition (not heat-treated). This is due to the efficient generation of<br>
minute edges by micro cracking, which is an another effect of the heat treatment. This<br>
way a further higher machining efficiency can be achieved by employing a diamond<br>
abrasive of one size-grade larger than conventionally, in uses where usual surface<br>
roughness is allowed.<br>
In the invention the heat treatment is carried out in a non-oxidizing environment,<br>
which may be a vacuum at a pressure of 10 Pa or less, or an atmosphere of inert gas<br>
based on nitrogen, argon or helium or reductive gas such as hydrogen or carbon<br>
monoxide. Oxygen should be avoided as promoting the conversion of diamond to<br>
non-diamond carbon, and kept off from the heat treatment process.<br>
The heat treatment of the invention may reduce the transparency (clearness) of the<br>
crystal and, sometimes, even yield dark spots in the diamond particle for coarser sizes.<br>
They should be probably related to the occurrence of micro cracks or graphite having<br>
formed within the crystal in a conversion that is promoted in the presence of metallic<br>
inclusion. Also the diamond crystals become less lustrous with gray to black surfaces,<br>
where non-diamond carbon deposits, which comprises principally graphite as detected<br>
by X-ray diffraction. The proportion of non-diamond carbon can be considered as<br>
convenient for representing the carbonization degree and introduced as a parameter for<br>
the process control of heat treatment.<br>
The carbonization degree, that is proportion of non-diamond carbon formed by<br>
and during the heat treatment on diamond particles, should be preferably between 0.5<br>
and 30 % by weight. A degree less than 0.5 % is insufficient for absorbing the<br>
impulsive load or decreasing the projection heights as described below, while a 30 % or<br>
more non-diamond carbon deposit is excessively thick and decreases the abrasive<br>
efficiency.<br>
The heat-treated diamond particles are especially adapted for a high precision<br>
cutting or polishing of works of hard substances. Conventional, or not heat-treated,<br>
diamond abrasive would yield chipping in cutting applications, or leave rather deep<br>
abrasion marks on the work surface in the polishing process, because of too high an<br>
intensity at which the abrasive particles hit the work surface. Such work damage can<br>
be significantly reduced with the diamond abrasive of the invention, in contrast. The<br>
specific proportion of non-diamond carbon deposit that intervenes between the diamond<br>
particles and the work surface moderates the load of hitting during either cutting or<br>
polishing process, while the height of the edge projections is also effectively reduced.<br>
In addition the diamond particles, due to the increased friability, become crushed under<br>
excessive loading to absorb the shock and further to spontaneously and timely<br>
regenerate minute cutting edges that enable a sustained precision machining.<br>
The diamond particles as heat-treated, have a surface deposited with non-diamond<br>
carbon and further some carbon atoms on the surface are stabilized as terminated with<br>
hydrogen, so the particles as a whole show a decreased wettability to aqueous<br>
dispersion medium, down from the state before the treatment. Thus it is useful for the<br>
use as aqueous slurry to remove in part the deposit of non-diamond carbon and further<br>
to impart hydrophilicity to the surface of as heat-treated diamond particles, in order to<br>
achieve an improved dispersion.<br>
For this objective, as heat-treated diamond may be subjected to a mild oxidization<br>
process in a bath of oxidizer. For this process, and also the evaluation of carbonization<br>
degree, available is strong acid or wet oxidizer, which is composed on the basis of one<br>
or more selected from such acid as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), perchloric<br>
acid (HCIO4). A typical process is heating at 120° C in a mixture of concentric<br>
sulfuric acid and concentric nitric acid, for example.<br>
Such bath may further comprise potassium nitrate (KNO3) and/or potassium<br>
permanganate (KMnO4).<br>
The bath temperature should be at least 100° C but not exceed 200° C, and<br>
preferably between 120° and 150° C.<br>
This treatment removes in part the non-diamond carbon on the particle surface<br>
and further provides there either hydrophilic atom such as oxygen, or hydrophilic<br>
atomic group such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, or carbonyl, so that hydrophilicity is<br>
imparted.<br>
Here the wording "mild (oxidation)" is employed for the purpose of designating<br>
the above described hydrophilicity-directed process, distinguishably from the similar<br>
process whereby concentrated corresponding acids are used for determining the content<br>
of non-diamond carbon by the intense, complete removal from the given sample.<br>
The hydrophilic atom and group can be provided on the diamond by first<br>
halogenizing and then hydrolyzing its outer surface. For example a mass of as<br>
heat-treated diamond particles is placed in a chamber and heated at 300° C and chlorine<br>
gas is passed over said particles to halogenize the surface. The particles then are<br>
placed in water and collected with hydrophilic atoms or groups attached to the surface.<br>
Another technique available for imparting hydrophilicity is based on a dry process<br>
of surface oxidization, whereby as heat-treated diamond powder is heated in an<br>
oxygen-containing gas or vapor. For this purpose the atmosphere may comprise air,<br>
oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapor (steam) to join the hydrophilic atoms of oxygen<br>
to the surface of diamond particles. In the case of air, for example, suitable<br>
temperatures range from 450° to 500° C for an average size of 40 mm and 350° to 400°<br>
C for an average size of 6 jum, while temperatures lower by about 50° are suitable in the<br>
case of oxygen.<br>
Example 1<br>
Tomei Diamond's IRM 4-8 micron-size diamond (D50 average size being 5.10 <br>
mm) powder was used as a starting material and treated by placing in a ceramic crucible<br>
and heating to either 600° or 800° C in a vacuum of 10 Pa for 3 hours.<br>
The powder, which had a light grayish color when taken out from the chamber,<br>
was subjected to a wet oxidization by heating in a boiling mixture of sulfuric and nitric<br>
acid, in order to evaluate the non-diamond carbon deposit on the surface. A<br>
calculation based on the weight loss thus caused gave an estimation of 0.5 % and 0.8 %<br>
non-diamond carbon for the samples of 600° and 800° C, respectively.<br>
1 weight % aqueous slurry was prepared by using either hydrophilicity treated<br>
diamond and untreated control diamond. Each slurry was tested in the polishing of a<br>
nickel disk of 3.5-inch (89 mm) diameter. The results were a polishing rate of 6.1<br>
mg/min. with 600° heated, 6.4 mg/min. with 800° heated, and 4.8 mg/min. with<br>
untreated diamond. That is an improvement of 24 % or 30 % was achieved in<br>
machining (polishing) efficiency by subjecting the diamond to the heat treatment of the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
Similarly to the preceding example, IRM 4-8 micron-size diamond (D50 average<br>
size being 5.10 mm) was used as a starting material, which was placed in an alumina<br>
crucible and heated in nitrogen at a temperature of 1250° C for 3 hours. The diamond<br>
as taken out of the crucible had a dark gray color, which was then subjected to the wet<br>
oxidization process. Treated in a boiling mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid, the<br>
resulting loss in weight gave an estimation of 5.3 % for the non-diamond deposit on the<br>
diamond surface.<br>
1 weight % aqueous slurry was prepared by using heat treated-diamond and, for<br>
the purpose of comparison, untreated control diamond, and tested in the polishing of a<br>
silicon disk of 4-inch (101.6 mm) diameter. The results achieved were a polishing rate<br>
of 5.1 mg/min with the diamond of the invention, as compared with 4.8 mg/min. with<br>
the control abrasive. The worked surface roughness, in terms of Ra, was of 28 A with<br>
the treated diamond, as compared with 46 A with the untreated diamond. Here the<br>
treatment of the invention achieved an improvement of 33 % in work surface roughness.<br>
Each slurry was further tested in the lapping of a 20 mm diameter round rod of JIS<br>
K-10 carbide alloy. A stock removal, in terms of thickness reduction in 10 minutes, of<br>
11.2 mm was achieved with the heat-treated diamond and 8.5 mm with the untreated<br>
control.<br>
Example 3<br>
Tomei Diamond's IMM 40-60 (D50 average size being 37 mm) micron size<br>
diamond as a starting material, which was placed in a graphite crucible and heat-treated<br>
at 1350° C in hydrogen for 3 hours. The light yellow diamond grew to gray over the<br>
treatment. The non-diamond carbon deposit on the diamond was removed in a boiling<br>
mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid, and its proportion was estimated as 11 % on the basis<br>
of the weight loss.<br>
The treated diamond of the invention and untreated control diamond were each<br>
tested for friability. Also straight type wheels were prepared by using the both<br>
diamonds, bonded with phenolic resin, and tested for comparative achievement in the<br>
polishing of carbide alloy work. The results are shown in the table below.<br>

minute diamond particles for abrasive uses, which is prepared from a coarser crystalline<br>
product of a common static ultra high-pressure process. The novel particle abrasive<br>
can achieve improvement in both machining efficiency (stock removal per time) and<br>
worked surface roughness. An effective method for its production is also provided.<br>
The diamond particles of the invention, which have a D50 average size of over 5<br>
mm but not exceeding 40 mm, have an explicit effect of a heat treament on either crystal<br>
structure or collective properties. The particles are further deposited on the surface<br>
with non-diamond carbon, amounting 0.5 % or more by weight in relation to the<br>
diamond as a whole.<br>
Such diamond particles can be effectively obtained by heating diamond particles<br>
having said D50 particle size, in a non-oxidizing environment at a treatment<br>
temperature of 600° C, in order to convert the surface of diamond particle to<br>
non-diamond carbon.</td>
