				<td>HIGH DS CATIONIC POLYGALACTOMANNAN<br>
FOR SKINCARE PRODUCTS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/613,007, filed September 24, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a skin care composition and, more<br>
particularly, to a skin cleansing, protecting, moisturizing, firming, conditioning,<br>
occlusive barrier, and emolliency composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, body washes were not only expected to cleanse the body<br>
but also to provide conditioning characteristics. It is well known in the personal<br>
care industry to formulate products that provide both cleansing and moisturizing<br>
benefits. Many polysaccharides are used as rheology modifiers for skin care<br>
products. Cellulose ethers and polygalactomannan and polygalactomannan<br>
derivative products are among the best known polysaccharides for use as<br>
rheology modifiers.<br>
Cationically derivatized cellulosics and polygalactomannan derivatives are<br>
used as a conditioning agent for hair and skin. Cellulosics and<br>
polygalactomannan polymers without a cationic group(s) are not used as<br>
conditioning agents but rather are used only as a rheology modifier. Most of the<br>
commercial cationic polygalactomannans, such as cationic guar produces, have<br>
cationic degree of substitution (DS) of less than 0.20. Because of<br>
manufacturing process related issues* only cationic guar with DS of less than 0.2<br>
is commercially available from raw material suppliers, such as Hercules<br>
Incorporated that markets its products under the trademark N-Hance® and<br>
Rhodia Corporation that markets its products under the trademarks Jaguar® and<br>
Excel®. It is also know in the personal care industry that levels of cationic DS on<br>
a polygalactomannan do affect performance of cationic guar in skin care<br>
compositions, such as body cleansing and conditioning. The higher the cationic<br>
DS, the better the conditioning effect is expected to be at the same use level of<br>
the low DS cationic guar. In addition, because of the low DS of the commercial<br>
polymers, they are less soluble in water and, therefore, also impact viscosity of<br>
the body washes significantly if attempts are made to use higher levels. There<br>
are several prior art references that disclose the use of cationic<br>
polgalactomannans in personal care products.<br>
US Patent Application publication 20030199403 A1 discloses a shampoo<br>
containing a cationic guar derivative having a high degree of substitution.<br>
US Patent Application publication 2003/0108507 A1 discloses a hair<br>
conditioning shampoo composition of surfactants and cationic polymers.<br>
US Patent Application publication 2004/0157754 A1 discloses a shampoo<br>
composition with a conditioning agent and a cationic polymer with a high charge<br>
density.<br>
US Patent Application publication 2003/0202952 A1 discloses a shampoo<br>
composition with an anti-dandruff agent and a cationic polysaccharide.<br>
US Patent Application publication 2003/0215522 A1 discloses a personal<br>
care composition and a zinc anti-dandruff agent and a cationic polymer.<br>
Notwithstanding the prior art, a need still exists in the marketplace for skin<br>
care compositions containing cationic polygalactomannans wherein the<br>
composition provides better protection to the skin and has significantly improved<br>
stability as compared to similar prior art compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a skin care composition of a) from<br>
about 1 to about 90 wt % of a surfactant, b) at least about 0.05 wt % of a cationic<br>
polymer wherein i) the cationic polymer has a weight average molecular weight<br>
(Mw) from about 2,000 to about 10,000,000 Dalton and ii) the cationic polymer<br>
has a degree of substitution (DS) lower limit of 0.25 and has an upper limit of<br>
3.0, and c) at least one skin care active ingredient. The SKin care composition<br>
provides protection to the skin. The protection includes cleansing, moisturizing,<br>
firming, depositing, conditioning, occlusive barrier, anti-wrinkling, and emolliency<br>
to the skin.<br>
Examples of the skin care active ingredient materials are UV absorbers,<br>
sun screen agents, moisturizers, humectants, occlusive agents, moisture<br>
barriers, lubricants, emollients, anti-aging agents, antistatic agents, secondary<br>
conditioners, exfolliants, lustering agents, tanning agents, luminescents, colors,<br>
anti-odorizing agents, fragrances, viscosifying agent, salts, lipids, phospholipids,<br>
hydrophobic plant extracts, vitamins,, silicone oils, silicone derivatives, essential<br>
oils, oils, fats, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, waxes, polyols,<br>
hydrocarbons, and mixture thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the using of cationic guar polymers<br>
having a DS &gt; 0.2 provided to skin care products improved protection and<br>
greater stability for longer shelf life as compared to similar prior art products.<br>
These polymers are significantly lower in aqueous viscosity as compared to<br>
cationic guar polymers with DS 
Aqualon Co.) and Jaguar products (marketed by Rhodia Corp.). Because of the<br>
higher DS and lower viscosity that the polymers of the present invention have,<br>
they can be used at much higher levels in skin care formulations such as body<br>
wash in order to provide skin conditioning and moisturizing. In addition, they<br>
provide better salt tolerance than the counterpart guar products with low DS.<br>
Other applications for the cationic guar polymers of the present invention are<br>
skin and sun care lotions, liquid and bar soaps.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the cationic guar polymers<br>
provide flexibility to work in alkaline pH environment because they have no borax<br>
which is commonly used in current commercial cationic guar. In alkaline pH<br>
environments, guar polymers cross-link with boron ion and causes it to thicken<br>
and even form a gel-like network which is difficult to dispense through<br>
packaging material commonly found for body wash and other skin care products<br>
In accordance with the invention, the polymers that can be used in the<br>
invention include cationic galactomannan polymers or cationic derivatized<br>
galactomannan polymers having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) having<br>
a lower limit of 2,000, preferably 10,000, preferably 50,000, more preferably<br>
100,000, and even more preferably 400,000. The upper limit of the Mw of these<br>
polymers are 10,000,000, preferably 5,000,000, more preferably 2,000,000, and<br>
even more preferably 1,000,000. Examples of the polygalactomannans of this<br>
invention are guar, locust bean, honey locus, and flame tree with guar gum being<br>
the preferred source of the polygalactomannan. The preferred<br>
polygalactomannan starting material used in this invention is guar flour, guar<br>
powder, guar flakes, guar gum, or guar splits which have been derivatized with a<br>
cationic substituent.<br>
The preferred polymers of this invention are cationic polygalactomannan<br>
polymers. The amount of cationic functionality on the polygalactomannan can<br>
be expressed in terms of moles of substituent. The term "degree of substitution"<br>
as used in this invention is equivalent to the molar substitution, the average<br>
number of moles of functional groups per anhydro sugar unit in the<br>
polygalactomannan gum. The cationic functionality can be present on these<br>
polymers at a DS lower limit amount of 0.25, preferably about 0.4, and more<br>
preferably 0.8. The DS upper limit is normally about 3.0, preferably about 2.0,<br>
and more preferably 1.0.<br>
The cationic functionality of the polygalactomannan or derivatized<br>
polygalactomannan can be added to them by several methods. For example,<br>
the starting material can be reacted for a sufficient time and at a sufficient<br>
temperature with tertiary amino compound or quaternary ammonium compound<br>
containing groups capable of reacting with the reactive hydrogen ions present on<br>
the polygalactomannan or derivatized polygalactomannan in order to add the<br>
cationic functionality to the starting material. The sufficient time depends on the<br>
ingredients in the reaction mass and the temperature under which the reaction is<br>
taking place.<br>
The cationizing agent otthe present invention is defined as a compound<br>
which, by substitution reaction with the hydroxy groups of the<br>
polygalactomannan can make the product electrically positive, and there is no<br>
limitation to its types. Tertiary amino compounds or various quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds containing groups capable of reacting with reactive<br>
hydrogen present on the polysaccharide, can be used, such as 2-<br>
dialkylaminoethyl chloride and quaternary ammonium compounds such as <br>
chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride, and 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium<br>
chloride. Preferred examples include<br>
glycidyltrialkylammonium salts and 3-halo-2-hydroxypropyltrialkylammonium<br>
salts such as glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride, glycidyltriethylammonium<br>
chloride, gylcidyltripropylammonium chloride, glycidylethyldimethylammonium<br>
chloride, glycidyldiethylmethylammonium chloride, and their corresponding<br>
bromides and iodides; 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride, 3-<br>
chloro-2-hydroxypropyltriethylammonium chloride, 3-chloro-2-<br>
hydroxypropyltripropylammonium chloride, 3-chloro-2-<br>
hydroxypropylethyldimethylammonium chloride, and their corresponding<br>
bromides and iodides; and quaternary ammonium compounds such as halides<br>
of imidazoline ring containing compounds.<br>
Other derivatization of the catlonic polygalactomannan with nonionic<br>
substituents, i.e., hydroxyalkyl wherein the alkyl represents a straight or<br>
branched hydrocarbon moiety having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g., hydroxyethyl,<br>
hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl) or anionic substituents, such as carboxymethyl<br>
groups are optional. These optional substituents are linked to the<br>
polygalactomannan molecule by the reaction of the polygalactomannan molecule<br>
with reagents such as (1) alkylene oxides (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide,<br>
butylene oxide) to obtain hydroxyethyl groups, hydroxypropyl groups, or<br>
hydroxybutyl groups, or with (2) chloromethyl acetic acid to obtain a<br>
carboxymethyl group on the polygalactomannan. This reaction can take place<br>
when the polygalactomannan is in the "split", "flour" or any other physical form.<br>
The process for preparing derivatized polygalactomannan is well known in the<br>
art.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, surfactants are an important<br>
ingredient in skin care formulations and can be used either alone of in<br>
combination with other type of surfactants. The role of these surface active<br>
agents is to reduce surface tension when dissolved in water or water solution, or<br>
to reduce interfacial tension between two liquids, or between a liquid and a solid.<br>
These characteristics are often used in providing in removal of undesirable<br>
material from substrate such as skin or textile substrates. Examples of these<br>
surfactants include anionic, nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric or<br>
mixtures thereof type of surfactants. It is quite common to use mixtures of these<br>
surfactants in skin care products. The surfactant can be insoluble (or soluble) in<br>
the present invention and (when used) is present in the composition in the<br>
amount of from 1.0 to 90 % by weight of the composition.<br>
Anionic surfactants include alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. Specific<br>
examples of alkyl ether sulfates which can be used in the present invention are<br>
sodium coconut alkyl trimethylene glycol ether sulfate; sodium tallow alkyl<br>
trimethylene glycol ether sulfate; sodium tallow alkyl hexaoxyethylene sulfate;<br>
sodium tallow alkyl diethylene glycol ether sulfate; and sodium tallow alkyl<br>
sulfate. Other example of anionic surfactants are sulfonates, sulfosuccinates,<br>
sacosinates, carboxylates, and isethionates.<br>
Nonionic surfactants can be broadly defined as compounds containing a<br>
hydrophobic moiety and a nonionic hydrophilic moiety. Examples of the<br>
hydrophobic moiety can be alkyl, alkyl aromatic, dialkyl siloxane,<br>
polyoxyalkylene, and fluoro-substituted alkyls. Examples of hydrophilic moieties<br>
are polyoxyalkylenes, phosphine oxides, sulfoxides, amine oxides, and amides.<br>
Other examples of nonionic surfactants include alkyl polysaccharides such as<br>
alkyl polysaccharides.<br>
Cationic surfactants useful in the compositions of the present invention<br>
contain amino or quaternary ammonium hydrophilic moieties which are positively<br>
charged when dissolved in an aqueous composition of the present invention.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants are exemplified by those which can be broadly<br>
described as derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, and<br>
sulfonium compounds, In which the aliphatic radicals can be straight or branched<br>
chain, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to<br>
about 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water-solubilizing group,<br>
e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate.<br>
Examples of amphoteric surfactants which can be used in the<br>
compositions of the present invention are those which are broadly described as<br>
derivatives of aliphatic secondary and. tertiary amines in which the aliphatic<br>
radical can be straight or branched chain and wherein one of the aliphatic<br>
substituents contains from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and one contains<br>
an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate,<br>
or phosphonate.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Body Wash - Sodium Luareth Sulfate/Cocamideamidopropyl betaine/Sodium Chloride<br>
with N-Hance® 3215 and with AQU D3799 (Table 1 &amp; 2)<br>
This Example is to illustrate the invention and compare it with a prior art<br>
commercial cationic polymer, N-Hance® 3215 product, that has a cationic DS of<br>
about 0.2 and a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 1,350,000 via size<br>
exclusion chromatography. A cationic guar product of the present invention,<br>
referred to as AQU D3799, has cationic DS of 0.63 and a weight average<br>
Molecular weight of 1,120,000.<br>
A stock solution of the body wash was made with a 10 % "hole" in it to<br>
add salt thickener at a later stage has the following formulation:<br>
35.31 g Deionized water<br>
O.SOg Cationic guar N-Hance® 3215<br>
43.64g Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)<br>
10.00g Cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB)<br>
OO.SOg DMDM Hydantoin<br>
The N-Hance 3215 product was added to the water while mixing. Next, 5<br>
% citric acid solution was added to N-Hance product and water mixture in order<br>
to lower the pH to about 6.0. This mixture was mixed for an hour. The SLES<br>
was added slowly to this mixture while mixing. The new mixture was continued<br>
being mixed until the body wash mixture looked homogeneous. Next, the CAPB<br>
was added while mixing. Again, the mixture was allowed to mix until<br>
homogenous. Next, DMDM Hydantoin was added and mixed for about 10<br>
minutes. The pH of the body wash was then adjusted to between 6 to 6.5 with<br>
citric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions.<br>
To 90.0 grams of this body wash, 25 % sodium chloride solution was<br>
added to achieve desired salt concentration in the final body wash formulation.<br>
For salt level above 2.5 % active, dry salt was added to the body wash. The<br>
same procedure was followed for the polymer of this invention, AQU D3799.<br>
The body wash viscosity was measured with Brookfield LVT viscometer.<br>
Viscosity was measured at 25° C. Product stability was visually observed for<br>
homogeneity, insoluble gels or phase separation. Body wash clarity was visually<br>
rated as being "clear", "very slightly hazy," "slightly hazy", "moderately hazy", and<br>
"very hazy", "considerable hazy", "sever hazy" and "opaque". This type of rating<br>
is common in the Personal Care Industry for comparative expression of product<br>
clarity study. Clarity also was measured at 600 nm using a Spectrophotometer,<br>
Gary 5E UV-VIS-NIR, available from Varian Instruments, Inc., or equivalent. The<br>
clarity measurements at 600 nm wavelength are reported as % T value in the<br>
tables. The higher the number, the clearer is the solution.<br>
In Tables 1 and 2, the two cationic guars were compared for their<br>
compatibility in sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium<br>
chloride based body wash systems. Sodium chloride is a salt found in body wash<br>
systems as a rheology modifier. With the N-Hance® 3215 product, a<br>
commercially available cationic guar product, the body wash system was<br>
unstable without the salt and with a very low salt level. In addition, as the salt<br>
level was increased, the body wash system became unstable which was<br>
reflected by poor clarity. Clarity was measured by measuring % T (transmittance<br>
at 600 nm). At 3.0 % salts levels insoluble gels were observed. With the AQU<br>
D3799 polymer of this invention, the body wash system was unstable in absence<br>
of sodium chloride or at very low level of salt. However, it did not show instability<br>
with increase in salt level as did the commercial N-Hance 3215 products.<br>
A blind panel test was used to determine whether an individual can<br>
aesthetically feel differences in body wash formulations prepared with the current<br>
commercial N-Hance® 3215 product versus with the polymer of this invention,<br>
AQU D3799. In the blind test a test member was asked to wash her hands first<br>
with about 40°C plain water. Next, 2.0 ml of body wash was dispensed in the<br>
palm of a test member's hands. The test member was asked to wash all sides of<br>
both hands with the body wash for 30 seconds. Next, the panel members were<br>
asked to wash their hands thoroughly with plain 40°C water for 30 seconds.<br>
Hands were then pad dried with paper towels. During this cycle the test member<br>
was asked to comment on lather properties, lather volume, ease of lather, ease<br>
of rinsing and skin after feel. According to the test member, the body wash with<br>
polymer of the invention gave very rich lather, was less slippery, and was more<br>
conditioning as compared to the body wash formulated with the commercial NHance<br>

This Example illustrates the performance comparison of commercial NHance<br>
® 3215 cationic guar to product of this invention, AQU D3799. N-Hance®<br>
3215 product has cationic DS of about 0.19 and the weight average molecular<br>
weight of 1,350,000 per size exclusion chromatography. The AQU D3799<br>
product has a cationic DS of 0.63 and a weight average molecular weight of<br>
1,120,000.<br>
A stock solution body wash was made with a 10 % "hole" in it to add salt<br>
thickener at a later stage as follows:<br>
37.81 g Deionized water<br>
0.50g cationicguar N-Hance® 3215<br>
42.14g Ammonium Laureth Sulfate (ALES)<br>
9.00g Cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPS)<br>
OO.SOg DMDM Hydantoin<br>
N-Hance® 3215 product was added to the water while mixing. Next, 5 %<br>
citric acid solution was added to lower pH to about 6.0 and then the mixture was<br>
mixed for an hour. ALES was added slowly while mixing and the mixture was<br>
continued mixing until the body wash looked homogeneous. Next, CAPB was<br>
added while mixing. Again, the mixture was allowed to mix until homogenous.<br>
Next, DMDM Hydantoin was added and mixed for about 10 minutes. The pH of<br>
the body wash was adjusted between 6 to 6.5 with citric acid or sodium<br>
hydroxide solutions.<br>
To 90.0 grams of this body wash, 25 % sodium chloride solution was<br>
added to achieve the desired salt concentration in final body wash formulation.<br>
For salt level above 2.5 % active, dry salt was added to body wash. For polymer<br>
of this invention, AQU D3799, the same procedure was used<br>
In the ammonium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine based body<br>
wash, the product of this invention AQU D3799 mentioned previously showed<br>
better product stability than the commercial product N-Hance® 3215 available<br>
from Aqualon. See Tables 3 and 4.<br>
A blind test was carried out to determine if a test subject could detect<br>
differences in body wash formulations prepared with the current commercial NHance<br>
® 3215 product versus with AQU D3799 of this invention. In the blind test<br>
the test subject was asked first to wash her hands with about plain 40°C water.<br>
Next, 2.00 ml of body wash was dispensed in the palm of the test subject's<br>
hands and the test subject was asked to wash all sides of both hands with the<br>
body wash for 30 seconds. Next, the test subject was asked to wash her hands<br>
thoroughly under 40"C water for 30 seconds. The hands were then pad dried<br>
with paper towel. During this cycle the test subject was asked to comment on<br>
lather properties, lather volume, ease of lather, ease of rinsing and skin after<br>
feel. According to the test subject body wash with polymer of the invention gave<br>
better lather, richer lather, less slippery, good conditioning as compared to body<br>
wash formulated with the commercial N-Hance® 3215 product.<br>

DMDM Hydantoin was added and mixed for about 10 minutes. The pH was<br>
adjusted with citric acid or sodium hydroxide solution to between 9 to 9.6.<br>
To 90.0 grams of this body wash solution, 10.0 grams of 25 % sodium<br>
chloride solution was added to achieve the desired salt concentration in final<br>
body wash formulation. Additional salt was added as dry salt when necessary to<br>
achieve desired salt concentration<br>
The body wash viscosity was measured with Brookfield® LVT viscometer.<br>
Product stability was visually observed for homogeneity, insoluble gels or phase<br>
separation. Body wash clarity was visually rated as being clear, very slightly<br>
hazy slightly hazy, moderate hazy, hazy, very hazy, considerable hazy, sever<br>
hazy, and opaque. This type of rating is common in the Personal Care Industry<br>
for comparative studies. The clarity was also measured at 600 nm using a<br>
Spectrophotometer, Gary 5E UV-VIS-NIR, available from Varian Instruments,<br>
Inc., or equivalent The clarity measurements at 600 nm wavelength are<br>
reported as %T value. The higher the number, the clearer is the solution.<br>
Addition of salt such as sodium chloride improved the clarity and stability<br>
of the body wash containing the guar product of this invention (i.e., ADPP 64-<br>
86). This was not the case with commercially available N-Hance 3215 product.<br>

N-Hance® 3215 and ADPP6486 polymers were added to water while<br>
mixing. Next pH was lowered to about 6 with citric acid solution. Mixing was<br>
continued until polymer dissolved. Next, ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium<br>
laureth sulfate, cocamide MEA, Methyl Gluceth-20 and PEG-120 Methyl glucose<br>
dioleate, DMDM Hydantoin were added in the order listed. Next body wash pH<br>
was adjusted to about 6 with NaOH solution.<br>
The addition of commercial N-Hance® 3215 increased viscosity of body<br>
was significantly compared to the body wash made with the polymer of this<br>
invention, ADPP6486. That is fora body wash formulation where conditioning<br>
cationic guar is desired, commercial N-Hance® 3215 would be undesirable due<br>
to significant increase in viscosity. A very high viscosity can make a difficult to<br>
dispense the product. In fact, polymer of this invention had no significant effect<br>
on the body wash viscosity when compared to body wash without the polymer of<br>
invention. The additions of polymer of this invention improve foam stability of the<br>
body wash over the body wash without any conditioning polymer. The lather<br>
drainage time for body wash without the polymer of this invention was 31<br>
seconds (30, 33 and 30 seconds) as compared to 42 seconds (48, 41,45 30 and<br>

cationic guar is desired, commercial N-Hance® 3215 would be undesirable due<br>
to it negative effect on the body wash viscosity. The additions of polymer of this<br>
invention improve foam stability of the body wash over the body wash without<br>
any conditioning polymer. The lather drainage time for the body wash without<br>
the polymer was 58 Seconds (48,48,64, 55, 74 seconds) compared to 80<br>

In container 1, Jaguar C162 polymer and polymer of this invention<br>
ADPP6486 were added to water and pH was lowered to 6.0 to 6.5. The solution<br>
was mixed until the polymer fully dissolved. In container 2, SLES, Disodium<br>
EDTA, Cetearyl alcohol and tricetylmethyl chloride were mixed together. Mixture<br>
of container 2 was added to container 1 while stirring and heated to 80°C. In a<br>
third container, 0.3 grams of Xanthan gum was added to 9.7 grams of water and<br>
mixed for 40 minutes. Next, CAPB, Glycol distearate, Laureth-4, cocamidopropyl<br>
betaine, formic acid Dimethicone, laureth-23 and laureth-3 and sodium laureth<br>
sulfate are added and mixed for one hour. While the ingredients in the third<br>
container was mixing, the mixture in container 1 was cooled while still under<br>
agitation by turning off the heat. Next, mixture of container 3 was added to<br>
container 1 and mixed for 15 minutes. Body wash pH was adjusted to between<br>

After shower Skin Conditioning liquid (Table 16)<br>
In container 1, hydroxyethyl cellulose was added to water and the pH was<br>
adjusted to about 8.5. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes or until the mixture<br>
became a clear solution. Next, conditioning cationic polymer AQU D3799 and<br>
AQU D3939 were added and mixed for an additional 30 minutes. This mixture<br>
was heated to 65°C until the mixture became homogenous. Next, cetyl alcohol<br>
was added and mixed until mixture became homogeneous and then it was<br>
cooled to 50°C while mixing. Potassium chloride was next added. Isopropyl<br>
myristate was then added and mixed until the mixture became homogeneous.<br>
The pH was then adjusted to between 5.25 and .5.5. Afterwards, preservative<br>
was added and cooled to room temperature while mixing.<br>
To determine a conditioning properties of a polymer, hairs are often<br>
treated with a conditioning agent dissolved or suspended in water and then hairs<br>
combed to measure force required to comb hair. A lower the combing force<br>
better the conditioning properties. Some time hair treated with fully formulated<br>
product containing conditioning agent are also used by both product<br>
manufacturers and the formulators. A lower the combing force, better the<br>
conditioning properties of a polymer. The following conditioning formula without<br>
the polymer required high stress to comb wet hair, about 4500gf-mm/g of hair<br>
compared to only about 600 to 900gf-mm/g of hair for the formulation with<br>
polymer of this invention. Similar trend was also observed for the dry hair. The<br>
fallowing conditioning Tormuia witnout the polymer required high stress to comb<br>
dry hair, about 325gf-mm/g of hair compared to only about 140gf-mm/g of hair<br>
for the formulation with polymer of this invention. This is a strong indication that<br>
polymer provides excellent conditioning. A commercial polymer GPX 247<br>
provided combing energy for wet hair about 1390 gf-mm/g and for dry hair about<br>
260gf-mm/g of hair<br>
