METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR KILLING SPORES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to enzymatic methods for killing or inactivating microbial spores.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Spores are known to form from aerobic Bacilli, anaerobic Clostridia, selected sarcinae and a few actinomycetes. Spores resemble certain plant seeds in that they do not carry out any metabolic reactions. In this regard they are especially suited to withstand severe environmental stress and are known to survive prolonged exposures to heat, drying, radiation and toxic chemicals. These properties make spores especially difficult to kill in environments, like living tissue or objects which come in contact with living tissue, which would be adversely effected by extreme conditions.<br>
Fungi, viruses and vegetative cells of pathogenic bacteria are sterilized within minutes at 70 degrees Celsius; many spores are sterilized at 100 degrees Celsius. However, the spores of some saprophytes can survive boiling for hours. Heat is presently the most commonly used means to insure sterilization of spores.<br>
A particularly difficult problem relates to microbiocidal treatment of bacterial spore-forming microorganisms of the Bacillus cereus group.<br>
Microorganisms of the Bacillus cereus group include Bacillus cereus, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These microorganisms share many phenotypical properties, have a high level of chromosomal sequence similarity, and are known enterotoxin producers.<br>
Although all spore-forming microorganisms are problematic for microbiocidal treatments because they form spores, Bacillus cereus is one of the most problematic because Bacillus cereus has been identified as possessing increased resistance to germicidal chemicals used to decontaminate environmental surfaces.<br>
Bacillus cereus is a particularly well-established enterotoxin producer and food-borne pathogen. This organism is frequently diagnosed as a cause of gastrointestinal disorders and has been suggested to be the cause of several foodborne illness outbreaks. The organism is ubiquitous in nature, and as a consequence, is present in animal feed and fodder. Due to its rapid sporulating capacity, the organism easily survives in the environment and can survive intestinal passage in cows. The organism can contaminate raw milk via feces and soil, and Bacillus cereus can easily survive the pasteurization process.<br><br>
The present .invention provides an improved enzymatic method for killing or inactivating spores.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides as a first aspect a sporocidal composition comprising a laccase or a compound exhibiting laccase activity, a source of oxygen, a source of iodide ions and an enhancing agent.<br>
In a second aspect is provided a method of killing or inactivating spores, comprising contacting the spores with the sporocidal composition of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect is provided a method of decontaminating a location, which has been exposed to spores, comprising contacting the spores with the composition of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect is provided a container comprising the composition of the invention,      i wherein the components of the composition are packaged in one or more compartments or layers.<br>
In a fifth aspect is provided a ready-to-use sporocidal formulation comprising the composition of the invention.<br>
In embodiments, the source of iodide may be one or more salts of iodide, such as sodium iodide or potassium iodide or mixtures thereof.<br>
In other embodiments, the sporocidal composition of the invention further comprises a surfactant.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Laccases and Compounds Exhibiting Laccase Activity<br>

Preferred laccase enzymes and/or compounds exhibiting laccase activity are enzymes of microbial origin. The enzymes may be derived from plants, bacteria or fungi (including filamentous fungi and yeasts).<br>
Suitable examples from fungi include a laccase derivable from a strain of Aspergillus, Neurospora, e.g., N. crassa, Podospora, Botrytis, Collybia, Fomesl Lentinus, Pleurotus, Trametes, e.g., T. villosa and T. versicolor, Rhizoctonia, e.g., R. solani, Coprinus, e.g., C. cinereus, C. comatus, C. friesii, and C. plicatilis, Psathyrella, e.g., P. condelleana, Panaeolus,<br><br>
e.g., P. papilionaceus, Myceliophthora, e.g., M. thermophila, Schytalidium, e.g., S. thermophilum, Polyporus, e.g., P. pinsitus, Phlebia, e.g., P. radita (WO 92/01046), or Coriolus, e.g.. C. hirsutus (JP 2-238885).<br>
Suitable examples from bacteria include a laccase derivable from a strain of Bacillus.<br>
A laccase derived from Coprinus, Myceliophthora, Polyporus, Scytaiidium or Rhizoctonia is preferred; in particular a laccase derived from Coprinus cinereus, Myceliophthora thermophila, Polyporus pinsitus, Scytaiidium thermophilum or Rhizoctonia solani.<br>
The laccase or the laccase related enzyme may furthermore be one which is producible by a method comprising cultivating a host cell transformed with a recombinant DNA vector which carries a DNA sequence encoding said laccase as well as DNA sequences encoding functions permitting the expression of the DNA sequence encoding the laccase, in a culture medium under conditions permitting the expression of the laccase enzyme, and recovering the laccase from the culture.<br>
Determination of Laccase Activity (LACU)<br>
Laccase activity (particularly suitable for Polyporus laccases) may be determined from the oxidation of syringaldazin under aerobic conditions. The violet colour produced is photometered at 530 nm. The analytical conditions are 19 mM syringaldazin, 23 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.5f 30°C, 1 min. reaction time.<br>
1 laccase unit (LACU) is the amount of enzyme that catalyses the conversion of 1.0 mmole syringaldazin per minute at these conditions.<br>
Determination of Laccase Activity (LAMU)<br>
Laccase activity may be determined from the oxidation of syringaldazin under aerobic conditions. The violet colour produced is measured at 530 nm. The analytical conditions are 19 mM syringaldazin, 23 mM Tris/maleate buffer, pH 7.5, 30°C, 1 min. reaction time.<br>
1 laccase unit (LAMU) is the amount of enzyme that catalyses the conversion of 1.0 mmole syringaldazin per minute at these conditions.<br>
Source of Oxygen<br>
The source of oxygen required by the laccase or the compound exhibiting laccase activity may be oxygen from the atmosphere or an oxygen precursor for in situ production of oxygen. Oxygen from the atmosphere will usually be present in sufficient quantity. If more 02 is needed, additional oxygen may be added, e.g. as pressurized atmospheric air or as pure pressurized 02.<br><br>

Compositions<br>
The present invention provides a composition comprising a laccase or a compound exhibiting laccase activity, a source of oxygen, a source of iodide ions and an enhancing agent.<br>
The laccase or the compound exhibiting laccase activity, the source of iodide ions and the enhancing agent may be formulated as a liquid (e.g. aqueous), a solid, a gel, a paste or a dry product formulation. The dry product formulation may subsequently be re-hydrated to form an active liquid or semi-liquid formulation usable in the method of the invention.<br><br><br>
When the lacease or the compound exhibiting laccase activity, the source of iodide ions and the enhancing agent are formulated as a dry formulation, the components may be mixed, arranged in discrete layers or packaged separately.<br>
When formulated as a solid, all components may be mixed together, e.g., as a powder, a granulate or a gelled product.<br>
When other than dry form compositions are used and even in that case, it is preferred to use a two-part formulation system having the enzyme(s) separate from the rest of the composition.<br>
The composition of the invention may further comprise auxiliary agents such as wetting agents, thickening agents, buffer, stabilisers, perfume, colourants, fillers and the like.<br>
Useful wetting agents are surfactants, i.e. non-ionic, anionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants. Surfactants are further described above.<br>
The composition of the invention may be a concentrated product or a ready-to-use product. In use, the concentrated product is typically diluted with water to provide a medium having an effective sporocidal activity, applied to the object to be cleaned or disinfected, and allowed to react with the spores present.<br>
The pH of an aqueous solution of the composition is in the range of from pH 2 to 11, preferably in the range of from pH 3 to 10.5, more preferably in the range of from pH 4 to 10, most preferably in the range of from pH 5 to 9, and in particular in the range of from pH 6 to 8.<br>
Methods and Uses<br>
The present invention provides an enzymatic method for killing or inactivating spores, comprising contacting the spores with a laccase or a compound exhibiting laccase activity, a source of oxygen, a source of iodide ions and an enhancing agent.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term "killing or inactivating spores" is intended to mean that at least 99% of the spores are not capable of transforming (germinating) into vegetative cells. Preferably 99.9% (more preferably 99.99% and most preferably 99.999%) of the spores are not capable of transforming into vegetative cells.<br>
The spores may be contacted by the composition of the invention at a temperature between 0 and 90 degrees Celsius, preferably between 5 and 80 degrees Celsius, more preferably between 10 and 70 degrees Celsius, even more preferably between 15 and 60 degrees Celsius, most preferably between 18 and 50 degrees Celsius, and in particular between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius.<br>
The composition of the invention is suitable for killing or inactivating spores in a variety of environments. The composition of the invention may desirably be used in any environment to reduce spore contamination, such as the health-care industry (e.g. animal hospitals, human<br><br>
hospitals, animal clinics, human clinics, nursing homes, day-care facilities for children or senior citizens, etc.), the food industry (e.g. restaurants, food-processing plants, food-storage plants, grocery stores, etc.), the hospitality industry (e.g. hotels, motels, resorts, cruise ships, etc.), the education industry (e.g. schools and universities), etc.<br>
The composition of the invention may desirably be used in any environment to reduce spore contamination, such as general-premise surfaces (e.g. floors, walls, ceilings, exterior of furniture, etc.), specific-equipment surfaces (e.g. hard surfaces, manufacturing equipment, processing equipment, etc.), textiles (e.g. cottons, wools, silks, synthetic fabrics such as polyesters, polyolefins, and acrylics, fiber blends such as cottonpolyester, etc.), wood and cellulose-based systems (e.g. paper), soil, animal carcasses (e.g. hide, meat, hair, feathers, etc.), foodstuffs (e.g. fruits, vegetables, nuts, meats, etc.), and water.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the invention is directed to sporocidal treatment of      ; textiles.  Spores of the Bacillus cereus group have been identified as the predominant postlaundering contaminant of textiles. Thus, the treatment of textiles with a composition of the invention is particularly useful for sporocidal activity against the contaminants of textiles.<br>
Examples of textiles that can be treated with the composition of the invention include, but are not limited to, personal items (e.g. shirts, pants, stockings, undergarments, etc.), institutional items (e.g. towels, lab coats, gowns, aprons, etc.), hospitality items (e.g. towels, napkins, tablecloths, etc.).<br>
A sporocidal treatment of textiles with a composition of the invention may include contacting a textile with a composition of the invention. This contacting can occur prior to laundering the textile. Alternatively, this contacting can occur during laundering of the textile to provide sporocidal activity and optionally provide cleansing activity to remove or reduce soils, stains, etc. from the textile.<br>
The spores which are contacted by the composition of the invention may be situated on any surface including, but not limited to, a surface of a process equipment used in e.g. a dairy, a chemical or pharmaceutical process plant, a piece of laboratory equipment, a water sanitation system, an oil processing plant, a paper pulp processing plant, a water treatment plant, or a cooling tower. The composition of the invention should be used in an amount, which is effective for killing or inactivating the spores on the surface in question.<br>
The spores may be contacted with the composition of the invention by submerging the spores in an aqueous formulation of the composition (e.g. a laundering process), by spraying the composition onto the spores, by applying the composition to the spores by means of a cloth, or by any other method recognized by the skilled person. Any method of applying the composition of the invention to the spores, which results in killing or inactivating the spores, is an acceptable method of application.<br><br>
The method of the invention is also useful for decontamination of locations which have been exposed to spores (e.g. pathogenic spores), such as biological warfare agents, e.g. spores of Bacillus anthrasis capable of causing anthrax. Such locations include, but are not limited to, clothings (such as army clothings), inner and outer parts of vehicles, inner and outer parts of buildings, any kind of army facility, and any kind of environment mentioned above.<br>
The present invention is further described by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Chemicals used as buffers and substrates were commercial products of at least reagent grade.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Production of Spores<br>
A Tryptose Blod Agar Base (TBAB) plate was streaked from a fresh culture of Bacillus thuringiensis (B. thuhngiensis type strain ATCC10792). The culture was incubated overnight at 30 degrees Celsius.<br>
A loopfull of pure B. thuringiensis cells from the TBAB plate was suspended in 2 ml of sterile water. 2xSG plates were each inoculated with 100 microliter of the cell suspension. The composition of 2xSG was as follows: 16 g/L Difco Bacto Nutrient Broth, 0.5 g/L MgS04x 7H20, 2.0 g/L KCI, 1-0 mi/100 ml of 10% glucose, 0.1 ml/100 ml of 1 M Ca(N03)2, 0.1 ml/100 ml of 0.1 M MnS04, 10 microliter/100 ml of 0.01 M FeS04, and 1% Difco Bacto Agar.<br>
Plates were incubated for 48-72 hrs. at 30 degrees Celsius. Sporulation was checked with phase-contrast microscopy. Spores are phase-bright.<br>
When sporulation efficiency was close to 100%, the cell lawn was harvested with water and the cells were suspended by intensive vortexing. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 5-10 minutes at 6000G at 4 degrees Celsius, and washed 3 times with ice cold water. The pellet contained vegetative cells and spores.<br>
A step-density gradient was applied for separation of the spores from the vegetative cells. A centrifuge tube containing 30 ml 43% Urographin® was prepared for each washed pellet. 3 ml of celt spore mixture in Urographin was prepared so that the final Urographin concentration was 20%. The 20% Urographin cell/spore mixture was gently loaded onto the top layer of the centrifuge tubes containing 43% Urographin.<br>
The centrifuge tubes were centrifuged at 10000G at room temperature for 30 minutes. The supernatant was gently removed. The pure spore pellet was suspended in 1 ml ice-cold<br><br>
water and transferee! to a microfuge tube. Centrifugation was continued at maximum speed for 1-2 min at 4 degrees Celsius, and the pellet was washed in ice-cold water 2 more times.<br>
The purity and number of spores/ml was checked by phase contrast microscopy and a haemocytometer. The spores were stored suspended in water at minus 20 degrees Celsius.<br>
Bacillus globigii spores were produced by following the same procedure as outlined above.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Killing of Spores<br>
The following reagents were prepared:<br>
DMG buffer (3,3-DiMethylGlutaric acid, Sigma D4379), 50 mM, pH adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH;<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis spores were re-suspended in DMG buffer to a density of 2x109 spores<br>
per ml;<br>
Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (as disclosed in WO 95/33836, SEQ ID NO:1; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 200 microgram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>

200 mM Potassium iodide (Kl) solution in water;<br>
1 mM Methylsyringate (methyl 3f5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate, Sigma S40.944-8) solution<br>
in ethanol/DMG buffer (1:1);<br>
3 mM MTT (S^.S-Dimethylthiazol-yO^.S-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma M2128) solution<br>
in water.<br>
TBB growth medium: 10g/ITryptose, 3 g/l Beef Extract, 5 g/l NaCI, water ad 1000 ml final pH 7.2 +/- 0.2.<br>
Spore suspension was pipetted into the wells in row A of a microtiter plate. The other reagents were added as indicated in table 1 below. The reaction was initiated by the addition of laccase solution.<br><br><br>
The microtiter plate was incubated at room temperature (24 degrees Celsius) for 1 hour. 180 microliter TBB growth medium was added to all wells in rows B to H of the microtiter plate. Serial 10 fold dilutions were made by pipetting 20 microliter from row A to row B, and then from row B to row C, and then from row C to row D, and so on until row H.<br>
The microtiter plate was incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 20-24 hours to allow spores to germinate and grow. Growth was evaluated by a microplate reader and visually by "developing the growth" by addition of 5 microliter 3 mM MTT to each well. Formation of purple fomnazans reveals bacterial growth and thus the degree of spore inactivation. In the tables growth is indicated with a M+" symbol.<br>

Coprinus cinereus laccase (as disclosed in WO 97/08325, figure 1, SEQ ID NO:27; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 500 microgram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>
Rhizoctonia solanii laccase (as disclosed in WO 95/07988, figure 4, SEQ ID NO: 14; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 500 microgram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>
Polyporus pinsitus laccase (as disclosed in WO 96/00290, figure 1, SEQ ID NO:1; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 500 microgram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>
200 mM Potassium iodide (Kl) solution in water;<br>
1 mM Methylsyringate (methyl 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate, Sigma S40.944-8) solution<br>
in ethanol/DMG buffer (1:1);<br><br>
3 mM MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthia2ol-yl)-2,5-diphenyitetrazoIium bromide, Sigma M2128) solution in water.<br>
TBB growth medium: 10 g/l Tryptose, 3 g/l Beef Extract, 5 g/l NaCI, water ad 1000 ml final pH 7.2 +/- 0.2.<br>
Spore suspension was pipetted into the wells in row A of all microliter plates. The other<br>
reagents were added as indicated in table 4 below. The reaction was initiated by the addition<br>
of laccase solution. The microliter plates were then incubated at the specified temperature for<br>
1 hour.<br>
180 microliter TBB growth medium was added to all wells in rows B to H of the microtiter<br>
plates.<br>
Serial 10 fold dilutions were made by pipetting 20 microliter from row A to row B, and then from<br>
row B to row C, and then from row C to row Df and so on until row H.<br><br>
The microtiter plates were incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 20-24 hours to allow spores to germinate and grow. Growth was evaluated by a microplate reader and visually by "developing the growth" by addition of 5 microliter 3 mM MTT to each well. Formation of purple formazans reveals bacterial growth and thus the degree of spore inacttvation. The sporocidal potential was calculated as the difference of the number of dilution steps with bacterial growth between the control and the laccase/iodide/methylsyringate containing wells. The sporocidal potential is measured in log units (log U) - one log unit equals a difference in growth of one 10-fold dilution step as described in Example 2.<br><br>
The results from testing the four laccases at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 degrees Celsius are summarised in tables 5, 6, 7 and 8.<br><br>
The results shown in tables 5-8 indicate that all four laccases exhibit sporocidal activity and that the optimal sporocidal effect is delivered in the temperature range 15-45 degrees Celsius.<br>

270 microliter 1,2-propanediol<br>
2600 microliter DMG buffer, pH 6.5<br>
yielding a mixture with 25 microgramme/ml Polyporus pinsitus Iaccase.<br>
1400 microliter of the above-mentioned mixtures A, B, C or D were pipetted onto the surfaces of the tiles and gently spread to cover the tile from corner to corner with the pipette tip. As a control, the spore inoculated tiles were treated with 1400 microliter of the control substance: 270 microliter 1,2-propanediol mixed with 2700 microliter DMG buffer pH 6.5. The tiles were allowed to incubate, uncovered, at room temperature (approx. 21 degrees Celsius) over night. The surface of each dry tile was covered by a thin layer of molten (approx. 45 degrees Celsius) TBB growth medium with agarose. When the agarose growth medium had solidified, the tiles were incubated in a moist chamber at 30 degrees Celsius for approx. 20 hours. Following incubation, microcolonies were revealed by adding 3 mM MTT, drop by drop, until the agarose surface of the tile was covered. After 1/2 - 2 hours live micro-colonies were seen as purple spots. In table 15 the results from a comparison of the treated tiles with control tiles are shown.<br><br>
'I able lb. Decontamination OT ceramic tiles seeded with Bacillus thunngiensis spores with laccase-iodide-enhancer solution with decreasing amounts of laccase<br>
The results demonstrate that spores deposited  on surfaces are inactivated  by laccase decontamination systems with low (less than 50 mg/l) laccase concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Killing of spores deposited on textile<br>
The following reagents were prepared:<br>
Spores were re-suspended in sterile water to a density of 6x108/ml.<br>
DMG buffer (3,3-DiMethylGlutaric acid, Sigma D4379), 50 mM, pH adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH;<br>
DMG buffer (3,3-DiMethylGlutaric acid, Sigma D4379), 50 mM, pH adjusted to 6.0 with NaOH;<br>
Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (as disclosed in WO 95/33836, SEQ ID NO:1; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 30 milligram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>
200 mM Potassium iodide (Kl) solution in water;<br>
10 mM Methylsyringate (methyl 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate, Sigma S40.944-8) solution<br>
in Ethanol/DMG buffer (1:1);<br>
0.1%(v/v)Tween<br>
3 mM MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma M2128) solution<br>
in water.<br>
TBB growth medium: 10 g/ITryptose, 3 g/l Beef Extract, 5 g/l NaCI, water ad 1000 ml final pH 7.2 +/- 0.2.<br><br>
Laccase-iodide-enhancer solution;<br>
37 microliter Myceliopthora thermophiia laccase solution<br>
115 microliter Potassium iodide solution<br>
37 microliter methylsyringate solution<br>
500 microliter 1,2-propanediol<br>
4311 microliter DMG buffer, pH 6.0<br>
100 microliter of the spore suspension was pipetted onto three dry Pro-shot Gun cleaning cotton patches, 1 1/8" x 1 1/8". The patches (patch 1, patch 2 and control) were allowed to dry overnight at room temperature.<br>
Each of patch 1 and patch 2 were placed in a 5 cm open Petri dish and 2 ml of the laccase-iodide-enhancer solution was poured onto the patch and the open Petri dish with the patch was allowed to incubate at room temperature (approx. 24 degrees Celsius) for 24 hours. A patch (control) treated with a 500 microliter 1,2-propanediol in 4500 microliter DMG buffer pH 6.5 was used as a control.<br>
The almost-dry patches were transferred to 50 ml screwcapped disposable centrifuge tubes containing 10 ml 0.1% (v/v) Tween. The tubes were immersed in an ultrasound (Branson) cleaning bath for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>
100 microliter of the fluid from the ultrasound treated centrifuge tubes were pipetted to wells in row A in a microtiter plate according to table 16.<br><br>
Table 16. Microtiter plate setup.<br>
180 microliter TBB growth medium was added to all wells in rows B to H of the microtiter plate. Serial 10 fold dilutions were made by pipetting 20 microliter from row A to row B, and then from row B to row C, and then from row C to row D, and so on until row H. Then 150 microliter TBB was pipetted into the wells in row A<br><br>
The microtiter plate was incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 12-24 hours to allow spores to germinate and grow. Growth was evaluated by a microplate reader and visually by "developing the growth" by addition of 5 microliter 3 mM MTT to each well. Formation of purple formazans reveals bacterial growth and thus the degree of spore inactivation.<br>
Table 17. Results of evaluation of growth.<br>
The results in Table 17 show that only the spore containing patches treated with both laccase, potassium iodide and enhancing agent (methylsyringate) are effectively disinfected.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Thiosulphate quenching of the sporocidal effect<br>
The following reagents were prepared:<br>
DMG buffer (3,3-DiMethyIGIutaric acid, Sigma D4379), 50 mM, pH adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH;<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis Spores were re-suspended in DMG buffer to a density of 2x109 spores<br>
per ml;<br>
Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (as disclosed in WO 95/33836, SEQ ID NO:1; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 6000 microgram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>
200 mM Potassium iodide (Kl) solution in water;<br>
1 mM Methylsyringate (methyl 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate, Sigma S40.944-8) solution<br>
in ethanol/DMG buffer (1:1);<br>
Sterile water;<br>
10% (W/V) sodium thiosulphate;<br><br>
3 mM MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma M2128) solution in water.<br>
TBB growth medium; 10g/lTryptose, 3 g/i Beef Extract, 5 g/l NaCI, water ad 1000 mi final pH 7.2 +/- 0.2.<br>
Spore suspension was pipetted into the wells in row A of 5 microliter plates. The other reagents were added as indicated in table 18 below. The reaction was initiated by the addition of laccase solution. The microtiter plates was then preincubated at 30 degrees Celsius for the specified times; one for 15 minutes, one for 30 minutes, one for 1 hour, one for 2 hours and one for 22 hours.<br>
At the end of the preincubation 50 microliter 10 % (w/v) sodium thiosulphate was added to each well in row A and the plate was allowed to incubate a further 60 minutes at room temperature (approx. 24 degrees Celsius).<br><br>
Table 18. Microtiter plate setup.<br>
(*) Added after 15 and 30 minutes and after 1, 2 and 22 hours preincubation.<br>
180 microliter TBB growth medium was added to all wells in rows B to H of the microtiter plate. Then serial 10 fold dilutions were made by pipetting 20 microliter from row A to row B, and then from row B to row C, and then from row C to row D, and so on until row H. The microtiter plates were incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 20-24 hours to allow spores to germinate and grow. Growth was evaluated by a microplate reader and visually by "developing<br><br>
the growth" by addition of 5 microliter 3 mM MTT to each well. Formation of purple formazans reveals bacterial growth and thus the degree of spore inactivation. The difference in growth between the control without laccase and the laccase killing mixture, where growth can be detected, directly gives the killing potential in log units.<br><br>

Thiosulphate is known to oxidise iodide very efficiently. The spore inactivation patterns demonstrates that incubation of spores with the laccase system for more than 1 hour, results in irreversible spore inactivation.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
NaOH quenching of the sporocidal effect<br>
The following reagents were prepared:<br>
DMG buffer (3,3-DiMethylGlutaric acid, Sigma D4379), 50 mM, pH adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH;<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis spores were re-suspended in DMG buffer to a density of 2x109 spores<br>
per ml;<br>
Myceliopthora thermophila laccase  (as disclosed in WO 95/33836, SEQ  ID NO:1; and<br>
available from Novozymes A/S) was diluted to 6000 microgram per ml in DMG buffer;<br>
200 mM Potassium iodide (Kl) solution in water;<br>
1 mM Methylsyringate (methyl 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate, Sigma S40,944-8) solution<br>
in ethanol/DMG buffer (1:1);<br>
Sterile water;<br>
0.5 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH);<br>
0.5 M Hydrochloric Acid (HCI)<br>
3 mM MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma M2128) solution<br>
in water.<br>
TBB growth medium: 10g/l Tryptose, 3 g/l Beef Extract, 5 g/l NaCI, water ad 1000 ml final pH 7.2 +/- 0.2.<br>
Spore suspension was pipetted into the wells in row A of five microtiter plates. The other reagents were added as indicated in table 24 below. The reaction was initiated by the addition of laccase solution. The five microtiter plates were then preincubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 22 hours.<br>
At the end of the incubation 25 microliter 0.5 M sodium hydroxide was added to specified wells in row A, se table 23. Following a further incubation period of 60 minutes the added NaOH was neutralized by the addition of 25 microliter 0.5 M HCI.<br><br><br><br>
Table 24. Microtiter plate setup.<br>
(*) Added after 15, 30 minutes and after 1 hour 2 hours and 22 hours preincubation.<br>
(**) Added after 60 minutes incubation with NaOH.<br>
180 microliter TBB growth medium was added to all wells in rows B to H of the microtiter plate. Then serial 10 fold dilutions were made by pipetting 20 microliter from row A to row B, and then from row B to row C, and then from row C to row D, and so on until row H.<br>
The microtiter plates were incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 20-24 hours to allow spores to germinate and grow. Growth was evaluated by a microplate reader and visually by "developing the growth" by addition of 5 microliter 3 mM MTT to each well. Formation of purple formazans reveals bacterial growth and thus the degree of spore inactivation<br><br><br><br>
Table 29. Inactivation of spores by the laccase system. 22 hours preincubation.<br>
Incubating spores (preincubated with laccase system) with an alkalihydroxide reverses the inactivation to some extent. The longer the laccase system acts on the spores the greater the nonreversible inactivation is obtained. Preincubation for more than 4 hours practically renders the spores unable to germinate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
