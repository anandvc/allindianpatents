				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bleaching composition which comprise a catalytically effective, amount of a transition metal bleach catalyst which is a complex of a transition metal and a cross bridged macropolycyclic ligand and an anti oxidant or reducing agent which serves to stabilize said catalyst. The present invention further relates to a method for bleaching/cleaning fabric with a catalytically effective amount of said stabilized transition metal bleach catalyst wherein the method is performed substantially free of any organic or inorganic peroxygen compound or precursors to any organic or inorganic peroxygen compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bleaching of fabric is essentially exposing soiled or stained fabric to a chemical reaction the purpose of which is to eliminate the soil or stain. At one point in time, bleaching involved exposure of fabric to a solution of hypochlorite. Therefore, fabric which was colored or dyed via sensitive pigments were excluded from treatment with bleach. To the benefit of the consumer, formulators developed various forms of bleach inter alia peroxygen bleaching systems which typically comprise a source of hydrogen peroxide and a bleach activator. This combination of source of hydrogen peroxide and activator plays a dominating role in effective, safe bleaching compositions. An effective example of this peroxygen bleaching system employs perborate (peroxygen source) and nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (activator).<br>
In order to boost the performance of bleaching agents and to develop bleaching systems which are safe to any type of dyed or colored fabric inter alia silk, polyester blends, cotton, nylon, formulators have continued to develop peroxygen bleaching systems, as well as new methods of forming activated oxygen.<br>
However, there still remains a need in the art for a stable bleaching system which will effectively bleach fabric without the need for reactive chemicals such as peroxides, sources of peroxide, and/or mixtures thereof. Said stable bleaching system will comprise a transition metal catalyst which does not loose its effectiveness due to the instability of the catalyst to oxidation and/or reduction post formulation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in that it has been surprisingly discovered that bleaching systems comprising a transition metal catalyst which are capable of bleaching soils and stains in the absence of a source of hydrogen peroxide or other peroxygen bleaching agent can be successfully stabilized against the unwanted degradation of the transition metal catalyst. In other words, it has been surprisingly discovered that the addition of an effective amount of an anti oxidant and/or free radical scavenger or an reducing agent can stabilize a nil hydrogen peroxide bleaching system.<br>

C)	the balance carriers and other adjunct ingredients;<br>
provided said composition is substantially free of any organic or inorganic peroxygen compounds.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for cleaning and7or bleaching soils and stains on fabrics, said method comprising the step of contacting the fabric in need of cleaning and/or bleaching with an aqueous solution containing a composition which is substantially free of a peroxygen source and which comprises:<br>
a)	a catalytically effective amount of a transition metal bleach catalyst which is a<br>

c)	the balance carriers and other adjunct ingredients;<br>
provided the concentration of said transition metal bleach catalyst in the aqueous solution is at least about 0.01 ppb and said composition is substantially free of any organie or inorganic peroxygen compounds.<br>
The compositions and methods of the present invention are suitable for cleaning/bleaching any surface in need of stain removal. For example, hard surface cleaners and<br>
automatic dishwashing compositions can employ the bleach catalyst of the present invention is applications which are substantially free of any organic or inorganic peroxygen compounds.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims.<br>

The present composition is a synergistic composition where the ingredients interact synergistically and giving surprising result. There is no chemical reaction involve among the ingredients of the composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the surprising discovery that transition metal catalysts which are capable of bleaching of soils and stains in the absence of an added peroxygen bleach can be suitably stabilized by the addition of one or more stabilizing agents. The stabilizing agents suitable for use in the present invention are present at varying level depending upon the formulation inter alia liquid, solid, gel, and the concentration of the transition metal present. Absence of Peroxygen Sources<br>
The compositions of the present invention, as well as the methods for cleaning and/or bleaching of fabric which utilize the compositions of the present invention are substantially free of any peroxygen source such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacid etc. The compositions of the present invention need only have an effective amount of the herein below described catalyst present for effective bleaching. For the purposes of the present invention the term "substantially free" is defined as "the formulator does not include in the composition any peroxygen compound or source of peroxygen at a level required for either effective bleaching without a transition metal catalyst, or which would provide an increase in effectiveness of bleaching in the presence of a transition metal catalyst as defined herein." Therefore, as will be further described herein below, effective bleaching of stains can be accomplished by simply adding an aqueous or non aqueous solution of a catalyst as described herein to fabric which is stained, preferably the fabric is in an aqueous solution when contacted with the catalyst. However, it is recognized that because of factors outside the control of the formulator inter alia source of product raw materials, unwanted decomposition of one or more ingredients, that a source of peroxygen may be introduced and/or formed unknowingly in the product. The compositions of the present invention do not require any peroxygen source, but the presence of any minor amounts will not effect the performance of the bleaching compositions described herein.<br>
Formulators may typically include a small amount of a source of hydrogen peroxide into compositions for the purposes of stabilizing enzymes, for example, a minor amount of perborate may be added. However, this amount of perborate is typically so minor that it has no effect on the bleaching capacity of the compositions of the present invention. In cases where the formulator has added a minor amount of an oxidant, or other source of peroxide for the purposes of stabilizing an adjunct ingredient, for the purposes of the present invention, those compositions art still defined as "substantially free" of a source of peroxygen as defined herein above if they do not provide additional bleaching activity on stains under typical use conditions. For example, a "substantially free" composition can include an amount of peroxygen source provided the degree to which the catalyst is effective is substantially the same as if the source of peroxygen were absent. For the purposes of the present invention, any composition which comprises less than 0.1%, preferably less than 0.01% of a primary oxidant, such as a pre formed peracid or a source of hydrogen peroxide is considered "substantially free" as further defined herein above. Additionally, any laundry liquor, laundry wash water, pre soak bath, or other fabric or surface cleaning solution, wherein the present catalysts are used and which comprises less than 0.001% by weight of a source of peroxygen, pre formed or otherwise formed in situ, is defined herein as "substantially free" as defined herein above. Stated otherwise, if the catalysts of the present invention are used to bleach stains on fabric, or otherwise clean/bleach a hard surface or dishware, and the solution containing the catalyst has a concentration of a source of peroxygen legs than 0.001%, that solution is defined herein as "substantially free" of a source of peroxygen. Bleach Catalyst<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of a bleach catalyst. The term "an effective amount" is defined as "an amount of the transition metal bleach catalyst present in the present invention compositions, or during use according to the present invention methods, that is sufficient, under whatever comparative or use conditions are entployed, to result in at least partial oxidation of the material sought to be oxidized by the composition or method." Typically the material to be oxidized is an unwanted substance inter alia food and beverage stains, greasy/oily stains, body soils on fabric, however, this is not the limitation to which the invention is applicable. Oxidation in the absence of a source of peroxygen has wide applicability and the present invention is not limited solely to bleaching and/or cleaning o f fabric, For example , auiomatic dishwashing compositions  are an embadiment of the present invention wherein bleaching of a stain with a composition and/or with a solution which is "substantially free" of a source of peroxygen is a part of the present invention. The<br>
same is equally true for hard surface cleaning compositions and solutions which comprise hard surface cleaning compositions which are "substantially free" of a source of peroxygen.<br>
Preferably the compositions of the present invention comprise from about 1 ppb (0.0600001%), more preferably from about 100 ppb (0.00001%), yet more preferably from about 500 ppb (0.00005%), still more preferably from about 1 ppm (0.0001%) to about 99.9%, more preferably to about 50%, yet more preferably to about 5%, still more preferably to about 500 ppm (0.05%) by weight of the composition, of a transition metal bleach catalyst as described herein below.<br>

ffdm about 10% to about 80%, more typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and alurmnosilicates. However, non phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839 Rieck, issued May 12, 1987. NaSK.S 6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS 6").<br>

Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations. Di persants<br>
A description of other suitable polyalkyleneimine dispersants which may be optionally combined with the bleach stable dispersants of the present invention can be found in U.S. 4,597,898 Vander Meer, issued July 1, 1986; European Patent Application 111,965 Oh and GoBselink, published June 27,1984; European Patent Application 111,984 Gosselink, published June 27, 1984; European Patent Application 112,592 Gosselink, published July 4, 1984; U.S. 4,548,744 Connor, issued October 22, 1985; and U.S. 5,565,145 Watson et al., issued October 15, 1996; all of which are included herein by reference.

Unsaturated monomcnc acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesacomc acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein or monomeric segments, containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrcnc, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40°'o by weight.<br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylatcs can be derived from acrylic acid.

Acrylic/maleic based.copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti redeposition agent. Such materials include the water soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000, preferably from about 5,000, more preferably from about 7,000 to 100,000, more preferably to 75,000, most preferably to 65,000.

1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Water soluble salts of such acrylic acid/maleic acid copolymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15,1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September .3,1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate. Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers. Such materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.<br>
Polyaspartate and polyglutamate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders. Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000.<br>
Soil Release Agents<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may optionally comprise one or more soil release agents. If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01%, preferably from about 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably to about 5%, more preferably to about 3% by weight, of the composition. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobie fibers, such as polyester and nylon,and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of the laundry cycle and, thus. serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments.

Amylases (a and/or 6) can be included for removal of carbohydrate-based stains. WO94/02597 describes cleaning compositions which incorporate mutant amylases. See also WO95/10603. Other amylases known for use in cleaning compositions include both a- and (3-amylases. a-Amylases are known in the art and include those disclosed in US Pat. no. 5,003,257: EP 252,666; WO/91/00353; FR 2,676,456; EP 285,123; EP 525,610; EP 368,341; and British Patent specification no. 1,296,839 (Novo). Other suitable amylases are stability-enhanced amylases described in W094/18314 and WO96/05295, Genencor, and amylase variants having additional modification in the immediate parent available from Novo Nordisk A/S, disclosed in WO 95/10603. Also suitable are amylases described in EP 277 216.<br>
Examples of commercial a-amylases products are Purafect Ox Am® from Genencor and<br>
Termamyl®, Ban® .Fungamyl® and Duramyl®, all available from Novo Nordisk A/S Denmark. W095/26397 describes other suitable amylases : a-amylases characterised by having a specific<br>
activity at least 25% higher than the specific activity of Termamyl® at a temperature range of 25°<br>
C to 55°C and at a pH value in the range of 8 to 10, measured by the Phadebas® a-amylase activity assay. Suitable are variants of the above enzymes, described in WO96/23873 (Novo <br>
Notdisk). Other amylolytic enzymes with improved properties with respect to the activity level and the combination of thermostability and a higher activity level are described in WO95/35382.<br>

The above-mentioned enzymes may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Origin can further be mesophilic or extremophilic (psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, thermophilic, barophilic, alkalophilic, acidophilic, halophilic, etc.). Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Nowadays, it is common practice to modify wild-type enzymes via protein / genetic engineering techniques in order to optimize their performance efficiency in the laundry detergent and/or fabric care compositions of the invention. For example, the variants may be designed such that the compatibility of the enzyme to commonly encountered ingredients of such compositions is increased. Alternatively, the variant may be designed such that the optimal pH, bleach or chelant stability, catalytic activity and the like, of the enzyme variant is tailored to suit the particular cleaning application.<br>
In particular, attention should be focused on amino acids sensitive to oxidation in the case of bleach stability and on surface charges for the surfactant compatibility. The isoelectric point of such enzymes may be modified by the substitution of some charged amino acids, e.g. an increase in isoelectric point may help to improve compatibility with anionic surfactants. The stability of the enzymes may be further enhanced by the creation of e.g. additional salt bridges and enforcing calcium binding sites to increase chelant stability.<br>
These optional detersive enzymes, when present, are normally incorporated in the cleaning composition at levels from 0.0001% to 2% of pure enzyme by weight of the cleaning composition. The enzymes can be added as separate single ingredients (prills, granulates, stabilized liquids, etc... containing one enzyme ) or as mixtures of two or more enzymes (e.g. cogranulates).<br>
Other suitable detergent ingredients that can be added are enzyme oxidation scavengers. Examples of such enzyme oxidation scavengers are ethoxylated tetraethylene polyamines.<br>
