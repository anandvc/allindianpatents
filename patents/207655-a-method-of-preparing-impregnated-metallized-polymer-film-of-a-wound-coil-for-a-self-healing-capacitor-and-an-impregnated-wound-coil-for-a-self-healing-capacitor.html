The present invention relates to the field of electrical capacitors. More specifically, it relates to insulating fluids for use in impregnation of the wound coils of self-healing capacitors having metallized<br>
plates.<br>
By self-healing capacitor is meant in the present context capacitors which include at least one plate comprising a very thin layer of metal of a few hundred angstroms in thickness, the main property of which is that, when the capacitor breaks down, the said plate volatilizes at the point where the said breakdown occurs. This plate may either be a thin layer of metal, such as aluminum or zinc or an alloy of these two metals, deposited directly on a polymer film, such as polypropylene or polyester, which constitutes the solid dielectric, or may be deposited on both facns of a paper, this plate then being associated with one or more polymer tilmo which act as a dielectric. In the latter case, the doubly-metallized paper does not act a s  a d i a J. e c t r i c .<br>
The wound coils of these capacitors are advantageously impregnated with an insulating fluid. Impregnation typically takes place after the solid materials nave been wound, by introducing, under reduced pressure, an insulating fluid which, at the time of impregnation, is in the form of a low-viscosity liquid. Once the impregnation has been completed, the<br><br>
capacitors may undergo a heat treatment. This is necessary when the insulating fluid consists of systems having 2 polycondensable and/or croBslinkable components which are to a greater or lesser extent charged with an inert liquid so as to minimize the shrinkage -<br>
The Applicant Company has observed that, when the impregnation of the metallized polymer films of the wound coils tor self-healing capacitors is carried out using certain aromatic liquids, such as mixtures of mono- and dibenzyltoluene, phenylxyly]ethanes, the said capacitors have a very short lifetime under voltage.<br>
It. has aow been discovered that it is possible to use, for the impregnation of the metallized polymer films of the wound coils for self-healing capacitors, at least one insulating fluid selected from the group consisting of aliphatic esters, alkylbenzenes, crosslinkable compositions comprising at least one polydiene pclyol, at least on
Regarding the aliphatic esters, the compounds used in the present invention are preferably dioctyl sebacate, dioctyl adipate, dibutyl sebacate and diethyl succinate -<br>
Among these compounds, dibutyl sebacate is meet particularly prrsferrud.<br>
Regarding the crosslinkable composition* which can be used according to the present; invention.<br><br>
it is preferred to use those which comprise at least one polydiene polyol, at least one polyisocyanate having a functionality greater than 2 and a quantity of inert liquid charge at least equal to 80% by weight of the composition so as to maintain a viscosity of less than 100 mPa*s throughout the duration of the impregnation,<br>
The chemically inert liquid charge is an insulating liquid, which can completely dissolve the polydiene polyols and the polyisocyanates and may be selected from alkylbenzenes, such as decylbenzanes and dodecylbenzenes; dielectric esters which are, for example, products of the reaction of polyvalent alcohols, such as pentaerythritol, with monovalent carboxylic acids, such as n-heptanoic acid; aliphatic esters, such as dioctyl sebacateP dioctyl adipate and dibutyl sebacate; alkyl phthalates, such as dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate; alkylpolyaromati r. compounds, such as monoisopropylbiphenyl (MIPB); vegetable oils, such as colza oils, mai2e oils and soya oils, as well as the combination of at least, two of the ribovementioned insulating liquids.<br>
Preferably, aliphatic esters, such as dibutyl sebacate and dioctyl adipate, alkyl phthalates, such as dioctyl phthalate, or vegetable oils, such as colza oil, will be used as the chemically inert liquid charge.<br>
The polyisocyanate used to produce the usable<br><br>
crosslinkabie composition according to the present invention may be selected from aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic poiyisocyanates and those polyisocyanatea which contain in their molecule an ieocyanurate ring, having at least two isocyanate functional groups in their molecule, these being able to react with hydroxyl functional groups of a polyol in order to form a three-dimensional polyurethane network causing the composition to gel.<br>
By way of illustration of aromatic polyiso-cyanates, mention will be made of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), polymeric MDIs and triphenylmethane tviisocyanate.<br>
By way of illustration of an aliphatic<br>
polyisocyanate, mention may be made of the biuret of<br><br>
poiyisocyanates, mention may be made of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI)/ cyclohexyl diisocyanate (CHDI) and 4,4' -dicyclohexyimethane diisocyanate.<br>
By way ofc illustration of poiyisocyanates which contain in their molecule the isocyanurafce ring, mention may be made of the trimers of hexamefchylene diisocyanate which are sold by Rhone-Pouleno under the<br><br>
name TOLONATE HDT and tri socyanatomethyl)-1,3,3 â€¢ trimethylcyclohexane] iaocyanurate sold by Huls under the name VESTANAT T 1890/100.<br>
The amount of polyisocyanate is suitably choaen in such a way that the NCO/OH molar ratio ie about 1 and ia preferably between 0.85 and 1.15.<br>
The poly-ileus polyol in suitably a hydroxytelechelic conjugated-diene oligomer* which may be obtained by various processes, such as the radical polymerization of a conjugated diene having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms in the presence of a polymerization initiator, such aÂ» hydrogen peroxide, or an azo compound, such as 2,2-azobis [2-methyl-NÂ» (2-hydroxyet;hyl)propionamide] , or the anionic polymerization of a conjugated diene having from 4 to 2 0 carbon atoms in the presence of a catalyst, nuch as; dilithium naphthalene.<br>
According to the present invention, the conjugated diene of the polydiene polyol iÂ« selected xroni the group comprising butadiene, inopreno, chioroprene, 1,3-pentadiene and cyclopentadiene.<br>
It is also possible to une hydroxytelechelic oligomers of conjugated dienes which are epoxidized along the chain, as well as hydroxytelechelic hydrogenated oligomers of conjugated dnenes.<br>
The polyaifane pulyols may have number-average molar masses at most equal to 7000 and preferably of between 1000 and 3000, They suitably have<br><br>
functionalities ranging from 1.8 to 3 and a dynamic viscosity measured at 30Â°C at least equal to 600 mPa,s.<br>
By way of illustration of polydiene polyols, mention may be made of the hydroxylated polybutadienes sold by Elf Atochem S.A. under the names PolyBd* 45 HT and PolyBd* 20 LM.<br>
The crosslinkable composition may comprise, in addition to the polydiene polyol, one or more polyols of low molarmaon.<br>
By polyols of low molar mass are meant polyols having molar masses ranging from 50 to 800,<br>
By way of illustration of such polyols, mention may be made of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polye therpolyols, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol, N,N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)-aniline, 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, propoxylated bisphenol A sold by Akzo under the name DIANOI. 320, and the mixtixre of at least two aforementioned polyols.<br>
In the case in which a polyol of low molar mass is used, the NCO/OH molar ratio will have to he calculated taking into account the hydroxylated functional groups provided by the said polyol of low molar maasâ€¢<br>
Although the use of a catalyst is not absolutely essential, it will be possible, in some Gases, if desired, to use a catalyst of the<br><br>
organometallic type, such as dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL), dibutyltin acetate or organic derivatives of bismuth.<br>
The unable crowslinkable composition according to the present invention may bo produced by mixing, at room temperature (approximately 20Â°C), the various constituents using any means of stirring sufficient to ensure gcod dispersion of the constituents. The* crosslinfcable composition may also contain one or more additives, such as antioxidants, an epoxide or anthrraqinone.<br>
The inert charge may optionally undergo a dielectx-ie treatment on an adsorbent earth.<br>
The wound Ooils impregnated by mcann of the ixiaulating fluids according to the present invention have the advantage of withstanding high voltage gradients.<br>
In the rase of the crosslinkabi compostitions, compositions, the capacitors obtained furthermore have the advantage of no longer having free liquid capable of contaminating the environment should th*r
In addition, this absence of fre<s liquid gives the capacitors improved fire-reststanas properties because there is no possibility of burning being projected should capacitor explode.></s>
