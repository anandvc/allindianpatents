Field of the Invention<br>
This application is patent of addition to our co-pending application No. 1462/CHE/2005. The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Ceftiofur sodium. The present invention more particularly provides a process for crystallizing Ceftiofur sodium directly from the reaction mass.<br>
 <br>
Ceftiofur, a semi synthetic cephalosporin, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains and anaerobes. Its antibacterial activity results from the inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis in the cell wall in a similar fashion to other cephalosporins. Ceftiofur is used in the treatment of respiratory infections in cattle and pigs. The chemical designation is [6R-[6a,7b(z)]]-7-[[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[2-furanylcarbonyl)thio]methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-l-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid. The sodium and hydrochloride salts are administered intramuscularly and intravenously.<br>
Ceftiofur is first disclosed in US patent no. 4,464,367 which also discloses a process for preparing Ceftiofur and its sodium salt.<br>
 <br>
US patent No. 4,902,683 claims crystalline hydrochloride salt of Ceftiofur. According to this patent the conventional free acid and its sodium salt are unstable and are obtained as amorphous nature.<br>
US patent No. 4,937,330 claims a process for the preparation of Ceftiofur sodium, by neutralizing the hydro halide salt of Ceftiofur sodium using poly vinyl pyridine.<br>
WO 02/42266 claims a process for the production of Ceftiofur sodium treating the Ceftiofur hydrochloride with sodium source, separating sodium chloride using appropriate membrane (reverse osmosis technique to remove sodium chloride), and isolating Ceftiofur sodium by lyophilization.<br>
US 6,458,949 discloses a process in which after completion of cyclization with thiourea in example 1, sodium chloride was added into reaction mass, the resultant by-phasic layer was separated, followed by addition of sodium 2-ethyl hexonate to yield Ceftiofur sodium.<br>
US 6,555,680 discloses a process in which Ceftiofur sodium was prepared from Ceftiofur amine salt, however the complexity associated with work up procedure makes this process unfavorable for plant point of view.<br>
Conventional process reported for the preparation of Ceftiofur sodium involves dissolution of Ceftiofur acid in a solvent like acetone, methanol, THF, water or mixtures thereof using an organic amine followed by the addition of sodium salt of weak acid like sodium 2-ethyl hexonate or neutralizing the Ceftiofur<br>
 <br>
hydro halide salt with sodium ion source followed by converting the acid into Ceftiofur sodium by using membrane filtration.<br>
In our continued research we have identified an improved process for the crystallization of Ceftiofur sodium directly from the reaction mixture, which obviates the complexity, associated with the normal work up procedure, and yield Ceftiofur sodium with good purity and yield None of the prior art suggests or even motivates the present invention.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to provide an improved process for the crystallization of Ceftiofur sodium of formula (I) with good purity directly from the reaction mixture.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a commercial process for the direct isolation of Ceftiofur sodium with out converting the Ceftiofur sodium into acid addition salt.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Ceftiofur sodium that obviates the use of amine, sodium salt of weak acid like sodium 2-ethylhexonate and membrane filtration.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Ceftiofur sodium of formula (I)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
the said process comprising the steps of:<br>
i)        preparing Ceftiofur sodium in the presence or absence of water<br>
miscible organic solvent and water, in the presence of sodium ion<br>
source by acylating FURACA of formula (II),<br>
 <br>
ii)       optionally removing the organic solvent,<br>
iii) optionally adding alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts selected from group comprising of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulphate, sodium bromide and potassium/sodium dihydrgen orthophospate or mixture there of, and<br>
iv)      isolating Ceftiofur sodium of formula (I) by filtration.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, acylation of FURACA of formula (II) is carried out either by approach 1 or by approach 2 as depicted in scheme (I), by utilizing the conventional processes known in the literature or as described in our co-pending application No. 1417/CHE/2005.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Approach 1 involves direct acylation with 7-aminothiazole substituent of formula (III) with FURACA of formula (II) yields Ceftiofur of formula (I), and approach two involves acylating the FURACA with compound of formula (IV) followed by cyclizing the ensuing compound of formula (V) with thiourea to yield Ceftiofur of formula (I). There are several literature suggests or teaches the reaction conditions for both approaches and the same could be followed to prepare Ceftiofur sodium. The present invention particularly provides direct isolation Ceftiofur sodium from the reaction mass by filtration, which avoids lyophilization or reverse osmosis technique.<br>
 <br>
In another embodiment of the present invention of the approach 1 the reaction mass was treated using solvent like ethyl acetate or dichloromethane in order to remove the by-products obtained.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the Ceftiofur sodium is isolated directly from the reaction mass comprising water miscible organic solvent like THF, acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, diglyme, butanone, dioxane, DMF, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and the like; and water with out using reverse osmosis technique, or solvent precipitation technique, or lyophilization technique or weak salt- strong salt relationship technique. Accordingly the present invention provides a crystallization of Ceftiofur sodium directly from reaction mass which comprises crystallizing Ceftiofur sodium from the reaction mass comprising water, and/or water miscible organic solvent, sodium ion source base, and optionally inorganic salt selected from group consisting of sodium chloride, sodium sulphate, sodium bromide, and the like, and/or reaction impurities with out using techniques like reverse osmosis, or solvent precipitation, or lyophilization or   weak salt- strong salt relationship.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the present invention avoids the reverse osmosis techniques like membrane filtration technique, which is essential for conventional processes to removal of inorganic salt like sodium chloride. Accordingly, the present invention also avoids the lyophilization technique.<br>
 <br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the present invention avoids the conventional technique of isolating Ceftiofur acid and dissolving the Ceftiofur acid with amine to form amine salt further replacing the amine with sodium by using weak salt - strong salt relationship.<br>
The conventional process of preparing highly pure sodium involves converting Ceftiofur into Ceftiofur hydro halide, and converting Ceftiofur hydrochloride into Ceftiofur sodium either by polyvinyl resin treatment or by treating with silylating agents or using membrane filtration obtained. But according to the present invention the purity of Ceftiofur sodium is achieved by direct isolation, there by avoids the complexity associated with the work up procedure and also conventional process requires more time because of the cumbersome workup associated with it and occupy more reactor space in plant. Hence present invention is not only provides Ceftiofur sodium with good quality but also provides a commercially importance process.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the organic solvent from step (ii) was optionally removed by distillation or by adding sufficient amount of sodium chloride to reaction mass to form by-phasic layer and separating the water miscible organic layer.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, crystallization of Ceftiofur sodium from the reaction mass contains water miscible organic solvent and water is effected by means of cooling the reaction mass to -5° C to 15° C or by the addition of alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts selected from group comprising of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulphate, sodium bromide and potassium/sodium dihydrgen orthophospate or mixtures thereof; and crystallization<br>
 <br>
of Ceftiofur sodium from the reaction mass contains water only was effected by the addition of alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts for example sodium chloride (ltime with respect to Furaca) or sodium bromide (1 time with respect to Furaca) or sodium sulphate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the Ceftiofur sodium obtained as per this invention is in crystalline form (as claimed in our co-pending application No.l462/CHE/2005) or amorphous form or mixture of amorphous form with crystalline form; and can be converted into crystalline Ceftiofur sodium as claimed in our co-pending application by utilizing the process given in our copending application 1462/CHE/2005.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the sodium ion source base employed is selected from sodium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium 2-ethyl hexonate, sodium carbonate, sodium lactate and the like.<br>
The starting material of the present invention can be prepared by utilizing the process available in the prior art.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the Ceftiofur sodium obtained can be converted into Stable Sterile Ceftiofur sodium or Ceftiofur HC1.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention the Ceftiofur sodium obtained according to the present invention having good stability over conventional Ceftiofur sodium also having less residual solvent over<br>
 <br>
Many other beneficial results can be obtained by applying disclosed invention in a different manner or by modifying the invention with the scope of disclosure.<br>
