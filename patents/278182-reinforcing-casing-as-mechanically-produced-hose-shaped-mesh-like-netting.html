				<td>Reinforcing casing, particularly for sausage products<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a reinforcing casing as mechanically produced hose-shaped, meshlike netting, the mesh bars - which are formed from at least two threads - of which are connected together at the crossing points, wherein the mesh bars extend in longitudinal and transverse direction with respect to the inserted round and stretched filling body.<br>
A reinforcing casing of the kind according to category is known from DE 1 798 085 U1. Such reinforcing casings are drawn over, in particular, preserved sausage products, such as, for example, salami sausage or the like, which are filled into sausage-skin or hose-like casings.<br>
The reinforcing casing consists of a reticular textile thread composite.   The reinforcing casings are provided, in particular, to enable stacking of the sausage products one on the other for the purpose of transport.   The reinforcing casings prevent the sausage-skin or hose-like casings of the lower sausage products from being split by the weight of the sausage products stacked thereupon.  Moreover, the sausage product is held in stretched form and even in the case of greater weight can be suspended without the casing being damaged.   It is additionally known from the specification to make reinforcing casings of that kind from so-called hand-tied Milanese nets or, however, also by machine.   For this purpose the reinforcing casing is constructed as a mechanically produced hose-shaped meshlike netting, the mesh bars - which are formed by at least two threads - of which are connected together at the crossing points.   The possibility of a substantially cheaper production and adaptation to the different sizes and forms of the sausage products, particularly preserved sausage products, thereby results. The mesh bars can in that case extend diagonally in such a manner that the crossing points thereof are arranged at a row extending in longitudinal direction of the sausage product and are interconnected by a further mesh bar extending in longitudinal direction of the sausage product, whereby the possibility is created of also being able to hang very long and heavy sausage products at the end, which is tied together at the sausage end, of the reinforcing casing.  Moreover, it is known from the specification to so construct the diagonal mesh bars that they run out at their ends respectively into rod bars which extend in longitudinal direction of the sausage<br>
product and in which the threads of the diagonal mesh bars are braided together so that the mesh bars extending in longitudinal direction have twice the thickness of the diagonal mesh bars. A particularly strong reinforcing casing is created in that the mesh bars extend substantially at right angles to one another and run in longitudinal and transverse direction of the sausage in such a manner that the rod bars extending in longitudinal direction have threads braided together. An extremely strong reinforcing casing is thereby given and the possibility is created of being able to stack the sausages, particularly in the case of loading on ships or railways vehicles, particularly high. The threads used are non-elastic threads.<br>
A reinforcing casing as a sausage casing is similarly known from DE 91 07 065 U1, in which the casing body is divided at least once in hose longitudinal direction and the casing body is connected along its longitudinal regions, which lie in the region of the division, by a thread which is led through the casing body without tying substantially in such a manner that it is withdrawable in longitudinal direction. The indicated reinforcing body otherwise serves for the same, already-described purpose.<br>
A reinforcing casing in the form of a sausage net is also known from DE 29 12 961 C2 and DE 29 25 600 C2. The reinforcing casing consists of a hose net of laced or raschel-knitted stitches with at least two limbs each of at least one thread of textile material.   In the first-mentioned specification at least one thread of elastomenc material is provided in each limb of the stitch, together with the textile threads.   In the second-mentioned specification at least one thread of elastomeric material is introduced only into one limb of each stitch, in at least one perpendicularly and/or transversely extending stitch row.    The threads of elastomeric material have the effect that the stiffening casing bears against the sausage casing even during the shrinking process or after the shrinking process of the filled sausage.  The introduced non-elastic fibre has the effect that during filling of the sausage skin or the sausage casing the reinforcing casing does not stretch therewith, so that bulges which protrude from the plane of the netting and which are separated from one another by groove-shaped depressions in which the stitch limbs lie can form in the stitch region of the reinforcing casing. Depending on the respective construction of the stitches or of the fields bounded by the reticulation, different optical effects are given by the sausage bulges.<br>
An elastic reinforcement for sausages and meat products with a reticular structure is additionally known from DE 1 951 900 U1. This consists of a hose-like stitched net of textile single threads or yams and is drawn over the sausage product or meat product.<br>
The stitches of the net have a rhombic shape and the stitch-forming limbs preferably extend diagonally with respect to the hose axis. The stitch limbs are formed from highly twisted, crinkled fully synthetic threads.<br>
An elastic hose-shaped net for binding sausage products or the like is additionally known from AT 300 534 C.<br>
All known reinforcing casings are subject to the disadvantage that they can in general only be used for sausage products and meat products which have a stretched, almost rectilinear fillable shape. Accordingly, the known reinforcing casings cannot be used for sausage products and meat products which have or are to have a curved form. Preserved sausage products filled into skin-like natural or synthetic casings can, however, also have curved shapes. Moreover, casings are often desired which have a curved shape relating to the natural shape.<br>
The invention has the object of indicating a reinforcing casing which can be used for imposing the shape of curved sausage and meat products and can be produced simply and economically, including by machine.<br>
The invention fulfils the object by configuring the reinforcing casing according to the technical teaching indicated in claim 1, according to which the netting curved or wave-shaped in longitudinal direction and consisting of joined-together curved parts is constructed to extend in two or three axial planes. A curved shape is thus not achieved by utilisation of possible differences in elasticity of the netting, but through presets in the production of the netting this is constructed to be so curved in longitudinal direction that the curved shape of the sausage product or meat product is defined by the netting itself. The reinforcing netting can beyond that consist of different curved parts which are produced to be connected together so that a wave-shaped structure is given. This wave-shaped structure can extend in two or, however, also in three axial planes, wherein the construction in three axial planes means that the reinforcing casing is constructed to be screwdriver-shaped. In addition, it is apparent that a circular form can be realised by appropriate production of the net. It is also apparent that even in the case of a non-elastic casing of the filling body an imparting of shape necessarily takes place through the fixed geometry of the reinforcing casing. If beyond that the casing of the filling body consists of stretchable material it is apparent that bulges, which are optically pronounced, beyond the<br>
net structure can be produced under pressure during the filling process, wherein these are characterised by the fields bounded by longitudinal and transverse threads or stitch webs. The use of a thread combination of a non-elastic and an elastic thread is particularly suitable for this purpose, so that even after the shrinking process of the product the net continues to bear against the casing of the filling body, for example also in the grooves which bound the fields and which automatically arise in the filling process. If beyond that the threads provided in longitudinal direction additionally extend in longitudinal twist it is possible to achieve, apart from a curved, wave-shaped or screwdriver-shaped disposition, a further additional optical twist effect at the surface. In that case, with appropriate selection of material of the casing of the filling body, bulges can emerge which extend in a twist over the surface of the curved part.<br>
In the production of a reinforcing coating according to the invention it is important to draw the threads through at defined speeds in dependence on their positioning and depending on their course or to conduct them from the knotting or tying point to the next knotting or tying point in order to achieve in desired manner increased or shortened length sections to the next knotting point. This controlled feed, or the controlled drawing-through at different speeds, is produced either by drive control or by use of special transport roller tracks for the individual threads, which respectively run at the same rotational speeds or at speeds with controlled change or which have different diameters. If beyond that individual controls by means of electric motors are possible, the transit speeds can also be controlled in dependence on the pattern of the netting in such a manner that desired field blanks or meshes of the netting are given, for example rectangular, square, lozenge-shaped, oval or also round fields, which produce special optical effects. The stitch webs can be strengthened in that the stitch size or the field size of the field lying between the bars are selected to be of such a size that the sausage product can protrude in bulge-shaped manner together with its casing.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are indicated in the subclaims in detail.<br>
In principle, the invention permits production of nettings on, for example, bobbin lace machines, which have mutually adjoining curved shapes, for example curved shapes extending in S shape not only in one direction, but also in the other direction. Even round shapes can be realised. Moreover, the production on bobbin lace machines of that kind also permits production of different sizes of diameter and fixing the length of the transverse<br>
threads. Moreover, the outlet ends given in longitudinal direction can be reduced in diameter in sections by the transverse threads so as to enable, for example, better adaptation in shape in the outlet region of the casing, which is of sausage-skin kind, of a sausage product. A particularly continuous production is made possible if the threads extending in longitudinal direction are arcuately arranged about a notional centre point in such a manner that the thread or threads extending at the inner side is or are shorter than the threads extending arcuately on the outer paths. The longitudinal threads are connected together by the tied threads which extend in transverse direction and which after drawing over onto a filling body impose an arcuate shape thereon or have approximately the same circumferential lengths.<br>
For example, they can be connected together in netlike manner. Bindings in a bobbin lace machine can be realised, wherein the threads extending in transverse direction form curved segments between the longitudinal threads, which segments are determined by the length of the succeeding longitudinal threads and by the curve angle and the respective effective radius resulting from the position of the longitudinal thread on the circumference of the transverse threads. The actual length is determined by the excess lengths, which are at the end, of the curve angle amount going out beyond the filling body. The curve angle size can be, for example, 30° or 40°. The size of the radius R1 thus also determines the effective radii of the further longitudinal threads which are tied together within the scope of the curve dimension and form the net. On application of longitudinal threads and transverse threads it is possible in that case to produce not only a trapezium-shaped, but also a lozenge-shaped reticulated structure. Reinforced yarns can equally well be used for the longitudinal threads.<br>
The advantageous forms of embodiment of the reinforced coating constructed in accordance with the invention are individually indicated in detail in the subclaims.<br>
Production can, however, also be carried out on double-rib looms or on other knitting machines, which in suitable manner enable control of the transit speeds of the individual threads.<br>
Use is usually made of non-elastic threads and yarns for production of the net. However, threads and yams with limited elasticity can also be used, which, for example, permit stretching to a certain extent, but beyond that behave as if rigid so that on drawing of such<br>
 reinforced casing onto the filling casing of a sausage product compensation can be provided for tolerances. Extensibility should then lie in the millimetre range. The longitudinal threads and/or the threads in transverse direction can be yams which contain shrink fibres. Such yarns are known. The shrink fibres have the characteristic that they shrink to a certain extent through ultraviolet radiation, heat, cooling or longer storage times. The use of such yarns has the advantage that when the filling body, for example a salami-type product, shrinks due to longer drying the net is adapted or automatically adapts to the smaller diameter. Such yams can contain, for example, bi-component fibres, the individual filaments of which are composed of at least two different part filaments which in turn consist of two different polyesters/polymers.<br>
The excess length going beyond the curves is particularly suitable for enabling, through knotting, a secure reinforcement of the sausage product or meat product even in longitudinal direction. In a simplest form of embodiment, for example, three longitudinal threads connected with the transverse threads are arranged to be distributed at 120° on a diameter of approximately 7 centimetres to 8 centimetres. It is also possible to provide only one inner and one outer longitudinal thread. However, usually four longitudinal threads and a specific number of transverse threads are used for production of the net in order to achieve defined lozenge-shaped or trapezium-shaped field sizes. In addition, at least two longitudinal threads can be arranged parallel to one another at a small spacing, wherein parallel arrangements of that kind can be provided to be distributed on the circumferential path around the filling body. Primarily, the visual impression is thereby changed, but at the same time the pressing area is increased. Different transit speeds or draw-out speeds of the longitudinal threads must, in addition, be observed with these parallel arrangements. •<br>
Instead of transverse threads, it is also possible for other, lozenge-shaped lattices with rhombic shapes to be knitted or laced between the longitudinal threads. Production of the curvature takes place in the simplest manner by feed of the longitudinal guides in the knitting or bobbin lace machine at different speeds. The feed of the yarn or the threads at the inwardly disposed side takes place more slowly relative to the next one. The succeeding longitudinal thread is thus drawn into the machine more quickly. This stops running through after each grid pitch and produces the connection between the transverse threads and the longitudinal threads at the tying point. The fourth longitudinal thread has to be drawn in even more quickly, since it is removed again in order to achieve the desired<br>
length extent so that the curved shape is secured.<br>
Other filling bodies, for example also in the form of an air balloon, instead of the mentioned sausage and meat products can obviously also be surrounded by a reinforcing casing. The created net structure can thus be used with adaptation on all curved products and casings. Equally, instead of the indicated division a double, triple or quadruple division or also a quintuple, sextuple, septuple or octuple division of the circumferential path of the transversely extending threads can be effected or also the introduction of another, smaller net structure between the longitudinal threads. In that case it is obvious that in correspondence with these forms of shape and shape sizes the feed speeds of the longitudinal threads have to be controlled in such a manner that imposition of the desired curved shape is ensured.<br>
The invention is further explained in the following by way of the examples of embodiment illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>

A sausage, for example a preserved sausage, which is filled into a casing 1, is depicted in Figure 1. The casing 1 can be, for example, a prefabricated textile casing or also a natural skin. It is tied at the head end. An end 2 is created by the tying. The illustrated sausage is surrounded by a curved reinforcing casing 3, produced in accordance with the invention, in the form of a meshlike netting. This netting has longitudinal threads 4a, 4b and 4c. In<br>
this case there are four longitudinal threads which are arranged to be respectively offset by 90° around the circumference of the reinforcing casing, wherein one longitudinal thread is not visible. The longitudinal threads consist of yarns, which can also be reinforced. The longitudinal threads 4a, 4b and 4c (the rear longitudinal thread cannot be seen) are connected together by transverse threads 5. The transverse threads 5 are each arranged to be encircling and fofm, in each instance with the adjacent longitudinal threads 4a, 4b, 4c, trapezium-shaped fields 6 which reinforce a part section of the sausage casing 1. The length of the reinforcing casing 3 is determined by the curve angle q&gt; and by the excess length serving at the lower end and the excess length 8, which is knotted at the end, at the upper end.<br>
In order to obtain the curved shape on a knitting or bobbin lace machine the longitudinal threads 4a, 4b, 4c drawn into the machine are drawn in at different speeds. The inwardly disposed longitudinal thread 4a, which extends in a curve with the notional radius R1, is drawn into the machine relatively slowly, whereas the middle longitudinal thread 4c with the effective radius Refn is drawn in more rapidly, so that the desired trapezium fields can arise and the curved shape is guaranteed. The outer longitudinal thread 4b is drawn in even more quickly so as to better connect this, at the notional radius Reff2, with the transverse threads 5. During the connecting the running through briefly stops and the longitudinal threads 4a, 4b, 4c then run through at the different speeds for tying to the transverse threads 5. The net, as it is illustrated, thereby arises in desired manner. It is obviously also possible to entirely dispense with the excess lengths 7 and 8 or the transverse threads 9 and 10 can be constructed to be shortened in the excess lengths 7 and 8. Equally, the transverse threads can also be reinforced yam. This depends on the respective use.<br>
A wave shape of a reinforcing casing is illustrated in Figure 2. This imposes, during filling, on the casing of the filling body the shape of the sausage product in two planes.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example in three axial planes, from which it is apparent that through joining together or through an endless production it is possible to produce a reinforcing casing in screw-shaped structures, which casing, during filling, imposes the sausage shape on the casing of the filling body.<br>
Figure 4 indicates a net structure in which the longitudinal threads 12 are surrounded on<br>
the one hand by elastic threads 13 and on the other hand the elastic threads 13 are worked in as transverse threads, so that a drawing together in both directions is guaranteed when the sausage product shrinks due to drying. In that case longitudinal threads can be worked in together or provided to be continuous. Beyond that it is possible to construct respective transverse threads, which ensure encasing, to be elastic or to provide them to be additionally non-elastic in order to produce, after the shrinking process, bearing of the net against the casing. Diverse possibilities are available to the expert, which are indicated in, for example DE 29 25 600 C2 and DE 29 12 961 C2.<br>
Figure 5 shows another pattern of a tubular knit according to the invention, which is characterised by higher area coverage.<br>
