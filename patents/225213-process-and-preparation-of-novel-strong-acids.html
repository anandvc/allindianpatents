				<td>The present invention relates to acids of the general formula [1]<br>
where <br>
y=1,2 or 3,<br>
and in which<br>
the ligands R may be identical or different, and<br>
R is a perfluorinated C1-8-alkyl or aryl group or R is a partially fluorinated<br>
C1-8-alkyl or aryl group in which some of the F or H may have been<br>
substituted by chlorine.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of the<br>
acids according to the invention, to salts comprising a cation and the anion of one<br>
of the acids according to the invention, and to a process for the preparation of the<br>
salts. The invention furthermore relates to the use of the acids and metal salts<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Hexafluorophosphoric acid, HPF6, is used as a catalyst in organic chemistry or as<br>
a starting compound for the preparation of various salts. In the industry,<br>
hexafluorophosphoric acid is obtained by reaction [1] of phosphorus pentoxide<br>
and anhydrous hydrofluoric acid.<br>
P4O10 + 24 HF -&gt; 4 HPF6 + 10H2O<br>
		[1]<br>
Disadvantages of this process are the toxicity and the risk associated with<br>
handling the starting compound hydrogen fluoride, and the highly exothermic<br>
evolution of heat in the reaction.<br><br>
Hexafluorophosphoric acid is commercially available as a 65% by weight aqueous<br>
solution. The solution is unstable at higher concentrations. Pure hexafluorophosphoric <br>
acid can be prepared in liquid sulfur dioxide, but is unstable at room temperature <br>
(D.E.C. Colbridge, Phosphorus. An Outline of chemistry, Biochemistry and<br>
Technology (Second Edition) Elsevier Scientific Publishing Comp. Amsterdam-<br>
Oxford-New York, 1980). The poor stability of highly concentrated hexafluorophosphoric <br>
acid solutions limits the potential uses of this acid as a catalyst. In addition, <br>
the coordination of the proton with the phosphorus hexafluoride anion reduces<br>
the proton activity of this acid.<br>
The present invention therefore has the object of providing fluorophosphoric acid<br>
compounds which do not have the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
This object is achieved by an acid of the general formula [I]<br>
where <br>
y= 1,2 or 3,<br>
and in which<br>
the ligands R may be identical or different, and<br>
R is a perfluorinated C1-8-alkyl or aryl group or R is a partially fluorinated C1-8-<br>
alkyl or aryl group in which some of the F or H may have been substituted by<br>
chlorine.<br>
The perfluorinated and the partially fluorinated alkyl or aryl groups R may be in the<br>
form of chain or ring structures.<br><br>
Preference is given to acids in which at least one group R is a perfluorinated n-, iso-<br>
or tert-butyl group or a pentafluorophenyl group and is particularly preferably a<br>
pentafluoroethyl group.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to acids in which y = 2 or 3. Particular preference is<br>
given to acids in which y = 3.<br>
Particular preference is given to the acids according to the invention trifluorotris-<br>
(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoric acid, trifluorotris(nonafiuoro-n-butyl)phosphoric acid,<br>
trifluorotris(heptafluoro-n-propyl)phosphoric acid, tetrafluorobis(nonafluoro-n-butyl)-<br>
phosphoric acid, pentafluoro(nonafluoro-n-butyl)phosphoric acid and tetrafluorobis-<br>
(heptafluoro-i-propyl)phosphoric acid.<br>
For the nomenclature of fluorinated phosphoric acids, reference is made to the<br>
IUPAC nomenclature (A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds.<br>
Recommendations, by R. Panico, W.H. Powell and Jean-Claude Richer, Blackwell<br>
Science, 1993).<br>
The acids according to the invention have the advantage over the fluorophosphoric<br>
acids known hitherto of being easy to prepare, having high proton activity and being<br>
stable at room temperature in highly concentrated solution.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of the<br>
acids according to the invention in which a perfluoroalkylphosphorane is reacted with<br>
hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a suitable solvent and/or proton acceptor.<br>
The preparation of perfluoroalkylphosphoranes as starting compounds for the process <br>
according to the invention is familiar to the person skilled in the art from the<br>
prior art, for example from German Patent Application DE 19 846 636 A1, which is<br>
incorporated herein by way of reference and is thus regarded as part of the disclosure.<br><br>
Suitable solvents and/or proton acceptors for the processes according to the invention <br>
are preferably compounds having one, two or more of the following atoms: O, N,<br>
S, P, Se, Te and As.<br>
Preference is given to water, alcohols, ethers, sulfides, amines, phosphines, carbox-<br>
ylic acids, esters, glycols, polyglycols, polyamines, polysulfides or mixtures of at least<br>
two of these solvents and/or proton acceptors.<br>
Particularly preferred solvents and/or proton acceptors are water, methanol, ethanol,<br>
acetic acid, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, dimethyl carbonate, dimethyl sulfide,<br>
dimethylformamide, triethylamine or triphenylphosphine, or mixtures of at least 2 of<br>
these compounds.<br>
The concentration of hydrogen fluoride in the suitable solvent is preferably greater<br>
than 0.1% by weight of HF, particularly preferably greater than 5% by weight of HF<br>
and very particularly preferably greater than 10% by weight and most preferably<br>
greater than 20% by weight, but less than 100% by weight, of HF.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reaction of the perfluoroalkylphosphorane in the<br>
processes according to the invention is carried out at a temperature of from -50 to<br>
+100°C, preferably at a temperature of from -35 to +50°C, particularly preferably at<br>
from 0 to 25°C.<br>
By means of the process according to the invention, acids of the general formula [I]<br>
are readily accessible in high yields.<br>
The present invention also relates to solutions of the acids according to the invention<br>
which have a concentration of greater than 2% by weight, preferably greater than<br>
20% by weight, particularly preferably greater than 70% by weight, most preferably<br>
greater than 80% by weight, of the acid in a suitable solvent.<br>
The solutions according to the invention, in particular in the high concentration<br>
ranges, enable proton activities which can only be achieved with difficulty with solutions <br>
of other fluorophosphoric acids. This is particularly advantaqeous on use of the<br><br>
acids according to the invention in highly concentrated form, for example as catalyst<br>
in a reaction mixture. A highly concentrated solution also avoids undesired dilution of<br>
reaction mixtures.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to salts of the general formula [II]<br><br>
where<br>
Mm+ is a monovalent, divalent or trivalent cation,<br>
m = 1, 2 or 3<br>
and y = 1, 2 or 3,<br>
and in which<br>
the ligands R may be identical or different, and<br>
R is a perfluorinated C1-8-alkyl or aryl group or R is a partially fluorinated C1-8-<br>
alkyl or aryl group in which some of the F or H may have been substituted by<br>
chlorine.<br>
The cation Mm+ can be a metal cation or an organic cation.<br>
Suitable organic cations are known to the person skilled in the art and are described,<br>
for example, in German Patent Application DE 10109032.3 on pages 4 to 6. This literature <br>
is incorporated herein by way of reference and is thus regarded as part of the<br>
disclosure.<br>
The salts of the general formula [II] preferably contain an Li, Zn, Mg, Cu, Ag, ammonium, <br>
phosphonium, oxonioum, sulfonium, arsonium, tropilium, a a nitryl cation, a<br>
nitrosyl cation or a tris(dialkylammino)carbonium cation.<br>
An advantage of the salts according to the invention is their good solubility in organic<br>
solvents.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, these salts are prepared by a process in which an acid<br>
according to the invention is reacted in a suitable solvent with a salt of the general<br>
formula [III]<br><br>
where<br>
Mm+ is a monovalent, divalent or trivalent cation,<br>
A is a basic or neutral anion or a mixture of basic anions or a mixture of at<br>
least one basic and at least one neutral anion,<br>
and m = 1, 2 or 3,<br>
or with metals, metal hydrides, metal oxides or metal hydroxides.<br>
The process is preferably carried out using salts of the formula [III] which contain at<br>
least one carbonate, chloride, fluoride, formate, acetate or trifluoroacetate anion.<br>
The process is preferably carried out using anions which form readily volatile acids,<br>
such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, formic acid or acetic acid.<br>
In the process, the metals employed are preferably Li, Na, K, Rb, Mg, Cs, Ca, Sr, Ba,<br>
Sc, Y, Yb, La, Al, In, Cd and/or Zn, the oxides employed are preferably Li2O, Na2O,<br>
K2O, MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO, Sc2O3, Y2O3, Yb2O3, La2O3, AI2O3, CdO, ZnO, CuO, FeO<br>
and/or Fe2O3, the hydroxides employed are preferably LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH,<br>
CsOH, Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, Cd(OH)2, Zn(OH)2, Sc(OH)3, AI(OH)3<br>
and/or Cu(OH)2, and the hydrides employed are preferably LiH, NaH, CaH2, YH3<br>
and/or AIH3.<br>
The process for the preparation of the salts according to the invention is simple to<br>
carry out and offers high yields.<br><br>
In addition, the present invention relates to the use of one of the salts according to<br>
the invention as catalyst, as phase-transfer catalyst, as solvent, in particular as ionic<br>
liquid, or as conductive salt in the electrolytes of various electrochemical devices.<br>
The person skilled in the art understands an "ionic liquid" to be organic compounds<br>
having an ionic structure and a low melting point, for example N,N-dialkylimidazolium<br>
salts [C.E. Song, E.J. Roh, Chem. Comm. (Camebridge) 2000, 10, pp. 837-838;<br>
J. Howarth, Tetrahedron Lett. 41 (2000) 34, pp. 6627-6629; C.E. Song, C.E. Oh,<br>
E.J. Roh, D.J. Choo, Chem. Comm. (Camebridge) 2000, 18, pp. 1743-1744).<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of an acid according to the invention as<br>
catalyst in the preparation of organic compounds.<br>
The acids according to the invention are particularly suitable as replacement for the<br>
acids HPF6 and/or HBF4 in chemical reactions.<br>
The acids and/or salts according to the invention are preferably used in one of the<br>

The invention is explained below with reference to examples. These examples serve<br>
merely to explain the invention and do not restrict the general inventive idea.<br>
The process according to the invention can be used to prepare, for example, trifluoro-<br>
tris(perfluoroalkyl)phosphoric acids in virtually quantitative yield by reaction of<br>
difluorotris(perfluoroalkyl)phosphoranes with hydrogen fluoride in suitable solvents.<br>
Surprisingly, this yield is virtually unimpaired by hydrolysis.<br>
The process according to the invention can be used, for example, to prepare a highly<br>
concentrated aqueous solution of trifluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoric acid within<br>
a few minutes by reaction of difluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphorane with 18.3% by<br>
weight aqueous HF. The reaction proceeds in accordance with the reaction equation<br>
[2]:<br>
(C2F5)3PF2 + HF + 5 H2O -&gt; [(C2F5)3PF3]H+ 5 H2O<br><br>
The resultant solution has a concentration of 83.2% by weight and is stable for a<br>
number of weeks at room temperature.<br>
Acid concentrations of less than 83.2% by weight can also be prepared in this way,<br>
for example by dilution with a suitable solvent or by reaction of a phosphorane with<br>
more highly diluted hydrogen fluoride solution.<br>
However, the reaction of phosphoranes with more-dilute aqueous hydrogen fluoride<br>
solutions, for example 2% by weight, take more time. In the case of more highly<br>
diluted aqueous hydrogen fluoride solutions, firstly an adduct of water and phosphorane <br>
is formed, and this is then slowly converted into the more stable product.<br>
The rate of conversion of the adduct into the product is temperature-dependent. At<br>
room temperature, the conversion in accordance with reaction [2] in 2% by weight<br>
hydrogen fluoride solution takes 2 days. At -21 °C and under the same concentration<br>
ratios, only 30% of the adduct has converted into trifluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phos-<br>
phoric acid within six days.<br>
On reaction of the phosphorane in an ice bath in accordance with reaction equation<br>
[2] with a 4.3% by weight aqueous hydrogen fluoride solution, a mixture of phos-<br>
phorane/water adduct and trifluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoric acid in the ratio<br>
1:2 is formed within 2-3 minutes.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or superatmospheric pressure, <br>
if desired also under a protective-gas atmosphere.<br>
Trifluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoric acid can exist in two different conformations,<br>
the meridional conformation and the facial conformation. The two structures exist in<br>
equilibrium. This equilibrium is dependent on the temperature and the hydrogen fluoride <br>
concentration in water during reaction of the starting materials. Initially, the<br>
meridional structure is formed, which then achieves an equilibrium with the facial<br>
structure.<br>
The person skilled in the art understands that the proton in the strong acids according <br>
to the invention is in the form of a complex with the respective solvent. In the for-<br><br>
mulation of the formulae in the examples, the complex of proton and solvent has<br>
therefore not been formulated out.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all applications, patents and publications mentioned <br>
above and below and of the corresponding application DE 101 30 940.6, filed<br>
on 27.06.2001, is incorporated into this application by way of reference.<br>
Even without further comments, it is assumed that a person skilled in the art will be<br>
able to utilise the above description in the broadest scope. The preferred embodiments <br>
and examples should therefore merely be regarded as descriptive disclosure<br>
which is absolutely not limiting in any way.<br>
All NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker WP 80 SY spectrometer (1H: 80 MHz,<br>
19F: 75.47 MHz).<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
3.74 g of water were added to 3.14 g of a 40% by weight aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
(62.8 mmol of HF) (in total 312.1 mmol of water) in an FEP (fluoroethylene polymer)<br>
flask. After this mixture had been cooled in an ice bath, 26.55 g (62.3 mmol) of<br>
difluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphorane were added over the course of 2 minutes<br>
while stirring using a magnetic stirrer. All the phosphorane had dissolved within 3<br>
minutes, and a colourless, clear solution of aqueous acid [(C2F5)3PF3] - H + had<br>
formed. 33.4 g of an 83.2% by weight trifluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoric acid<br>
solution were prepared in virtually quantitative yield.<br>
The compound conforms to the formula: [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+ -5H2O.<br>
The solution was analysed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were measured<br>
using an FEP tube with an acetone-D6 film as external lock and CCl3F as external<br>
reference.<br>
19F NMR, 5, ppm: -44.03 dm (PF); -80.61 m (CF3); -82.47 m (2CF3); -88.99 dm (PF2);<br>
-115.36 dm (3CF2); J1P.F=889 HZ; J1P.F=907 HZ; J2P.F=92 HZ.<br>
These signals belong to the meridional structure of the acid [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+-5H2O.<br>
Within 2 days, a new doublet formed in the 19F NMR spectrum at -67.41 ppm;<br>
J1P,F=786 Hz (PF3 group), which can be assigned to the facial structure of the acid<br>
E(C2F5)3PF3]-H+ -5H2O. No further changes were observed during storage at room<br>
temperature over the next 3 weeks. The 83.2% by weight acid formed an equilibrium<br>
mixture of about 90% of the meridional conformation and 10% of the facial conforma-<br>
tion of the acid at room temperature.<br>
Example 2<br>
2.24 g of water were added to 1.88 g of a 40% by weight aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
solution (37.6 mmol of HF) (in total 186.8 mmol of water) in an FEP flask. 15.88 g<br>
(37.3 mmol) of difluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphorane were added to the aqueous<br><br>
HF solution at room temperature over the course of 3 minutes while stirring the reaction <br>
mixture using a magnetic stirrer. Due to the exothermic reaction, temperatures of<br>
up to 50°C were reached, while the phosphorane dissolved. 20.0 g of a colourless,<br>
clear solution of [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+ in water with a concentration of 83.2% by weight<br>
were formed in virtually quantitative yield.<br>
The solution was analysed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were measured<br>
using an FEP tube with an acetone-D6 film as external lock and CCl3F as external<br>
reference.<br>
19F NMR (meridional conformation), 8, ppm: -44.46 dm (PF); -81.05 m (CF3); -82.85<br>
m (2CF3); -89.54 dm (PF2); -115.74 dm (3CF2); J1P.F= 889 Hz; J1P.F= 905 Hz;<br>
J2P.F=93 Hz.<br>
19F NMR (facial conformation), d, ppm: -67.82 dm (PF3); J1P.F= 784 Hz. Other signals<br>
of the facial conformation overlapped with the signals of the meridional conformation.<br>
The spectra show that in this case both conformations of the acid, both the meridional <br>
and the facial conformation, are formed at the time of preparation of the solution.<br>
Example 3<br>
10.57 g of water were added to 3.91 g of a 40% by weight aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
solution (78.2 mmol of HF) (in total 716.8 mmol of water) in an FEP flask. After this<br>
mixture had been cooled in an ice bath, 33.34 g (78.2 mmol) of difluorotris(penta-<br>
fluoroethyl)phosphorane were added over the course of 3 minutes while stirring using<br>
a magnetic stirrer. All the phosphorane dissolved within this time, and a clear solution<br>
of [(C2F5)3PF3]- H+ was formed. 47.8 g of aqueous trifluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)-<br>
phosphoric acid (I) in a concentration of 73.0% by weight were obtained in quantitative <br>
yield.<br>
19F NMR (CCbF - external reference): -44.45 dm (PF); -80.84 m (CF3); -82.57 m<br>
(2CF3); -89.13 dm (PF2); -115.75 dm (3CF2); J1P,F=889 HZ; J1P,F= 909 Hz; J2P,F=<br>
92 Hz.<br><br>
The signals shown belong to the meridional structure of the acid [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+ and<br>
exhibited no changes in the spectrum within 5 days. The acid [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+ thus<br>
preferentially exhibits the meridional conformation in the present concentration at<br>
room temperature.<br>
Example 4<br>
12.46 g of water were added to 1.51 g of a 40% by weight aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
solution (30.2 mmol of HF) (in total 741.7 mmol of water) in an FEP flask. After this<br>
mixture had been cooled in an ice bath, 12.74 g (29.9 mmol) of difluorotris(penta-<br>
fluoroethyl)phosphorane were added over the course of 3 minutes while stirring using<br>
a magnetic stirrer. All the phosphorane dissolved in this period, and 26.7 g of a<br>
colourless, clear solution of the acid were obtained in virtually quantitative yield.<br>
The 19F NMR spectrum showed the presence of two forms of hexacoordinated phosphorus. <br>
The first form is a complex of difluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphorane with<br>
water:<br>
19F NMR (CCl3F - external reference): -80.39 m (CF3); -81.31m (2CF3); -89.19 dm<br>
(PF2); -113.78 dm (3CF2); -164.59 s (H3O+HF) J1P.F = 846 Hz ; J2P.F =89 Hz.<br>
The second form is the usual meridional conformation of trifluorotris(pentafluoro-<br>
ethyl)phosphoric acid [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+.<br>
19F NMR (CCl3F - external reference): -44.60 dm (PF); -80.81 m (CF3); -82.49 m<br>
(2CF3); -89.34 dm (PF2); -115.96 dm (3CF2); J1P.F = 889 Hz ; J1P.F = 884 HZ; J2P.F =<br>
95 Hz.<br>
Within 4 days of storage at room temperature, the 19F NMR spectrum only showed<br>
the presence of the meridional conformation of trifluorotris(pentaftuoroethyl)phos-<br>
phoric acid [(C2F5)3PF3]- H+ in solution.<br>
Example 5<br><br>
29.60 g of water were added to 1.47 g of a 40% by weight aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
solufon (29.4 mmol of HF) (in total 1691.6 mmol of water) in an FEP flask. After this<br>
mixture had been cooled in an ice bath, 12.47 g (29.3 mmol) of difluorotris(penta-<br>
fluoroethyl)phosphorane were added over the course of three minutes while stirring<br>
using a magnetic stirrer. All the phosphorane dissolved within this period, and a<br>
colourless, clear solution of 43.5 g was prepared.<br>
The 19F NMR spectrum showed that in this case principally the aqueous adduct is<br>
formed directly on addition of the phosphorane.<br>
19F NMR (CCl3F - external reference): -79.49 m (CF3); -80.74 m (2 CF3);<br>
-88.60 dm (PF2); -113.35 dm (3CF2); -162.54 s (H3O+ HF) J1PfF=842 HZ;<br>
-J2P, F=89 Hz.<br>
Within five days at room temperature, this adduct was converted completely into<br>
tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphoric acid [(C2F5)3PF3] -H1". This was confirmed by<br>
19F NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Example 6<br>
5.64 g (122.3 mmol) of dimethyl ether were cooled to -35°C in an FEP flask using an<br>
ethanol bath. In succession, firstly 1.42 g (71.0 mmol) of hydrogen fluoride (HF) were<br>
slowly added to the reaction mixture and subsequently 30.25 g (71.0 mmol) of<br>
cHfluorotris(pentaftuoroethyl)phosphorane were added over the course of five minutes<br>
while the reaction mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer. When the phosphorane <br>
had dissolved and the reaction mixture had warmed to room temperature,<br>
37.3 g of a colourless, clear solution were obtained.<br>
This solution was analysed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were measured<br>
using an FEP tube with an acetonitrile-D3 film as external lock and CCl3F as internal<br>
reference.<br>
The 19F NMR spectrum showed that in this case the acid [(C2F5)3PF3]-H+ is preferentially <br>
formed with the meridional structure.<br><br>

Within three days, the concentration of the facial conformation of the acid<br>
[(C2F5)3PF3]~ H+ in the mixture increased.<br>
19F NMR spectrum of the facial conformation: -66.12 dm; J1P.F=798 HZ (PF3 group).<br>
Other signals of the facial conformation overlapped with the signals of the meridional<br>
conformation.<br>
No further changes in the 19F NMR spectra were observed within five weeks during<br>
storage at room temperature.<br>

fluoride (HF) was slowly added to the diethyl ether and then 18.67 g (43.8 mmol) of<br>
difluorotris(pentafluoroethyl)phosphorane were added over the course of 5 minutes.<br>
After dissolution of the phosphorane within one to two minutes and warming of the<br>
reaction mixture to room temperature, 25.6 g of a colourless, clear solution were<br>
formed.<br>
This solution was analysed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were measured<br>
using an FEP tube with an acetonitrile-D3 film as external lock and CCl3F as internal<br>

This solution was analysed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were measured<br>
using an FEP tube with an acetonitrile-D3 film as external lock and CCl3F as internal<br>

Example 19<br>
The starting material, difluorotris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphorane, was prepared as<br>
follows: 0.711 g (1.34 mmol) of tris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphine in 5 cm3 of dry toluene <br>
was mixed with 0.300 g (1.77 mmol) of xenon difluoride. The gas was liberated<br>
by heating the reaction mixture to from 50 to 60°C. The reaction was complete within<br>
20 minutes. After the solvent had been evaporated under reduced pressure, 0.750 g<br>
of a white, solid substance was isolated. The yield of the difluorotris(pentafluoro-<br>
phenyl)phosphorane was 98.5 mol%. The 19F NMR spectrum of the compound<br>
agrees with the spectra known from the literature (M. Fild and R. Schmutzler, J.<br>
Chem. Soc. (A), 1969, pp. 840-843).<br>
0.50 g of dried diethyl ether and 0.107 g (0.187 mmol) of difluorotris(pentafluoro-<br>
phenyl)phosphorane in an FEP flask were cooled by means of an ice bath. Firstly<br>
0.050 g (2.5 mmol) of hydrogen fluoride, HF, and then, overthe course of two<br>
minutes, 0.3 g of triethylamine were added while the reaction mixture was stirred<br>
using the magnetic stirrer. During the addition, all the phosphorane dissolved, and<br>
triethylammonium hydrofluoride precipitated. After the sediment had been separated<br><br>
off and the solvent had been evaporated under reduced pressure, 0.13 g of a viscous<br>
substance was isolated. Small amounts of this material were dissolved in acetone-D6,<br>
and this solution was analysed by 19F and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The spectrum confirmed <br>
the formation of trifluorotris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphoric acid, [(C6F5)3PF3]-<br>
H+, as a complex with triethylamine.<br>

6.36 g (70.6 mmol) of dry dimethyl carbonate, (CH3O)2CO, in an FEP flask were<br>
cooled using an ice bath. Firstly 10.99 g (25.8 mmol) of difluorotris(pentafluoro-<br>
ethyl)phosphorane were slowly added to the dimethyl carbonate and then 0.615 g<br>
(30.7 mmol) of hydrogen fluoride (HF) was added to the reaction mixture over the<br>
course of 5 minutes while stirring using a magnetic stirrer. After the phosphorane had<br>
dissolved and the reaction mixture had been warmed to room temperature, 17.8 g of<br>
a colourless, clear solution were obtained.<br>
The solution was analysed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were recorded<br>
using an FEP sample tube inside a 5 mm NMR tube with an acetone-D6 film as<br>
