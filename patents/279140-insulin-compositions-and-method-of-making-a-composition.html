				<td>INSULIN COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF MAKING A COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of acylated insulin with a prolonged action profile and high zinc content. Further the invention relates to a method for producing a composition with a prolonged action profile and high zinc content and a method for manufacturing a composition for the treatment of diabetes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently, the treatment of diabetes, both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, relies to an increasing extent on the so-called intensive insulin treatment. According to this regimen, the patients are treated with multiple daily insulin injections comprising one or two daily injections of a long acting insulin to cover the basal insulin requirement supplemented by bolus injections of a rapid acting insulin to cover the insulin requirement related to meals.<br>
Long acting insulin compositions are well known in the art. Thus, one main type of long acting insulin compositions comprises injectable aqueous suspensions of insulin crystals or amorphous insulin. In these compositions, the insulin compounds utilized typically are protamine insulin, zinc insulin or protamine zinc insulin.<br>
Certain drawbacks are associated with the use of insulin suspensions. Thus, in order to secure an accurate dosing, the insulin particles must be suspended homogeneously by gentle shaking before a defined volume of the suspension is withdrawn from a vial or expelled from a cartridge. Also, for the storage of insulin suspensions, the temperature must be kept within more narrow limits than for insulin solutions in order to avoid lump formation or coagulation.<br>
While it was earlier believed that protamines were non-immunogenic, it has now turned out that protamine insulin crystals can be immunogenic in man and that their use for medical purposes may lead to formation of antibodies. Also, evidence has been found that the protamine crystal is itself immunogenic. Therefore, with some patients the use of long acting insulin compositions containing protamines must be avoided.<br>
Another type of long acting insulin compositions are solutions having a pH value below physiological pH from which the insulin will precipitate because of the rise in the pH value when the solution is injected. A drawback with these solutions is that the particle size distribution of the precipitate formed in the tissue on injection, and thus the release profile of the medication, depends on the blood flow at the injection site and other parameters in a somewhat<br>
unpredictable manner. A further drawback is that the solid particles of the insulin may act as a local irritant causing inflammation of the tissue at the site of injection.<br>
Insulin is a 51 amino acid peptide hormone produced in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Its primary function, acting as a monomer, is to facilitate the transport of glucose molecules across the cell membranes of adipose and muscle tissue by binding to and activating a transmembrane receptor.<br>
A distinctive property of insulin is its ability to associate into hexamers, in which form the hormone is protected from chemical and physical degradation during biosynthesis and storage. X-ray crystallographic studies on insulin show that the hexamer consists of three dimers related by a 3-fold axis of rotation. These dimers are closely associated through the interaction of two zinc ions at its core positioned on the 3-fold axis.<br>
When human insulin is injected into the subcutis in the form of a high-concentration pharmaceutical formulation it is self associated, and here dissociation into monomers is relatively slow. Hexamers and dimers of insulin are slower to penetrate capillary wall than monomers.<br>
Zinc and phenolic additives are regularly used in therapeutic insulin preparations to promote hexamer formation as a precaution against degradation during storage. In this form, however, the action of injected insulin is delayed while the hexamers diffuse through the subcutis and dissociate into dimers and monomers.<br>
Formulations of insulin are usually prepared by dissolving insulin in a small volume of water under acidic conditions. Zinc is then added to the formulation followed by a neutralisation and addition of preservatives like phenol and m-cresol. The pharmaceutical formulation of these insulins are given as about 2, 3 or 4 zinc atoms per hexamer insulin.<br>
WO 2005/012347 discloses another group of acylated insulin derivatives comprising additional negatively charge compared to the acylated insulins disclosed in WO 95/07931. The pharmaceutical formulation of these acylated insulins are given as 2, 3 or 4 zinc atoms per hexamer insulin.<br>
WO 2003/094956 disclose stable insulin formulations prepared by mixing a monomeric insulin and a soluble acylated insulin analogue. The formulations contains from about 2.3 to about 4.5 Zn2+ per hexamer insulin. The acylated insulin analogue according to this invention is insulin detemir.<br>
From WO 2003/094951 it is known to formulate a stable soluble insulin formulation having both fast and long action. The formulation has a content of zinc in the range from about 2.3 to about 4.5 Zn2+ per hexamer insulin. The acylated insulin analogue according to this invention is insulin detemir.<br>
WO 99/21888 concerns aggregates of human insulin derivatives, which contains up to 5 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of insulin derivate.<br>
Human insulin has three primary amino groups: the N-terminal group of the A-chain and of the B-chain and the e-amino group of Lys629. Several insulin derivatives which are substituted in one or more of these groups are known in the prior art. Thus, US Patent No. 3,528,960 (Eli Lilly) relates to N-carboxyaroyl insulins in which one, two or three primary amino groups of the insulin molecule has a carboxyaroyl group.<br>
EP 894095 discloses insulin derivatives wherein the N-terminal group of the B-chain and/or the e-amino group of Lys in position B28, B29 or B30 has a substituent of the formula -CO-W-COOH where W can be a long chain hydrocarbon group. These insulin derivatives have a prolonged profile of action and are soluble at physiological pH values.<br>
WO 95/07931 discloses protracted insulin derivatives wherein a liphophilic side chain is attached either to the a-amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue of the B chain or to the e-amino group of a Lys residue present in the B chain of the parent insulin.<br>
The mechanism behind slow absorption of insulin detemir has been studied by Havelund et al. (The mechanism of protraction of insulin detemir, a long-acting acylated analog of human insulin., Pharmaceutical Research, 21(2004)1498-1504). Insulin formulations are prepared by adding 2 zinc atoms per hexamer insulin followed by glycerol, phenol, m-cresol and sodium phosphate.<br>
In Whittingham et al (Crystallographic and solution studies of N-Lithocholyl insulin: a new generation of prolonged-acting human insulin, Biochemistry 2004, 43, 5987-5995) a formulation of acylated insulin analogue is prepared. The insulin formulation is prepared by adding 2-2.5 zinc atoms per hexamer insulin followed by glycerol and phenol. The structures of the insulin is measured by size exclusion chromatography.<br>
The present invention is related to certain pharmaceutical compositions of acylated insulins which solves the problems of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a soluble pharmaceutical composition comprising an acyÂ¬lated insulin comprising more than 4 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of the acylated insulin.<br>
The zinc content may be up to about 12 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated inÂ¬sulin. The upper limit for the zinc content is the content of zinc which would cause precipitaÂ¬tion of the insulin and turning the solution into a suspension.<br>
In one aspect of the invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises between about 4.3 and about 12 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated insulin or between about 4.5 and about 12 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated insulin. In a further aspect of the invenÂ¬tion the pharmaceutical composition comprises between about 5 and about 11.4 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated insulin or between about 5.5 and about 10 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated insulin. In a further aspect the pharmaceutical composition comprises between about 6 and about 10.5 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated insulin or the pharÂ¬maceutical composition comprises between about 6.5 and about 10 zinc atoms per 6 moleÂ¬cules of acylated insulin or the pharmaceutical composition comprises between about 7 and about 9 zinc atoms per 6 molecules of acylated insulin. In a further aspect the pharmaceutiÂ¬cal composition comprises citrate from about one third to about 3 times the zinc concentraÂ¬tion.<br>
The insulin molecules of the present invention associate with each other to form complexes comprising zinc. These insulin-zinc complexes can be present in the pharmaceuÂ¬tical formulation as hexamers, dodecamers or complexes with a higher molecular weight than dodecamers. All kinds of insulin form complexes with zinc, eg. Human insulin, acylated insulin (insulin derivatives) and insulin analogues.<br>
In one aspect of the invention at least 85% of the acylated insulin is present as complexes which are acylated insulin dodecamers or complexes with a higher molecular weight than acylated insulin dodecamer.<br>
In one aspect of the invention at least 90, 92, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 99.5% of the acylated insulin is present as complexes which are acylated insulin dodecamers or complexes with a higher molecular weight than acylated insulin dodecamer.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a surfactant. The surfactant can be present in an amount of 0.0005-0.01% based on the weight of the pharmaceutical composition. In one aspect the surfactant can be present in an amount of 0.0005-0.007% based on the weight of the composition. An example of a surfactant could be polysorbate 20, which can be present in the composition in an amount of 0.001-0.003% based on the weight of the composition. Another example is poloxamer 188, which can be present in an amount of 0.002-0.006% based on the weight of the composition.<br>
The insulin molecule may be acylated at various positions in the insulin molecule. In one aspect the insulin is acylated in the e-amino group of a Lys residue in a position in the B-chain of the parent insulin molecule in particularly in the e-amino group of the B29 lysine group in the human insulin molecule. However, according to other aspects of the invention the acylation may take place in another position in the insulin molecule, e.g. the a-amino<br>
group in position B1 or in position where the natural amino acid residue in the insulin moleÂ¬cule has been substituted with a lysine residue provided that B29 is changed from a lysine to another amino acid residue.<br>
Thus in one aspect the acylated insulin is acylated either in the oamino group in the B1 position or in a free e-amino group of a lysine residue in the A- or B-chain of the insulin molecule.<br>
In one aspect the insulin is acylated in the free e-amino group of the lysine residue in position B29 of the insulin molecule.<br>
The acyl group will be a liphophilic group and will typically be a fatty acid moiety having from about 6 to about 32 carbon atoms comprising at least one free carboxylic acid group or a group which is negatively charged at neutral pH. The fatty acid moiety will more typically have from 6 to 24, from 8 to 20, from 12 to 20, from 12-16, from 10-16, from 10-20, from 14-18 or from 14-16 carbon atoms.<br>
In one aspect the pharmaceutical composition comprises at least one free carboxylic acid or a group which is negatively charged at neutral pH. In one aspect the pharmaceutical composition comprises an acyl group which is derived from a dicarboxylic fatty acid with from 4 to 32 carbon atoms.<br>
In a further aspect the fatty acid moiety is derived from a dicarboxylic fatty acid with from about 6 to about 32, from 6 to 24, from 8 to 20, from 12 to 20, from 12-16, from 10-16, from 10-20, from 14-18 or from14-16 carbon atoms.<br>
In one aspect the pharmaceutical composition comprises an acyl group which is atÂ¬tached to the insulin via a linker group through amide bonds.<br>
The acyl group may be attached directly to the free amino group in question. HowÂ¬ever, the acyl group may also be attached via amide bonds by a linker which links the free amino group in the insulin molecule and the acyl group in question together.<br>
The acylated insulin will typically have at least one, or two additional negative net charge compared to human insulin and more typically it will have two additional negative charges. The additional negative charge may be provided by the free carboxylic acid group in the fatty acid or by the linker group which may comprise one ore more amino acid residues of which at least one will contain a free carboxylic acid or a group which is negatively charged at neutral pH. In a further aspect the acyl group is derived from a dicarboxylic fatty acid.<br>
In one aspect the pharmaceutical composition comprises an insulin wherein the inÂ¬sulin has a side chain attached either to the a-amino group of the N-terminal amino acid resiÂ¬due of the B chain or to an e-amino group of a Lys residue present in the B chain of the parÂ¬ent insulin moiety via an amide bond, which side chain comprises at least one free carboxylic<br>
acid group or a group which is negatively charged at neutral pH, a fatty acid moiety with about 4 to about 32 carbon atoms in the carbon chain; and possible one or more linkers linking the individual components in the side chain together via amide bonds.<br>
In one aspect the insulin molecule has a side chain attached to the c-amino group of a Lys residue present in the B chain of the parent insulin, the side chain being of the general formula: -W-X-Y-Zz wherein W is:<br>
â¢	an a-amino acid residue having a carboxylic acid group in the side chain which residue<br>

â¢	a chain composed of two, three or four a-amino acid residues linked together via amide<br>

being selected from the group of amino acid residues having a neutral side chain and<br>
amino acid residues having a carboxylic acid group in the side chain so that W has at<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising recognition that an increase in the content of zinc above the usual level (between 2 and 4 zinc atoms per six molecules of acyÂ¬lated insulin) increases the proportion of medium and high molecular weight insulin comÂ¬plexes of certain acylated insulin derivatives, in particular the acylated insulin LysB29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin.<br>
According to the present invention it is possible to design the insulin formulation containing the insulin with desired degree of association.<br>
Furthermore, when mixing the acylated insulin with rapid acting insulin analogues a true biphasic action profile is obtained as no blunting occurs. Thus the invention provides soluble compositions that are mixtures of a rapid-acting insulin analogue and a prolonged-acting acylated insulin in which the rate of disappearance of the rapid acting insulin and the acylated insulin from the site of injection are the same as when injected in separate composiÂ¬tions. By administering insulin as a biphasic pharmaceutical composition, the number of inÂ¬jections can be reduced resulting in a more convenient and safe therapy.<br>
The present invention is further based on the surprisingly recognition that, when preparing an insulin formulation, zinc can be added to the formulation after addition of preÂ¬servatives. The zinc is typically provided by adding zinc acetate, zinc chloride or zinc citrate to the insulin formulation.<br>
According to the invention, an acylated insulin composition of this invention may be delivered by inhalation to achieve rapid absorption thereof. Administration by inhalation can result in pharmacokinetics comparable to subcutaneous administration of insulins. Inhalation of an acylated insulin composition of this invention leads to a rapid rise in the level of circulatÂ¬ing insulin followed by a rapid fall in blood glucose levels. Different inhalation devices typiÂ¬cally provide similar pharmacokinetics when similar particle sizes and similar levels of lung deposition are compared.<br>
According to the invention, an acylated insulin composition of this invention may be delivered by any of a variety of inhalation devices known in the art for administration of a therapeutic agent by inhalation. These devices include metered dose inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder generators, sprayers, and the like. Preferably, an acylated insulin composition of this invention is delivered by a dry powder inhaler or a sprayer. There are a several desirable features of an inhalation device for administering an acylated insulin composition of this inÂ¬vention. For example, delivery by the inhalation device is advantageously reliable, reproduciÂ¬ble, and accurate. The inhalation device should deliver small particles, for example, less than about 10 urn, for example about 1-5 urn, for good respirability. Some specific examples of commercially available inhalation devices suitable for the practice of this invention are Tur-bohalerâ¢ (Astra), RotahalerÂ® (Glaxo), DiskusÂ® (Glaxo), Spirosâ¢ inhaler (Dura), devices marÂ¬keted by Inhale Therapeutics, AERxâ¢ (Aradigm), the Ultravent* nebulizer (Mallinckrodt), the Acorn II* nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products), the VentolinÂ® metered dose inhaler (Glaxo), the SpinhalerÂ® powder inhaler (Fisons), the C-halerÂ© (Microdrug), the E-flexÂ© (Microdrug) or the like.<br>
As those skilled in the art will recognize, the formulation of an acylated insulin comÂ¬position of this invention, the quantity of the formulation delivered, and the duration of adÂ¬ministration of a single dose depend on the type of inhalation device employed. For some aerosol delivery systems, such as nebulizers, the frequency of administration and length of time for which the system is activated will depend mainly on the concentration of insulin conÂ¬jugate in the aerosol. For example, shorter periods of administration can be used at higher concentrations of insulin conjugate in the nebulizer solution. Devices such as metered dose inhalers can produce higher aerosol concentrations, and can be operated for shorter periods to deliver the desired amount of insulin conjugate. Devices such as powder inhalers deliver active agent until a given charge of agent is expelled from the device. In this type of inhaler, the amount of insulin derivative of this invention in a given quantity of the powder determines the dose delivered in a single administration.<br>
The particle size of insulin derivative of this invention in the formulation delivered by the inhalation device is critical with respect to the ability of insulin to make it into the lungs, and preferably into the lower airways or alveoli. Preferably, an acylated insulin composition of this invention is formulated so that at least about 10% of the insulin conjugate delivered is deposited in the lung, preferably about 10 to about 20%, or more. It is known that the maxiÂ¬mum efficiency of pulmonary deposition for mouth breathing humans is obtained with particle sizes of about 2 urn to about 3 urn. When particle sizes are above about 5 urn pulmonary deposition decreases substantially. Particle sizes below about 1 urn cause pulmonary depoÂ¬sition to decrease, and it becomes difficult to deliver particles with sufficient mass to be therapeutically effective. Thus, particles of an acylated insulin composition delivered by inhaÂ¬lation have a particle size preferably less than about 10 urn, more preferably in the range of about 1 urn to about 5 urn. The formulation of the insulin derivative is selected to yield the desired particle size in the chosen inhalation device.<br>
Advantageously for administration as a dry powder, an acylated insulin composition of this invention is prepared in a particulate form with a particle size of less than about 10 urn, preferably about 1 to about 5 urn. The preferred particle size is effective for delivery to the alveoli of the patient's lung. Preferably, the dry powder is largely composed of particles produced so that a majority of the particles have a size in the desired range. AdvantaÂ¬geously, at least about 50% of the dry powder is made of particles having a diameter less than about 10 urn. Such formulations can be achieved by spray drying, milling, or critical point condensation of a solution containing insulin conjugate and other desired ingredients. Other methods also suitable for generating particles useful in the current invention are known in the art.<br>
The particles are usually separated from a dry powder formulation in a container and then transported into the lung of a patient via a carrier air stream. Typically, in current dry powder inhalers, the force for breaking up the solid is provided solely by the patient's inhalaÂ¬tion. In another type of inhaler, air flow generated by the patient's inhalation activates an imÂ¬peller motor which deagglomerates the particles.<br>
Formulations of acylated insulin of this invention for administration from a dry powÂ¬der inhaler typically include a finely divided dry powder containing the acylated insulin, but the powder can also include a bulking agent, carrier, excipient, another additive, or the like. Additives can be included in a dry powder formulation of insulin conjugate, for example, to dilute the powder as required for delivery from the particular powder inhaler, to facilitate processing of the formulation, to provide advantageous powder properties to the formulation, to facilitate dispersion of the powder from the inhalation device, to stabilize the formulation<br>
(for example, antioxidants or buffers), to provide taste to the formulation, or the like. AdvanÂ¬tageously, the additive does not adversely affect the patient's airways. The an acylated insuÂ¬lin can be mixed with an additive at a molecular level or the solid formulation can include parÂ¬ticles of the insulin conjugate mixed with or coated on particles of the additive. Typical addiÂ¬tives include mono-, di-, and polysaccharides; sugar alcohols and other polyols, such as, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol, trehalose, sucrose, manni-tol, starch, or combinations thereof; surfactants, such as sorbitols, diphosphatidyl choline, or lecithin; or the like. Typically an additive, such as a bulking agent, is present in an amount effective for a purpose described above, often at about 50% to about 90% by weight of the formulation. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein such as insulin analogue protein can also be included in the formulation.<br>
A spray including the acylated insulin composition of this invention can be produced by forcing a suspension or solution of insulin conjugate through a nozzle under pressure. The nozzle size and configuration, the applied pressure, and the liquid feed rate can be chosen to achieve the desired output and particle size. An electrospray can be produced, for example, by an electric field in connection with a capillary or nozzle feed. Advantageously, particles of insulin conjugate delivered by a sprayer have a particle size less than about 10 urn, preferaÂ¬bly in the range of about 1 urn to about 5 urn.<br>
Formulations of acylated insulin of this invention suitable for use with a sprayer will typically include the insulin derivative in an aqueous solution at a concentration of about 1 mg to about 20 mg of insulin conjugate per ml of solution. The formulation can include agents such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, prefÂ¬erably, zinc. The formulation can also include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the inÂ¬sulin derivative, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating insulin conjugates include albumin, protamine, or the like. TypiÂ¬cal carbohydrates useful in formulating insulin conjugates include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The insulin derivative formulation can also include a surfacÂ¬tant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the insulin conjugate caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethyl-ene sorbitol fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between about 0.001 and about 4% by weight of the formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be administered parenterally to patients in need of such a treatment. Parenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection by means of a syringe,<br>
optionally a pen-like syringe or another convenient dosing equipment. Alternatively, parenteral administration can be performed by means of an infusion pump.<br>

hydroxyethyl)-1 -piperazineethanesulfonic	acid),	tris-hydroxymethyl-aminomethan,<br>
ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, and sodium phosphate.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can be used in the treatment of states which are sensitive to insulin. Thus, they can be used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia for example as sometimes seen in seriÂ¬ously injured persons and persons who have undergone major surgery. The optimal dose level for any patient will depend on a variety of factors including the efficacy of the specific acylated insulin or mixture of the acylated insulin with a rapid acting insulin employed, the age, body weight, physical activity, and diet of the patient, on a possible combination with other drugs, and on the severity of the state to be treated. It is recommended that the daily dosage of the insulin derivative of this invention be determined for each individual patient by those skilled in the art in a similar way as for known insulin compositions.<br>
The starting product for preparing the acylated insulin or insulin analogue contained in the composition according to the invention can be produced by either well-known peptide synÂ¬thesis or by well known recombinant production in suitable transformed microorganisms. Thus the insulin starting product can be produced by a method which comprises culturing a host cell containing a DMA sequence encoding the polypeptide and capable of expressing the polypep-tide in a suitable nutrient medium under conditions permitting the expression of the peptide, afÂ¬ter which the resulting peptide is recovered from the culture.<br>
The medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells, such as minimal or complex media containing appropriate supplements. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to pubÂ¬lished recipes (e.g. in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). The peptide proÂ¬duced by the cells may then be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating the proteinaceous components of the supernatant or filtrate by means of a salt, e.g. ammonium sulphate, purification by a variety of chromatographic procedures, e.g. ion exchange chromatog-raphy, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like, dependent on the type of peptide in question.<br>
The DMA sequence encoding the insulin polypeptide may suitably be of genomic or cDNA origin, for instance obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DMA sequences coding for all or part of the polypeptide by hybridisation using synthetic oli-gonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (see, for example, Sambrook, J, Fritsch, EF and Maniatis, T, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor LaboÂ¬ratory Press, New York, 1989). The DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide may also be preÂ¬pared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method deÂ¬scribed by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22 (1981), 1859 -1869, or the method described by Matthes et a/., EMBO Journal 3 (1984), 801 - 805. The DNA sequence may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described in US 4,683,202 or Saiki et a/., Science 239 (1988), 487 - 491.<br>
The DNA sequence may be inserted into any vector which may conveniently be subÂ¬jected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vecÂ¬tor, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is indeÂ¬pendent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the peptide is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA, such as a promoter. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the DNA encoding the peptide of the invention in a variety of host cells are well known in the art, cf. for instance Sambrook et a/., Molecular Cloning - a laboratory manual, second edition 1989.<br>
The DMA sequence encoding the peptide may also, if necessary, be operably conÂ¬nected to a suitable terminator, polyadenylation signals, transcriptional enhancer sequences, and translational enhancer sequences. The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DMA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell or one which confers resistance to a drug, e.g. ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracyclin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, hygromycin or methotrexate.<br>
To direct the insulin peptide into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA seÂ¬quence encoding the peptide in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide. The secretory signal seÂ¬quence may be that normally associated with the peptide or may be from a gene encoding anÂ¬other secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present peptide, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons skilled in the art (ct, for instance, Sambrook et a/.., supra).<br>
The host cell into which the DNA sequence or the recombinant vector is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present peptide and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells. Examples of suitable host cells well known and used in the art are, without limitation, E coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or mammalian BHK or CHO cell lines.<br>

Medium: 1.6 % glycerol, 16 mM phenol and 16 mM m-cresol, 7 mM trishydroxyÂ¬methylaminomethan, 10 mM NaCI, pH 7.5.<br>
Formulations of LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin 600 uM and Zn/6 acyl-ins varied at 3, 4, 6, and 8 were obtained by dilution of the above mentioned formulation B, D, F, and H with an equal amount of medium. The formulations were tested by size exclusion chromatography for the ability to form high molecular weight insulin on a Su-perose 6HR column eluted with 140 mM NaCI, 10 mM trishydroxymethylaminomethan pH 7.4, and 0.01 % NaN3 at 37 Â°C and 0.25 mL/min. Fractions were collected for every 4 minÂ¬utes starting at the high molecular weight exclusion limit and ending with the last of the monomer peak, in total 14 fractions. The fraction concentration of insulin analogue was quantified specifically by reverse phase chromatography and the concentration of zinc after addition of the chromophoric zinc chelator terpy at an pH 2.5 excursion (fig.3,4,5 and 6). The relative amount of LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin with a size larger than albumin (fraction [1-8]) was measured at 3, 4, 6, and 8 Zn/6 insulin to 67.4, 88.9, 98.0, and 97.9 % respectively. Furthermore the zinc concentration was following LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin especially in the high molecular size fractions.<br>

Mixing of an insulin analogue and an acylated insulin<br>
Formulations consisting of insulin 180 uM aspart and 420 uM LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desB30 human insulin and zinc concentration varied at 3, 6, and 8 Zn/6insulin were obtained by mixing the above stock solution A to H and the mentioned me-<br>
dium in an analogous manner. An example of calculating the concentration of zinc/6 acylated insulin is mixing 180 uM aspart with 3 Zn/6insulin and 420 uM LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin with 3 Zn/6acyl-ins makes 4.3 Zn/6 acylated insulin [(180*3+420*3)7420= 4.3 Zn/acyl-ins]. The formulations were tested by size exclusion chro-matography for the ability to form high molecular weight insulin on a Superose 6HR column, and fractions were similarly collected for quantification of both insulin analogues and zinc. As seen from figure 8 the analogues mixing with 3 Zn/6insulin corresponding to a formulation of 4.3 Zn/6 acyl-insulin showed predominantly LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin (72.5 % of LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desBSO human insulin) and zinc in the high molecular weight fractions [1-8], but also insulin aspart, whereas an equal amount of insulin aspart and LysB29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin was measured as mean in the rest of the fractions [9-14](fig.8). The testing of insulin aspart and LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin consisting of 6 Zn/6ins are shown in fig. 2 and fig.5 respectively. Mixing the two formulations of 6 Zn/6ins (fig 2. and fig.5) to aspart 180 uM + LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin 420 uM corresponding to 8.6 Zn/6acyl-ins showed a completely separated fraction of LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desBSO human insulin at the high molecular weight and insulin aspart at low molecular weight (fig. 10). Mixing at equal concentration of insulin aspart and LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin to 12 Zn/6acyl-ins showed separated fractions as well (fig.12). Further increased concentration of zinc to 8 Zn/6ins in the individual formulaÂ¬tions is shown in for LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin in fig 6 and the mix of aspart 180 uM + LysB29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO human insulin 420 uM in fig 11.<br>
As is clear from the figures, the increased amount of zinc surpricingly induced a separation of insulin aspart and LysB29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin in the pharmaceutical preparation, resulting in no significant blunting between the analogues.<br>
an increased amount of zinc induced a separation of insulin aspart and LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO human insulin in the pharmaceutical preparation in a way that the analogues showed actually no blunting.<br>

Isolation of LysB29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desB30 human insulin by crystalÂ¬lisation<br>
LysB29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desBSO human insulin can be crystallized as a hexamer with a zinc content of 2-6 mol zinc per 6 mol insulin and an excess of a phenol-like molecule (preferred phenol). As precipitants, ionic salts are used with NaCI being preferred.<br>
Furthermore crystallisation can be enhanced by adding small amounts of organic solvents (ethanol).<br>

Conclusion: SEC (Size Exclusion Chromatography) using isotonic saline eluent at body temperature is used as a model for insulin self association after injection in subcutis when phenolic preservatives have disappeared. Including phenol in the eluent SEC evaluÂ¬ates the state of insulin self association in the pharmaceutical formulation and briefly upon injection.<br>
B29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desB30 insulin 600 uM was formulated with zinc conÂ¬centrations increasing stepwise by one from 0 to 6 Zn/6ins, and the SEC method showed self association to very high molecular weight and more than human albumin for more than 90 %, when the zinc concentration was 5 Zn/6ins. Including phenol in the SEC eluent two sharp peaks were seen, at insulin dihexamer size and insulin monomer size, and at 4 Zn/6ins more than 95 % was at dihexamer size.<br>
All the formulations were mixed with insulin aspart (3 Zn/6ins) at equal concentration and volume and the content of the collected peaks were specifically analysed. At 4 Zn/6ins more than 95 % of B29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desBSO insulin was found at very high mo-<br>
lecular weight and more than 95 % of aspart was found at monomer size. Including phenol in the eluent two peaks were seen, at insulin dihexamer size and insulin monomer size, and at 4 Zn/6ins more than 95 % of the long acting insulin was at dihexamer size separated from more than 95 % of insulin aspart centered between monomer and hexamer size.<br>
No blunting of the equimolar formulation mix was seen when the long acting analog formulation contained less than 5 % of the monomeric form.<br>
Example 5.<br>
Miscibility of B29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desBSO insulin with Insulin Aspart: Euglycaemic Clamp Studies in Pigs<br>
Formulation<br>
B29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu desBSO insulin (ins.deriv.)(to 1200 uM ) was susÂ¬pended in water, dissolved and added glycerol 1.6%, and 16 mM phenol and 16 mM m-cresol. Before zinc addition pH was adjusted to 7.5 by sodium hydroxide, and zinc acetate added in smaller portions of max 1 Zn/6ins up to 3 Zn/6ins (ad I), to 5.62 Zn/6ins (ad II), and to 6 Zn/6ins (III). Sodium chloride was then added to 10 mM followed by adjustment of pH to 7.5 by sodium hydroxide, and adjustment of volume by water.<br>
Insulin aspart (to 600 uM) was suspended in water and added hydrochloric acid to about pH 2.5, zinc acetate to 3 Zn/6ins, glycerol to 1.6 %, 16 mM phenol and 16 mM m-cresol to sodium chloride to 10 mM, pH to 7.5 and water to final volume (IV).<br>
Finally insulin aspart (IV) was mixed to B29NÂ£-hexadecandioyl-v-Glu desBSO insulin in molar relation of 1:8 and total zinc concentration of 3.38 Zn/6ins.deriv.(l)(lowZnmix) and 6 Zn/6ins.deriv.(ll)(highZnmix).<br>
Animal experiment<br>
Female pigs (N=8, mean body weight 80 kg) were fasted 18 hours prior to the studÂ¬ies. To investigate the effect of mixing insulin aspart and B29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO insulin, each pig received sc in random order either a lowZnmix (I) or a highZnmix (II) or the two analogues (III and IV) administered separately in the same pig. The doses were 0.9 nmol/kg of insulin aspart and 7.2 nmol/kg of B29Ne-hexadecandioyl-y-Glu desBSO insulin. The pigs were kept euglycaemic at their individual fasting glucose levels by infusion of a 20% glucose solution. Dependent on changes in plasma glucose concentration adjustÂ¬ments of glucose infusion rate were made empirically. Blood samples were collected 0-24 h<br>
for specific ELISA plasma analysis of immunoreactive insulin, and the pharmacokinetic proÂ¬files are shown in fig. 13 and fig. 14.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The degree of blunting of both insulin components in the two mix preparations was examined. A marked blunting of both insulin aspart and insulin 454 was seen with low zinc concentration in the mix (3.38 Zn/ 6ins.deriv.). However, when the zinc concentration was increased to 6 zinc/6ins.deriv., no blunting of the pharmacokinetic profiles was observed. The glucose infusion rate compared well with the sum of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the individual insulin analogues.<br>
Example 6. Citrate as zinc buffer<br>
B29Ne-hexadecandioyl-Y-Glu des(B30) insulin (ins.deriv.)(to 600 uM ) was susÂ¬pended in water, dissolved and added glycerol 1.6%, phenol 16 mM, and m-cresol 16 mM. pH was adjusted to 7.5 by sodium hydroxide, and citrate was added in three formulations to 0.6,1.8 and 6 mM respectively in connection with zinc acetate to 6 zinc/6 insulin deriv.. SoÂ¬dium chloride was then added to 10 mM and sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) to 5 mM followed by adjustment of pH to 7.5 or 7.8 by sodium hydroxide, and adjustment of volume by water.<br>
The formulations were studied after storage 2 week at 37C compared to storage at 5C by the SEC method described in example 4 using an eluent with 2 mM phenol. Reference formulations without citrate at 3, 5 and 6 Zn/6ins.deriv. were included.<br>
Miscibility of Insulin Aspart (3Zn/6ins) and prolonged acting insulin derivative 30:70, as measured by collecting fractions from SEC and quantifying by HPLC the presence of fast-acting and prolonged-acting insulins in the high molecular weight fraction (peakl) and in the low molecular weight fraction (peak2). Fraction cut and quantitation is following example 4.<br>

Conclusion:<br>
Using a SEC isotonic saline eluent comprising 2 mM phenol the long acting insulin derivative is predominantly associated at a size of albumin corresponding to a dihexameric form (and not higher associated forms), and the amount of insulin derivative in the mono-meric form is decreased at zinc concentration increased from 3 to 5 and 6 Zn/6ins.deriv.. Adding 1, 3 or 10 citrate equivalents to the zinc concentration at 6 Zn/6ins.deriv. showed less content of the monomeric insulin derivative compared to a reference at 3 Zn/ins.deriv. The self associating pattern was not changed after storage 2 weeks at 37 Â°C.<br>
Miscibility of Insulin Aspart (3Zn/6ins) formulated without citrate and prolonged acting insulin derivative formulated as shown in the series above in this example - in the molar proÂ¬portion of 30:70 - is shown in the table after storage at 5 C and 2 weeks at 37 C. The insulin derivative formulations comprising citrate at three levels and 6 Zn/6ins were shown to be mixable with insulin aspart after 2 weeks storage at 37 C, whereas insulin aspart was partly included in the high molecular weight fraction at the normal level of zinc at 3 Zn/6ins.<br>

Assay (II)<br>
Potency of the insulin derivatives of the invention relative to human insulin<br>
Sprague Dawley male rats weighing 238-383 g on the experimental day were used for the clamp experiment. The rats had free access to feed under controlled ambient condiÂ¬tions and were fasted overnight (from 3 pm) prior to the clamp experiment.<br>
Experimental Protocol<br>
The rats were acclimatized in the animal facilities for at least 1 week prior to the surÂ¬gical procedure. Approximately 1 week prior to the clamp experiment Tygon catheters were inserted under halothane anaesthesia into the jugular vein (for infusion) and the carotid arÂ¬tery (for blood sampling) and exteriorised and fixed on the back of the neck. The rats were given Streptocilin vet. (Boehringer Ingelheim; 0.15 ml/rat, i.m.) post-surgically and placed in an animal care unit (25 Â°C) during the recovery period. In order to obtain analgesia, Anorphin (0.06 mg/rat, s.c.) was administered during anaesthesia and Rimadyl (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered after full recovery from the anaesthesia (2-3 h) and again once daily for 2 days.<br>
The clamp technique employed was adapted from (1). At 7 am on the experimental day overnight fasted (from 3 pm the previous day) rats were weighed and connected to the sampling syringes and infusion system (Harvard 22 Basic pumps, Harvard, and Perfectum Hypodermic glass syringe, Aldrich) and then placed into individual clamp cages where they rested for ca. 45 min before start of experiment. The rats were able to move freely on their usual bedding during the entire experiment and had free access to drinking water. After a 30 min basal period during which plasma glucose levels were measured at 10 min intervals, the insulin derivative to be tested and human insulin (one dose level per rat, n = 6-7 per dose level) were infused (i.v.) at a constant rate for 300 min. Plasma glucose levels were measÂ¬ured at 10 min intervals throughout and infusion of 20% aqueous glucose was adjusted ac-<br>
cordingly in order to maintain euglyceamia. Samples of re-suspended erythrocytes were pooled from each rat and returned in about 14 ml volumes via the carotid catheter.<br>
On each experimental day, samples of the solutions of the individual insulin derivaÂ¬tives to be tested and the human insulin solution were taken before and at the end of the clamp experiments and the concentrations of the peptides were confirmed by HPLC. Plasma concentrations of rat insulin and C-peptide as well as of the insulin derivative to be tested and human insulin were measured at relevant time points before and at the end of the studÂ¬ies. Rats were killed at the end of experiment using a pentobarbital overdose.<br>
Assay (III)<br>
Determination in pigs of T50% of the insulin derivatives of the invention<br>
TSO% is the time when 50% of an injected amount of the A14 Tyr[125l] labelled derivaÂ¬tive of an insulin to be tested has disappeared from the injection site as measured with an external y-counter.<br>
The principles of laboratory animal care were followed, Specific pathogen-free LYYD, non-diabetic female pigs, cross-breed of Danish Landrace, Yorkshire and Duroc, were used (Holmenlund, Haarloev, Denmark) for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. The pigs were conscious, 4-5 months of age and weighing 70-95 kg. The animals were fasted overnight for 18 h before the experiment.<br>
Formulated preparations of insulin derivatives labelled in Tyr*14 with 125I were inÂ¬jected sc. in pigs as previously described (Ribel, U., J0rgensen, K, Brange, J, and Henriksen, U.

At the beginning of the experiments a dose of 60 nmol of the insulin derivative acÂ¬cording to the invention (test compound) and a dose of 60 nmol of insulin detemir (both 125I labelled in Tyr A14) were injected at two separate sites in the neck of each pig.<br>
The disappearance of the radioactive label from the site of sc. injection was moniÂ¬tored using a modification of the traditional external gamma-counting method (Ribel, U. SubcuÂ¬taneous absorption of insulin analogues. Berger, M. and Gries, F. A. 70-77 (1993). Stuttgart; New York, Georg Thime Verlag (Conference Proceeding)). With this modified method it was possible to measure continuously the disappearance of radioactivity from a subcutaneous depot for sevÂ¬eral days using cordless portable device (Scancys Laboratorieteknik, Vaerlose, DK-3500,<br>
Denmark). The measurements were performed at 1-min intervals, and the counted values were corrected for background activity.<br>
