COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING SUGAR BUCT POCTIN AND CAROTI-NOIDS<br>
The present invention relates to novel compositions containing finely dispersed carotenoids and to a process for the preparation of such compositions. The novel compositions of this invention can be used as colorants or additives for food, beverages, animal feeds, cosmetics or drugs.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to novel compositions comprising sugar beet pectin and a carotenoid, to a process for preparing these compositions, their use as a colorant for food, beverages, animal feeds, cosmetics or drugs; and to food, beverages, animal feeds, cosmetics or drugs containing such compsitions.<br>
Pectins are basically cx,l—&gt;4 linked polygalacturonic acids which are partially esterified by methyl groups and which can by obtained from plants such as citrus fruit, apples and sugar beet. The term "sugar beet pectin" as used herein denotes pectins obtainable from sugar beet which are characterized and distinguished from citrus and apple pectins in that secondary hydroxy groups are partially acetylated, and by a lack of gelling properties. While such pectins might also be produced from pears and potatoes the commercially, readily available pectins of this type are made from sugar beet, e.g. as GENU Beta Pectin Type BETA from CP Kelco (Copenhagen Pectin A/S, DK-4623 Lille Skensved, Denmark). Thus, the term "sugar beet pectin" is intended to denote all pectins having substantially the properties of pectin obtained from sugar beet and comprises pectins obtained from other sources, e.g., pears and potatoes inasmuch as they have substantially the properties of pectins obtained from sugar beet. For the the purpose of the present invention, the sugar beet pectins preferably are those of which a 10 wt.-% aqueous solution has a viscosity of 20<br>
to 10000 mPa-s at 50 °C. The average molecular weight of such pectins is assumed to be in the range of 5 to 150 kDalton although this figure is not to be regarded as crucial in view of the well-known problematics of methodology in determinations of molecular weight.<br>
The term "carotenoid" as used herein comprises a carotene or structurally related polyene compound which can be used as a colorant for food, beverages, animal feeds, cosmetics or<br><br>
drugs. Examples of such carotenoids are a- or β-carotene, 8'-apo-β-carotenal, 8'-apo-β-carotenoic acid esters such as the ethyl ester, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin or crocetin, or mixtures thereof. The preferred carotenoid is 3-carotene.<br>
In the compositions of the present invention, the amount of sugar beet pectin is suitably from about 0.5 to about 60.0 wt.-% and the amount of carotenoid is suitably from about 0.1 to about 20.0 wt.-%.<br>
Suitably, the novel compositions of this invention further contain adjuvants and/or excipients such as one or more of a mono- di-, oligo- or polysaccharide, a triglyceride, a water-soluble antioxidant, a fat-soluble antioxidant, silicic acid and water.<br>
Examples of mono- and disaccharides which may be present in the compositions of the present invention are saccharose, invert sugar, glucose, fructose, lactose and maltose. Examples of oligo- or polysaccharides which may be present in the compositions of the present invention are starch and starch hydrolysates, such as dextrins and maltodextrins, especially such in the range of 5-65 dextrose equivalents (hereinafter: DE) and glucose syrup, especially such in the range of 20-95 DE. The term "dextrose equivalent" (DE) denotes the degree of hydrolysation and is measure for the amount of reducing sugar calculated as D-glucose based on dry weight. Native starch has DE close to 0 while glucose has a DE= 100.<br>
The triglyceride is suitably a vegetable oil or fat, such as corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, rape seed oil, arachis oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, cotton seed oil or cocos oil.<br>
The water-soluble antioxidant may be ascorbic acid and salts thereof, e.g., sodium ascorbate, and the like. The fat-soluble antioxidant may be a tocopherol, e.g., dl-a-<br>
tocopherol (i.e., synthetic tocopherol), d-a-tocopherol (i.e., natural tocopherol), β- and y-tocopherol and mixtures thereof; ascorbic acid esters of fatty acids such as ascorbyl palmitate or stearate; butyl hydroxy toluene; butyl hydroxy anisol; propyl gallate; or t-butyl hydroxy quinoline.<br>
The compositions of the present invention maybe an aqueous emulsion (i.e. an oil-in-water dispersion) or a powder.<br><br>
In one aspect the present invention relates to solid compositions, i.e. stable, water-soluble or dispersible powders. In another aspect, the present inventions relates to liquid compositions, i.e., aqueous colloidal solutions or oil-in-water dispersions of such powders.<br>
Typically, a powder composition according to the present invention comprises<br>
about 1 to about 60 wt.-% , preferably about 5 to about 30 wt.-% of sugar beet pectin;<br>
about 0.2 to about 20 wt.~% preferably about 0.5 to about 10 wt.-% of a carotenoid;<br>
0 to about 70 wt.-% preferably about 0 to about 40 wt.-% of a mono- or disaccharide;<br>
0 to about 50 wn.-% preferably about 0 to about 35 wt.-% of starch; 0 to about 70 wt.-% preferably about 0 to about 40 wt.-% of a starch hydrolysate; about 0.5 to about 50 wt.-% preferably about 1.5 to about 30 wt.-% of a triglyceride;<br>
0 to about 5 % preferably about 0.5 to about 2 wt.-% of a water-soluble antioxidant;<br>
0 to about 5 % preferably about 0.01 to about 2 wl.-% of a fat-soluble antioxidant;<br>
0 to about 2 wt.-% preferably about 1 wt.-% of silicic acid; and 0 to about 10 wt.-% preferably about 1 to about 5 wt.-% of water;<br>
the percentages of all ingredients totalling 100.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the novel carotenoid compositions can be prepared by processing the ingredients in a manner known per se for the preparation of water-soluble or dispersible carotenoid compositions. Thus, the compositions can be prepared by a process which comprises homogenizing an aqueous solution or colloidal solution of the pectin and optional water-soluble excipients and adjuvants, a solution or dispersion of the carotenoid and optional fat-soluble adjuvants in a triglyeride and, if required, converting the dispersion obtained into a powder.<br>
Typically, sugar beet pectin and optional water-soluble excipients and adjuvants are dissolved in water. The carotenoid and optional fat-soluble excipients and adjuvents are dissolved or suspended in triglyceride. The carotenoid solution (or dispersion) is then added to the aqueous pectin solution with stirring and the mixture is homogenized using<br><br>
conventional technology, e.g., by high-pressure homogenization, mixing devices as described in EP 100S380-A, high shear emulsification (rotor-stator systems), micronization or wet milling.<br>
The so-obtained oil-in-water dispersion can be converted into a solid composition, e.g. a dry powder using conventional technology such spray-drying, spray drying in combination with fluidized-bed granulation (the latter technique commonly known as fluidized spray drying or FSD), or by a powder-catch technique where sprayed emulsion droplets are caught in a bed of an absorbant such as starch and subsequently dried.<br>
The novel compositions of this invention can find use as colorants or vitamin A supplement for food, beverages, animal feeds, cosmetics or drugs. By the present invention<br>
there are preferably provided compositions comprising (3-carotene as a colouring agent.<br>
These compositions, when dissolved, dispersed or diluted in/with water to a final [}-carotene concentration of 10 ppm are typically characterized by ultraviolet/visible-spectroscopy using deionized water as reference. At a sample thickness of 1 cm the dispersions show an extinction of at least 0.3 (preferably above 1.0) absorbance units at the wavelength of maximum optical density in the range of 400 to 600 nm. This is equivalent<br>
to a formal extinction coefficient of (3-carotene in aqueous dispersion E(l%, 1cm) of 300 (preferably &gt;1000).<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention further.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
A dry premix of 80 g of beet pectin (GENU Pectin Type Beta of Copenhagen Pectin A/S; viscosity of a 10 % aqueous solution of the pectin at 50°C around 4000 mPa-s), 160 g of sucrose and 80 gof a maltodextrin (DE 20-23) was prepared. The dry premix was dissolved in 1200 ml ofdeionized water at6G°C and another 335 g of maltodextrin (DE20-23) were added. After complete dissolution of the solids 8.0 g of Na-ascorbate was added to the mixture (= solution A).<br>
136 g of a triglyceride (Durkex 500, partly hydrogenated soybean oil of Loders Croklaan B.V.; 1520 AA Wormerveer The Netherlands) and 0.9 g of dl-otocopherol were mixed and heated to 140°C. Subsequently, 11 g of p-carotene was suspended in the mixture of<br>
triglyceride and tocopherol. By stirring for about 10 minutes at 140°C a clear solution of j3-carotene was obtained (= solution B).<br>
Solution A was heated to 70°C and a crude emulsion was prepared by adding 135 g of solution B to solution A while gently stirring. A fine emulsion was obtained by a five passage high pressure homogenizing treatment of the preemulsion at a pressure of 50/300 bar (APV Lab Homogenizer Type Gaulin Lab 40-10 RBFI of APV Switzerland AG, CH-3076 Worb). The emulsion was diluted by adding an equal volume ofdeionized water at 60°C and then spray dried in a laboratory spray dryer (Mobile Minor of GEA Niro A/S, DK-2860 Soborg) at an inlet temperature of 200°C-210°C and an outlet temperature of 70-75°C. The spray-dried powder was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature over night.<br>
A fine powder was obtained with a water content of 2.2 %. The p-carotene content of the powder was 1.1 % as determined by spectrophotometry and HPLC-analysis. The powder was dispersed in deionized water and the extinction of the dispersion was measured in a 1 cm quartz precision cell against water. For a 10 ppm dispersion of P-carotene an extinction of 2.109 at a wavelength of 464 nm was calculated (E(l°/o&gt;lcm) =2109)<br><br><br>
A dry premix of 160 g of beet pectin (Copenhagen Pectin A/S; viscosity of a 10 % aqueous solution of the pectin at 50°C around 500 mPa-s), 160 g of sucrose and 335 g of a maltodextrin (DE 20-23) was prepared. The dry premix was dissolved in 1400 ml of -deionized water at 60°C. After complete dissolution of the solids 8.0 gof Na-ascorbate was added to the mixture (= solution A).<br>
136 g of a triglyceride (Durkex 500) and 0.9 g of dl-a-tocopherol were mixed and heated to<br>
140°C. Subsequently, 11 g of (3-carotene was suspended in the mixture of triglyceride and<br>
tocopherol. By stirring for about 10 minutes at 140°C a clear solution ofβ-carotene was obtained (= solution B).<br>
Solution A was heated to 70°C and a crude emulsion was prepared by adding 135 g of solution B to solution A while gently stirring. A fine emulsion was obtained by a three passage high pressure homogenizing treatment of the preemulsion at a pressure of 50/300 bar (APV Lab Homogenizer Type Gaulin Lab 40-10 RBFI). The emulsion was diluted by adding an equal volume of deionized water at 60°C and then spray dried in a laboratory spray drier (Mobile Minor of GEA Niro A/S) at an inlet temperature of 200°C-210°C and an outlet temperature of 70-75°C. The spray dried powder was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature over night.<br>
A fine powder was obtained with a water content of 2.5 %. The β-carotene content of the powder was 1.2 % as determined by spectrophotometry and HPLC-analysis. The powder was dispersed in deionized water and the extinction was measured in a 1 cm quartz<br>
precision cell against water. For a 10 ppm dispersion of β-carotene an extinction of 2.051 at a wavelength of 463 nm was calculated (E(l%,lcm)=2051).<br>
Example 3<br>
A dry premix of 28.6 g beet pectin (GENU Pectin Type Beta of Copenhagen Pectin A/S; viscosity of a 10 % aqueous solution of the pectin at 50°C around 4000 mPa-s) and 121.4 g sucrose was prepared. The dry premix was dissolved in 180 ml of deionized water at 50°C for 30 minutes under stirring (= solution A).<br><br>
A 30 % suspension of β-carotene in corn oil stabilized by dl-ct-tocopheroi (β-arotene 30 % FS of Roche Vitamins) was heated under stirring for about 30 minutes at a temperature of 160°C(= solution B).<br>
An emulsion was prepared by adding solution B to solution A. By vigorously stirring for 30 minutes at 50°C a fine emulsion was obtained. The emulsion was diluted by adding 200 ml of deionized water.<br>
300 g of the diluted emulsion were taken and, again, diluted with 50 ml of water. The final emulsion was sprayed into a cooled fluidized bed of corn starch. Excess corn starch was removed by sieving and a coarse powder was obtained. The powder was dried in an air stream at room temperature for about 2 hours.<br>
A powder was obtained with a water content of 6.4 %. The (3-carotene content of the powder was 2.5 % as determined by spectrophotometry! assay. The starch content of the powder was 54 %. The powder was dispersed in deionized water and the extinction was<br>
measured in a 1 cm quartz precision cell against water. For a 10 ppm dispersion of β-carotene an extinction of 0.401 at a wavelength of 530 nm was calculated (E(l%,lcm) =401).<br><br><br><br>
