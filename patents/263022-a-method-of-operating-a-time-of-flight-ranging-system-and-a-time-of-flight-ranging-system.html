DESCRIPTION<br>
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TIME-OF-FLIGHT RANGING<br>
SYSTEMS<br>
The present invention relates to improvements in or relating to time-of flight ranging systems and to applications using such systems. A particular, but not exclusive, application of the present invention is in keyless entry systems, for example passive keyless entry systems used in the automotive market and to a vehicle security system.<br>
For convenience of description, the present invention will be described with reference to vehicle entry systems.<br>
Philips Semiconductors in a document number 9397 750 10317,<br>
released	October	2002,	and	available	on<br>
http://www.semiconductors.phifips.com/acrobat/llterature/9397/75Q10317.pdf, discloses a vehicular passive keyless entry system. A block schematic diagram of this known passive keyless entry system Is shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. The system comprises a vehicle mounted first part 10 and a portable second part 12 which may be incorporated into a key fob, access card or other suitably small device. The vehicle mounted part 10 comprises a 125 kHz inductive transmitter 14 having a signal output coupled to an antenna 16 in the form of an inductive coil. The transmitter 14 is operative at least while the vehicle doors are locked. A microcontroller 18 is provided having an input coupled to an output of the inductive transmitter 14, an input/output 20 coupled to output locking/unlocking devices (not shown), such as door locks, boot (or trunk) locks, bonnet (or hood) locks and engine ignition security devices, and an output coupled to a UHF receiver 22. An antenna 24 is coupled to the receiver.<br>
The portable part 12, which constitutes an ID device, comprises a 125 kHz LF front end stage 26 having a three dimensional input consisting of three orthogonally related inductive coils 28. A microcontroller 30 has an input<br><br>
coupled to an output of the front end stage 26 and an output coupled to a UHF transmitter 32 having an antenna 34. The portable part 12 also includes connections for connecting to a battery 36, and on/off switch 38, a wake-up pattern detector 40 and a power management stage 42.<br>
The illustrated system allows drivers to enter their vehicles without any explicit action to unlock them as authorization is granted simply by carrying the appropriate portable part or ID device 12. As a driver comes within an operating area, say less than 2.5 metres, of the vehicle and places his/her hand on the door handle causing the inductive transmitter 14 to generate a challenge signal. The front end stage 26 receives the challenge signal which causes the portable part 12 to be woken-up. Once woken the microcontroller 30 analyses the challenge signal and once satisfied that it is directed to it, a response signal is compiled, encrypted if thought necessary, and passed to the UHF transmitter 32 for onward transmission to the UHF receiver 22.<br>
The microcontroller 18 in the vehicle mounted part 10 compares the signal received by the UHF receiver 22 with internally stored information and, if authentication is successful, unlocks the vehicle door. The entire process takes only a few milliseconds from start to finish<br>
As a refinement, once the driver has gained access to the inside of the vehicle, the authentication procedure may be repeated and if successful the engine can be started by simply pressing the start button.<br>
Finally after leaving the vehicle, it can be locked by simply pressing the door handle. Before locking a check is made to ensure that the portable part 12 is outside the vehicle.<br>
Since the introduction of such a system a flaw, termed "relay attack", has been discovered whereby two persons equipped with suitable radios capable of transmitting over distances greater than that achievable by the transmitter 32 in the portable part 12 can cheat the system into believing that the vehicle owner is gaining entry to his own vehicle. Figure 2 illustrates diagrammatically how such a relay attack may be effected. A first thief TF1 equipped with two radio transceivers 50, 56 positions himself/herself close to a vehicle 44 containing the vehicle part 10 and a second thief TF2 equipped with<br><br>
two radio transceivers 52, 54 positions himself/herself close to the vehicle's owner 46 who has the portable part 12 on their person. The first thief TF1 presses the door handle of the vehicle 44 causing the inductive transmitter 14 to generate a challenge signal having a frequency f. Signal frequency f is received by the transceiver 50 and is relayed as frequency f1 to the transceiver 52 carried by the second thief TF2. The signal is reconverted to the frequency f which is detected by the front end stage 26 in the portable part. The UHF transmitter 32 transmits a UHF signal having a frequency f which is picked-up by the transceiver 54 and is forwarded as frequency f2 to the transceiver 56, the latter transceiver converts the signal back to the UHF frequency f which is transmitted to the receiver 22 in the vehicle part 10 causing the microcontroller 18 to unlock the door. If necessary the operation is repeated to enable the vehicle's engine to be started. The owner of the vehicle 44 is unaware of what has happened until he/she returns to find their vehicle missing.<br>
One method which has been proposed to defeat relay attack is to make the system sensitive to an excessive time delay between the generation of, and reception of, signals between the vehicle part 10 and the portable part 12 and inhibit operation of the locks and any other security devices. The excessive time delay occurs due to the extended round trip time by way of the transceivers 50, 52, 54, and 56.<br>
Accurately calculating the time-of-fiight is computationally intensive because several variables such as accuracy of clock generators and clock offsets have to be taken into account. Correlating across large amounts of data is time consuming and having a receiver, such as the receiver 22, energised for relatively large amounts of time consumes battery current which is undesirable.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to operate a time-of-flight ranging system more effectively.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of operating a time-of-flight ranging system comprising first and second   stations   having   transmitting   and   receiving   means,   the   method<br><br>
comprising the first station measuring the time-of-flight of a signal between the first and second stations, calculating the time-of-flight using a relatively coarse algorithm when the second station is relatively far from the first station and calculating the time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively precise algorithm when the second station is relatively close to the first station.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there Is provided a time-of-flight ranging system comprising first and second stations, each of the first and second stations having transmitting and receiving means for communicating with each other, and control means, characterised by the first station further comprising time-of-flight measuring means for determining the distance between itself and the second station, the measuring means being adapted to calculate time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively coarse algorithm when the second station is relatively far from the first station and to calculate time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively precise algorithm when the second station is relatively close to the first station.<br>
The present invention is based on recognising that when a user is a relatively large distance, say greater than 5 metres, from a vehicle the calculation of the time-of-flight can be done using a relatively coarse algorithm consuming less current and time but when the user is closer to the vehicle the calculation of the time-of-flight needs to be done using a more precise algorithm which consumes more current and time.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the first and second stations are capable of producing low and high clock frequencies for use in respectively calculating the time-of-flight coarsely and with precision. As the UHF transmission frequency is unchanged different multiplier ratios are used to produce this frequency from the clock generators.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention one or both of the first and second stations has or have transmitting power management means for adjusting the transmitting power between at least a first, high level when the relatively coarse algorithm is being used to calculate time-of-flight and a second, low level when the relatively precise algorithm is being used to calculate time-of-flight.<br><br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a keyless access control system comprising first and second stations, each of the first and second stations having transmitting and receiving means for communicating with each other, and control means, characterised by the first station further comprising time-of-flight measuring means for determining the distance between itself and the second station, the measuring means being adapted to calculate time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively coarse algorithm when the second station is relatively far from the first station and to calculate time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively precise algorithm when the second station is relatively close to the first station.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided a vehicle security system comprising lockable security means responsive to locally generated signals and a keyless access control system comprising a fixed first part to be mounted in a vehicle and a portable second part to be carried by a vehicle user, both said parts having signal transmitting and receiving means for effecting communication with each other, and control means, characterised by the fixed first part further comprising time-of-flight measuring means for determining the distance between itself and the second station, the measuring means being adapted to calculate time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively coarse algorithm when the second station is relatively far from the first station and to calculate time-of-flight in accordance with a relatively precise algorithm when the second station is relatively close to the first station.<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a block schematic diagram of a passive keyless entry system,<br>
Figure 2 illustrates diagrammatically how a relay attack can be effected,<br>
Figure 3 is a block schematic diagram of a passive keyless access control system made in accordance with the present invention,<br><br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of the method in accordance with the present invention, and<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart illustrating a second embodiment of the method in accordance with the present invention.<br>
in the drawings the same reference numerals have been used to indicate corresponding features.<br>
Referring to Figure 3 the illustrated passive keyless access control system comprises a fixed part, which is mounted in a vehicle, and a portable part 12, which is carried by a user. For convenience of handling and storage, the portable part 12 may be implemented as a key fob or card.<br>
The fixed part 10 comprises a UHF transceiver 22 coupled to a signal propagation device, for example an antenna 24. A receiver section of the transceiver 22 is coupled by way of an ana!og-to-digita! converter (ADC) 60 to an input 61 of a processor 18 which operates in accordance with program software held in a program store 62. An output 63 of the processor 18 is coupled by way of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 64 to a transmitter section of the transceiver 22. A clock 66, controlled by the processor 18, has outputs 67, 68, 69 and 70 coupled respectively to the processor 18, the DAC 64, the ADC 60 and the transceiver 22. A time-of-flight measurement stage 72, which may be integrated with, or formed by, the processor, is coupled to the processor 18. A power management stage 74, controlled by the processor 18, has an output coupled to the transceiver 22.<br>
The portable part comprises a UHF transceiver 32 coupled to a signal propagation device, for example an antenna 34. A receiver section of the transceiver 32 is coupled by way of an anafog-to-digital converter (ADC) 76 to an input 77 of a microprocessor 30 which operates in accordance with program software held in a program store 78. An output 79 of the microprocessor 30 is coupled by way of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 80 to a transmitter section of the transceiver 32. A clock 82, controlled by the microprocessor 30, has outputs 83, 84, 85 and 86 coupled respectively to the processor 30, the DAC 80, the ADC 76 and the transceiver 32. A random<br><br>
access memory (RAM) 88 is coupled to the processor 30. A power management stage 90, controlled by the microprocessor 30, has an output coupled to the transceiver 32.<br>
One mode of operation of the passive keyless entry system will now be described with reference to the flow chart shown in Figure 4.<br>
It will be assumed that a user has locked his vehicle and moved out-of-range of the transceiver 22. Block 100 relates to the processor generating a ranging signal which is transmitted by the transceiver 22. The frequency or frequencies used by the transceiver will be that one or one of those permitted by the radio regulatory authorities, for example a 1MHz bandwidth signal in the frequency range 868 to 915 MHz or a 20MHz spread spectrum signal in the ISM band around 2.4GHz.<br>
When the portable part 12 is in range, its transceiver 32 receives the ranging signal and its processor 30 generates a response signal which is transmitted by its transceiver 32.<br>
Block 102 represents the fixed part receiving the response signal. Block 104 represents the processor 18 and the time-of-flight measurement stage 72 estimating the distance using a coarse algorithm, that is an algorithm which does not take into account clock offset, clock drift and timing information better than a single clock cycle thereby reducing the number and amount of register values that the processor 18 must maintain. The use of a coarse algorithm represents a power saving at the expense of accuracy at a time when it is not necessary to measure range precisely.<br>
In block 106 a check is made to determine if the estimated distance is less than a preset threshold value corresponding to say a distance of 10 metres (from the vehicle). If the answer is no (N), the flow chart reverts to the block 104. Alternatively, if the answer is yes (Y), the flow chart continues to block 108 in which the distance is estimated using an precision algorithm which takes into account factors such as clock offset, clock drift and timing information better than a single clock cycle. The increase in accuracy in measuring range is at the expense of increased power consumption.<br><br>
Block 110 relates to checking if the portable 12 is within the vehicle alarm disabling distance, say 1 metre. If the answer is no (N), the flow chart reverts to the block 108. If the answer is yes (Y) then block 112 represents the operations of disabling the vehicle alarm and unlocking at least the driver's door.<br>
The switch from the coarse algorithm to the predse one is a matter of choice by a manufacturer. Optionally the threshold may be set at the side of the vehicle and corresponds to the alarm disabling distance. Once in the vehicle the precise algorithm is used because for applications, such as "keyless-go" when the engine can be started by the operation of a switch mounted in the vehicle or, remotely, by actuation of a start switch on the portable part, it is crucial to verify the location of the portable part to an accuracy of less than 1 metre.<br>
in variants/refinements of the method illustrated by the flow chart shown in Figure 4, the clock speed in the fixed part can reduced when the portable part is beyond the threshold distance and increased when the portable part is closer and/or the power of the transmitter in the fixed part and, optionally, also the transmitter in the portable part, is changed from a high level, when beyond the threshold distance, to a low level, when within the threshold distance. The options are illustrated in the flow chart shown in Figure 5, which is an enhancement of the flow chart shown in Figure 4. Either one of these two refinements will enable power saving by both the fixed and portable parts when beyond the threshold distance.<br>
There is a presumption that the local oscillator and carrier frequencies of the transceivers 22 and 32 are generated by frequency synthesisers having selectable multiplier ratios to obtain the same output frequency from different clock frequencies. A drawback to this approach is that any error in the clock frequency is amplified by a high multiplication ratio leading to a degradation in the measurement accuracy. In another variant the stability of the clock oscillator may be varied by switching-in clock stability circuits.<br><br>
The switching of output powers of can be effected by way of the power management stages 74 and 90 (Figure 3) in accordance with control signals generated by the processor 18 and microprocessor 30, respectively.<br>
In order to enable the portable part 12 to switch clock frequencies and/or output powers substantially contemporaneously with the fixed part, appropriate control signals can be included in the ranging signals transmitted by the fixed part 10.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, the flow chart commences with block 114 relating to the clock frequency of at least the fixed part 10 being set to a lower frequency causing the processor 18 to operate more slowly and for the frequency synthesiser multiplication ratio to be increased to maintain the transmitter frequency. Similar changes may effected in the portable part 12.<br>
Block 100 relates to the fixed part 10 transmitting a ranging signal and block 102 relates to it receiving a response from the portable part 12. Block : 104 relates to the distance being estimated using a coarse algorithm. Block 106 relates to checking if the estimated distance is less than a threshold value. If it is not (N) the flow chart reverts to the block 114. Alternatively, if the distance is less then the threshold (Y), the flow chart continues to a block 116 which relates to setting the clock frequency in the fixed part 10 to a higher frequency. Simultaneously with this operation, in the next ranging signal transmitted the fixed part 10 sends an instruction for the clock 82 in the portable part 12 to switch to a high frequency, block 120. Additionally, in block 118 the power of the transmitter section of the transceiver 22 is reduced and an instruction is sent to the portable part 12 to reduce the power of its transmitter.<br>
In block 108 the distance is estimated using a precision algorithm. Block 110 relates to checking if the portable part 12 is within the alarm disabling distance. If the answer is no (N) the flow chart reverts to the block 108. However if the answer is yes (Y) the vehicle's alarm is disabled and at least one of the doors is unlocked.<br>
Although the use of a single threshold distance has been referred to in the illustrated embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that<br><br>
the time-of-flight measuring stage and/or the processor 18 may store additional threshold values at which actions may be taken, such as the flashing of vehicle lights to alert a driver to the location of the vehicle, changing the quality of the distance estimating algorithm, changing the clock frequency and changing the transmitter power.<br>
The method of measuring the time of flight is a known technique and assuming that the clocks 66 and 85 of the parts 10 and 12 are synchronised and that there are no internal time delays, the time of flight equals half the time between the transmission of a ranging signal and receiving a response. However because of the existence of internal group and digital delays this simple approach is not accurate. A method of calibrating a keyless entry system is disclosed in unpublished United Kingdom Patent Application 0404857.5 (Applicant's reference PHGB040054GBP). In summary the fixed and portable parts are positioned within a known distance of each other and the time of flight is measured. An error in the measured time-of-flight due to the propagation delays in the circuitry of the respective parts is determined by deriving the difference between the measured time-of-flight and a theoretical time-of-flight over a known distance and using the difference to adjust the measured time-of-flight.<br>
Other applications to which time-of-flight measurements may be used are tracking systems such as toddler alarms for use in ensuring that toddlers do not stray too far when out roaming, for example when shopping, and systems for tracking doctors, patients and equipment on large sites such as hospitals. In a parent/toddler or similar application the first part 10 would be carried by the parent and the second part 12 would be attached to the toddler. Calibration/recalibration could be effected by for example juxtaposing the first and second parts adjacent each other or spaced apart by a known distance or by introducing a known delay corresponding to a certain distance in the signal propagation path.<br>
In a non-illustrated variant of the system shown in Figure 3, a 125kHz inductive transmitter/receiver system of a type similar to that shown in Figure 1<br><br>
may be  provided  in  those applications where  it is desired  to generate challenge signals.<br>
In the present specification and claims the word "a" or "an" preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. Further, the word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of other elements or steps than those listed.<br>
