A HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE<br>
DR. SHAH RAJESH NAROTTAMDAS<br>
an Indian National<br>
of Lie Force Center, 415, Krushal Commercial Complex, Above Shopper's Stop,<br>
Chembur, Mumbai 400 089, Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
25-1-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to "Homeopathic medicine".<br>
The present invention relates generally to methods for the treatment of Immunological medicated disorders in extreme stage, i.e. when the condition of patient is very serious for such situation a micro dose of HIV-Type-II virus is given to the patient.<br>
The homneopathically Potentized (micro dose) HIV-Type I and HIV-TYPE-II virus used for the treatment of immunologically medicated disorders of the respiratory system such as sarcoidosis, asthma, and lung cancer, for treatment of allergic disorder such as atopic dermatic and eczema and for Psertains, as well as for the treatment of prevention of infections diseases.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING PRODUCT:-<br>
Tuberculosis is a chronic, infections disease that is caused by infection. Although the infection may be asymptomatic for a considerable period of time, the disease is most commonly manifested as a chronic inflammation of the lungs resulting in fever &amp; respiratory symptoms if left untreated may cause death.<br>
Although tuberculosis can generally be controlled using extended antibiotic therapy, such treatment is not sufficient to prevent the spread of the diseases. Vaccination is also other method for immunological diseases. The most common mycobacterium employed for this purpose is Bacille Calmetic-Guerin. Another mycobacterium that has been used for immunotherapy for tuberculosis and also leprosy is Mycobacterium Vaccal (M. Vaccal).. But it is not effective vaccine.<br>
2<br><br>
Patent 4,716,038, discloses diagnosis o vaccination against and treatment of autoimmune diseases of various types. US Patent 417241144 discloses an immunotherapeutic agent comprising antigenic material derived from M. Vaccal for treatment of Mycabacterial diseases.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
The first objective is to develop a product, which will work effectively in practice and should be used for wide range of diseases and disorder.<br>
Another objective of present invention is to remove the symptoms, the improvements that will occur should be permanent and the diseases should not recur.<br>
The present invention does not cause any side effect to human body.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a homeopathic medicine comprising 1 ml of the serum, obtained by known pathological methods, of a patient detected for HIV-II-virus mixed with 99 drops of ethyl alcohol duly potentized by serial dilutions with a suitable medium and striking with powerful strokes with a mechanical device.<br>
Typically, the suitable medium is ethyl alcohol, distilled water or saline or a combination of any of them.<br>
Typically, the potentization is affected by striking a receptacle field with the medicine with at least 15 strokes.<br>
3<br><br>
Typically, the serial dilutions are serially lc, 2c, 3c, 	30c, ...50c,<br>
...100c, ....200c, ....500c, and the like, every "c" standing for a dilution of 100 times.<br>
Details Description :-<br>
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection has two major type HIV Type-II which are found in the serum of Patient or carriers who are HIV Positive. For the preparation of Homeopathically Potentized (micro-dose) HIV Type - II Virus militer of serum (which contain the virus) Patient who is detected positive for HIV virus is mixed with about 99 drops of ethyl alcohol, which is used as vehicle. This mixture is allow to undergo a process of potentization in which serial dilution is done with powerful strokes with the help of a mechanical device to arrive to Potentized (micro-dose) HIV-Type-II virus 1C i.e. potency. I.e. HIV Type II-1C.<br>
Vehicle is a medium comprises of ethyl alcohol distilled water, normal saline or any such neutral medium.<br>
About 1ml of HIV-Type IIIC is mixed with about 99ml of ethyl alcohol to undergo the same process of Potentization to arrive to HIV-II-2C potency. Similarly, the process is carried out to achieve 3c, 4c, ...30c, — 50c, —100c, 200c, 1000c 1 million and above for clinical use the proportion of original substances (serum) to vehicle may vary from 1:99 to 50:50.<br>

CASE STUDIES:<br>
This is care of Mr. AT (Patient Ref. No. L6925), 40 years old; who reported to the clinic with complaints of psoriasis since about 4 years; He had psariatic lesions spread almost all one over his body and they were increasing since the last 1 year.

He had been on certain allopathic medications for the last 3-4 years and had also been put on steroids for a year. The patient has prescribed HIV-II in increasing patenties 50c, 100c and 150c over a period of time, after a month the improvement slowly started sharing up at the end of 4 months of treatment his problem was almost 70% better and the itching had completely stopped. He did not get dry new lesions. He continued the treatment for another few months for complete recovery from his complaints.<br>
Distinguishing features of present treatment :-<br>
1.	The present medicine has been used effectively for a wide range of diseases and disorder like skin diseases : {soriasis, Urticaria, Lichen Planus warts, Vitiligo, Eczeme and other allergic or immunologically mediated disorders proposed to use for the patients who are HIV positive.<br>
2.	Due to is potentized form, medicine is free from line virus but it is presumed to retain the antigenic properties of the virus. Hence, the new medicine is saft to human.<br>
5<br><br>
3.       Improvement fround with the present invention is permanent,<br>
there is no change of recurrence. Improvement slowly started sharing up at the end fo 4 months of treatment his problem has almost 70% better and the itching had completely stopped. He did not get dry new lesions. He continued the treatment for another few months for another few months for complete recovery from his complaints.<br>
