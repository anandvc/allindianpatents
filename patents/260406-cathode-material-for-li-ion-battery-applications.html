				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is concerned with a family of novel cathode materials and a unique processing method for the materials synthesis for Li-ion batteries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Stoichiometric LiFeP04 cathode material has been discussed for replacing LiCoC&gt;2 type cathode material for lithium ion application because of the potentially lower cost (Fe replacing Co) and the safer operating characteristics of the material (no decomposition of the material during charging). However, present processing issues make the stoichiometric LiFeP04 material expensive and difficult to produce. Presently, LiFeP04 materials suitable for lithium ion battery applications require the synthesis utilizing high temperature heat treatment (&gt;600Â°C) under an inert atmosphere. Also, in order to increase the conductivity of the material, electrically conductive carbon is usually used for enhancing the conductivity and therefore the electrochemical properties of the synthesized material. The use of the inert atmosphere is a key factor that assures the good quality of the materials because of its importance in relation to residual carbon in the material. None of the prior art teaches how to synthesize LiFeP04 material in air, without a protective atmosphere, and how to provide good conductivity of the material and thus good electrochemical properties of a cathode formed of the material.<br>
It is known to use olivine structured material to be the active material for a battery cathode, such as in U.S. Patent No. 5,910,382. Also U. S. Patents US 6,723,470, US 6,730,281, US 6,815,122, US 6,884,544, and US 6,913,855, in general, teach methods and precursors utilized for the formation of stoichiometric LiFeP04, or the substitution of cations for Fe. The above publications only show how stoichiometric olivine structured materials having different cation substitutions are synthesized. None of the prior art teaches how to synthesize phosphate materials having a defective crystalline structure, in air, which have consistent good electrochemical properties for use as an active material in a cathode of a Li-ion battery.<br><br>
In general, defects in the crystalline structure of a material can affect the electrochemical property of the synthesized material drastically. A classical example is the synthesis of stoichiometric LiNi02. A deficiency of lithium would lead to Ni mispositioned on the Li sites therefore retarding the diffusivity of Li drastically and causing the loss in capacity at certain rates. The influence of electrochemical properties caused by misposition of Ni on Li sites has been studied by Chang et al. (Solid State Ionics, 112 (1998) 329-344), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, the concentration of the defects can be affected by different processing precursors and processing protocols. For example, a solution processed precursor would in general possess higher reaction kinetics compared to conventional solid state processes and therefore exhibit lower defect concentration. The reason could be attributed to the fact that LiNiC^ undergoes a decomposition reaction that causes loss of Li during heat treatment. As a result, proper precursors that render high formation kinetics would thus decrease the defect concentration of the synthesized material (Chang et al., Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 149 (2002) A331-A338; 149 (2002) Al 1 14-A1 120), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the present example, although defects can physically retard the diffusivity of Li, the electronic structure of the material could also be affected by the presence of defects and thus the electrical conductivity of the resultant material. It is thus shown that factors such as precursors, processing environment, processing protocols and the kinetics of the reaction to the materials would affect defect concentration and the properties of the resulting material. In the present invention, a family of defective lithium transition metal phosphate material that can be synthesized at low temperature in air atmosphere possessing excellent rate and cycling capability is created. The formation of defects is caused by incorporating various lithiated transition metal oxides with distinct stoichiometry.<br>

Fig. 1 shows the design of a furnace and a heat treatment environment for the synthesis of the materials presently disclosed. Fig. 1 shows reaction vessel 1, which is open to air in furnace 2. The furnace is open to the atmosphere at 3a and 3b so as to maintain substantially atmospheric pressure in the furnace. Flow of gases into or out of the furnace is dependent on heating and cooling cycles of the furnace and chemical reactions taking place with materials in the furnace. Air is free to enter the furnace, and air and/or products of a chemical reaction of materials 4 in the reaction vessel 1 are free to exit the furnace. Materials 4 in vessel 1 react chemically during heating steps to form cathode materials of the invention. Materials 4 in vessel 1, which face air found in the furnace, are covered by a layer of a high temperature inert blanket 5, which is porous to air and escaping gases caused by the heating step. Heating coils of the furnace are indicated at 6.<br>
In the present invention, Fe2O3, Li2CO3, and H3PO4 are particularly chosen as the starting materials for the synthesis of lithium transition metal phosphate. Reasons for the choice include a relatively low cost of the starting material and a chemical reaction that releases C02 and H20, that is: Fe203+Li2C03-t- 2H3P04 + 'A C -* 2 LiFeP04 + 3/2C02 + 3H20. The released gas by-products during reaction can permeate through the porosity of the high temperature inert and porous blanket.<br>
Stoichiometric LiFePCO4 is conventionally known as the "active material" in a cathode for use in a Li-ion battery. However, it has been found that the electrical conductivity of stoichiometric LiFePCO4 is not good and the performance of the battery can be improved with the presence of a material having good electrical conductivity along with the LiFePC^. Carbon is known to be a good material for improving the electrical conductivity of the cathode. It is known to provide an amount of C in the starting material of the above-reaction, which is greater than the stoichiometric amount, so as to provide a residual amount of C with the produced stoichiometric LiFePCÂ»4 cathode material.<br><br>
However, for the reaction to take place at a rate which is reasonable for commercial production, a temperature of about 600Â°C or more is required. At such temperature, decomposition of carbon (for example carbon black) can take place, and the amount of residual C cannot be well controlled. It is known to carry out the synthesis in a controlled inert atmosphere, however commercially producing the material in such a manner adds substantial cost to the production. In the present invention a method has been found to produce a family of novel cathode materials without the use of the above-described controlled atmosphere equipment and process.<br>
In the present invention, a method is provided for making defective lithium transition metal phosphates having a defective crystalline structure that does not require high temperature heat treatment as well as inert atmosphere condition. The way to create the defective structure is to dissolve other lithiated materials with different stoichiometry into a LiFePC&gt;4 structure. The chemistry is proposed as follows:<br><br>
In this case, P and O are deficient and some vacancies would form as indicated by the subscripts shown for P and O. Or,<br><br>
In this case, Li and P and O are deficient and some vacancies would form in the similar way as mentioned in the previous reaction. The reactions proposed are just utilized in explaining the occurrence of defective structured material. However, in the present invention, the target is not to synthesize stoichiometric LiFeP04. As a result, the layer structured or spinel structured lithium transition metal oxides are reacting with an intermediate as-synthesized material that has a molar ratio of Li: Fe: P: C = 1 : 1 : 1 : 2.<br>
In order to facilitate the formation of the above-mentioned defective materials in normal air environment, low temperature heat treatment is utilized for the synthesis. The meaning of low temperature implies just enough temperature for the formation of<br><br>
 . in the present invention, the temperature is chosen to be between 550 to 650Â°C, preferably at 600Â°C.<br>
Too high of a temperature not only increases energy consumption, but also increases the difficulties in maintaining the consistency of the synthesized material.<br>
Features of the present invention include:<br>
A.	No use of an inert atmosphere: This feature results in:<br>
i.   Easy scale up for production, ii.   Much lower cost of a furnace since a gas-tight furnace becomes<br>
unnecessary. Also, the cost of inert gas can be saved, iii.   Overall cost of the synthesis protocol is reduced, iv.   Easy control of the quality of the resultant materials.<br>
B.	Good performance of the synthesized material: Excellent cycling behavior (cycle<br>
life) and rate capability (&gt; 20C of rate capability) are achieved as will be<br>
described in detail in the examples below.<br>
C.	Consistency in performance: This is extremely important for the synthesis of the<br>
material since the consistency of the performance is extremely important for<br>
battery applications.Owing to the formation of the defective crystalline structured<br>
material, not only the conductivity of the as-synthesized material is enhanced, but<br>
also the batch to batch consistency of the as- synthesized materials is obtained,<br>
especially when heat treated in an air environment.<br>
The choice of a low temperature heat treatment can minimize the possibility of decomposition of the desirable defective material. Besides, lower temperature heat treatment (lower than the decomposition temperature of carbon black at ~600Â°C) can also reduce the variations of residual carbon content and distribution during the heat treatment. It should be noted that although variations in the carbon content of the final product in the present invention is not as important as in prior art materials, owing to the high electrical conductivity of the defective material, low temperature heat treatment is still recommended for minimizing unnecessary variations.<br><br>
In the present invention the purpose of adding layer structured or spinel structured materials during synthesis is to create a defective crystalline structure of the resultant material. The importance of the creation of defective crystalline structure is to promote the occurrence of the change of band structure and thus the electrical conductivity of the resultant material. An earlier publication by the present inventor using a computational method, pointed out that the electrochemical property of the material could be influenced significantly by the anions (Chang et al., Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 151 (2004) J91-J94), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Because of the above-described enhancement of electrical conductivity of the defective material, the use of excess carbon and the existence of carbon content in the resultant material become unimportant or unnecessary.<br>
In the present invention a new family of defective crystalline structure lithium metal phosphate materials that can be obtained using an air environment heat treatment, is provided. Excellent electrochemical properties are exhibited. The high rate capability has been demonstrated to be more than 20C.<br>
Following are examples of cathode materials, both prior art materials and cathode materials of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1. Synthesis of conventional stoichiometric LiFePCM using excess carbon under inert atmosphere<br>
Fe2O3 and Li2CO3 and Super P (carbon black), molar ratio of (1:1 :2) were mixed together with the addition of a suitable amount of water to produce a slurry. After mixing thoroughly, the proper Stoichiometric amount of phosphoric acid was added in the solution and extended mixing was utilized. Finally, the slurry was dried in air at 15O0C for 10 hours followed by further heat treatment at 400Â°C for 5 hours until chunks of materials were obtained. The as-prepared material was then subjected to grinding and ball milling for about 12 hours.<br><br>
Heat treatment for synthesis was conducted in a sealed metallic box with the flow of nitrogen gas. The materials were heat treated at 650Â°C for 10 hours under the nitrogen gas flow.<br>
XRD data is shown in Fig. 2. It is observed that phase pure material can be obtained using the described conventional heat treatment protocol. Battery data (obtained using a three electrode design test battery and lithium as the reference electrode) is shown in Figs. 3. From Fig. 3(a) it can be seen that the capacity is high during the first charge-discharge cycle (~C/5 rate, 0.23mA/cm ). The cycles following the first cycle were tested using ~2C test conditions (2.3mA/cm in constant current charge and discharge, with constant voltage charge to current 
EXAMPLE 2. Synthesis of LiNio.92Mgo.os02<br>
Stoichiometric amounts of LiOH, H2O, Ni(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 were mixed in a blender. After 3 hours of mixing, the as-mixed precursor materials were subjected to heat treatment in air at 600Â°C for 10 hours. After gentle crushing and sieving, the materials were then heat treated again in oxygen at 700Â°C for 24 hours.<br>
An XRD pattern of the as-synthesized materials is shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4 it can be seen that the as-synthesized material is phase pure in nature. This suggests that all Mg cations are dissolved in the LiNi02 structure. According to the inventor's earlier publication referred to above, the Mg cations are substituting at the transition metal sites.<br>
EXAMPLE 3. Synthesis of defective lithium transition metal phosphate obtained by incorporating 3 wt% of LiNio.92Mgo.0862 and heat treating in an air environment<br><br>
Fe203, Li2CO3 and Super P (carbon black), molar ratio of (1:1:2) were mixed together with the addition of a suitable amount of water to produce a slurry. After mixing thoroughly, a stoichiometric amount of phosphoric acid was added to the mixture and extended mixing was utilized. Finally, the slurry was dried in air at 150Â°C for 10 hours followed by further heat treatment at 400Â°C for 5 hours until chunks of material were obtained. The as-synthesized intermediate material was then subjected to grinding and ball milling with 3 wt% of LiNio.92Mgo.ogÎ¸2 prepared as described in EXAMPLE 2, for about 12 hours.<br>
Synthesis of the material was carried out by heat treatment at 600Â°C for 10 hours in the furnace shown in Fig. 1, under air atmosphere.<br>
XRD data is shown in Fig. 5. The phase pure nature of the material synthesized is verified by comparing the present XRD data with the XRD data shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that a full dissolution of the layer structured LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 into the LiFePCU is possible. A full dissolution explains the formation of phosphorous and oxygen vacancies during processing. The electrochemical data is shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). From Fig. 6(a) it can be seen that the cycling behavior is much improved compared to the data shown for EXAMPLE 1 in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). No fade in capacity was observed (see Fig. 6(b)), as overlapping of cycling curves is observed. This result suggests that good electrical conductivity of the material is maintained throughout the cycling and thus the material has no fade characteristics. Aside from the improvement in cycling behavior, it is observed that the average discharge voltage has been increased from 3.28V to 3.33V at a 2C discharge rate. This increase suggests that the defective crystalline material has distinct structure and property characteristics in comparison to the conventional stoichiometric LiFeP04. Further supportive evidence is presented in EXAMPLES 6 and 7.<br>
EXAMPLE 4. Fabrication of a 1.5 Ah battery using the material of the invention synthesized in Example 3<br><br>
Cathode preparation: 5 wt% of Super P (50Og) and 5 wt% (50Og) of PVDF were mixed thoroughly with 90 wt% (9kg) of the material of the invention using NMP as a solvent. After stirring and mixing for about 12 hours, a homogeneous slurry was obtained. The slurry had a viscosity of ~ 20,000 cp prior to coating. The slurry was coated on an aluminum foil using a comma coater. The coated film was dried at 140Â°C for approximately 10 minutes in a convective furnace. Similarly, the other side of the aluminum foil was coated with the same material. After drying, the coated foil was subjected to rolling. The resulting compressed films and foil had a thickness of 160Â±5um.<br>
Anode preparation: 8wt% of PVDF and 92 wt% of natural graphite material were mixed thoroughly using NMP as a solvent. After stirring and mixing for about 12 hours a homogeneous slurry was obtained. The slurry had a viscosity of- 15,000 cp prior to coating. The slurry was coated on a copper foil using a comma coater. The coated film was dried at 14O0C for approximately 10 minutes in a convective furnace. Similarly, the other side of the copper foil was coated with the same material. After drying, the coated foil was subjected to coating with a polymer solution as disclosed in the Applicant's earlier U.S. Patent No. U.S. 6,727,017. The as-coated anode was subjected to rolling to a thickness of 210Â±5um.<br>
Battery assembly: A battery was made using 28 pairs of cathodes (4cm x 5cm) and anodes (4cm x 5cm). The electrodes were placed in an alternating sequence, as in ABABAB fashion. After soaking with an electrolyte (EC/DMC 1:1) for about 12 hours, the battery was subjected to cycling.<br>
Table 1 shows the cycling behavior of the resultant battery. The battery shows a capacity of-1200 mAh at a charge/discharge current of 1.5 A. The average voltage of the battery during charge/discharge is also shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. CYCLING BEHAVIOR OF THE BATTERY OF EXAMPLE 5<br><br><br>
The battery was subjected to a high rate capability test at &gt; 20C as follows:<br>
Test setup and configuration: 7 light bulbs (12V, 50W for each bulb) were connected in series with one voltage meter and one ampere meter for monitoring the voltage and current. Four of the batteries of Example 4 were also connected in series and a total voltage of 13.2V was obtained (prior to closing the circuit). On closing the circuit an initial ampere meter reading of &gt;30 Amp and a voltage reading of 10.5V (a total of 315W) was observed. After 10 seconds, the reading of the ampere meter dropped to 28A and the voltage reading dropped to 10.2V (a total of 286W). Thereafter, the readings remained stable for the next 20 seconds.<br>
From the high rate discharge test results described above, it can be concluded that the batteries possessed a high rate capability with a discharge capability of &gt; 20C (a 1C rate is 1.5 A, 20C rate is 30A). This result is significant in revealing that a good cathode material is obtainable under air atmosphere that possesses high rate capabilities. Potential uses of such batters are power tools, vehicles, and large-scale family use power batteries.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. Additional example showing the synthesis of defective lithium transition metal phosphate obtained by incorporating 10 wt% and 20 wt% of LiNiQ.92Mgo.08O2 and heat treating in an air environment<br>
The same processing protocols found in EXAMPLE 3 were utilized for the synthesis of defective lithium transition metal phosphate with additives of 10 wt% and 20 wt%, in place of 3 wt% of Example 3.<br><br>
XRD data is shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). Stronger impurity phase patterns are observed for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 added samples compared to the XRD data shown for pure LiFePCO4 and 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 incorporated material (Figs. 2 and 5, respectively). This suggests that the existence of LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 during synthesis could result in some impurity phases including un-reacted LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 and partially dissolved material.<br>
Electrochemical data is shown in Figs. 8(a) - 8(d). From Figs. 8 it can be seen that the cycling behavior is as good as the 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 incorporated material, although the capacity decreased from 75mAh/g to 50~60mAh/g range. It can be concluded that with the addition of more LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 material, although good electrical conductivity of the material is ensured, owing to the presence of the defective crystalline structure, with too much LiNio.92Mgo.08O2, addition or insufficient heat treatment time would lead to the existence of un- reacted LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 not possessing any capacity. As a result, for the purpose of good control of the performance of the defective lithium iron phosphate type material synthesized in an air environment, the proper amount of LiNio.92Mgo.0sO2 should be added for achieving the best electrical conductivity and capacity of the material. The amount of LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 addition during synthesis is thus very important for obtaining the best electrochemical performance in a battery.<br>
EXAMPLE 6. Comparative study of defective lithium transition metal phosphate (resulting from reactions with different amounts of LiNio.92Mgo.osO2), and LiFeP04 simply mechanically mixed with LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 to different weight percentages<br>
Fig. 9(a) shows a stack of XRD patterns of the conventionally synthesized LiFeP04 (prepared as shown in EXAMPLE 1), defective, lithium transition metal phosphate having 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 (prepared as shown in EXAMPLE 3), defective lithium transition metal phosphate having 10 wt% and 20 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 (prepared as shown in EXAMPLE 5).<br><br>
Fig. 9b shows a stack of XRD patterns of 0" wt%, 3 wt%, 10 wt%, and 20 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 simply mechanically added and mixed with conventional stoichiometric LiFeP04. From Fig. 9(b) it can be seen that with a slight LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 addition (3 wt%), distinct LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 peaks can be observed (-18.6Â° for (003) and 44.4Â° for (104)). This result suggests that the phase pure nature of the 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.ogO2 reacted sample (Example 3) is the result of total dissolution of LiNio.92Mgo.osO2 into the LiFePO4 structure, therefore rendering the presence of phosphorous and oxygen vacancies as discussed. Also, with the same amount of LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 addition in either case, (material of Fig. 9(a) and material of Fig. 9(b)), the LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 added (un-reacted) sample always shows higher (003) and (104) peak intensity (-18.6Â° and 44.4Â°). This suggests that defective lithium transition metal phosphate is a consequence of reactions between the as-synthesized precursor materials (as described in EXAMPLE 3 and 5). The characteristics are distinct from material simply mechanically mixed with LiNio.92Mgo.OgO2 to different weight percentages.<br>
EXAMPLE 7. Chemical analyses for conventional LiFePO4 (material made in EXAMPLE 1) and defective lithium transition metal phosphate synthesized by incorporating 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.o8O2 (material made in EXAMPLE 3)<br>
The chemical analysis results for both conventional LiFePCO4 (material made in EXAMPLE 1) and defective lithium transition metal phosphate incorporated with 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 (material made in EXAMPLE 3) are shown in Table 2. The calculated stoichiometry numbers for the two samples are obtained by converting the wt% to mol% for each element while setting the stoichiometry of Fe and (Fe+Ni+Mg) to unity. In the case of conventional LiFeP04, the calculated stoichiometry ratio of Fe: P =1: 0.9805. Similarly, the 3 wt% incorporated material possesses a stoichiometry ratio of Li: (Fe+Ni+Mg): P =1: 0.9534. A deficiency of phosphorous supports the proposed formation of vacancies during the reaction. It should be noticed that the oxygen content can not be analyzed chemically. However, if we assume a 100 wt% of the sample being analyzed, the stoichiometric numbers for the 3 wt% incorporated material is still smaller than the conventional material. This is still consistent with the proposed oxygen vacancy formation during the synthesis.<br><br>
Table 2. Chemical analyses for materials synthesized in EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE<br>
3+<br><br>
* The Li, Fe, P, Ni, and Mg were analyzed using ICP-OES The C was analyzed using ASTM D5373<br>
+ The oxygen content can not be determined directly owing to the relatively high concentrations of metals.<br>
EXAMPLE 8. Synthesis of defective lithium transition metal phosphate incorporated with spinel structured Li1.07Mm.93O4 (3 wt%) in air environment<br>
Fe203, Li2C03 and Super P (carbon black), molar ratio of (1:1:2) were mixed together with the addition of a suitable amount of water. After mixing thoroughly, a stoichiometric amount of phosphoric acid was added to the solution and extended mixing was utilized. Finally, the slurry was dried in air at 150Â°C for 10 hours followed by further heat treatment at 400Â°C for 5 hours until chunks of materials were obtained.<br>
Lii.07Mn1.93O4 was synthesized using Li2C03, and Mn304 with a stoichiometric ratio of Li: Mn of 1.1: 2 in the precursor. The starting materials Li2C03 and Mn304 were first mixed using a ball mill for 8 hours, followed by heat treating the material to 800Â°C for 24 hours in air. The material obtained was then subjected to grinding and sieving.<br><br>
The materials prepared above were then subjected to grinding and ball milling for about 12 hours with the amount of Li i,07MnL93O4 being 3 wt%. Further heat treatment at 600Â°C for 10 hours in the furnace shown in Fig. 1 under air atmosphere was conducted on the materials.<br>
The XRD data is shown in Fig. 10. Slightly more impurity phases are observed compared to the XRD data shown for pure LiFeP04 and 3 wt% LiNio.92Mgo.08O2 incorporated material. Electrochemical data is shown in Figs. 1 1(a) and 1 1(b). From Fig. 1 1(a) it can be seen that the cycling behavior is much improved compared to the data shown in EXAMPLE 1. No fade in capacity was observed (see Fig. 1 1(b)), as overlapping of cycling curves is observed. This result suggests that good electrical conductivity of the material is maintained throughout the cycling and thus the material possesses no fade characteristics.<br>
