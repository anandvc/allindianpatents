FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell and, more particularly, to a<br>
fuel cell barrier film that minimizes softgood intrusion into a flow field of a fuel cell<br>
stack plate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient and environmentally<br>
responsible power source for various applications. In particular, individual fuel<br>
cells can be stacked together in series to form a fuel cell stack capable of<br>
supplying a quantity of electricity sufficient to power an electric vehicle.<br>
Accordingly, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential alternative for a<br>
traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern vehicles. A common type of fuel cell is known as a proton exchange membrane<br>
(PEM) fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell includes three basic components: a cathode,<br>
an anode and an electrolyte membrane. The cathode and anode typically<br>
include a finely divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon particles<br>
and mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between<br>
the cathode and the anode to form a membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA). The<br>
MEA is disposed between porous diffusion media (DM). The DM facilitates a<br>
delivery of gaseous reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen from air, to an<br>
active region defined by the MEA for an electrochemical fuel cell reaction.<br>
Nonconductive gaskets and seals electrically insulate the various components of<br>
the fuel cell. When the MEA and the DM are laminated together as a unit, for example,<br>
with other components such as gaskets and the like, the assembly is called a<br>
unitized electrode assembly (UEA). The UEA is disposed between fuel cell<br>
plates, which act as current collectors for the fuel cell. The UEA components<br>
disposed between the fuel cell plates are typically called "softgoods". The fuel<br>
cell plate has a feed region that uniformly distributes the gaseous reactants to<br><br>
and between the fuel cells of the fuel cell stack. The feed region may have a<br>
broad span that facilitates a joining of the fuel cell plates, e.g., by welding, and a<br>
shifting of flows between different elevations within the jointed plates. The feed<br>
region includes supply ports that distribute the gaseous reactants from a supply<br>
manifold to the active region of the fuel cell via a flow field formed in the fuel cell<br>
plate. The feed region also includes exhaust ports that distribute the residual<br>
gaseous reactants and products from the flow field to an exhaust manifold.<br>
 Lower performing cell (LPC) conditions, fuel cell instability, and<br>
degradation due to reactant starvation or non-uniformity of reactant flow have<br>
been observed when at least one of the softgood components is forced into the<br>
port features in a phenomenon known as "softgood intrusion." Softgood intrusion<br>
occurs when there is a pressure differential between a cathode side and an<br>
anode side of the barrier film sufficient to deflect the softgoods into the port<br>
features. The pressure differential often occurs during normal operation of the<br>
fuel cell.<br>
 It is known in the art to support the softgoods in the feed region and inhibit<br>
softgood intrusion by adding a metal shim or foil. Metal shims have been used<br>
to sandwich and sufficiently support the softgoods against deflection. However,<br>
the use of metal shims is undesirable since the shims must have a strength and<br>
thickness that resists deflection of the softgoods under the pressure differential.<br>
The metal shim must also be sufficiently bonded to the softgoods to inhibit a<br>
separation therefrom over repeated fuel cell operation. The employment of metal<br>
shims undesirably adds to a complexity and cost of the fuel cell.<br>
 There is a continuing need for a fuel cell that provides sufficient softgood<br>
support without the use of metal shims. Desirably, the fuel cell minimizes<br>
softgood intrusion and militates against low performing cell conditions, fuel cell<br>
instability, and fuel cell degradation due to reactant starvation or non-uniformity<br>
of reactant flow to the fuel cell.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 In concordance with the instant disclosure, a barrier film for a fuel cell that<br>
minimizes softgood intrusion and militates against low performing cell conditions,<br>
fuel cell instability, and fuel cell degradation due to reactant starvation or<br>
nonuniformity of reactant flow to the fuel cell, is surprisingly discovered. In one embodiment, a barrier film for a fuel cell includes a polymeric<br>
membrane having a plurality of support features. The support features are<br>
adapted to militate against a deflection of the membrane under a pressure<br>
differential across the membrane.<br>
 In another embodiment, a fuel cell having the barrier film is provided. The<br>
fuel cell includes a first plate having a port formed therein, and a second plate<br>
disposed adjacent the first plate. The barrier film is disposed between the first<br>
plate and the second plate, and adapted to militate against an intrusion of the<br>
membrane into the port during an operation of the fuel cell.<br>
 A plurality of the fuel cells may be arranged in series to form a fuel cell<br>
stack. The fuel cell stack that has sufficient softgood support without the use of<br>
metal shims is thereby provided.<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS The above, as well as other advantages of the present disclosure, will<br>
become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed<br>
description, particularly when considered in the light of the drawings described<br>
hereafter. FIG. 1A illustrates a schematic, exploded perspective view of an<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. FIGS. 1A,1B, and1C depict an exemplary fuel cell stack 2 of the prior art.<br>
For purposes of illustration, only two fuel cells 3 are shown, it being understood<br>
that a typical fuel cell stack 2 will have many more fuel cells 3. The fuel cells 3<br>
are typically stacked together between a pair of clamping plates (not shown) and<br>
a pair of unipolar end plates (not shown). The fuel cell stack 2 has a feed region<br>
4 configured to transport a gaseous reactant to or from an active region 5 the fuel<br>
cell stack 2. The fuel cell stack 2 further includes a first plate 6 and a second plate 8.<br>
The first and second plates 6, 8 may be unipolar or bipolar plates, for example,<br>
having a plurality of flow channels 10 and a plurality of lands 11 formed thereon.<br>
The flow channels 10 are configured to deliver the gaseous reactants to the<br>
active region 5 of the fuel cell stack 2. It should be understood that the feed<br>
region 4 is generally disposed between the first and second plates 6, 8 when the<br><br>
fuel cell stack 2 is assembled. Similarly, the active region 5 is also disposed<br>
between the first and second plates 6, 8, adjacent the feed region 4, when the<br>
plates 6, 8 are assembled to form the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
 At least one unsupported softgood 12 of the fuel cell stack 2 is disposed<br>
between the first and second fuel cell plates 6, 8. As a nonlimiting example, the<br>
softgood 12 includes at least one of an electrolyte membrane and an anode or<br>
cathode. The electrolyte membrane, anode, and cathode may be assembled as<br>
an MEA 14, for example. The unsupported softgood 12 may further include other<br>
softgood 12 components as is known in the art. Being unsupported, the softgood<br>
12 is not buttressed by a metal shim or foil. The softgood 12 may extend from<br>
the active region 5 of the fuel cell stack 2 to a gasket 16 disposed between the<br>
first and second fuel cell plates 6, 8. As a nonlimiting example, the softgood 12<br>
is an electrolyte membrane that is disposed along both the active region 5 and<br>
the feed region 4 of the fuel cell stack 2, and ending substantially at the gasket<br>
16. The gasket 16 may have at least one seal 17 formed thereon.<br>
 The softgood 12 may have a laminated structure. The laminated structure<br>
may include at least one of the electrolyte membrane, the anode, the cathode,<br>
the DM, and other suitable softgood components as desired. When the softgood<br>
12 in the feed region 4 is one of the electrolyte membrane, the anode, and the<br>
cathode, the softgood 12 may be coated or laminated with a substantially inert<br>
material to militate against any undesired interaction with the first and second<br>
fuel cell plates 6, 8. The undesired interaction may include a corrosion of the first<br>
and second fuel cell plates 6, 8 and a degradation of the softgood 12. The fuel cell stack 2 includes a manifold 18 formed by an alignment of<br>
respective manifold apertures in the fuel cell plates 6, 8 and the softgood<br>
component 12. The manifold 18 is in fluid communication with a source of the<br>
gaseous reactant, such as an air compressor or a hydrogen storage tank, for<br>
example. The manifold 18 is configured to deliver the gaseous reactant to the<br>
fuel cell stack 2 as desired, for example, via the feed region 4. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the feed region 4 is defined by a volume between the first and<br>
second plates 6, 8 adjacent the manifold 18. At least one of the seals 17 of the<br><br>
gasket 16 may be disposed adjacent the manifold 18 and militate against<br>
undesirable leakage of the gaseous reactant into the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
 The first fuel cell plate 6 has a plurality of ports 20 formed therein. At least<br>
one of the ports 20 is in fluid communication with the manifold 18. It should be<br>
understood that the ports 20 may include one of an inlet port configured to deliver<br>
gaseous reactants to the active region 5 of the fuel cell stack 2, and an outlet port<br>
configured to remove gaseous reactants from the active region 5.<br>
 As shown in FIGS. 1B and 1C, the unsupported softgood 12 may deflect<br>
into the port 20 during an operation of the fuel cell stack 2. The deflection may<br>
occur, for example, due to a pressure differential that occurs across the softgood<br>
12. The pressure differential may result from a difference in pressure of the<br>
gaseous reactants on an anode side and a cathode side of the softgood 12. The<br>
deflection may occur due to a change in material integrity or stiffness at elevated<br>
temperatures attained during operation of the fuel cell stack 2. It should be<br>
appreciated that the forcing of the unsupported softgood 12 into the port 20<br>
undesirably restricts a flow of the gaseous reactants to and from various regions<br>
of the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
 Various embodiments according to the present invention are shown in<br>
FIGS. 2 to 6. For purpose of clarity, related structure from FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C<br>
includes the same reference numeral with a prime (') symbol.<br>
 Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the fuel cell stack 2' of the disclosure includes<br>
a barrier film 200 disposed between the first and second plates 6', 8'. The barrier<br>
film 200 is formed from a polymeric membrane. The barrier film 200 does not<br>
degrade significantly with exposure to fuel cell operating temperatures and fluids,<br>
such as the gaseous reactants employed in the fuel cell 2' electrochemical<br>
reaction. The barrier film 200 may be a substantially homogenous sheet or a<br>
laminated structure adapted to optimize a strength thereof, as desired.<br>
 The barrier film 200 provides electrical insulation between individual cells<br>
of the fuel cell stack 2'. The barrier film 200 may also have at least one polymeric<br>
seal 202 formed thereon. As a nonlimiting example the barrier film 200 is formed<br>
from one of a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), a polyethylene terephthalate<br><br>
(PET), and a polyimide polymer (for example, Kapton®). The polymeric seal 202<br>
is formed from one of a silicone rubber, an ethylene propylene diene rubber<br>
(EPDM), and a fluorosilicone . It should be understood that other suitable<br>
polymeric materials for the barrier film 200 and the polymeric seal 202 may be<br>
selected as desired. A skilled artisan should also understand that the barrier film<br>
200 and the polymeric seal 202 may be formed from the same material as<br>
desired. The barrier film 200 is coupled to other softgoods (not shown) of the fuel<br>
cell stack 2'. As a nonlimiting example, the barrier film 200 may be coupled to at<br>
least one of an electrolyte membrane, an anode, and a cathode. In another<br>
embodiment, the barrier film 200 is coupled to a DM. In particular embodiments,<br>
the barrier film 200 is also coupled to a nonconductive gasket. For example, the<br>
barrier film 200 may be integral with the nonconductive gasket. In a particularly<br>
illustrative embodiment, the barrier film 200 is coupled to both the electrolyte<br>
membrane and the nonconductive gasket.<br>
 The barrier film 200 may be coupled to the other softgoods of the fuel cell<br>
stack 2' by at least one of a chemical adhesive and physical bonding, such as a<br>
bonding caused by physical interlocking or friction under compression. It should<br>
be understood that at least one of the electrolyte membrane, the anode, the<br>
cathode, and the DM may be laminated with the barrier film 200 over a portion of<br>
the feed region 4'. In another embodiment, at least one of the electrolyte<br>
membrane, the anode, the cathode, and the DM does not extend substantially<br>
into the feed region 4'. Other suitable configurations may be selected as desired.<br>
 The barrier film 200 of the present disclosure has a plurality of support<br>
features 204. The support features 204 are adapted to militate against an<br>
undesired deflection of the barrier film 200 when a pressure differential forms<br>
across the barrier film 200. For example, when the fuel cell stack 2' has a<br>
pressure differential between a cathode side and an anode side of the barrier film<br>
200, the support features 204 may abut the first plate 6' and buttress the barrier<br>
film 200. Since the support features 204 abut the first plate 6' and inhibit the<br><br>
deflection of the barrier film 200, an intrusion of the barrier film 200 into the port<br>
20' is militated against.<br>
 The support features 204 of the barrier film 200 may be integral with the<br>
membrane 201. As shown in FIG. 2, at least one of the support features 204<br>
may be a hollow node formed from the polymeric membrane of the barrier film<br>
200. The hollow node may be formed by any suitable operation for forming<br>
nodes in the barrier film 200, such as by a molding operation or a stamping<br>
operation, for example. At least one of the support features may be a<br>
substantially solid node, such as shown in FIG. 3. In certain embodiments, the<br>
support features 204 are deposited on the barrier film 200. Suitable materials for<br>
the deposited support features 204 include those suitable for use as the<br>
polymeric membrane of the barrier film 200, and may be selected as desired. A<br>
skilled artisan should also appreciate that suitable support feature 204 shapes<br>
may be selected as desired.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 4, the plurality of support features 204 may have a<br>
substantially columnar alignment on the barrier film 200. For example, the<br>
plurality of support features 204 includes a first quantity of support features 300<br>
and a second quantity of support features 302. The first and second quantities<br>
300, 302 are disposed in a spaced apart arrangement. In one embodiment, the<br>
first and second quantities 300, 302 are disposed on the barrier film 200 in<br>
columns that are substantially parallel to one another. Referring to FIG. 5, at<br>
least one of the first quantity 300 and the second quantity 302 of support features<br>
204 may have a staggered alignment on the barrier film 200. Staggering the<br>
support features 204 may militate against a formation of an undesirable<br>
continuous bend deflection of the barrier film 200 in operation. Other suitable<br>
configurations of the plurality of support features 302 may also be selected.<br>
 In particular embodiments, a base 600 of the support feature 204 may be<br>
disposed beneath a plane defined by a surface of the barrier film 200. As shown<br>
in FIG. 6, the first quantity 300 of support features 204 may be disposed in a<br>
channel 602 formed in the barrier film 200. The first and second quantities 300,<br>
302 of the support features 204 may also be configured to bias the barrier film<br><br>
200 in a desired direction. The bias induced in the barrier film 200 may be<br>
sufficient to create a desirable bend deflection of the barrier film 200 in operation.<br>
It should be understood that a biasing of the barrier film 200 may increase a<br>
beam strength of additional components disposed on the barrier film in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the bend direction.<br>
 It is surprisingly found that the inclusion of the support features 204 on the<br>
barrier film 200 of the present disclosure minimizes an intrusion of the barrier film<br>
200 and any other laminated softgoods into the port 20'. The minimization of the<br>
softgood intrusion with barrier film 200 militates against low performing cell (LPC)<br>
conditions, fuel cell instability, and reactant starvation or non-uniformity of<br>
reactant flow to the fuel cell and the resultant fuel cell degradation.<br>
 While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown<br>
for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
disclosure, which is further described in the following appended claims.<br><br>
