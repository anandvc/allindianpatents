				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a CNC controlled buttonhole sewing<br>
machine.<br>
The JUKI MEB-32OO Instruction Manual No. O2 29343316 leaflet<br>
describes a CNC controlled buttonhole sewing machine of the<br>
generic type. It comprises an x—y table which is displaceable on<br>
the sewing plane by two stepper motors as x and y drives- Two<br>
work piece clamps are disposed on the x—y table, holding a work<br>
piece thereon. By means of a pneumatic cylinder, they are<br>
displaceable in the x direction on the sewing plant) which is<br>
formed by the x—y plane, in mirror symmetry to a center plane.<br>
Both phenumatic cylinders are operable by means of a control<br>
command that is stored in the control unit. Provided on each side<br>
of the x—y table are setscrews, enabling the length of spread of<br>
each work piece clamp to be set from a non—modifiable inner<br>
initial position of spread to a final position of spread.<br>
Shifting the work piece clamps enables the tightly clamped work<br>
piece to be stretched and spread into a tautened plain position.<br>
It is possible in this way to produce high quality buttonholes.<br>
Stretching the work piece also creates sufficient room for the<br>
needle, in case the buttonhole is first cut and then sewn i.e.<br>
with the sewing machine working in a so-called pre-conditioning<br>
mode. The displacement of each work piece clamp is in the range<br>
of 1.0 mm so that the clamps can be moved apart by a length of<br>
spread of 2.0 mm. The length of spread depends on various sewing<br>
parameters such as the structure of the work piece i.e., material<br>
thickness and the like, the kind of threads used for sewing,<br>
thread tightening, needle size, possible use of a gimp thread and<br>
further parameters.<br>
The solution according to the invention ensures that the length<br>
af spread can be given very conveniently by control unit input so<br>
that the ranges in length of spread that correspond to the<br>
respective sewing conditions are easily adjustable. This includes<br>
work piece quality, buttonhole seam parameters, ranges of<br>
tightening of the threads sewn. This will increase the quality of<br>
a buttonhole by very precise adjustment of the final position of<br>
spread after displacement, by the length of spread, of the work<br>
piece clamps from the initial position of spread into the final<br>
position of spread. Initial position of spread means the distance<br>
of the workpiece clamps in their close side—by position of rest.<br>
Final position of spread means a position of the work piece<br>
clamps in which they are moved out of the initial position by the<br>
length of spread. These adjustment and input jobs can be<br>
managed by the operator, which means great convenience of<br>
handling. Adjustment is feasible without the need of special<br>
aids. Machine down—times are kept low because very little time is<br>
consumed by the adjustment jobs. The operating mechanic is<br>
relieved. The entered control data constitutes a basis for<br>
further processing of the set-ups in a display and/or for calling<br>
stored sewing programs. Manufacturing high quality buttonholes<br>
becomes reproducible.<br>
The further development of the invention ensures that also<br>
the initial position of spread can be suited to the envisaged<br>
shape and size of a buttonhole seam, enabling the work piece to<br>
be clamped in proximity to the seam that is to be sewn. This<br>
results in especially reliable stitch forming and excellent<br>
buttonhole quality.<br>
In keeping with the especially advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, only a single work piece clamp must be movable on<br>
the x—y table, a compensating motion being produced by the<br>
possibility of displacement of the x—y table. This reduces the<br>
number of components required, leading to more reliable operation<br>
and a lower manufacturing cost.<br>
The invention further specifies an advantageous embodiment<br>
in which, at least by the displaceable work piece clamp, no<br>
forces are transmitted to the guides of the work piece clamp on<br>
the x-y table. No frictional forces that might oppose the<br>
displacement of the work piece clamp for spreading are occasioned<br>
in positioning the work piece clamp. The forces that occasion<br>
when a work piece is clamped are kept within the work piece clamp<br>
itself. This works in favor of the repidity and accuracy of the<br>
spreading job. Lightweight construction of the entire spreading<br>
arrangement is possible, saving material consumption.<br>
Details of the invention will became apparent from the<br>
ensuing description of three exemplary embodiments, taken in<br>

Fig. 8 is a diagrammatic view of a second embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion;<br>
Fig. 9 is a partial lateral view of a third embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion;<br>
Fig. 10 is a horizontal section of the third embodiment on the line<br>
X-X of Fig. 9; and<br>
Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view of the third embodiment on the line<br>
XI-XI in Fig. 9.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, a buttonhole sewing machine is C shaped, having a top<br>
arm 1, a bottom base plate 22 in the form of a casing and an approximately<br>
vertical standard 3 that unites the two. An arm shaft 4 is conventionally<br>
lodged in the arm 1; it is drivable by a motor 4a which is only roughly out-<br>
lined in Fig. 5. The actuation of a vertically displaceable needle bar 5 with<br>
a needle 6 and a jogging drive mechanism therefor customarily derive from<br>
the arm shaft 4.<br>
Disposed on the base plate 2 is an x-y table 7 which is a cross slide that is<br>
movable in two horizontal coordinate directions, namely the x and the y<br>
direction. The x-y table 7 is of conventional design as known for example<br>
from DE 198 07 771 A1 (corresponding to U.S. patent 6 095 066). Actuation<br>
of the x-y table 7 takes place by drives roughly outlined only in Fig. 5,<br>
namely an x drive 8 and a y drive 9, which are electric positioning motors,<br>
preferably stepper motors or controllable D.C. motors.<br>
Disposed on the x-y table 7 is a base plate 10 by way of which a linear ball<br>
bearing guide 11 is supported on the x-y table 7 for displacement in the x<br>
direction. It is movable in the x direction by a sliding drive 12 in the form<br>
of a stepper motor. As seen in Figs. 3 and 4, this drive 12 is mounted on the<br>
x-y table 7, acting on the base plate 10 by way of a cam 14, which is<br>
mounted on its shaft 13, and a crosshead sliding connection 14a, which<br>
cooperates therewith, so that maximum displacements of the base plate 10<br>
in the x direction are possible, corresponding to twice the eccentricity of<br>
the cam 14. The lengths of displacement are in the range of approximately<br>
2 mm.<br>
A two-piece supporting plate 15a, 15b is arranged above the base plate 10.<br>
The left sectional supporting plate 15a - seen in the y direction - is<br>
mounted by screws 16a on the x-y table 7; it is stationary thereon. As opposed<br>
to this, the right sectional supporting plate 15b - seen in the y direc-<br>
tion - is mounted by screws 16b on the displaceable base plate 10; it is<br>
movable along with the base plate 10 in the x direction. The top sides of<br>
the sectional supporting plates 15a, 15b are located on a joint x-y plane.<br>
A work piece clamp 17a and 17b is mounted on each sectional supporting<br>
plate 15a and 15b, comprising a sectional bearing plate 18a, 18b which is<br>
mounted on the respective sectional supporting plate 15 a, 15b and to each<br>
of which is allocated a clamping plate 19a and 19b, respectively. The<br>
clamping plates 19a, 19b are mounted on bearing levers 20 which are<br>
lodged by means of a pivot bearing 21 on the associated sectional supporting<br>
plate 15a and 15b. The work piece clamps 17a and 17b - apart from<br>
their pivotability about the pivot bearing 21 - are stationary relative to the<br>
respective sectional supporting plate 15a, 15b. The work piece clamps 17a,<br>
17b are pivoted by actuating levers 22 which are operated by a pneumatically<br>
actuated clamping drive 22a. The respective sectional bearing plate<br>
18a, 18b and the respective clamping plate 19a and 19b have sectional<br>
openings 23a, 23b that combine to form an opening which, at a small distance,<br>
encloses a buttonhole seam 24 that is to be produced.<br>
The sectional supporting plates 15 a, 15b can be moved towards each other,<br>
abutting on a vertical center plane 25 where they and the work piece<br>
clamps 17a, 17b have their respective zero position. In this position, the<br>
opposing edges 26a, 26b of the sectional supporting plates 15a, 15b bear<br>
against each other. On this plane 25, a stationary knife 27 for cutting a but-<br>
tonhole 28 is disposed on the base plate 2 of the sewing machine. This<br>
knife 27 is part of a cutting device 29 which also includes an anvil 30<br>
mounted on the bottom side of the arm 1 by means of a cutting drive 31.<br>
The sewing machine is provided with a control unit 32 which triggers the x<br>
drive 8, the y drive 9, the sliding drive 12, the drives 22a for the work piece<br>
clamps 17, 17b, the driving motor 4a of the arm shaft 4 and the cutting<br>
drive 31. The control unit 32 comprises a storage element 33. Furthermore,<br>
an operating unit 34 is allocated to the control unit 32, having a keyboard<br>
35 and a display 36.<br>
Programs and data are stored in the storage element 33, concerning the initial<br>
position of spread and the buttonhole seam 24 that is to be produced.<br>
Furthermore, lengths of spread are stored, which are allocated to the type<br>
and shape of the buttonhole seam 24 and the material quality.<br>
Before a sewing operation is started, the drives 8, 9 in the form of stepper<br>
motors conventionally move the x-y table 7 in accordance with the data<br>
stored in the storage element 33 into a zero position, in which the edges<br>
26a, 26b of the sectional supporting plates 15a, 15b abut on the plane 25<br>
and the center plane 25 also holds the needle 6 in its vertical central position.<br>
Zero positioning of this type is general practice in sewing control<br>
technique and does not require any further explanation. By corresponding<br>
actuation of the operating unit 34, the operator selects a certain type of but-<br>
tonhole 28 with a buttonhole seam 24. The operator also calls a corre-<br>
sponding control program which the material data and the like are allocated<br>
to.<br>
The mentioned zero positioning takes place automatically by input of the<br>
start of the sewing operation. Corresponding triggering of the sliding drive<br>
12 moves the base plate 10, together with the sectional supporting plate<br>
15b and the work piece clamp 17b, into an initial position of spread in<br>
which the longitudinal edges 37a, 37b, defining the sectional openings 23a,<br>
23b, of the clamping plates 19a, 19b have a distance a from each other that<br>
corresponds to the total width b of the buttonhole seam 24 plus a distance c<br>
of for instance 0.5 mm between the buttonhole seam 24 and each neighboring<br>
longitudinal edge 37a and 37b. If the clamping plates 19a, 19b, by their<br>
sectional openings 23 a, 23b, are adapted to the buttonhole seam 24 that is<br>
to be produced, then there is no need of any adjustment operation of the<br>
type mentioned above; only the x-y table 7 has to be set to zero position.<br>
Then the operator releases the work piece clamps 17a, 17b via the operating<br>
unit 34 or automatically in accordance with the stored sewing program;<br>
the operator may then place and align the work piece 38 on the bearing<br>
plates 18a, 18b. Subsequently, the work piece clamps 17a, 17b are closed<br>
by corresponding actuation of the drive 22a so that the work piece 38 is<br>
clamped by both work piece clamps 17a, 17b. Afterwards, displacement of<br>
the base plate 10, together with the work piece clamp 17b, in the x direction<br>
by the length of spread d stored in the storage element 33 takes place<br>
fully automatically by means of the sliding drive 12. Simultaneously or<br>
directly afterwards, the x-y table 7 is moved by a length d/2 in the reversed<br>
direction so that the two bearing plates 18a, 18b are in their final position<br>
of spread again in mirror symmetry to the center plane 25. As a result, the<br>
sectional openings 23a, 23b are again in mirror symmetry to the center<br>
plane 25. The clamped and spread work piece 38 is positioned underneath<br>
the needle 6 in a position that is precisely defined for execution of the sewing<br>
operation. Solid lines in Fig. 6 illustrate the initial position of the<br>
clamping plate 19b and dashed lines show the position of spread after displacement<br>
of the base plate 10 by the length of spread d but prior to compensation<br>
through reversal of the x-y table 7 by half the length of spread<br>
d/2. Cutting the buttonhole 28 by means of the knife 27 may take place<br>
prior to the buttonhole 28 sewing job or afterwards. As seen in Fig. 7, the<br>
buttonhole seam 24 is a conventional flat stitch seam produced by a corresponding<br>
needle jogging drive of the needle bar 5. Stay stitches (not<br>
shown) may be sewn additionally at the end of the buttonhole seam 24 that<br>
is opposite the buttonhole eye 39.<br>
Fig. 8 diagrammatically illustrates another embodiment in which two supporting<br>
plates 15'a, 15'b are disposed on the x-y table 7' for displacement in<br>
the x direction on linear ball bearing guides 11'. A spindle 40 serves for<br>
displacement, having opposed threads 41a, 41b that engage with spindle<br>
nuts 42a, 42b. The spindle nuts 42a, 42b are joined to the supporting plates<br>
15'a, 15'b. By corresponding triggering of the sliding drive 12' on the x-y<br>
table 7', the supporting plates 15'a, 15'b are moved in the x direction towards<br>
or away from each other in mirror symmetry to the center plane 25.<br>
The work piece clamps (not shown in Fig. 8) are disposed on the supporting<br>
plates 15'a, 15'b in the same way as in the embodiment described<br>
above. Zero positioning of the x-y table 7' also takes place in the embodiment<br>
of Fig. 8; spreading of the work piece clamps (not shown) together<br>
with the work piece takes place in the same way; however, there is no need<br>
of compensation of the length of spread by reversal of the x-y table T by<br>
i half the length of spread d/2.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figs. 9 to 11, two supporting plates are<br>
disposed on an x-y table 7, of which only the supporting plate 15"b is outlined.<br>
Design and positioning correspond to the first embodiment. This<br>
' embodiment differs from those described above in that at least the work<br>
piece clamp 17"b, which is mounted on the supporting plate 15"b that is<br>
movable relative to the x-y table 7, is operated by a clamping drive 43 that<br>
is mounted on the supporting plate 15"b. To this end, the double-armed<br>
bearing lever 20", which carries the clamping plate 19b, is mounted by a<br>
pivot bearing 44 in a drive and bearing casing 45 that is fixed by screws 46<br>
to the bottom side of the supporting plate 15"b. Both parts are joined together<br>
on their contact surfaces for compressed-air tightness by use of a<br>
liquid sealant (not shown).<br>
Formed in the casing 45 is a cylindrical chamber 47, which is open upwards<br>
and downwards and in which a piston 48 is sealed and disposed for<br>
up and down motion. This piston 48 comprises a piston rod 49 which extends<br>
downwards from the cylindrical chamber 47 and which is articulated<br>
by a joint 50 to the end, turned towards the piston rod 49, of the bearing<br>
lever 20". A compressed-air duct 51 is formed by the side of the cylindrical<br>
chamber 47 in the casing 45; on the top side of the casing 45, the duct 51 is<br>
connected to the cylindrical chamber 47 by means of an overflow conduit<br>
52. This unit constitutes a unilaterally actuated pneumatic piston-cylinder<br>
unit. On the bottom side of the casing 45, a compressed-air pipe 53 opens<br>
into the compressed-air duct 51; it includes a solenoid valve 43' that is triggered<br>
by the control unit 32.<br>
A borehole 54 is provided in the casing 45 by the side of the compressed-<br>
air duct 51, with a preloaded extension spring 55 disposed therein which is<br>
secured to the top side of the casing 45 by a retaining pin 57 and to the<br>
bearing lever 20" by another retaining pin 57. By means of the preloaded<br>
extension spring 55, the lever section 58a between the pivot axis 44 and the<br>
joint 50 is pulled upwards towards the clamping drive 43 so that the lever<br>
58b of the bearing lever 20" is pivoted upwards i.e., the clamping plate 19b<br>
is lifted off the supporting plate 15"b. If, however, compressed air flows<br>
via the compressed-air pipe 53, the compressed-air duct 51 and the overflow<br>
conduit 52 into the chamber 47 above the piston 48, then the piston<br>
48, inclusive of the lever section 58a, is shifted upwards counter to the<br>
force of the extension spring 55 so that the lever section 58b, together with<br>
the clamping plate 19b, is pivoted towards the supporting 15"b, whereby<br>
any possibly available work piece 38 is clamped.<br>
A setscrew 59 is disposed in the lever section 58a, bearing against the casing<br>
45; it serves to adjust the length by which the clamping plate 19b is<br>
lifted.<br>
Arranging the clamping drive 43 between the bearing lever 20" and the<br>
supporting plate 15"b ensures that the forces that act within the work piece<br>
clamp 17"b are kept within the clamp and do not act on the x-y table 7".<br>
The other supporting plate and clamping plate are embodied in the same<br>
way. This design of the work piece clamps can be put into practice not only<br>
in the exemplary embodiment according to Figs. 1 to 7, but also in the em-<br>
bodiment of Fig. 8.<br>
