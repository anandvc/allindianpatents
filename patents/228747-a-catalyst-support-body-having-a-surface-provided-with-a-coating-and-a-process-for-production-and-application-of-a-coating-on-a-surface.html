				<td>COATED CATALYST SUPPORT BODY<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst support body having a surface on which a coating is provided. Such catalyst support bodies serve for the catalytic reaction of reactants, for example in the partial oxidation of propene and acrolein to form acrolein and acrylic acid, respectively. The invention relates also to a process for the production of a coating for a catalyst support body, a process for the preparation of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, a process for the production of a water-absorbing polymer, a process for the production of a water-absorbing hygiene article as well as to chemical products or to the use of (meth)acrylic acid in chemical products.<br>
Reactors for carrying out catalysed endothermic or exothermic reactions are known in various forms in the prior art. In catalysed processes on a large industrial scale, the reactants are usually passed over flowable catalyst particles (loose material) which are arranged in a reaction chamber. The reactants are brought into contact with the catalyst, which promotes a reaction. Because such reactions nevertheless frequently achieve high conversion rates only within a certain temperature range (even though it may be a relatively low temperature range) it is particularly important that those temperatures be maintained accurately over as long as possible a period, it being especially of concern that, in the case of chemical reactions that proceed exothermically, heat is dissipated sufficiently to avoid an uncontrolled progression of chemical reactions. Insufficient dissipation of heat in the case of exothermic reactions, as well as an insufficient supply of heat in the case of endothermic reactions, results in a heterogeneous temperature distribution within the reactor. Because it is very often the case in catalytic processes that different reactions take place at different temperatures, such a heterogeneous temperature distribution can lead to a loss of selectivity and the associated formation of undesirable secondary products. A temperature distribution that is as uniform as possible, ideally an isothermic reaction procedure, is therefore desirable. In that way the reactions can be controlled exactly and the<br><br>
formation of secondary products suppressed. An increase in the efficiency of the reaction procedure in the region of only a few tenths of a percent is generally associated with considerable economic advantages for the large industrial processes for which the reactors are used.<br>
In the case of the reactors described above, it is therefore known also to use cooled partitions made of metal plates, there being arranged in the metal partitions, for cooling purposes, cavities or interstices in the form of channels for holding and conducting a cooling medium. The catalyst particles are arranged between two such partitions. It has been found in such reactors that the catalyst particles lying loosely in the reaction chamber cannot be cooled sufficiently on account of the great distance from the cooling surface or the poor conduction of heat thereto. In that respect, a temperature gradient often becomes established in the reaction chamber, which in certain sub-regions results in undesirably heterogeneous temperature distribution.<br>
DE 101 08 380 describes a reactor for carrying out catalysed chemical reactions having a heat exchanger which has reaction chambers and heat transport chambers separated from one another by dimple plates. The catalyst is applied in the form of a thin layer to at least a portion of the surface of the dimple plates that faces the reaction chamber. The reactor described therein has, compared with conventional reactors equipped with individual catalyst particles, a significantly smaller surface area for heat exchange that is able to initiate a catalytic reaction with the reactants in respect of the stream of gas passing over it. In addition, the reactor described in that specification has the disadvantage that the catalyst is applied to the inner side of the dimple plates. This is disadvantageous especially when the catalysts are used for the preparation of acrylic acid from propene, because the carbon deposits inevitably formed in that reaction are difficult to remove from the interior of the dimple plates and, after prolonged operating periods, such deposits can clog the flow channels in the interior of the dimple plate.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the technical problems known from the prior art.<br><br>
A particular aim of the present invention is to provide a catalyst support body which ensures partial oxidation of propene and acrolein to acrolein and acrylic acid, respectively, with a high yield over a prolonged period.<br>
In addition, in accordance with a further aim, a process for the production of such catalyst support bodies is to be provided which is especially simple and economical to carry out and results in advantageous catalyst support bodies having a catalyst which, despite having a surface area that is as large as possible, exhibits good adhesion to the support body.<br>
A further aim of the present invention is to provide a reactor which is distinguished by low maintenance work and a homogeneous temperature distribution.<br>
Furthermore, in accordance with another aim, intensive contact between the reaction starting materials and the catalyst should be ensured in order thus to improve capacity and/or selectivity.<br>
A further aim is to provide an economical process, operating with a high conversion rate and high selectivity, for the preparation of organic molecules that contain at least one double bond, from which it is possible to prepare, without an excessive amount of working-up, water-absorbing polymers which can in turn be incorporated into hygiene articles.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a catalyst support body and a process that allow gas phase oxidation of an olefin that takes place under conditions which proceeds as closely as possible to the so-called explosion point occurring in corresponding gas phase oxidation.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide an efficient catalyst system which, in comparison with conventional tube reactors charged with powder catalyst, has fewer reactor stoppages associated with changing the catalyst.<br>
Those problems are solved by the main and subsidiary claims forming the respective categories. Further advantageous arrangements are described in the respective dependent patent claims which, in any desired combination with one<br><br>
another, may result in further advantageous arrangements.<br>
The catalyst support body according to the invention has a surface on which there is provided a coating bonded to the surface, the coating having fissures having a length, those lengths exhibiting a total fissure length of at least 500 m/m2 [metres per square metre] and the coating having an adhesive tensile strength of at least 500 N/m2 [Newtons per square metre].<br>
In accordance with another arrangement, the catalyst support body has a first thermal expansion coefficient and the coating has a second thermal expansion coefficient. The two thermal expansion coefficients differ, at least at a temperature in the range of from 20°C to 650°C, by at least 10 %. The difference is especially in the range of from 15 % to 95 %, preferably from 15 % to 50 %, further preferably from 15 % to 35 % and especially preferably in the range of from 15 to 25 %.<br>
It should be pointed out that it is in principle immaterial which of the two components (catalyst support body, coating) has the lower expansion coefficient, but it is preferred that the coating exhibits the lower thermal expansion coefficient.<br>
It should also be noted in this connection that the surface of the catalyst support body need not be totally covered by the coating, but it is advantageous for at least a portion of the surface bounding the reaction chamber, i.e. the outer surface (that is in contact with the environment), to be provided with such a coating. Although it is possible in principle for only spots, stripes or similar sub-regions (for example at least 50 %, or at least 70 %) to be coated, the arrangement having a totally coated, outer, surface is preferred.<br>
In respect of the thermal expansion coefficients it should be emphasised that the term refers especially to the longitudinal expansion coefficients. The longitudinal expansion coefficient a is the quotient of relative change in length ∆l/l1 and the change in temperature∆T; ∆l being the change in length with respect to the initial length of the body prior to the temperature change (l1) and the final length of the body after the temperature change (12X and ∆T being the temperature change<br><br>
(difference obtained from the temperature on measurement of the final length of the body and initial length of the body prior to the temperature change). This relationship is represented by the following formula:<br><br>
In order to take account of any irregularities in the material etc., it is assumed in the present case that the thermal expansion coefficients given here are each an average value in respect of the catalyst support body or the coating. In order to take greater account of this, it is also possible, however, for the thermal expansion coefficient to be related not only to a change in length but possibly also to a change in surface area (two-dimensional consideration of the surface) or possibly even to a change in volume. Particularly with respect to a catalyst support body composed of a plurality of components, it should also be pointed out that its expansion coefficient relates especially to the components or building elements that form the surface on which the coating is provided.<br>
It is stated that the two thermal expansion coefficients have the specified difference, at least at a temperature in the range of from 20°C to 650°C. Such a difference preferably applies over the entire temperature range; the difference should apply at least in a temperature range of from 200 to 500°C. The expansion coefficient is determined by measuring under a microscope, at a suitable temperature on a heated platform, the distance between points that are as far apart as possible on the corners and edges of the specimen body. In order to keep statistical variations to a minimum, ten or more measurements have proved suitable.<br>
It is desirable that the amount of difference is constant substantially over the entire temperature range (for example within a tolerance range of 5 %, especially 2 %), but this is not absolutely essential.<br>
When the temperature of the catalyst support body rises, the different thermal expansion coefficients have the effect that stresses arise in the coating or in the<br><br>
boundary layer between the catalyst support body and the coating. Preferably, the catalyst support body has the higher thermal expansion coefficient, that is to say it has the greater tendency to expand in the event of an increase in temperature. This greater tendency in comparison with the coating has the result that tensile stresses are transmitted to the coating. It is to be assumed below that the adhesive forces, that is to say the adhesion of the coating to the surface of the catalyst support body, are sufficiently great to lastingly prevent the coating from flaking off from the catalyst support body in later use under ambient conditions. In that case, the tensile stress is transmitted to inner regions of the coating. For the case where the coating is, for example, an unbroken surface, as has already been described with reference to the prior art, such tensile stress leads to the cohesive forces that obtain inside the coating being overcome, with the result that fissures, pores or similar structures are formed, in the interior or extending as far as the outer boundary layer of the coating. This may ultimately lead to a plurality of fissures being propagated through the coating, thus enlarging the outer surface of the coating that makes contact with, for example, reaction media flowing over it. Furthermore, as it were "expansion joints" are formed which, by becoming wider, in turn compensate for the different thermal expansion behaviour.<br>
These effects have the result that such catalyst support bodies are especially efficient in respect of the reaction of the reaction media. The fissures created firstly contribute to a jagged, enlarged contact surface, but at the same time also ensure that the catalyst support body has a long service life under alternating thermal stress. As a consequence, relatively little maintenance work has to be carried out, and production can proceed continuously over a long period.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous development of the catalyst support body, it is proposed that the coating has fissures having a length, the total fissure length being at least 500 m/m2 [metres per square metre]. The total fissure length is especially at least 1000 m/m2, preferably at least 2000 m/m2 and especially at least 4000 m/m2. In one arrangement according to the invention, a maximum total fissure length of up to 106 m/m2 and preferably up to 105 m/m2 is preferred.<br><br>
"Fissures" are especially to include those features in the coating which each have a length of at least 200 μ, especially at least 500 μ. It is assumed that such fissures involve an expansion of the material in a preferred direction of extension, that is to say it does not extend equally in all directions. The width of such fissures is usually at most 1/10 of the length of the fissure. The depth of a fissure, that is to say the extension in the direction of the thickness of the coating, depends substantially upon the thickness of the coating itself. It should be assumed here that a fissure is referred to when its depth is at least 80 %, especially at least 90 %, of the layer thickness. By grinding the catalyst layers, deeper layers are exposed and the fissure depth can be reproduced iteratively.<br>
Usually such a coating will not have a continuous fissure, but will instead have fissures that are distributed in some way and are each of different length. The "total fissure length" mentioned herein, that is to say the sum of all (individual) lengths of the fissures, relates to a unit surface area of 1 m x 1 m. To determine the total fissure length it is proposed that the coating in a working surface (of any dimensions) be viewed, for example, under a microscope. Images of such working surfaces can be measured and read out, for example, using image-processing software. The individual lengths of the fissures can be determined and added up automatically or manually, so that an absolute total fissure length is obtained. This absolute total fissure length is then related to a unit surface area of 1 m x 1 m in order to determine the relative total fissure length, mentioned herein. It will be clear that this is again a statistical average, so that in respect of a coating a plurality of small working surfaces may be measured and read out in order finally to obtain a more exact (absolute or relative) total fissure length. The total fissure length per unit surface area given herein provides a kind of specific fissure frequency. This characterises the extent to which the surface of the coating is enlarged during use, i.e. to what extent thermal stresses can be compensated by the fissures. The latter is advantageous particularly with a view to coatings which are not intended to form further fissures during use as a result of the different thermal expansion coefficients but in which the fissures are to be produced only during manufacture - during normal operation the cohesive forces that obtain in<br><br>
the coating are accordingly not exceeded.<br>
 In accordance with a further configuration of the catalyst support body, the coating has a layer thickness of at least 0.02 mm [millimetres]. The layer thickness is preferably in a range of from 0.1 mm to 3 mm, especially in a range of from 0.5 mm to 2 mm and furthermore preferably in a range of from 0.7 mm to 1.2 mm. The layer thicknesses mentioned herein are relatively thick also with respect to the materials of the catalyst support body used, but they are necessary, for example, for the provision of a sufficient catalytic surface in the case of partial oxidation of propene and acrolein to acrylic acid.<br>
In that respect, the combination of the above-mentioned (relative) total fissure length per unit cross-sectional surface area and the especially large layer thicknesses also has a surprising effect. Here the function of compensating the differing thermal expansion behaviour comes into increased effect. Accordingly, it is precisely in the case of large layer thicknesses that there is a high total fissure length. It should be added here, by way of explanation, that the layer thickness again relates to a value which is averaged over the entire coating. It relates to the spacing of the surface of the catalyst support body from the opposing boundary layer of the coating.<br>
It is also proposed that the coating have an adhesive tensile strength of at least 500 N/m2 [Newtons per square metre] and preferably at least 10,000 N/m2. The adhesive tensile strength is especially in a range of from 500 N/m to 100,000 N/m2, preferably in a range of from 1000 N/m2 to 25,000 N/m2. In general, the adhesive tensile strength is limited at the upper end by the stability of the catalyst.<br>
The adhesive tensile strength serves as a measure of the adhesive forces, that is to say the surface adhesion of the coating to the catalyst support body. The adhesive tensile strength is preferably greater than the cohesive forces that obtain in the interior of the coating.<br>
For determining the adhesive tensile strength, the following method, for example,<br><br>
is suitable: a die of predetermined dimensions is placed on a coating applied to a catalyst support body and joined thereto. The join can be made by mechanical anchoring, adhesive bonding, or in a similar manner. The die is then connected to a removal device which indicates the tensile force acting on the coating. The tensile force is then increased, stepwise or continuously, until substantial portions of the coating are torn free of the surface of the catalyst support body. The value so obtained represents the adhesive tensile strength in the present context.<br>
The adhesive tensile strength can be determined as follows: a cuboidal die having a base surface area A of 1 cm2 is fixed to the catalyst layer by means of a double-sided adhesive element of the same surface area A. By means of a spring balance, the force absorption under tension perpendicular to the layer is monitored. The maximum applied force F immediately before detachment of the catalyst layer from the support plate, less the weight G exerted by the die, gives the adhesive tensile strength (HZF) with HZF = (F-G)/A. If the adhesive element on the catalyst layer has a lower adhesive tensile strength than the layer on the support plate, only a lower boundary value can be indicated. Generally, however, the adhesive tensile strength of the catalyst layer in such a case is sufficient.<br>
In accordance with a further development of the catalyst support body, the coating is a catalytically active coating for partial oxidation of propene to acrolein and further to acrylic acid. Preferably it is a metal or salt of a metal, here especially a metal oxide. Preferred metals are transition metals and lanthanoids. Preference is given to the metals of sub-groups 5 and 6, with Mo, V, Nb and W being especially preferred and Mo, W and V being further preferred. In another configuration of a suitable catalyst, the catalyst contains Ni in addition to one or more of the above metals. In connection with suitable catalysts and conventional reactors, reaction conditions and purification methods for the preparation of acrolein and acrylic acid, reference is made to "Stets Geforscht", Vol. 2, Chemieforschung im Degussa-Forschungszentrum Wolfgang 1988, pages 108-126, chapter "Acrolein und Derivate", Dietrich Arntz and Ewald Noll, reference being made to the content thereof as part of this disclosure. The metals can be in oxide form, in pure form or in the form of mixtures, alloys or intermetallic phases.<br><br>
It is also proposed that the coating comprise, in addition to the catalyst, at least one inert and therefore non-catalytically acting constituent. The latter is preferably in X-ray-amorphous form, special preference being given to oxides of aluminium and of silicon.<br>
 It is also preferred according to the invention that the organic auxiliaries used in the coating are preferably water-soluble. They are especially incorporated into the coating prior to drying. This can be effected by bringing the auxiliaries into contact with the other constituents prior to the coating of the surface. For example, a slurry having the other constituents of the coating can be made as coating suspension with those auxiliaries by mixing and homogenisation. Polymeric substances are preferred as organic auxiliaries. Molecular weights (Mn) of more than 5000 g/mol, preferably more than 20,000 g/mol, and especially preferably more than 100,000 g/mol, have proved suitable. In turn, polysaccharides or derivatives thereof are preferred as polymers. Polysaccharides include the branched polysaccharides, especially cellulose and derivatives thereof. Deriva- '<br>
tives that come into consideration include especially oxygen derivatives, such as <br>
rs. Of those, cellulose ethers, such as Tylose , are especially prefe	rred.<br>
In accordance with a further configuration of the catalyst support body, the coating comprises at least one silicon- and oxygen-containing constituent. The silicon- and oxygen-containing constituent is preferably an Aerosil.<br>
In respect of the catalyst support body it is also proposed that it be constructed using metallic material. The metallic material preferably comprises at least one of the following elements: aluminium, iron, nickel. In principle, it should first be ascertained that the metallic material has particularly good properties in respect of heat conduction, that is to say rapid dissipation of heat or rapid supply of heat to the catalyst or the catalytically active coating is possible. In addition, the metallic material has the advantage that it has a high degree of shapeability. That means that application-specific parameters (for example the spatial conditions in any particular case) can easily be taken into account in the preparation of the catalyst support body and a certain degree of customisation for installation in a reactor is<br><br>
also possible. As a result of the conditions in the reaction chamber, it is advantageous for the catalyst support body to be resistant to high temperatures and corrosion-resistant. In that connection, it is advantageously proposed that the metallic material have a sufficient content of aluminium, iron and/or nickel. For example, the following steels are especially preferred: steel 1.4571 (V2A) having a a (20 to 400°C) of 18.5*10-6/K; 1.4401 having an a (20 to 400°C) of 11.5*10-6/K; 1.4903 having an a (20 to 400°C) of l4*l0-6/K; 1.4713 having an a (20 to 400°C) of 12*10-6/K; Ni alloys 2.4617 having an a (20 to 400°C) of 11.4*10-6/K; 2.4816 (Iconel® 600) having an a (20 to 400°C) of 14.5*1O-6/K; and also Ti alloys 3.7025 and 3.7035 having an a (20 to 400°C) of 9.3*10'6/K.<br>
Particularly in this context it is advantageous that the catalyst support body comprises a multi-walled sheet structure with at least one channel through which a substance is able to flow. In other words, such a multi-walled sheet structure is not only a simple heat exchange wall, but rather it is suitable, for example, for conveying the coolant in its interior. That means that preferably the entire surface which bounds the sheet structure towards the outside to the environment can be used for coating and accordingly also for promoting the chemical reactions that take place there.<br>
"Multi-walled" is to be understood as meaning, for example, a combination of two parallel sheets which have in the interior individual ribs, sleeves, guide surfaces, tubes etc. which on the one hand keep the two sheets spaced apart and on the other hand also divide the interior into flow channels or flow chambers. Such sheet structures are usually equipped with an inflow and an outflow, so that a coolant or heating medium can pass through. The coolant or heating medium, which is referred to herein generally as "substance", is usually gaseous or liquid. It is also possible, however, for such a substance to have gas or liquid components; the gaseous and/or liquid substances can also carry solids.<br>
The channel itself preferably allows free passage of substances, that is to say no additional materials are integrated therein. Because the same flow resistance should apply as far as possible over the entire cross-section of the sheet structure,<br><br>
in order to facilitate uniform dissipation of heat and a uniform supply of heat over the surface of the sheet structure, the use of additional materials or components in the interior of the channel is usually disadvantageous.<br>
In accordance with a preferred arrangement, the catalyst support body comprises a plurality of plates which form openings through which a fluid is able to flow. The term "openings" means especially passageways which can be seen in a cross-section through such a plate structure. Whereas, above, the sheet structure forms channels in which a partial flow of substance is conducted through the sheet structure independently of a further partial flow of substance, this need not necessarily be the case with the variant proposed here which comprises a plurality of plates having openings through which substance is able to flow. Rather, a plurality of cavities, which preferably communicate with one another (that is to say exchange flow with one another), can be provided between the plates.<br>
The plates form substantially planar sheets which may be provided with a texture. Such a texture is preferably of a height that is small in comparison with the length or width of the sheet, especially less than 10 %. Such texturing of the plates results in an enlargement of the surface area of the catalyst support body, so that at the same time more coating material can be applied. Examples of textures that have proved suitable are ribs, corrugations, lumps or the like.<br>
Such a catalyst support body is preferably in the form of a so-called "dimple plate". A "dimple plate" comprises metal plates which are welded together, forming connecting regions, at predetermined points or along predetermined lines, or are joined together by some other joint-forming technique, with flow channels being formed between the connecting regions. This is generally carried out, once the joins have been formed by joint-forming techniques, by subjecting the space between the metal plates to a pressure which results in plastic deformation of the regions of the metal sheets not joined to one another. There are thus formed cushion-like bulging portions which usually produce elliptical flow opening cross-sections. Such "dimple plates" are preferably self-supporting and allow the provision of a compact heat exchanger having a large heating surface area.<br><br>
When "dimple plates" are used as catalyst support bodies, in an embodiment of the catalyst support body according to the invention in which the coating has fissures having a total fissure length of at least 500 m/m2, the coating is applied not to the inner side of the cushion-like bulging portions but to the outer side of those bulging portions (variant A). The "outer side" of a dimple plate is to be understood as being that side of the dimple plate which has been given reference numeral 2 in Figure 1. In variant A, the coolant flows through the flow channels that are formed in the interior of the "dimple plate" by the welding together of the metal plates at predetermined points or along predetermined lines. In another embodiment of the catalyst support body according to the invention, when "dimple plates" are used, the coating is applied to the surface of the above-mentioned flow channels, so that in this case the coolant flows through the interstices of two adjacent "dimple plates" and accordingly along the outer surface of the cushion-like bulging portions of the "dimple plates" (variant B).<br>
When "dimple plates" are used as catalyst support bodies, variant A is especially preferred according to the invention.<br>
In accordance with a development, the catalyst support body is constructed using ceramic material. The ceramic material used for this purpose is preferably one which comprises at least one of the following elements: codierite, silicon carbide, aluminium oxide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide. A catalyst support body of ceramic material can be an alternative, for example, when relatively small catalyst support bodies are required, or when the catalyst support bodies can be simply produced in an extruding process. In addition, such ceramic catalyst support bodies offer the possibility of exploiting their inherent property of porosity and using the material of the catalyst support body for increasing the adhesive strength in respect of the coating or the effectiveness of the catalytically active coating. In principle, customised catalyst support bodies that comprise both metallic and ceramic material are also possible.<br>
A further contribution to solving the problems mentioned at the beginning is made by a catalyst support body having a surface on which a coating bonded to the<br><br>
surface is provided, the catalyst support body being a dimple plate and the coating being applied to the outer side of the dimple plate, the "outer side" of a dimple plate again being understood as the side of the dimple plate given reference numeral 2 in Figure 1. As the coating, preference is given to the coatings already mentioned above as being preferred, and here too special preference is given to a catalytically active coating for the partial oxidation of propene and acrolein. The layer thickness of the coating and its adhesive tensile strength also preferably correspond to the layer thicknesses and adhesive tensile strengths already mentioned above in connection with the coating of the catalyst support body.<br>
In a special embodiment of the catalyst support body described above, which comprises a dimple plate provided on the outside with a coating, the coating has fissures having a length, that length giving a total fissure length of at most 500 m/m2 [metres per square metre], especially at most 250 m/m2, more preferably at most 100 m/m2, more especially at most 10 m/m2 and furthermore more especially at most 1 m/m2, a coating without fissures being most preferred. The determination of the total fissure length is preferably effected in the way described at the beginning.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is proposed a reactor for the preparation of polymerisable monomers having at least one reaction chamber through which a fluid is able to flow, the at least one reaction chamber comprising at least one catalyst support body, as described above. The reaction chamber can be a column, a reservoir or some other, preferably sealable, space, which preferably withstands pressures in the range of from 1 to 50 bar, preferably in the range of from 2 to 40 bar and especially in the range of from 10 to 35 bar. Such reaction chambers preferably have a plurality of catalyst support bodies, which are especially arranged parallel to one another and accordingly define sub-volumes through which the reaction mixture is conducted. A reaction chamber for the preparation of polymerisable monomers, such as acrolein or acrylic acid, usually has at least two catalyst support bodies which are arranged next to one another. Preferably the individual catalyst support bodies are spaced substantially equal distances apart from one another. It is thus ensured that the dissipation and supply<br><br>
of heat is uniform over the entire reaction chamber and accordingly a homogeneous temperature distribution is obtained.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a process for the production of a coating on a surface of a catalyst support body is proposed which comprises at least the following steps:<br>
preparation of a solid/fluid phase with a catalyst suitable for the preparation of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, application of the solid/fluid phase to a catalyst support body, formation of a coating having fissures having a length, the total fissure length being at least 500 m/m2 [metres per square metre].<br>
The total fissure length per unit cross-sectional surface area is preferably at least 1000 m/m2, preferably 2000 m/m2, especially at least 4000 m/m2.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a process for the production of a coating on a dimple plate as catalyst support body is proposed which comprises at least the following steps:<br>
preparation of a solid/fluid phase with a catalyst suitable for the preparation of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, application of the solid/fluid phase to the outer side of the dimple plate, formation of a coating on the outer side of the dimple plate.<br>
In this case, the total fissure length in the coating per unit cross-sectional surface area is preferably at most 500 m/m2, especially at most 250 m/m2, more preferably at most 100 m/m2, further preferably at most 10 m/m2 and most preferably at most 1 m/m2 or there are no fissures.<br>
Preferred as solid/fluid phase is a slurry containing at least the catalyst and optionally also at least one of the above-described additives. It is in turn preferred that it contains one or more catalyst precursors from which the crude catalyst powder is obtained, or at least one crude catalyst powder or at least one catalyst precursor and at least one crude catalyst powder, as such or in the form of a slurry,<br><br>
in an amount in the range of from 10 to 90 % by weight, preferably from 30 to 80 % by weight and especially from 40 to 70 % by weight, in each case based on the solid/fluid phase. As fluid phase there comes into consideration any fluid phase known to a person skilled in the art as being suitable. Special preference is given to water, alcohols such as ethanol, acetone or hexane or mixtures of at least two thereof, with water or alcohols being especially preferred and water being further preferred.<br>
In accordance with the second process step, the solid/fluid phase is applied to a catalyst support body. The application comprises especially spray-application, vapour deposition, spreading, applique, adhesive bonding, sintering, or similar production methods. The catalyst can also be applied by the use of at least one of the following methods: CVD, PVD, sputtering, reactive sputtering, galvanic methods, or the like. It is also possible in principle for a plurality of the above-mentioned production methods to be used in combination with one another. It is also possible for the production methods to be carried out a number of times repeatedly or alternately. In some cases, it may also be advisable to carry out the application discontinuously, it being possible to observe rest periods or to carry out a thermal treatment between the individual application processes.<br>
Finally, a coating is generated that has fissures of the above-mentioned fissure frequency, i.e. of the mentioned total fissure length. In a case where the coating still does not have the necessary total fissure length after the second process step has been carried out once, it is proposed that the second step be repeated until the total fissure length indicated herein is achieved. Of particular assistance in this connection are combinations of thermal treatments of the catalyst support body or mechanical deformations of the catalyst support body having the coating, as explained in greater detail below.<br>
In accordance with a further configuration of the process, prior to the application of the solid/fluid phase the catalyst support body is subjected to adhesion-enhancing treatment. As already mentioned at the beginning, it is advantageous for the surface adhesion between the catalyst support body and the coating to be<br><br>
relatively high and long-lasting. It is therefore likewise advantageous for the surface of the catalyst support body to be so treated prior to the application of the solid/fluid phase that the formation of thermally and dynamically highly stressable bonds between the catalyst support body and the coating is promoted.<br>
In this connection, it is proposed especially that as "adhesion-enhancing" step (especially in respect of catalyst support bodies of metallic material), at least one of the following steps is carried out:<br>
a)	abrasive blasting of the surface,<br>
b)	machining of the surface,<br>
c)	cleaning of the surface,<br>
d)	thermal treatment of the surface.<br>
"Abrasive blasting" is to be understood in the present case as being blast-machining for the removal of material with the aid of abrasive agents which are blasted onto the surface being treated by means of energy carriers in a pressure or spinning process. The abrasive agent used (abrasively acting particles, for example) when pressure-blasting is transported and accelerated by liquid or gaseous energy carriers. Those processes are used especially for roughening or smoothing the surface, to effect a change in strength close to the surface or to bring about deformation of the surface. It is also possible for the abrasive blasting to fulfil several functions at the same time. Special preference is given in this case to abrasive blasting processes in which the surface is roughened. Sand-blasting may be mentioned here by way of example.<br>
"Machining" of the surface likewise involves treating the contours of the surface of the catalyst support body. Whereas, in abrasive blasting, the abrasive medium or the abrasive agent is "freely" brought into contact with the surface by means of liquid or gaseous energy carriers, in the "machining" process there is used a medium which has fixed cutting edges. This applies, for example, to certain abrasives in which the abrasives or the abrasive particles are firmly anchored to a reference surface (abrasive paper, grindstones, milling cutters). The use of such a<br><br>
method, on the one hand, allows the removal of impurities on the surface of the catalyst support body which impede bonding between coating and catalyst support body, and again also enables the contours, that is to say the surface finish, of the surface to be influenced in the desired way. In addition, it is preferred that the coating be bonded more strongly to the surface by adhesion-promoting structures located between the surface and the coating. Such structures are rod-shaped and preferably have barbs mat engage in the coating and are bonded to the surface. Such structures can be worked out of the surface or formed as an intermediate layer from a different material having better adhesion to the surface than the coating. A further possible way of enhancing the adhesiveness is galvanic treatment of the surface which, depending upon the currents applied, results in a roughening of the surface or in the above-mentioned rod-shaped structures.<br>
"Cleaning" of the surface means any process that is able to remove, for example, oil, solvent, dirt, oxides or similar impurities adhering to the surface. Washing or etching processes may be mentioned here by way of example.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible for the surface to undergo thermal treatment. It is thus possible to bring about structural changes in the material of the catalyst support body that have a positive effect on the bonding of the coating. At the same time, it is also possible in this way to keep away troublesome moisture or to carry out a calcining operation.<br>
In principle, any combination of the individual "adhesion-enhancing" methods is possible, at least the following combinations having already proved advantageous (the methods are indicated here only by the respective letters): a)+c); a)+c)+d); a)+d); b)+c); b)+c)+d); c)+d).<br>
In accordance with a development of the process, it is proposed that the application of the solid/fluid phase be effected at least in accordance with one of the following steps: spray-application, spreading, pouring, immersion. Preferably at least one of the steps is repeated at least once. In "spray-application", the solid/fluid phase is applied by means of a nozzle which effects preferably finely<br><br>
dispersed uniform distribution of the solid/fluid phase on the surface of the catalyst support body. In "spreading", the solid/fluid phase can be poured onto the surface and then distributed using a suitable tool, but it is also possible for the solid/fluid phase to be applied directly to the distributing device and to make contact with the surface of the catalyst support body in that way. In "pouring" the solid/fluid phase is simply poured onto the surface, the uniform distribution of the solid/fluid phase then being effected, if necessary, by suitable movement of the catalyst support body. Finally it is also possible for the solid/fluid phase to be held ready in a reservoir, for example, and the surface of the catalyst support body to be immersed therein. Such immersion is preferably effected with the catalyst support body at a temperature of more than 50°C, there thus being formed a crust of uniform thickness. A further possible method of applying the catalyst coating is screen printing. It is thereby possible for the fissure formation to be predetermined in respect of its spatial configuration by means of the structure of the screen and the mesh.<br>
In principle it is advantageous for the catalyst support body to be at a temperature other than room temperature during application, especially in a range of from 40°C to 800°C, preferably in a range of from 40°C to 500°C, and especially in a range of from 40°C to 250°C. Furthermore, it is advantageous for the catalyst support body to be moved relative to the source of the solid/fluid phase during application, so that the solid/fluid phase becomes uniformly distributed on the surface.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous development of the process, the catalyst support body is dried after application of the solid/fluid phase. This takes place especially at temperatures of from 20°C to 200°C, the drying operation preferably extending over a period of from 0.5 hour to 168 hours. The drying of the catalyst support body is very especially effected in an oxidising atmosphere or an inert atmosphere, optionally in vacuo. It is thus possible, for example, for the coating to dry slightly each time before the next application step begins. In that way, particularly high layer thicknesses can be achieved. They have, in addition, a<br><br>
relatively uniform layer thickness over the entire surface.<br>
In accordance with a development of the process, the coating is formed by calcining. The calcining is preferably effected at temperatures in a range of from 200°C to 1000°C, preferably in a range of from 210 to 600°C and especially in a range of from 350 to 550°C, for a period of from 0.5 hour to 24 hours, preferably a period of from 1 to 10 hours, and especially a period of from 1.1 to 5 hours. The calcining operation is optionally carried out in an oxidising atmosphere or an inert atmosphere. In order to achieve, for example, the desired total fissure length, it is advantageous to vary the temperature during the calcining operation, especially with a relatively high rate of temperature change. Those portions of the temperature sequence having a high rate of change are optionally followed by ageing periods in which the temperature is maintained level. Preferably there is finally a cooling step with a relatively high rate of cooling in order, in this case too, to promote the formation of fissures in the coating.<br>
In principle it is also possible to carry out the application and calcining operations a number of times. The applied coating or the applied coating that has already been subjected to thermal treatment may need to be treated (again) optionally with at least one "adhesion-enhancing" step, the coating preferably then having a surface with an average surface roughness of less than 0.2 mm.<br>
In accordance with a development of the process, the applied coating is brought into contact with at least one further solid/fluid phase for impregnation of catalytically active materials.<br>
It is also proposed that the impregnated coating be subjected to thermal treatment, it being especially advantageous for the impregnated coating to be calcined at temperatures of from 200°C to 1000°C for a period of from 1 hour to 24 hours.<br>
In accordance with a further configuration of the process it is proposed that the applied coating be reduced. This is preferably effected in a reducing atmosphere, preferably at temperatures in the range of from 50°C to 650°C for a period of from 0.5 hour to 24 hours.<br><br>
Also proposed is a process in which the catalyst support body is at least partially elastically deformed, so that fissures are formed in the coating. "Elastic" deformation is to be understood especially as meaning that it does not result in permanent deformation of the catalyst support body. This relates, for example, to bending stresses, the material of the catalyst support body not being stressed beyond its limit of elasticity. In some cases, however, it may also be advisable for subsequent customisation of the catalyst support body, including the coating, to be effected. Not only in this context it is also possible for the catalyst support body to be at least partially deformed "plastically", that is to say to acquire a permanent new form. The deformation (elastic and/or plastic) has in turn the result that stresses, especially tensile stresses, develop in the catalyst support body and the coating, which promote fissure formation in respect of the coating.<br>
As a further aspect there is proposed a process for the preparation of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, in which process an organic molecule containing at least one double bond is brought into contact with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst support body according to the invention. Molecules having double bonds include especially α -olefins. Of those, propylene is especially preferred.<br>
It is also proposed that, for the preparation of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, an organic molecule containing at least one double bond is brought into contact with oxygen in at least one reactor of the kind described above.<br>
Also proposed is a process for the production of a water-adsorbing polymer wherein an acrylic acid, obtainable from the process according to the invention in the form of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond, is polymerised.<br>
With a view to a process for the production of a water-adsorbing hygiene article it is proposed that a water-adsorbing polymer, preferably a superabsorber, which has been prepared in accordance with the above process, is incorporated into at least<br><br>
one hygiene article constituent. Such a hygiene article constituent is especially the core of a nappy/diaper or sanitary towel. Superabsorbers are water-insoluble, cross-linked polymers which are able to absorb large amounts of water, aqueous fluids, especially body fluids, more especially urine or blood, with swelling and the formation of hydrogels, and to retain such fluids under pressure. Super-absorbers absorb especially at least 100 times their own weight in water. Further details relating to superabsorbers are disclosed in "Modern Superabsorbent Polymer Tecnology", F.L. Buchholz, A.T. Graham, Wiley-VCH, 1998. By virtue of those characteristic properties, such water-absorbing polymers are incorporated chiefly into sanitary articles, such as, for example, baby's nappies/diapers, incontinence products or sanitary towels.<br>
Also proposed are fibres, moulded articles, films, foams, super-absorbing polymers, detergents, special polymers for the fields of wastewater treatment, disperse dyes, cosmetics, textiles, leather finishing or paper manufacture, and hygiene articles, which are at least based on, or contain, an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, preferably (meth)acrylic acid, which are obtainable in accordance with the above-mentioned process.<br>
Finally, there is also proposed the use of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, preferably (meth)acrylic acid, especially acrylic acid, obtainable in accordance with the process of the invention for the preparation of an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen, in or for the production of fibres, moulded articles, films, foams, super-absorbing polymers or hygiene articles, detergents or special polymers for the fields of wastewater treatment, disperse dyes, cosmetics, textiles, leather finishing or paper manufacture.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail below with reference to the Figures. The Figures show especially preferred exemplary embodiments, but the invention is not limited thereto.<br>

Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic view of a detail of a further variant of the catalyst support body.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic, perspective view of a catalyst support body 1 which is in the form of a multi-walled sheet structure 8. A coating 3 has been applied to the surface 2 of the catalyst support body 1, which coating 3 has a plurality of fissures 4. The sheet structure 8 comprises two sheets which are joined to one another in predetermined connecting regions 18. As a result, between the connecting regions 18 there is formed at least one channel 9, preferably a plurality of channels 9, arranged substantially parallel to one another. While the surface 2 and the coating 3 are in contact with the reaction media (especially oxygen and an organic molecule containing at least one double bond), the channels 9 serve for guiding a stream of coolant 15 which establishes a desired temperature level in respect of the catalytically motivated reaction. In the variant shown, a regular structure has been chosen for the sheet structure 8, the neighbouring channels 9, which have no transverse connection with one another, being spaced equal distances 24 apart from one another. This is not absolutely essential, however.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a diagrammatic view of a detail of a further exemplary embodiment of a catalyst support body 1 according to the invention. The catalyst support body 1 shown comprises a plurality of plates 10, which form openings 11 through which a fluid is able to flow. While the catalyst support body 1 according to Fig. 1 comprises channels 9 that are separate from one another, here a plurality of inter-<br><br>
connected cavities is provided which allow intermixing of the stream of coolant 15 running between the plates 10. The plates 10 are joined to one another in specific, here point-form, connecting regions 18, forming pillow-shaped cavities or openings 10, so that a so-called "dimple plate" is formed (as also in Fig. 1). The catalyst support body 1, which here is in the form of a dimple plate 17, facilitates uniform flow of the stream of coolant 15 in the interior of the dimple plate 17, as shown by the dotted arrows. The coating 3 is provided on the surface 2 of the catalyst support body 1, the stream of gas 21 comprising the reactants being conveyed over the coating 3 in a direction as far as possible transverse to the stream of coolant 15 (principle: "cross-flow" and/or "counter-flow heat exchanger"). It is thus possible to achieve an especially uniform temperature level over the entire surface 2.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view of a detail of a reactor 25 having a reaction chamber 12 which is bounded by a wall 16. The wall 16 fixes a plurality of dimple plates 17 which are arranged regularly spaced 23 apart from one another. The dimple plates 17 in turn form openings 11 through which the stream of coolant 15 is able to flow (as indicated). The stream of gas 21, which comprises the oxygen and an organic molecule containing at least one double bond, is conducted over the coating 3 of the dimple plates 17 as far as possible traverse thereto, thus promoting the exothermic reaction. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the connecting regions 18 of the dimple plates 17 are so arranged that the cushion-shaped openings 11 lie substantially in a plane 22. It is also possible, however, for the openings 11 or the connecting regions 18 to be so arranged that the openings 11 of neighbouring dimple plates 17 are positioned offset with respect to one another, for example in order to achieve a constant spacing 23 over the entire surface 2. The spacings range preferably from 50 μm to 1.5 cm, especially from 500 μm to 5 mm, and more especially from 750 μm to 2 mm.<br>
Fig. 4 shows, in diagrammatic form, a photograph of a coating 3 having fissures 4 produced in Example 2. The fissures 4 each have a length 5. To determine the total fissure length, the individual lengths 5 of the fissures 4 in such a photograph are added up, the absolute total fissure length obtained therefrom being related to<br><br>
the reference surface area of one square metre. In the photograph shown in Fig. 4, the fissures are relatively long and in some instances are joined together.<br>
The slurry was applied to a catalyst support body which corresponds substantially to the structure from Fig. 2.<br>
In this case, the surface area under observation was 32 mm2. In that portion of the image, the fissures were measured by tracing the fissures and adding up. Adding up the fissure lengths in that portion of the image gave an absolute total fissure length of 27,512 μm. When related to a unit surface area of 1 m2, that corresponds<br>
to a (relative) total fissure length of 848 1<br>
m<br>
Fig. 5 likewise shows, in diagrammatic form, a photograph of a further coating 3 in accordance with Example 3 having fissures 4. The fissures 4 shown are noticeably shorter, but in this case the number of fissures 4 is significantly higher than in Fig. 4.<br>
The photograph in Fig. 5 shows a portion of a coating 3.<br>
A slightly different magnification was selected for the photograph shown in Fig. 5 because the fissures 4 in this case are of shorter length 5. The two scales used in Figs. 4 and 5 can be compared by way of the reference length of 500 μm. The measured surface area in Fig. 5 is 9. mm2. The absolute total fissure length obtained was a value of 24,596 μm. That is to say, in other words, that the<br>
(relative) total fissure length is 2,515 1.<br>
m<br>
Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic view of a detail of a variant of a catalyst support body 1, which shows a portion of a plate 10, the surface 2 of which is provided with a coating 3. The coating 3 has a plurality of fissures 4 which have a width 19 and extend over at least 80 % of the layer height 6. The coating 3 comprises, in addition, various constituents 7 which inter alia promote a catalytic reaction between an organic molecule containing at least one double bond and oxygen. The plate 10 here has a sheet thickness 14 in the region of from 100 μm to 50 mm.<br><br>
On the side of the plate 10 remote from the coating 3 there is arranged the coolant 20 which may flow along the inner side of the plate 10 and accordingly ensure uniform dissipation of the heat generated by the catalytic reaction.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail with reference to non-limiting Examples:<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
1.	Preparation of the crude catalyst powder.<br>
In accordance with DE-OS 16 18 744, as precursor 424 g of ammonium para-molybdate, 47 g of ammonium metavanadate and 27 g of ammonium para-tungstate were dissolved separately in distilled water, the resulting solutions were mixed and 236 g of silica sol were added to the mixture. The resulting slurry was dried and the solid cake was pulverised by grinding in a ball mill in order to obtain the crude catalyst powder.<br>
2.	Comparison Example of a coating (Fig. 4)<br>
100 g of crude catalyst powder and 5 g of Aerosil® (Degussa AG, Germany) were mixed together and homogenised with 120 g of totally deionised water, with stirring, and then poured onto the face to be coated of a steel sheet (1.457 according to DIN EN 10 027; sheet thickness 0.5 mm, surface area 50 * 300 mm). The face is surrounded by lateral boundaries having a height of 1 mm measured from the surface of the face, so that the height of the boundary determines the maximum coating thickness. The face was degreased prior to coating and then sand-blasted. Coating dispersion projecting above the lateral boundaries was removed in order to obtain a uniform layer thickness of 1 mm. After drying at room temperature, calcining was carried out. For this purpose, heating was carried out at a rate of 120 K/min to 550°C, then at a rate of 2 K/min to 570°C. That temperature was maintained for 30 minutes and then cooling was carried out at a cooling rate of 5 K/min for 10 minutes and then at an exponentially decelerating cooling rate to room temperature. The adhesion was less than 10 N/m2 .<br><br>
3. Coating according to the invention (Fig. 4)<br>
For this purpose, the above Example was followed, with 0.5 g of Tylose® (cellulose ether) being additionally used for the preparation of the coating suspension. The adhesion was 500 N/m2.<br><br><br>
