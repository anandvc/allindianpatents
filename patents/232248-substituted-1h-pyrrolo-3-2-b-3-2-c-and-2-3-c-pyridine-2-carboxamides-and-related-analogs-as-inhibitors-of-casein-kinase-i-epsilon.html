Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>

2.	Description of the Art<br>
Rhythmic variations in behavior are displayed by many organisms, ranging from single cells to man. When the rhythm persists under constant conditions, and has a period of about one day, depending little on temperature, the rhythm is called "circadian" (Konopka, RJ. and Benzer, S. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68,2112-2116).<br>
Circadian rhythms are generated by endogenous biological pacemakers (circadian clocks) and are present in most living organisms including humans, fungi, insects and bacteria (Dunlap, J.C. (1999) Cell 96,271-290; Hastings, J.W. et al. Circadian Rhythms, The Physiology of Biological Timing. In: Prosser, CX. ed. Neural and Integrative Animal Physiology, New York: Wiley-Iiss (1991) 435-546; Allada, R. et al. (1998) Cell 93,791-804; Kondo et al. (1994) Science 266,1233-1236; Crosthwaite, S.K et al. (1997) Science 276, 763-769; Shearman, LP. et al. (1997) Neuron, 19,1261-1269). Circadian rhythms are self-sustaining and constant even under conditions of total darkness, but can be synchronized (entrained) to a new day/night regime by environmental signals such as light and temperature cycles (Pittendrigh, C.S. (1993) Annu. Rev. Physiol., 55,16-54; Takahashi, J.S. (1995) Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 18, 531-553; Albrecht, U. et al. (1997) Cell, 91,1055-1064). Circadian clocks<br><br>
are essential for maintaining biological ihythms and regulate a variety of circadian behaviors such as daily fluctuations in behavior, food intake and the sleep/wake cycle, as well as physiological changes such as hormone secretion and fluctuations in body temperature (Hastings, M. (1997) Trends Neurosci. 20,459-464; Reppert, S.M. and Weaver, D JL (1997) Cell 89,487-490).<br>
Genetic and molecular studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster led to elucidation of some of the genes involved in circadian rhythmicity. These studies led to recognition of a pathway that is closely auto-regulated and comprised of a transcription/translation-based negative feed back loop (Dunlap, J.C. (1999) Cell, 96,271-290; Dunlap, J.C. (1996) Annu, Rev. Genet 30,579-601; Hall, J.C. (1996) Neuron, 17,799-802). The core elements of the circadian oscillator in Drosaphila consists of two stimulatory proteins dCLOCK/dBMAL (CYCLE) and two inhibitory proteins dPERIOD (dPER) and dTTMELESS (dTIM). dCLOCK and dBMAL heterodimerize forming the transcription factor dCLOCK/dBMAL that promotes expression of two genes termed DrosopMla Period (dper) and Drosophila Timeless (dtim). Ultimately the mRNAs from these genes are transcribed to afford the proteins dPER and dTIM, respectively. For several hours the protein products dPER and dTIM are synthesized and phosphorylated in the cytoplasm* reach a critical level, and form heterodimers that are translocated into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus dPER and dTIM function as negative regulators of their own transcription, accumulation of dPER and cOTM declines, and activation of dper and dtim by ddXXX/dBMAL starts again (Zylka, M J. et al. (1998) Neuron 20,1103-1110; Lowrey, PJL et aL (2000) 288,483-491). The dper gene has been shown to be a necessary element in controllingfircadian rhythms in adult eclosion (the emergence of the adult fly from the pupa) behavior and locomotor activity (Konopka, RJL, &amp; Benzer, S. (1971) Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA, 68,2112-2116). Missense mutations of the per gene can either shorten (per^) or lengthen (per**) the period of circadian rhythms, while nonsense mutations (per*) cause anhythmicity in their behaviors (Hall, J.C. (1995) Trends Neurosci. 18,230-240).<br>
In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus are the site of a master biological clock (for review see Panda et al7 (2002) Nature 417,329 - 335; Reppert, S.M- and Weaver, DJR.. (1997) Cell, 89,487-490). The SCN clock is entrained to the 24 hour day by the daily light-dark cycle, with light acting through both direct and indirect retinar-to-SCN pathways (Klein, D.C. et al. (1991) Suprachiasmatic Nuclei: The Mind's Clock, Oxford Univeristy Press, New York). In the SCN of rodents, three Per genes have been<br><br>
identified and cloned, and are designated as mouse Perl {piPerl\ mPer2 and mPer3~ The protein products of these mammalian genes (mPERl, mPER2, mPER3) share several regions of homology to each other, and each mammalian Per gene encodes a protein with a protein dimerization domain designated as PAS (PAS is an acronym for the first three proteins PER, ARNT and SIM found to share this functionally important dimerizalion domain) that is highly homologous to the PAS domain of insect PER. All Per messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and protein levels oscillate during the circadian day and are intimately involved in both positive and negative regulation of the biological clock, but only mPERl and mPER2 oscillate in response to light (ZyBca, MJ. et aL (1998) Neuron 20,1103-1110.; Albrecht, U. et aL, (1997) Cell 91,1055-1064; Shearman, LJE\ et aL (1997) Neuron 19,1261-1269). Hie mammalian homolog of the Drosophila tint gene was cloned and designated as mTinu However, there was no evidence for mPER-mTTML interactions analogous to those observed in Drosophila, and it was suggested that PER-PER interactions may have replaced the function of PER-HM dimers in the molecular workings of the mammalian circadian clock (Zylka, MJ. et aL, (1998) Neuron 21,1115-1122). Another possibility is that rhythms in PERI and PER2 form negative feedback loops that regulate the transcriptional activity of the Clock protein (via their PAS domains), which, in turn, drives expression of either or both Per genes (Shearman, UP. et aL (1997) Neuron 19,1261-1269).<br>
Understanding the roles of the three mPer genes in the nriflTmnaiifln clockwork has been the subject of much investigation. The structural homology of the mPER proteins to dPER led to the expectation that the mPER proteins would function as negative elements in the mammalian feedback loop. PERI is believed to be involved in the negative regulation of its own transcription in the feedback loop, but recent evidence points to it being involved in the input pathway (Hastings, M.H. et aL (1999) Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA 26,15211-15216). PER2 is the most well characterized protein, and mPER2 mutant miae (mPer2Brdnt2)9 lacking 87 residues at the carboxyl portion of the PAS dimerization domain, have a shortened circadian cycle in normal light-dark settings, but show anhythmicity in complete darkness. TTie mutation also diminishes the oscillating expression of both mPerl and rhPerl in the SCN, indicating that mPer2 may regulate niPerl in vivo (Zheng, B. et aL (1999) Nature 400,169-173). PER2 has been shown to have a dual function in the regulation of the "gears" of the central clock (Shearman, UP. et aL (2000) Science 288,1013-1018). In that study, PER2 was shown to bind to cryptochrome (CRY) proteins and translocate to the nucleus where CRY negatively regulated transcription driven by the CLOCK and BMAL1 positive transcriptional<br><br>
complexes. Upon nuclear entry, PER2 initiated the positive aim of the clock by positively regulating BMAL1 transcription by a yet unidentified mechanism. The function of PER3 is poorly understood; however, in ?nPer3 knockout mice a subtle effect on circadian activity is observed, and therefore PER3 has been suggested to be involved in the circadian controlled output pathways (Shearman, L.P. et al. (2000) MoL Cell. Biol. 17,6269-6275). It has been reported that mPER proteins interact with each other and that mPER3 can serve as a carrier of mPERl and mPER2 to bring them into the nucleus which is critical for the generation of circadian signals in the SCN (Kume, K. et al. (1999) Cell 98,193-205; Takano, A. et al. (2000), EEBS Letters, 477,106-112).<br>
Phosphorylation of the components of the circadian clock has been postulated to regulate the duration of the cycle. The first genetic evidence that a specific protein kinase regulates the Drosophila circadian rhythm was the discovery of the novel gene doubletime (dbt), encoding a protein serine/threonine kinase (Price JJL et al. (1998) Cell 94, 83-95; Kloss B. et al. (1998) Cell 94, 97-107). Missense mutations in the dbt result in an altered circadian rhythm. Null alleles of dbt result in hypophosphorylation of dPER and arrhythmia.<br>
The mammalian kinases most closely related to DBT are casein kinase Ie (CKie) and casein kinase 15 (CKI5). Both kinases have been shown to bind to mFERl, and several studies have shown that CKfe phosphorylates both mouse and human PERI (Price JJL et al. (1998) Cell 94, 83-95; Kloss B. et al. (1998) Cell 94, 97-107). In a study with human embryonic kidney 293T cells co-transfected with wild-type hCKfe, hPERl showed a significant increase in phosphorylation (evidenced by a shift in molecular mass). In this study, the phosphorylated hPERl had a half-life of approximately twelve hours whereas unphosphorylated hPERl remained stable in the cell for more that 24 hours, suggesting phosphorylation of hPERl leads to a decrease in protein stability (Kessler, G.A. et al. (2000) NeuroReport, 11,951-955). Another study also showed the consequence of PERI phosphorylation by hCKIe includes both cytoplasmic retention, nuclear translocation, and protein instability (Vielhaber, R et al. (2000) MoL Cell. Biol. 13,4888-4899; Takano, A. et al. (2000) EEBS Letters 477,106-112).<br>
There has been no biochemical reason to choose between CKfe or CKE5 as a potential regulator in mammals until Lowery et al. [(2000) Science 288,483-491] found that in the Syrian Golden hamster, semidominant mutations in CKfe (tau mutation, Ralph, M.R. and Menaker, M. (1988) Science 241,1225-1227) caused a shortened circadian day in both heterozygous (22 h) and homozygous animals (20 h). In this instance, reduced levels of CKIe<br><br>
activity resulted in less PER phosphorylation with presumably higher levels of cytoplasmic PER protein leading to enhanced nuclear entry and altered circadian cycles. More recently, it has been suggested that CKI5 may also be involved in regulating circadian rhythmicity by post-translation modification of mammalian clock proteins hPERl and hPER2 [Camacho, F. et al., (2001) EEBS Letters 489(2,3), 159-165]. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of CKIe and/or CKI8 provide a novel means to alter circadian rhythm. As discussed below, the ~ alteration of circadian rhythm may find utility for the treatment of sleep or mood disorders.<br>
U.S. patent 6,555328 Bl discloses screening methods in cells to identify compounds that alter circadian rhythms based on a test compound altering the ability of human casein kinase le and/or human casein kinase 15 to phosphorylate the human clock proteins hPERl, hPER2 and hPER3. For example, HEK293T cells are co-transfected with hCKIe and Perl or Per2. For the purpose of evaluating the relevancy of CKIe inhibition and CKfe inhibitors to circadian biology, a hi^i-throughput cellular assay (33rd Annual Meeting, Soc. for Neurosci., November 8-12,2003, Abstract numbers 284.1,284.2, and 284.3) was developed in which circadian rhythm could be monitored in a routine manner. The assay consists of Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing an Mperl-luc construct, thus enabling the determination of the rhythmic activation of the Mperl promoter in living cells by repeatedly estimating luciferase activity by monitoring light-output over several days. The repeated measure format of the assay permits accurate and reproducible assessment of the concentration-dependent effects of CKIe inhibitors on circadian rhythm and provides the nexus for relating CKIe inhibition to circadian period alteration.<br>
Sleep disorders have been classified into four major categories that include primary sleep disorders (dyssomnias and parasomnias), sleep disorders associated with medical/psychiatric disorders and a category of proposed sleep disorders for sleep disorders that cannot be classified due to insufficient data. Primary sleep disorders are thought to arise from abnormalities in the intrinsic systems responsible for sleep-wake generation (homeostatic system) or timing (circadian system). Dyssomnias are disorders in initiating or maintaining sleep and include primary insomnia, hypersorania (excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, circadian Aythm sleep disorder, and dyssomnias not otherwise specified. Primary insomnia is characterized by the persistence (&gt;1 month) in difficulty of initiating and maintaining sleep or of non-restorative sleep. Difficulties in sleeping associated with primary insomnia leads to significant distress or impairment, including daytime irritability, loss of attention and concentration, fatigue and malaise, and<br><br>
deterioration of mood and motivation. Orcadian ihytfam sleep disorders include jet lag syndrome, shift work sleep disorder, advanced sleep phase syndrome and delayed sleep phase syndrome (J. Wagner, MX. Wagner and W.A. Hening, Annals of Phaimacotherapy (1998) 32, 680-691). Individuals in a forced sleep paradigm demonstrate a greater wakefulness, as a percentage of sleep time, at certain periods of circadian day (Dijk and Lockley, J. Appl. PhysioL (2002) 92, 852-862). It has been generally accepted that with age there is an advance in our circadian rhythm for sleep and often results in less quality sleep (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. (2002) 282, E297-E303). Thus, sleep occurring out of circadian phase may suffer in qualitative and quantitative terms, as further exemplified by alterations in sleep with shift work and jet lag. Disturbance of the human circadian clock can cause sleep disorders and agents that modulate circadian rhythmicity, such as an inhibitor of CKIe and/or CKI8, may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders, and particularly circadian rhythm sleep disorders.<br>
Mood disorders are divided into depressive disorders ("unipolar depression"), bipolar disorders, and two disorders based on etiology that include mood disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced mood disorder. Depressive disorders are subclassified as major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Bipolar disorders are subclassified as bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. It has been observed that the specifier "seasonal pattern" can be applied to major depressive disorders that are recurrent and to the patten of major depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. Prominent anergy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates often characterize major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in major depressive disorder that is recurrent or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar disorders, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season. The winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes, younger persons are at higher risk for winter depressive episodes, and females comprise 60% to 90% of persons with seasonal patten. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a term commonly used in the literature, is a subtype of mood disorder that in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association: "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000) is<br><br>
denoted by the term "with seasonal pattern" when describing a seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder or recurrent major depressive disorder (E. M. Tarn et aL, Can. J. Psychiatry (1995) 40,457-466). The characteristics and diagnoses of depressive disorders, major depressive disorder, major depressive episode, bipolar I disorder, bipolar E disorder and seasonal effects are described in DSM-IV.<br>
Patients suffering from major depressive disorders, including SAD that is characterized by recurrent depressive episodes typically in winter, have been shown to be positively responsive to light therapy (Kripke, Journal of Affective Disorders (1998) 49(2), 109-117). The success of bright light treatment for patients with SAD and major depression resulted in the proposal of several hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanism of action for the therapeutic effect of ligfat These hypotheses included the "circadian rhythm hypothesis" that suggests the antidepressant effect of bright light could be associated with phase-shifting the circadian pacemaker relative to sleep (E. M. Tarn et aL, Can. J. Psychiatry (1995) 40,457-466). In support of the link between light therapy and circadian rhythm, clinically effective light therapy in major depressive disorders causes a concomitant shift in circadian phase and the clinical effectiveness of light therapy appears to depend on the phase-shifting ability of the light therapy (Czeisler et aL, The Journal of Physiology (2000) 526 (Part 3), 683-694; Tennan et aL, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry (2001) 58,69-75). Additionally, light-therapy has been shown to accelerate and augment the effectiveness of the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorders (Benedetti et aL, J- Clin. Psychiatry (2003) 64,648-653). Thus, inhibition of casein Mnase Is and/or casein kinase 15 would be expected to cause a circadian phase shift and such inhibition represents a potential clinically effective mono- or combined therapy for mood disorders.<br>
It should be noted that sleep disturbance is a criterion symptom for many psychiatric disorders (W.V. McCaU, J. din. Psychiatry (2001) 62 (suppl 10), 27-32). Sleep disturbances are a common feature of depressive disorders and insomnia is the sleep disturbance that is frequently reported in depression, occurring in over 90% of depressed patients (ME. Thase, J. Clin. Psychiatry (1999) 60 (suppl 17), 28-31). Accumulating evidence supports a common pathogenesis for primary insomnia and major depressive disorder. It has been hypothesized that corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) hyperactivity (due to genetic predisposition or possibly early stress) and stress induce a process leading to exaggerated and protracted sleep disturbances, and eventually primary insomnia. Circadian rhythmicity in CRF secretion under nonstressed conditions may play a role in the normal sleep-wake expression (G.S. Richardson<br><br>
and T. Roth, J. Clin Psychiatry (2001) 62 (suppl 10), 39-45). Thus, agents that modulate circadian rhythmicity, for example by inhibition of casern kinase Is and/or casein kinase 15, may be useful for treatment of depressive disorders due to effects on CRF secretion.<br>

As used herein, 'stereoisomef is a general term used for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. The term stereoisomer includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), mixtures of mirror image isomers (racemates, racemic mixtures), geometric (cis/trans orE/Z) isomers, and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers).<br>
As used herein, R1 and'S1 are used as commonly used in organic chemistry to denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term "R1 (rectus) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The term fSf (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise relationship of group priorities<br><br>
(highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon sequence rules wherein prioritization is first based on atomic number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A listing and discussion of priorities is contained in Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, Ernest L. Eliel, Samuel H. Wilen and Lewis N. Mander, editors, Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1994.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by processes analogous to those known in the art Reaction schemes 1, 2 and 3, and the corresponding descriptive text, describe the preparation of the various compounds of the invention. The disclosed methods and examples are provided for illustration purposes and in no way limit the scope of the present invention. Alternative reagents, reaction conditions, and other combinations and permutations of the steps herein described to arrive at individual compounds are readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art Tables 1,2 and 3 provide summaries of the example compounds, and biological data for example compounds of the invention is summarized in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1 discloses a synthesis for the compounds of this invention from commercially available 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine (la-1 wherein K is N and L and M are each C), 3-chloro-4-nitropyridine (lb-1 wherein L is N and K and M are each C) or 4-chloro-3-nitropyridine (lc-1 wherein M is N and K and L are each C), or an optionally substituted chloro-nitropyridine 1. The first digit of a compound number pertains to the corresponding compound or structure number as shown in any of Schemes 1-3, for example, the first digit 1 in la-1 pertains to compound or structure 1 in Scheme 1,. The subsequent letter designation "a", "b" or "c" identifies a compound as a precursor for, or member of, the lH-pynx&gt;lo[3,2-b]pyridine-2-carboxamide series ("a", also known as 4-azaindole series), the lH-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine-2-carboxamide series ("b", also known as the 5-azaindole series) and the lH-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-2-carboxannde series (**c*\ also known as the 6-azaindole series), respectively.<br><br>
The final digit or digits following the dash in a compound number identifies the specific compound in that structure series. Where a compound is only identified by a number, the number refers to the corresponding compound or structure as shown in any of Schemes 1-3, and it is understood that the discussion generically includes the three structural series as identified by "a", *"brt and "c" as discussed above.<br>
In Scheme 1, step a, chloro-nitropyridine 1 is added in portions to an alkali metal salt of a malonic acid diester in excess malonic diester, such as for example the sodium, potassium or lithium salt of the malonic acid diester in an excess of the malonic acid diester, such as for example diethyl malonate or dimethyl malonate, at a temperature of about 50 °C to about 70°C. The alkali metal salt of the malonic acid diester may be prepared, for example, by adding an alkali metal, such as for example sodium metal, to an excess of the malonic acid diester as is well known to one skilled in the art After about three hours at about 50 °C to about 70°C, the mixture is allowed to stand at ambient temperature for about 12 to about 24 hours. If the reaction is incomplete, the mixture is heated to about 80°C for about 2 hours to about 4 hours, then concentrated to remove excess malonic acid diester, and then treated with a concentrated mineral acid such as for example hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid and water. The mixture is heated at about 100 °C to about 110°C for about 5 hours to about 9 hours to effect decarboxylation. After standing about 12 to about 24 hours at ambient temperature the mixture is washed with a suitable solvent, such as for example ethyl ether and ethyl acetate, basified to about pH 8 to about pH 9 with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as for example sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and extracted with a suitable organic solvent, such as for example ethyl acetate. The organic extract is filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the desired methyl-nitropyridine 2. Preparation of 2 by this "step a" procedure is referred to as a "two step, one pot synthesis".<br>
Alternatively, in Scheme 1, step a, methyl-nitropyridine 2 may be prepared by Suzuki coupling of 1 with methylboronic add. Thus, a mixture of chloro-nitropyridine 1, methylboronic acid, potassium carbonate and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)paIladium(0) [PdOPPh3&gt;43 in a suitable aprotic solvent, such as for example dioxane, is heated at about 110 °C to about 120°C for about 12 hours to about 16 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, concentrated and purified by chromatography to provide methyl-nitropyridine 2.<br>
Advantageously it has now been found that compound 2 can also be prepared in one pot involving two steps in accordance with Scheme 1, step a. Accordingly, one adds to a<br><br>
polar solvent, such as for example dimethylformamide or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, from about 2 to about 2.5 equivalents of a base, such as for example potassium t-butoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydride, sodium t-butoxide, or sodium hexamethyldisilazide, at temperature of about 16°C and with stirring for about 30 minutes. The mixture is then treated with about one to about four equivalents of a malonic acid diester, such as for example diethyl malonate, at a temperature of about 20°C to about 35°C. After about 20 minutes, the mixture is treated at about 29°C to about 44°C with a solution of about one equivalent of compound 1 and a polar solvent such as for example dimethylformamide or N-methylpynolidone. The mixture is heated to about 50°C until the reaction is complete as indicated by HPLC analysis or other chromatographic analysis as is well known to one skilled in the art. Most advantageously, compound 1 is condensed with about 2.0 equivalents of diethyl malonate wherein N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone is the preferred solvent, wherein about 2.2 to about 2.5 equivalents of sodium t-butoxide is the preferred base, and wherein the above described order of additions, reaction temperatures and times are employed for this portion of the more advantageous "one pot, two step" (step a) synthesis of compound 2. When the reaction is complete, the mixture is treated with a mineral acid and water, preferably about 4.2 equivalents of 6M sulfuric acid, at about 100°C for about 12 hours to effect decaiboxylation. The reaction is quenched with ice water and extracted with a suitable solvent such as toluene to afford compound 2. The synthesis of compound 2a-l (2-methyl-3-nitro-pyridine) by this advantageous "step a" procedure resulted in a surprisingly significant reduction in reaction time (about 2 hours versus about 3 days) for the condensation of la-1 with diethyl malonate, and provided 2a-l in significantly improved overall yield (about 80% versus 30-68%) and significantly improved isolated purity (&gt;96%) without the necessity of chromatographic purification. The method is advantageously reproducible with respect to yield and isolated purity. TTiis procedure also advantageously avoids using sodium metal and relatively expensive reagents-such as for example tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium(0) that would be required for the preparation of compound 2 by other methods disclosed heieinabove.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, step b, 2-hydroxy-3-(nitro-pyridinyl)-acrylic acid ethyl ester 3 may be prepared by treating methyl-nitropyridine 2 with a suitable base, such as for example sodium ethoxide, lithium ethoxide, lithium t-butoxide, sodium t-butoxide, potassium t-butoxide or lithium hexamethyldisilazide, in a suitable solvent, such as for example ethanol or t-butanol, and then treating the reaction mixture with an oxalate diester such as for example dimethyl oxalate or diethyl oxalate at ambient temperature, and allowing the reaction mixture<br><br>
to stand for about 12 hours to about 48 hours at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture is then treated with a mineral acid, such as for example hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, to about pH 1. The precipitate is collected by filtration, washed sequentially with a suitable solvent, such as for example ethanol and di-isopropyl ether, respectively, to afford 2-hydroxy-3-(nitro-pyridinyl)-acrylic acid ethyl ester 3 or its tautomeric keto ester.<br>
Advantageously it has been found that compound 3 may also be synthesized by another method according to Scheme 1, step b, by slowly adding compound 2 to a premixed solution of diethyl oxalate and a suitable base, in a suitable solvent, at about 2°C to about ambient temperature. Accordingly a suitable base such as for example sodium ethoxide, lithium ethoxide, lithium t-butoxide, sodium t-butoxide, potassium t-butoxide or lithium hexamethyldisilazide is added to a suitable solvent such as for example tetrahydrofuran, at about 2°C. The mixture is stirred for about 20 minutes and then about 3 equivalents of diethyl oxalate is added at about -0.3°C to about 4°C, After about 10 minutes, a solution of about one equivalent of compound 2 and a suitable solvent, such as for example tetrahydrofuran, is added at about 4°C to about 9°C. The mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. When the reaction is complete as indicated by HPLC analysis or other chromatographic analysis as is well known to one skilled in the ait, the reaction mixture is cooled to about 1°C and treated with saturated ammonium chloride solution at about 1°C to about 9°C. Compound 3 is isolated by further dilution with water and/or a co-solvent, such as for example isopropanoL Most advantageously compound 2 is condensed with diethyl oxalate wherein sodium ethoxide is the preferred base and tetrahydrofuran is the preferred solvent following the above described order of additions, and reaction times and conditions. The synthesis of compound 3a-l (2-hydroxy-3-(3-iutn&gt;"pyridin«2-yl)-acrylic acid ethyl ester) by this more advantageous "step blf procedure resulted in a surprisingly significant reduction in reaction time (about 2 hours versus about 2 to 3 days) and provided compound 3a-l in significantly improved yield (about 88% versus 32-68%).<br>

Thus, a mixture of compound 3 and a suitable catalyst, such as for example palladium on carbon, in a suitable solvent, such as for example ethanol or methanol, is hydrogenated in a<br><br>
manner as is well known to one skilled in the art for about one to about three hours at a pressure of about 45 psi to about 1200 psi to provide, after purification, intermediate compound 4. Advantageously compound 4 is prepared by this procedure wherein absolute ethanol is the preferred solvent and palladium on carbon is the preferred catalyst. Under these conditions, an advantageous low catalyst loading of 10 weight percent is achieved.<br>
Alternatively, 2-hydroxy-3-(nitro-pyridinyl)-acrylic acid ethyl ester 3, or its tautomeric keto ester, may be chemically reduced to provide intermediate compound 4. For example a mixture of compound 3, SnCh and TiCLt ia a suitable solvent, such as for example ethanol, is heated at reflux for about 4 hours to provide, after purification by methods as are well known to one skilled in the art, intermediate compound 4.<br>
When diethyl oxalate is employed for the preparation of compound 3, subsequent reduction of compound 3 affords intermediate compound 4 as the ethyl ester.

Amide 6 is isolated from the reaction mixture by methods well known to one skilled in the art N»Ci^-alkyl-substituted amides 6 are prepared by treating intermediate azaindole ester 4 or 5 with a Ci^-alkyl amine by<br><br>
methods well known to one skilled in the art. For example, intermediate azaindole ester 4 or 5 may be treated with a Ci^-alkyl amine, such as for example methylamine as a concentrated aqueous solution or neat with an excess of a Ci^-alkyl amine, and monitoring the reaction for completion by thin layer chromatography or other chromatographic methods as are well known to one skilled in the art The desired N-Q-6-alkyl amide 6 is collected after dilution of the reaction with water or by extraction methods as are well known to one skilled in the art.

Use of methanol as solvent provides significantly greater solubility of the starting material and significantly faster reaction time. Azaindole ethyl ester 4 is also transestedfied under these conditions to the corresponding azaindole methyl ester 5, but both esters 4 and 5 are converted to the desired primary amide 6 under the reaction conditions. The reaction is preferably conducted using 7N ammonia in methanol, a reaction temperature of about 50°C and an initial pressure of about 35 psi for about 49 hours. During this time the pressure in the reaction vessel drops to about 16 psi.

Alternatively, a mixture of intermediate amide 6 and about 1.5 equivalents of cesium carbonate in a suitable solvent, such as for example dimethylformamide or NMP, is treated with a suitable diarydisulfide (about 1.1 equivalents) and then the mixture is heated at about 90 °C to about 100°C for about 12 hours to about 20 hours. The reaction is monitored by thin<br><br>
layer chromatography or other chromatographic methods as are well known to one skilled in the art. The compound of formula (T) is isolated and chromatographically purified by methods well known to one skilled in the art. Compounds of formula (I) wherein R3-X is heterocycle-S are prepared in a similar manner using appropriately substituted diheterocycledisulfides.<br>
Advantageously, a compound of formula (I) is synthesized according to Scheme 1, step f, by adding to preferred solvent NMP as a single portion, about 1.5 equivalents of the diaryldisulfide, about two equivalents of cesium carbonate and about one equivalent of amide 6.

Methodology:<br>
1.	500 inL of fresh assay buffer is made: 50mM TrispH 7.5r lOmM MgQ^ 2 mM DTT<br>
and imM EGTA<br>
2.	Compounds to be evaluated arc obtained as lO^L of lOmM stock dissolved in 100%<br>
DMSO. Using a Biomek 2000 liquid handling robot, serial dilutions are made to yield 10,1,0.1,0.01 and 0.001 \JM final compound dilutions added as 5\xL additions to Falcon U bottom plates.   Typically 8 compounds are tested per 96 well plate with column 1 and 12 serving as control wells. A routine screening assay will consist of 32 compounds, which equals 4 assay plates.<br>
3.	Assay plate maps aie set up according to the following pattern CKlePlateMap.xls<br><br><br>
4.	Once 5 jiL of compound has been added as indicated, 5pL of dephosphorylated casein<br>
(dissolved in distilled H20)(0.2|xg/pL) and 20pL CKle (3ng/\xL) are added to the appropriate wells.<br>
5.	Finally 20jiL Y-33P-ATP (0.02\iCi/\xL) /IO\M cold ATP are added (equals<br>
approximately 2xlO6 CPM per well).<br>
6.	The Falcon U-Bottom assay plate containing the above 50\xL reaction volume is<br>
vortexed and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.<br>
7.	At the end of 2 hours, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 65pL of ice cold 2mM<br>
cold ATP (made up in assay buffer) to the assay plates using a Beckman Multimek<br>
8.	At the same time 25 \iL 100% ice cold TCA made up in distilled EfeO is added to a<br>
matching number of Millipore MAPH filter plates.<br>
9.	Using a handheld 8-channel pipettor, 100|xL of the reaction mixture is transferred from<br>
the Falcon U-Bottom Plate to the Millipore MAPH filter plates presoaked with TCA.<br>
10.	The Millipore MAPH filter plates are mixed gently and allowed to sit at room<br>
temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins.<br>
11.	After 30 minutes the filter plates are placed on a Millipore vacuum manifold and<br>
filtered at no more than 8mm Hg as the MAPH filters tend to "air lock" at higher vacuum settings.<br>
12.	The filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2xl50jiL 20% TCA, 2x150<br>
jiL 10% TCA and 2x150^1,5% TCA (total of 6 washes per plate/900pL per well).<br>
13.	Plates are allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. The next day 40\iL Packard<br>
Microscint-20 Scintillation Fluid is added per well using a Titertek Multidrop<br><br>
dispenser; the plates are sealed and counted for 2 minutes/well in a Packard Topcount NXT Scintillation Counter (CPM values/well are captured).<br>
Calculation:<br>
1-      Counts Per Minute (CPM) data is captured and imported into a proprietary data<br>
calculation and archiving database (Activity Base by IDBS version 5.0).<br>
2.	Column 1 for each plate reflects total phosphorylation activity of the enzyme in the<br>
absence of any inhibiting compound and thus represents 100%. Column 12 reflects<br>
any nonspecific phosphorylation/retained radioactivity activity in the absence of<br>
inhibiting compound and enzyme. Typically we see approximately 1% of Total<br>
CPMs that are "nonspecific"*<br>
3.	By having determined the "total" and "nonspecific" CPMs for each plate one is<br>
able to determine the % inhibition of the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate the<br>
substrate for each concentration of test compound. This % inhibition data is used to<br>
calculate an IC50 value (concentration at which a compound is able to inhibit the<br>
enzyme activity by 50%) for a compound using a non-linear curve fit program<br>
contained with the Activitybase calculation protocol (DG0027-CK1-D-BL) (Study:<br>

Cellular Circadian Assay Experimental Procedures<br>
Cell culture: Mperl-luc Rat-1 fibroblasts (P2C4) cultures were split every 3-4 days (-10-20% confluence) onto 150 cm2 vented polystyrene tissue culture flasks (Falcon # 35-5001) and maintained in growth media [EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV); 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco #16000-044); and 50 LU./mLpenicillin-stre]ptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-C1)] at 37°C and 5% CO2.<br>
Stable transfection: Rat-1 fibroblast cultures at 30-50% confluence were co-transfected with vectors containing the Zeocin resistance selectable marker for stable transfection and an mPer-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. After 24-48 hours, cultures were split onto 96 well plates and maintained in growth media supplemented with 50-100 jig/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen #45-0430) for 10-14 days. Zeocin-resistant stable transfectants were assessed for reporter expression by supplementing growth media with 100 \JM luciferin (Promega #E1603) and assaying luciferase activity on a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard Model #C384V00). Rat-1 clones expressing both Zeocin-resistance and mPeri-driven luciferase activity were synchronized by 50% horse serum [HS (Gibco #16050-122)] serum shock and assessed for circadian reporter activity. Mperl-luc Rat-1 fibroblasts clone P2C4 was selected for compound testing.<br>
Synchronization protocol: Mperl-luc Rat-1 fibroblasts (P2C4) were plated (40-50% confluence) onto opaque 96-well tissue culture plates (PerlrinELmer #6005680) and    . maintained in growth media supplemented with 100 p.g/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen #45-0430) until cultures reached 100% confluence (48-72 h). Cultures were synchronized with 100 \xL synchronization media [EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV); 100 UJJmL penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-C1); 50% HS (Gibco #16050-122)] for 2 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. After synchronization, cultures were rinsed with 100 \xL EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After rinse, media was replaced with 300 pL CO2-independent media [CO2I (Gibco #18045-088); 2mM l^glutamine (Cellgro #25-005-Cl); 100 LUVmL penitillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl); 100 \M luciferin (Promega #E1603)]. Compounds tested for circadian effects were added to CCVindependent media in 03% DMSO (final concentration). Cultures were immediately sealed with TopSeal-A film (Packard #6005185) and transferred for luciferase activity measurement<br>
Automated Circadian Reporter Measurement: After synchronization, assay plates were maintained at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator (Forma Scientific Model #3914). In Vivo luciferase activity was  estimated by measuring relative light output on  a TopCount<br><br>
scintillation counter (Packard Model #C384VO0).  Plates were transferred from incubator to reader using an ORCA robotic arm (Beckman Instruments) and SAME-NT automated scheduling software (Version 3.3; SAGIAN/Beckman Instruments). Data Analysis: Microsoft Excel and XLfit (Version 2.0.9; IDBS) were used to import, manipulate and graph data. Period analysis was performed either by determining the interval between relative light output minima over several daysiff by Fourier Transform. Both methods produced nearly identical period estimation over a range of circadian periods. Potency is reported as EC^t+ih, which is presented as the effective micromolar concentration that induced a 1 hour lengthening of period The data was analyzed by fitting a hyperbolic curve to the data expressed as period change (y-axis) versus the concentration of test compound (x-axis) in XLfit and the ECAt+ih was interpolated from this curve.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
