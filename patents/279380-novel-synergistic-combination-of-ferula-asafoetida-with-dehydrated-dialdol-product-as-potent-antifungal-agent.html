				<td>NOVEL SYNERGISTIC COMBINATION OF FERULA ASAFOETIDA WITH DEHYDRATED DIALDOL PRODUCT AS POTENT ANTIFUNGAL<br>
AGENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic combination of Ferula asafoetida with dehydrated dialdol product as potent antifungal agent. The present invention relates to the formation of environmentally safe fungicide taking advantage of the bioenhancer characteristics found in natural products and bioefficacy of synthetic compound, which in a way full fill the main objective of inventing an eco friendly fungicide. The presence of natural products in formulation allows the use of synthetic compound at lower concentration with enhanced in vitro activity against the pathogenic fungus.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
A variety of crop diseases owe their origin to pathogenic microorganisms, which include bacteria, virus and fungi. Among them fungi are responsible for a major loss of crops all over the world. Rhizoctonia bataticola is considered as one of most noxious fungus [1-4 ] which is constantly seeking attention of scientist throughout the world. Though a number of chemical, broad-spectrum fungicides available for the control of fungus that attack and damage food crops and economically important crops [5-8]. These chemical fungicides aim at fungus eradication and kill the fungus. In this process many non target species are killed and in addition they not only affect the ecosystem but also pollute the atmosphere with chemical, the water we drink, air we breathe and food we eat. Fungi also develop resistance to the fungicide in the course of time on continuous usage. Hence, there is a prime need for<br>
<br>
 <br>
antifungal agent, which is biodegradable, eco friendly, does not affect the beneficial organisms, non-toxic to human beings and at the same time effective against the target fungus. This has diverted the attention of scientists towards product of natural origin. Though natural products are rich source of anti-infective, they carry their own limitations of less potency as compared to synthetic chemicals, low availability, high cost of extraction, structural complexity and instability. In this regard superiority of combination consisting of mixture of bioactive compounds over a single isolated constituent has been well established in which one of the compound generally natural in origin, acts as bioenhancer. This effect is known as synergism which can be defined as a phenomenon in which two different compounds are combined to enhance their individual activity.<br>
The prior art reveals the activity of only herbal compositions containing Ferula asafoetida as one of the ingredients. These herbal compositions are tested for the treatment of human disease only.<br>

Accordingly, we have formulated herein a novel composition comprising Ferula asafoetida and Synthetic compound of formula 1 against plant pathogen for the first time. The activity of F.asafoetida never been tested either alone or in combination against phytopathogen ,R.bataticola.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention deals with a combination of synthetic compound of formula (1) and Asfoetida (N1) which shows tremendous activity against the test fungus. The present invention is aimed to overcome or avoid problems faced in the control of fungus as mentioned in the literature. The synergistic interaction provided by the composition herein allows reduction of the quantity and improvement of efficacy of synthetic compound by administrating with mildly active natural product (Nl). This reduction allows usage of fungicide which is otherwise too highly toxic or produce unacceptable side effects at fungicidal dosages, allows usage at dosages less than those which produce side effects and should reduce or at least delay the occurrence of natural resistance to important chemical fungicides. The use of products of the present invention offer a low dose treatment with enhanced action comparable to that of standard dose alone.<br>

Detailed description of the present invention:<br>
The invention pertains to method for increasing the antifungal activity of newly identified anti Rhizoctonia bataticola agent, by administering a mildly active naturally occurring product in combination with it, thereby reducing the effective amount of the synthetic compound required as compared to the amount required when it is administered alone. The present invention provides a newly identified antifungal agent (formula 1) which shows antifungal activity at very low concentration when tested alone and also its synergistic combination with Asafoetida which enhances its activity further at the same concentration. Compound of formula 1 can be prepared following standard method as reference 9, shown in Scheme 1 wherein requisite aldehyde was dissolved in ethanol and NaOH. To this reaction mixture, acetone was added slowly in an incubator-shaker at room temperature. After half an hour of continuous shaking the reaction mixture resulted to a clear pale yellow solution. Further shaking for about 10 minutes, cloudiness appeared which settled down slowly. The precipitate was then filtered out and re-crystallized by appropriate solvent.<br>

Formula 1 (Synthetic compound I)<br>
The activity of the samples was determined by standard food poisoning method [as reference 10]. Wherein, Potato dextrose agar of HI MEDIA, MU096 was used as culture medium and test samples were dissolved in acetone. Single spore cultures of fungal species, grown and maintained on potato dextrose agar media at 28±1°C were used for the experiments. The compounds were mixed aseptically with PDA media and were sterilized. The medium with acetone was served as control. The Petri plates having 9 cm inner diameter were taken, and 25 mL of the sterilized PDA containing test samples were plated in the centre. After solidification, 0.5 cm diameter agar discs taken from a 48 h old sporulated fungi culture was placed with the fungal side downward in the centre of each plate with the help of sterile cork borer and glass rod. The plates were incubated in dark at 28±1°C. Radial growths were determined by measuring the colony size along two diameters at right angles after 24 h interval. Three replicates for each treatment were prepared. The experiments were repeated three times. The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the following formula: I = C - T / C x 100, where, I = percentage of inhibition; C = radial growth in control -disc diameter (cm); T = radial growth in treated - disc diameter (cm).<br>
The novel antifungal composition of the present invention has been studied against the Rhizoctonia bataticola for the first time. This combination exhibits an excellent activity against the fungus even at very low concentration. The antifungal composition comprises plural kinds of antimicrobial agents so that resistant fungi may not be produced.<br>

SAMPLE FIGURE 1<br>
Examples:<br>
Example 1. (Table 1, S.No.l) 1.650 mg of compound of formula 1, dissolved in acetone, was mixed with 25 ml of PDA media to attain a concentration of 66ppm and tested against the Rhizoctonia bataticola. It shows tremendous activity with 61.11% of inhibition.<br>
Example2.	(Table 1, S.No.2&amp;3) When 0.825 mg and 0.413 mg of<br>
the same compound, dissolved in acetone, was mixed separately with 25ml of PDA to attain concentrations of 33ppm and 16.5ppm, it surprisingly resists the growth of the fungus upto 48.86 % and 31% respectively.<br>
Example3. (Table 2, S.No.5) 1.650 mg of natural product, dissolved in acetone, was mixed with 25ml of PDA to attain a concentration of 66 ppm, shows 33.33 % of inhibition.<br>
Example4. (Table 2, S.No.3) However synergistic interaction shows some unexpected results, which can be of great use in agriculture to combat the fungus. The combination of synthetic<br>
<br>
 <br>
compound and natural product, consisting 0.825mg each, in acetone, dissolved in 25 ml of PDA (33ppm of both the components or 50% of each component), inhibited the growth upto 60%.<br>
Example5. (Table 2, S.No.4) A combination of 0.412mg of synthetic compound and 1.237 mg of natural product, dissolved in acetone, was mixed with 25ml of PDA. This Combination, consisting of 16.5ppm synthetic compound and 49.5ppm natural product, shows 26.1% inhibition.<br>
Example6. (Table 2, S.No.2) A combination of 1.237 mg of synthetic compound and 0.412 mg of natural product, dissolved in acetone, was mixed with 25ml of PDA. This Combination, consisting of 49.5 ppm synthetic compound and 16.5ppm natural product, shows 26.1% inhibition..<br>
The results revealed that:<br>
(i)       Example 4, consisting of 33ppm of each component, is the best<br>
synergistic combination prepared by us for the first time as<br>
potent antifungal agent, (ii)      The above combination consists very low concentration of both<br>
the components (formula 1 and N1, 33ppm each), (iii)     The  combination  is  effective  even  at  mild  concentration  of<br>
66ppm. (iv)     Thus we can safely propose that composition having synthetic<br>
compound of formula (1) only 33ppm in single dose of 66ppm<br>
can be used as potent antifungal agent to control the highly<br>
pathogenic fungus R.bataticola with minimum or no adverse<br>
impact on the environment. Hence it can be used as eco friendly<br>
antifungal agent, (v)       As the combination consists of very low concentration of natural<br>
product (Nl)  so  it can solve the availability problem of the<br>
natural products with improved efficacy.<br>
