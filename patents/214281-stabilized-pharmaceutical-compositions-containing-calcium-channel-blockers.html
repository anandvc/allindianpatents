				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Stabilized pharmaceutical compositions containing a calcium blocker<br>
[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to a stabilized pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing a calcium blocker.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
Calcium blockers are well known as antihypertensive agents, which can<br>
exist in a lot of formulations and are commercially available (for example, USP<br>
3,485,847, USP 3,985,758, USP 4,572,909 and the like). These formulations,<br>
however, are not always satisfactory in their stability such as their storage<br>
stability. A pharmaceutical composition having excellent stability such as<br>
storage stability has been desired.<br>
The inventors have made a great effort on the study cf pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing calcium blockers for a long Deriod. They have found<br>
that a pharmacologically acceptable alkaline material is added to a calcium<br>
blocker to afford a pharmaceutical composition having excellent stability such<br>
as storage stability.<br>
The present invention relates to a stabilized pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing a calcium blocker.<br>

Japanese patent publication No. Sho 60-120861, and the like).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be prepared<br>
easily by using calcium blockers of formula (I) or salts thereof, alkaline materials<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable additives in a known manner (for example,<br>
procedures such as mixing and kneading with water and wet granulation, etc.).<br>
Formulations such as tablets, capsules and granules, for example, can be<br>
prepared as follows. To the alkaline materials placed in a high shear granulator<br>
is added surfactant(s) as needed, and then a calcium blocker of formula (I) or a<br>
salt thereof, fillers, binders and disintegrants are furthermore added with mixing.<br>
In some cases, other kinds of alkaline materials are also added as needed.<br>
Subsequently, an aqueous solution of the binder(s) is added to the mixture<br>
obtained to prepare a wet mass in the high shear granulator. In the<br>
preparation of tablets and capsules, the wet mass obtained is dried in a fluid<br>
bed dryer, and the dried mass obtained is cut by a cutting mill and passed<br>
through a screen. The desired tablets or capsules can be prepared by mixing<br>
the screened granules and lubricant(s) with a V-shaped blender and then<br>
tableting or filling the resulting mixture into capsules, respectively. On the<br>
other hand, in the preparation of granules, the wet mass obtained above is<br>
extruded using an extrusion granulator to prepare -wet granules, which are then<br>
dried using an air-through tray dryer. The desired granules can be obtained by<br>
cutting the dried granules obtained using the cutting mill and then passing<br>
through a screen.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail by Examples, but the<br>
present invention is not limited to these Examples.<br>
Best mode for carrying out the invention<br>
(Example 1) Tablets 1<br>
The desired tablets were prepared using the components, the quantity of<br>
each of which is listed in the formula shown in Table 1, as follows.<br>
To light magnesium aluminometasilicate (Grade FL2) placed in a high shear<br>
granulator was added polysorbate 80 with stirring, and then Azelnidipine,<br>
crystalline cellulose, D-mannitol, low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose and<br>
sodium bicarbonate were added successively with mixing. Subsequently an<br>
aqueous hydroxypropylcellulose solution was added to the mixture to prepare a<br>
wet mass, which was dried in a fluid bed dryer into which inlet air at 90°C was<br>
supplied continuously until the temperature of the exhausted air from the dryer<br>
went up to 55°C. The dried mass obtained was cut by a cutting mill and<br>
passed through a screen of 1.0-mm meshes. The desired tablets were prepared<br>
by mixing the screened granules and magnesium stearate for 10 min using a<br>
V-shaped blender and then compressing the resulting mixture using a tableting<br>
machine with a punch of 8.0-mm diameter.<br>
In each of Examples 1-5 and Reference example 1, 8 mg of Azelnidipine<br><br>
A suitable amount of this formulation was pulverized in an agate mortar and<br>
passed through a sieve with 20 meshes. Subsequently, 1000 mg of the powder<br>
obtained (corresponding to five tablets) was placed in a centrifuge tube and after<br>
the addition of 50 ml of purified water as defined by The Pharmacopoeia of<br>
Japan, the resulting mixture was shaken for 20 min using a shaker. After<br>
shaking, the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and<br>
the supernatant obtained was passed through a filter with a pore size of 0.45-<br>
µm, and then the pH value of the filtrate was measured with a pH meter. The<br>
pH value of the solution obtained was 9.5.<br>
When this formulation was stored at 25°C under lightproof and water-<br>
resistant conditions, 98% of the active ingredient in this formulation was<br>
detected as unaltered even after storage for 36 months.<br>
(Example 2) Tablets 2<br>
The desired tablets were prepared using the components, the quantity of<br>
each of which is listed in the formula shown in Table 2, as follows.<br>

stirring, and then Azelnidipine, crystalline cellulose, D-mannitol, low substituted<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium (carmellose calcium)<br>
and sodium bicarbonate were added successively with mixing. Subsequently,<br>
an aqueous hydroxypropylcellulose solution was added to the mixture to prepare<br>
a wet mass, which was dried in a fluid bed dryer into which inlet air at 90°C was<br>
supplied continuously until the temperature of the exhausted air from the dryer<br>
went up to 55°C. The dried mass obtained was cut by a cutting mill and<br>
passed through a screen of 1.0-mm meshes. The desired tablets were prepared<br>
by mixing the screened granules and magnesium stearate for 10 min using a<br>
V-shaped blender and then compressing the resulting mixture using a tableting<br>

mentioned in Example 1. The pH value of the solution obtained was 10.0.<br>
When this formulation was stored at 25°C under lightproof and water-<br>
resistant conditions, 99% of the active ingredient in this formulation was<br>
detected as unaltered even after storage for 36 months.<br>
{Example 3} Capsules 1<br>
The desired capsules were obtained by preparing a mixture of components,<br>
the quantity of each of which is listed in the formula shown in Table 2, in a<br>
similar manner to that mentioned in Example 2 and then filling a defined<br>
amount of the resulting mixture into each No. 3 capsule.<br>
The pH value of this formulation was measured in a similar manner to that<br>

mentioned in Example 2.<br>
The pH value of this formulation was measured in a similar manner to that<br>
mentioned in Example 1. The pH value of the solution obtained was 11.0.<br>
When this formulation was stored at 25°C under lightproof and water-<br>
resistant conditions, 95% of the active ingredient in this formulation was<br>
detected as unaltered even after storage for 36 months.<br>
(Example 5) Tablets 4<br>
The desired tablets were prepared using the components, the quantity of<br>
each of which is listed in the formula shown in Table 3, as follows.<br>
To calcium silicate placed in a high shear granulator was added polysorbate<br>
80 with stirring, and then Azelnidipine, D-mannitol and low substituted<br>
hydroxypropylcellulase were added successively with mixing. Subsequently, an<br>
aqueous hydroxypropylcellulose solution was added to the mixture to prepare a<br>
wet mass, which was dried in a fluid bed dryer into which inlet air at 90°C was<br>
supplied continuously until the temperature of the exhausted air from the dryer<br>

resistant conditions, 97% of the active ingredient in this formulation was<br>
detected as unaltered even after storage for 36 months.<br>
(Reference example 1) Tablets A<br>
The desired tablets were prepared using the components, the quantity of<br>
each of which is listed in the formula shown in Table 4, as follows.<br>
Azelnidipine, D-mannitol and low substituted hydraxypropylcellulose were<br>
mixed in a high shear granulator, and then polysorbate SO was further added<br>
with mixing. Subsequently, an aqueous hydroxypropyicellulose solution was<br>
added to the mixture to prepare a wet mass, which was dried in a fluid bed<br>
dryer into which inlet air at 90°C was supplied continuously until the<br>
temperature of the exhausted air from the dryer went up to 55°C. The dried<br>
mass obtained was cut by a cutting mill and passed through a screen of 1.0-mm<br>
meshes. The desired tablets were prepared by mixing the screened granules<br>
