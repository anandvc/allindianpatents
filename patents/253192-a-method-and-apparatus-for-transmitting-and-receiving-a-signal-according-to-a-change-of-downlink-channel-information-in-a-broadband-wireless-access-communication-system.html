				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a Broadband Wireless Access<br>
(BWA) communication system, and more particularly to an apparatus and method<br>
for signal transmission and reception between a Mobile Station (MS) and a Base<br>
Station (BS) when a change occurs in downlink channel information while the<br>
MS is in a sleep mode.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a 4th generation (4G) communication system, which is the next<br>
generation communication system, research has been pursued to provide users<br>
with services having various qualities of service (QoSs) at a high transmission<br>
speed. Recently, in the 4G communication system, research has been actively<br>
pursued to support high speed services while ensuring mobility and QoS for<br>
Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication systems such as a wireless<br>
local area network (LAN) and a metropolitan area network (MAN) system. A<br>
representative communication system designed in order to achieve such goals as<br>
described above includes an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers) 802.16e communication system. <br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system utilizes an Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme in order to support a broadband<br>
transmission network for a physical channel of the wireless MAN system.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram schematically illustrating a conventional IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system has a multi-cell structure including a cell 100 and a cell<br>
150. Also, the IEEE 802.16e communication system includes a BS 110<br>
controlling the cell 100, a BS 140 controlling the cell 150, and a plurality of MSs<br>
111, 113, 130, 151, and 153. The transmission and reception of signals between<br>
the BSs 110 and 140 and the MSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153 is accomplished<br>
using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme. Herein, the MS 130 is located in a boundary<br>
area, i.e., handover area, between the cell 100 and the cell 150. Accordingly, when<br><br>
the MS 130 moves into the cell 150 controlled by the BS 140 while transmitting<br>
and receiving with the BS 110, the serving BS for the MS 130 changes from the<br>
BS 110 to the BS 140.<br>
In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, the power consumption of<br>
the MS plays an important part in the performance of the entire system. Therefore,<br>
a sleep mode operation and an awake mode operation corresponding to the sleep<br>
mode operation have been proposed for the BS and the MS in order to minimize<br>
the power consumption of the MS. Further, in order to cope with a channel state<br>
change between the MS and the BS, the MS periodically performs ranging for<br>
adjusting the timing offset, the frequency offset, and the transmit power between<br>
the BS and the MS.<br>
Hereinafter, an operation for downlink burst profile allocation in a typical<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system will be described.<br>
First, when the MS is powered on, the MS monitors all frequency bands<br>
set in advance in the MS and detects a pilot signal having a largest intensity, i.e., a<br>
largest Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio (CINR). Further, the MS<br>
determines a BS transmitting the pilot signal having the largest CINR as the<br>
serving BS, which is a BS to which the MS currently belongs. Then, the MS<br>
receives a preamble of a downlink frame transmitted from the serving BS and<br>
acquires system synchronization between the MS and the serving BS.<br>
When the MS synchronizes to the serving BS, the serving BS transmits a<br>
DL(Downlink)_MAP message and a UL(Uplink)_MAP message to the MS. The<br>
DLMAP message has a message format as shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the DL_MAP message contains a plurality of<br>
Information Elements (IEs), such as 'Management Message Type' representing a<br>
type of a message being currently transmitted, 'PHY synchronization' set<br>
correspondingly to the modulation scheme and demodulation scheme applied to a<br>
physical (PHY) channel for acquisition of synchronization, 'DCD count'<br>
representing a count corresponding to changes in a configuration of a Downlink<br>
Channel Descriptor (DCD) message including a downlink burst profile, 'Base<br>
Station ID' representing a BS identifier, and 'Number of DL_MAP Elements n'<br>
representing the number of the elements following the 'Base Station ID'. The<br>
DLMAP message in Table 1 contains n number of DL_MAP IEs, each of which<br>
includes a Downlink Interval Usage Code (DIUC) that has a value mapped to a<br>
downlink burst profile included in the DCD message. That is, the MS can detect<br>
information about the coding scheme (Forward Error Correction (FEC) code<br>
type) and modulation scheme applied to downlink bursts included in the downlink<br>
frame by extracting the DIUC value from the DL_MAP message. Accordingly,<br>
the MS can receive the data (data frame) in the downlink burst while identifying<br>
the downlink bursts in the downlink frame.<br>
When movement of the MS occurs or a change in the surrounding<br>
channel conditions of the MS causes change in the CINR value of the pilot signal<br>
received by the MS from the serving BS, it is necessary to also change the DIUC<br>
value applied to the data to be transmitted by the MS, correspondingly to the<br>
change in the CINR value of the pilot signal.<br>
Further, when it is necessary for the BS to change the downlink burst<br>
profile, the BS changes the burst profile and then transmits a DCD message<br>
including the information about the change to the MS. Then, by receiving the<br>
DCD message, the MS can recognize the change in the downlink burst profile<br>
from the DCD message.<br>
However, when the downlink burst profile changes, i.e., the DCD<br>
message changes, while the MS is in a sleep mode, the MS cannot recognize the<br><br>
change of the DCD message in realtime because the MS is in the sleep mode.<br>
FIG. 2 schematically illustrates an operation of an MS when the DCD<br>
message changes while the MS is in a sleep mode in a conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system. In FIG. 2, the MS and the BS set up protocols about<br>
transmissible and receivable modulation schemes and coding schemes in advance<br>
for signal transmission and reception between them. The setup of protocols about<br>
the modulation schemes and coding schemes is achieved through transmission<br>
and reception of the downlink burst profile, i.e. transmission and reception of the<br>
DCD message.<br>
Further, it is necessary to prepare protocols about the modulation schemes<br>
and coding schemes between the BS and the MS in order to enable the MS to<br>
normally restart data transmission/reception after awakening from the sleep mode.<br>
However, because the MS does not receive any signal from the BS at all<br>
during the sleep interval in which the MS stays in the sleep mode, the MS cannot<br>
recognize any change in the downlink burst profile, i.e., DIUC set, made by the<br>
BS in the sleep interval. When the DIUCs used by the MS and the BS do not<br>
coincide due to the sleep mode operation of the MS, it is impossible to transmit<br>
and receive data between the MS and the BS.<br>
Hereinafter, different scenarios in which the DIUCs used by the MS and<br>
the BS no longer coincide due to the sleep mode operation of the MS will be<br>
discussed.<br>
The first case corresponds to when the DCD message changes while the<br>
MS performs the sleep mode operation, i.e., while the MS stays in the sleep<br>
interval.<br>
In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, the MS detects the DCD<br>
count included in the currently received DL_MAP message and compares the<br>
detected value with the DCD count value currently stored in the MS itself. If the<br>
DCD count value included in the DL_MAP message currently received by the<br>
MS and the DCD count value currently stored in the MS are different, the MS<br>
recognizes the change of the DCD message. That is, because the DCD count<br>
values are different, the version numbers of the downlink burst profiles are<br>
different. Therefore, the MS can recognize the version number of the downlink<br>
burst profile using the DCD count value.<br><br>
However, in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system, it is<br>
impossible to notify the change in the downlink burst profile to an MS that has<br>
awakened from the sleep mode. Therefore, if the BS transmits downlink data to<br>
the MS using the downlink burst profile of the BS itself, without recognizing that<br>
the downlink burst profile of the BS is different from the downlink burst profile<br>
stored in the MS, the MS cannot normally receive the downlink data.<br>
The scenario above will be described in more detail hereinafter with<br>
reference to FIG. 2.<br>
First, however, it is noted that FIG. 2 is based on an assumption that the<br>
parameter denoting the DCD count value managed by the BS 200 is N, the<br>
parameter denoting the DCD count value managed by the MS 250 is M, and the<br>
two parameters N and M have an initial value of '0'. When the BS 200 detects<br>
that it is necessary to change the downlink burst profile while the MS 250 stays in<br>
the sleep mode, i.e. in the sleep interval, the BS sets the DCD count value N,<br>
which is managed by the BS 200, to be '1' (N=1) in step 211 and transmits the<br>
changed DCD message in step 213. Although the BS 200 transmitted the changed<br>
DCD message, the MS 250 in the sleep interval cannot recognize the change of<br>
the DCD message. Therefore, the MS 250 maintains the value '0' (M=0) of the<br>
parameter denoting the DCD count value, which is managed by the MS 250 itself,<br>
in step 215.<br>
When the sleep interval terminates, the MS 250 receives the DL_MAP<br>
message from the BS 200 in the listening interval in step 217. In the DL_MAP<br>
message, the DCD count value, more specifically, the value of the parameter N<br>
representing the DCD count value managed by the BS 200, is set as '1'. Therefore,<br>
the MS 250 recognizes from the DCD count value that it is necessary to receive a<br>
new DCD message from the BS 200.<br>
After the listening interval terminates, the MS 200 mode-transits into the<br>
awake mode and waits for the DCD message in step 219. When the BS 200<br>
detects occurrence of a data targeting the MS 250 while the MS 250 stays in the<br>
awake mode, the BS 200 transmits to the MS 250 a TRF_IND message indicating<br>
that there is a data to be transmitted targeting the MS 250, i.e. a TRF_IND<br>
message in which a bit representing the MS 250 in a sleep identifier bitmap is<br>
marked by a positive value, i.e., ' 1', in step 221.<br>
After transmitting the TRF_IND message, the BS 200 transmits data to<br>
the MS 250 in step 223. However, as described above, although the BS 200<br><br>
transmits the data using the newly changed downlink burst profile, the MS 250<br>
still uses the downlink burst profile before the change. As a result, the DIUC<br>
value applied to the data transmitted from the BS 200 to the MS 250 is different<br>
from the DIUC value stored in the MS 250, and the MS 250 cannot normally<br>
demodulate the data transmitted from the BS 200 in step 225.<br>
As described above, in the first scenario, the DIUCs used by the MS and<br>
the BS become different, i.e., no longer coincide, due to change of the DCD<br>
message while the MS performs the sleep mode operation, i.e., while the MS<br>
stays in the sleep interval.<br>
However, as will be described below, in the second scenario, the DIUCs<br>
used by the MS and the BS become different due to the sleep mode operation of<br>
the MS because the MS itself changes the DIUC value to be proper for the MS<br>
while the MS performs the sleep mode operation, i.e., while the MS stays in the<br>
sleep interval.<br>
More specifically, when the MS moves while it is in the sleep interval or<br>
when the surrounding channel condition of the MS changes to make the CINR<br>
value of the pilot channel signal from the serving BS become different from that<br>
before the MS mode-transits into the sleep mode, the MS changes the DIUC<br>
value to be most proper for the MS itself. For example, when the CINR value of<br>
the pilot channel signal measured, while the MS stays in the sleep interval,<br>
becomes smaller than the CINR value of the pilot channel signal measured before<br>
the MS comes into the sleep interval, if the MS transmits data to the BS using the<br>
existing DIUC value without update, it is highly possible that the data transmitted<br>
by the MS has an error.<br>
As described above, in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system,<br>
if the DCD message changes while the MS is in the sleep mode, it is impossible<br>
to normally perform data transmission and reception, thereby causing data loss.<br>
The data loss may degrade the general performance of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system targeting a high speed data transmission. Therefore, a<br>
need exists for a solution for data transmission and reception reflecting the DCD<br>
message change in realtime.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the<br><br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention proposes a scheme for signal transmission and<br>
reception by a Mobile Station (MS) according to a change of downlink channel<br>
information in an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) 802.16e<br>
communication system, which is a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA)<br>
communication system. That is, the present invention proposes a scheme for<br>
signal transmission and reception using a same Downlink Interval Usage Code<br>
(DIUC) between the BS and the MS by reporting the change of a Downlink<br>
Channel Descriptor(DCD) message, i.e., the change of the DCD count value,<br>
from the MS to the BS, when the DCD message changes while the MS is in the<br>
sleep mode in the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Also, the present invention proposes a scheme for reliable signal<br>
transmission and reception between the BS and the MS through realtime request<br>
for change of the DIUC from the MS to the BS, when Carrier to Interference<br>
and Noise Ratio(CINR) value of a reference signal, e.g., the pilot channel signal,<br>
measured while the MS is in the sleep interval becomes smaller than the CINR<br>
value of the reference signal measured before the MS entered the sleep mode in<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system is a BWA communication<br>
system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme<br>
and an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme, in<br>
which physical channel signals are transmitted by a plurality of sub-carriers to<br>
achieve high speed data transmission and a multi-cell structure is used to support<br>
the mobility of the MS. Although the IEEE 802.16e communication system is<br>
used herein as an embodiment of the present invention, it noted that the present<br>
invention can be applied to any communication system supporting a sleep mode<br>
operation.<br>
FIG. 3 schematically illustrates an operation of an MS when a DCD<br>
message changes while the MS operates in a sleep mode in an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As described in FIGs. 1 and 2, the MS and the BS set up protocols about<br>
transmissible and receivable modulation schemes and coding schemes in advance<br>
for signal transmission/reception between them. The setup of protocols about the<br>
modulation schemes and coding schemes is achieved through transmission and<br><br>
reception of the downlink burst profile, i.e., transmission and reception of the<br>
DCD message. Further, it is necessary to prepare protocols about the modulation<br>
schemes and coding schemes between the BS and the MS, in order to enable the<br>
MS to normally restart data transmission and reception after awakening from the<br>
sleep mode. However, because the MS does not receive any signal from the BS at<br>
all during the sleep interval in which the MS stays in the sleep mode, the MS<br>
cannot recognize any change in the downlink burst profile, i.e., DIUC set, made<br>
by the BS in the sleep interval. When the DIUCs used by the MS and the BS no<br>
longer coincide due to the sleep mode operation of the MS, it is not possible to<br>
transmit and receive data between the MS and the BS.<br>
That is, when the DCD message changes while the MS performs a sleep<br>
mode operation, i.e., the MS is in the sleep interval, the MS detects the DCD<br>
count included in the currently received DL_MAP message and compares the<br>
detected value with the DCD count value currently stored in the MS itself in the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system. If the DCD count value included in the<br>
DLMAP message currently received by the MS and the DCD count value<br>
currently stored in the MS are different, the MS recognizes the change of the<br>
DCD message. That is, because the DCD count values are different, the version<br>
numbers of the downlink burst profiles are different. Therefore, the MS<br>
recognizes the version number of the downlink burst profile using the DCD count<br>
value.<br>
As described above, in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system,<br>
it is impossible to notify the change in the downlink burst profile to the MS that<br>
has awakened from the sleep mode. Therefore, if the BS transmits downlink data<br>
to the MS using the downlink burst profile of the BS itself, without recognizing<br>
that the downlink burst profile of the BS is different from the downlink burst<br>
profile stored in the MS, the MS cannot normally receive the downlink data from<br>
the BS.<br>
Therefore, the present invention proposes a scheme for data transmission<br>
and reception between the MS and the BS using a DIUC that is updated to be the<br>
same when the DCD message changes, which will be described hereinafter with<br>
reference to FIG. 3.<br>
First, however, it is noted that FIG. 3 is based on an assumption that the<br>
parameter denoting the DCD count value managed by the BS 300 is N, the<br>
parameter denoting the DCD count value managed by the MS 350 is M, and the<br><br>
two parameters N and M have an initial value of '0'. When the BS 300 detects<br>
that it is necessary to change the downlink burst profile while the MS 350 is in<br>
the sleep mode, i.e., during a sleep interval, the BS updates the DCD count value<br>
N, which is managed by the BS 300, to T (N=1) in step 311 and transmits the<br>
changed DCD message in step 313. Although the BS 300 transmitted the changed<br>
DCD message, the MS 350 in the sleep interval cannot recognize the change of<br>
the DCD message. Therefore, the MS 350 maintains the value '0' of the<br>
parameter M (M^O) denoting the DCD count value, which is managed by the MS<br>
350, in step 315.<br>
When the sleep interval terminates, the MS 350 receives the DL_MAP<br>
message from the BS 300 in the listening interval in step 317. In the DL_MAP<br>
message, the DCD count value, more specifically, the value of the parameter N<br>
representing the DCD count value, which is managed by the BS 300, is set as ' 1'.<br>
Therefore, the MS 350 recognizes from the DCD count value that it is necessary<br>
to receive a new DCD message from the BS 300.<br>
After the listening interval terminates, the MS 300 transitions to the<br>
awake mode and waits for the DCD message in step 319. When the BS 300<br>
detects data targeting the MS 350, while the MS 350 is in the awake mode, the BS<br>
300 transmits to the MS 350 a TRF_IND message indicating that there is data to<br>
be transmitted targeting the MS 350, i.e. a TRF_IND message in which a bit<br>
representing the MS 350 in a sleep identifier bitmap is marked by a positive value,<br>
i.e., '1', in step 321.<br>
After receiving the TRF_IND message, the MS 350 reports to the BS 300<br>
that it has recognized the change of the DCD message, i.e., the change of the<br>
DCD count value, in step 323. In this step, the MS 350 uses a Medium Access<br>
Control (MAC) header message in reporting the change of the DCD count value<br>
to the BS 300. The operation for reporting the change of the DCD count value by<br>
the MS 350 will be described later in more detail.<br>
Upon receiving the report about the change of the DCD count value from<br>
the MS 350, the BS recognizes that the MS 350 still applies the DCD message<br>
before the change, i.e., the DCD message having a DCD count value of '0', and<br>
the BS then selects one of the two following schemes in order to solve the<br>
problem due to the difference between the DCD count values of the BS 300 and<br>
the MS 350. That is, in order to prevent abnormal data transmission and reception<br>
due to the difference between the DIUC values the BS then selects one of the two<br><br>
following schemes in step 325. Thereafter, the BS 300 transmits data to the MS<br>
350 by using the selected scheme in step 327.<br>
In a first scheme, the BS 300 holds data transmission to the MS 350, until<br>
the MS 350 receives the new DCD message, i.e., until the BS 300 broadcasts the<br>
new DCD message, after receiving the report about the change of the DCD count<br>
value. That is, according to the first scheme, the BS 300, having received the new<br>
DCD message, performs data transmission and reception after updating the DIUC<br>
of the MS 350 to be the same as that of the BS 300.<br>
According to a second scheme, the BS 300 performs data transmission<br>
and reception by applying the DCD count value currently stored in the MS 350,<br>
i.e., by using a DIUC corresponding to the DCD count value currently stored in<br>
the MS 350. FIG. 3 illustrates a case in which the BS 300 transmits data to the MS<br>
350 according to the second scheme.<br>
The second case in which the MS and the BS use different DIUCs due to<br>
the sleep mode operation of the MS corresponds to when the MS changes the<br>
DIUC value to be proper for the itself in the sleep mode operation, i.e., while the<br>
MS is in the sleep interval.<br>
When the MS moves while it is in the sleep interval or when the<br>
surrounding channel conditions of the MS change to make the CINR value of the<br>
pilot channel signal from the BS differ from that before the MS entered into the<br>
sleep mode, the MS changes the DIUC value to be proper for the MS itself. For<br>
example, when the CINR value of the pilot channel signal measured while the<br>
MS is in the sleep interval becomes smaller than the CINR value of the pilot<br>
channel signal measured before the MS entered into the sleep interval, if the MS<br>
transmits data to the BS using the existing DIUC value without an update, it is<br>
highly possible that the data transmitted by the MS has an error. Therefore, the<br>
present invention enables the MS to request an update of the DIUC of the MS,<br>
even when the MS is in the sleep mode, in order to match the DIUC of the MS<br>
and the BS, thereby enabling a normal data transmission and reception.<br>
More specifically, according to the present invention, a MAC header<br>
message reporting change of the DCD count value is used to request the update of<br>
the DIUC of the MS. A MAC header message for reporting a change of the DCD<br>
count value and requesting change of the DIUC value of the MS will be described<br>
in more detail herein below.<br><br>
First, the MAC header message proposed by the present invention for<br>
reporting a change of the DCD count value and requesting the update of the<br>
DIUC of the MS is determined as one of the following three types.<br>
The first type of MAC header message is a message generated based on<br>
the MAC header message used in the current IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system. The first type of MAC header message reports the change in the DCD<br>
count value using the two unused and reserved bits in the MAC header message,<br>
i.e., physical (PHY) channel report header, of the current IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system. The first type of MAC header message has a format as<br>
shown in Table 2 below.<br><br>
As noted from Table 2, all fields except for the DCD CHANGE COUNT<br>
LSB (Least Significant Bit) field in the first type of MAC header message are the<br>
same as the fields of the PHY channel report header message of the current IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. In Table 2, 'HT' is a field indicating the header<br>
type, 'EC is a field indicating the Encryption control and always has a value of<br>
'0' in the PHY channel report header message, and 'TYPE' is a field indicating<br>
the type of the currently transmitted MAC header message. When 'TYPE' is<br>
marked by '010', it implies that the MAC header message is the PHY channel<br>
report header message.<br>
In Table 2, 'PREFERENCE-DIUC is a field indicating the DIUC value<br>
requested by the MS, 'UL-TX-POWER' is a field indicating extra transmit power<br>
available for the MS, 'DCD CHANGE COUNT LSB' is a field indicating an LSB<br>
of the count value of the changed DCD message, 'CID' indicates the basic<br>
connection identifier of the MS, and 'HCS' is a field indicating the header check<br>
sequence.<br>
The first type MAC header message is a MAC header message generated<br>
by changing the reserved bits of the PHY channel report header message of the<br>
current IEEE 802.16e communication system into the field 'DCD CHANGE<br><br>
LSB', which reports the change of the DCD count value. The two reserved bits<br>
currently unused in the PHY channel report header message of the current IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system are used as two LSB bits of the DCD count<br>
defining the DIUC (PREFERENC-DIUC) requested by the MS in the first type<br>
MAC header message. The first type MAC header message includes both<br>
'PREFERENC-DIUC and 'DCD CHANGE COUNT LSB' by which the MS can<br>
report the change of the DCD count and the change of the DIUC to the BS.<br>
The second type of MAC header message is the 'Bandwidth Request and<br>
Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header' message, which is a newly<br>
generated message in order to report the change of the DCD count value and<br>
request the change of the DIUC of the MS.<br>
The second type of MAC header message has a format as shown in Table<br>
3 below.<br><br>
In Table 3, the 'HT', 'EC, 'HCS', and 'CID' fields of the second type<br>
MAC header message are the same as the 'HT', 'EC, 'HCS', and 'CID' fields of<br>
the first type MAC header message as shown in Table 2, so repetition of the<br>
description about them will be avoided.<br>
In Table 3, 'TYPE' is a field indicating the type of the currently<br>
transmitted MAC header message. When 'TYPE' is marked by '100', it implies<br>
that the MAC header message is the Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst<br>
Profile Change Request Header message. Further, the 'BR' field indicates the<br>
bandwidth requested by the MS, which has a value of '0' when there is no data,<br>
which the MS must transmit through the uplink. The 'Requested Downlink Burst<br>
Profile' field has a length of 8 bits, among which four bits from the 0th bit to the<br>
3 rd bit represent the DIUC value requested by the MS and four bits from the 4th bit<br>
to the 7th bit represent the four LSB bits of the DlUC-defming DCD count<br>
requested by the MS. The 'Requested Downlink Burst Profile' has a format as<br>
shown in Table 4 below.<br>
Table 4<br><br><br>
The second type MAC header message includes the 'Requested<br>
Downlink Burst Profile' field by which the MS can report the change of the DCD<br>
count and the change of the DIUC to the BS.<br>
The third type of MAC header message is the 'Bandwidth Request and<br>
Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header' message, which is a newly<br>
generated message in order to report the change of the DCD count value and<br>
request the change of the DIUC of the MS.<br>
The third type of MAC header message has a format as shown in Table 5<br>
below.<br><br>
In table 5, the 'HT', 'EC, 'HCS', and 'CID' fields of the third type MAC<br>
header message as shown in Table 5 are the same as the 'HT', 'EC, 'HCS', and<br>
'CID' fields of the first type MAC header message as shown in Table 2, so<br>
repetition of the description about them will be avoided.<br>
In Table 5, 'TYPE' is a field indicating the type of the currently<br>
transmitted MAC header message. When 'TYPE' is marked by '100', it implies<br>
that the MAC header message is the Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst<br>
Profile Change Request Header message. Although the message types of the<br>
second type MAC header message and the third type MAC header message may<br>
be different from each other, they are set as the same in the present embodiment<br><br>
for ensuring clarity and convenience for the description.<br>
In Table 5, the 'BR' field indicates the bandwidth requested by the MS,<br>
which has a value of '0' when there is no data, which the MS must transmit<br>
through the uplink. Further, the 'CINR' field indicates a CINR of a downlink<br>
signal, e.g., a pilot channel signal, received by the MS, and the 'DCD Change<br>
Indication' field indicates if the DCD count has changed.<br>
As shown in Table 5, the third type MAC header message has a format<br>
similar to that of the second type MAC header message. That is, same as the<br>
second type MAC header message, the third type MAC header message is a<br>
message indicating Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change<br>
Request. However, the second type MAC header message and the third type<br>
MAC header message are different in the process of requesting the change of the<br>
downlink burst profile.<br>
Hereinafter, the ways in which the second type MAC header message and<br>
the third type MAC header message request the change of the downlink burst<br>
profile will be described.<br>
First, the second type MAC header message is used by the MS, which<br>
directly requests allocation of a DIUC value that is proper for the MS from the BS,<br>
in order to change the DIUC value when movement of the MS during the sleep<br>
interval or change of surrounding channel conditions causes the CINR of the pilot<br>
channel signal from the BS to become different from the CINR before the<br>
transition of the MS into the sleep mode. Therefore, in the second type MAC<br>
header message, the four bits from the 0th bit to the 3rd bit from among the eight<br>
bits of the 'Requested Downlink Burst Profile' field are used in order to express<br>
the DIUC value requested by the MS.<br>
In contrast, the third type MAC header message is used by the MS in<br>
order to request allocation of a DIUC value proper for the MS by reporting a<br>
CINR of a received pilot channel signal, instead of being used by the MS, which<br>
directly requests allocation of a DIUC value that is proper for the MS from the BS,<br>
in order to change the DIUC value when movement of the MS during the sleep<br>
interval or change of surrounding channel conditions causes the CINR of the pilot<br>
channel signal from the BS to become different from the CINR before the<br>
transition of the MS into the sleep mode. Therefore, the third type MAC header<br>
message includes the CINR field for reporting the CINR of the pilot channel<br><br>
signal received by the MS. In order to report the channel quality of the MS, the<br>
third type MAC header message may include the CINR and also other<br>
information capable of expressing the channel quality of the MS.<br>
Further, in order to report the change of the DCD count value, the second<br>
type MAC header message directly transmits the DCD count value stored in the<br>
MS to the BS using the four bits from the 4th bit to the 7th bit from among the<br>
eight bits of the 'Requested Downlink Burst Profile' field.<br>
In contrast, the third type MAC header message uses a DCD change<br>
indication field in order to express the change of the DCD count value. That is,<br>
when the DCD count value currently stored in the MS is different from the DCD<br>
count value received by the MS in the listening interval, the value of the DCD<br>
change indication field is set as T. When the DCD count value currently stored<br>
in the MS is equal to the DCD count value received by the MS in the listening<br>
interval, the value of the DCD change indication field is set as '0'. Therefore, the<br>
BS can recognize if the DCD count value has changed from the value of the DCD<br>
change indication field of the third type MAC header message.<br>
The time point at which the third type MAC header message is<br>
transmitted is to the same as the time point at which the first type MAC header<br>
message and second type MAC header message are transmitted. That is, when the<br>
DCD count value currently stored in the MS is different from the DCD count<br>
value of the DCD message received by the MS in the listening interval or when it<br>
is necessary to change the DIUC value due to the change of the CINR of the<br>
downlink signal received by the MS, the MS transmits the third type MAC header<br>
message.<br>
Further, even when the DCD count value currently stored in the MS is<br>
equal to the DCD count value of the DCD message received by the MS in the<br>
listening interval and it is unnecessary to change the DIUC value in consideration<br>
of the CINR of the downlink signal received by the MS, the MS may use the third<br>
type MAC header message for confirmation of the TRF_IND message.<br>
When the MS reports its CINR value through the third type MAC header<br>
message to the BS, the BS determines the DIUC value proper for the MS in<br>
accordance with the CINR value of the MS. The process in which the BS<br>
determines the DIUC value proper for the MS in accordance with the CINR value<br>
of the MS will not be described here, because it has no direct relation to the<br><br>
present invention.<br>
Further, when the MS reports a change of the DCD count value through<br>
the third type MAC header message to the BS, that is, when the MS transmits the<br>
third type MAC header message containing a DCD change indication field having<br>
a value set as '1', the BS holds transmission of traffic data targeting the MS until<br>
the MS receives a DCD message corresponding to the changed DCD count value,<br>
that is, until the BS retransmits the DCD message corresponding to the changed<br>
DCD count value.<br>
Also, even before the BS retransmits the DCD message corresponding to<br>
the changed DCD count value, if the BS has continuously managed and<br>
recognizes the DCD count value of the DCD message stored in the MS, the BS<br>
may transmit the traffic data targeting the MS using the DIUC defined in the<br>
DCD message corresponding to the DCD count value stored in the MS.<br>
Accordingly, different from the first type MAC header message and the<br>
second type MAC header message, the third type MAC header message enables<br>
the MS to directly report the received CINR of the downlink signal to the BS.<br>
Therefore, the BS can exactly determine the DIUC for the MS and also the<br>
quantity of power to be transmitted to the MS, the number of repetition of data<br>
coding, etc.<br>
Hereinafter, the MAC header messages newly proposed by the present<br>
invention, including the first type MAC header message as shown in Table 2, i.e.,<br>
a message created by modifying the PHY channel report header message used in<br>
the current IEEE 802.16e communication system, the second type MAC header<br>
message, and the third type MAC headers message will be compared with each<br>
other.<br>
The first type MAC header message is advantageous in that it is a reused<br>
message that is created by modifying the PHY channel report header message<br>
used in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system. However, while the<br>
first type MAC header message can transmit 2 LSB bits of the DCD count, the<br>
second type MAC header message can transmit 4 LSB bits of the DCD count.<br>
Therefore, the second type MAC header message is more proper than the first<br>
type MAC header message, when the MS stays in the sleep mode for relatively<br>
long time and the DCD message changes relatively frequently.<br><br>
Further, the second type MAC header message and the third type MAC<br>
header message can be used to simultaneously perform a downlink burst profile<br>
change confirmation and bandwidth allocation request. That is, even while the<br>
MS is in the sleep mode, the MS can request a bandwidth request through an<br>
uplink to the BS if a data to be transmitted to the BS occurs. Then, the MS can<br>
simultaneously perform downlink burst profile change confirmation and<br>
bandwidth allocation request using the second type MAC header message and the<br>
third type MAC header message. By simultaneously performing a downlink burst<br>
profile change confirmation and bandwidth allocation request, it is possible to<br>
minimize the uplink signaling load.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an operation process by an MS in an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
As described above, the second type MAC header message and the third<br>
type MAC header message are similar in their functions, that is, they are both<br>
'Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header'<br>
messages. Therefore, it should be noted that one of the second type MAC header<br>
message and the third type MAC header message can be selectively used as the<br>
'Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header'<br>
message in the following description of FIG. 4.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, while the MS is in the sleep mode in step 411, the<br>
MS checks if the sleep interval terminates in step 413. When the sleep interval<br>
has not terminated yet, the MS remains in the sleep interval in step 411.<br>
When the sleep interval ends, the MS enters into a listening interval. In<br>
step 415, the MS receives a pilot channel signal from a serving BS, measures a<br>
CINR of the pilot channel signal, and determines from the measured CINR if it is<br>
necessary to change the DIUC of the MS itself.<br>
In step 417, the MS compares the DCD count value of the DL_MAP<br>
message from the BS with the DCD count value stored in the MS and determines<br>
if the DCD count value has changed. In step 419, the MS receives a TRF_IND<br>
message from the BS and checks if the bit for the MS in the sleep identifier<br>
bitmap of the received TRF_IND message is marked by a value representing a<br>
positive indication, i.e., '1'. When the bit is not marked by '1', the MS returns to<br>
step 411.<br><br>
As a result of the checking in step 419, when the bit is marked by ' 1', the<br>
MS checks if the MS has been allocated an uplink bandwidth in step 421. The MS<br>
proceeds to step 423, when the MS has been allocated an uplink bandwidth, and<br>
proceeds to step 429, when the MS has not been allocated an uplink bandwidth.<br>
In step 423, the MS checks if it is necessary to report change of the DCD<br>
count value or request change of the DIUC. When it is necessary to report change<br>
of the DCD count value or request change of the DIUC, the MS selects one MAC<br>
header message from among the first type MAC header message, i.e., PHY<br>
channel report header message, and the second and third type MAC header<br>
messages, i.e., Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request<br>
Header messages, reports change of the DCD count value or requests change of<br>
the DIUC by using the selected message in step 425. In step 425, the MS obeys<br>
the determination of the IEEE 802.16e communication system in selecting one<br>
MAC header message from among the first, second, and third type MAC header<br>
messages.<br>
When it is unnecessary to report change of the DCD count value and<br>
request change of the DIUC, the MS may transmit the 'Bandwidth Request and<br>
Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header' message instead of the<br>
'Bandwidth Request Header' message after setting the 'BR' field of the<br>
Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header message<br>
as '0' in step 427.<br>
In step 429, the MS transits from the sleep mode to an awake mode and<br>
then performs a normal operation.<br>
As described above, the second type MAC header message and the third<br>
type MAC header message are similar in their functions, that is, they are<br>
'Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header'<br>
messages. Therefore, it should be noted that one of the second type MAC header<br>
message and the third type MAC header message can be selectively used as the<br>
'Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header'<br>
message in the following description with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an operation process by a BS in an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, while a corresponding MS controlled by the BS is in the sleep<br>
mode in step 511, the BS checks if the sleep interval of the corresponding MS<br><br>
terminates in step 513. When the sleep interval has not terminated yet, the BS<br>
returns to step 511.<br>
When the sleep interval of the MS has terminated, the BS proceeds enters<br>
a listening interval. In step 515, the BS inspects if data targeting the<br>
corresponding MS, i.e., data to be transmitted to the MS, is stored in a buffer.<br>
When there is no data to be transmitted to the MS, the BS proceeds to step 517.<br>
In step 517, the BS transmits a TRF_IND message after marking the bit<br>
for the corresponding MS in the sleep identifier bitmap of the TRF_IND message<br>
by a value representing a negative indication, i.e., '0', and then proceeds to step<br>
519. In step 519, the BS updates the sleep interval of the corresponding MS, and<br>
in step 521, the BS controls the MS in the sleep mode based on the updated sleep<br>
interval.<br>
As a result of the inspection in step 515, when there is data to be<br>
transmitted to the MS, the BS transmits a TRF_IND message after marking the bit<br>
for the corresponding MS in the sleep identifier bitmap of the TRF_IND message<br>
by a value representing a positive indication, i.e., ' 1', in step 523.<br>
In step 525, the BS allocates an uplink bandwidth to the corresponding<br>
MS, and receives through the allocated uplink bandwidth one MAC header<br>
message from among the first type MAC header message, i.e., PHY channel<br>
report header message, and the second and third type MAC header messages, i.e.,<br>
Bandwidth Request and Downlink Burst Profile Change Request Header<br>
messages. In step 525, the BS obeys the determination of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system in receiving one of the first, second, and third type MAC<br>
header messages.<br>
In step 527, the BS determines, based on an analysis of the first, second,<br>
or third type MAC header message received from the MS, if there is a DCD count<br>
value change report or a DIUC change request. When there is a DIUC change<br>
request, the BS changes the DIUC according to the request of the MS in step<br>
529.<br>
As a result of the determination in step 527, when there is a DCD count<br>
value change report, the BS transmits a data to MS based on the DIUC of the<br>
downlink burst profile of the DCD message corresponding to the DCD count<br>
value currently stored in the MS or holds the data transmission until the BS<br><br>
transmits the DCD message to the MS in step 531.<br>
When there is neither a DCD count value change report nor a DIUC<br>
change request as a result of the determination in step 527, the BS proceeds<br>
directly to step 533.<br>
In step 533, the BS controls the MS to transit into an awake mode and<br>
then terminates the process.<br>
According to the present invention, when a DCD message changes, i.e.,<br>
when a downlink burst profile changes, in a sleep mode of a broadband wireless<br>
access communication system using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme, e.g., an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system, or when it is necessary to change the DIUC of<br>
the MS due to the change in the CINR of the MS, the MS reports the change of<br>
the DCD message and requests the change of the DIUC from the BS, in order for<br>
the BS and the MS to transmit and receive data with the same DIUC, thereby<br>
maximizing the transmission efficiency.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
