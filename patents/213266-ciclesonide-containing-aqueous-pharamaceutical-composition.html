3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
CICLESONIDE-CONTAININGAOUEOUS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a ciclesonidecontaining aqueous pharmaceutical composition for use in drug therapy that contains ciclesonide and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, wherein said ciclesonide is dispersed in an aqueous medium in the form of solid particles. More particularly, the present invention relates to a ciclesonide-containing aqueous pharmaceutical composition having excellent ciclesonide dispersivity during production as compared    with    conventional    aqueous    pharmaceutical    compositions.<br>
Background Art<br>
Ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical compositions containing ciclesonide dispersed in an aqueous medium in a form of solid particles are expected to represent a useful drug form for reasons that include 1) it is not necessary to completely dissolve ciclesonide, 2) it can be directly administered to an affected site by spraying and so forth for treatment of local diseases such as those of the nasal mucosa, eyes and epidermis, and 3) they are easier to swallow than tablets or granule and so forth.<br>
When present in an aqueous medium, ciclesonide is resistant to wetting and easily aggregates. The addition of wetting agent such as Polysorbate 80 and powerful stirring and so forth during production have been used in the prior art for the purpose of dispersing drug having such properties in an aqueous medium in a stable state.<br>
Improvement of drug dispersivity of aqueous pharmaceutical compositions containing a drug dispersed in an aqueous medium in form of solid particles<br>
2<br><br>
by addition of cellulose-based polymer is disclosed inMorishima etal. patent specification ofw099-37286.<br>
However, this patent relates to the redispersion of a drug that has settled during storage, and is fundamentally different from the present invention which relates to overcoming drawbacks of the migration of ciclesonide towards bubbles formed by powerful stirring during the production, and the adsorption of ciclesonide to the walls of the production apparatus. Moreover, the concentration of the cellulose-based polymer in the patent specification of Morishima et al. is 0.0001 to 0.003%, and methylcellulose can be used in place of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose for the cellulose-based polymer, while the addition of a nonionic surfactant is also required. It is not easy to deduce the present invention from this patent in which the optimum value of the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose concentration is from 0.01% w/w to 0.5% w/w, and does not require a surfactant. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
During the course of production of ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical compositions, high shearing force is required to disperse ciclesonide and it is necessary to powerfully stir ciclesonide-containing aqueous pharmaceutical composition. Ciclesonide migrates to the bubbles formed at this time. Since this results in an increased concentration of ciclesonide in the upper portion of the ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical composition being higher than that in the lower portion, variation occurs in the ciclesonide concentration of ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical compositions produced.<br>
Moreover, the recovery rate decreases due to adsorption of ciclesonide to the walls and so forth of the production apparatus.<br>
These variations in ciclesonide concentration and adsorption of ciclesonide to the production apparatus were hardly improved at all by the addition of wetting agents such as Polysorbate 80 that have been used in the prior art.<br>
3<br><br>
Conversely, the amount of formed bubbles increases resulting in promotion oi further variation in ciclesonide concentration.<br>
Therefore, there is a considerable need for the development of a ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical composition that is able to avoid variations ir ciclesonide concentrations during production as well as the decrease ir ciclesonide recovery rate.<br>
Namely, the object of the present invention is to provide a ciclesonidt aqueous pharmaceutical composition that avoids variations in ciclesonidt concentration during production as well as decreases in the ciclesonidt recovery rate.<br>
As a result of earnest studies to solve the above problems, the inventors of tht present invention found that a ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutica composition can be provided that avoids variations in ciclesonide concentrations during production as well as decreases in the ciclesonide recovery rate, by using a ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical composition containing ciclesonide and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.<br>
Namely, the present invention relates to an aqueous pharmaceutical composition containing ciclesonide and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, wherein said ciclesonide is dispersed in an aqueous medium in form of solid particles.<br>

Examples<br>
The following provides an explanation of the present invention through its<br>
Examples.<br><br>
Ciclesonide used in the present invention was manufactured by Byk Gulden Co., the crystalline cellulose carmellose sodium by Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.<br>
(Avice 1 Tm RC-A591NF), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910 by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.(TC-5RWM or Metrose60SH-4000TM), Polysorbate 80 by Nippon Surfactant Co.,Ltd., and the sorbitan trioleate by Nikko Chemical Co., Ltd.ROBOMICS'M manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd. was used for the homomixer.<br>

upper and lower portions of the emulsification tank, followed by<br>
quantification	of	the	ciclesonide	concentrations	by<br>
HPLC. The value for the upper portion of the emulsification tank was calculated by taking the ciclesonide concentration in the lower portion of the emulsification tank to bel00%.<br>
Subsequently, the ciclesonide concentrations of the ciclesonide aqueous pharmaceutical compositions recovered from the emulsification tank were quantified by HPLC, and the ciclesonide recovery rates were determined based on the theoretical value of the ciclesonide concentration as calculated from the charged amount.<br>
Those values are shown in Table 1.<br>

Comparative Example 1	Composition 6	131.1	100.0	78.2<br><br>
	Composition 7	438.7	100.0	43.0<br>
In the case of compositions 2,3 and 5, which contained 0.1 tol% w/w of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910, the ciclesonide concentrations in the emulsification tank immediately after homomixer processing were uniform, and the recovery rates were almostl00%. In addition, in the case of compositions 1 and 4, which contained 0.01% w/w of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910, although the ciclesonide concentrations in the emulsification tank immediately after homomixer processing were somewhat nonuniform, the recovery rates were almostl00%. In contrast, in the case of composition 6, which contained 0.1% w/w of Polysorbate 80, the ciclesonide concentration in the upper portion of the emulsification tank immediately after homomixer processing was more than30% higher than in the lower portion. In addition, the recovery rate decreased by about20%. In -the case of composition 7, which contained 0.1% w/w of sorbitan trioleate, the ciclesonide concentration in the upper portion of the emulsification tank immediately after homomixer processing was more than40% higher than in<br>
11<br><br>
the lower portion, and the recovery rate decreased by more than half.<br>
Based on these results, it was determined that the use of a composition containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose made it possible to avoid variation in the concentration of ciclesonide during production as well as avoid a decrease in the recovery rate of ciclesonide.<br>
