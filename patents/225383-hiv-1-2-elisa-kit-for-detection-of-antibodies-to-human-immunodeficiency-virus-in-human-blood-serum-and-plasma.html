AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF SEVELAMER<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Hyperphosphatemia is a disease associated with acute and chronic renal failure and occurs when the serum phosphorus level is greater than 5 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L), usually in the form of inorganic phosphorus. Hyperphosphatemia involves decreased Ca++ due to increased sperm phosphorus, increased parathyroid hormone secretion, and associated sequelae (Ref: http://www.phosphoruscontrol.com/HY/Default.aspx).<br>
Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include dialysis, dietary phosphate reduction, and oral administration of insoluble phosphate-binding agents. As dialysis and dietary phosphate reduction alone is not able to sufficiently maintain normal phosphorus level in hyperphosphatemia! patients, a combination of therapies must be used such as use of one or more phosphate binders, which is routinely used to treat these patients (Ref: US 5 496 545 A).<br>
Phosphate binding agents act to reduce serum phosphorus ingested through the diet and include calcium, aluminium and magnesium salts or organic polymers such as poly (allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride.<br>
Calcium based phosphate binders have been widely used to bind intestinal phosphate and prevent absorption. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are the most commonly used calcium based phosphate binders, although calcium citrate, ketovalin, and alginate are also available. The ingested calcium combines with phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate salts. Side effects associated with these agents limit their effectiveness. The major side effect of this therapy is hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia causes serious side effects such as renal failure, confusion etc. Treatment with calcium base phosphate binders requires frequent monitoring of serum calcium level (Ref: US 5 496 545 A; http://www.phosphoruscontrol.com/PH/CalciumBasedBinders.aspx).<br>
Aluminum is also an effective phosphate binder and is administered in the form of aluminum hydroxide, Al (OH) 3 gel and marketed as "Amphojel®". These compounds form complex with intestinal phosphate, to form highly insoluble aluminium phosphate. Prolong use of<br><br><br>
these gels may lead to aluminum toxicity accompanied by symptoms such as myopathy, severe bone disease and anemia (Ref: US 5 496 545 A and http://www.phosphoruscontrol.com/PH/AluminumBasedBinders.aspx).<br>
Magnesium salts are also known to work as phosphate binder however; they are rarely used because of risk of hypomagnesaemia in renal failure.<br>
Organic polymers are also used as phosphate binders. The said organic polymers are, for example the ion exchange resins like Dowex®, XF43311 etc. These resins have several drawbacks like need for high dosage, poor binding capacity etc. (Ref: US 5 496 545 A).<br>
Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride is one of the therapeutic drug used for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. It is a copolymer of allylamine and epichlorohydrin, which is a phosphate binder used to reduce the absorption of dietary phosphate. It is used to reduce the serum phosphorus in patients with severe kidney disease known as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).<br>
Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride is marketed by Geltex Pharmaceuticals after USFDA approved the active ingredient in October 1998 for the treatment of high level of serum phosphorus in patients with end-stage renal disease. This active ingredient, which is both calcium-free and aluminum-free, enables the fast treatment of hyperphosphatemia without the risks associated with other treatments. Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride treatment also results in a lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum cholesterol levels. (Ref: http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru640.html) and label information of poly(allylamine-co-N, N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride, available on USFDA website).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane)hydrochloride of formula (I) is a poly(allylamine hydrochloride) cross-linked with epichlorohydrin in which 40% amines are protonated.<br>
3<br><br><br><br><br><br>
mixture was quenched with methanol. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) was isolated by filtration and dried at 50°C under reduced pressure.<br>
An aqueous solution of polyallylamine was prepared by neutralizing compound of formula<br>
(III)	with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Epichlorohydrin (IV) was added to an<br>
aqueous solution of polyallylamine and stirred for two minutes. The resulting mixture was<br>
added into a mixture of chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene and Silvan S-83, to obtain a<br>
dispersion, which was allowed to cross-link at 25°C for 30 minutes and at 50°C for 2 hours.<br>
The desired compound was filtered and washed successively with methanol, IN sodium<br>
hydroxide, and D.M water. The compound of formula (I) was then dried under reduced<br>
pressure at 50°C.<br>
The above embodiment for the preparation of compound of formula (I) has the following disadvantages, which are:<br>
a)	isolation of intermediates like monoallylamine hydrochloride of formula (IIA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) makes the process time consuming, lengthy and tedious,<br>
b)	the intermediate (III) was dried under vacuum due to its hygroscopic nature, and this step utilizes more utility and time,<br>
c)	the process for the preparation of compound (I) utilizes Class 2 solvents such as chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene for the reaction, which in turn makes the process hazardous for human health and environment, and<br>
d)	the above process also requires a dispersion stabilizer like Silvan S-83, which makes the process uneconomical.<br>
US 2004/0028803 Al discloses synthesis of compound of formula (I) in the form of gel, comprising reaction of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (III) with epichlorohydrin of formula<br>
(IV)	in an aqueous solution, at a pH between 10.0 and 10.4 adjusted by addition of 50%<br>
caustic lye, and maintaining the temperature between 5°C to 10°C followed by a process of<br>
gelling for 24 hours.<br>

Scheme-2: Method as disclosed in US 5 496 545 for preparation of compound of formula<br>
(I)-<br>
The method disclosed in US 5 496 545 for preparation of compound of formula (I) comprises of two steps:<br>
i) reacting allylamine (II) with concentrated hydrochloric acid in aqueous medium to form allylamine hydrochloride (IIA), followed by removal of water by vacuum distillation at 60°C-70°C,<br>
ii) adding the catalyst azobis(amidinopropane) dihydrochloride in two lots and stirring the reaction for 24 hours and 44 hours respectively, after the addition of each lot, to form poly (allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III),<br>
iii) separating out compound (III) after quenching with methanol, followed by filtering and leaching with methanol repeatedly, and<br>
iv)      reacting epichlorohydrin (IV) with compound (III) in an aqueous medium, by adjusting pH 10 with solid sodium hydroxide and curing for 18 hours, followed by quenching with isopropanol to give compound of formula (I), which was vacuum dried for 18 hours.<br>
The above process also has several drawbacks like:<br>
a)	water has to be removed under vacuum during the preparation of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III). Removal of water by distillation consumes lot of energy, which makes the process cumbersome, time consuming and tedious on commercial scale,<br>
b)	due to hygroscopic nature of the intermediate of formula (III), the filtration has to be carried out under stringent conditions,<br>
c)	further, there is a danger of loss in yield during filtration and leaching, which is done repeatedly. Repeated methanol washing and filtration generates large quantity of effluent, that has to be either recycled by distillation or disposed in the effluent treatment plant.<br><br>
US 6,290,947 (assigned to Geltex Pharmaceuticals) discloses the preparation of compound of formula (I) comprising reaction of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) in an aqueous medium, at a pH of 10.5 with solid sodium hydroxide, until homogenous mixture was formed. Reaction with epichlorohydrin of formula (IV) was carried out at a pH of 10.2 (Ref: Example 5 of US 6 290 945) and the reaction mixture cured for 18 hours to provide a gel, which is broken up with Kitchen Aid Mixer. Further, washings are given until the conductivity of the effluent was equal to 16.7 mS/cm. The co-polymer of formula (I) was air-dried at 60°C for 5 days.<br>
The above process, although it seems to be commercially viable, has some limitations like:<br>
a)	during the process, pH was reduced to a specific range between 10.2 and 10.5. Maintaining pH on a commercial scale, at a precise pH is very tedious. Further, monitoring the sharp pH for a long period is cumbersome.<br>
b)	use of Kitchen Aid Mixer for breaking gel on commercial scale is another limitation.<br>
c)	monitoring the washing process of final gel till the conductivity of effluent equals 16.7 mS/cm is cumbersome, and puts limitation on online quality control, adds additional manpower, requires more analytical instruments.<br>
d)	the final product of formula (I) prepared by this method takes 5 days for drying, thereby increasing the time cycle for each run. This increases drier occupancy and utility for a longer time, thereby, making the process uneconomical.<br>
US 6 525 113 discloses the preparation of Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride of formula (I) comprising reaction of an aqueous solution of Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) in presence of sodium hydroxide, with epichlorohydrin of formula (IV) at temperature between 20°C to 30°C. The reaction was carried out in a water-miscible solvent like acetonitrile.<br>
It should be noted that this method also utilizes a Class 2 solvent like acetonitrile (methyl cyanide), which has got quite a low exposure limit of 410 ppm. Utilization of such a hazardous cyanide solvent on an industrial scale makes the process environmentally dangerous and less feasible.<br>
9<br><br>
Considering all the above shortcomings in the prior art, the applicant has developed a simple and industrially viable process for the preparation of compound of formula (I), which is one-pot reaction, avoiding isolation of compound of formula (III). The method embodied in this invention reduces the time cycle for each batch run, reduces cost, efforts and thereby, makes the process commercially viable.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide simple and cost effective process for the preparation of poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride of formula (I)-<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a single-pot process for the preparation of poly (allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride, wherein the overall period for completion of the reaction is reduced, making the process suitable for commercial applications.<br>
Yet, another object is to provide a-process for the preparation of poly(allylamine-co-N, N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride having phosphate binding capacity as per desired specification.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>

AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF SEVELAMER<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Hyperphosphatemia is a disease associated with acute and chronic renal failure and occurs when the serum phosphorus level is greater than 5 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L), usually in the form of inorganic phosphorus. Hyperphosphatemia involves decreased Ca++ due to increased sperm phosphorus, increased parathyroid hormone secretion, and associated sequelae (Ref: http://www.phosphoruscontrol.com/HY/Default.aspx).<br>
Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include dialysis, dietary phosphate reduction, and oral administration of insoluble phosphate-binding agents. As dialysis and dietary phosphate reduction alone is not able to sufficiently maintain normal phosphorus level in hyperphosphatemia! patients, a combination of therapies must be used such as use of one or more phosphate binders, which is routinely used to treat these patients (Ref: US 5 496 545 A).<br>
Phosphate binding agents act to reduce serum phosphorus ingested through the diet and include calcium, aluminium and magnesium salts or organic polymers such as poly (allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride.<br>
Calcium based phosphate binders have been widely used to bind intestinal phosphate and prevent absorption. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are the most commonly used calcium based phosphate binders, although calcium citrate, ketovalin, and alginate are also available. The ingested calcium combines with phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate salts. Side effects associated with these agents limit their effectiveness. The major side effect of this therapy is hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia causes serious side effects such as renal failure, confusion etc. Treatment with calcium base phosphate binders requires frequent monitoring of serum calcium level (Ref: US 5 496 545 A; http://www.phosphoruscontrol.com/PH/CalciumBasedBinders.aspx).<br>
Aluminum is also an effective phosphate binder and is administered in the form of aluminum hydroxide, Al (OH) 3 gel and marketed as "Amphojel®". These compounds form complex with intestinal phosphate, to form highly insoluble aluminium phosphate. Prolong use of<br><br><br>
these gels may lead to aluminum toxicity accompanied by symptoms such as myopathy, severe bone disease and anemia (Ref: US 5 496 545 A and http://www.phosphoruscontrol.com/PH/AluminumBasedBinders.aspx).<br>
Magnesium salts are also known to work as phosphate binder however; they are rarely used because of risk of hypomagnesaemia in renal failure.<br>
Organic polymers are also used as phosphate binders. The said organic polymers are, for example the ion exchange resins like Dowex®, XF43311 etc. These resins have several drawbacks like need for high dosage, poor binding capacity etc. (Ref: US 5 496 545 A).<br>
Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride is one of the therapeutic drug used for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. It is a copolymer of allylamine and epichlorohydrin, which is a phosphate binder used to reduce the absorption of dietary phosphate. It is used to reduce the serum phosphorus in patients with severe kidney disease known as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).<br>
Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride is marketed by Geltex Pharmaceuticals after USFDA approved the active ingredient in October 1998 for the treatment of high level of serum phosphorus in patients with end-stage renal disease. This active ingredient, which is both calcium-free and aluminum-free, enables the fast treatment of hyperphosphatemia without the risks associated with other treatments. Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride treatment also results in a lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum cholesterol levels. (Ref: http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru640.html) and label information of poly(allylamine-co-N, N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride, available on USFDA website).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane)hydrochloride of formula (I) is a poly(allylamine hydrochloride) cross-linked with epichlorohydrin in which 40% amines are protonated.<br>
3<br><br><br><br><br><br>
mixture was quenched with methanol. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) was isolated by filtration and dried at 50°C under reduced pressure.<br>
An aqueous solution of polyallylamine was prepared by neutralizing compound of formula<br>
(III)	with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Epichlorohydrin (IV) was added to an<br>
aqueous solution of polyallylamine and stirred for two minutes. The resulting mixture was<br>
added into a mixture of chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene and Silvan S-83, to obtain a<br>
dispersion, which was allowed to cross-link at 25°C for 30 minutes and at 50°C for 2 hours.<br>
The desired compound was filtered and washed successively with methanol, IN sodium<br>
hydroxide, and D.M water. The compound of formula (I) was then dried under reduced<br>
pressure at 50°C.<br>
The above embodiment for the preparation of compound of formula (I) has the following disadvantages, which are:<br>
a)	isolation of intermediates like monoallylamine hydrochloride of formula (IIA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) makes the process time consuming, lengthy and tedious,<br>
b)	the intermediate (III) was dried under vacuum due to its hygroscopic nature, and this step utilizes more utility and time,<br>
c)	the process for the preparation of compound (I) utilizes Class 2 solvents such as chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene for the reaction, which in turn makes the process hazardous for human health and environment, and<br>
d)	the above process also requires a dispersion stabilizer like Silvan S-83, which makes the process uneconomical.<br>
US 2004/0028803 Al discloses synthesis of compound of formula (I) in the form of gel, comprising reaction of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (III) with epichlorohydrin of formula<br>
(IV)	in an aqueous solution, at a pH between 10.0 and 10.4 adjusted by addition of 50%<br>
caustic lye, and maintaining the temperature between 5°C to 10°C followed by a process of<br>
gelling for 24 hours.<br>

Scheme-2: Method as disclosed in US 5 496 545 for preparation of compound of formula<br>
(I)-<br>
The method disclosed in US 5 496 545 for preparation of compound of formula (I) comprises of two steps:<br>
i) reacting allylamine (II) with concentrated hydrochloric acid in aqueous medium to form allylamine hydrochloride (IIA), followed by removal of water by vacuum distillation at 60°C-70°C,<br>
ii) adding the catalyst azobis(amidinopropane) dihydrochloride in two lots and stirring the reaction for 24 hours and 44 hours respectively, after the addition of each lot, to form poly (allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III),<br>
iii) separating out compound (III) after quenching with methanol, followed by filtering and leaching with methanol repeatedly, and<br>
iv)      reacting epichlorohydrin (IV) with compound (III) in an aqueous medium, by adjusting pH 10 with solid sodium hydroxide and curing for 18 hours, followed by quenching with isopropanol to give compound of formula (I), which was vacuum dried for 18 hours.<br>
The above process also has several drawbacks like:<br>
a)	water has to be removed under vacuum during the preparation of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III). Removal of water by distillation consumes lot of energy, which makes the process cumbersome, time consuming and tedious on commercial scale,<br>
b)	due to hygroscopic nature of the intermediate of formula (III), the filtration has to be carried out under stringent conditions,<br>
c)	further, there is a danger of loss in yield during filtration and leaching, which is done repeatedly. Repeated methanol washing and filtration generates large quantity of effluent, that has to be either recycled by distillation or disposed in the effluent treatment plant.<br><br>
US 6,290,947 (assigned to Geltex Pharmaceuticals) discloses the preparation of compound of formula (I) comprising reaction of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) in an aqueous medium, at a pH of 10.5 with solid sodium hydroxide, until homogenous mixture was formed. Reaction with epichlorohydrin of formula (IV) was carried out at a pH of 10.2 (Ref: Example 5 of US 6 290 945) and the reaction mixture cured for 18 hours to provide a gel, which is broken up with Kitchen Aid Mixer. Further, washings are given until the conductivity of the effluent was equal to 16.7 mS/cm. The co-polymer of formula (I) was air-dried at 60°C for 5 days.<br>
The above process, although it seems to be commercially viable, has some limitations like:<br>
a)	during the process, pH was reduced to a specific range between 10.2 and 10.5. Maintaining pH on a commercial scale, at a precise pH is very tedious. Further, monitoring the sharp pH for a long period is cumbersome.<br>
b)	use of Kitchen Aid Mixer for breaking gel on commercial scale is another limitation.<br>
c)	monitoring the washing process of final gel till the conductivity of effluent equals 16.7 mS/cm is cumbersome, and puts limitation on online quality control, adds additional manpower, requires more analytical instruments.<br>
d)	the final product of formula (I) prepared by this method takes 5 days for drying, thereby increasing the time cycle for each run. This increases drier occupancy and utility for a longer time, thereby, making the process uneconomical.<br>
US 6 525 113 discloses the preparation of Poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride of formula (I) comprising reaction of an aqueous solution of Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) of formula (III) in presence of sodium hydroxide, with epichlorohydrin of formula (IV) at temperature between 20°C to 30°C. The reaction was carried out in a water-miscible solvent like acetonitrile.<br>
It should be noted that this method also utilizes a Class 2 solvent like acetonitrile (methyl cyanide), which has got quite a low exposure limit of 410 ppm. Utilization of such a hazardous cyanide solvent on an industrial scale makes the process environmentally dangerous and less feasible.<br>
9<br><br>
Considering all the above shortcomings in the prior art, the applicant has developed a simple and industrially viable process for the preparation of compound of formula (I), which is one-pot reaction, avoiding isolation of compound of formula (III). The method embodied in this invention reduces the time cycle for each batch run, reduces cost, efforts and thereby, makes the process commercially viable.<br>

In the present invention, all steps are carried out in a single step i.e. the preparation of compound of formula (I) is a one pot reaction, which obviates the need for isolation of compound (III), thereby reducing the time cycle for each batch run and making the process cost-effective.<br>
The compound of formula (I) is a very important and a very costly copolymer used for phosphate binding, in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. It is very important that compound of formula (I), is obtained in high yield with desired specifications, without utilization of additional steps of purification and isolation of intermediate (III).<br>

ADVANTAGES:<br>
The advantages of the process of the present invention are as follows:<br>
i)   This process is a single step process for preparing compound of formula (I) without<br>
isolation of compound (III), <br>
ii) It utilizes comparatively safer solvents having higher exposure limits like alcohols,<br>
instead of nitriles such as acetonitrile or chlorinated solvents like chlorobenzene and o-<br>
dichlorobenzene. Avoids use of hazardous solvents such as methyl cyamide.<br>
 iii) It reduces the load on effluent by preparing compound (I) by eliminating the step of<br>
repeated leaching or washing of compound (III),<br>
22<br><br>
iv) The process avoids the operational difficulties, which are due to the hygroscopic nature of the intermediate (III) i.e. like loading of material from centrifuge into the dryer, etc.<br>
v) The process dries of the compound of formula (III) is avoided. Thus, the utility, efforts and cost of the process are reduced.<br>
vi) Use of caustic lye during the preparation of compound (I) from compound (III), makes the process comparatively more feasible than the use of solid sodium hydroxide as addition of solid sodium hydroxide makes the reaction suddenly exothermic and due to slow dissolution of solid sodium hydroxide, one cannot have an idea about the exact pH of the reaction mass, whereas caustic lye mixes easily due to which the reaction temperature and pH is controlled effectively.<br>
vii)     The process is simple and economical since it avoids filtration of compound of<br>
       formula (III) and avoids water distillation.<br>
