suspension of 8.52 g (49.47 mmol) 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide in 200 ml isopropanol is added 22.1 g (148.42 mmol, 3 equivalent) 2,4-dichloropyrimidine and 20 ml 10 IVi hydrochloric acid (200 mmol, 4 equivalent). The suspension is stirred at SO"C for 2 h 15 min. The reaction mixture is dilluted with 2 I ethyl acetate and 500 ml water is added. The pH is adjusted to 8-9 by addition of sodium bicarbonate. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is reextracted with 500 ml ethyl acetate. The organic layers are dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to a volume of 300 ml. A crystalline precipitate is formed and removed by filtration (side product). The filtrate is evaporated to 100 ml whereupon the product crystallizes to give 2-(2-chioro-pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-benzenesulfonamide (97% purity by HPLC). The mother liquor of this cristaliisation is further purified by column chromatography and crystallisation to give further 2-(2-chloro-pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-benzenesu!fonamide.<br>

The tilte compound is prepared as described in Example 1 with the difference that in step (a) 2-amino-6-methyl-benzenesulfonamide is used instead of 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide. 2-Amino-6-methyl-benzenesulfonamide may be prepared as described by Girard, Y el al.; J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 11979, 4, 1043-1047: Under an atmosphere of nitrogen m-toluidin (32.1 g, 32.5 ml, 0.30 mmol) is added dropwise to a solution of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (51.3 ml, 83.6 g, 0.59 mmol) in nitroethane (400 ml) at -55 - 49°C. The cold bath is removed and the mixture allowed to warm to -8°C, whereupon aluminium chloride (51 g, 0.38 mmol) is added. Heating the mixture to lOO"C for 20 min forms a clear brown solution, which is cooled to RT and poured on ice. After filtration, washing with ice water and diethyl ether the precipitate is collected and dissolved in dioxane (300 ml). Water (1000 ml) and cone. HCI (1500 ml) are added to form a suspension, which is heated to 120""C for 18h. After cooling to RT the clear brown solution is washed with diethyl ether/hexane (1400 ml, 1/1 vA^) and adjusted to pH = 8 by addition of<br><br>
sodium carbonate. Extraction using ethyl acetate (2 x 1000 ml), washing of the organic phase<br>
with water (500 ml) and brine (500 ml), drying (magnesium sulfate) and concentration yields a<br>
brown solid, which is purified by chromatography on silica using methylene chloride/ethanol<br>
(100/1 v/v) to yield the desired product as a white solid.<br>

In particular the compounds of the invention exhibit ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein of 70 kD), Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and/or Syk protein tyrosine kinases inhibiting activity. More particularly the compounds of the invention are active at the human ZAP-70, FAK and/or Syk protein tyrosine kinases. ZAP-70, FAK and/or Syk protein tyrosine kinase interaction of the compounds of the invention may be demonstrated by their ability to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. LAT-11 (SEQ ID NO: 1) by human ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase, to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. Biot-Y397 (SEQ ID NO:2) by human FAK protein tyrosine kinase, and/or to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. polymeric glutamic acid-tyrosine (Glu, Tyr) by human Syk protein tyrosine kinase in, e.g. aqueous solution, e.g. as demonstrated in accordance with the following test methods.<br>
1.	Cell-free kinase assays: ZAP-70 and Syk Kinase assays<br>
ZAP-70, Lck and Syk are commercially available from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY.<br>
,   Preparation ofLAT-11 (SEQ ID NO:1):The peptide LAT-11 used as a substrate in the ZAP-70 kinase assay may be prepared as disclosed in Example 1A of WO 02/12275, the contents of which, particularly with reference to Example 1A, is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
ZAP-70 Kinase assay: The activities of the agents of invention are determined in a homogenous ZAP-70 kinase assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Briefly, 80 nM ZAP-70 are incubated with 80 nM Lck and 4 ^M ATP in ZAP-70 kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5,10 nM Na3V04, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.01 % bovine serum albumin, 0.05 %<br><br>
Tween 20) for 1 hour at room temperature in a siliconized polypropylene tube. Then, the selective Lck inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; Alexis Biochemlcals) is added (final concentration 1.2 \iM) and incubated for further 10 min. Ten ^l of this solution is mixed with the 10 ^l biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (1 ^iM) as substrate and 20 |al of serial dilutions of inhibitors and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The kinase reaction is terminated with 10 ^i of a 10 mM EDTA solution in detection buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01 % bovine serum albumin, 0.05 % Tween 20). The detection phase is performed by addition of 50 ^1 europium (Eu)-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (e.g. Eu-PT66; final concentration 0.125 nM; Advant/Wallac) and 50 ^l streptavidin-allophycocyanine (SA-APC; final concentration 40 nM) in detection buffer. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature fluorescence is measured, e.g., on the Victor2 Multilabel Counter (Wallac) at 665 nm. Background values (low control) are obtained in the absence of test samples and ATP and are subtracted from all values. Signals obtained in the absence of test samples are taken as 100% (high control). The inhibition obtained in the presence of test compounds was calculated as percent inhibition of the high control. The concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) was determined from the dose-response curves. In this assay, the compounds of the invention have IC50 values in the range of 10 nM to 2 pM, preferably from 10 nM to 100 nM. Compound of Example 4 shows an IC50 value of 12 nM.<br>
Syk Kinase assay: The activities of the agents of invention are determined in a heterogenous Syk kinase assay based on the dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA) technology. This method utilizes europium chelate-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to detect phosphate transfer by Syk to a polymeric glutamic acid-tyrosine (Glu, Tyr) substrate coated onto microtiter plates as described (Braunwalder AF, Yarwood DR, Sills MA, Lipson KE. Measurement of the protein tyrosine kinase activity of c-src using time-resolved fluorometry of europium chelates. Anal.Biochem. 1996;238(2): 159-64). The amount of phosphorylation is then quantified with time-resolved, dissociation-enhanced fluorescence. Briefly, hundred |jl of poly (Glu, Tyr) (4:1; 2 pg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) are coated to ELISA plates overnight at room temperature. The poly (Glu, Tyr) solution is removed and 250 pi of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS are added for one hour at room temperature. Plates are then washed three times with 350 pi of washing buffer (25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4 containing 0.03% Tween-20). The kinase reaction is performed for one hour at room temperature by mixing serial dilutions of inhibitors in 30 pi with 30 pi of Syk kinase (20 ng/ml) and ATP (1 pM) in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5,10 pM Na3V04, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MnCl2, 2 mM MgCIa, 0.01 % bovine serum albumin, 0.05 % Tween 20). After<br><br>
washing the plates four times as described above 60 pi DELFIA europium N1-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (AdvantA/Vallac) are added (100 ng/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH7.4,150 mM NaCI, 20 pM Titriplex V, 0,2% bovine serum albumine, 0.05% Tween-20) and-Incubated for one hour at room temperature. Plates are washed eight times and 60 pi enhancement solution (Wallac) are added. Fluorescence is detemnined at 615 nm (Victor2; Wallac). High control values (100% signal) are obtained in absence of test samples and low control values (background) in absence of test samples and ATP. Low controls were subtracted from all values. The inhibition obtained in the presence of test compounds was calculated as percent inhibition of the high control. The concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) was determined from the dose-response curves. In this assay, the compounds of the invention have IC50 values in the range of 100 nM to 10 pM, preferably from 100 to 1 pM. Compound of Example 128 has an IC50 value of 150 nM.<br>
2.	Allogeneic Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR)<br>
Compounds of the invention exhibit T cell inhibiting activity. More particular the compounds of the invention prevent T cell activation and/or proliferation in e.g. aqueous solution, e.g. as demonstrated in accordance with the following test method. The two-way MLR is perfonned according to standard procedures (J. Immunol. Methods, 1973,2,279 and Meo T. et al.. Immunological Methods, New York, Academic Press, 1979,227-39). Briefly, spleen cells from CBA and BALB/c mice (1.6x10^ cells from each strain per well in flat bottom tissue culture microliter plates, 3.2 x 10^ in total) are incubated in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin (Gibco BRL, Basel, Switzerland), 50 pM 2-mercaptoethanol (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and serially diluted compounds. Seven three-fold dilution steps in duplicates per test compound are performed. After four days of incubation 1 pCi ^H-thymidine is added. Cells are harvested after an additional five-hour incubation period, and incorporated ^H-thymidine is determined according to standard procedures. Background values (low control) of the MLR are the proliferation of BALB/c cells alone. Low controls are subtracted from all values. High controls without any sample are taken as 100% proliferation. Percent inhibition by the samples is calculated, and the concentrations required for 50% inhibition (IC50 values) are detemnined. In this assay, the compounds of the invention have ICso values in the range of 10 nM to 10 pM, preferably from 10 nM to 100 nM. Compound of Example 120 shows an IC50 value of 13 nM.<br>
3.	FAK assay<br><br>
All steps are performed in a 96-well black microtiter plate. Purified recombinarit hexahistidine-tagged human FAK kinase domain is diluted with dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 in water) to a concentration of 94 ng/mL (2.5 nM). The reaction mixture is prepared by mixing 10 pL 5x kinase buffer (250 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 pM Na3V04, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCIa, 50 mM MnClj, 0.05% BSA, 0.25% Tween-20 in water), 20 pL water, 5 pL of 4 pM biotinylated peptide substrate (Biot-Y397) in aqueous solution, 5 pL of test compound in DMSO, and 5 pL of recombinant enzyme solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The enzyme reaction is started by addition of 5 pL of 5 pM ATP in water and the mixture is incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. The reaction is terminated by addition of 200 pL of detection mixture (1 nM Eu-PT66, 2.5 pg/mL SA-(SL)APC, 6.25 mM EDTA in dilution buffer), and the FRET signal from europium to allophycocyanin is measured by ARVOsx+L (Perkin Elmer) after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. The ratio of fluorescence intensity of 665 nm to 615 nm is used as a FRET signal for data analysis in order to cancel the colour quenching effect by a test compound. The results are determined as percent inhibition of enzyme activity. DMSO and 0.5 M EDTA are used as a control of 0% and 100% inhibition, respectively. IC50 values are determined by non-linear curve fit analysis using the OriginPro 6.1 program (OriginLab). In this assay the compounds of formula I inhibit FAK activity at a IC50 
The Biot-Y397 peptide (Biotin-SETDDYAEIID ammonium salt, SEQ ID N0:2) is designed to have the same amino acid sequence as the region from 8392 to D402 of human (GenBank Accession Number LI 3616) and is prepared by standard methods.<br>
Purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human FAK kinase domain is obtained in the following way: Full-length human FAK cDNA is isolated by PCR amplification from human placenta Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (Clontech, No. 7411-1) with the 5" PCR primer (ATGGCAGCTGCTTACCTTGAC, SEQ ID N0:3) and the 3" PCR primer (TCAGTGTGGTCTCGTCTGCCC. SEQ ID N0:4) and subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, No. A3600). After digestion with Acclll, the purified DNA fragment is treated with Klenow fragment. The cDNA fragment is digested with BamHI and cloned into pFastBacHTb plasmid (Invitrogen Japan K.K., Tokyo) previously cut with BamHI and Stu I. The resultant plasmid, hFAK KD (M384-G706)/pFastBacHTb, is sequenced to confirm its structure. The resulting DNA encodes a 364 amino acid protein containing a hexahistidine tag, a spacer region<br><br>
and a rTEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminal and the kinase domain of FAK (Met384-Gly706) from position 29 to 351,<br>
Donor plasmid is transposed into the baculovirus genome, using MaxEfficacy DHIOBac E.coli cells. Bacmid DNA is prepared by a simple alkaline lysis protocol described In the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression system (Invitrogen). Sf9 insect cells are transfected based on the protocol provided by the vendor (CellFECTIN®, Invitrogen). The expression of FAK in each lysate is analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-human FAK monoclonal antibody (clone #77 from Transduction Laboratories).<br>
The virus clone that shows the highest expression is further amplified by infection to Sf9 cells. Expression in ExpresSF+® cells (Protein Sciences Corp., Meriden, Connecticut, USA) gives high level of protein with little degradation. Cell lysates are loaded onto a column of HiTrap™ Chelating Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel sulfate and equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCI and 10 mM imidazole. Captured protein is eluted with increasing amounts of imidazole in HEPES buffer/ NaCI, and further purified by dialysis in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT.<br>
4.        Phosphorylation levels of FAK<br>
Phosphorylation levels of FAK at Tyr397 are quantified by the sandwich ELISA. Mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells (1x10^) are plated in wells of 96-well culture plates and incubated with or without various concentrations of a compound of formula I for 1 h in Dulbecco"s modified eagle medium containing 10% FBS. The medium is removed and cells are lysed in 200 ^L 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, containing 1% NP-40,0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3V04,1 mM NaF, 1 ^g/mL aprotinin, 1 ng/mL leupeptin and 1 ^ig/mL pepstatin. After centrifugation, the supernatants are subjected to a sandwich ELISA to quantify the phosphorylated FAK and total FAK. Cell lysates are applied to 96-well flat-bottom ELISA plates which have been pre-coated with 100 fiL/well of 4 \ig/mL mouse monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (clone 77, Becton Dickinson Transduction Laboratories) in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 9.5, containing 150 mM NaCI for 18 h at 4°C and blocked with 300 ^L of BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals Co.) diluted at 1:4 with HgO at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with TBSN (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.3, containing 300 mM NaCI, 0.1% SDS and 0.05% NP-40), total FAK is detected with 100 \iL of 1 ^g/ml anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (#65-6140, Upstate Biology Inc.), and phosphorylated FAK is detected with 100 nL of 0.25 ^ig/^L anti-<br><br>
phosphorylated FAK (Y397) antibody (Affinity BioReagents, #OPA1-03071) in BlockAce diluted at 1:10 with H2O. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, plates are washed with TBSN and 100 nL of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (#65-6140, Zymed Laboratolies Inc.) diluted at 1:2000 with BlockAce diluted at 1:10 with HgO is incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBSN, ABTS solution substrate kit (#00-2011, Zymed Lobolatories Inc.) is used for color development. Absorbance at 405 nm is measured after 20 min incubation at room temparature. The concentration of compound causing 50% reduction of phosphorylation level of FAK (IC50) is determined. In this assay, compounds of formula I reduce phosphorylation at an IC50 of 
5.        Anchorage-independent tumor cell growth assay<br>
Mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells (5 x 10^) are plated in 96-well Ultra low Attachment plates (#3474, Corning Inc.) in 100 |xL of Dulbecco"s modified eagle medium containing 10% FBS. Cells are cultured for 2 h and inhibitors are added at various concentrations in a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO. After 48 h, cell growth is assayed with the cell counting kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemical), which uses a water soluble tetrazolium salt WST8. Twenty ^L of the reagent is added into each well and cells are further cultured for 2 h. The optical density is measured at 450 nm. The concentration of compound causing 50 % inhibition of growth may thus be determined. Examples 204, 213 and 206 show iCso values of 0.4 pM, 0.016 pM and 0.09 pM respectively.<br>
