				<td>Cell-free graft<br>
This invention relates to a cell-free graft for regenerating tissue and in particular for regenerating<br>
cartilage, a method of producing same and the use of the graft for regenerating tissue.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Cartilage is a form of mesodermal tissue derived from the connective tissue, which is created by<br>
multi-potent, undifferentiated, mesenchymal precursor cells. A distinction is made between three<br>
types of cartilage, hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is by far the most common<br>
form of cartilage and is found in the joint surfaces, for example. Cartilage defects caused by wear<br>
or damage are a widespread medical problem. Due to the denseness of the cartilage of the body's<br>
conventional inflammation and repair system, it has only a low capacity for self-healing. This<br>
being the case, methods and techniques have been developed in the past, and in particular over<br>
the last few years, as a means of replacing chondral as well as osteochondral areas in the joint<br>
cartilage. For example, joint cartilage has been replaced by perios, perichondrium, allogenic and<br>
autologous osteochondral grafts, allogenic meniscuses or prostheses made from synthetic materi-<br>
als.<br>
In situations involving autologous grafting of chondrocytes, chondrocytes taken from the patient<br>
are grown in cell culture and given back to the patient again. They may be given back in the form<br>
of various different types of transplants. Examples of these are injection solutions which are in-<br>
jected into the joint, matrices injected with cartilaginous cells and similar.<br>
Patent specification WO 97/15655, for example, describes artificial tissue comprising three-<br>
dimensional extra-cellular matrices and genetically manipulated cells, and the matrices are able<br>
to release immunosuppressive or cell-differentiating factors. These matrices preferably take the<br>
form of a polymer fleece, through which a cell suspension, which may be suspended in a fibrino-<br><br>
2<br>
gen solution, is distributed. Factors or components of the corresponding extra-cellular matrix<br>
which are necessary for the growth and/or differentiation process may also be added to the ma-<br>
trix. In order keep the cells in the matrix, the cell suspensions may be solidified by adding<br>
thrombin, thereby resulting in the finished graft.<br>
Patent specification DE 44 31 598 describes a method of producing an implant of cell cultures,<br>
whereby three-dimensional support structures to which the cells are applied are firstly encapsu-<br>
lated and then perfused with a nutrient solution. Resorbable micro-bodies are incorporated in the<br>
support structures, which release factors influencing tissue formation as they are resorbed.<br>
Patent specification DE 43 06 661 describes a three dimensional support structure, preferably<br>
made from a polymer fleece, in which the cells are incorporated. The support structure is then<br>
perfused with nutrient solution in order to promote cell growth and the formation of an extra-<br>
cellular matrix by the cells. In order to prevent the cells from migrating or draining out, the sup-<br>
port structure is encapsulated with agarose.<br>
Patent specification DE 101 39 783 also discloses the use of mesenchymal cells in synovial fluid.<br>
If desired, this composition can also be applied to a support, such as a fleece or a plastic, and<br>
used as a graft in this form. Otherwise, the suspension of cells in synovial fluid is injected as<br>
such into the relevant joint.<br>
Alternatively, matrix structures are synthesized which do not actually contain any cells. For ex-<br>
ample, patent specification US 2003/0003153 describes stiffened matrix membranes containing<br>
one or more structure-forming proteins suitable for cell growth. Suitable proteins are collagen,<br>
for example. The resultant matrices in membrane form may be injected with cells or grafted as<br>
they are. In the latter case, it is assumed that cells from the body's own tissue will migrate into<br>
the matrix structure. It is done by means of a conventional Pridie puncture or micro-fracturing,<br>
for example. With these techniques, small punctures or fractures are made in the joint bone as far<br>
as the bone marrow. Blood flows through the punctures into the defect, as a result of which the<br><br>
3<br>
defect is filled with a blood graft. The graft contains mesenchymal precursor cells, which, stimu-<br>
lated by appropriate impetuses, are able to form a cartilage-type replacement tissue, the so-<br>
called fibrocartilage. If a matrix material is placed over the Pridie puncture, the blood cells are<br>
able to migrate into this matrix material, where they then become established.<br>
Patent specifications DE 199 57 388 and WO 2005/014027 use this effect and enhance it by in-<br>
corporating growth and differentiating factors (DE 199 57 388) or chemokines (WO<br>
2005/014027) in the matrix structure as recruiting means. All the factors are intended to result in<br>
enhanced recruitment of cartilage-forming mesenchymal precursor cells, the ultimate aim being<br>
to regenerate the cartilage more rapidly.<br>
Patent specification WO 02/00272, finally, discloses the possibility of producing appropriate<br>
grafts from blood and a polymer component. The underlying problem addressed by this docu-<br>
ment is the fact that the blood graft which forms as standard using the Pridie puncture technique<br>
contracts on coagulation and thus changes shape. The added polymer prevents this change of<br>
shape and thus permits healing true to shape. In order to produce the graft, a polymer is mixed<br>
with blood or a blood component such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, monocytes, platelets, fibrino-<br>
gen, thrombin and platelet-rich plasma and introduced into the defect. If using a blood compo-<br>
nent, however, the presence of material capable of coagulating is a significant factor in terms of<br>
achieving the desired effect.<br>
Grafts made from chitosan and chondrocytes may be used as an alternative. Since the cells are<br>
introduced into the defect as described above, the addition of substances for attraction purposes<br>
and/or growth and differentiating factors can be dispensed with.<br>
The technologies described above have disadvantages because if the graft itself contains cells,<br>
they are often damaged due to manipulation during handling, and if cells are used for the graft, in<br>
particular autologous cells, they have to be produced by a lengthy culture process and have to be<br>
carefully controlled to prevent contamination, and finally, there is no possibility of storage. In<br><br>
4<br>
parallel, the recruitment of cell-free grafts of mesenchymal cells through a Pridie puncture, with<br>
or without substances used for attraction purposes, has proved unsatisfactory. Colonization is<br>
slow, is initiated by few cells and is also non-specific. This means that different cell types are<br>
flushed into the graft from the blood leaving the Pridie puncture and remain there. However, it is<br>
only colonization by mesenchymal precursor cells which differentiate to chondrocytes that is<br>
desired. In the case of conventional grafts, however, this is not guaranteed.<br>
Amongst other things, therefore, the objective of the invention is to propose a graft which is sim-<br>
ple to produce, can be readily stored and is simple to apply. Furthermore, it would be desirable to<br>
increase recruitment rates by means of the graft, obtain better selectivity for the type of cells re-<br>
cruited and disposed in the graft, and to dispense as far as possible with the use of growth factors<br>
foreign to the body and optionally even recombinant growth factors, which represent potential<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention overcomes these and other problems known from the prior art. To this end, a cell-<br>
free graft is proposed, comprising (i) a cohesive, structure-forming matrix with an open porosity<br>
made from a biologically and pharmaceutically acceptable material and (ii) serum. In one par-<br>
ticularly preferred embodiment, the matrix additionally contains a gel.<br>
By virtue of a second aspect, a method of producing such a cell-free graft is proposed, whereby<br>
the matrix and the gel, if one is provided, are placed in contact with the serum. Optionally, the<br>
graft may be dried with serum. Alternatively, the matrix and the gel, if one is provided, may be<br>
in the dried state before being placed in contact with the serum.<br>
Based on a third aspect, the invention finally relates to the use of the cell-free graft for regenerat-<br>
ing tissue and in particular for regenerating cartilage and/or bone.<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
As explained above, the invention relates to a cell-free graft, comprising (i) a cohesive, structure-<br>
forming matrix with open porosity made from a biologically and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
material and (ii) serum. Surprisingly, using serum in the cell-free graft proposed by the invention<br>
enables the recruitment efficiency of mesenchymal precursor cells from the bone marrow<br>
through which blood flows to be increased by several factors. This surprising increase in re-<br>
cruitment efficiency in turn obviates the need to introduce differentiated cells or precursor cells<br>
into the graft separately, which facilitates and shortens handling of the graft and also permits<br>
storage.<br>
Blood serum can be easily obtained in a conventional manner. By preference, it may be taken<br>
directly from the patient during the transplant. Autologous material can therefore be implanted in<br>
the patient, but there is no need to add other, potentially allergenic and/or immuno-active factors.<br>
The matrix of the cell-free graft proposed by the invention is a cohesive, structure-forming ma-<br>
trix of open porosity. The expression "cohesive" in this context should be construed as meaning<br>
that the matrix enables the graft to be handled without falling apart into individual parts or bits. It<br>
is not necessary for all parts of the matrix to be bonded to one another by chemical bonds or in-<br>
teractions. A mechanical join in the form of weaving, fulling, twisting or similar is sufficient.<br><br>
6<br>
The expression "structure-forming" in this context should be construed as meaning the property<br>
of the matrix to function as a structure former for the cells migrating to the tissue matrix to be<br>
produced. The matrix also acts as a frame or lattice which the cells are able to colonize and<br>
where they find purchase, so that they are not entrained out of the matrix by synovial fluid or<br>
blood, for example.<br>
Finally, "open porosity" in the context of the invention should be construed as meaning that the<br>
spaces between the frame structures of the matrix are accessible to a substance and in particular a<br>
fluid exchange with the area around the matrix. The pore size of the pores is preferably dimen-<br>
sioned so that penetration or circulation is also possible by cells. However, the expression open<br>
porosity as used in the context of the invention is also intended to mean a structure such as pre-<br>
vails in gels. It is here that the frame structures of the matrix are provided bv the skeleton of the<br>
structure former. Disposed between them are hydrate pockets and fluid, which the cells can pene-<br>
trate and which enable a fluid exchange. Appropriate gel structures should therefore also be con-<br>
strued as matrices with open porosity within the context of the invention.<br>
The frame structures with open porosity are preferably selected from woven or non-woven fab-<br>
rics (in particular fleece and felt structures), membranes, sponges, wadding, open-cell foams,<br>
wool, braids, ordered and random fiber bundles, porous ceramic materials, spongiosa and gels, as<br>
well as combinations of these. The matrix preferably has a fleece or felt structure. Combinations<br>
of different structures, for example in a layered arrangement, are also possible and fall within the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
In principle, the matrix material may be any appropriate, biologically and pharmaceutically ac-<br>
ceptable material. The matrix material used in the matrix proposed by the invention may be re-<br>
sorbable or non-resorbable. Resorbable materials are preferred. The matrix is preferably a mate-<br>
rial selected from the group comprising natural and synthetic polymers, such as collagen, hyalu-<br>
ronic acid, chitosan, chitin, polysaccharides, celluloses and their derivatives, proteins, polypep-<br><br>
7<br>
tides, polyglycolic acid, poly-lactic acid, poly(glycolide, lactate), caprolactam, ceramic materials<br>
such as oxides, carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides of metals, in particular silicon oxide, titanium<br>
oxide and calcium oxide; minerals such as halogenides, in particular fluorides, hydroxides, sul-<br>
fates of metals, preferably physiologically harmless metals such as calcium phosphate, appatite,<br>
hydroxyl appatite; metals such as titanium, aluminum, gold, silver, stainless steel and mixtures<br>
thereof. More specifically preferred are polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid, collagen or<br>
hyaluronic acid.<br>
As regards polyglycolic acids, it is preferable to use pure polyglycolic acids with molecular<br>
weights of &gt; 20,000, preferably 30,000 to 70,000 g/mol, more especially preferably ca. 50,000<br>
g/mol. The matrix material may be a fleece of polyglycolic acid, such as that sold by Alpha Re-<br>
search Switzerland GmbH under the trade mark PGA-Soft Felt7, In the case of this product, the<br>
resorption time in vivo is ca. 40 to 60 days. After seven days in vitro, the mechanical strength is<br>
still ca. 50% of the initial value as a result of hydrolysis.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the cell-free graft also contains a gel in addition to the<br>
matrix. The gel is applied to at least one side of the matrix and/or at least partially penetrates it.<br>
By preference, the gel penetrates it fully. If the matrix contains such a gel, the matrix itself pref-<br>
erably has a different structure than that of a gel. More especially preferably, stiffer structures as<br>
explicitly specified above are used, with the exception of the gels. Accordingly, the gel is pref-<br>
erably of a lower stiffness than the matrix. Most preferably, fleece and felt structures are used,<br>
into which a gel is introduced.<br>
The gel may be a natural or synthetic hydro-gel. It is preferably of a lower stiffness than the ma-<br>
trix. For example, the gel may be selected from polysaccharides, polypeptides, hyaluronic acid,<br>
fibrin, collagen, alginate, agarose and chitosan, as well as salts, derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable salts are alkali and earth alkali salts of said gels, for example. Most preferred are hyalu-<br>
ronic acid or a hyaluronic acid salt such as Na hyaluronate.<br><br>
8<br>
In terms of hyaluronic acid qualities, qualities produced by fermentation may be used. Alterna-<br>
tively, it is also possible to use hyaluronic acid obtained from animals. The mean molecular<br>
weight of the qualities used is generally between 250 and 6,000 kDa, preferably 1,000 to 2,000<br>
kDa, most preferably approximately 1,200 kDa. Suitable hyaluronic acid products are commer-<br>
cially available. A suitable hyaluronic acid quality is TRB Chemedika AG sold under the Os-<br>
tenil® trade mark, for example. This material is EC certified and therefore suitable for pharma-<br>
ceutical purposes.<br>
The gels may be obtained from sources, precipitation or polymerization of an appropriate gel<br>
former in a physiologically suitable solution. Examples of such suitable solutions are water such<br>
as aqueous solutions of salts (e.g. alkali and earth alkali halogenide (CI, Br, 1), carbonates, phos-<br>
phates, citrates, acetates and similar), organic acids, buffer substances and mixtures thereof. Al-<br>
ternatively, more complex solutions may be used, such as culture media or body fluids or solu-<br>
tions derived from them such as synovial fluid or serum. The quantity of gel former used is se-<br>
lected so that an adequate viscosity of the gel is obtained. In the case of hyaluronic acid, this is<br>
usually within the range of 0.5-50 mg/ml, preferably 0.5-20 mg/ml, most preferably 10 mg/ml.<br>
The most preferred graft is one with a matrix made from PGA fleece or felt, in which a hyalu-<br>
ronic acid gel is incorporated.<br>
The dimensions of the cell-free graft proposed by the invention generally depend on the dimen-<br>
sions of the defect to be treated and the requisite size of the graft. The dimensions may be<br>
adapted as required by the doctor administering the treatment. For lesions in cartilage tissue, es-<br>
pecially in the knee joint, these dimensions are usually in the range of 10 to 50 mm in length, 10<br>
to 50 mm in width and 0.5 to 3 mm in thickness, preferably 10 to 30 mm in length, 10 to 30 mm<br>
in width and 1 to 2 mm in thickness. Most preferable would be sizes of 20 x 20 mm width and<br>
length and 1.1 to 2 mm thickness. Dimensions can be adapted for non-square shapes, e.g. rectan-<br>
gular, round, oval, polyhedral, etc..<br><br>
9<br>
The advantage of the combination of matrix and gel in the cell-free graft proposed by the inven-<br>
tion is that the gel forms a mechanical barrier with respect to cells other than mesenchymal pre-<br>
cursor cells of the blood penetrating the Pridie puncture or similar fractures. This enables a selec-<br>
tive migration of mesenchymal precursor cells into the graft. Only these establish themselves in<br>
the matrix, therefore, and differentiate to the desired tissue cells. Other cells growing over the<br>
desired tissue-forming cells are therefore prevented or significantly reduced.<br>
At the same time, the gel promotes the retention of the desired cells under mechanical stress be-<br>
fore the natural bio-matrix of the cartilage forms around the latter. This enables stress to be re-<br>
lieved earlier, once the patient has received the graft.<br>
The second element needed for the cell-free graft proposed by the invention is serum, usually<br>
the invention is meant the part of the blood which remains liquid once the blood has coagulated.<br>
Serum does not contain any blood cells and, unlike blood plasma, no fibrinogen. The other ele-<br>
ments of blood plasma are also to be found in serum. These are fat, fatty acids, glycerin, sugar,<br>
salts, metals and plasma proteins. The plasma proteins include, for example, transport proteins,<br>
enzymes, proenzymes, enzyme inhibitors, the complement system, immuno-pioteins, inflamma-<br>
tion mediators and similar.<br>
The serum to be used for the purpose of the invention may be modified by adding at least one<br>
element and/or removing at least one serum component. In a preferred embodiment, the serum is<br>
not modified. More especially preferred is an autologous serum. This can be obtained by taking<br>
blood from the patient and obtaining the serum using conventional methods. Obtained in this<br>
manner, the serum may be placed in contact with the matrix and with the gel, if one is provided,<br>
and thus incorporated in the graft, optionally by the doctor administering the treatment, directly<br>
at the site of the graft.<br><br>
10<br>
Alternatively, a modified serum is used. If the modification involves adding at least one constitu-<br>
ent, it may be preferable to select the latter from the group comprising growth factors, differen-<br>
tiation factors (on this subject, see patent specification DE 199 57 388, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference), hormones, cytokines, cellular adhesion molecules, chemotactic factors in-<br>
cluding chemokines, such as described in patent specification WO 2005/014027, which is incor-<br>
porated herein by way of reference, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, coenzymes, minerals, fats, lip-<br>
ids, saccharides, pharmaceutical substances such as antibiotics, analgesics, inflammation inhibi-<br>
tors and immuno-suppressants, buffer substances, stabilizers, in particular cryogenic stabilizers,<br>
and vitamins, preferably hormones, chemokines, growth factors and differentiation factors. The<br>
hormones, chemokines, growth and differentiation factors are preferably selected from insulin,<br>
PDGF, IGF, GMCSF, GDF5, GDF6, FGF, BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, IL8, SDFl-a and EGF. Most<br>
preferred is insulin. The matrix and/or the gel may also be modified by incorporating the ele-<br>
ments listed above or mixtures thereof.<br>
Alternatively, specific elements such as enzymes, immuno-proteins, proenzymes, sugars, etc., for<br>
example, may be selectively removed by means of affinity chromatography, for example. The<br>
serum may also be diluted. To this end, serum is mixed with the desired quantity of physiologi-<br>
cally acceptable liquid, such as citrate buffer, PBS or similar.<br>
The cell-free graft described above may be produced by a method whereby the matrix and, if one<br>
is provided, the gel, is placed in contact with the serum. This contacting may be done by apply-<br>
ing in drops, softening, impregnation or soaking. By preference, if the gel is provided, it is incor-<br>
porated in the matrix first of all and/or applied to it, after which the process of making contact<br>
with the serum takes place. If the cell-free graft contains other elements such as listed above,<br>
these may be incorporated in one or more of the matrix, gel and serum.<br>
The method proposed by the invention may include a drying step. The advantage of using a dry-<br>
ing step is that the graft can be stored for longer in dried form. If the matrix and, if one is pro-<br>
vided, the gel, are dried before being placed in contact with the serum, this structure can be re-<br><br>
11<br>
constituted by soaking or softening when placed in contact with serum, thereby transforming it<br>
into a ready-to-use state. Alternatively, if the structure comprising the matrix, gel, if one is pro-<br>
vided, and serum is dried, it can be reconstituted by soaking or softening in serum or some other<br>
appropriate pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable solution, as described above in<br>
connection with forming the gel, for example physiologically acceptable salt solution, and thus<br>
transformed into a ready-to-use state. If the graft proposed by the invention contains other ele-<br>
ment these may also be incorporated in the solution used to reconstitute the cell-free graft to the<br>
ready-to-use state. This may be desirable in particular if the other elements are proteins or non-<br>
stable co-factors.<br>
In the case of the preferred embodiments made from polyglycolic acid fleece with hyaluronic<br>
acid gel described above, fleece sizes of 20 mm x 20 mm x 1.1 mm are used with ca. 400 ul of a<br>
hyaluronic acid solution (10 mg/inl) incorporated in the material in a physiologically suitable<br>
solution or already incorporated in serum. In the case of fleeces of 20 mm x 20 mm x 2 mm, ca.<br>
730 ul of hyaluronic acid solution are used. If grafts of these dimensions are dried by lyophiliza-<br>
tion, for example, they can be reconstituted by soaking them in 1 to 2 ml of solution. In the case<br>
of dried matrices without serum, they are preferably reconstituted with serum or diluted serum,<br>
whereas dried matrices containing serum are preferably reconstituted in physiological salt solu-<br>
tion.<br>
Suitable serum concentrations are 1 to 100% by volume of the volume of gel and fluid contained<br>
in the matrix. Preferably, in the case of matrices without gel, serum concentrations of 10 to<br>
100%, preferably 50 to 100% and most preferably 100% of the fluid volume are used, incorpo-<br>
rated amongst other things by capillary forces. In order to reduce the serum concentration below<br>
100%, serum diluted with physiologically acceptable salt solution may be used.<br>
In the case of matrices with gel, serum contents of 0.01 to 50% by volume, or stronger, prefera-<br>
bly 0.5 to 20% by volume, and most preferably 1 to 10% by volume of serum may be used by<br>
reference to the total volume of gel, serum and optionally pharmaceutically acceptable liquid.<br><br>

The cell-free graft proposed by the invention may be used to regenerate tissue and in particular to<br>
regenerate cartilage and/or bone. It is preferably used to regenerate mesenchymal tissue. Most<br>
preferably, it is used to regenerate cartilage and/or bone, in particular using the Pridie puncturing<br>
method or micro-fracturing. The graft acts as an intelligent cover which is introduced into the<br>
cartilage in an exact fit after Pridie puncturing or micro-fracturing in order to restore the joint<br>
surface. The matrix material, preferably felt material, imparts mechanical stability and acts as a<br>
conductive structure, which promotes the homogeneous, three-dimensional distribution of pa-<br>
tients cells migrating in from the bone marrow and spongious bone. The gel, such as hyaluronic<br>
acid, acts as a barrier in order to prevent the inward migration of red blood cells and leukocytes.<br>
The serum, preferably autologous serum, promotes the migration of cells, especially mesenchy-<br>
mal precursor cells, into the graft and hence into the defect. Maturing or differentiation of the<br>
mesenchymal precursor cells which have migrated into the graft to form chondrocytes and hence<br>
build a cartilagenous regenerating tissue is induced by the hyaluronic acid, serum and the syno-<br>
vial fluid present in the joint. Surprisingly, using serum has been found to increase recruitment<br>
numbers significantly.<br>
The examples given below are merely intended to illustrate the invention and should not be con-<br>
strued as restrictive it in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
Recruitment of human mesenchymal stem cells by means of growth and differentiation factors,<br>
chemokines and human serum in vitro<br>
A Isolation and cultivation of human mesenchymal stem cells<br>
The way in which human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are isolated from bone marrow has<br>
already been described [DE 103 33 901]. A maximum of 3 ml of bone marrow punctate are<br>
mixed with 10 ml of PBS and centrifuged for 10 min. and at 310 g at room temperature. The cell<br><br>
13<br>
pellet is re-suspended and washed with PBS again. The cells are placed in 20 ml of DME me-<br>
dium (with 10-20% FBS, 2% HEPES, 4 mM of L-glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 fig/ml<br>
of streptomycin). Every 5 ml of this cell suspension is introduced onto 20 ml of a Percoll density<br>
gradient with a density of 1.073 g/ml. The cells are centrifuged at 900 g for 32 min. The upper<br>
phase is transferred to a new centrifuge tube. This is centrifuged at 310 g for 6 minutes after add-<br>
ing 2.5-times the volume of PBS. The cell pellet is placed in DME medium. 1.5*105-3.5*105<br>
cells/cm are transferred to culture in a cell culture flask and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. The<br>
medium is changed for the first time after 72 hours, and then every 3-4 days. Isolated in this<br>
manner, the cells grow confluently after 2-3 weeks and are then transferred into a new culture<br>
vessel by means of trypsinization in a cell density of 6,000 cells/cm2 culture surface (passage 1).<br>
After about one week, the cells are trypsinized again (passage 2). The homogeneity of this cul-<br>
ture of human mesenchymal stem cells is verified by means of F ACS analysis, in which connec-<br>
tion the surface antigens cndoglin and ALCAM are to be identified and the surface antigens<br>
CD34, CD 45 and CD 14 are not identified.<br>
B	Testing the chemotactic activity of growth and differentiation factors (CDMP1, CDMP2)<br>
and chemokines (SDFl-a, IL8) on human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro<br>
The chemotactic effect of growth and differentiation factors, such as cartilage derived morpho-<br>
genetic protein-1 (CDNP1 or growth and differentiation factor-5, GDF5) and cartilage derived<br>
morphogenetic protein-2 (SDNP2 or growth and differentiation factor-6, GDF6) on mesenchy-<br>
mal stem and precursor cells has already been described [DE 199 57 388]. The chemotactic ef-<br>
fect or use of chemokines, such as stromal derived factor-1α (SDFl-α) or interleukin-8 (IL8) for<br>
recruiting mesenchymal stem and precursor cells has also been described [DE 103 33 901].<br>
Chemotactic activity is tested in so-called 96-well chemotaxis plates (ChemoTx system, Neuro-<br>
probe, USA). The test principle is based on transferring the substance to be tested, in solution, in<br>
a defined quantity and concentration to a well. The well is then covered by means of a membrane<br>
with pores (pore size in this instance 8 μm), so that the bottom face of the membrane is wetted by<br><br>
14<br>
the solution containing the chemotactic solution.<br>
A defined quantity of cell suspension which does not contain the substance to be tested is placed<br>
on the top face of the membrane remote from the well. After a few hours, a concentration gradi-<br>
ent of substance to be tested develops, starting from the lower well through the membrane. If the<br>
substance to be tested is chemotactically active, cells of the cell suspension migrate through the<br>
pores of the membrane to the membrane bottom face and into the lower well. The migrated cells<br>
are dyed and their number is determined with the aid of a microscope.<br>
For control purposes, lower wells are provided with the solvent of the substance to be tested,<br>
covered with the membrane and coated with the cell suspension. By microscopically counting<br>
the cells on the membrane bottom face (surface: 25 mm2) and in the lower well, the cells which<br>
have migrated spontaneously due to the chemotactic substance without stimulus are determined.<br>
In order to determine the cell count recruited by the chemotactic substance, the number of spon-<br>
taneously migrated cells is subtracted.<br>
Prior to starting the test of the above-mentioned growth and differentiation factors and chemoki-<br>
nes, human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow were displaced for 24 hours with diet<br>
medium (DME medium + 1% of penicillin/streptomycin + 0.5% of bovine serum albumin<br>
(BSA). The growth and differentiation factors and chemokines were placed in diet medium in<br>
different quantities to obtain defined solutions respectively of 250 nM, 500 nM, 750 nM and<br>
1000 nM of the factors. 36 ul of the respective solutions were placed in triplicate in lower wells<br>
of the 96-well chemotaxis plate and covered with the membrane so that the membrane bottom<br>
face was wetted by the solutions. Diet medium was used as the control.<br>
40 ul of diet medium with 30,000 human mesenchymal stem cells were placed on the top face of<br>
the membrane. After 20 hours of cultivation in the breeding cabinet at 37°C, 5% CO2, the mem-<br>
brane was removed and placed in ice-cold ethanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) for 3 minutes in order to fix<br>
the cells. The membrane top face was thoroughly cleaned by means of a cotton bud to remove<br><br>
15<br>
adhered cells. Cells on the membrane bottom face were dyed with Hemacolor solution (Merck,<br>
Darmstadt). No cells could be detected in the lower well.<br>
The cells disposed on the bottom face of the membrane were counted by counting them under the<br>
microscope. The number of stem cells recruited by CDMP1, CDMP2, SDFl-a and IL8 in differ-<br>
ent concentrations was determined after subtracting the migrated cells in the control set (without<br>
chemotactic factor). The mean values of the cell counts with standard deviations are set out in<br>
Fig. 1 for the respective factors. CDMP1 was able to induce a maximum of 156 MSC (750 nM<br>
CDMP1) per 25 mm2 to migrate. CDMP2 recruited a maximum of 38 MSC (500 nM CDMP2)<br>
per 25 mm2, SDFl-a a maximum of 79 MSC (750 nM SDFl-a) per 25 mm2 and IL8 a maximum<br>
of 814 MSC (500 nM IL8) per 25 mm2.<br>
C	Testing the chemotactic activity of human serum of the blood on human mesenchymal<br>
stem cells in vitro<br>
Surprisingly, the testing of human serum by means of the test method described under B showed<br>
that human serum has a significantly stronger chemotactic effect on human mesenchymal stem<br>
and precursor cells in vitro than growth and differentiation factors and chemokines. The cell<br>
counts of the human mesenchymal stem and precursor cells recruited on average by human se-<br>
rum in different formulations (in diet medium or in hyaluronic acid) together with corresponding<br>
standard deviations are set out in Fig. 2. Depending on the formulation, a minimum 2,135 (PGA<br>
- HA lyo. + HS) and a maximum of 10,332 (5% HS-HA - medium) of human mesenchymal stem<br>
and precursor cells were recruited by human serum. Tests on hyaluronic acid without human<br>
serum in diet medium as a chemotactic factor showed on average 24 (HA medium) and on aver-<br>
age 48 (PGA - Ha lyo. + NaCl) human mesenchymal stem and precursor cells which were re-<br>
cruited.<br><br>
16<br>
The following different formulations of human serum were used in the described test method to<br>
recruit human mesenchymal stem and precursor cells. Human serum was obtained from full<br>
blood samples (n=5) without anti-coagulants based on natural coagulation, mixed in equal parts<br>
and used to produce the different serum formulations. In order to produce the test sets "5% HS<br>
medium" and "10% HS medium", diet medium was displaced with human serum, resulting in<br>
5% and 10% solutions. The "HA medium" test set comprises diet medium and hyaluronic acid<br>
obtained by fermentation (Ostenil®, TRB Chemedica AG) with a mean molecular weight of<br>
1,200 kDa in equal parts. The "1% HS-HA medium", "5% HS-HA medium" and "20% HS-HA<br>
medium" test sets contain "HA medium" to which human serum was added, resulting in 1%, 5%<br>
and 10%-strength solutions.<br>
In order to obtain the "PGA -10% Hs-HA, lyo." test set, 270 ul of hyaluronic acid obtained by<br>
fermentation (Ostenil®, TRB Chemedica AG) were mixed with 30 ul of human serum and ap-<br>
plied to a fleece (PGA-Soft Felt®, Alpha Research Switzerland GmbH) comprising polyglycolic<br>
acid (PGA) with dimensions of 20 mm x 15 mm x 1.1 mm. The fleece soaked with the hyalu-<br>
ronic acid-serum mixture was frozen for 1 hour at -20°C and then freeze-dried for 16 hours in the<br>
lyophilizer. To reconstitute it, the freeze-dried fleece was placed in 1 ml of physiological salt<br>
solution for 10 minutes, in order to obtain approximately 80-100 ul of the hyaluronic acid-serum<br>
solution by means of centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm. By diluting the solution with<br>
diet medium in equal parts, the formulation "PGA - 10% HS-HA, lyo." was produced and used<br>
directly for testing chemotactic activity.<br>
In order to make up the "PGA-Ha, lyo. + HS" test set, 300 ul of hyaluronic acid obtained by<br>
fermentation (Ostenil®, TRB Chemedica AG) were applied to a fleece (PGA-Soft Felt®, Alpha<br>
Research Switzerland GmbH) comprising polyglycolic acid (PGA) with dimensions of 20 mm x<br>
15 mm x 1.1 mm. The fleece soaked with the hyaluronic acid was frozen for 1 hour at -20°C and<br>
then freeze-dried for 16 hours in the lyophilizer. To reconstitute it, the freeze-dried fleece was<br>
placed in 1 ml of human serum for 10 minutes, in order to obtain approximately 80-100 ul of the<br>
hyaluronic acid-serum solution by means of centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm. By dilut-<br><br>
17<br>
ing the solution with diet medium in equal parts, the formulation "PGA - HA, lyo.+ HS" was<br>
produced and used directly for testing chemotactic activity.<br>
In order to make up the "PGA-Ha, lyo. + NaCl" test set, 300 ul of hyaluronic acid obtained by<br>
fermentation (Ostenil®, TRB Chemedica AG) were applied to a fleece (PGA-Soft Felt®, Alpha<br>
Research Switzerland GmbH) comprising polyglycolic acid (PGA) with dimensions of 20 mm x<br>
15 mm x 1.1 mm. The fleece soaked with the hyaluronic acid was frozen for 1 hour at -20°C and<br>
then freeze-dried for 16 hours in the lyophilizer. To reconstitute it, the freeze-dried fleece was<br>
placed in 1 ml of physiological salt solution for 10 minutes, in order to obtain approximately 80-<br>
100 ul of the hyaluronic acid solution by means of centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm.<br>
By diluting the solution with diet medium in equal parts, the formulation "PGA - HA, lyo.+<br>
NaCl" was produced and used directly for testing chemotactic activity.<br>
Example of embodiment 2<br>
A polyglycolic acid fleece commercially available under the trade mark PDA-Soft Felt® sold by<br>
Alpha Research Switzerland GmbH was cut to the dimensions of 20 mm x 15 mm x 1.1 mm. The<br>
material was impregnated with a hyaluronic acid mixture containing 10% serum as described in<br>
examplel and then dried. Drying initially took place at -20°C and then for 16 hours in the ly-<br>
ophilizer. The fleece was reconstituted by soaking with 1 to 2 ml of physiological salt solution<br>
for 10 min.<br>
In an alternative test set, the fleece was impregnated with pure hyaluronic acid, 10 mg/ml dis-<br>
solved in physiological salt solution. Prepared in this manner, the material was dried as described<br>
above. It was reconstituted by soaking it in 1 to 2 ml of serum for 10 min. Both fleeces may be<br>
used directly for grafting.<br><br>
