TITLE<br>
"DEVICE FOR WINDING UP SEVERAL BUNCHES OF THREADS"<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Saurer GmbH &amp; Co. KG<br>
Landgrafenstrasse 45<br>
D-41069 Monchengladbach Germany<br>
Nationality : a German company<br>
The following specification particularly describes<br>
the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
Device for winding up several bunches of threads<br>
The invention relates to a device for winding up several bunches of threads, having two winding machines arranged mirror-symmetrically next to one another, according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
It is to be observed, in the production of synthetic threads, that there is an increasing tendency for a multiplicity of threads to be spun simultaneously from a polymer melt next to one another in parallel in a spinning position and subsequently to be wound up into bobbins. Thus, it is known to spin ten, twelve, sixteen or more threads in parallel and simultaneously wind them up into bobbins. The winding up of the threads may in this case take place by means of winding machines in which the bobbins are held on a winding spindle and are wound. Where greater bobbin widths and a large number of threads are concerned, winding machines of this type require correspondingly long winding spindles. Novel concepts have therefore been developed in which the multiplicity of threads are divided into several bunches of threads, and the bobbins of one thread bunch are wound up by means of a first winding spindle and the bobbins of the other thread bunch are wound up in parallel by means of a second winding spindle.<br>
DE 100 45 473 Al and JP 2000-177927 A disclose devices in which two winding machines are arranged mirror-symmetrically next to one another. A thread bunch is supplied to each of the winding machines in order to wind up the threads of the thread bunch into bobbins. For this purpose, the winding machines are placed together next to one another, parallel to the longitudinal side of the device, and between them form a plane of mirror-symmetry. In this case, the winding machines are designed in a mirror-symmetrical identical manner in terms of their set-up and the arrangement of<br>
1<br><br>
their mechanical and electrical subassemblies. The two winding machines can be operated independently of one another. Owing to the mirror-symmetry within the known devices, therefore, two types of winding machines must always be provided, which in each case require an identical direction outlay. Thus, each of the winding machines has mechanical and electrical subassemblies which contain the same fastenings and housing claddings.<br>
To wind up several bunches of threads, however, devices are also known from WO 03/068648 Al in which the subassemblies of two winding machines are combined into one machine. In this case, the subassemblies can be operated only jointly and cannot be separated in order, for example, to wind up only one of the thread bunches. Furthermore, devices of this type have disadvantages on account of their size and weight, since, in many spinning plants, regular maintenance has to be carried out on the individual winding machines and, for this purpose the winding machines have to be changed out of the spinning position.<br>
The object of the invention is to develop a device of the generic type, with two winding machines arranged mirror-symmetrically next to one another, in such a way that, despite a separate type of operation of the winding machine, an integration of the subassemblies which reduces the production outlay of the device becomes possible.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, in that the winding machines are designed differently, independently of the mirror-symmetry, in terms of their set-up and the arrangement of their subassemblies, the functions of the subassemblies in the respective winding machines being maintained.<br>
3<br><br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are afforded by the features and feature combinations of the subclaims.<br>
The  invention  adopts  a  completely  novel  way  of operating two winding machines in one device. The two winding machines are therefore no longer uniform in terms  of  their  subassemblies.  Thus,  for  example, subassemblies may be displaced or combined, but without varying the functions of the winding machines. Thus, both winding machines can, as before, be driven and controlled separately. The particular advantage of the invention is a newly provided freedom of design which has considerable potential for cost saving and for the optimization of  operating  sequences.  Moreover,  the device according to the invention allows a highly compact type of construction of the winding machines, so that it is suitable, in particular, for winding up several bunches of threads of a spinning position.<br>
According to a particularly preferred development of the invention, at least one subassembly assigned to one of the winding machines is assigned to the other winding machine. Thus, for example, one of the winding machines can be designed in a basic version which contains essentially the subassemblies necessary for winding up the thread bunches. The opposite winding machine contains, in addition to the basic version, all further additional subassemblies which allow both winding machines to function completely.<br>
The development in which the electrical subassemblies, such as, for example, the drive electronics and the control devices, are arranged, combined, on one of the winding machines is in this case particularly advantageous. Thus, all the sensitive components can be jointly clad, in order to keep surrounding influences away from the spinning plant and avoid faults.<br><br>
However, even mechanical subassemblies, in particular a thread piecing device, can be combined in such a way as to be held, as far as possible, on one of the machine stands by a common fastening means.<br>
Since the mechanical subassemblies, in particular the winding spindles used in the winding machines, are subject to specific maintenance cycles, a regular exchange of the winding machines is provided. In this case, it is particularly advantageous that the machine stand is formed from two stand parts connected releasably to one another. Thus, the winding machines can be exchanged independently of one another and be combined with any other winding machine. Handling in order to exchange the winding machine can consequently be made considerably easier.<br>
In this case, it is particularly advantageous if the central control unit is connected releasably to the winding machines. Thus, the electrical subassemblies and the mechanical subassemblies of the winding machines can be combined into exchangeable structural units.<br>
The device according to the invention is described in more detail below by means of some exemplary embodiments, with reference to the accompanying figures in which:<br>
fig. 1 to fig. 5 illustrate diagrammatically several<br>
views of a first exemplary embodiment of a<br>
device according to the invention, fig. 6  illustrates  diagrammatically  a  view  of  a<br>
further  exemplary  embodiment  of  the  device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figures 1 to 5 illustrate diagrammatically a first<br>
f<br><br>
exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention in various views. Thus, fig. 1 shows a front view and fig. 2 a cross-sectional view of one of the winding machines, fig. 3 shows a cross-sectional view of the other winding machine, fig. 4 shows a top view of the device and fig. 5 shows a front view of the device at the commencement of the process.<br>
Inasmuch as there is no express reference made to one of the figures, the following description applies to all the figures.<br>
The device has two winding machines, the winding machine arranged on the right longitudinal side in fig. l being designated as a right-hand winder l, and the winding machine arranged mirror-symmetrically to this on the left longitudinal side of the device being designated as a left-hand winder 2. The right-hand winder 1 is arranged in the machine stand part 6.1 and the left-hand winder 2 in a machine stand part 6.2. The machine stand parts 6.1 and 6.2 are connected releasably to one another by several connection means 7.<br>
The left-hand winder 2, which is shown in a side view in fig. 3, has several mechanical subassemblies which are explained in more detail below. A winding turret 3.2 is held, mounted rotatably, on the machine stand 6.2. The winding turret 3.2 is coupled to the rotary drive 23.2. Two lengthily projecting winding spindles 4.2 and 5.2 are mounted rotatably on the winding turret 3.2 of the left-hand winder 2. The first winding spindle 4.2 is coupled to a spindle drive 21.2 and in the operating situation illustrated is located in a winding region. The circumference of said winding spindle has tensioned on it several tubes 8, on which several threads 20.1 of a first thread bunch 20 are wound into bobbins 9. The second winding spindle 5.2 is<br>
L<br><br>
held, offset at 180° with respect to the first winding spindle 4.2, on the winding turret 3.2 and is located in a changing region. The second winding spindle 5.2 carries several tubes 8 on its circumference.<br>
In the thread run, the winding spindles 4.2 and 5.2 of the left-hand winder 2 are preceded by a pressure roller 11.2 and a traversing device 13.2. The pressure roller 11.2 extends essentially over the entire length of the winding spindles 4.2 and 5.2 and is held rotatably at its ends on a roller rocker 12.2. The roller rocker 12.2 is attached pivotably to the machine stand part 6.2.<br>
The traversing device 13.2 has, for each winding station, a laying unit by means of which the respective thread is laid back and forth within a traversing stroke in the winding station. In this exemplary embodiment, the traversing device 13.2 is designed as a vane-type traversing device, such is known, for example, from EP 0 771 3 02. For a further description of a traversing device of this type, to that extent, reference is made to this publication.<br>
The subassemblies described above constitute a basic version of one of the winding machines, in this case the left-hand winder 2. By contrast, the right-hand winder 1 contains the same subassemblies and also additional subassemblies which act both on the right-hand winder 1 and on the left-hand winder 2. The set-up of the right-hand winder 1 is in this case essentially identical to the set-up of the left-hand winder 2. In this case, the individual subassemblies of the left-hand winder 2 are attached to the machine stand 6.2 mirror-symmetrically with respect to the subassemblies of the right-hand winder 1. To explain the basic version of the right-hand winder 1, reference is therefore made to the preceding description relating to<br>
0-<br><br>
the  left-hand  winder  2,  and  only  the  additional subassemblies are described below.<br>
On the topside of the machine stand part 6.1 of the right-hand winder 1, which is shown in the side view in fig. 2, are arranged, combined, the electrical subassemblies in the form of a control device 14 and of drive electronics 28. The control device 14 and the drive electronics 2 8 are connected to the rotary drive 23. l, the spindle drives 21.1 and 22.1 and the drives and actuators of the right-hand winder 1, which are not illustrated in any more detail here, and also to the rotary drive 23.2, the spindle drives 21.2 and 22.2 and the drives and actuators of the left-hand winder 2, which are not illustrated in any more detail here. The control device 14 and the drive electronics 28 thus constitute a central control unit for both winding machines.<br>
On the topside of the right-hand winder 1, a further mechanical subassembly for guiding the thread bunches 19 and 20 during the run into the winding machines 1 and 2 is provided. For this purpose, a thread guide strip 16 is arranged on a carrier 15. The thread guide strip 16 has, parallel to the winding spindles of the right-hand winder 1 and of the left-hand winder 2, a first group of thread guides 17 and a second group of thread guides 18. The first group of thread guides 17 is formed by a total of 4 thread guides 17.1 to 17.4 which are assigned to the threads 19.1 to 19.4 of the first thread bunch 19. The thread guides 17.1 to 17.4 in each case precede the traversing device 13.1 of the right-hand winder 1 and form the thread run-in to the individual winding stations and therefore the end of the respective traversing triangle.<br>
The second group of thread guides 18 is formed by the thread guides 18.1 to 18.4 which are assigned to the<br>
9<br><br>
threads 20.1 to 20.4 of the second thread bunch. For this purpose, the thread guides 18.1 to 18.4 are held, projecting more lengthily, on the thread guide strip 16, so that the thread guides 18.1 to 18.4 are held in a second thread running plane for guiding the second thread bunch 20. The thread guides 18.1 to 18.4 in this case form the thread run-in to the winding stations of the left-hand winder 2 and precede the traversing device 13.2. The thread guides 18.1 to 18.4 thus constitute the start of the respective traversing triangle of a winding station.<br>
As may be gathered from figure 4, the first group of thread guides 17 and the second group of thread guides 18 are held movably on the thread guide strip 16. For this purpose, in each case, those thread guides of the two groups which are assigned to the opposite winding stations of the right-hand winder 1 and of the left-hand winder 2 are arranged in each case on a sliding shoe 24. Thus, the thread guides 17.1 and 18.1 are fastened to the sliding shoe 24.1, the thread guides 17.2 and 18.2 are fastened to the sliding shoe 24.2, etc. The sliding shoes 24 are arranged in a linear guide 25 and can be guided back and forth in the linear guide by means of a linear drive 26. In this case, the sliding shoes 24.1 to 24.2 could, for example, be coupled to one another via a cable pull assembly. The linear drive 26 can be activated by a control apparatus 27 which is integrated in the control device 14. By the linear drive 26 being activated, the groups of thread guides 17 and 18 can be guided back and forth between a piecing position, a catching position and an operating position. In this case, the piecing position of the groups of thread guides 17 and 18 is selected when a piecing of the threads becomes necessary at the commencement of the process or after a thread break. The catching position is selected when the threads are to be caught in the catching slots of the tubes at the<br>
7<br><br>
commencement of a winding-up operation.<br>
In order to piece the threads of the thread bunches 19 and 20 to the tubes 8 of the winding spindles 4.1 and 4.2 of the two winding machines, a further subassembly in the form of a piecing device 29 is arranged on the right-hand winder 1. The piecing device 29 is shown in figures 1, 2 and 3 in a position of rest and in fig. 5 in an operating position for piecing the thread bunches.<br>
For the first piecing of the thread bunches 19 and 20, the right-hand winder 1 is assigned a thread piecing arm 31.1 and the left-hand winder 2 a thread piecing arm 31.2 of the piecing device 29. The thread piecing arms 31.1 and 31.2 are held pivotably on the machine stand part 6.1 of the right-hand winder 1. For this purpose, the thread piecing arms 31.1 and 31.2 are arranged jointly with one end on a pivot shaft 35. At the opposite end of the thread piecing arm 31.1 and 31.2, thread guide elements are provided in order to deflect the thread bunch 19 and the thread bunch 20 independently of one another. The pivot shaft 35 is fastened to a holder 30 which is attached to the machine stand part 6.1 of the right-hand winder 1. The thread piecing arms 31.1 and 31.2 are connected to a common push drive 32. The push drive 32 is connected via a first push member 33.1 to the thread piecing arm<br>
31.1	and by means of a second push member 33.2 to the<br>
second thread piecing arm 31.2. To activate the piecing<br>
device 29, the push drive 32 is coupled to the control<br>
unit 14. In this case, the thread piecing arms 31.1 and<br>
31.2	of the piecing device 2 9 can be guided<br>
synchronously out of a position of rest into an<br>
operating position. The operating position of the<br>
thread piecing arms 31.1 and 31.2 is illustrated in<br>
fig. 5. In this situation, during first piecing, the<br>
threads of the thread bunch 19 are supplied to the<br><br>
tubes 8 and the winding spindle 4.1. In this case, below the thread guide strip 16, the right-hand winder 1 is assigned a thread lifter 34.1 and the left-hand winder 2 a thread lifter 34.2, by means of which thread lifters a run-in to the traversing device 13.1 and 13.2 is prevented and positioning in the respective winding stations is carried out.<br>
As soon as the thread bunches have been taken over in the respective tubes 8 of the winding spindles 4.1 and 5.1, the winding of the threads commences and the thread piecing arms 31.1 and 31.2 are reset into their positions of rest.<br>
The type of operation of the individual winding machines is known and is disclosed, for example, in EP 0 374 536 Al. To explain the functioning, to that extent, express reference is made at this juncture to the publication cited. Thus, a stroke sensor 3 6.1 and 36.2 is assigned in each case to each roller rocker 12.1 and 12.2. The stroke sensor 36.1 of the right-hand winder 1 and the stroke sensor 36.2 of the left-hand winder 2 are connected to the control device 14. Within the control devices 14, the sensor signals are converted into control signals, in order via the drive electronics 28 to control the rotary drives 23.1 of the winding turret 3.1 and 23.2 of the winding turret 3.2 in each case in such a way that the pressure rollers 11.1 and 11.2 maintain essentially a predetermined position during the winding up of the bobbins 9.<br>
The continued intermittent movement of the winding turrets 3.1 and 3.2 takes place in this case contradirectionally, so that the shifting movement of the bobbin constantly increasing in size on the right-hand winder 1 is executed clockwise as a result of a rotation of the winding turret 3.1 and of that on the left-hand winder 2 counterclockwise as a result of a<br>
1|<br><br>
rotation of the winding turret 3.2. A minimum distance between the right-hand winder 1 and the left-hand winder 2 can consequently be implemented. Thus, the winding turrets 3.1 and 3.2 are arranged at a distance from one another which is smaller than double the diameter of a ready-wound bobbin, preferably smaller than a single diameter of a ready-wound bobbin.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention in a side view. The exemplary embodiment according to fig. 6 is identical to the preceding exemplary embodiment in terms of the set-up and the arrangement of the mechanical subassemblies of the winding machines, so that reference is made to the description relating to figures 1 to 5 and only the differences are explained below at this juncture.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments shown in fig. 6, electrical subassemblies of the winding machines 1 and 2 are combined into a central control unit 36. The central control unit 36 is held separately on a stand part 6.3 of the machine stand on the drive side of the winding machines 1 and 2. The central control unit 36 is in this case coupled to the right-hand winder 1 via a plug connection 37.1 and to the left-hand winder 2 via a plug connection 37.2. All the supply, control and signal lines in the drives, actuators and sensors of the winding machines 1 and 2 are provided by the plug connections 37.1 and 37.2. The stand parts 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 are in each case coupled releasably to one another, so that an exchange of the winding machines 1 and 2 independently of the central control unit 36 is possible. Thus, the stand parts 6.1 and 6.2 could be connected to the stand part 6.3 by simple plugging means, as indicated by dashes.<br>
The exemplary embodiments of  the device which are<br>
13-<br><br>
illustrated in figs 1 to 6 are exemplary in terms of their set-ups and arrangements of the subassemblies. In principle, the right-hand winder and the left-hand winder may be combined within the device in such a way that, for example, the winding turrets are driven and jointly activated via a common drive. The subassemblies illustrated are likewise exemplary. The subassemblies may also be designed in such a way that the thread bunches are also caught according to what may be referred to as the synchronism principle. In this case, the thread deflection and thread guidance are carried out by means of the subassemblies in such a way that, during the first piecing of the threads and the catching of the threads, the thread running direction and the direction of rotation of the tubes are the same.<br><br><br>
