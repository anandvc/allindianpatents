Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Number 60/010,784 filed on<br>
January 29,1996, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to conditioning detergent compositions suitable for use in personal cleansing<br>
applicatiorfwhich not only impart cleansing, wet detangling, dry detangling and manageability properties to<br>
hair, but also which are relatively non-irritating and thus suitable for use by young children and adults<br>
having sensitive skin and eyes.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the past, it has been considered desirable to cleanse hair and then to condition it after<br>
cleansing. For many years, it was necessary to perform these acts in two separate steps. However, with<br>
the advent of so-called "two-in-one" conditioning shampoos, it became possible to condition and cleanse<br>
simultaneously. Unfortunately, many of these two-in-one conditioning shampoos and body cleansers have<br>
proven to be relatively irritating to the eyes and skin and uncomfortable for use with children or sensitive<br>
adults. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to create a conditioning shampoo which has good<br>
cleansing ability, excellent conditioning properties and has a low degree of ocular and skin irritation.<br>

applications nonexclusively including shampoos, gels such as shower gels, baths such as baby baths, and<br>
the like.<br>
The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any<br>
component, ingredient, or step which is not specifically disclosed herein. Several examples are set forth<br>
below to further illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of carrying it out. However, the<br>
invention should not be considered as being limited to the details thereof.<br>
Examples<br>
All amounts of materials are given in parts by weight based on 100 parts of the overall formulation,<br>
unless stated otherwise. The following test procedures were used in the following Examples:<br>
1. Hair Conditioning Properties: Conditioning properties of shampoos are determined by measuring the<br>
average energy and force required to comb hair in the wet and dry state after the hair has been washed<br>
with a particular shampoo formulation in accordance with the method set forth as follows:<br>
a) Preparation of Hair samples: Human hair tresses are prepared by weighing out about 10-12<br>
grams of virgin brown hair, and binding the cuticle end with a cable tie and hot melt glue. The cuticle end<br>
of the bundle is positioned in a binder clip. The hair is fanned out evenly over the width of the binder clip.<br>
Hot melt glue is applied along the edge of the binder clip, joining the clip and the hair. Glue is applied to<br>
the inside of the clip for further strength. A rubber band is applied to the outside of the clip, to keep the<br>
jaws of the clip from separating. The glue is allowed to dry thoroughly. The tress is washed to remove<br>
contaminants such as dust or shampoo residue by immersing the tress in methanol for ten seconds and<br>
removing the tress and allowing it to air dry. Loose hair is removed. Tangles are removed by combing the<br>
tresses with a standard comb or brush. Static charge buildup is removed using a static reducing gun.<br>
The number of trials required for the test is equal to the number of formulations (and suitable<br>
controls) under test. The formulations are randomized such that each product is applied to each tress at<br>
some point in time. Two shampooings each using about 1 cc of shampoo composition are required. The<br>
tress is thoroughly wet under running, 100'F tap water. About 1 cc of a given shampoo composition is<br>
applied evenly from top to bottom of the tress. Using the fingers of both hands, the shampoo is rubbed into<br>
the hair for approximately 30 seconds to produce lather. The tress is then rinsed thoroughly under running,<br>
100'F water. The tress is then again washed and rinsed using a second 1 cc sample of product. The tress<br>
is then allowed to drip dry for 5 minutes.<br>
The tresses are then suspended from a sturdy ring stand such that they hang freely and have<br>
several inches of clearance between the bottom of the tress and the top of the bench.<br>
b) Wet Detanalina Enemy. A Combing Force Device (CFD), which is a hand held,<br>
electromechanical instrument which measures the amount of force or energy required to pass a comb<br>
through the hair, is held horizontally in the one hand and tangles are removed from the tresses by starting<br>
at the lower portion of the tress and moving the CFD downward. Each successive stroke is started at a<br>
point which is higher than the previous stroke. This measurement continues until the CFD passes freely<br>
through the entire length of the tress. Once all tangles have been removed, three top-to-bottom strokes<br>
complete the detangling measurement. The cumulative energy to detangle the hair tresses is reported as<br>
wet detangling energy, in units of gram-seconds (g/sec).<br>
c) Wet Comb Force: After the detangling energy measurement is completed on all tresses, the<br>
tresses are measured for wet comb force. A sensor attached to a curling iron measures the twisting, or<br>
torsional force of the curling iron as the instrument is moved though the hair. The instrument is passed<br>
through the detangled tresses about 25 times. Comb force, expressed in grams, is the median force<br>
required to pass the comb through the detangled tress.<br>
d) Dry Detanalina Energy. After the tresses are blow-dried until they are no longer damp, the<br>
detangling procedure set forth in b is repeated using the dry tresses.<br>
e) Dry Comb Force: After the tresses are blow-dried until they are no longer damp and dry<br>
detangling energy is determined, the combing procedure set forth in c) is repeated using the dry tresses.<br>
2.) Ocular irritation Properties: Irritation to the eyes expected for a given formulation is measured in<br>
accordance with the Invittox Protocol Number 86, the Trans-epithelial Permeability (TEP) Assay" as set<br>
forth in Invittox Protocol Number 86 (May 1994). In general, the ocular irritation potential of a product can<br>
be evaluated by determining its effect on the permeability of a cell layer, as assessed by the leakage of<br>
fluorescein through the layer. Monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are grown to<br>
confluence on microporous inserts in a 24-well plate containing medium or assay buffer in the lower wells.<br>
The irritation potential of a product is evaluated by measuring the damage to the permeability barrier in the<br>
cell monolayer following a 15 minute exposure to dilutions of the product. Barrier damage is assessed by<br>
the amount of sodium fluorescein that has leaked through to the lower well after 30 minutes, as determined<br>
spectrophotometrically. The fluorescein leakage is plotted against the concentration of test material to<br>
determine the EC50 (the concentration of test material that causes 50% of maximum dye leakage, i.e., 50%<br>
damage to the permeability barrier).<br>
Exposure of a layer of MDCK cells grown on a microporous membrane to a test sample is a<br>
model for the first event that occurs when an irritant comes in contact with the eye. In vivo, the outermost<br>
layers of the comeal epithelium form a selectively permeable barrier due to the presence of tight junctions<br>
between cells. On exposure to an irritant, the tight junctions separate, thereby removing the permeability<br>
barrier. Fluid is imbibed to the underlying layers of epithelium and to the stroma, causing the collagen<br>
lamellae to separate, resulting in opacity. The TEP assay measures the effect of an irritant on the<br>
breakdown of tight junctions between cells in a layer of MDCK cells grown on a microporous insert.<br>
Damage is evaluated spectrophotometrically, by measuring the amount of marker dye (sodium<br>
fluorescein) that leaks through the cell layer and microporous membrane to the lower well. Generally, a<br>
passing score is reflected in an EC50 of 2.2% or higher.<br>
Example 1: Compounding of Shampoo Composition<br>
The following pre-blends were prepared:<br>
Preblend A: 1.5 parts of PEG 6000 DS were mixed with 20 parts deionized water at 65°C in a mixing<br>
vessel until a homogeneous mixture was obtained.<br>
Preblend B: 1.00 part glycerine was added to a mixing vessel. 0.1 part Jaguar C17 was added slowly with<br>
agitation and the agitation was continued for 15 minutes. 10.0 parts water were added, 20% citric acid<br>
solution was added to adjust the pH of the blend to 4.0, and agitation was continued for an additional 15<br>
minutes.<br>
Preblend C: 1.0 part Atlas G-4280 was mixed with 0.25 parts fragrance.<br>
Preblend D: 0.05 parts Dowicil 200 were blended with 0.15 parts water and the mixture was stirred until<br>
solution was obtained.<br>
After charging 25.75 parts water to a mixing vessel, 0.19 parts of Polymer JR-400 was added<br>
thereto with maintained agitation until a clear solution was obtained. 12.16 parts Tegobetaine L7, 9.50<br>
parts Cedepal TD-403M, 2.85 Monateric 949J and 5.5 parts Atlas G-4280 were added sequentially to the<br>
solution with agitation. After Preblend A, which was maintained at a temperature of 65°C, was added with<br>
agitation to the solution, Preblend C was then added thereto with agitation. An additional 1.14 parts of<br>
Tegobetaine L7 was then added thereto. 0.18 part Versene 100 XL, 3.21 parts of dye solution, preblend D,<br>
4.00 parts Euperian PK 3000 and 0.75 parts DC 345 were then added sequentially with agitation thereto.<br>
Citric acid solution was added in an amount to adjust the pH of the solution to 6.0. Preblend B was then<br>
added with agitation. The pH was then checked and adjusted to 6.0 with additional citric acid solution. The<br>
amounts of the ingredients used to make the composition of Example 1 are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
The resulting composition was tested for detangling energy and comb force, and the results are<br>
provided in Table 2 below: Ocular Irritation of the resulting composition was also measured, and the data<br>
are presented in Table 3.<br>
Example 2: Compounding of Shampoo Composition without cyclomethicone<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using the ingredients as set forth in Table 1. The<br>
resulting composition was tested for detangling energy and comb force, and the results are provided in<br>
Table 2 below:<br>
Comparative Example 1: Compounding of Shampoo Composition without auar cationic<br>
conditioner or cvclomethicone:<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using the ingredients as set forth in Table 1. The<br>
resulting composition was tested for detangling energy and comb force, and the results are provided in<br>
Table 2 below:<br>
Comparative Example 2: Compounding of Shampoo Composition without Polyquatemium-10 or<br>
cvclomethicone<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using the ingredients as set forth in Table 1. The<br>
resulting composition was tested for detangling energy and comb force, and the results are provided in<br>
Table 2 below:<br>
Table 2 - Detangling Energy and Comb Force Measurements<br>
As indicated by the data in Table 2, the formulations of Examples 1 and 2, which contain both<br>
Polyquatemium-10 and Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, exhibit significantly improved wet<br>
detangling force (lower detangling energy) than either of Comparative examples 1 or 2, each of which<br>
contains only one of the conditioners.<br>
In accordance with prior experience, Polyquatemium-10, when used as the sole conditioner in a<br>
shampoo formulation, was known to have imparted dry hair managability benefits to the compositions.<br>
Similarly, cationic guar compounds have been known to impart wet detangling benefits. Due to the<br>
cationic nature of both of these compounds, it was thought that these compounds, when used mixed<br>
together, would have competed for the anionic sites on the hair and would thus not have resulted in a<br>
shampoo composition exhibiting both improved wet and dry detangling benefits. However, we have<br>
unexpectedly found that the combination of cationic cellulose derivatives and cationic guar derivatives in<br>
the compositions of this invention imparts superior wet and dry detangling properties to the compositions.<br>
More specifically, the wet and dry detangling energy is much lower when using the combination of<br>
conditioners of this invention, i.e., cationic guar derivatives and Polyquatemium-10, than if either of the<br>
conditioners are used alone.<br>
Example 1 differs from Example 2 in the presence of volatile silicone in formulation. As seen<br>
from the data in Table 2, the presence of volatile silicone in Example 1 results in a further reduction in dry<br>
detangling energy. Thus, it can be seen that the combination of cationic polymer conditioners and volatile<br>
silicone of the compositions of this invention afford both excellent wet detangling and dry detangling<br>
benefits.<br>
As indicated above, formulations which exhibit a mean EC50 value of 2.2 or higher are deemed to<br>
pass the ocular irritation test while those exhibiting an EC50 value below 2.2 are deemed to fail the test As<br>
shown in Table 3, the formulation of Example 1 exhibits a passing value, which is on par with Johnson's<br>
Baby Shampoo, a commercial shampoo known for its ocular mildness. In contrast, other commercial<br>
shampoos, i.e., the Pert Plus products marketed by the Proctor &amp; Gamble Company, fail the test.<br>
Thus, it can be seen from the above Examples that the compositions of the present invention<br>
possess superior wet and dry detangling capabilities while retaining low ocular irritation values.<br>
