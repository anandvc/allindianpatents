Method of Friction Control FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The   present   invention  relates   to   a  method   of  friction   control   by lubricating an internal combustion engine comprising a crankcase and at least one of a gear and a wet-clutch with a lubricating composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] It is known that attempts have been made to produce a lubricant universally compatible with two-stroke and/or four-stroke internal combustion engines. The lubricants generally contain a number of different performance additives that are not necessarily designed for application in e.g. a four-stroke motorcycle engine where crankcase oil viscosity is required whilst also requiring properties compatible with extreme pressures and temperatures associated with a gearbox, transmission or clutch. Consequently many additives have properties that adversely effect engine performance or fuel economy. [0002] Kasai et al. (2003 JSAE/SAE International Spring Fuels &amp; Lubricants Meeting, Yokohama, Japan, May 19-22, 2003, Paper title Effect of Engine Oil Additives on Motorcycle Clutch System (SAE2003-01-1956 or JSAE 20030105) discloses borated dispersant in combination with detergents or zinc dithiophosphate as being suitable for friction control. Kasai et al. further states that engine oils containing friction modifiers cannot be applied in a 4-stroke motorcycle engine because they decrease clutch capacity. [0003] US Patent 6,525,004 discloses a composition containing a borated hydrocarbyl succinimide dispersant and a phosphorus compound for use in 2-cycle and small engine four-cycle engines.<br>
[0004] It would be advantageous to have a method of lubricating an internal combustion engine with at least one of a crankcase, a gear, a transmission system and a wet-clutch whilst imparting friction control. The present invention provides a method of lubricating an internal combustion engine whilst imparting friction control.<br>

The molar ratio of the boron compounds to the N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides in one embodiment is 10:1 to 1:4, in another embodiment 4:1 to 1:3, and in another embodiment 1:2. An inert liquid may be used in performing the reaction. The liquid may include toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dimethylformamide or mixtures thereof. Friction Modifiers<br>
[0046] The friction modifiers of the invention include a molybdenum dithiocarbamate, a molybdenum thiophosphate, a long chain fatty acid ester or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0047]      In one embodiment the friction modifier is present at 0.01 wt % to 10 wt %, in another embodiment 0.02 wt % to 5 wt % and in another embodiment 0.05 wt % to 3 wt % of the lubrica'ting composition. Long Chain Fatty Acid Ester<br>
[0048]      In one embodiment the friction modifier is a long chain fatty acid ester.  In another embodiment the long chain fatty acid ester is a mono-ester and in another embodiment the long chain fatty acid ester is a (tri)glyceride. [0049]      The long chain fatty acid ester or glyceride in one embodiment is derived from fatty acids, which are a class of compounds containing a long hydrocarbon chain and a terminal carboxylate group and are characterised as unsaturated or saturated.   In one embodiment the long chain fatty acid ester is derived from the reaction of a long chain fatty acid with an alcohol. [0050]      The long chain fatty acid compounds may be saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic, acyclic or aryl.   When aliphatic, the long chain fatty acid compounds may have a hydrocarbyl group that' is linear or branched. In one embodiment the hydrocarbyl group is a linear group. In one embodiment the long chain fatty acid compounds contain 12 to 24 carbon atoms, for example mixtures of carboxylic acids containing 14 to 20 or 16 to 18 carbon atoms.   In one embodiment the aliphatic carboxylic acid contains a straight chain hydrocarbyl group. Such acids may be used in combination with acids with more or fewer carbon atoms as well. [0051]      Examples of unsaturated long chain fatty acid compounds include carboxylic acids, such as, myristoleic acid, palmitoleic acid,  oleic acid or linolenic acid. Examples of saturated fatty acids include lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behehic acid lignoceric acid or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0052] Typically the alcohol is a polyol including diols, triols, and alcohols with higher numbers of alcoholic OH groups (often referred to as polyhydric alcohols). Polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycols, including di-, tri- and tetraethylene glycols; propylene glycols, including di-, tri- and tetrapropylene glycols; glycerol; butane diol; hexane diol; sorbitol; arabitol; mannitol; sucrose; fructose; glucose; cyclohexane diol; erythritol; and pentaerythritols, including<br>
di- and tripentaerythritol.    In one embodiment the polyol includes diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, pentaerythritol or dipentaerythritol. [0053]      In one embodiment the friction modifier is a monoester of a polyol and an aliphatic carboxylic acid.   In one embodiment the monoester is glycerol monooleate.  It is to be understood that glycerol monooleate, as is the case with<br>
other such materials, in its commercially available grade, is a mixture which includes such materials as glycerol, oleic acid, other long chain acids, glycerol dioleate, and glycerol trioleate. The commercial material is believed to include about 60 + 5 percent by weight of the chemical species "glycerol monooleate," along with 35 + 5 percent glycerol dioleate, and less than about 5 percent<br>
if<br>
trioleate and oleic acid.   The amounts of the monoesters, described below, are<br>
the amounts of the commercial grade material.<br>
[0054]      In  one embodiment the  monoester of a polyol  and an aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acid is in the form of a mixture with a sunflower oil or the like, which<br>
in one embodiment is present in the friction modifier mixture from 5 to 95 wt %,<br>
in another embodiment from 10 to 90 wt %, n another embodiment from 20 to 85<br>
wt % and n another embodiment from 20 to 80 wt % of said mixture.<br>
[0055]      In one embodiment the long chain fatty acid ester is beef tallow oil,<br>
lard oil, palm oil, castor oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, peanut oil, soybean oil,<br>
sunflower oil, olive oil, whale oil, menhaden oil, sardine oil, coconut oil, palm<br>
kernel oil, babassu oil, rape oil, soya oil or linseed oil.<br>
Molybdenum Dithiocarbamate<br>
[0056]      In   one   embodiment   the friction   modifier   is   a   molybdenum<br>

[0063] Additional performance additives such as corrosion inhibitors include octylamine octanoate, condensation products of dodecenyl succinic acid or anhydride and a fatty acid such is oleic acid with a polyamine; metal deactivators including derivatives of benzotriazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles, benzimidazoles, 2-alkyldithiobenzimidazoles or 2-alkyldithiobenzothiazoles; foam inhibitors including copolymers of ethyl acrylate and 2-ethylhexylacrylate and optionally vinyl acetate; demulsifiers including polyethylene glycols, polyethylene oxides, polypropylene oxides and (ethylene oxide-propylene oxide) polymers; pour point depressants including esters of maleic anhydride-styrene, polymethacrylates, polyacrylates or polyacrylamides; and seal swell agents including Exxon Necton-37™ (FN 1380) and Exxon Mineral Seal Oil (FN 3200); may also be used in the composition of the invention.<br>
[0064] The following examples provide an illustration of the invention. These examples are non exhaustive and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Examples 1-2 and Reference Examples 1-2<br>
[0065]      A composition .is prepared by .blending additives as shown in Table 1<br>
into a 10W-40 lubricant.   The amounts in Table 1 are presented inclusive of<br>

Friction Test<br>
[0066] A friction test is carried out employing a commercially available Variable Speed Friction Test instrument. The instrument employed in the test is modified by replacing the standard lower plate with a 1998 Yamaha YZF1000 Rl motorcycle clutch plate sections. The instrument upper plate is also modified with a small diameter track to fit a shallow C shape (a 30° segment) clutch plate section of the following dimensions: 13mm wide, the long 'side' of the C is 38mm, the short side is 32mm. The instrument is operated at 100°C, with a linear slip velocity of 0.2 m/s and a load of 59 N (or 6 kgf). Before measuring friction of co-efficient, the instrument is allowed to equilibrate under the conditions mentioned above. The instrument is then run on the samples for 60 minutes. The results obtained for Examples 1 -2 and Reference Examples 1 -2 are shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0067] Overall the results show that the presence of a boron containing compound allows friction modifiers to be present in a lubricating composition for an internal combustion engine with at least one of a crankcase, a gear and a wet-clutch without excessive reduction in the coefficient of friction. [0068] In this specification the terms "hydrocarbyl substituent" or "hydrocarbyl group," as used herein are used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms and attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon atom and which does not exclude the presence of other atoms or groups in a proportion insufficient to detract from the molecule having a predominantly hydrocarbon character. In general, no more than two, in one aspect no more than one, non-hydrocarbon substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group; typically, there will be no non-hydrocarbon substituents in the hydrocarbyl group. A more detailed definition of the terms "hydrocarbyl substituent" or "hydrocarbyl group," is provided in US Patent Number 6,583,092.<br>
[0069] Each of the documents referred to above is incorporated herein by reference. Except in the Examples,- or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numerical quantities in this description specifying amounts of materials, reaction conditions, molecular weights, number of carbon atoms, and the like, are to be understood as modified by the word "about." Unless otherwise indicated, each chemical or composition referred to herein should be interpreted as being a commercial grade material. However, the amount of each chemical component is presented exclusive of any solvent or diluent oil, which may be customarily present in the commercial material, unless otherwise indicated. It is to be understood that the upper and lower amount, range, and ratio limits set forth herein may be independently combined. Similarly, the ranges and amounts for each element of the invention may be used together with ranges or amounts for any of the other elements.<br><br><br><br><br>
