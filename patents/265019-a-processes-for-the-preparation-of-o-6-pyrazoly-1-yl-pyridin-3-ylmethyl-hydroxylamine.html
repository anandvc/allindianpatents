				<td>PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF 6-11BICYCLIC ERYTHROMYCIN DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to processes and intermediates useful in the preparation of bridged erythromycin derivatives and their respective pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Macrolide antibiotics play a therapeutically important role, particularly with the emergence of new pathogens   Structural differences are related to the size of the lactone fing and to the number and nature (neutral or basic) of the sugars   Macrohdes are classified according to the size of the lactone nng (12,14,15 or 16 atoms)  The macrolide antibiotic family (14-, 15- and 16-membered nng denvauves) shows a wide range of charactenstics (antibactenal spectrum, side-effects and bioavailability) Among the commonly used macrohdes are erythromycin, clanthromycin, and azithromycm Macrohdes possessing a 3-oxo moiety in place of the 3-cladinose sugar are known as ketolides and have shown enhanced activity towards gram-negative bacteria and macrolide resistant gram-positive bactena  The search for macrolide compounds which are active against MLSB-resistant strains (MLSB = Macrohdes-Lmcosamides-type B Streptograrmnes) has become a major goal, together with retaining the overall profile of the macrohdes in terms of stability, tolerance and pharmacokmetics<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present mvention provides methods for preparing bndged macrocyclic compounds   In one embodiment of the mvention, a erythromycm denvative of formula I is reacted with a compound of formula II in the presence of a palladium (0) catalyst The mvention further relates to increasing product yield and decreasing process steps for intermediate and large scale production of bndged macrohdes<br><br>

To a solution of N-hydroxyphthalimide 6 (19 2g 115 2mmol) in anhydrous DMF (80ml) is added NaH (3 12g, 0 13 mol) and the resulting leaction mixture was stiried for 0 5 hx   The compound of Step 8c (11 15g, 57 6mmol) was idded and the lesulting mixture was stirred and heated to a temperature of 40-50°C for a penod of 3 h   The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to a tempeiature of approximately 25°C and subsequently quenched with cold watei prior to filtering the quenched solution   The precipitate was washed with cool water, dried, and redissolved in a mixture of ethyl acetate and CH2Cl2   The solution was subsequently washed with brine concentrated in vacuo to yield a yellow solid in quantitative yield<br>
Step 7e     Preparation of the title compound of formula (XI)<br>
A solution of the compound of Step 7d (32g, 0 1 mol) in 100 ml of 2M NH3 in methanol was stirred at 50 °C for 4 hours   The reaction mixtme was subsequently concentrated in vacuo and purified on silica gel to give the desired compound of formula (XT) (18 5g, 97%)<br>
Example 8      Preparation of compound of formula (TX-b)<br>
Step 8a     Addition of O-(6-Pyrazol-1-yl-pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-hydroxylamme (compound of formula (XD)<br>
To an agitated solution of the O-(6-Pyrazol-1 -yl-pyndin-3-ylmethy 1)-hydroxylamine (compound of formula (XI)) (0 32 kg) prepared in Example 7 in ethanol (2 76 L, 2 76 volumes) was added 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (2 76 L, 2 76 volumes) while maintaining a temperature below 25°C by controlling the rate of addition  The resulting reaction mixture was then cooled to a temperature between 0 to 4°C   To the cooled reaction mixture is added the title compound of Example 7 (1 00 kg) while maintaining a reaction temperature less than 5°C   After the addition had been completed, the reaction mixture was agitated for a period of 1 to 2 hrs while allowing to warm to 23°C   The reaction mixture was subsequently diluted with EtOAc (7 L, 7 volumes) and to this diluted reaction mixture was added saturated aqueous sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution (6 0 L, 6 volumes) at a temperature below 25°C until the pH of the mixture was between 8 and 9   Agitate the resulting aqueous solution at 23°C for 10 nun retaining the organic layer and extracting the aqueous phase with additional EtOAc (4 0 L, 4 volumes)   The combined organic extract is then concentrated in vacuo until only a sticky oil residue lemains   This residue was used in the subsequent step without isolation<br>
Step 8b     2' Deprotection<br>
To the residue was added methanol (5 0 L, 5 volumes) and was concentrated in vacuo azeotropically removing any remaining water until 2 L remain   This remaining solution then underwent polishing filtration and was subsequently agitated for a period of 15 hrs at a temperature of 20-23°C after which the deacetlyation reaction was complete as evidenced by HPLC   The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo until approximately 1 5 L remains  The residue was then diluted with ethanol (5 0 L, 5 volumes) and concentrated until approximately 3 5 L remain   To this residue was added purified water while maintaining a vacuum and a temperature of approximately 80°C   The vacuum was released and the aqueous solution was further agitated at 75°C while allowing to cool to a temperature of approximately 20°C over a period of 3 hrs   Once the solution had reached a temperature of 20°C, the aqueous slurry was agitated for an additional period of 2 hrs and subsequently filtered   The filtered material was washed with chilled (less than 5°C) (12) ethanol/water (0 3 L,<br>
0	3 volumes) while retaining the mother liquor and washing solution for future use<br>
After drying the crystalline material, it was dissolved once again in ethanol and<br>
recrystallized in the same manner as previously described to arrive upon the title<br>
compound   The typical yield for this three-step one pot process (oxime formation, 2'<br>
deprotection, and recrystallization) is 55%<br>
