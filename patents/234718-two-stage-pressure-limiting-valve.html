The valve member is biased to close a side spill port and a valve opening communicating with a source of high pressure. Pressure at the valve member/valve seat interface in excess of a threshold value forces the valve member away from the seat whereby a pressure relief volume of fluid is permitted to flow through the valve member itself. Sustained high pressure forces the valve member further away from the valve seat to open a side spill port and establish a larger diversion of fluid at a stable lower pressure level.</td>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"TWO-STAGE PRESSURE LIMITING VALVE"<br><br><br>
	STANADYNE CORPORATION,  a Delaware corporation of 92  Deerfield<br>
	Road, Windsor, Connecticut 06095, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
TWO-STAGE PRESSURE LIMITING VALVE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
 	The   present   invention   relates   to   fuel   pumps   and,    more<br>
particularly, to fuel pumps and common rail systems for supplying fuel at high pressure for injection into an internal combustion engine. Description of the Related Art<br>
Modern    gasoline    fueled    automotive    internal    combustion<br>
 	engines utilize a gasoline direct injection (GDI) system in which highly<br>
pressurized fuel is injected through nozzles directly into each engine cylinder. In a typical GDI system, a high-pressure (200 bar and higher) supply pump is employed which pressurizes fuel received from a low-pressure circuit (2-4 bar) including, e.g., a fuel tank and a<br>
 	low-pressure  fuel  pump.     One  such  high-pressure  supply  pump  is<br>
       described in U.S. Patent Application No. 09/342,566 filed June 29,<br>
                  M999, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention.    The<br>
                   goal of a GDI system is to inject a vaporized,  accurately metered<br>
        quantity   of   fuel   that   is   accurately   timed   for   clean   combustion.<br>
 	Accurate regulation of the pressure generated by the high pressure<br>
supply pump is essential because variations of the supply pressure to the fuel injectors will directly affect both the quantity of fuel and the quality of atomization provided during any given injection event. U.S. Patent   No.   09/638,286   filed   August   14,   2000   describes   a   self-<br>
 	regulating    gasoline    direct    injection    system    in    which    pressure<br>
detection and feedback systems are used to stabilize the supply pressure for a common rail fuel injection system. The self-regulating system monitors pressure in an accumulator for the common rail, adding pressurized fuel when rteeded and diverting the output of the<br>
 	high-pressure supply pump at a lower pressure when pressure in the<br>
accumulator is adequate. This system avoids wasteful pressurization of fuel when it is not needed, saving energy and avoiding excessive<br><br>
2<br>
heat generated by the depressurization of unnecessarily pressurized fuel.<br>
It is known that forced re-circulation of highly pressurized fuel into a high pressure supply pump for a GDI system will quickly overheat the GDI pump and possibly result in catastrophic failure. Therefore, extended periods of forced high-pressure re-circulation must be avoided.- In addition, failure of the primary pressure regulator or some other GDI component can result in pressures in the GDI system exceeding the design objectives of components resulting in leakage and/or failure.<br>
Thus, there is a need in the art for a pressure limiting valve for a GDI pump that is responsive to excessive pressure having a duration that indicates system malfunction.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved two-stage pressure limiting valve for a GDI pump that prevents pressure related failure of GDI components.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved pressure limiting valve for a GDI pump which absorbs short duration pressure spikes without affecting overall GDI system performance.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved 'two stage-pressure limiting valve for GDI pump capable of diverting the large flow of pressurized fuel resulting from failure of a primary pressure regulator or other GDI system component.<br>
These and other objects of the invention are achieved by a two-stage pressure limiting valve in accordance with the present invention. A preferred embodiment of the two-stage pressure limiting valve comprises a cup-like plunger with an integrated hemispherical ball check member positioned adjacent a complementary valve seat. The plunger is arranged for reciprocal movement in a bore defined by<br><br>
3<br>
	the pump housing. The plunger forms a barrier between a first<br>
hydraulic chamber surrounding the ball check and valve seat (the<br>
valve chamber) and a second hydraulic chamber within and beneath<br>
the plunger. The ball check end of the plunger defines a narrow gage<br>
fuel flow passage connecting the valve chamber to the interior of the<br>
plunger. A control spring disposed in the plunger bore biases the plunger and its associated ball check against the valve seat. The valve seat defines an opening which is exposed to the high-pressure output  passage  of  a  supply  pump.     A  further  hydraulic   passage<br>
 	communicates between the plunger bore and the interior of the pump<br>
housing, i.e., the sump.<br>
The plunger, plunger bore and hydraulic passage to the sump are configured to provide two alternative fluid flow paths. A first, limited volume path is defined through the narrow gage opening in<br>
 	the  plunger and  around  or through the  plunger skirt to the sump<br>
passage.   This first path does not require significant displacement of<br>
                   the plunger within its bore.   A second, large volume path is opened<br>
when the plunger is forced back in its bore against the force of the<br>
control spring.   When the plunger moves away from the valve seat a<br>
 	pre-determined distance, the outer periphery of the plunger acts as a<br>
valve to uncover the sump passage. The second, large volume path extends directly from the valve chamber into the sump passage.<br>
Under normal engine operating conditions, e.g., when fuel pressure at the output passage of the supply pump is below a pre-<br>
 	established   upper   limit,   the   ball   check   will   remain   firmly   seated<br>
against the valve seat by the bias spring. In the event of a short duration pressure spike, the ball check will lift from its seat and a small quantity of fuel to be vented into the valve chamber. The vented fluid will then pass through the narrow gage passage to the<br>
 	interior  of  the   plunger  and   subsequently   into  the   sump   passage.<br>
When the output pressure of the supply pump exceeds the pre-established   upper  limit  for  an  extended  duration,  the  narrow  gage<br><br>
4<br>
passage in the plunger is no longer capable of diverting the volume of fuel necessary to reduce pressure to an acceptable level. The excess fuel accumulates in the valve chamber, forcing the plunger away from the valve seat and opening the second large volume fuel pathway into the sump passage. The plunger will remain in this position to divert the large quantity of fuel necessary until the problem causing the excess pressure is corrected.<br>
Collapse of the control spring due to excessive pressure permits the plunger to move to a position where large quantities of fuel are re-circulated into the pump housing. This re-circulation position represents a new stable state at a much reduced pressure, e.g., 30 bar, from the normal operating pressure of the supply pump, e.g., in excess of 200 bar. The GDI electronic control unit (ECU) may be programmed to detect this new lower stable state condition and place the GDI system in a limp home mode, permitting the vehicle to be driven to the closest service station for repair of the underlying problem.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
	With reference to the drawings in which like numerals<br>
represent like parts throughout the several Figures, a two-stage<br>
	pressure limiting valve in accordance with the present invention is<br>
generally designated by the numeral 10. Figure 4 illustrates the two stage pressure limiting valve 10 in the context of a simplified gasoline direct injection system including a high pressure supply pump 8 and common rail 4.    The high pressure supply pump 8 is provided with<br>
 	low pressure fuel through a feed line 6.   Low pressure fuel is drawn<br>
from the sump 12 and pressurized by pumping means 5. High pressure fuel is fed to the common rail 4 through the high pressure output passage 14 of the pump 8. Metered quantities of fuel are released  from the pressurized  common  rail  4 into the  combustion<br>
 	chambers   of   an   internal   combustion   engine   (not   shown)   by  the<br>
injectors 2.   The two stage pressure limiting valve 10 is arranged to<br>
  	      limit the pressure delivered to the common rail 4 by diverting fluid<br>
back to the sump 12 through a low pressure sump passage 28.    A<br>
                 two-stage  pressure  limiting  valve  in   accordance  with  the  present<br>
 	invention may be used in association with any high-pressure pump<br>
whether or not the pump is equipped with a primary pressure regulator. Therefore, the configuration and operation of the high-pressure supply pump and/or primary pressure regulator will not be further discussed herein.<br>
 	A  preferred   embodiment  of  the  two-stage   pressure   limiting<br>
valve 10 may be incorporated into the housing 40 of a high-pressure supply pump (as illustrated herein) or may be provided as a separate component. The pump housing 40 defines a sump chamber 12, which is typically filled with fuel at a relatively low feed pressure of<br>
 	between 2 and 4 bar.   The pressurizing mechanism of the pump (not<br>
shown)   draws   low   pressure   fluid   from   the   sump   chamber   12,<br><br>
6<br>
pressurizes the fuel to a typical pressure of 200 bar or above, and delivers the pressurized fuel to a high pressure output passage 14.<br>
	The illustrated preferred embodiment of a two-stage pressure<br>
limiting valve  10 comprises a plunger  18,  a valve seat  16,  and a<br>
	control spring 20.   The plunger 18 and control spring 20 are arranged<br>
in a bore 25 defined by the pump housing 40. The cup-shaped plunger 18 includes a skirt 19 projecting axially away from the valve seat 16. The control spring 20 is surrounded by the plunger skirt 19 and   is   arranged  to   bias   an   integral   hemispherical   ball   check   17<br>
 	against a complementary valve seat 16.   The spring 20 is preferably<br>
a constant rate coil spring selected to minimize rail pressure variation during the first stage of valve operation. The fluid passage 22 in the valve seat 16 defines a first "active area" or area of the plunger exposed to rail pressure.   This first active area is utilized during the<br>
	first stage of valve operation.    When the volume  of fluid  passing<br>
through the fluid passage 22 exceeds the volume capacity of the<br>
v   narrow gage hydraulic passage 23, the plunger 18 is forced away<br>
from the valve seat to expose a second, larger "active area" exposed<br>
to the rail pressure.   This second active area comprises the valve end<br>
 	of  the  plunger   18.     It  will  be  understood  that  an  equivalent  rail<br>
pressure acting on the larger second active area will produce a correspondingly larger force on the plunger 18.<br>
The valve seat 1 6 defines a fluid passage 22 in communication with the high-pressure output passage  14 of the  pump.     A valve<br>
 	chamber 24 is defined at the end of the bore 25 adjacent the valve<br>
seat 16. A narrow gage hydraulic passage 23 through the plunger 18 connects the valve chamber 24 with a second hydraulic chamber 27 defined by the plunger skirt 19 and plunger bore 25. A sump passage 28 connects the bore 25 with the sump chamber 12.   One<br>
 	portion  26  of the  bore  25  has  an  enlarged  diameter,   whereby  a<br>
coaxial hydraulic passage 29 is defined between the piston skirt 19 and the pump housing 40.   The coaxial hydraulic passage 29 permits<br><br>
7<br>
fluid flow from the second hydraulic chamber 27 into the sump passage 28.<br>
		Figure  1   illustrates the  relative  positions  of the  plunger  18,<br>
valve seat 1 6, and control spring 20 under normal pump operating<br>
 conditions.   Restated, Figure 1 illustrates the relative positions of the<br>
components of the two-stage pressure limiting valve when the output pressure generated by the pump is below some pre-established maximum, e.g., 200 bar. It should be understood that fuel pressure at the high-pressure output passage 14 of the pump may frequently<br>
 	exceed the  pre-established  upper limit for brief  periods.     Figure  2<br>
illustrates the relative positions of the components of the two-stage pressure limiting valve in response to such a short duration pressure "spike".<br>
The term  "spike"  as used  in this application is defined as a<br>
 	short duration  pressure rise,  lasting for a  small  percentage of the<br>
      duration of one system cycle.    The duration of a typical  pressure<br>
     spike will be measured in microseconds, while the system cycles are<br>
typically  measured  in  milliseconds.     Spikes  are  caused  by  sudden<br>
events in the hydraulic system, for example, sudden changes in flow<br>
 	velocity, sudden change in flow direction, or the impact of a valve on<br>
its seat (creating a hydraulic pressure wave known as a "water hammer"), etc. Spikes created by these events propagate by wave motion travelling at the speed of sound through the entire hydraulic system.     Occasionally,   pressure  waves  from   different  sources   (or<br>
 	reflected   waves  from  the  same  source)   can   superimpose   on   one<br>
another, resulting in pressure spikes having an effective pressure corresponding to a multiple of the nominal system pressure. Pressure spikes are in contrast to longer lasting pressure rises typically referred to as pressure "surges".<br>
 	A pressure spike will cause the ball check  1 7 to lift from its<br>
seat 16 and vent a small amount of fuel into the valve chamber 24. From  the  valve  chamber  24,  the  vented  fuel   passes  through  the<br><br>
8<br>
narrow  gage  hydraulic  passage  23  and  into  the  second   hydraulic<br>
chamber  27.     The  vented  fuel  then  flows  radially  outwardly  and<br>
axially through coaxial passage 29 as indicated by the dashed line<br>
and arrow of Figure 2.<br>
 	Thus,   Figure   2   illustrates  the  first  stage   of  the  two-stage<br>
pressure limiting valve. During the first stage, small quantities of fuel can be vented from-the high pressure output passage 14 of the pump through the valve seat 1 6/ball check 17 interface, valve chamber 24, narrow gage  hydraulic passage 23,  second  hydraulic  chamber 27,<br>
 	coaxial  passage  29  and  sump  passage  28  to  return to the  pump<br>
sump chamber 12. When the pressure spike has passed, control spring 20 re-seats the ball check 17 against the valve seat 16, and the GDI system is permitted to continue functioning as normal.<br>
In the event of a more significant failure, for example, failure of<br>
 	the    primary    pressure    regulator    or    some    major    fuel    injection<br>
component, pressure at the high-pressure output passage 14 of the v pump may exceed the pre-established limit for an extended duration. Under  such   circumstances,  the  volume   of  fuel   that   must   be   recirculated to relieve the <br>
      overpressure condition will be greater than <br>
 	the amount of fuel that can pass through passage 23 as illustrated in<br>
Figure 2. Figure 3 illustrates the relative positions of the valve seat 16 and plunger 18 in response to a pressure surge or overpressure condition of extended duration. The initial surge of pressure will result in relative positions as illustrated in  Figure 2.    However, the<br>
 	volume of fuel entering the valve chamber 24 will exceed the volume<br>
of fuel which can pass through the narrow gage hydraulic passage 23. Therefore, the volume of fluid in chamber 24 will increase, forcing the plunger 18 away from the valve seat 16 and ultimately collapsing the control spring 2Q.<br>
 	Movement or displacement of the plunger 18 away from the<br>
valve seat 16 causes the upper shoulder of the plunger to open a second, larger fluid passage or side spill port directly from the valve<br><br>
9<br>
   chamber 24 into the sump passage 28. So long as the volume of<br>
          fluid entering the valve chamber 24 exceeds the volume of fluid<br>
          which may pass through the narrow gage hydraulic passage 23, the<br>
          relative positions of the plunger 18 and valve seat 16 will remain<br>
         those illustrated in Figure 3.   Fluid flow under these circumstances is<br>
        illustrated by the dashed line and arrow in Figure 3.<br>
If the conditions that produce excessive pressure at the pump high pressure output passage 14 are substantially permanent, the component   positions   illustrated   in   Figure   3   will   be   maintained,<br>
 	establishing a new stable state at a pressure level of preferably 25<br>
and 35 bar. As soon as the electronic control module for the GDI system detects this stable reduced pressure level, the ECU will enter a limp home mode where the injection is advanced to permit the affected vehicle to be driven to the nearest service station for repair.<br>
 	When the vehicle is turned off and the excessive flow through the<br>
valve seat orifice 22 is stopped the plunger 1 8 and associated ball v check   will   automatically   re-seat   and   normal   GDI   operation   can resume, assuming that the underlying problem has been corrected.<br>
During stage one of valve operation, the pressure is regulated<br>
 	at the valve member 1 7/valve seat 1 6 interface as a balance between<br>
the hydraulic force acting over a small exposed plunger area and a pre-determined spring force. During stage two of valve operation, the valve member is far away from the valve seat and pressure regulation occurs as a balance between hydraulic force acting over<br>
 	the larger frontal area of the plunger 18 and a slightly higher spring<br>
force exerted by the now compressed control spring 20. One working example is a high pressure supply pump having a normal output pressure of 200 bar and a two stage pressure limiting valve designed to have a threshold pressure pressure 20 to 30 bar above the normal<br>
 	output pressure of the pump.    The threshold pressure may typically<br>
be between 10 and 20% above the normal rail operating pressure.<br><br>
10<br>
The flow volumes triggering the transition between first and second stage valve operation will depend on the nominal output volume and pressure of the high pressure supply pump. Another factor is the maximum heat release (from re-circulated high pressure fuel) that can be tolerated without creating vapor cavities in the sump of the pump and/or without compromising the integrity of pump components. The relationship between the first and second flow volumes may be manipulated by selection of the following parameters: diameter of plunger 18, flow area across valve seat 16, flow area of the narrow gage hydraulic passage 23, spring rate of spring 20 as well as the location and geometry of the sump passage 28. As an initial design parameter, the transition between first and second stage valve operation may be selected to occur at approximately 10% of the nominal pump output volume at maximum speed. Although the relative percentile of this transition flow volume will increase at lower pump speeds, the total amount of released heat will also decrease. The second flow volume may be between 8 and 10 times the first flow volume.<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been set forth for purposes of illustration, the foregoing description should not be deemed a limitation of the invention herein. Accordingly, various modifications, adaptations and alternatives may occur to one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention.<br><br>

ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
A two stage pressure limiting valve comprises a valve member<br>
arranged for axial movement in a bore.   The valve member is biased<br>
to close a side spill port and a valve opening communicating with a<br>
		source of high pressure.    Pressure at the valve member/valve seat<br>
interface in excess of a threshold value forces the valve member<br>
away from the seat whereby a pressure relief volume of fluid is<br>
permitted to flow through the valve member itself. Sustained high<br>
pressure forces the valve member further away from the valve seat<br>
to open a side spill port and establish a larger diversion of fluid at a<br>
stable lower pressure level.<br><br><br></td>
