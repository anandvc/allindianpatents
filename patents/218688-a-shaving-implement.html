				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a shaving implement and more<br>
particularly to a shaving implement wherein shaving head member and<br>
rubberized composite long handle member cannot be detached.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
The disposable razor which is available in the market is embedding the<br>
blades in a plastic shaving head. It has been discovered that a twin blade<br>
shaving system in which geometrical relationships like blade tangent angle,<br>
protrusion and SPAN are maintained with critical limits, provide superior<br>
shaving characteristics. In such a shaving system, the two cutting edges are<br>
successfully active with respect to hair elements being cut during single shaving<br>
stroke. A guard structure with platform known as seat as an integral part of the<br>
handle has a fixed relation to the cutting edges. The top cap attached with<br>
lubricated strip portion which have pins on the body to locate and cover the<br>
blades revetted to the seat part to complete the shaving head. Lubra strip<br>
manufactured out of water soluble resin gives lubricating effect during shaving<br>
and improves comfort.<br>
The shaving implement of the present invention differs from<br>
conventional shaving implement in such a way that the shaving efficiency is<br>
improved and this is achieved that the shaving head assembly is made out in<br>
conjunction with the handle cap with lubricated strip and a rubber grip as an<br>
integral part of the handle.<br>
-3-<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a"<br>
shaving implement which is novel in its construction, easy to manufacture and<br>
obviates all disadvantages and drawbacks associated with the shaving systems<br>
existing in the art.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a shaving<br>
implement wherein the handle cannot be replaceable or removable from the<br>
shaving head.<br>
Yet the another object of the present invention is to provide a shaving<br>
implement wherein lubricated strip is attached to top cap and thermo plastic<br>
elestomer grip is provided to avoid slipping of handle during shaving and give<br>
extra grip.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a shaving<br>
implement comprises a shaving head member and a rubberized composite long<br>
handle member, the said shaving head member comprises: a top cap member<br>
having projected pips, a lubricating strip attached on said top cap member, a<br>
top blade, a bottom blade, a spacer member for maintaining the said top blade<br>
and said bottom blade in a spaced parallel relationship, the said rubberized<br>
composite long handle member comprises a blade support portion, a platform,<br>
guard portion and swarf slots and a rubberized grip portion wherein all the<br>
components of the said shaving head member are placed one over the other on<br>
the assembly machine and the said projected pips of the said top cap member<br>
are revetted on to the said long handle member so that shaving head member<br>
and rubberized composite long handle member cannot be detached.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings of Figures 1 to 10,13 and 14, the<br>
present invention, thus provides a shaving implement comprising a rubberized<br>
Composite long handle member(60) which accommodates shaving head (SH)<br>
components such as top cap member(20) having projected pips (PP), a top blade<br>
(30) having four square holes in the same pitch of top cap pips and swarf slots to<br>
clear the swarf, a bottom blade(40) having four square holes similar to top blade and<br>
a spacer member (50) having four round holes in the similar pitch of top blade for<br>
maintaining the said top and bottom blades in a spaced parallel relation ship wherein<br>
the above components are placed one over the other locating on the top cap pips on<br>
the machine and the said projected pips (PP) of top cap are riveted by means of cold<br>
form riveting so that the shaving head (SH) with blades cannot be detachable.<br>
-6-<br>
The rubberized composite handle member 60 has blade support portion<br>
BSS, guard portion C and swarf slots SL and rubber grip ER moulded as an<br>
integral part on injection moulding machine. The bottom blade 40 is having<br>
first cutting edges CEB and top blade 30 is having second cutting edge CET<br>
and the top and bottom cutting edges each having a blade tangent angle BTA<br>
in the range of 18-30 degree and span in the range of 0.05 to 2.00mm. The<br>
bottom blade 40 is having protrusion PROT-1 of 0.33+/-0.03 and the top<br>
blade 30 is having protrusion PROT-II of 0.07+/-0.07. The over moulded<br>
composite long handle 60 is provided with round neck N attached to the<br>
platform PF one side and long handle H with grooves on the other side also<br>
facilitates easy nesting when it is kept one over the other during packing. The<br>
rubberised composite long handle is a handle combined with a platform guard<br>
portion which are moulded integrally having specific holes for accommodating<br>
all components and also having curved ribs CR on entire length of hollow<br>
portion to give rigidity for the handles 60.<br>
Among the important geometrical relationships blade tangent angle<br>
BTA, protrusion PROT and span S1,S2 are the important parameters in the<br>
twin shaving systems. The above parameters are maintained with critical limits<br>
to provide superior shaving characteristics. In this shaving systems two blades<br>
30 and 40 are placed parallel to each other and maintain a gap of 0.4 to 0.6mm<br>
by spacing spacer member 50 in between the top and the bottom blades. Both<br>
the blades are placed in such a way that each blade having a tangent angle<br>
BTA1,BTA2 in the range of 18-30 degree and span S1 &amp; S2 in the range of 0.5<br>
to 2.00mm. The cutting edges are supported by spacer teeth point TP "FIG.6"<br>
maintained a parallel relations to one another.<br>
-7-<br>
A guard structure C is provided on the platform of the rubberized<br>
composite long handle member 60 in a fixed relation to the cutting edges to<br>
define desired geometrical relationship include the above referred blade tangent<br>
angle protrusion and span.<br>
Referring to figure 11 this is illustrated the manner in which the span S is<br>
determined. The span S of bottom blade 40 "S1" is the distance between the<br>
bottom blade cutting edge CEB and tangent point C of immediately proceeding<br>
skin engaging surface i.e. guard portion. The span S of top blade 30 "S2" is the<br>
distance between the top blade cutting edge GET and tangent point of<br>
immediately skin engaging surface i.e. bottom cutting edge. The span S1 and S2<br>
fall within the range of 0.5 — 2.00mm.<br>
Referring to figure 12 this is illustrated the manner in which the<br>
protrusion PROT is determined. The protrusion of bottom blade 40 PROT-1<br>
is determined by extending a line C-e between the tangent points immediately<br>
proceeding the following top cutting edge, i.e. from the guard tangent point C<br>
to the top blade cutting edge and parallel to the line C-e. The perpendicular<br>
distance between the lines C-e and h-h define PROT-1. The PROT-1 falls<br>
within the range 0.03-0.03mm.<br>
The protrusion of top blade 30 PROT-2 determined by extending a line<br>
a-o between the tangent point immediately proceeding the following bottom<br>
cutting edge that is from the top cap tangent point o to the bottom blade<br>
cutting edge. A line 1-j is then extended tangent to the top blade cutting edge<br>
and parallel to line a-o. The perpendicular distance between the lines a-o and<br>
1-j defines PROT-2. The PROT-2 falls within the range of 0.03+/-0.03mm.<br>
-8-<br>
The above described shaving implement offers the advantages of simple<br>
and economic construction combined with parameters of shaving geometry<br>
leading to efficient smooth safe and comfortable shaving. Among the other<br>
features the important features are the lubricated strip for comfort and smooth<br>
shave and rubberised grip of composite long handle.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described in<br>
connection with the preferred embodiments only, it will be readily apparent to<br>
these of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications may be<br>
made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined<br>
in the appended claims.<br>
