				<td>REGENERATION OF CHROMATOGRAPHIC STATIONARY PHASES.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of chromatographic purification. More specifically it pertains to a process for regenerating chromatographic stationary phases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polypeptides are increasingly being used as medicaments for the treatment of diseases within all major therapy areas. Treatment of diabetes by chronic insulin administration has been practised for more than 80 years, and therapeutic applications of polypeptides within growth disorders and cancer also have been practised for many years. Economical processes for the large scale production of polypeptides with a purity sufficiently high for therapeutic applications are crucial for further polypeptide-based therapies to reach the mass market and for the existing therapies to become more widely used.<br>
Purification of a polypeptide from a mixture is a steps which is normally used several times during the overall manufacturing process for a therapeutic polypeptide. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is the preferred method for industrial high resolution separation of polypeptides, and the method has proven versatile for the large scale purification of many polypeptides.<br>
Since polypeptides for therapeutic use are to be highly purified in order not to cause adverse events upon administration to the patient, it is quite common to use several chromatographic purification steps in the manufacturing process. The stationary phase of chromatographic columns in manufacturing plants are expensive and they are thus used for several chromatographic cycles. However, over time the performance of the chromatographic stationary phase declines, i.e. pressure drop over the column increases prohibitively and the separation factor is impaired. This has been attributed to the gradual build-up of deposits. The problem has been suggested to be overcome by a regeneration process comprising alkaline buffers (J. Chrom. 461, 1989, 45-61), e.g. pH 7.4 and high concentration of organic modifier.<br>
Brange et al. (J. Pharm. Sci. 86 (1997) 517-525) discloses dissolving insulin fibrils in acid and in base.<br><br>
For many years the problem has been alleviated by regenerating the chromatographic stationary phase with alkaline solution, e.g. 0.1 molar sodium hydroxide {vide Liliedahl, "Twelve years of silica-based HPLC purification with focus on peptides", at Tides 2000, 10 May 2000 in Las Vegas, USA). This regeneration process may increase the lifetime of silica used for purifying insulin to between 100 to 600 cycles. However, silica materials are not stable when exposed to harsh alkaline conditions, and especially substituted silica materials may not be amenable to regeneration by alkaline solutions. Economically viable processes for purifying pharmaceuticals such as therapeutic polypeptides must include a regeneration process which does not degrade the chromatographic stationary phase.<br>
A general and complex process for regenerating particulate materials (clay, sand, silica etc.) from a wide variety of sources has been disclosed in WO 00/61493. It is a 5 step process comprising contacting the material with a) an extractant of organic material, b) an oxidizing agent, followed by c) an acid solution, d) heating the material and e) recovering the material. The process is cumbersome and not amenable for implementation in a chromatographic purification plant.<br>
There is a need in the art for more efficient ways of regenerating chromatographic stationary phases so as to increase the lifetime of these expensive raw materials and prevent the pressure drop over chromatographic columns to rise. Especially, regeneration processes which are suited for in-situ regeneration of chromatographic stationary phases in manufacturing plants are needed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase wherein said chromatographic stationary phase is contacted with a regeneration solution comprising at least one organic acid and less than about 75%w/w water. The present invention is also concerned with a process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase wherein said chromatographic stationary phase is contacted with a regeneration solution comprising at least one organic acid and less than about 1%w/w water.<br><br>
The present invention is also concerned with a process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase wherein said chromatographic stationary phase is contacted with a regeneration solution having a concentration of organic acid which is at least 25%w/w. A number of organic acids may be used in the regeneration solution of the process. A preferred organic acid is formic acid. Another organic acid for the regeneration solution is acetic acid. Another regeneration solution comprises two organic acids, e.g. formic acid and acetic acid.<br>
The regeneration solution may furthermore comprise an organic solvent. Preferably the organic solvent is also used in the equilibrium buffer or chromatographic eluent. In one embodiment of the invention the organic solvent is ethanol. In another embodiment the organic solvent is 2-propanol. In another embodiment the organic solvent is acetonitrile. In another embodiment the organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, 1-propanol and hexylene glycol.<br>
In another embodiment, the organic acid is formic acid and the organic solvent is ethanol. In another embodiment, the organic acid is formic acid and the organic solvent is acetonitrile. In yet another embodiment, the organic acid is formic acid and the organic solvent is 2-propanol. In yet another embodiment, the organic acid is formic acid and the organic solvent is hexylene glycol. In another embodiment, the organic acid is acetic acid and the organic solvent is ethanol. In another embodiment, the organic acid is acetic acid and the organic solvent is acetonitrile. In yet another embodiment, the organic acid is acetic acid and the organic solvent is 2-propanol.

The chromatographic stationary phase is preferably contacted with the regeneration solution inside the chromatographic column. In this way a minimum of production capacity is lost due to down-time in connection with the regeneration step. Thus, the process of regenerating the chromatographic stationary phase can be performed without repacking the column. In one embodiment, the chromatographic stationary phase is fluidized during said regeneration. In another embodiment the chromatographic eluent or equilibrium buffer is displaced by a water miscible organic solvent before said chromatographic stationary phase is contacted with said regeneration solution. Preferably said water miscible organic solvent is also present in the<br><br>
chromatographic eluent or equilibrium buffer. Preferably said water miscible organic solvent is also present in the regeneration solution.<br>
In another embodiment the chromatographic stationary phase is contacted with said regeneration solution outside the chromatographic column. This procedure is more cumbersome than performing the regeneration process inside the column, but it may nevertheless be useful if precipitated material is trapped between the chromatographic stationary phase particle. In the latter case, the precipitated material can be removed from the chromatographic stationary phase without dissolving said material.<br>
In one embodiment the chromatographic stationary phase is a RP-HPLC matrix. The chromatographic stationary phase for RP-HPLC are mechanically very rigid materials which may be silica or substituted silica such as C4, C6, C8, C16, C18, C30 or phenyl silica, or it may be a pressure stable polymeric material which is substituted or unsubstituted. The chromatographic stationary phase, be it a silica based matrix or a polymeric material, may also be present in the columns as monolithic rods with macropores and mesopores. Suitable silica material for use as chromatographic stationary phase is spherical particles with a narrow pore size distribution and particle sizes in the range from 8µm to 30µm, such as 10pm, 13pm, 16pm, and 18pm. Typically pore sizes in the range of 60A to 300A, such as 100Ǻ, 120Ǻ, 150Ǻ or 200Ǻ, are used. For pressure stable polymeric materials the pore size may be even higher, e.g. 400A, 600A or 1000Ǻ. The chromatographic column is packed with the stationary phase and after appropriate testing of the quality of the packing, the column is equilibrated with the buffer used in the binding mode. Production scale chromatographic columns typicallly have diameters of 15 to 100 cm, and such systems have dynamic axial compression. For production of small volume polypeptides the production columns may have a diameter of e.g. 15cm, 20cm or 25cm. For production of large volume polypeptides the production columns may have a diameter of e.g. 40cm, 60cm, 80cm or larger.<br>

In another embodiment of the process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase, said chromatographic stationary phase is contacted with said regeneration solution until the pressure drop over the length of the chromatographic column at normal flow rate decreases by at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, even more preferably at least 50%.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase, contacting of said chromatographic stationary phase with the regeneration solution is performed at a temperature in the range from about 5°C to 50°C, preferably from 10°C to 40°C, more preferably from 15°C to 30°C, such as from 18°C to 25°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase, the life time of said chromatographic stationary phase is at least 500 chromatographic cycles, preferably at least 700 chromatographic cycles, more preferably at least 1000 chromatographic cycles, most preferably at least 2000 chromatographic cycles. In another embodiment of the process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase, said process is applied to said chromatographic stationary phase for every chromatographic cycle, at least once every 2 chromatographic cycles, at least once every 5 chromatographic cycles, at least once every 20 chromatographic cycles, at least once every 50 chromatographic cycles, or at least once every 100 chromatographic cycles. In another embodiment of the process for regenerating a chromatographic stationary phase, said process is applied to said chromatographic stationary phase whenever the pressure drop over the length of the chromatographic column exceeds a threshold value.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a process for the production of a therapeutic polypeptide or a precursor thereof, said process comprising at least one chromatographic step wherein the chromatographic stationary phase is regenerated by a regeneration process as described above. In one embodiment of the process for the production of a therapeutic polypeptide or a precursor thereof, said therapeutic polypeptide is a derivative comprising a lipophilic substituent. In another embodiment of the process for the production of a therapeutic polypeptide or a precursor thereof, said therapeutic polypeptide is a derivative comprising a lipophilic substituent attached to the e-amino group of a lysine residue.

The polypeptides being purified on chromatographic stationary phases regenerated by the processes of the present invention may be produced by a variety of techniques known in the art of polypeptide production. Polypeptides larger than 3000 Dalton are usually produced by fermentation or cell culture, whereas smaller polypeptide may be produced by chemical peptide synthesis. Other important factors determining the optimal production method are also the amount of polypeptide to be produced and the structure of the polypeptide, e.g. disul-<br><br>
phide bonds and other modifications. Fermentation or cell culture derived polypeptides are commonly produced by cultivation of recombinant host cells, e.g. bacteria, fungi mammalian cells, insect cells or plant cells in appropriate cultivation media. The cultivation medium may be a more or less chemically defined medium containing the necessary nutrients for growth and product formation of the host cells, e.g. sugar, nitrogen source, salts, vitamins and other growth factors. Once the microorganisms or the cells have been cultivated in the medium and they have optionally been disrupted, the cultivation medium contains the desired product in a mixture with remnant medium components, host cell derived impurities and product related impurities. Host cell derived impurities are mainly polypeptides, nucleic acids and cellular debris. The product is separated from these non-related impurities in the recovery or early purification steps. In the final purification steps (polishing) where impurities closely related to the product polypeptide are separated from the product polypeptide, chromatographic steps are extensively used.<br>
Synthesis of polypeptides may also be performed via solid phase synthesis by Merrifield-type chemistry, by solution phase methods, or by semisynthetic methods known in the art. One or more chemical conversion steps may be performed in-between the recovery and the final purification steps. Such chemical modifications may by the hydrolysis of a precursor polypeptide wherein the amino acid extension on the polypeptide is cleaved of the polypeptide. Such amino acid extensions may be used for increasing the host cell expression in the case of culture derived polypeptides, or it may be used to specifically purify the polypeptide, such as by affinity chromatography e.g. IMAC purification of histidine tagged polypeptides. The chemical conversion can also be the chemical modification to produce a polypeptide which is a derivative, e.g. by acylation, PEGylation or esterification. Such chemical modifications are well known in the art (see e.g. WO 98/08871, WO 99/43706, US 5,424286, WO 00/09666, WO 00/66629, WO 01/04156 and WO 02/90388).<br>
