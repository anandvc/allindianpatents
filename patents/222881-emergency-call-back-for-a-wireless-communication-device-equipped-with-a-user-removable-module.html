				<td>EMERGENCY CALL-BACK FOR A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION<br>
DEVICE EQUIPPED WITH A USER REMOVABLE MODULE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and a method for<br>
receiving an emergency call, and more specifically to an apparatus and a method for a<br>
wireless communication device having a removable user information module<br>
configured to receive an emergency call in a locked mode.<br>
Background Art<br>
A wireless radiotelephone, such as a cellular telephone, typically operates in a<br>
wireless network by first registering its subscriber identity such as an international<br>
mobile subscriber identity ("IMSF') and a mobile identity number ("MIN"), to the<br>
wireless network. Once registered, the cellular telephone is allowed to initiate and to<br>
receive a call in the network. In a normal mode of operation, the cellular telephone<br>
receives an incoming call by monitoring a page for the IMSI address, and accepting<br>
the incoming call if the IMSI of the page matches the IMSI of the cellular telephone.<br>
If the cellular telephone is not registered, the network may refuse a call initiated by<br>
the cellular telephone, and the cellular telephone will not be allowed to receive a call<br>
targeted to the cellular telephone. The cellular telephone may become unregistered in<br>
several ways. For example, the cellular telephone may no longer have a valid<br>
subscription with any wireless network; the cellular telephone may be in a locked<br>
mode where a user has railed to properly enter a passcode such as a personal<br>
identification number ("PIN"); the current visited network may not have roaming<br>
agreement with the subscriber's home network; or the cellular telephone may be<br>
missing a required user module such as a subscriber identification module ("SIM")<br>
card for a Global System for Mobile Communications ("GSM") type cellular<br>
telephone or a removable user identity module ("R-UIM") for a code division<br>
multiple access ("CDMA") type cellular telephone. For a SIM or R-UIM equipped<br>
cellular telephone, once the cellular telephone becomes unregistered and enters a<br>
locked mode, information contained in the SIM or R-UIM becomes inaccessible.<br>
However, an unregistered cellular telephone, or a cellular telephone in the locked<br>
mode, may still be operated in limited capability to initiate an emergency call to an<br>
emergency service center. The emergency call to the emergency service center may<br>
be identified by a prestored telephone number dedicated for emergency use, for<br>
example, 911 in the United States and 112 in Europe. However, the cellular<br>
telephone in the locked mode of operation is disallowed to receive any incoming call<br>
including a call back from the emergency service center.<br>

FIG. 2 is an exemplary flow chart of a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention in a wireless communication device;<br>
FIG. 3 is an exemplary flow chart describing one of the blocks of FIG. 2<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for a wireless<br>
communication device having a user removable module, which contains user<br>
information, for receiving an incoming call in response to initiating an emergency call<br>
to an emergency service center such as police and fire station while the wireless<br>
communication device is operating in a locked mode.<br>
The wireless communication device such as a cellular telephone may enter the<br>
locked mode by simply not having a valid service subscription with a wireless<br>
network in which the wireless communication device is currently located. The<br>
wireless communication device may also enter the locked mode by failing to receive a<br>
proper password from a user to unlock the wireless communication device to access<br>
information contained in a required user module. A subscriber identification module<br>
("SIM") card for a Global System for Mobile Communications ("GSM") type cellular<br>
telephone and a removable user identity module ("R-UIM") for a code division<br>
multiple access ("CDMA") type cellular telephone are examples of such required user<br>
modules. When the wireless communication device is operating in the locked mode,<br>
the wireless communication device is prevented from making or receiving a normal<br>
call but is allowed to initiate an emergency call to an emergency service center. The<br>
present invention enables the wireless communication device to receive an incoming<br>
call for a predefined period of time after initiating an emergency call to an emergency<br>
center.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary block diagram of a wireless communication device 100<br>
having emergency call back reception functionality in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The wireless communication device 100 may<br>
be, but is not limited to, a radiotelephone such as a cellular phone or two-way radio, a<br>
paging device, a personal digital assistant ("PDA"), a handheld computer, an<br>
audio/video device such as a television or an MP3 player, a network browsing device,<br>
a tablet for a pen, a touchpad for a finger or a pen, a touch keypad for a finger, a<br>
virtual pen, or any type of computing and communicating device having a user<br>
removable module containing user information required to operate the device. The<br>
wireless communication device 100 includes an antenna 102, a transceiver 104, a<br>
processor 106, a display 108, a user interface 110, an audio input and output 112, a<br>
memory circuit 114, a timing circuit 116, and a user removable module 118. The<br>
internal components of the wireless communication device 100 may further include a<br>
external interface 120 and a power supply 122. Accessories and additional<br>
components 124 such as a speaker phone module and hands-free kit may be coupled<br>
to the external interface 120 to provide additional functionality and capabilities to the<br>
device 100. The power supply 122, such as a battery, is controlled by the processor<br>
106, and provides power to the internal components so that they may function<br>
correctly.<br>
Generally, the wireless communication device 100 functions as described<br>
below. Upon reception of wireless signals, the wireless communication device 100<br>
detects the signals through the antenna 102 to produce detected voice and/or data<br>
signals. A receiver in the transceiver 104, coupled to the antenna 102, converts the<br>
detected signals into electrical baseband signals and demodulates the electrical<br>
baseband signals to recover incoming information, such as voice and/or data,<br>
transmitted by the wireless signals. After receiving the incoming information from<br>
the receiver in the transceiver 104, the processor 106 formats the incoming<br>
information for output to the display 108 and/or audio input and output 112.<br>
Likewise, for transmission of wireless signals, the processor 106 formats outgoing<br>
information, which may be entered through the input part of the audio input and<br>
output 112 or through the user interlace 110, and conveys it to a transmitter in the<br>
transceiver 104 for modulation of a carrier and conversion into modulated signals.<br>
The transmitter in the transceiver 104 conveys the modulated signals to the antenna<br>
102 for transmission to a remote transceiver (not shown).<br>
Input and output devices of the wireless communication device 100 may<br>
include a variety of visual, audio and/or motion devices. The output devices may<br>
include, but are not limited to, the display 108 and the audio outputs such as speakers,<br>
alarms and buzzers of the audio input and output 112. The display 108 may include<br>
liquid crystal displays, light emitting diode indicators, or any other displays. The<br>
input devices may include, but are not limited to, the user interface 110 and audio<br>
inputs of the audio input and output 112. The user input 110 may include keyboards,<br>
key pads, selection buttons, touch pads, touch screens, capacitive sensors, motion<br>
sensors, switches, or any other user inputs. The audio input of the audio input and<br>
output 112 may include a microphone or any other audio input.<br>
The internal components of the wireless communication device 100 further<br>
include the memory circuit 114 for storing and retrieving data and the timing circuit<br>
116. The processor 106 may perform various operations to store, manipulate and<br>
retrieve information in the memory circuit 114.<br>
Upon powering on, the processor 106 determines whether the wireless<br>
communication device 100 is operating in the locked mode. If the processor 106<br>
determines that the wireless communication device 100 is operating in the locked<br>
mode, the access to the information contained in the user removable module 118 is<br>
denied, and the processor 106 prevents any call from being initiated except for an<br>
emergency call. To determine whether a call is an emergency call, the processor 106<br>
compares a telephone number entered through a user interface 110 and a telephone<br>
number prestored in its memory 114 such as "911" in the United States and "112" in<br>
Europe. If the telephone number and the prestored telephone number match, then the<br>
processor 106 initiates the emergency call, and causes the transmitter in the<br>
transceiver 104 to transmit the emergency call. After the transmission of the<br>
emergency call, the processor 106 is enabled to process incoming calls upon reception<br>
by the receiver of the transceiver 104 for a predefined period of time.<br>
The processor 106 monitors whether the emergency call has received a<br>
channel assignment after the transmission of the emergency call. Upon the<br>
emergency call receiving a channel assignment, the processor 106 accesses at least a<br>
part of the information contained in the user removable module 118, and uses the<br>
information accessed to complete the call. After the emergency call is completed, the<br>
processor 106 uses the information accessed in the user removable module 118 to<br>
register the wireless communication device 100 in a local wireless communication<br>
network.<br>
Timing information regarding the predefined period of time for which the<br>
wireless communication device 100 is enabled to receive the incoming call is stored<br>
in the memory circuit 114 along with duration information specifying how long the<br>
predefined period of time has been in effect. The timing circuit 116 may include<br>
clock circuitry that provides the current time and/or a timer that provides elapsed time<br>
from a particular starting time such as a beginning of the duration of the predefined<br>
period of time. Different starting times, such as the initiation of the emergency call,<br>
the channel assignment, and the termination of the initial emergency call, may be<br>
defined as the beginning of the duration of the predefined period of time<br>
FIG. 2 is an exemplary flow chart 200 outlining the operation of the wireless<br>
communication device 100 according to a first embodiment. The process begins in<br>
block 202, and the wireless communication device 100 determines whether the<br>
wireless communication device 100 is operating in a locked mode in block 204. In<br>
the locked mode of operation, the wireless communication device is prevented from<br>
accessing user information contained in the user removable module 118, and has a<br>
limited functionality. If the wireless communication device 100 is determined not to<br>
be operating in the locked mode, then all call related processes are performed<br>
normally in block 206, and the process terminates in block 208. If the wireless<br>
communication device 100 is determined to be operating in the locked mode in block<br>
204, then upon initiating a call, which may be indicated by receiving a telephone<br>
number for the call to be made, the wireless communication device 100 determines<br>
whether the call is an emergency call in block 210. Whether the call is an emergency<br>
call may be determined by comparing the telephone number entered with a predefined<br>
telephone number for an emergency service center stored in the memory circuit 114<br>
of the wireless communication device 100. If the call is determined not to be an<br>
emergency call in block 210, men the process terminates in block 208. If the call is<br>
determined to be an emergency call in block 210, then the wireless communication<br>
device 100 transmits the call in block 212, and receives an indication permitting the<br>
wireless communication device 100 to access a certain subset of the user information<br>
contained in the user removable module 118 in block 214.<br>
Upon receiving the indication permitting to access the subset of the user<br>
information contained in the user removable module 118, the wireless communication<br>
device 100 accesses the subset of the user information in block 216, and transmits<br>
relevant information based upon the subset of the user information accessed in block<br>
218. By transmitting the relevant information and having access to certain user<br>
information contained in the user removable module 118, the wireless communication<br>
device 100 begins to operate in a mode similar to the normal operation mode, and<br>
becomes able to receive incoming calls in block 220 for a predefined period of time.<br>
The process then terminates in block 208.<br>
FIG. 3 is an exemplary flow chart further describing block 214 of FIG. 2<br>
according to the preferred embodiment. After the emergency call has been<br>
transmitted in block 212, the wireless communication device 100 monitors a channel<br>
assignment for the call in block 302, and may re-try the emergency call for a<br>
predetermined number of times in block 304 if no channel is assigned to the<br>
emergency call, i.e. if the call is unsuccessful. If the call is assigned a channel in<br>
block 302 in response to transmitting the emergency call, then in block 306, the<br>
wireless communication device 100 interprets the channel assignment for the<br>
emergency call as an indication permitting the wireless communication device 100 to<br>
access the user information contained in the user removable module 118. The<br>
wireless communication device 100 then executes a command unlocking at least a<br>
subset of the user information in block 308. The process then continues to block 216.<br>
Alternatively, the wireless communication device 100 may monitor a service connect<br>
message and/or a call acknowledgement order for the call to determine whether the<br>
call has been established instead of, or in addition to, monitoring the channel<br>
assignment for the call in block 302.<br>
FIG. 4 is an exemplary flow chart further describing block 220 of FIG. 2<br>
according to the preferred embodiment. By transmitting the relevant information<br>
based upon the subset of the user information accessed in block 218, the wireless<br>
communication device 100 is able to register in a local wireless communication<br>
network where the wireless communication device 100 is currently located in block<br>
402. By registering in the local network, the wireless communication device 100 is<br>
able begin operating in a pseudo-normal mode similar to the normal operation mode<br>
in block 404, and is able to receive incoming calls for a predefined period of time.<br>
Whether the elapsed time has exceeded the predefined period of time such as 45<br>
minutes or a certain length in time otherwise provided is checked in block 406. If the<br>
elapsed time is within the predefined period of time, the wireless communication<br>
device 100 continues to respond to incoming calls and operate in the pseudo-normal<br>
mode in block 404, and continues to monitor the elapsed time in block 406. Upon<br>
expiration of the predefined period of time, the wireless communication device 100<br>
terminates the process in block 208.<br>
Monitoring of the elapsed time may be accomplished by using an internal<br>
clock in the timing circuit 116 of the wireless communication device 100 or by<br>
receiving time information from an external time source such as a network time<br>
source. The predefined time period may be defined to run from the time the<br>
successful channel assignment is made in block 302, from the time the wireless<br>
communication device 100 is registered in the local network in block 402, or from the<br>
time the emergency call has terminated. The predefined period of time may be<br>
renewed upon initiating a new emergency call to the emergency service provider, or<br>
upon receiving a call back from the emergency service provider. The start time of the<br>
predefined time period may be stored in the internal memory 114 or in the user<br>
removable module 118. Storing the start time in the user removable module 118<br>
enables the user within the predefined time period to use a different user-removable-<br>
module-equipped communication device by placing the user removable module 118<br>
into the different user-removable-module-equipped communication.<br>
By registering to the local network, if the wireless communication device 100<br>
changes its location, it can be handed off from one cell to another without losing a<br>
communication link. It also enables the wireless communication device 100 to<br>
receive an incoming call from a source other than the called emergency service center.<br>
For example, a caller using the wireless communication device 100 makes an<br>
emergency call to a local police department, and the police department dispatches a<br>
police car. Then, a police officer in the police car will able to call back the caller the<br>
same way as a normal call without having to route the call-back through the police<br>
department to affix the call-back origin.<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention<br>
i as defined by the appended claims.<br>
