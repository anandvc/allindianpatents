				<td>ABSORBENT ARTICLE WITH MULTIPLE HIGH ABSORBENCY ZONES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present indention relates to a novel absorbent<br>
article such as a sanitary napkin having an absorbent<br>
structure which is characterized by having multiple<br>
integral high absorbency zones disposed within its<br>
thickness.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Absorbent structures are known for inclusion in<br>
disposable absorbent articles used for absorbing body<br>
fluids and other exudates. Such absorbent structures<br>
have traditionally been made from readily available and<br>
relatively inexpensive materials such as cotton fibers,<br>
wood pulp fluff, cellulosic tissue or wadding, or other<br>
absorbent fibers. These materials have provided<br>
satisfactory absorbency of fluids both in terms of<br>
absorbency rate and overall absorbent capacity.<br>
Unfortunately, absorbent structures made from such<br>
materials may tend to collapse when wetted, thereby<br>
losing some of their void volume. Such structures may<br>
also allow absorbed fluid to be squeezed back out of the<br>
structure onto the user of the absorbent article.<br>
Furthermore, when such structures have absorbed fluid,<br><br>
they may present an uncomfortable wet feeling against<br>
the skin of the user.<br>
More recently, superabsorbent polymer particles<br>
have been combined with the more traditional absorbent<br>
materials to provide structures with enhanced absorbency<br>
and retention, which may help to eliminate the above<br>
problems. Replacement of traditional absorbent materials<br>
with superabsorbent polymer particles may also allow for<br>
absorbent products to be thinner while retaining the<br>
absorbent capacity of thicker, bulkier products. A<br>
drawback to superabsorbent polymer particles, however,<br>
is their relatively high cost compared to the more<br>
traditional absorbent materials.<br>
Additionally, since superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles tend to swell as they absorb fluid, they may<br>
cause what is commonly known as gel-blocking. In other<br>
words, as fluid is absorbed by the particles of<br>
superabsorbent polymer, those particles swell and may<br>
form an occlusive layer of swollen superabsorbent<br>
particles. This occlusive layer then prevents the<br>
passage of additional fluid into the structure. Thus,<br>
the superabsorbent polymer particles must be properly<br>
placed within an absorbent structure to allow for this<br>
swelling and to most fally utilize their absorbent<br>
capacity. Generally, prevention of gel-blocking has been<br>
realized by mixing superabsorbent polymer particles with<br><br>
spacer materials, such as absorbent or nonabsorbent<br>
fibers, or by placirg the superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles toward the bottom of the absorbent structure.<br>
However, although these methods of superabsorbent<br>
polymer placement may minimize gel-blocking, they do not<br>
effect the most efficient use of the superabsorbent<br>
polymer's absorbent capacity.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is an absorbent structure<br>
with good absorbency and retention of fluid. What is<br>
also needed is an absorbent structure that helps to<br>
provide a dry feel to the skin of a user when used in an<br>
absorbent article. What is further needed is an<br>
absorbent structure with superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles spaced and placed within the structure to most<br>
fully utilize the absorbency and retention capabilities<br>
of the superabsorbent polymer particles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention	to provide<br>
an absorbent article with good absorbency and	retention<br>
of fluid that will help to provide a dry feel	to the<br>
skin of a user of the article.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide an absorbent structure with superabsorbent<br>
polymer particles spaced and placed within the structure<br><br>
to most fully utilise the absorbency and retention<br>
capabilities of the superabsorbent polymer particles.<br>
In accordance vith the present invention, there has<br>
been provided a novel absorbent structure for use in<br>
absorbent articles. The absorbent structure includes an<br>
absorbent element having an integral structure formed<br>
from absorbent fibers and super absorbent particles.<br>
The absorbent structure may optionally include<br>
additional laminate layers such as one or more layers of<br>
tissue and/or a nonwoven fabric. The nonwoven fabric may<br>
have a lower density and a higher porosity than the<br>
absorbent element of the invention to allow for rapid<br>
fluid acquisition and the subsequent transfer of the<br>
acquired fluid to an adjacent, slower absorbing, higher<br>
density absorbent element. Alternatively, the nonwoven<br>
fabric may have a higher density and a lower porosity<br>
than the absorbent element to increase fluid wicking<br>
throughout the nonwoven fabric. Preferably, lower-<br>
density nonwoven fabrics are placed adjacent the body-<br>
facing surface of an absorbent element, and higher-<br>
density nonwoven fabries are placed adjacent the<br>
garment-facing surface of an absorbent element.<br>
The absorbent structure of the invention has<br>
peripheral edges and a center region. The center region<br>
is that portion of the structure which is inward from<br>
the peripheral edges of the structure and which is<br><br>
intended to accept incoming fluid when the structure is<br>
used in an absorbent article. The absorbent element<br>
also has peripheral edges and a center region (as<br>
described above). The peripheral edges of the absorbent<br>
element may be coterminous with the peripheral edges of<br>
the absorbent structure or may be inward from or extend<br>
beyond the peripheral edges of the absorbent structure.<br>
The absorbent element has an upper surface and a<br>
lower surface defining therebetween an absorbent element<br>
thickness. The absorbent element further has an integral<br>
structure and further includes a first high absorbency<br>
zone and a second high absorbency zone separated from<br>
one another by a portion of the element thickness. Each<br>
of the first and second high absorbency zones comprises<br>
an integral mixture of absorbent fibers and<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles and has a first surface<br>
and a second surface. As used herein, the terminology<br>
"integral" means a unitary structure wherein the<br>
absorbent fibers are intermeshed throughout the entire<br>
absorbent element. Thus, there are no identifiable<br>
laminate layers which are separable from other layers<br>
within the element. Consequently, the surfaces of the<br>
high absorbency zones are not, per se, identifiable<br>
surfaces. As used herein, the terminology "surface" as<br>
it relates to each of the high absorbency zones<br>
represents the location at which a transition occurs<br>
from a section of the integral structure substantially<br><br>
free of superabsorbent polymer particles to a section of<br>
the integral structure containing a mixture of absorbent<br>
fibers and superabsorbent polymer particles.<br>
The first surface of the first high absorbency zone<br>
may optionally be coplanar with the upper surface of the<br>
absorbent element, or alternatively, the first high<br>
absorbency zone may be below or spaced from the upper<br>
surface of the absorbent element wherein the upper<br>
surface is substantially free of superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles and contains only absorbent fibers. Subjacent<br>
to the first high absorbency zone is a second high<br>
absorbency zone, each zone having a respective<br>
thickness. The thickness of the first high absorbency<br>
zone may be the same as or different from the thickness<br>
of the second high absorbency zone. Preferably, the<br>
thickness of each of the first and second high<br>
absorbency zones comprises less than about 35% of the<br>
thickness of the absorbent element. More preferably, the<br>
thickness of each of the first and second high<br>
absorbency zones comprises less than 20% of the<br>
thickness of the absorbent element. The first high<br>
absorbency zone is separated from the second high<br>
absorbency zone by a portion of the absorbent element<br>
thickness which is substantially free of superabsorbent<br>
particles. Additionally, the portions of the absorbent<br>
element that are outside of the first and second high<br><br>
absorbency zones are substantially free of<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles.<br>
The superabsorbent polymer particles are mixed with<br>
absorbent fibers within the first and second high<br>
absorbency zones. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles are uniformly and<br>
homogeneously mixed with the absorbent fibers within the<br>
first and second high absorbency. Alternatively, the<br>
superabsorbent particles may be distributed within one<br>
or both of the first and second high absorbency zones on<br>
an increasing gradient wherein the concentration of<br>
superabsorbent particles increases from a minimum at the<br>
first surface of the high absorbency zone to a maximum<br>
at the second surface of the high absorbency zone, or a<br>
decreasing gradient, wherein the concentration of<br>
superabsorbent particles decreases from a maximum at the<br>
first surface of the high absorbency zone to a minimum<br>
at the second surface of the high absorbency zone.<br>
Alternatively, the superabsorbent particles can be<br>
distributed in a manner such that a maximum<br>
concentration of these particles occurs in a region<br>
centered at approximately half the distance between the<br>
first surface and the second surface of one or both of<br>
the high absorbency zones.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment the upper surface of<br>
the absorbent element is substantially free of<br><br>
superabsorbent particles, the first high absorbency zone<br>
being slightly below the upper surface of the absorbent<br>
element wherein the upper surface of the absorbent<br>
element comprises 100% absorbent pulp fibers.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there has<br>
been provided an absorbent structure utilized in<br>
absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins, diapers,<br>
incontinence articles and the like. An embodiment of<br>
such an article comprises the absorbent element of the<br>
invention contained between a liquid-permeable body-<br>
facing layer and a liquid-impermeable barrier layer and<br>
positioned such that the body-facing layer is adjacent<br>
the upper surface of the absorbent element and the<br>
impermeable barrier layer is adjacent the lower surface<br>
of the absorbent element.<br>
Also provided in accordance with the present<br>
invention is a novel apparatus for intermittently<br>
applying a particulate material to a substrate, the<br>
apparatus comprising two applicator valve assemblies,<br>
each applicator valve assembly comprising a stationary<br>
funnel having an opening and positioned within a<br>
moveable housing such that the moveable housing is free<br>
to move relative to the stationary funnel, the moveable<br>
housing comprising at least one slot opening and at<br>
least one recycle hols spaced from the slot opening,<br>
wherein the moveable housing moves relative to the<br><br><br>
stationary funnel to provide an application phase to<br>
allow passage of particulate material by free-fall<br>
through the stationary funnel opening and the slot<br>
opening when the stationary funnel opening aligns with<br>
the slot opening, and a recycle phase to prevent<br>
dispensing of particulate material onto the substrate<br>
when the stationary funnel opening aligns with the at<br>
least one recycle hole.<br>
Also provided in accordance with the present<br>
invention is a novel method for intermittently applying<br>
particulate material to a substrate comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
-	providing a substrate;<br>
-	providing a continuous supply of first<br>
particulate material from a first supply source<br>

application phase to allow passage of first<br>
particulate material by free-fall therethrough;<br>
-	dispensing the first particulate material through<br>
the first valve onto at least a portion of a<br>
surface of the substrate;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the<br>
invention will become clear from the following detailed<br>
description, appended drawings, and non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
The present invention is directed to novel<br>
absorbent articles such as, for example, sanitary<br>
napkins, having a central absorbent structure adapted to<br>
receive and retain body exudates. More particularly,<br>
the absorbent articles of the present invention have a<br><br>
novel absorbent structure which includes an absorbent<br>
element having an integral structure formed from a<br>
combination of absorbent fibers and super absorbent<br>
particles and further including a first high absorbency<br>
zone located adjacent an upper surface of the absorbent<br>
element and a second high absorbency zone spaced below<br>
and vertically separated from the first high absorbency<br>
zone by a portion of the absorbent element thickness.<br>
The absorbent articles will generally have a body<br>
facing, liquid-permeable cover layer, a garment-facing,<br>
liquid-impermeable barrier layer, and an absorbent<br>
structure between the body-facing layer and the barrier<br>
layer. The absorbent structure may optionally include a<br>
multi-layer laminate structure having one or more layers<br>
of nonwoven fabrics and/or tissue in addition to the<br>
absorbent element. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
absorbent structure comprises an upper, body facing<br>
fluid transfer layer formed from a nonwoven fabric and<br>
an underlying absorbent element between the fluid<br>
transfer layer and the barrier layer. The fluid transfer<br>
layer preferably has a porosity that is greater than the<br>
porosity of the absorbent element.<br>
The absorbent element has a center region and<br>
peripheral edges, and an upper surface and a lower<br>
surface defining therebetween an absorbent element<br>
thickness. The absorbent element has a first high<br>
absorbency zone having a first high absorbency zone<br><br>
first surface and a first high absorbency zone second<br>
surface separated by a first high absorbency zone<br>
thickness (hereinafter "first zone thickness"), and a<br>
second high absorbency zone having a second high<br>
absorbency zone first surface and a second high<br>
absorbency zone second surface separated by a second<br>
high absorbency zone thickness (hereinafter "second zone<br>
thickness"). The first high absorbency zone first<br>
surface may optionally be coplanar with the upper<br>
surface of the absorbent element or alternatively it may<br>
be slightly below the upper surface wherein the region<br>
between the upper surface and the first high absorbency<br>
zone first surface is substantially free of<br>
superabsorbent particles. The second high absorbency<br>
zone is spaced below the first high absorbency zone such<br>
that the first high absorbency zone second surface is<br>
separated from the second high absorbency zone first<br>
surface by a portion of the absorbent element thickness<br>
which is substantially free of superabsorbent particles.<br>
The novel absorbent structure of the present<br>
invention is intended for use in disposable absorbent<br>
articles. These articles are adapted to be placed in a<br>
crotch portion of an undergarment and worn by the user<br>
in direct contact with the body for the purpose of<br>
absorbing body fluids and are subsequently thrown away<br>
after a single use.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a sectional<br>
view of a first preferred embodiment of the absorbent<br>
element 1 of the present invention. Figure 1 shows an<br>
integral absorbent element 1 with an upper surface 2 and<br>
a lower surface 4 defining therebetween an absorbent<br>
element thickness 6. The absorbent element further has a<br>
first high absorbency zone 8 and a second high<br>
absorbency zone 10 separated from one another by a<br>
portion 12 of the absorbent element thickness. Both the<br>
first high absorbency zone and the second high<br>
absorbency zone comprise a mixture of absorbent fibers<br>
14 and superabsorbent polymer particles 16. The<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles are substantially<br>
contained within the first and second high absorbency<br>
zones, and the portion 12 of the absorbent element<br>
thickness separating the first and second high<br>
absorbency zones is substantially free of superabsorbent<br>
polymer particles. It can be seen in a preferred<br>
embodiment illustrated by Figure 1 that an upper surface<br>
2 is substantially free of superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles 16, and that the superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles 16 are separated from one another by absorbent<br>
fibers 14 within the first and second high absorbency<br>
zones 8, 10.<br>
The first high absorbency zone has a first high<br>
absorbency zone first surface 18 and a first high<br>
absorbency zone second surface 20 defining therebetween<br><br>
a first high absorbency zone thickness 22. The second<br>
high absorbency zone has a second high absorbency zone<br>
first surface 24 and a second high absorbency zone<br>
second surface 26 defining therebetween a second high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 28. Each of the first high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 22 and the second high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 28 preferably comprises less<br>
than 35% of the absorbent element thickness 6. The first<br>
high absorbency zone thickness 22 may be the same as or<br>
different from the second high absorbency zone thickness<br>
28.<br>
The absorbent fibers of the present absorbent<br>
element may comprise any absorbent fiber known in the<br>
art, including without limitation, naturally occurring<br>
fibers or synthetic fibers. Examples of naturally<br>
occurring absorbent fibers are wood pulp, cotton, silk,<br>
hemp and the like, while examples of synthetic absorbent<br>
fibers include without limitation rayon fibers,<br>
individualized cross-linked cellulose fibers, acrylic<br>
fibers, and the like. A preferred absorbent fiber for<br>
the absorbent element of the invention is wood pulp<br>
fluff.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term<br>
"superabsorbent polymer" refers to materials which are<br>
capable of absorbing and retaining at least about 10<br>
times their weight in body fluids under a 0.5 psi<br><br>
pressure. The superabsorbent polymer particles of the<br>
invention may be inorganic or organic crosslinked<br>
hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
polyethylene oxides, crosslinked starches, guar gum,<br>
xanthan gum, and the like. The particles may be in the<br>
form of a powder, grains, granules, or fibers. Suitable<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles for use in the present<br>
invention are crosslinked polyacrylates, such as the<br>
product offered by Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd. Of<br>
Osaka, Japan, under the designations of J550™, SA60N<br>
Type II™, SA60SL™, and SA60SX™, and the products<br>
offered by Chemdal International, Inc. of Palatine,<br>
Illinois, under the designations of Chemdal 1000™,<br>
2000™, 2100™, 2100A™, and 2300™. Suitable<br>
superabsorbent fibers are manufactured by Oasis Inc. and<br>
Camelot Inc.<br>
Although a wide range of superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles would work in this invention, preferred<br>
superabsorbent particles are those that are well suited<br>
to being mixed at concentrations by weight of 30% or<br>
more with pulp fibers without exhibiting gel-blocking.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, each high<br>
absorbency zone may contain between 10% and 80% by<br>
weight of superabsorbent particles. It is not necessary<br>
that the first and second high absorbency zones contain<br>
the same percentage or even the same type of<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles. In some cases, it may<br><br>
be preferable for the first high absorbency zone to<br>
contain a smaller percentage of superabsorbent particles<br>
of a first type, and for the second high absorbency zone<br>
to contain a higher percentage of superabsorbent<br>
particles of a second type. In the preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention the superabsorbent particles are<br>
present in each high absorbency zone at a loading of<br>
between 30 and 55 grams per square meter.<br>
The absorbent element according to the present<br>
invention may also comprise other absorbent or<br>
nonabsorbent materials, such as binders, nonabsorbent<br>
fibers, odor controlling particles, or perfumes.<br>
Examples of suitable binder materials include without<br>
limitation, ethylene vinyl acetate based latex binders,<br>
adhesives, and thermally fusible fibers, such as<br>
bicomponent fibers. Examples of suitable nonabsorbent<br>
fibers include without limitation, polyester fibers,<br>
polyolefin fibers, and bicomponent fibers.<br>
Absorbent elements according to the present<br>
invention are commonly formed by air-laying the fibers<br>
and superabsorbent polymer particles. A preferred method<br>
of forming the absorbent element of the invention<br>
involves first forming pulp fluff from a pulp board in a<br>
hammer mill or similar equipment designed to fiberize or<br>
separate and "open" the pulp fibers in the board. The<br>
separated pulp fibers are then entrained in an air<br><br>
stream and deposited on a foraminous surface to form a<br>
pulp batt or pad. The pulp batt or pad thus formed is a<br>
collection of individual fibers in a very loose<br>
configuration. The fiorous batt is substantially<br>
uncompressed, leaving spaces between the fibers that<br>
comprise the batt. Superabsorbent polymer particles that<br>
are added to the loose batt fall into these spaces<br>
between the fibers. The superabsorbent polymer particles<br>
may be added to a portion of the air-entrained fibers<br>
for deposition substantially throughout the thickness of<br>
a first or a second high absorbency zone. Alternatively,<br>
the superabsorbent polymer particles may be deposited<br>
directly onto a formed pulp batt at the desired points<br>
in the pulp deposition process to ensure that the<br>
superabsorbent particles are located at the desired<br>
zones within the thickness of the structure. In the<br>
former case, the particles are mixed with pulp fibers<br>
throughout the high absorbency zones of the integral<br>
absorbent structure. In the latter case, the particles<br>
fall into the spaces between the absorbent fibers to<br>
form fairly concentrated high absorbency zones within<br>
the integral absorbent structure with absorbent fibers<br>
separating the particles in each zone. In either case,<br>
the particles within each zone are separated from one<br>
another by fibers. In a preferred embodiment, absorbent<br>
fibers are laid over the top of the first high<br>
absorbency zone so that the upper surface of the<br>
absorbent element is substantially free of<br><br>
superabsorbent polymer particles. In all cases, however,<br>
the superabsorbent polymer particles are substantially<br>
separated from one another by intermeshed pulp fibers<br>
within the first and second high absorbency zones to<br>
maintain the integral structure of the absorbent<br>
element.<br>
The first high absorbency zone located adjacent the<br>
upper surface of the absorbent element may extend across<br>
the entire upper surface 2 of absorbent element 1 or<br>
alternatively, may be confined to one or more particular<br>
localized regions of the absorbent element, such as for<br>
example, being located solely in a central region and<br>
spaced inwardly away from the peripheral edges of the<br>
absorbent element. Likewise, the second high absorbency<br>
zone may extend from one peripheral edge to an opposite<br>
peripheral edge of the absorbent. Alternatively, the<br>
second high absorbency zone may be confined to one or<br>
more particular localized regions of the absorbent<br>
element, such as, for example, being located solely in a<br>
central region and spaced inwardly from the peripheral<br>
edges of the absorbent element, or being located only<br>
along one or more of the peripheral edges of the<br>
absorbent element. In further embodiments, one or both<br>
of the first and second high absorbency zones may<br>
comprise multiple discrete regions substantially<br>
separated from one another.<br><br>
The thickness of the absorbent structure may be<br>
uniform throughout the expanse of the absorbent element<br>
or, for the purpose of specific fit, flexibility and<br>
absorbency requirements, the absorbent structure may<br>
have a tapered profile wherein certain areas of the<br>
structure, such as a central region, are thicker than<br>
other areas.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the second high absorbency<br>
zone may be surrounded by boundaries, such as densified<br>
channels 50. In this embodiment, the first high<br>
absorbency zone 8 is coextensive with the absorbent<br>
element upper surface 2. The second high absorbency zone<br>
10 is completely contained in a centrally located region<br>
52 between the channels 50. The boundaries may also<br>
comprise other structural elements, such as raised areas<br>
measuring a greater thickness or caliper than the<br>
surrounding areas; repellent-treated areas; embossed or<br>
depressed areas measuring a lesser caliper or thickness<br>
than the surrounding areas; colored areas having inks or<br>
other coloring agents printed thereon or being otherwise<br>
treated to exhibit a color that is visually perceptible<br>
as different from the color of the surrounding areas or<br>
the edges of the absorbent structure. Alternatively, the<br>
top surface of the absorbent structure may be partially<br>
covered by a film or other impermeable material, leaving<br>
only a central opening uncovered.<br><br>
An important feature of the present invention is<br>
that the entire absorbent element, including the first<br>
and second high absorbency zones, be an integral<br>
structure, wherein the absorbent fibers that comprise<br>
the absorbent element are continuously intermingled with<br>
the absorbent fibers that comprise the first and second<br>
high absorbency zones, and no discernible laminate or<br>
separate structure is present. In other words, the<br>
superabsorbent-containing first and second high<br>
absorbency zones are not formed as nor are they present<br>
as separable layers within the absorbent element;<br>
rather, they are simply regions of varying absorbency<br>
within the absorbent element. An advantage of this<br>
integral type of structure is that it remains a single<br>
whole structure during the absorption of fluid, and<br>
consequently, it is not subject to delamination or<br>
gapping as fluid is absorbed. Such gapping or<br>
delamination disrupts the fluid transport and<br>
distribution capabilities of the structure and may<br>
diminish its overall absorbency. An integral absorbent<br>
structure also allows for a simpler process of absorbent<br>
article construction.<br>
The absorbent element shown in Figure 2 is an<br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention. Figure<br>
2 shows an integral absorbent element 1 with an upper<br>
surface 2 and a lower surface 4 defining therebetween an<br>
absorbent element thickness 6. The absorbent element<br><br>
further has a first high absorbency zone 8 and a second<br>
high absorbency zone 10 separated from one another by a<br>
portion 12 of the absorbent element thickness. Both the<br>
first high absorbency zone and the second high<br>
absorbency zone comprise absorbent fibers 14 and<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles 16. The superabsorbent<br>
polymer particles are substantially contained within the<br>
first and second high absorbency zones, and the portion<br>
12 of the absorbent element thickness separating the<br>
first and second high absorbency zones is substantially<br>
free of superabsorbent polymer particles. It can be seen<br>
in the embodiment illustrated by Figure 2 that the upper<br>
surface 2 is substantially free of superabsorbent<br>
polymer particles 16, and that the superabsorbent<br>
polymer particles 16 are separated from one another by<br>
absorbent fibers 14 in the first and second high<br>
absorbency zones 8, 10.<br>
The first high absorbency zone has a first high<br>
absorbency zone first surface 18 and a first high<br>
absorbency zone second surface 20 defining therebetween<br>
a first high absorbency zone thickness 22. The second<br>
high absorbency zone las a second high absorbency zone<br>
first surface 24 and a second high absorbency zone<br>
second surface 2 6 defining therebetween a second high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 28. Each of the first high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 22 and the second high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 28 preferably comprises less<br><br>
than 35% of the absorbent element thickness 6. The first<br>
high absorbency zone thickness 22 may be the same as or<br>
different from the second high absorbency zone thickness<br>
28.<br>
Figure 2 also shows the presence of two densified<br>
channels 50, which may be compressed into the absorbent<br>
element after its formation. The channels define<br>
centrally located region 52 therebetween. Each channel<br>
50 has inner edges 54 and a lowermost portion or bottom<br>
56. Each channel defiles a side portion 58 of the<br>
element which includes the portion of the element that<br>
is outboard of the channel 50, that is, that portion of<br>
the article that is between the channel 50 and the<br>
outside edge 62 of the element. These side portions 58<br>
may contain superabsorbent or they may be free of<br>
superabsorbent. In the preferred embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 2, the first high absorbency zone extends into<br>
the side portions 58, but the second high absorbency<br>
zone is confined to the centrally located region 52<br>
between the channels 50.<br>
Neither the first nor the second high absorbency<br>
zone needs to be continuous. As shown in Figure 3,<br>
absorbent element 1 contains absorbent fibers 14, super<br>
absorbent particles 16 and two densified channels 50,<br>
the first high absorbency zone 8 and the second high<br>
absorbency zone 10 may both have discontinuous regions.<br><br>
This type of configuration may be preferred in some<br>
cases to prevent gel-blocking and to allow fluid to pass<br>
quickly into the absorbent element when the fluid first<br>
enters the absorbent element.<br>
The number of high absorbency zones within the<br>
absorbent element of the invention need not be limited<br>
to two. Accordingly, three or more high absorbency<br>
zones may be present throughout the thickness of the<br>
absorbent element. The sectional view of the embodiment<br>
of the absorbent element shown in Figure 4 has three<br>
high absorbency zones all separated from one another by<br>
a portion of the thickness of the absorbent element. In<br>
the embodiment of Figure 4, a first high absorbency zone<br>
8 contains a smaller percentage of superabsorbent<br>
particles than a second high absorbency zone 10, which<br>
contains a smaller percentage of superabsorbent<br>
particles than a third high absorbency zone 64. This<br>
arrangement may be desirable to minimize gel-blocking<br>
and to allow most of the absorbed fluid to be retained<br>
further from the upper surface of the absorbent element.<br>
The sectional view of the embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 5 shows four high absorbency zones with the first<br>
high absorbency zone 8, the third high absorbency zone<br>
64, and fourth high absorbency zone 66 extending nearly<br>
to the peripheral edges of the absorbent element. The<br>
second high absorbency zone 10 in Figure 5 is<br><br>
substantially confined to the center of the absorbent<br>
element. This configuration may be desirable in<br>
applications where more absorbency is required in the<br>
center of the article.<br>
The absorbent article 100 shown in Figure 6 is a<br>
sectional view of a first preferred embodiment of the<br>
absorbent article of the present invention. The<br>
absorbent article 100 of Figure 6 has an integral<br>
absorbent element 1 comprising a first high absorbency<br>
zone 8 and a second high absorbency zone 10 separated<br>
from one another by a portion 12 of the absorbent<br>
element thickness. The first high absorbency zone has a<br>
first high absorbency zone first surface 18 and a first<br>
high absorbency zone second surface 20 defining<br>
therebetween a first high absorbency zone thickness 22.<br>
The second high absorbency zone 10 has a second high<br>
absorbency zone first surface 24 and a second high<br>
absorbency zone second surface 2 6 defining therebetween<br>
a second high absorbency zone thickness 28. As discussed<br>
above, the first and second high absorbency zones are<br>
integrally formed with the absorbent element and thus<br>
the first surfaces 18, 24 and the second surfaces 20, 26<br>
are not, per se, identifiable surfaces. Rather, they are<br>
marked by an absence of any superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles. The absorbent element 1 comprises absorbent<br>
fibers 14 and superabsorbent polymer particles 16. The<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles 16 are substantially<br><br>
contained within the first high absorbency zone<br>
thickness 22 and the second high absorbency zone<br>
thickness 28. It can be seen in the preferred embodiment<br>
illustrated by Figure 6 that the upper surface 2 is<br>
substantially free of superabsorbent polymer particles<br>
16, and that the superabsorbent polymer particles 16 are<br>
mixed with absorbent fibers 14 in the first high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 22 and the second high<br>
absorbency zone thickness 28. The integral absorbent<br>
element is overlaid with a fluid transfer layer 70 and<br>
positioned between a liquid permeable, body-facing layer<br>
72 and a liquid impermeable, barrier layer 74 such that<br>
the upper surface 2 is adjacent the fluid transfer layer<br>
70, which is adjacent the body-facing layer 72. The<br>
body-facing layer 72 and the barrier layer 74 are joined<br>
to one another around the periphery of the absorbent<br>
element to form what Ls commonly known as a flange seal<br>
76.<br>
The absorbent article 110 shown in Figure 7 is a<br>
sectional view of a second preferred embodiment of the<br>
absorbent article of the present invention. The<br>
absorbent article 110 of Figure 7 has an integral<br>
absorbent element comprising a first high absorbency<br>
zone 8 and a second high absorbency zone 10 essentially<br>
as shown in Figure 2 and described in detail above. As<br>
shown in Figure 7, the integral absorbent element of<br>
Figure 2 is positioned between a liquid permeable, body-<br><br><br>
facing layer 72 and a liquid impermeable, barrier layer<br>
74 such that the absorbent element upper surface 2 is<br>
adjacent the body-facing layer 72. The body-facing layer<br>
72 follows the shape of the upper surface to line the<br>
inner edges 54 of the channels. The body-facing layer 72<br>
may be connected or secured to the bottom 56, or<br>
lowermost portion, of the channel 50, as shown in Figure<br>
7. The body-facing layer 72 and the barrier layer 74 are<br>
joined to one another around, the periphery of the<br>
absorbent element to form what is commonly known as a<br>
flange seal 76.<br>
Although the articles 100 and 110 shown in Figures<br>
3 and 4 respectively have the body-facing layer 72 and<br>
the barrier layer 74 joined together by a flange seal<br>
76, this is for illustrative purposes only. The presence<br>
of a flange seal is not necessary to achieve the<br>
benefits and advantages of the invention. Alternatively,<br>
the body-facing layer of the absorbent article may be<br>
wrapped completely around the absorbent element and<br>
overlapped and sealed to itself on the underside of the<br>
article. The barrier layer may be present either between<br>
the absorbent element and the overlapped portion of the<br>
body-facing layer, or on the outer surface of the<br>
overlapped portion of the body-facing layer. Other<br>
methods of securing a body-facing layer and a barrier<br>
layer to an absorbent article structure will be apparent<br><br><br>
to those who are familiar with the construction of<br>
absorbent articles.<br>
The body-facing cover layer may comprise any soft,<br>
flexible, porous material which allows liquid to pass<br>
therethrough, and may, for example, be comprised of a<br>
nonwoven fibrous sheet or an apertured or perforated<br>
plastic film. Examples of suitable nonwoven fibrous<br>
sheets include without limitation, carded webs, spunbond<br>
webs, meltblown webs, random-laid webs, and the like.<br>
The fibers comprising such webs may comprise polyester,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, rayon, or combinations of<br>
these. The webs may further comprise bonding agents,<br>
surfactants, or other treatments. A preferred material<br>
for the body-facing layer of the invention is a<br>
homogeneous blend of high denier polypropylene staple<br>
fibers and low denier polypropylene staple fibers. The<br>
high denier staple fibers and the low denier staple<br>
fibers preferably differ by 2 denier, where the low<br>
denier staple fibers preferably have a denier of about 3<br>
and the high denier staple fibers preferably have a<br>
denier of about 5. The high denier staple fibers are<br>
present in the non-woven fabric in an amount of from 40<br>
to 60 weight percent. The low denier staple fibers are<br>
present in the non-woven fabric in an amount of from 40<br>
to 60 weight percent based on the total weight of the<br>
non-woven fabric.<br><br>
The barrier layer is a liquid-impermeable layer,<br>
and may comprise any flexible material that prevents the<br>
transfer of fluid but does not necessarily prevent the<br>
passages of gases. Commonly used materials are<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene films. Other suitable<br>
polymeric film materials that may be used as impermeable<br>
barriers include, but are not limited to polyesters,<br>
polyamides, polyethylene vinyl acetate, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, and polyvinylidene chloride, and the like and<br>
combinations thereof. Co-extruded and laminated<br>
combinations of the foregoing, wherein such combinations<br>
are permitted by the chemical and physical properties of<br>
the film, may be used. Fluid impermeable foams and<br>
repellent treated papers may also be used. Films that<br>
are fluid barriers, bat permit gases to transpire, i.e.,<br>
"breathable films", may be used. These may be chosen<br>
from polyurethane films and from micro-porous films,<br>
where micro-porosity Ls created by ionizing radiation or<br>
by leaching out of soluble inclusions using aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous solvents. Fabrics whose surfaces have been<br>
made repellent or whose pores are small by virtue of<br>
close packing of fibers, or whose pores have been<br>
reduced in size by closing off large liquid admitting<br>
pores, may also be used alone, or together with<br>
breathable films, as breathable barriers.<br>
A suitable backing sheet material can be an opaque<br>
polyolefin, e.g., polyethylene, web impermeable to body<br><br>
fluids and about 0.0C1 inch thick. Another suitable<br>
sheet material for this purpose is a polyester, e.g.,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, web having a thickness of<br>
about 0.0005 inch.<br>
Figure 8 is a perspective view of a preferred<br>
embodiment of an absorbent article of the invention,<br>
more specifically this absorbent article is a sanitary<br>
napkin. This figure illustrates one embodiment of the<br>
positioning of densified channels 50 and the resulting<br>
centrally located region 52.<br>
A preferred apparatus for making the absorbent<br>
structure of the invention is illustrated in Figure 9.<br>
With reference to Figure 9, the absorbent element of the<br>
present invention may be prepared according to the<br>
following method. While any of the absorbent fibers as<br>
previously discussed nay be used to form the absorbent<br>
element, for purposes of illustration, wood pulp fibers<br>
are used to describe the preferred apparatus. The wood<br>
pulp of the absorbent element is supplied in raw<br>
material form as a conpressed sheet, or pulp board 150,<br>
that is wound on a roll. The pulp unwind 151 allows the<br>
board to be fed into a pulp mill 152, where a high speed<br>
hammer rotor opens the board into substantially<br>
individual wood pulp fibers of about 2.5 mm average<br>
length, commonly known as pulp fluff or ground wood<br>
pulp. Air is pulled through the pulp mill and the<br><br><br>
adjacent forming chamber 153 by a forming wheel vacuum<br>
154. This air conveys the pulp fluff to a forming wheel<br>
155 and into a mold 156. The molds 156 are cavities in<br>
the forming wheel surface spaced around the<br>
circumference of the forming wheel 155. The bottom of<br>
the molds comprises a porous screen to allow the air to<br>
be pulled through the molds, leaving the pulp fluff<br>
deposited on the screen.<br>
The molds are mounted on the forming wheel which<br>
rotates clockwise. When the molds first enter the<br>
forming chamber at position A, they are empty. In the<br>
Initial Fiber Deposition Zone 157, 100% pulp fibers are<br>
deposited on the bottom of the molds 156. The thickness<br>
of pulp deposited in the Initial Fiber Deposition Zone<br>
comprises 5% to 25% of the final thickness of the<br>
absorbent element, and it acts as a filter to hold the<br>
granular superabsorbent polymer powder that will be<br>
deposited in the mold. The boundaries of the Initial<br>
Fiber Deposition Zone 157 are formed by the left side of<br>
the forming chamber 153 and the left side of the seal<br>
for the first Particle Application Zone 158.<br>
The first Particle Application Zone 158 comprises a<br>
rotary particle applicator valve 159 that dispenses a<br>
predetermined amount of particles into the pulp fluff in<br>
each mold. The particles are applied in a pattern that<br>
is phased with the molds to form the first high<br><br><br>
absorbency zone. Although the first high absorbency zone<br>
shown in this embodiment is generally rectangular, the<br>
shape of the first high absorbency zone is not limited<br>
to rectangular. Any shape of first high absorbency zone<br>
may be used and one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
discern that varying first high absorbency zone shapes<br>
may be desirable or even preferable for varying shapes<br>
and types of absorbent elements.<br>
The molds then enter an Intermediate Fiber<br>
Deposition Zone 160 wherein additional pulp covers the<br>
first high absorbency zone.<br>
The second Particle Application Zone 158' is<br>
similar to the first Particle Application Zone 158 as it<br>
comprises a second rotary particle applicator valve 159'<br>
that dispenses a predetermined amount of particles onto<br>
the pulp fluff applied in each mold in the Intermediate<br>
Fiber Deposition Zone 160. The particles are applied in<br>
a pattern that is phased with the molds to form the<br>
second high absorbency zone, and in this embodiment,<br>
such that the second high absorbency zone is<br>
substantially centered in the mold. Preferably, the<br>
second high absorbency zone is spaced at least 3 mm<br>
inwardly from the peripheral edges of the mold. Most<br>
preferably, the second high absorbency zone is spaced at<br>
least 7 mm inwardly from the peripheral edges of the<br>
mold, and therefore, also at least 7 mm from the<br><br>
peripheral edges of the absorbent element contained<br>
therein. Although the second high absorbency zone shown<br>
in this embodiment is generally rectangular, the shape<br>
of the second high absorbency zone is not limited to<br>
rectangular nor is it limited to the same shape as the<br>
first high absorbency zone. Any shape of second high<br>
absorbency zone may bo used and one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will discern "hat varying second high absorbency<br>
zone shapes may be desirable or even preferable for<br>
varying shapes and types of absorbent elements.<br>
The molds then enter the Final Fiber Deposition<br>
Zone 161 wherein additional pulp covers the second high<br>
absorbency zone thereby forming an integral absorbent<br>
element. The molds are slightly overfilled with pulp,<br>
and two scarfing brushes 162 are used to make the pulp<br>
even with the top of the mold. The absorbent elements<br>
are then vacuum transferred out of the molds onto the<br>
Vacuum Transfer Drum 163, from which they may then be<br>
transferred to another forming station for incorporation<br>
into absorbent products.<br>
Figures 10A, 10B, 11A, 11B, and 12, illustrate the<br>
operation of the first and second Rotary Particle<br>
Application Valves 159 and 159' in greater detail. Since<br>
the first and second Rotary Particle Application Valves<br>
159 and 159' are substantially identical in operation,<br>
detailed reference will be made to the first Rotary<br><br><br>
Particle Application Valve 159 as it operates in the<br>
first Particle Application Zone 158. It will be<br>
understood that the second Rotary Particle Application<br>
Valve 159' in the second Particle Application Zone 158'<br>
will function in the same manner as the first Rotary<br>
Particle Application Valve 159.<br>
Figures 10A and LOB show an axial view and a side<br>
view respectively of first Rotary Particle Application<br>
Valve 159 in the particle application phase. In order to<br>
achieve a precise pattern of particles on each mold 156,<br>
first Rotary Particle Application Valve 159 is used as a<br>
means to start and stop the flow of particles to the<br>
molds 156. Particles are delivered to the first Rotary<br>
Particle Application Valve 159, in the first Particle<br>
Application Zone 158. Preferably, the particles are<br>
delivered via a first gravimetric feeder, such as a<br>
loss-in-weight (LIW) screw feeder 170 to accurately<br>
control the particle weight applied to each mold 156.<br>
The first particle supply source 172 is located outside<br>
of the first Particle Application Zone. The discharge<br>
end of the screw feeder 170 is located within a<br>
stationary funnel 174 of the first Rotary Particle<br>
Application Valve. The stationary funnel is housed<br>
within the rotor 176 of the first Rotary Particle<br>
Application Valve. The rotor 17 6 comprises at least one<br>
rotor slot opening 173. The widths of the stationary<br>
funnel 174, the rotor slot opening 178, and the<br><br>
discharge end of the screw feeder 170 are matched to the<br>
width of the desired pattern of particles to be formed<br>
on each mold, which determines the shape of the first<br>
high absorbency zone. As the rotor 176 turns, and the<br>
rotor slot opening 178 aligns with the discharge end of<br>
the screw feeder 170, the superabsorbent polymer<br>
particles 16 contained in the stationary funnel drop by<br>
gravity onto the mold 156. The forming wheel vacuum 154<br>
assists with the drawing of the particles downward onto<br>
the mold 156. Preferably, a portion of the screen bottom<br>
of each mold 156 is also masked such that an opening<br>
remains having the desired pattern shape. This<br>
selective masking of the pulp molds enhances the<br>
accurate and precise placement of the particles within<br>
the pulp mold. The length of the rotor slot 178 dictates<br>
the length of the pattern of particle forming the first<br>
high absorbency zone 8 of the absorbent element 1.<br>
Figures 11A and MB show an axial view and a side<br>
view respectively of the first Rotary Particle<br>
Application Valve 159 in the recycle phase. In Figures<br>
11A and 11B, the forming wheel 155 is shown in a<br>
position such that the first Rotary Particle Application<br>
Valve 159 is located over a portion of the wheel between<br>
two molds 156. It is desired to prevent the deposition<br>
of particles over this portion of the wheel, since any<br>
particles dispensed in this position are essentially<br>
wasted and serve only to contaminate the area<br><br><br>
surrounding the apparatus. The recycle phase shown in<br>
Figures 11A and 11B prevents the problems associated<br>
with unwanted disposition of particles by recycling the<br>
particles. When the first Rotary Particle Application<br>
Valve 159 is in the recycle phase as shown, the position<br>
of the rotor 176 under the stationary funnel 174<br>
prevents the passage of particles; i.e., the rotor slot<br>
178 is in a closed position. Particles exiting the first<br>
screw feeder 170 hit the inside diameter of the rotor. A<br>
rotor vacuum port 180 in the side of the rotor opens to<br>
the rotor inside diameter through a series of recycle<br>
holes 182 in the rotor and pulls the particles out of<br>
the rotor and into a recycling tube 184. As shown in<br>
Figure 12, the particles are then conveyed by air<br>
through the recycling tube 184 to a recycle receiver 202<br>
that will eventually provide the particles back to the<br>
first screw feeder 170 for reuse. Also shown in Figure<br>
12 is a detailed view of the first particle supply<br>
source 172, including both the virgin supply reservoir<br>
204 and the recycle receiver 202.<br>
Likewise, the second Rotary Particle Applicator<br>
Valve 159' in the second particle Application Zone 158'<br>
functions similarly. Third and fourth and more rotary<br>
particle applicator valves may also be added in a<br>
similar manner to produce absorbent elements with more<br>
