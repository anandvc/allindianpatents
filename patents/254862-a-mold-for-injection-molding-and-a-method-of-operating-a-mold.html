				<td>The present invention relates to a mold for injection molding and a method of operating a mold.<br>
The present invention relates to a mold for injection molding provided with a fixed mold and a movable mold and to a method of operating a mold for injection molding.<br>
Generally, in the resin injection molding, a molded article is taken out after having the following steps (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H05-245888 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H11-151735).<br>
(1)	Molding step of filling a molten resin into a cavity in a mold with a fixed mold and a movable moid closed, and cooling the resin to solidify it.<br>
(2)	Mold-opening step of separating the movable mold from the fixed mold.<br>
(3)	Take-out step of driving an ejector pin located at its initial position to displace it to a thrust-out position, thereby taking a molded article out of the mold.<br>
(4)	Returning step of returning the ejector pin to the initial position.<br>
(5)	Mold-closing step of moving the movable mold toward the fixed mold to close the mold.<br>
In the case of performing the above steps, the take-out step has to follow the mold-opening step. Thus, both a time required to open the mold and a time required to take out the molded article are needed, which tends to make a molding cycle longer. Further, since an ejecting device provided with a hydraulic cylinder in a molding apparatus causes the ejector pin to project, a space for installing such an ejecting device has been necessary.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problems and an object thereof is to shorten a molding cycle and to preferably make a mold and a molding apparatus smaller.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by a mold according to claim 1 and by a method of operating a mold according to claim 8. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a mold for injection molding, comprising:<br>
a fixed mold,<br>
a movable mold arranged to be movable with respect to the fixed mold,<br>
an ejector member for thrusting out a molded article attached to the movable mold, and<br>
an ejector plate which movable with respect to the movable mold and supports the ejector pin,<br>
wherein the fixed mold includes an engaging member, and the engaging member (directly and/or indirectly) engaging or interfering with the ejector plate in the process of separating the movable mold at the time of opening the mold, whereby the ejector plate is moved forward relative to the movable mold- to<br>
cause a leading end portion of the ejector member to at least partly project from the movable mold.<br>
In the process of separating the movable mold, the engaging member of the fixed mold (directly/indirectly) interferes with or engages the ejector plate, whereby the ejector plate is moved relative to the movable mold and the ejector member at least partly projects from the movable mold. Thus, the molded article can be taken out during a mold opening step, making it unnecessary to take the molded article in a separate step. As a result, a molding cycle can be shortened. Further, since the ejector member is thrust out from the movable mold due to the interference or engagement of the engaging member and the ejector plate, it is not necessary to separately provide an ejecting device for moving the ejector member forward and backward, thereby advantageously enabling the mold and a molding apparatus to be made smaller.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the engaging member projecting toward the movable mold.<br>
Preferably, the ejector plate which is so incorporated into or mounted to the movable mold as to be movable forward and backward.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a mold for injection molding, comprising:<br>
a fixed mold,<br>
a movable mold arranged to be movable toward and away from the fixed mold,<br>
an ejector pin for thrusting out a molded article attached to the movable mold, and<br>
an ejector plate which is so incorporated into the movable mold as to be movable forward and backward while supporting the ejector pin,<br>
wherein the fixed mold includes an engaging pin projecting toward the movable mold, and the engaging pin interferes with the ejector plate in the process of separating the movable mold at the time of opening the mold, whereby the ejector plate is moved forward relative to the movable mold to cause a leading end portion of the ejector pin to project from the movable mold.<br>
The movable mold is separated from the fixed mold after a molten resin is filled into a cavity space formed when the fixed mold and the movable mold are closed, and cooled to be solidified. In the process of separating the movable mold, the engaging pin of the fixed mold interferes with the ejector plate, whereby the ejector plate is moved forward relative to the movable mold and the leading end portion of the ejector pin projects from the movable mold. Thus, the molded article can be taken out during a mold opening step, making it unnecessary to take the molded article in a separate step. As a result, a molding cycle can be shortened. Further, since the ejector pin is thrust out from the movable mold due to the interference of the engaging pin and the ejector plate, it is not necessary to separately provide an ejecting device for moving the ejector pin forward and backward, thereby enabling the mold and a molding apparatus to be made smaller.<br>
Preferably, the ejector plate is formed with an engaging hole through which a shaft portion of the engaging member is at least partly insertable, and a projecting portion which (preferably radially) projects from shaft portion, preferably has a diameter larger than the inner diameter of the engaging hole, and can interfere with the opening edge of the engaging hole of the ejector plate is formed at the leading end of the shaft portion of the engaging member.<br>
Further preferably, the ejector plate is formed with an engaging hole through which a shaft portion of the engaging pin is at least partly insertable, and a large-diameter portion which has a diameter larger than the inner diameter of the engaging hole and can interfere with the opening edge of the engaging hole of the ejector plate is formed at the leading end of the shaft portion of the engaging pin.<br>
The large-diameter portion which has a larger diameter than the inner diameter of the engaging hole of the ejector plate and can interfere with the opening edge of the engaging hole of the ejector plate is provided at the leading end of the shaft portion of the engaging member or engaging pin. Thus, the engagement member or engaging pin preferably directly comes substantially into engagement with the ejector plate, thereby securing the thrusting-out movement of the ejector member or ejector pin.<br>
Still further preferably, the movable mold is formed with an insertion hole for permitting the entrance and exit of the leading end of the engaging member or engaging pin thereinto and therefrom preferably by communicating with the engaging hole.<br>
Since the movable mold is formed with the insertion hole for permitting the entrance and exit of the leading end of the engaging member or engaging pin thereinto and therefrom by communicating with the engaging hole, the engaging member or engaging pin needs not be entirely accommodated in the mold. As a result, the mold can be made even smaller by being made thinner.<br>
Still further preferably, the ejector plate is held substantially in contact with the movable mold by the biasing force of a biasing member unless being moved relative to the movable member due to the engagement of the engaging member with the ejector plate.<br>
Most preferably, the engaging member comprises a coupling portion so as to be dismountable or separable into two or more pieces.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a method of operating a mold, in particular according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, for injection molding for thrusting out a molded article attached thereto, the comprising a fixed mold, a movable mold arranged to be movable with respect to the fixed mold and an ejector member, the method comprising the following steps:<br>
moving the movable member with respect to the fixed mold so as to at least partly open the mold, and<br>
moving the ejector member for thrusting out a molded article attached to the mold by (directly and/or indirectly) engaging or interfering an ejector plate which is movable with respect to the movable mold and supports the ejector<br>
member with an engaging member provided on the fixed mold, whereby the ejector plate is moved forward relative to the movable mold to cause a leading end portion of the ejector member to at least partly project from the movable mold.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises a step of holding the ejector plate substantially in contact with the movable mold by the biasing force of a biasing member unless the ejector plate is moved relative to the movable member due to the engagement of the engaging member with the ejector plate.<br>
Preferably, the leading end of the engaging member is at least partly inserted into and retracted from an insertion hole of the movable mold.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings. It should be understood that even though embodiments are separately described, single features thereof may be combined to additional embodiments.<br>
FIG. 1 is a section showing a closed state of a mold for injection molding according to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
FIG. 2 is a section showing a state where a molten resin is filled into a cavity,<br>
FIG. 3 is a section showing an intermediate state of the separation of a movable mold from a fixed mold, and<br>
FIG. 4 is a section showing a thrust-up state.<br>
Hereinafter, one preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 4. A mold for injection molding according to this embodiment is, as shown in FIG. 1, provided with a fixed mold 10 and a movable mold 20 arranged to be movable toward and away from or with respect to the fixed mold 10 and adapted to form or define a cavity space 30 in cooperation with the fixed mold 10 at the time of closing the mold.<br>
The fixed mold 10 includes a fixed platen 11 fixed to a molding apparatus, a fixed mounting plate 12 mounted or mountable on the fixed platen 11, and a fixed molding plate 13 mounted or mountable on this fixed mounting plate 12. The fixed platen 11 is formed with a through hole 14 through which an injection nozzle 40 at least partly passes, whereas the fixed mounting plate 12 is formed with a resin inflow opening 15 communicating with the through hole<br>
14	and preferably having a concave or converging surface. A gate or passage 16 preferably having a smaller diameter extends from the resin inflow opening<br>
15	through the fixed molding plate 13 to substantially communicate with the cavity space 30.<br>
In the fixed mold 10, one or more engaging pins 17 projecting toward the movable mold 20 are provided at one or more positions preferably substantially opposed to each other with or substantially point symmetric with respect to the center of the fixed mold 10 located preferably substantially in the middle. Each engaging pin 17 includes a shaft portion 17A extending substantially straight along its longitudinal direction, a collar 17B bulging out from the base end or base end portion of the shaft portion 17A and at least partly exposed at a<br>
surface of the fixed mounting plate 12 substantially facing the fixed platen 11, and a large-diameter portion 17C formed at the leading end of the shaft portion 17A to bulge out and engageable with an ejector plate 50 to be described later. The shaft portions 17A of the engaging pins 17 have such a length as to penetrate from the fixed mold 10 to the movable mold 20 substantially along the thickness direction TD or the opening and closing direction OCD of the molds 10, 20. Further, a coupling portion 17E preferably provided with a screw fastening function is formed at an intermediate position (preferably substantially a middle position) with respect to the longitudinal direction of the shaft portion 17A of each engaging pin 17, and the engaging pin 17 can be divided at this coupling portion 17E.<br>
One or more guiding bars 60 extending toward the movable mold 20 substantially in parallel with the shaft portions 17A of the engaging pins 17 at the outer sides of the fixed mounting plate 12 and the fixed molding plate 13 are secured or securable to the fixed platen 11.<br>
The movable mold 20 is made movable by the one or more guiding bars 60 between a mold-closing position where the movable mold 20 is in contact with the fixed molding plate 13 and a mold-opening position spaced apart from the mold-closing position. The movable mold 20 includes a movable platen 21, a movable mounting plate 22 mounted or mountable on the movable platen 21, a movable molding plate 23 spaced apart from the movable mounting plate 22 by a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) distance, and a spacing portion 24 to be provided between the movable molding plate 23 and the<br>
movable mounting plate 22. An accommodating section 70 for the ejector plate 50 is provided in an inner space held to have a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) dimension by the spacing portion 24.<br>
The ejector plate 50 preferably is constantly biased in a direction away from the fixed mold 10 by a biasing means preferably comprising one or more spring portions 80 such as compression coil springs incorporated into the accommodating section 70 of the movable mold 20 in such a manner as to be movable forward and backward substantially along the longitudinal direction or the opening and closing direction OCD and at least partly provided between the ejector plate 50 and the movable molding plate 23. One or more, preferably a plurality of ejector members or pins 90 projecting toward the fixed mold 10 are provided at positions preferably substantially opposed to each other with or substantially point symmetric with respect to the center of the ejector plate 50 substantially in the middle, and the base ends thereof are fixedly supported on or mounted to the ejector plate 50.<br>
The ejector plate 50 is formed with one or more engaging holes 52 at positions substantially corresponding to the engaging pins 17. Each engaging hole 52 has an inner diameter substantially equal to the outer diameter of the shaft portion 17A so that the shaft portion 17A can be at least partly inserted through the engaging hole 52, and one end thereof substantially communicates with the accommodating section 70. The other end of each engaging hole 52 communicates with a recess 53 which is formed to preferably have a diameter substantially larger than that of the engaging hole 52 and substantially exposed<br>
toward the movable mounting plate 22. The large-diameter portion 17C of the engaging pin 17 comes substantially into contact with the bottom surface of the recess 53 substantially corresponding to the opening edge of the engaging hole 52 in the process of separating the movable mold 20 from the fixed mold 10 during the mold opening. The movable mold 20 is moved further backward or substantially away from the fixed mold 10 while the large-diameter portions 17C of the engaging pins 17 and the bottom surfaces of the recesses 53 interfere with each other, whereby the ejector plate 50 is moved forward relative to the movable mold 20 against biasing forces of the spring portions 80.<br>
The movable molding plate 23 is formed with one or more through holes 23A, through which the shaft portions 17A of the engaging pins 17 are loosely insertable, at positions substantially corresponding to the engaging pins 17. A surface of the movable molding plate 23 substantially facing the cavity space 30 serves as an attachment surface 23B to which a molded article S is to be attached, whereas spring holding portions 23C for at least partly accommodating contracted spring portions 80 are formed in a surface of the movable molding plate 23 substantially facing the accommodation space. The movable molding plate 23 is also formed with one or more guiding holes 23E for guiding the respective ejector pins 90. The leading ends of the ejector pins 90 are located substantially in flush with or (preferably slightly) retracted from the attachment surface 23B of the movable molding plate 23 when the mold is closed. At the time of opening the mold, the ejector plate 50 is moved forward relative to the movable plate 20 due to the interference of the engaging pins 17<br>
and the ejector plate 50 in the process of separating the movable mold 20 from the fixed mold 10, whereby the leading ends of the ejector pins 90 at least partly project from the attachment surface 23B of the movable molding plate 23.<br>
The movable mounting plate 22 and the movable platen 21 are formed with one or more insertion holes 29 penetrating both of them in thickness direction TD and substantially communicating with the respective recesses 53 of the ejector plate 50. Leading end portions of the engaging pins 17 can at least partly enter and exit from the insertion holes 29 as the movable mold 20 makes a relative movement. The inner diameter of the insertion holes 29 preferably is substantially equal to that of the recesses 53, whereby the large-diameter portions 17C of the engaging pins 17 are at least partly insertable into the insertion holes 29. The insertion holes 29, the engaging holes 52, the recesses 53, the through holes 23A are substantially coaxially arranged along the corresponding shaft portions 17A of the engaging pins 17.<br>
Next, the functions of this embodiment are described.<br>
First, the mold is closed by moving the movable mold 20 toward the fixed mold 10. In this mold-closed state MCS, as shown in FIG. 1, the cavity space 30 is defined between the movable molding plate 23 of the movable mold 20 and the fixed molding plate 13 of the fixed mold 10; the ejector plate 50 is held substantially in contact with the movable mounting plate 22 of the movable mold 20 by the biasing forces of the one or more spring portions 80 as a preferred biasing member; and the large-diameter portion(s) 17C of the engaging pin(s) 17 are at least partly exposed to outside through the insertion<br>
holes 29 of the movable platen 21. Since the engaging pins 17 can be divided into leading-end portions and base-end portions preferably with the coupling portions 17E as boundaries, the leading-end portions and the base-end portions can be coupled to each other if the leading-end portions are at least partly inserted into the mold through the insertion holes 29 and the large-diameter portions 17C are connected or fixed (preferably screwed) after the mold is substantially closed.<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 2, a molten resin as a preferred molding material is injected from the injection nozzle 40 to be filled into the cavity space through the resin inflow opening 15 and the gate 16, and cooled to be substantially solidified or cured. Then, the movable mold 20 is slid substantially along the guiding bars 60 by an unillustrated driving mechanism to be separated from the fixed mold 10. At the start of moving the movable mold 20, a displacement of the ejector plate 50 relative to the movable mold 20 is prevented since the engaging pins 17 do not interfere with the ejector plate 50. When the movable mold 20 is displaced by a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) amount, preferably by about substantially half the entire movement stroke, the large-diameter portions 17c of the engaging pins 17 reach positions where they interfere with the bottom surfaces of the recesses 53 of the ejector plate 50 as shown in FIG. 3. Then, the ejector plate 50 is moved forward relative to the movable mold 20 by a further backward movement of the movable mold 20, and the ejector pins 90 supported on the ejector plate 50 gradually project from the attachment surface 23B of the<br>
movable mold 20. When the ejector plate 50 preferably substantially reaches a mold opening position where it is held substantially in contact with the movable molding plate 23 of the movable mold 20, the molded article S is thrust up or away from the movable mold 20 by the ejector pins 90 and can be taken out. If the molded article S is taken out and the movable mold 20 is brought closer to the fixed mold 10 thereafter, the ejector plate 50 is automatically returned to the initial position where it is in contact with the movable molding plate 22 of the movable mold 20 by the biasing forces of the spring portions 80.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, the engaging pins 17 projecting from the fixed mold 10 interfere with the ejector plate 50 in the process of separating the movable mold 20 from the fixed mold 10 at the time of opening the mold, whereby the ejector plate 50 is moved forward relative to the movable mold 20 and the leading ends of the ejector pins 90 project from the movable mold 20. Thus, the molded article S can be taken out in the mold opening step, making it unnecessary to take the molded article S out in a separate step. As a result, the molding cycle can be shortened. Further, since the ejector pins 90 project from the movable mold 20 due to the interference of the ejector plate 50 and the engaging pins 17, it is not necessary to separately provide an ejecting device for moving the ejector pins 90 forward and backward, thereby enabling the mold and the molding apparatus to be made smaller.<br>
Further, the large-diameter portion(s) 17C preferably having a larger diameter than the inner diameter of the respective engaging hole(s) 52 of the<br>
ejector plate 50 is/are provided at the leading ends of the shaft portion(s) 17A of the engaging pin(s) 17, and can interfere with the bottom surface(s) of the recesse(s) 53 of the ejector plate 50. Thus, the engaging pin(s) 17 directly come(s) into engagement with the ejector plate 50, thereby securing the projecting movements of the one or more ejector pins 90.<br>
Since the movable mold 20 is formed with the one or more insertion holes 29 for permitting the at least partial entrance and exit of the leading ends of the engaging pin(s) 17 thereinto and therefrom by communicating with the engaging hole(s) 52 via the recess(es) 53, the engaging pin(s) 17 need(s) not be entirely accommodated in the mold. As a result, the movable mold 20 can be made thinner to make the mold even smaller.<br>
Accordingly, to shorten a molding cycle and to make a mold and a molding apparatus smaller, a fixed mold 10 is provided with one or more engaging pins 17 (as a preferred engaging member) projecting toward a movable mold 20. Each engaging pin 17 includes a shaft portion 17A and a large-diameter portion 17C formed at the leading end of the shaft portion 17A to bulge out. In the process of separating the movable mold 20 at the time of opening a mold, the large-diameter portions 17C of the engaging pins 17 interfere or engage an ejector plate 50, preferably with the bottom surfaces of recesses 53 of the ejector plate 50, whereby the ejector plate 50 is moved forward relative to the movable mold 20 and leading end portions of ejector pins 90 project from the movable mold 20. Other Embodiments<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. Beside the following embodiments, various changes can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the claims.<br>
(1)	According to the present invention, one or more engageable pins or members may at least partly project from the ejector plate substantially toward the fixed mold and the one or more engaging pins may catch the respective engageable pins in the process of separating the movable mold from the fixed mold at the time of opening the mold.<br>
(2)	According to the present invention, only one engaging pin or member may project from the fixed mold. Conversely, two or more pairs of engaging pins or members may at least partly project therefrom.<br>
(3)	According to the present invention, it is sufficient for the ejector plate to be formed with a portion which can interfere with the engaging pin, and the one or more recesses may not be formed.<br>
(4)	Even though in the preferred embodiment the shaft portion 17A is provided with the large diameter portion 17C, it should be understood that the invention also covers an embodiment in which a projecting portion such as a pin or the like projection radially projects from shaft portion 17A so as to engage the ejector plate, preferably an edge portion of the engaging hole 52.<br>
