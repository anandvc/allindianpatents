WILTON, CONNECTICUT 06897-4122,<br>
U.S.A.<br><br><br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to moisture-curable silylated resin-containing compositions having reduced gas permeability and methods of using these compositions. The compositions are particularly well suited for use in the window area as an insulating glass sealant and in applications such as coatings, adhesives and gaskets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Moisture-curable compositions are well known for their use as sealants. In the manufacture of Insulating glass units (IGU), for example, panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with a gas or mixture of gases of low thermal conductivity.<br>
Current room temperature curable (RTC) silicone sealant, while effective to some extent, still have only a limited ability to prevent the loss of low thermal conductivity gas, e.g., argon, from the inner space of an IGU. Over time, the gas will escape reducing the thermal insulation effectiveness of the IGU to the vanishing point.<br>
A need therefore exists for an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability compared to that of known RTC compositions. When employed as the sealant for an IGU, an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability will retain the intra- panel insulating gas of an IGU for a longer period of time compared to that of a more permeable RTC composition and therefore will extend the insulating properties of the IGU over a longer period of time.<br>
-2-<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that moisture-curable silylated resin-containing composition combined with modified filler has low permeability to gas or mixtures of gases. The composition is especially suitable for use as a sealant-where high gas barrier properties together with the desired characteristics of softness, processability and elasticity are important performance criteria.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a moisture-curable silylated resin-containing composition comprising:<br>
a)	moisture-curable silylated resin, which upon curing, provides a cured resin exhibiting permeability to gas;<br>
b)	at least one organic nanoclay; and, optionally,<br>
c)	at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of cured resin (a).<br>
When used as a gas barrier, e.g., in the manufacture of an IGU, the foregoing composition reduces the loss of gas(es) thus providing a longer service life of the article in which it is employed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a moisture-curable silylated resin-containing composition is provided comprising: a) moisture-curable silylated resin, which upon curing, provides a cured resin i.e., hydrolyzed and subsequently crosslinked silylated polyurethane (SPUR) resin, exhibiting permeability to gas in intimate admixture with; b) at least one organic nanoclay; and, optionally, c) at least<br>
-3-<br><br>
one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of cured resin (a).<br>
The compositions of the invention are useful for the manufacture of sealants, coatings, adhesives, gaskets, and the like, and are particularly suitable for use in sealants intended for insulating glass units.<br>
The moisture-curable silylated resin (a) which can be employed in the present invention are known materials and in general can be obtained by (i) reacting an isocyanate-terminated polyurethane (PUR) prepolymer with a suitable silane, e.g., one possessing both hydrolyzable functionality, such as, alkoxy etc., and active hydrogen-containing functionality such as mercaptan, primary and secondary amine,, preferably the latter, etc., or by (ii) reacting a hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer with a suitable isocyanate-terminated silane, e.g., one possessing one to three alkoxy groups. The details of these reactions, and those for preparing the isocyanate-terminated and hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymers employed therein can be found in, amongst others: u.s. Patent Nos. 4,985,491, 5,919,888, 6,207,794, 6,303,731, 6,359,101 and 6,515,164 and published U.S. Patent Application Nos. 2004/0122253 and 2005/0020706 (isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,786,081 and 4,481,367 (hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymers); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,627,722, 3,632,557, 3,971,751, 5,623,044,5,852,137,6,197,912 and 6,310,170 (moisture-curable SPUR obtained from reaction of isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymer and reactive silane, e.g., aminoalkoxysilane); and, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,345,053, 4,625,012, 6,833,423 and published U.S. Patent Application 2002/0198352 (moisture-curable SPUR obtained from reaction of hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer and isocyanatosilane). The entire contents of the foregoing U.S. patent documents are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The moisture-curable silylated resin (a) of the present invention may also be obtained by (iii) reacting isocyanatosilane directly with polyol.<br>
-4-<br><br>
(a) Moisture-curable SPUR Resin Obtained From Isocyanate-terminated PUR Prepolymer<br>
The isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers are obtained by reacting one or more polyols, advantageously, diols, with one or more polyisocyanates, advantageously, diisocyanates, in such proportions that the resulting prepolymers will be terminated with isocyanate. In the case of reacting a diol with a diisocyanate, a molar excess of diisocyanate will be employed.<br>
Included among the polyols that can be utilized for the preparation of the isocyanate-terminated. PUR prepolymer are polyether polyols, polyester polyols such as the hydroxyl-terminated polycaprolatones, polyetherester polyols such as those obtained from the reaction of polyether polyol with e-caprolactone, polyesterether polyols such as those obtained from the reaction of hydroxyl-terminated polycaprolactones with one or more alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadienes, and the like.<br>
Specific suitable polyols include the polyether diols, in particular, the poly(oxyethylene) diols, the poly(oxypropylene) diols and the poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) diols, polyoxyalkylene triols, polytetramethylene glycols, polyacetals, polyhydroxy polyacrylates, polyhydroxy polyester amides and polyhydroxy polythioethers, polycaprolactone diols and triols, and the like. In one embodiment of the present invention, the polyols used in the production of the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers are poly(oxyethylene) diols with equivalent weights between about 500 and 25,000. In another embodiment of the present invention, the polyols used in the production of the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers are poly( oxypropylene) diols with equivalent weights between about 1,000 to 20,000. Mixtures of polyols of various structures, molecular weights and/or functionalities can also be used.<br>
-5-<br><br>
The polyether polyols can have a functionality up to about 8 but advantageously have a functionality of from-about 2 to 4 and more advantageously, a functionality of 2 (i.e., diols). Especially suitable are the polyether polyols prepared in the presence of double-metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts, an alkaline metal hydroxide catalyst, or an alkaline metal alkoxide catalyst; see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,829,505, 3,941,849, 4,242,490, 4,335,188, 4,687,851, 4/985,491, 5,096,993, 5,100,997, 5,106,874, 5,116,931, 5,136,010, 5,185,420, and 5,266,681; the entire contents of which are incorporated here by reference. Polyether polyols produced in the presence of such catalysts tend to have high molecular weights and low levels of unsaturation, properties of which, it is believed, are responsible for the improved performance of inventive retroreflective articles. The polyether polyols preferably have a number average molecular weight of from about 1,000 to about 25,000, more preferably from about 2,000 to about 20,000, and even more preferably from about 4,000 to about 18,000. The polyether polyols preferably have an end group unsaturation level of no greater than about 0.04 milliequivalents per gram of polyol. More preferably, the polyether polyol has an end group unsaturation of no greater than about 0.02 milliequivalents per gram of polyol. Examples of commercially available diols that are suitable for making the isocyanate-terminate PUR prepolymer include ARCOL R-1819 (number average molecular weight of 8,000), E-2204 (number average molecular weight of 4,000), and ARCOL E-2211 (number average molecular weight of 11,000).<br>
Any of numerous polyisocyanates, advantageously, diisocyanates, and mixtures thereof, can be used to provide the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers. In one embodiment, the polyisocyanate can be diphenylmethane diisocyanate ("MDI"), polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate ("PMDI"), paraphenylene diisocyanate, naphthylene diisocyanate, liquid carbodiimide-modified MDI and derivatives thereof, isophorone diisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate ("TDI"), particularly the 2,6- TDI isomer, as well as various other aliphatic and aromatic polyisocyanates that are well-established in the art, and combinations thereof.<br>
-6-<br><br>
Silylation reactants for reaction with the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers described above must contain functionality that is reactive with isocyanate and at least one readily hydrolyzable and subsequently crosslinkable group, e.g., alkoxy. Particularly useful silylation reactants are the aminosilanes, especially those of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl of up to 8 carbon atoms or aryl of up to 8 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkylene group of up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, each R3 is the same or different alkyl or aryl group of up to 8 carbon atoms, each R4 is the same or different alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and x is 0, 1 or 2. In one embodiment, R1 is hydrogen or a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl or phenyl group, R2 possesses 1 to 4 carbon atoms, each R4 is the same or different methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl group and x is 0.<br>
Specific aminosilanes for use herein include aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aminobutyltriethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane, and aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, for example. Other suitable aminosilanes include, but are not limited to phenylaminopropyltriemthoxy silane, methylaminopropyltriemthoxysilane, n-butylaminopropyltrimethoxy silane, t-butyl aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, cyclohexylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, dibutylmaleate aminopropyltriemthoxysilane, dibutylmaleate-substituted 4-arnino-3,3 -dimethylbutyl trimethoxy silane, N -methyl- 3 -amino- 2-<br>

-7-<br><br>
methylpropyltriemthoxysilane,3-(N-methyl-3-amino-l-methyl-l-ethoxy)propyItrimethoxysilane, N-ethyl-4-amino-3,3-dimethylbutyidimethoxymethylsilane and N-ethyl; 4-amino-3,3-dimethylbutyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
A catalyst will ordinarily be used in the preparation of the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers. Advantageously, condensation catalysts are employed since these will also catalyze the cure (hydrolysis followed by crosslinking) of the SPUR resin component of the curable compositions of the invention. Suitable condensation catalysts include the dialkyltin dicarboxylates such as dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin acetate, tertiary amines, the stannous salts of carboxylic acids, such as stannous octoate and stannous acetate, and the like. In one embodiment of the present invention, dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst is used in the production of the PUR prepolymer, Other useful catalysts include zirconium complex (KAT XC6212, K-KAT XC-A209 available from King Industries, Inc., aluminum chelate (TYZER® types available from DuPont company, and KR types available from Kenrich Petrochemical, Inc., and other organic metal, such as Zn, Co, Ni, and Fe, and the like.<br>
(b)       Moisture-curable SPUR Resins Obtained From Hydroxyl-terminated PUR Preolymers<br>
The moisture-curable SPUR resin can, as previously indicated, be prepared by reacting a hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer with an isocyanatosilane. The hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer can be obtained in substantially the same maimer employing substantially the same materials, i.e., polyols, polyisocyanates and optional catalysts (preferably condensation catalysts), described above for the preparation of isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolynmers the one major difference being that the proportions of polyol and polyisocyanate will be such as to result in hydroxyl-terminationin the resulting prepolymer. Thus, e.g., in the case of a diol and a diisocyanate, a molar excess of the former will be used thereby resulting in hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer.<br>
-8-<br><br>
Useful silylation reactants for the hydroxyl-terminated SPUR resins are those, containing isocyanate termination and readily hydrolizable functionality, e.g., 1 to 3 alkoxy groups. Suitable silylating reactants are the isocyanatosilanes of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R5 is an alkylene group of up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, each R6 is the same or different alkyl or aryl group of up to 8 carbon atoms, each R7 is the same or different alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and y is 0,1 or 2. In one embodiment, R5 possesses 1 to 4 carbon atoms, each R7 is the same or different methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl group and y is 0.<br>
Specific isocyanatosilanes that can be used herein to react with the foregoing hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymers to provide moisture-curable SPUR resins include isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane, isocyanatoisopropyl trimethoxysilane, isocyanato-n-butyltrimethoxysilane, isocyanato-t-butyltrimethoxysilane, isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, isocyanatoisopropyltriethoxysilane, isocynato-n-butyltriethoxysilane, isocyanato-t-butyltriethoxysilane, and the like.<br>
(c)       Moisture-curable SPUR Resins Obtained From Reacting Isocyanatosilane directly with a Polyol<br>
The moisture-curable SPUR resins of the present invention can be obtained from one or more polyols, advantageously, diols, reacting directly with isocyanatosilane without the initial formation of a polyurethane prepolymer. The materials, i.e., polyols and silanes (e.g., one possessing both hydrolysable and isocyanato functionality, useful for this approach to producing moisture-curable SPUR resin are described above. As such, suitable polyols include, hydroxy-terminated polyols having a molecular weight between about 4000 to 20,000. However, mixtures of<br>
-9-<br><br>
polyols of various structures, molecular weights and/or functionalities can also be used. Suitable isocyanatosilanes used to react with the foregoing polyols to provide moisture-curable SPUR resins are described above.<br>
The urethane prepolymer synthesis and subsequent silylation reaction, as well as the direct reaction of polyol and isocyanatosilane are conducted under anhydrous conditions and preferably under an inert atmosphere, such as a blanket of nitrogen, to prevent premature hydrolysis of the alkoxysilane groups. Typical temperature range for both reaction steps, is 0° to 150°C, and more preferably between 60° and 90°C. Typically, the total reaction time for the synthesis of the silylated polyurethane is between 4 to 8 hours.<br>
The synthesis is monitored using a standard titration technique (ASTM 2572-87) or infrared analysis. Silylation of the urethane prepolymers is considered complete when no residual -NCO can be detected by either technique.<br>
The curable composition of the present invention includes at least one organic nanoclay filler (b). Nanoclays possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. The nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
When describing the organic nanoclay filler of the present invention, the following terms have the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The term "exfoliation" as used herein describes a process wherein packets of nanoclay platelets separate from one another in a polymer matrix. During exfoliation, platelets at the outermost region of each packet cleave off, exposing more platelets for separation.<br>
-10-<br><br>
The term "gallery" as used herein describes the space between parallel layers of clay platelets. The gallery spacing changes depending on the nature of the molecule or polymer occupying the space. An interlayer space between individual nanoclay platelets varies, again depending on the type of molecules that occupy the space.<br>
The term "intercalant" as used herein includes any inorganic or organic compound capable of entering the clay gallery and bonding to the surface.<br>
The term "intercalate" as used herein designates a clay-chemical complex wherein the clay gallery spacing has increased due to the process of surface modification. Under the proper conditions of temperature and shear, an intercalate is capable of exfoliating in a resin matrix.<br>
The expression "modified clay" as used herein designates a clay material that has been treated with any inorganic or organic compound that is capable of undergoing-ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>
The term "nanoclay" as used herein describes clay materials that possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. Nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
The expression "organic nanoclay" as use herein describes a nanoclay that has been treated or modified with an organic intercalant.<br>
The term "organoclay" as used herein designates a clay or other layered material that has been treated with organic molecules (variously referred to as "exfoliating agents/1 "surface modifiers" or "mtercalants") that are capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The nanoclays can be natural or synthetic materials. This distinction can influence the particle size and for this invention, the particles should have a lateral dimension of between about 0.01 µm and about 5 µm, and preferably between about 0.05 µm and about 2 µm, and more preferably between about 0.1 urn and about 1 urn.

In another embodiment, useful layered materials include micaceous minerals such as illite and mixed layered illite/smectite minerals such as recto rite, tarosovite, ledikite and admixtures of illites with one or more of the clay minerals named above. Any swellable layered material that sufficiently sorbs the organic molecules to increase the interlayer spacing between adjacent phyllosilicate platelets to at least about 5 angstroms, or to at least about 10 angstroms, (when the phyllosilicate is measured dry) can be used to provide the curable compositions of the invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, organic and inorganic compounds useful for treating or modifying the clays and layered materials include cationic surfactants such as ammonium, ammonium chloride, alkyl ammonium (primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines or sulfides.<br>
