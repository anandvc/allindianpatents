Title of the invention -  MULTI-BREAK CONTACT SYSTEM<br>
FOR CIRCUIT BREAKER<br>

(a)	NAME :	LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO LIMITED<br>

(c)	ADDRESS : L&amp;T House, Ballard Estate, Mumbai 400 001,<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electrical circuit breaker provided with multibreak contact system. More particularly, the invention relates to a multibreak contact system comprising quadra-break contacts in a circuit breaker so as to enable four arcs to be connected in series thereby causing enhancement in the rate of rise of arc voltage thus favouring a very high breaking capacity.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Among technical solutions, that are currently most widely used, there are two that are often used in combination.<br>
In particular, a first solution forces the current to follow a given path, so that when short circuit occurs, electrodynamic repulsion forces occur between the contacts. These repulsion forces generate a useful thrust that helps to increase the separation speed of moving contacts with respect to the fixed contacts; in this manner, the intervention time is reduced and the presumed short-circuit current is prevented from reaching its maximum peak value.<br>
The second solution doubles the fixed contacts and the moving contacts. In this case, the flow of current is interrupted in each pole of circuit breaker in two separate regions that are arranged electrically in series to each other, so that each region is subjected to lower mechanical and thermal stresses.<br>
2<br>
 <br>
US4910485 describes a breaking device for a low voltage molded case multipole circuit breaker, comprising a rotary switching bar. But no such compact arrangement is described which provides enhanced rate of rise of arc voltage thus favouring a very high breaking capacity.<br>
A particular critical aspect of known types of circuit breaker is the fact that the presence of electrodynamic repulsion forces, while contributing positively to the generation of the thrust useful for contact separation on one hand, on the other hand helps the moving contact structure to reach the end of its stroke at high speed and therefore with great energy. This tends to cause violent impacts against the case of circuit breaker, with the possibility of damaging it, and can therefore require the use of additional cushioning elements; moreover, bouncing of the moving contacts toward the fixed contacts and undesirable re-striking of the electric arc can occur. In the case of circuit breakers with double contacts, the likelihood of bouncing and re-striking of the electric arc can be increased by the presence of additional springs, which are usually associated with the structure of each moving contact in order to facilitate an even distribution of the mechanical pressure on the two surfaces for coupling between each moving contact the corresponding fixed contacts.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a multibreak contact system with high breaking capacity that eliminates the drawbacks noted above and in particular in which opening in the short circuit condition having four series<br>
3<br>
 <br>
arcs due to multi/quadra break type of construction results into less let through energy i.e. very low mechanical and thermal stresses on the structure.<br>
The present inventors has found that enhancement in the rate of rise of arc voltage thus ensuring high breaking capacity in the contacts of a multibreak contact system can be achieved by way of an unique construction which leads to the compactness of the whole system.<br>
