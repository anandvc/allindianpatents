Reaction of the compound of XII with an acid halide of the formula R1BCOCI or an acid anhydride of the formula (R18CO)20, where R18 is H or (d-C^alkyl, with or without a reaction inert solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, preferably methylene chloride, in the presence of Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride, at a temperature from about 0CC to about 100°C, followed by nitrogen deprotection, yields the compound of formula (IL). The reaction with the acid halide or anhydride can be carried out using other known Lewis acids or other Friedel-Crafts acylation methods that are known in the art.<br>
The reactions described herein in which -N02, -S02NR7RB, -COR18, I, Br or CI are introduced on the compound of formula (XII), as depicted in Scheme 11 and described above, can be performed on any analogous compound wherein R2 is hydrogen, (CrC6)alkyl, halo, (CrC6)alkoxy or -NHCONR7R8, producing compounds of the formula (II) wherein Rz and R3 are defined as in the definition of compounds of the formula (II) above.<br>
Compounds that are identical to those of the formula (IL), but which retain the nitrogen protecting group, can be converted into the corresponding O-acyl substituted compounds, Le., those wherein the -C(=0)R1e group of formula (IL) is replaced with a -O-C(=0)R18 group, using Baeyer-Villiger processes well known to those skilled in the art. The resulting compounds can be partially hydrolyzed to yield the corresponding hydroxy substituted compounds, and then alkylated to form the corresponding alkoxy-substituted compounds. Also, such O-acyl substituted compounds can be used to prepare variably substituted benzisoxazoles.<br>
. Scheme 12 illustrates methods of making compounds of the formula (II) wherein: (a) R1 is hydrogen and R2 is chloro; (b) R1 is hydrogen and the benzo ring is substituted with cyano; (c) R? is hydrogen and the benzo ring is substituted with amino; and (d) R* is hydrogen and the benzo ring is substituted with R18C(=0)N(H)-. These compounds are referred to in Scheme 12, respectively, as compounds of the formulae (lM), (IN), (IP) and (IQ).<br><br>
Compounds of formula (IM) can be prepared from compounds of the formula (XXV) by generation of a dia2onium salt with, for instance, an alkali metal nitrite and strong mineral acid (ej^, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid) in water, followed by reaction with a copper halide salt, such as copper (II) chloride. Nitrogen deprqtection by the methods described above yields the desired compound of formula (IM). Alternative methods for the generation of diazonium salts, as known and practiced by those of skill in the art, can also be used. The foregoing reaction is generally carried out by temperatures ranging from about 0°C to about 60CC, preferably about 60°C for about 15 minutes to one hour.<br>
Reaction of the diazodium salt, prepared as described above, with potassium iodide in an aqueous medium provides the analogous iodide derivative. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature from about 0°C to about room temperature, preferably at about room temperature. The resulting compound, or its analogous N-tert-butylcarbonate protected form, can be used to prepare the corresponding cyano derivative by reaction with copper (II) cyanide and sodium cyanide in DMF, N,N-dimethylpropylurea (DMPU) or DMSO, preferably DMF, at a temperature from about 50°C to about 180°C, preferably about 150°C. Nitrogen deprotection as described above provides the desired compound of formula (IM).<br>
The above described iodide derivative can also be used to access a variety of other substituents such as aryl, acetylene and vinyl substituents, as well as the corresponding carbonyl esters and amides, by palladium and nickel catalyzed processes known to those of skill in the art, such as Heck, Suzuki and Stille couplings and Heck carbonylations. These compounds and others, wherein R2 is halo, alkyl, alkoxy, etc., may be similarly functionalized to generate compounds wherein R2 and R3 are as defined above.<br>
Nitrogen deprotection of the compound of formula (XXV) provides the compound of<br>
the formula (IP).  The compound of formula (XXV) can be reacted with a acyl group having<br>
the formula R18COCI or (Rt8CO)20 using the methods described above, followed by nitrogen<br>
deprotection to provide compounds of the formula (IQ).  In a similar fashion, treatment of the<br>
protected amine with a compound having the formula R1fiS02X"", when X"" is chloro or<br>
bromo, followed by nitrogen deprotection, provides the corresponding sulfonamide derivative.<br>
As noted above, suitable amine protecting groups that can be used, alternatively, in<br>
the   procedures    described    throughout    this    document   include    -COCF3,    -COCCI3)<br>
-COOCH2CCI3, -COO(CrC6)alkyl and -COOCH2C6H5.   These groups may be removed by<br>
methods described for each in Greene et al.'s Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry,<br>
referred to above.  Instances where protecting groups would be modified under the reaction<br>
conditions, such as, e.g., a -COOCH2C6H5 group during nitration, still permit said procedures<br>
to operate as described with said modified protecting group. Modifying the order of protecting<br>
group incorporation and/or methods of functional group introduction or modification may also<br>
be applied where appropriate.<br><br>
In each of the reactions discussed above, or illustrated in Schemes 5-12, above, pressure is not critical unless otherwise indicated. Pressures from about 0.5 atmospheres to about 5 atmospheres are generally acceptable, with ambient pressure, Ke., about 1 atmosphere, being preferred as a matter of convenience.<br>
Biological Assay The effectiveness of the active compounds made by the processes of the present invention in suppressing nicotine binding to specific receptor sites is determined by the following procedure which is a modification of the methods of Lippiello, P. M. and Fernandes, K. G. (in The Binding of L-^HjNicotine To A Single Class of High-Affinity Sites in Rat Brain Membranes, Molecular Pharm., 29, 448-54, (1986)) and Anderson, D. J. and Arneric, 5. P. (in Nicotinic Receptor Binding of 3H-Cystisine, 3H-Nicotine and 3H-Methylcarmbamylcholine In Rat Brain, European J. Pharm., 253, 261-67 (1994)).<br>
The compounds of the formula (II) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts (hereafter "the active compounds") prepared by the methods of the invention can be administered via either the oral, transdermal (e.g., through the use of a patch), intranasal, sublingual, rectal, parenteral or topical routes. Transdermal and oral administration are preferred. These compounds are, most desirably, administered in dosages ranging from about 0.01 mg up to about 1500 mg per day, preferably from about 0.1 to about 300 mg per day in single or divided doses, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of about 0.001 mg to about 10 mg per kg of body weight per day is most desirably employed. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the weight and condition of the persons being treated and their individual responses to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval during which such administration is carried out. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
The active compounds prepared by the methods of the invention can be administered aione or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable earners or diluents by any of the several routes previously indicated. More particularly, the active compounds can be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, e.g., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, transdermal patches, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents.    In addition, ora\ pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened<br><br>
and/or flavored.    In general, the active compounds are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br>
For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (preferably com, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc can be used for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.<br>
For parenteral administration, a solution of an active compound in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8), if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
It is also possible to administer the active compounds prepared by the methods of the invention topically and this can be done by way of creams, a patch, jellies, gels, pastes, ointments and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The preparation of other compounds of the present invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Intermediate compounds of invention referred to above may contain chiral centers, and therefore may exist in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms; this invention is directed to all such optical and stereoisomers of said intermediate compounds, as well as mixtures thereof.<br><br>
