ABSTRACT 87/CHENP/2005 &quot;Molded parts with discontinuous fabric surface areas and processes for their production&quot; The present invention thus provides a fabric-laminated plastic part and a novel process where the fabric edges are covered with a second plastic component that adheres both to the fabric and to the first plastic material. A first plastic substrate component is prepared with an adhered fabric surface areas and then the edges of the fabrics are overlapped by a second molded-on, plastic edge-covering component. The second material covers the fabrics edge to provide an aesthetically pleasing surface. This construction produces a more durable fabrics edge covering and eliminates the tendency of the fabric to peel off the molded part during use.</td>

MOLDED PARTS WITH DISCONT^UOUS FABRIC SURFACE AREAS AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PRODUCTION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE STATENfENT<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. National Application No. 10/208,394, filed<br>
July 29, 2003.<br>
This invenfion relates to injection molded plastic parts having fabric surface areas in or around areas where there are discontinuities (for example, voids, openings contours and the like) at the surface of the part. The molded plastic enclosures of many types of articles need to have openings, gripping surfaces and similar sorts of discontinuotis surface areas for purposes of key pads, buttons, switches, displays, aesthetics, etc. This invention provides such parts with an attractive and sturdy fabric surface and a process for making these parts ivhere the fabric edges are precisely located and secured in a very effective and aesthetically ileasing manner. Parts are produced v/ith good appearance, precise dimensions, thin part TOSS section and stable, secure fabric edge coverings.<br>
JACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIQN<br>
'here ave a number of processes for providing a surface layer of a fabric, such as leather or<br>
hnnlaled leather, onto all or part of the surface of molded plastic parts. Using an injection<br>
lolding process and prc-inserting a fabric surface piece in front of or into the mold is<br>
iscussed in JP 54-018,039; JP 57-029,436; DE 4,015,071; EP 1,157,799; and US Patenr<br>
0.4,849,145.<br>
E 4,015,071 and JP 57-029,436 teach the use of a fihn layer between the fabric and the jected, molten plastic. In EP 1,157,799 a thennoformable plastic film is pre-Iaminated to e fabric and then a shaped preform is prepared by fontiing the lanunated material, for example by a deep drawing process, to correspond generally to the finished part surface isign. Then the preform is inserted into the injection mold where the molten plastic is jected behind the fabric/foil laminate pre-form to form a part having all or part of the sign layer as the outer surface of the finished pan.<br><br>
-.V..... -1, uuiic 01 me pnor art references teach an efficient and effective techniqwa for preparing thin-wall, motded articles that have precisely located fabric surfaces with smooth fabric surface areas that are intended to have discontinuities, voids or openings (that is, nonlinear fabric edges) corresponding to discontinuities, voids or openings in the underlying    . molded plastic article. Instead, the fabric surface areas resulting from these methods tend to be wrinkled and/or require subsequent process steps to provide the voids or openings in the fabric and/or the underlying plastic article. In addition, none of the prior art references teach a method for precisely locating fabric in a finished molded article as to eliminate the need for secondaiy operations. The problems with the fabric surfaces are especially pronounced in low modulus, elastic fabrics that are more easily stretched or compressed in molding step(s).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment the present invention is a process for preparing a molded plastic article comprising a substrate plastic component with dscontinuities or voids and a fabric surface area with discontinuities or voids corresponding and aligned to those m the substrate plastic component comprising the steps of: (a) laminating to the back side of a fabric a support layer, (b) cutting or shaping the laminated fabric to generally conform to the shape and size of a desired fabric surface area and mcorporating discontinuities or voids to correspond to those in the plastic substrate component, (c) inserting the shaped laminated fabric piece from step (b) into a molding cavity with the discontinuities and/or voids properly aligned with the mold surface and holding the piece in place, and (d) molding the plastic substrate component in the molding cavity, and (e) removing the molded plastic article from the mold. Preferably the support layer is laminated to the fabric using an intermediate adhesive polymer which is preferably an EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) polymer adhesive. In other preferred embodiments, Ae support layer coniprises polycaibonate and/or there is a foamed plastic layer between the fabric piece and the support layer and/or flie fabric is a synthetic leather or suede. In an alternative embodiment, the present invention is also a molded article prepared according to the previous process embodiments.<br>
The present invention thus provides a better fabric-laminated plastic part and a novel process and part design where a high quality, precisely located, smooth fabric surface is<br><br>
_ — .„uL u.,u ciiiviciii. process. The fabric can be selected from a wide range of fabric types and laminated to the support layer. The fabric laminate is then precut, stamped and/or otherwise shaped to desired size. The laminated fabric piece is inserted into a mold cavity by hand or any generally known mechanical/robotic means and is adhered to plastic substrate component that is injected into the mold cavity to provide a fabric-laminated piece for further process steps or assembly to a finished product with an aesthetically pleasing and durable fabric covering. Proper selection of the combination of the support layer material, the plastic substrate material and the fabric provides the necessaty processability and rigidity to prevetit the fabric material from damage or distortion during the molding process and sufficient adhesion to resist delaminating or peeling off the molded part durmg use.<br>

ETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
hs Fig. 1 perspective view and Fig. 2 cross sectional view (not to scale)of a sample part cording to the invention (I) show the fabric surface piece (10) and the thin support layer 1) that was pre-laminated to the fabric. The fabric surface area has peripheral fabric edges 3) at the outer edges of the fabric surface piece and interior fabric edges (14) where there : voids in the fabric surface piece that correspond with voids (91) at corresponding -.ations in the plastic part, Also shown m. Figs. I and 2 is the substrate component (20), in s case extending beyond and not entirely covered by the fabric piece. There are voids or ;nings of various shapes and sizes (91) in the plastic part and the fabric and a continuous or irregular peripheral fabric edge section (13 A). Both of these cases require efiil, proper location and fixing of tlie fabric piece in the mold cavity and are liighly ject to fabric surface defects due to flow forces oa these fabric edge areas.<br><br>
Fabric Surface Material<br>
A wide range of fabric materials can be used for the fabric surface aiea of this invention. This is a tremendous advantage of the parts and process tiiat are provided according to the present invention. The suitable fabric materials include but are not limited to: natural and synthetic leathers (including both leathers and suedes) and any types of textiles or textilelike materials such as, woven, non-woven, and knit fabrics from natural or synthetic fibers/materials including coagulated polyurethane laminates, PVC and other flexible fihn or sheet materials. The suitable '^fabrics" may include laminates and structures combining two or more of these and the use of one or more of these with an adhered "backing material". Though the subsequent lamination of the support layer usually makes them unnecessary, "backing materials" may be present in commercially available fabrics or added to the fabric if needed to adhere better to the support layer, stiffen the fabric and/or prevent the p]astic from being excessively forced into or through the back of the fabric. Backing materials can include a wide range of natural or synthetic materials or textiles including woven, non-woven, and knit fabrics from natural or synthetic fibers/materials, and foams, films or sheets of a plastic material.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a foam layer can advantageously be included as i backing material for the fabric piece or an intermediate Jayer between the fabric surface )iece and the support layer. When using a compressible type of foam, this can provide or enhance the soft or cushioned feel of the fabric surface. This layer can be present on the abric that is supplied for use or can be laminated to a fabric either during flie lamination of ie support layer or prior to the support layer lamination. In general, the foam can be open r closed cell and needs to be sufficiently beat resistant to retain its desired properties during le subsequent processing steps, for example not melting or coUapsmg to an unacceptable igree. Suitable foam densities are m the range of from about 5 to about 95 kilograms per ibic meter (kg/m"*), preferably from about 20 to about 75 kg/m"*, depending upon their yet thickness and degree of cushion or compression that is desired. The plastic material ed in the foam can be a thermoset or thermoplastic and preferred foam plastic layers :lude a foamed thermoset polyurethane.<br><br>
	.w uut munc can oe acmeved by flame lamination, adhesive<br>
bonding, electromagnetic radiation bonding, or thecmally initiated adhesive such as Dow Adhesive FiJm.<br>
Support Layer<br>
In the first step of fee process according to the present invention, the selected fabric is then laminated on the back side surface (that is, the side opposite to the one desired for the surface of the finished part) with a support layer. As mentioned above, an intermediate foam layer can also be applied depending upaa tlie look and feel desired for the part. In general, the support layer is desirably a thin sheet, film or layer of a plastic materia] having sufficient heat resistance and/or thickness to sufficiently resist melt softening and stretching during the molding process. The process or technique for laminatmg Qie thin sheet or layer is not critical as long as it provides a generally continuous layer on the fabric and does not ietrimentally affect the fabric or its front side surface to a degree that it is unusable or mdesirable for the surface of the finished article. Bonding of the support layer to the fabric or, where used, the fabric backing or foam layer) can be achieved, for example, by flame imination, adhesive bonding, electromagnetic radiation bonding, or thermally initiated dhesives such as films or layers of ethylene vinyl acetate, low temperature thennoplastic olyuretbane, polyethylene, polypropylene, copolyester, copolyamide, ethylene acrylic acid, id including blends or laminates of two or more of these materials.<br>
general, the material for the thin support layer, the lamination process and the lamination hesives (if necessary) bonded to the fabric are selected to obtain sufficient adhesion mbinations with the fabric and the plastic substrate material. Additionally, the support 'er of plastic material, is selected to provide sufficient rigidity dtmng the molding process minimize the fabric wrinkling and, more importently, the fabric stretch during molding. Is typically means that during the molding process, the full thickness of the support layer lot heat softened and maintains a sufficient degree of rigidity to preclude fabric wrinkling 1 stretching. In general, the full thickness of the support layer should not exceed the Tg iss transition temperature) for amorphous thermoplastic plastic material or the Tm 'stalline melting point) for semi-crystalline plastic materials during the molding process, ficient adhesion between fabric and the suDDort lav?r mat..-;-! :■• needed to avoid<br><br>
-delamination during the subsequent processing and handling to cut and mold the fabric piece. The adhesion in the molded part between tbe fabric, support layer of plastic material and plastic substrate material is critical to maintain a finished part where the fabric cannot be separated during subsequent assembly of a finished product employing the fabric-surface molded structure or during the use of the finished product.<br>
Suitable materials for the support layer of plastic material obviously depend upon the plastic substrate material that is used and include, for example thermoset plastics such as polyurethane, epoxy or thermosetting silicone and thermoplastics based on or comprising polymers such as polycarbonates ("PC"), ABS, polypropylene ("PP"), high impact polystyrene ("HIPS"), polyethylene {"PE"), polyester (for example, PET), polyacetyl, thennoplastic elastomers, Uiermoplastic polyurethanes ("TPU"), nylon, ionomer (for example, Suriyn), polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") and includmg blends of two or more of these themioplastics such as PC and ABS or such as PC, ABS and TPU.<br>
Desirably, the support layer plastic material is at least as heat resistant as, and is preferably more heat resistant than, the substrate component plastic material. In amorphous diermoplastics, this means having a Tg that is equal to or preferably higher, while in crystalline or semicrystalline thermoplastics, this means having a melting point or crystalline melting point that is equal to or preferably higher.<br>
The selection of the support layer material and the molding/processing temperature for preparing the plastic substrate will determine how thick the support layer needs to maintain sufficient rigidity of the laminated fabric piece during molding. In general the support layer hickness should be in the range of from about 0.0005 inches to about 0.05 inches (0.013 to ..3inillimetersorram), preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.01 inches (0.025 to 0.25 mv), more preferably from about Q.003 to about 0.007 inches (0.Q76 to 0.17S mm). For xample, for a PC support layer and a PC/ABS substrate component, the support layer lickness should be in the range of from about 0.001 inches to about 0.01 inches (0.025 to .25 mm). For a PET support layer, camponem , Ae support layer thickness should be in le range of from about 0,001 inches to about 0,01 inches (0.025 to 0.25 mm).<br><br>
As needed for facilitating fabrication of the part and providing the desired dimensions, shapes, irreguiarities, voids, openings, and the like, the fabric surface piece (pre-laminated with the support layer) can then be cut or shaped as needed. This means that such fabric piece can be cut, stamped out, shaped, formed and/or preformed by known techniques such the known deep drawmg processes for preparing pre-formed shapes to be inserted into the mold. Depending upon the design of the finished article, there can obviously be different fabric types used in different surface sections of the article.<br>
Plastic Substrate Component<br>
In general, the substrate component can be prepared from a broad range of plastic materials including thermoset plastics such as polyurethane, epoxy or thermosetting silicone and thermoplastics such as polycarbonates ("PC"), ABS, polypropylene ("PP"), high impact polystyrene ("HIPS"), polyethylene ("PE"), polyester, polyacetyl, thermoplastic elastomers, thermoplastic pol3mrethanes ("TPU"), nylon, iouomer (for example, Surlyn), polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") and including blends of two or more of these thermoplastics such as PC and ABS. These materials may contain pigments, additives and/or fillers that contribute any needed cost and/or performance features such as surface appearance, ignition resistance, modulus, toughness, EMT shielding and the like. It should also be noted that depending upon selection of the substrate and support layer of plastic material and the thickness of the support layer material, there may or may not be a detectable layer of boundary between the support layer material and the substrate component plastic material layer.<br>
The plastic substrate component can be prepared by generally known molding techniques hat are suited to provide the necessary plastic substrate or base part having the fabric lurface piece properly located and sufficiently adhered. A preferred molding technique is ojection molding by preparing pre-cut fabric piece that can be properly located and ufficientiy fixed to an inner mold surface in an injection molding mold during the injection lolding process. In the injection molding step molten plastic is injected into the mold, i.lling the mold, conforming the laminated fabric piece to the mold shape and multaneousiy bondmg the laminated fabric piece ro the substrate component. Other litable processes for forming the substrate and/or attaching the fabric include lermoforming, injection compression molding, gas assist injection molding, structural<br><br>
foam injeclion molding, microcellular foam molding technology, laminar injection molding, water injection molding, external gas molding, shear controlled orientation molding, and gas counter pressure injection molding.<br>
Thermosetting or thennosecable plastics can also be employed to similarly prepare the plastic substrate component using knovm techniques for reaction injection molding or resin transfer molding.<br>
In injection molding the plasric substrate molding step according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there are at least two mold parts. The fust mold part can be refened to as a "core" and the second as a "cavity". The cut out and/or shaped fabric surface piece 10 is placed in the mold, usually the cavity section, and is generally held by vacuum against the inside surface of the cavity. Then the plastic component material 20 is injected. (See Fig. 1.} The fabric piece is placed into the mold by hand, robotic or other known means that is capable of accurately locating and aligning the void area edges and the irregular edges to correspond with their desired location oa the surface of the molded article. The fabric piece is obviously placed into the mold such that the side of the fabric desired on the molded article surface is against the mold cavity wall and the side with the support layer plastic material is facing the open mold cavity and the injected plastic will flow against and contact that layer .<br>
The molten plastic material for the subsh-ate component is injected into the mold through an injection gate at a rate and pressure sufficient to fill the mold, completely cover the back iide of the fabric piece, compress the fabric piece against the cavity mold surface and adhere he injected plastic to the support layer plastic material on the back side of the fabric piece.<br>
fhe moid surface of the cavity for molding the plastic substrate caa be texmred to any nown surface fraish that is desired for any lamination/adhesion to its surface in a ubsequent step or for the appearance or texture of the exposed portions of the fabric or ibstrate plastic material. Then, during the injection step the plastic enters the mold, filling le mold, conforming the fabric piece to the mold shape and imparting the mold irface/grain/texture onto the fabric and/or substrate material surface.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
A part according to the present invention as generally shown in Fig. 1 was designed and produced as follows. A non-woven polyester fabric was laminated to a polycarbonate film 0.005 inches (approx. 0.13 mm) thick by the use of a thermally initiated ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) adhesive film commercially available from The Dow Chemical Company as Integral 801 brand film. The lamination was conducted at 220 degrees C (set-point temperature for heating the rolls) on a two-roll laminator. The resulting laminate was pre-cut to the desired size and shape (including internal openings) and inserted into the desired location between the cavity and the core on an injection mold. Placement requited careful alignment such that the fabric openings and their edges aligned ■with the mold surfaces where there would be openings and peripheral fabric edges aligned with their desired locations. The desired fabric front surface is placed against the cavity and held in place by the use of vacuum. The plastic substrate material, a PC/ABS blend, is injected into the mold coming in contactwith the PC film. The flow of the injected PC/ABS provides pressure and heat to the back side of the laminated fabric, sufficient to form the fabric to the shape of the cavity surface. Upon removal of the part from the mold and its evaluation, it can be seen that the fabric surface is properly located at all edge areas, tightly and securely adhered to the PC/ABS tliermoplastic substrate and has not been distorted, wrinkled or otherwise damaged as the plastic substrate material was injected and filled the moid.<br>
In comparison, the use of the same fabric without pre-lamination of the PC film results in the pre-cut fabric significantly stretching, winkiing and shifting within the mold during the filling and packing stage of molding. The fabric surface in the cooled and ejected plastic part has dimensions that are significantly different than the desired dimensions and substantially different than those of the pre-cut fabric.<br><br><br>
