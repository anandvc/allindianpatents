				<td>Description<br>
Method for producing a continuous steam generator and a continuous steam generator.<br>
Reference may be made to US 6321691, which discloses an attachment for welding to<br>
one of a superheater and reheater boiler component composed of a first material,<br>
comprising:<br>
support means for holding one of the superheater and reheater boiler components in a<br>
position within an industrial furnace or boiler made of one of the first material and a<br>
second material having a similar coefficient of thermal expansion and chemistry as the<br>
first material, the support means being coated by a diffusion coating with a coating of one<br>
of aluminum, chromium, silicon, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Further, it also relates to a superheater or reheater boiler component for use in an<br>
industrial boiler or furnace having improved functional life and structural stability in high<br>
temperature regions, the superheater or reheater boiler component comprising:<br>
a plurality of tubes composed of a first material; and<br>
welded attachment means for supporting the plurality of tubes in a position within the<br>
industrial furnace or boiler, made of one of the first material and second material having a<br>
similar coefficient of thermal expansion and chemistry as the first material, and being<br>
coated by a diffusion coating with a coating of one of aluminum, chromium, silicon, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a continuous steam generator,<br>
having an enclosing wall formed from steam generator pipes welded together in a gas-<br>
tight fashion, said wall being prefabricated in modules in the workshop, said modules<br>
being welded together during final assembly. It also relates to a continuous steam<br>
generator that is particularly suitable for production by such a method.<br>
In a continuous steam generator a number of steam generator pipes, which together form<br>
the gas-tight enclosing wall of the combustion chamber, are heated to evaporate a fluid<br>
medium in the steam generator pipes completely in one passage. The fluid medium-<br>
generally water- is fed after evaporation to the superheater pipes connected after the<br>
steam generator pipes and superheated there. The steam generator pipes of the continuous<br>
steam generator can thereby be arranged vertically or in a spiral fashion and therefore at<br>
an angle.<br>
In contrast to a natural circulation steam generator, a continuous steam generator is not<br>
subjected to pressure limitation so that it can be designed for live steam pressures well<br>
above the critical pressure of water (pkrit= 221 bar), where it is impossible to differentiate<br>
between the water and steam phases and phase separation is therefore not possible. A<br>
high live steam pressure favors a high level of thermal efficiency and therefore lower<br>
CO2 emissions from a fossil-fuel power plant.<br>
The enclosing walls of large combustion chambers - for example for continuous steam<br>
generators with a design output of more than 100 MWel - cannot be manufactured whole<br>
in the workshop for transport reasons. In such instances final assembly is required at the<br>
actual site of deployment, during which process the parts or even modules provided to<br>
form the enclosing wall of the combustion chamber are welded together directly on site.<br>
To facilitate production, a modular structure can be provided, with which the enclosing<br>
wall is prefabricated in modules, which have to be welded together during final assembly.<br>
Such a structure however significantly restricts the selection of materials that can be used,<br>
as when using materials that are subjected to comparatively high thermal and mechanical<br>
loading, a subsequent heat treatment may be essential when welding.<br>
Subsequent heat treatment of the weld seams involves a significant technical outlay and<br>
can therefore generally only be undertaken in the workshop and not on site during final<br>
assembly. Therefore when producing enclosing walls for large combustion chambers of<br>
continuous steam generators until now only materials that did not require subsequent heat<br>
treatment of the weld seams were used.<br>
However to increase the efficiency and therefore reduce the CO2 emissions of a fossil-<br>
fuel power plant, it is desirable to design continuous steam generators for particularly<br>
high live steam pressures and temperatures. The production of such continuous steam<br>
generators requires materials which withstand loading due to high heat flow densities at<br>
high steam temperatures and therefore high material temperatures. However these are the<br>
materials that require subsequent heat treatment of the weld seams.<br>
A possible alternative to these materials would be nickel-<br>
based materials, which despite their ability to withstand a<br>
high thermal load do not require subsequent heat treatment of<br>
the weld seams, the use of which would however significantly<br>
complicate production and render it more expensive.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to specify a method<br>
of the type mentioned above for producing a continuous steam<br>
generator that can operate at high steam pressures, which is<br>
cost-effective and involves simple technology. Also a suitable<br>
continuous steam generator for production using such a method<br>
is to be specified.<br>
With regard to the method, this object is achieved according<br>
to the invention in that a number of pipe segments provided to<br>
form the steam generator pipes and made from a material of a<br>
first material category are combined into a number of modules,<br>
each module being provided with an adapter at a number of<br>
connection points provided for connection to a further module,<br>
said module being made from a material of a second material<br>
category.<br>
The invention is thereby based on the consideration that<br>
technical outlay and cost can be kept low when producing the<br>
continuous steam generator, in that the continuous steam<br>
generator is designed for the consequent processing of<br>
conventional materials rather than expensive nickel-based<br>
materials which are difficult to process. The continuous steam<br>
generator to be produced should thereby be designed in a<br>
suitable fashion for loading due to high live steam pressures<br>
and temperatures. Primary consideration is given to the fact<br>
that the essential components of the steam generator pipes<br>
forming the enclosing wall are made from a material that is<br>
suitable for this purpose.<br>
To keep production costs low still, the continuous steam<br>
generator should thereby be prefabricated to a particularly<br>
large extent in the workshop, so that in particular any<br>
subsequent heat treatment required for weld seams can take<br>
place in relatively simple conditions and with recourse to the<br>
plurality of resources available there. The prefabricated<br>
modules can therefore be formed from pipe segments of a<br>
material suitable for high live steam pressures and<br>
temperatures.<br>
To allow final assembly of the modules, which have been<br>
prefabricated in a suitable fashion, in respect of these<br>
criteria, thereby consequently avoiding the need for<br>
subsequent treatment, the modules should be provided with<br>
corresponding adapters, which allow welding during final<br>
assembly without subsequent heat treatment of the weld seams.<br>
To this end, in contrast to the pipe segments, the adapters<br>
are made from a material with correspondingly different<br>
characteristics.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are set out in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The materials for the pipe segments on the one hand and the<br>
adapters or adapter units formed therefrom on the other hand<br>
are preferably selected specifically in respect of the<br>
criterion whether subsequent heat treatment of the weld seams<br>
is required. A particularly suitable criterion for assessing<br>
whether a material requires subsequent heat treatment of the<br>
weld seams is the so-called Vickers hardness (DIN 50 133).<br>
The parts of the combustion chamber walls of the continuous<br>
steam generator subject to a high level of loading due to high<br>
heat flow densities are therefore expediently made from a<br>
material of a first material category, the Vickers hardness of<br>
which is higher than the Vickers hardness of the parts of the<br>
combustion chamber walls subject to a lower level of loading.<br>
The latter are expediently made from a material of the second<br>
material category, the Vickers hardness HV10 of the materials<br>
of the second material category thereby preferably being less<br>
than around 350 to 400.<br>
Adjacent steam generator pipes connected parallel to the flow<br>
of a fluid medium are advantageously connected together via<br>
fins, in particular to ensure a high specific heat input into<br>
the steam generator pipes. These fins are advantageously made<br>
from a material of the second material category. As has been<br>
proven, as the fins are components of the continuous steam<br>
generator through which there is no flow, they are not subject<br>
to excessive loading due to the lack of internal pressure,<br>
with the result that the material specifications relating to<br>
them are by comparison not so stringent. These less stringent<br>
material specifications are also met by materials of the<br>
second material category. Such fins also allow the individual<br>
modules to be connected without any problem in a horizontal<br>
direction during final assembly when the pipes of the<br>
continuous steam generator are vertical. To this end half-<br>
width fins are preferably welded onto the modules at the<br>
points provided for connection to other modules in the<br>
workshop and are used for connection purposes during final<br>
assembly.<br>
The individual modules are expediently connected in a vertical<br>
direction via adapter units comprising a number of adapters<br>
and if necessary additional bend couplings. An adapter made<br>
from a material of the second material category for example is<br>
thereby welded in the workshop to a,pipe segment made from a<br>
material of the first material category and the weld seam is<br>
subsequently heat-treated. During final assembly two pipe<br>
segments produced in this fashion are for example connected<br>
directly or by means of a bend coupling, which is also made<br>
from the material of the second material category. The weld<br>
seams applied during final assembly do not have to undergo<br>
subsequent heat treatment, because the material used does not<br>
require this.<br>
With regard to the continuous steam generator the said object<br>
is achieved in that at least some of the steam generator pipes<br>
respectively are formed from a number of pipe segments<br>
connected one behind the other on the fluid medium side and<br>
that pipe segments of a steam generator pipe connected one<br>
after the other in the direction of flow are each connected<br>
via an adapter unit made from a material of a second material<br>
category.<br>
The adapter unit thereby advantageously comprises a number of<br>
adapters and in some instances a bend coupling and is arranged<br>
such that a weld seam applied to connect an adapter to a<br>
further component is outside a wall surface provided by the<br>
pipe segments.<br>
Adjacent steam generator pipes are expediently connected<br>
together in a gas-tight fashion via fins, the fins also being<br>
made from a material of the second material category.<br>
The advantages achieved with the invention are in particular<br>
that by using different materials in the enclosing wall of the<br>
combustion chamber, i.e. for the pipe segments on the one hand<br>
and for the adapters and the adapter units formed therefrom on<br>
the other hand, with characteristics, which are tailored to<br>
the respective thermal loading of the steam generator pipes,<br>
the production method for continuous steam generators for high<br>
steam pressures can be kept particularly simple. The use and<br>
combination of different types of material allows this in<br>
particular in that the steam generator pipes are prefabricated<br>
in the workshop from a material of the first material<br>
category, welded to form modules, subjected to subsequent heat<br>
treatment and provided with adapters made from a material of<br>
the second material category, which does not require<br>
subsequent heat treatment, at the points provided for<br>
connection to other modules during assembly. Suitable<br>
arrangement of these adapters outside the area exposed to high<br>
heat flow densities prevents the material being subjected to<br>
excessive loading. The weld seams resulting from welding the<br>
individual modules together during assembly do not require<br>
subsequent heat treatment, as only materials of the second<br>
material category have to be welded during final assembly.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is described in more<br>
detail below with reference to a drawing, in which:<br>
FIG 1 shows a schematic illustration of a continuous steam<br>
generator with vertically arranged evaporator pipes,<br>
FIG 2 shows two pipe segments connected together by means<br>
of an adapter unit,<br>
FIG 3 shows two pipe segments connected together by means<br>
of an alternative embodiment of an adapter unit,<br>
FIG 4 shows two pipe segments connected together by means<br>
of a further alternative embodiment of an adapter unit and<br>
FIG 5 shows a cross-section through evaporator pipes<br>
connected together via fins.<br>
Identical parts are marked with the same reference characters<br>
in all the figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of a continuous steam<br>
generator 1, the vertical gas duct of which is surrounded by<br>
an enclosing wall 4 and forms a combustion chamber, with a<br>
bell-shaped base 6 at the lower end. The base 6 encloses an<br>
outlet opening 8 (not shown here) for ash.<br>
In the area A of the gas duct a number of burners 10, of which<br>
only one is shown, are attached in the enclosing wall of the<br>
combustion chamber formed from vertically arranged steam<br>
generator pipes 12. The vertically arranged steam generator<br>
pipes 12 are welded together via fins 14 to the gas-tight<br>
enclosing wall 4.<br>
During operation of the continuous steam generator 1 a body of<br>
flame 16 results in the combustion chamber during combustion<br>
of a fossil fuel. This body of flame 16 exposes the area<br>
marked A of the continuous steam generator 1 to a very high<br>
heat flow density during its operation. The body of flame 16<br>
has a temperature profile, which decreases in a vertical<br>
direction starting from the area of the burner. Below the area<br>
A is an area B that is remote from the flame and above the<br>
area A is a further area C also remote from the flame, both of<br>
which are exposed to a comparatively low level of heat due to<br>
the resulting temperature profile.<br>
The continuous steam generator 1 is designed to be suitable<br>
for operation at high live steam pressures and temperatures<br>
and therefore for a particularly high level of efficiency even<br>
with quite limited production outlay. To this end the steam<br>
generator pipes 12, in particular in the area of high heat<br>
flow densities and high material temperatures, are made from a<br>
material, which withstands loading due to high heat flow<br>
densities. To keep production outlay and cost low at the same<br>
time, the enclosing wall 4 of the combustion chamber is<br>
prefabricated in modules 17 in the workshop. During<br>
prefabrication of the modules 17 in the workshop specific use<br>
is made of the fact that a large number of resources are<br>
available there without further outlay, so that it is possible<br>
in particular to process materials that can be subjected to a<br>
high level of thermal loading despite the associated outlay in<br>
particular during the subsequent heat treatment of weld seams.<br>
To produce the modules 17 therefore finished pipe segments 18<br>
made from a material of a first material category, that can in<br>
particular be subjected to a high level of thermal loading,<br>
are welded together. The pipe segments 18 are thereby selected<br>
such that after final assembly a plurality of pipe segments 18<br>
connected one behind the other on the fluid medium side<br>
respectively form a steam generator pipe 12.<br>
To be able to avoid subsequent heat treatment during final<br>
assembly of the modules 17, said modules 17 are then provided<br>
- still in the workshop - at the connection points provided<br>
for connection to a further module 17 with an adapter 19 made<br>
from a material of a second material category. The material of<br>
the second material category is thereby selected such that it<br>
is suitable for welding without subsequent heat treatment.<br>
During attachment to the respectively assigned pipe segment 18<br>
- also still in the workshop - said weld seam is subjected to<br>
a subsequent heat treatment, in order to satisfy the<br>
requirements of the material forming the respective pipe<br>
segment 18. The materials of the second material category<br>
thereby have a lower Vickers hardness than the materials of<br>
the first material category.<br>
During final assembly on site the individual modules 17 are<br>
finally welded together at horizontal joints 20 and vertical<br>
joints 21 respectively via the adapters 19, with only<br>
components made from a material of the second material<br>
category being connected together so that no subsequent heat<br>
treatment is required.<br>
At the vertical joints 21 a connection is achieved via fins 14<br>
and at the horizontal joints 20 via adapter units 22 formed<br>
from a plurality of adapters 19 welded together.<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of the transition area<br>
at a horizontal joint 20, which is particularly suitable for<br>
use in the area A in proximity to the flame. Two steam<br>
generator pipes 12, provided for use in the area A, in which<br>
the heat flow density is particularly high, are connected<br>
there via an adapter unit 22 in the direction of flow. The<br>
adapter unit 22 thereby comprises two adapters 19 and a bend<br>
coupling 23, each made from a material of the second material<br>
category. Two connectors 24 made from a material of the first<br>
material category are provided to connect the adapters 22 to<br>
the steam generator pipes 12.<br>
A weld seam 25 between a pipe segment 18 and a connector 24 is executed in the<br>
workshop, because it requires subsequent heat treatment due to the characteristics of the<br>
material of the pipe segments 18; the same applies to a weld seam 26 between a<br>
connector 24 and an adapter 19. A weld seam 27 between an adapter 19 and a bend<br>
coupling 23 on the other hand can be executed during final assembly, as it does not<br>
require subsequent heat treatment due to the material characteristics of the adapters 19<br>
and the bend coupling 23.<br>
The fins 14 are not subjected to internal pressure from a fluid medium and can therefore<br>
be made from a material of the second material category, even if they are in the area A. A<br>
weld seam 28 between fins 14 can therefore be executed without any problem during<br>
final assembly.<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the adapter unit 22, which is also used in<br>
the area A, comprising two adapters 19 made from a material of the second material<br>
category. The pipe segments 18 are thereby bent at the points provided for welding<br>
during final assembly such that they curve out from the surface formed by the pipe<br>
segments 18 combined to form a module 17. A separate connector 24 is therefore not<br>
required with this exemplary embodiment. A weld seam 26 between a pipe segment 18<br>
and an adapter 19 is executed in the workshop, as it requires subsequent heat treatment,<br>
while a weld seam 27 between two adapters 19 can be executed during final assembly.<br>
The fins 14 can also be welded together here without any problem at a weld seam 28<br>
during final assembly, as the lack of internal pressure from a fluid medium means that<br>
they can be made from a material of the second material category, which does not require<br>
subsequent heat treatment.<br>
Figure 4 shows two pipe segments 18, which are connected<br>
together via an adapter unit 22, which can be attached in the<br>
areas B and C. The adapter unit 22 thereby comprises two<br>
adapters 19 made from a material of the second material<br>
category. The weld seams 2 6 between the pipe segments 18 and<br>
the adapters 19 are executed in the workshop, while the weld<br>
seam 27 can be executed during final assembly, as it is<br>
between two materials of the second material category, which<br>
do not require subsequent heat treatment. In this exemplary<br>
embodiment the adapter unit 22 is not configured for the<br>
adapters 19 to be welded together in a plane outside the wall<br>
surface provided by the pipe segments 18, as the heat input in<br>
the areas B and C that are remote from the flame is low and<br>
the arrangement of components made from a material of the<br>
second material category in the actual plane of the wall can<br>
therefore be permitted.<br>
Figure 5 shows a cross-section through pipe segments 18<br>
combined into a module 17, which are connected together via<br>
fins 14 and form the steam generator pipes 12. The steam<br>
generator pipes 12 are made from a material of the first<br>
material category, while in contrast the fins 14 are made from<br>
a material of the second material category. Weld seams 2 9<br>
between a steam generator pipe 12 and a fin 14 are executed in<br>
the workshop, as they require subsequent heat treatment due to<br>
the material characteristics of the steam generator pipes 12.<br>
In contrast weld seams 30, via which two modules 17 are<br>
connected together at vertical joints 21, can be executed<br>
during final assembly, as they do not require subsequent heat<br>
treatment. During final assembly two modules 17 are welded<br>
together at the vertical joints 21 via half-width fins 31.<br>

applied to connect two adapters (19) of the same adapter unit (22) together is<br>
outside a wall surface provided by the pipe segments (18).<br>
8. Continuous steam generator (1) according to one of claims 5 to 7, the<br>
combustion chamber wall of which comprises vertical piping.<br>
9. Continuous steam generator (1) according to one of claims 5 to 8, with<br>
adjacent steam generator pipes (12) being welded together in a gas-tight<br>
fashion via fins (14), the fins (14) being made from a material of a second<br>
material category<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide a suitable method for producing a continuous<br>
steam generator (1) that can operate at high steam pressures, said method being cost-<br>
effective and involving simple technology. This is achieved by a number of pipe<br>
segments (18), which are produced from a material of a first material category, are<br>
designed to form the steam generator pipes (12) and are combined into a number of<br>
modules (17). Each module (17) is equipped with a respective adapter (19) at a number of<br>
connection points that are designed to connect an additional module (17), said adapter<br>
being produced from a material of a second category.</td>
