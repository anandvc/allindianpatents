				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compositions<br>
for door gasket of a refrigerator and a method for manufacturing a door gasket of a<br>
refrigerator using the compositions and particularly, to PVC compositions for door<br>
gasket of a refrigerator and a method for manufacturing a door gasket of a<br>
refrigerator using the compositions which prohibit formation of molds or bacteria<br>
due to migration of plasticizer by adding a certain biocide to the PVC compositions.<br>
2. Description of the Background Art<br><br>
The conventional PVC compositions for door gasket of a refrigerator<br>
comprises PVC, plasticizer, heat-resistant, cold-resistant and weather-resistant<br>
stabilizers, filler and pigment. A gasket is manufactured by mixing, compounding<br>
and extruding. Since the PVC has a form of powder, a plasticizer is used to<br>
smoothen the PVC thus to facilitate the manufacturing process.<br>
However, a PVC door gasket for a refrigerant manufactured by the above-<br>
mentioned process has a migration phenomenon which causes the plasticizer to<br>
be leak off the gasket at 60 to 80°C. Also, at a high temperature higher than<br>
100 °c, more than 1 to 2% of plasticizer in a total weight of the PVC gasket comes<br>
out. Therefore, portions of contact surfaces with ABS or HIPS which are materials<br>
for inner surface of a refrigerator are easily contaminated and there is a problem<br>
that the portion is discoloured to yellow, blue dot or red color since there are<br>
sufficient spaces on the surface of the gasket where molds and bacteria can<br>
propogate.<br>
In order to prohibit propagation of bacteria, a mold preventive in which 10,<br>
10"-oxybisphenoxagene (product name of Hokustar-HP of the Gitagooga<br>
furnitures of Japan) is added is disclosed in Korean Patent laid-open No. 10-<br>
1993-023682 and Publication No. 10-1995-006264 but the effect was not<br>
sufficient.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is, an object of the present invention to provide PVC<br>
compositions for door gasket of a refrigerator and a method for manufacturing a<br>
door gasket of a refrigerator using the compositions which prohibit contamination<br>
and discoloration due to propagation of molds or bacteria on the surface of a<br>
gasket by adding a certain biocide to PVC.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>
there is provided a polyvinyl chloride composition for door gasket of a refrigerator<br>
comprising 0.01 to 1.0 parts by weight of methyl-2-benzimidazol carbamate, 2-<br>
(4-thiazolyl)-benzimidazol, a-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]- a-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1 H-<br>
1,2,4-triazol-1-ethanol and zinc bis(2-pyridylthio-1-oxide) based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of polyvinyl chloride.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, a polyvinyl chloride<br>
having a degree of polymerization of about 1300 may be used.<br>
Biocides used in the present invention prohibit contamination<br>
and discoloration by molds or bacteria occurred by migration of a<br>
plasticizer. Following biocides are used in the present<br>
invention.<br>
Methyl-2-benzimidazol carbamate (general name: carbendazim)<br>
C<br>
[T^N^&gt;—nhccoch3<br>
2-(4-triazolyl)-benzimidazol (general name: TBZ)<br>
a- [2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]- a-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-<br>
1H-l,2,4-triazol-1-ethanol (general name: tebukonazol)<br>
Zinc bis (2-pyridylthio-1 -oxide) (general name : zinc-pyrithion)<br>
As a biocide, a single chemical compound can be used and two or more<br>
kinds of biocides can be mixed to use. The biocide according to the present<br>
invention can obtain more preferable efficiency mixing two or more chemical<br>
compounds. The amount of the biocide in use is 0.01 to 1.0 parts by weight<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of PVC. If the amount of biocide is smaller than<br>
0.01 parts by weight, the effect of the biocide is not remarkable and if larger than<br>
1 parts by weight, further effect cannot be obtained.<br>
In the PVC composition in accordance with the present invention, other<br>
general additives may be added.<br>
Plasticizer may be added to make the process of extraction, compressed<br>
transformation easier by causing a plastic flow giving fluidity to PVC<br>
macromolecule and to increase flexibility by decreasing hardness of the polymer.<br>
A<br>
As a plasticizer, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dioctyl adiphate (DOA), diisodecyi<br>
phthalate (DIP) and trioctyl trimelitate (TOTM) are used and generally, 30 to 80<br>
parts by weight or preferably, 50 to 70 parts by weight of plasticizer is used based<br>
on 100 parts by weight of PVC.<br>
Also, a stabilizer may be added to stabilize the polymer to heat, oxygen<br>
and ultraviolet rays in processing progress or in use. Stabilizer includes a heat-<br>
resistant stabilizer such as barium stearate, calcium stearate and epoxyed bean<br>
oil, a cold-resistant stabilizer such as butyltin laurate complex and a weather-<br>
resistant stabilizer such as organic phosphite ester-based complex. 1 to 5 parts by<br>
weight of stabilizer is used based on 100 parts by weight of PVC.<br>
Filler may be added to improve mechanical intensity, size stability, heat<br>
transformation temperature, hardness and other physical characteristics. As a filler<br>
of the present invention, CaCO3 is preferably used and added in the amount of 5<br>
to 50 parts by weight and preferably, 10 to 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts<br>
by weight of PVC.<br>
Also, pigment may be added to obtain a favorable color and added in the<br>
amount of 0.001 to 1 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of PVC. For<br>
example, the pigment include titanium oxide, carbon black or violet.<br>
In one illustration to manufacture the PVC of the present invention,<br>
conventionally, a Henschal mixer may be used. PVC, the alternative additives and<br>
pigments as described above are added in the mixture, maintaining the<br>
temperature of the mixer in the range of 60 to 120°C, and stirred at a low speed of<br>
400rpm for 1 to 2 minutes.<br>
Plasticizer is introduced into the mixture at the temperature of 50 to 100°C<br>
and stirred at low speed or alternately at low and high speed, and preferably at low<br>
speed.<br>
Then, filler is added and formulated at the temperature of<br>
105 to 110°C. The formulation is discharged and transferred into<br>
a cooling mixer. The formulation is treated by cooling to lower<br>
than 40°C and a resultant product in the form of powder is<br>
obtained.<br>
The powder products are transferred to an extruder and<br>
extruded.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to Examples.<br>
Examples 1 to 6<br>
Temperature of an oil jacket of a 200L Henschal mixer was<br>
maintained at 80°C and PVC having 1300 of polymerization degree<br>
and the other additives were introduced into the mixer as defined<br>
in table 1. The PVC mixture was stirred at a low speed of 400 rpm<br>
for 2 min. In Table 1, BP-203S is a commercial product comprising<br>
Barium stearate (Songwon Industrial Co. Ltd. in Pusan, Korea) and<br>
BZ-108 is a commercial product comprising Calcium stearate<br>
(Songwon Industrial Co. Ltd. in Pusan, Korea), which are heat-<br>
resistant stabilizers. Then, 1 kg. of plasticizer per one minute<br>
was added through a plasticizer heat riser and stirred at a speed<br>
of 500 rpm. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) based filler is added to<br>
the above resultant mixure, formulated at 110°C. The formulation<br>
was discharged at 125°C and transferred to a cooling mixer. Then<br>
the resultant formulation was treated by cooling to lower than<br>
40°C and the product was obtained in the form of powder. The<br>
powder-type products were extruded to manufacture a gasket.<br>
The result of a characteristic measurement of the products<br>
obtained from the above Examples is described in Table 2.<br>
resistance test against bacteria : name of colon bacilli E-Coli (ATCC<br>
25922)<br>
resistance test against mold : ASRM G-21<br>
As apparent from the result of the Examples, a PVC composition of the<br>
present invention has an excellent characteristic to be used for a door gasket of a<br>
refrigerator and particularly, there is an advantage that the compositions are<br>
efficient to prohibit transformation and discoloration of the gasket by prohibiting<br>
propagation of molds and bacteria due to migration of plasticizer.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should<br>
be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims,<br>
and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds<br>
of the claims, or equivalence of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to<br>
be embraced by the appended claims.<br>
