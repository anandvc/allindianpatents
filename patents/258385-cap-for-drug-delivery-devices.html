Cap for drug delivery devices<br>
This invention relates to a cap for drug delivery devices, in particular of the injector-ype comprising a needle and a needle cover, wherein said cap is suitable as a needle safety tool, by comprising a needle cover retaining portion. In particular, the present nvention relates to such devices, which are handled by the patients themselves.<br>
Drug delivery devices, which are handled by patients themselves and allow individual dosing of the required amount of drug are well known in the art. Generally, such devices have substantially the same purpose as that of an ordinary syringe. A device of the mechanical pen-type is known, e.g., from US Patent No. 5,226,895. In such devices, usually a needle assembly comprising a double-ended needle is attached to the device at its distal end. A drug containing cartridge is mounted in a distal end portion of the housing between the needle and a piston rod driving the piston in the cartridge for dispensing the liquid, which is moved by a drive mechanism. A removable needle cover is mounted on the distal end of the needle to protect the needle from contamination and damage. Further, a removable cap is mounted at the distal end of the housing of the device. The cap is designed to cover and protect the needle and needle cover.<br>
Prior to injection the user (patient, caregiver etc.), must remove the cap from the distal end of the housing and the needle cover from the distal end of the needle. After injection, the needle cover is put back onto the needle and the cap onto the distal end of the housing.<br>
The problem to be solved by instant invention is to reduce the risk of needle related injuries to the user, which may lead to infection of the user of the above-mentioned kind of drug delivery device. In addition, the present invention serves to avoid the loss of the needle cover during drug delivery and therefore provides improved handling of the drug delivery device.<br>
The present invention provides a cap for a drug delivery device having a needle cover r»f»ininn Dortion. designed to retain a needle cover during injection and to assist in<br><br>
safely attaching/detaching the needle cover from a needle prior to/after injection. Therefore, with the cap of the present invention, a safety tool for retaining a needle cover is provided.<br>
Attaching/detaching a needle cover, e.g. in an axial direction, to/from a needle is achieved by the cap retaining the needle cover by means of the needle cover retaining portion provided on the cap to attach/detach the needle cover.<br>
