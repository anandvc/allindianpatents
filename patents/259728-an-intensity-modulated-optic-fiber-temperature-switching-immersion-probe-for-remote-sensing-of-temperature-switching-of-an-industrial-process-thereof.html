The invention is further explained in the form of the following embodiments.<br>
In the present invention a fiber optic temperature switching probe, which comprises a<br>
fiber optic Y-shaped light guide and a small cc'l containing a special chemical/which<br>
undergoes solid to liquid phase transformation at its melting point. The cell has a<br>
concave mirror on its lower side and a glass plate on the upper side. The chemical<br>
identified and experimented for this probe undergoes phase change at a temperature of<br>
78-79 °C. A small amount of the chemical is first transferred into cell and then it is<br>
evacuated and properly sealed. The cell is further bonded to a metal tube, which fits<br>
tightly on to the common end cap of the Y-guide. A metallic ring is used for coupling<br>
the cell to the metal tube. The Y-guide has two arms, termed as a source arm and the<br>
detector arm. A white light source is coupled to the source arm while the detector arm<br>
is aligned to a PIN photo-detector. The electrical signal is processed and displayed by<br>
a powermeter.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention a suitable chemical has been identified and<br>
used to realize the cell for the temperature switching probe. Depending on the<br>
identification of a suitable chemical e.g. non-corrosive, non-inflammable, switch<br>
probes for different temperatures can be realized.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, fiber optic light guides have been<br>
employed which are made of optical glass, a highly durable material being nonconductive<br>
and non-inductive in nature.<br>
The sensing signal is in the form of intensity modulated light guided by the fiber. The<br>
signal propagation is secure without any cross talk or interference problems.<br>
The optical fiber temperature switch probe comprises of an indigenously produced Y--<br>
shaped optical fiber light guide/bundle encased in a crush-resistant metallic sleeve<br>
with its ends properly terminated into metallic end caps. A few grams of the<br>
commercially available chemical in grainy form is first vacuum dried under clean<br>
conditions and then transferred into the cell made from a thin-walled glass test tube.<br>
The curved surface at the bottom of the test tube is given a reflective aluminum<br>
coating on the outside as to realize a concave mirror while the upper end is covered<br>
with a plane glass disc. Considering the image formation characteristics, the length of<br>
the cell is chosen to be twice the focal length of the concave mirror. Proper adhesive<br>
sealing is done to make the cell airtight.<br>
With the help of a metallic ring, the cell is firmly coupled onto the common end cap<br>
of the Y-guide and in this situation, the common end rests on to the top glass cover of<br>
the cell.<br>
When the probe is immersed in a liquid container at a temperature below the melting<br>
point of the chemical, there is a fixed value of the detector signal. The chemical<br>
begins to melt as the temperature reaches around 78-79°C and thus more light reaches<br>
the detector resulting in an increased output signal. This continues till the chemical<br>
has melted completely and the detector signal has attained a maximum value which<br>
takes place at about 83 °C. The probe provides typically 6 times increase in the output<br>
signal as compared to the room temperature stage. At any particular value of<br>
temperature in this range (75-85 °C) corresponding to the level of optical signal<br>
available, either an alarm signal could be generated or the process can be shut down<br>
automatically as to stop further heating of the liquid/solvent. Thus the probe can be<br>
used as a temperature switch e.g. to stop the process from further heating at any value<br>
of temperature in this range.<br>
The probe facilitates sensing of temperature through intensity modulation of light<br>
signal. This modulation process is unaffected by a hostile and electrically noisy<br>
environment whereas the prior art has to be either properly shielded for gaining this<br>
immunity or protection. This is so because optical fibers are made from dielectric<br>
materials and therefore, they are both non-inductive and non-conductive in nature<br>
thereby bringing immunity to EMI/RFI. Also the basic raw material, optical glass<br>
from which fibers are made is quite durable and effectively withstands harsh and<br>
corrosive environments encountered in various application areas.<br>
When the probe end is dipped into a liquid whose temperature is to be monitored, the<br>
optical signal reaching the detector depends on the transparency to light provided by<br>
the cell medium. As the temperature rises, the chemical starts melting beyond a point<br>
and transparency to light goes up rapidly thus increasing the detector signal. At a<br>
stage, the signal reaches its maximum value when the entire chemical has melted.<br>
This level of the signal can be used to raise an alarm or actuate a relay/switch to shut<br>
down or start a process at that maximum value of temperature thus working as a<br>
temperature switch probe.<br>
This temperature switch probe has been experimented in the laboratory by dipping it<br>
in water and other solvents such as acetone, carbon tetrachloride, transformer oil etc<br>
to monitor their temperature. The temperature of water and other liquids is recorded<br>
with a mercury thermometer. There has been consistency and repeatability in the<br>
optical output with temperature within 1°C.<br>
This probe could be beneficially used for starting/closing of a process in an industry.<br>
The process monitoring can be carried out remotely by extending the length of optical<br>
fiber arms of the bundle. It can be quite a durable and cost-effective device and the<br>
process monitoring operation can be made automatic.<br>
