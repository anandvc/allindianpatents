The first embodiment is configured as described above.  This configuration is characterized in that, in the air-cooled type four-stroke-cycle internal combustion engine, in the area between the valve chamber and the combustion chamber, the exhaust port is provided at a position spaced from the cam chain chamber, the valve positions are at offset positions set off in the left-right directions, and the front-rear direction cooling airflow passage 33 and the sidewise cooling airflow passage 34 for the running airflow which are large in cross-sectional area are provided at central upper side of the combustion chamber. [0025]<br>
Fig. 7 is a horizontal sectional view of a running airflow passage portions in a cylinder head 40 according to the second embodiment of the present invention.  In the following embodiments, the component parts having the same functions as those in the first embodiment will be<br>
denoted by the same symbols as those for the corresponding component parts in the first embodiment, and be described.  This embodiment is characterized in that the cylinder head 7 in the first embodiment is provided with a secondary air supply device (not shown), a secondary air support port 41 communicated with the secondary air supply device is bored in a side wall of the exhaust port 22, and secondary air is supplied into the exhaust port 22 to oxidize HC and CO contained in the exhaust gas, for prevention of environmental pollution. The other points than the above-mentioned of the configuration are the same as in the first embodiment. [0026]<br>
As the secondary air supply device, there is used one of the air suction system in which supply air is directly taken in from the atmosphere through a check valve by utilizing the pulsation of the exhaust gas.  In this system, air is taken in at the time when a negative pressure is fed to the position of the check valve. As the check vale, a reed valve composed of a thin steel sheet is used. The secondary air supply device is disposed in the vicinity of the exhaust port 22, so that it is brought to a high temperature.  However, the secondary air supply device and the secondary air supply<br>
port 41 are cooled by the running airflow passing through<br>
the front-rear direction cooling airflow passage 33.<br>
[0027]<br>
Fig. 8 is a horizontal -sectional view of running<br>
airflow passage portions in a cylinder head 50 according to the third embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 9 is a front view of the cylinder head 50.  In this embodiment, a duct member 51 enlarged at a front portion thereof is provided at the front opening 30 of the cylinder head 7 in the first embodiment, and is fixed to the cylinder head 7 by a bolt 52. The running airflow can be collected from a wide range by the enlarged front portion of the duct member 51, and can be made to pass into running airflow passages 33 and 34.<br>
[0028]<br>
Fig. 10*is a horizontal sectional view of running airflow passages in a cylinder head 60 for a two-cylinder internal combustion engine according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. The cylinder head 60 in this embodiment represents an example of the configuration of the running airflow passages shown in the first embodiment to a two-cylinder internal combustion engine.  The cylinder head 60 has a structure in which the cylinder head 7 according to the first<br>
embodiment and a cylinder head configured by reversing the cylinder head 7 leftside right are integrally formed to be symmetrical, with a cam chain chamber 25 as a center of symmetry.  Since the cam chain chamber 25 serving in common for the left and right cylinders is disposed at the center, the cylinder head as a whole is symmetrical on the left and right sides.  Front openings 30 are provided at two positions in the cylinder head front surface, rear openings 31 are provided at two positions in the cylinder head rear surface, and side openings 32 are provided at one position in each of the left and right surfaces of the cylinder head.  Left and right sets of cooling airflow passages 33, 34 are symmetrical with each other. [0029]<br>
Fig. 11 is a horizontal sectional view of running airflow passage portions in a cylinder head 70 according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention.  In this embodiment, the cylinder head 7 (Fig. 3) in the first embodiment is improved, and a new rear opening 72 communicated with the position 71 corresponding to the cooling airflow passage hollowed portion 35 present in the first embodiment is provided between the stud bolt insertion hole 26D and the intake port 20. This ensures<br>
that the cooling airflow passage hollowed portion 35 which might cause stagnation of the cooling airflow in the first embodiment is eliminated, and the air present at the position 71 corresponding to the cooling airflow passage hollowed portion can be made to flow out smoothly, so that it is possible to enhance the cooling effect in the vicinity of the position 71 corresponding to the hollowed portion and in the vicinity of the stud bolt insertion hole 26D and the intake port 20. [0030]<br>
The cooling airflow passage structure for a cylinder head has been described referring to various embodiments above.  In these embodiments, the following effects can be expected.<br>
(1)	In the general configuration according to the<br>
prior art, the exhaust port 22 and the cam chain chamber<br>
25 are adjacent to each other, so that air would not pass<br>
therebetween. According to the embodiments, the front-<br>
rear direction cooling airflow passage 33 for the running<br>
airflow is formed between the exhaust port 22 and the cam<br>
chain chamber 25, so that the exhaust port 22 which would<br>
be more raised in temperature than the intake port 20 can<br>
be effectively cooled from both the left and right sides.<br>
(2)	Of the four bolts inserted in the stud bolt<br>
insertion holes 26A, 26B, 26C, 26D provided at four positions per one cylinder, particularly the stud bolt inserted in the stud bolt insertion hole 26A near the exhaust port 22 at a front portion and adjacent to the cam chain chamber 25 would easily be more raised in temperature than the other stud bolts, since the exhaust port and the cam chain chamber are adjacent to each other, in the general configuration according to the prior art. In each of the embodiments of the present invention, the stud bolt in concern is effectively cooled by the running airflow passing through the front-rear direction cooling airflow passage 33 formed in the area under consideration. This ensures that the four stud bolts are equalized in temperature, so that the facial pressure distribution in a gasket between the cylinder block 6 and the cylinder head 7 can be stabilized.<br>
(3)  Since the smooth cooling airflow passages 33, 34 extending from a front portion of the cylinder head 7 to a rear portion and a side portion of the cylinder head 7 are provided in the manner of bridging over a central upper portion of the combustion chamber 11, the combustion chamber 11 can be cooled uniformly.  This makes it possible to contrive an enhancement of combustion efficiency through an increase in compression ratio,<br>
restraint of emission of unburned materials, and restraint of knocking.<br>
(4)	Since the shaft portion of the spark plug, the<br>
valve chamber bottom surface member 27, and the<br>
reinforcing member 24 are located in the cooling airflow<br>
passages 33, 34, these components are effectively cooled,<br>
and durability thereof is enhanced.  The above-mentioned<br>
effects are obtained in common in all the embodiments of<br>
the present invention.<br>
(5)	Second embodiment: The secondary air supply<br>
device and the secondary air supply port 41 disposed in<br>
the vicinity of the exhaust port 22 of the cylinder head<br>
are brought to a high temperature in the general<br>
configuration according to the prior art, but, in the<br>
cylinder head 40 according to this embodiment, they are<br>
cooled by the running airflow passing through the front-<br>
rear direction cooling airflow passage 33.<br>
(6)	Third embodiment: The duct member 51 enlarged<br>
at a front portion thereof is provided at the front<br>
opening of the cooling airflow passage according to the<br>
present invention and is fixed to the cylinder head by<br>
the bolt 52.  The running airflow can be collected from a<br>
wide range by the enlarged front portion of the duct<br>
member 51, and be made to flow into the running airflow<br>
passages 33, 34.<br>
(7)	Fourth embodiment:  It is shown that the<br>
cooling airflow passage structure according to the<br>
present invention can be applied also to a cylinder head<br>
for a two-cylinder internal combustion engine.<br>
(8)	Fifth embodiment:  The new rear opening 72<br>
communicated with the position 71 corresponding to the<br>
cooling airflow passage hollowed portion 35 present in<br>
the first embodiment is provided between the stud bolt<br>
insertion hole 26D and the intake port 20.  This makes it<br>
!. possible to eliminate the cooling airflow passage<br>
hollowed portion 35, to smoothen the flow of the cooling airflow, and to further enhance the cooling function.<br>
