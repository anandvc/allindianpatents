				<td>Field of the Invention ;<br>
 Thisinvention relates to a process for the preparation of organic phosphites, specifically hindered  phosphites.     In an  especially preferred embodiment,   this   invention   relates   to   a   process   to  prepare   (2,4,6-tri-10  tertbutylphenyl)(2-butyl-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol) phosphite. Background of the Invention<br>
Organic phosphites are used in the stabilization of a wide variety of<br>
polymeric systems.   Many different phosphites have been proposed for use<br>
either alone or in combination with other stabilizers.   Such phosphites and<br>
15   their utilities are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,371,647, 4,656,302, 4,705,879,<br>
5,126,475, 5,141,975, and 5,438,086. The importance of organic phosphites as stabilizers has lead to the development of  a  variety of specialty organic phosphites that have enhanced effectiveness for stabilization.<br>
Sterically hindered organic phosphites, and in particular phosphites<br>
20     containing   2,4,6-substituted   phenyl   groups   wherein   the   substitution   is selected from the group consisting of t-butyl, t-amyl, t-hexyl, cyclohexyl, t-. pentyl, and t-octyl, are especially desirable compounds due to their enhanced hydrolytic stability, ease of handling and compatibility with a wide variety of polymeric systems.   Mixed alkyl aryl phosphites wherein at least one of the 25    aryl group is one of the aforementioned sterically hindered phenyl groups are also especiallv preferred for their improved hydrolytic stability over other alkyl substituted phosphites as well as their enhanced compatibility with some polymeric resins, especially polyolefins.<br>
The   organic   phosphites   are   generally   prepared   using   methods<br>
30   involving   reactions   between   hydroxyl-substituted   alkyl   and   hydroxyl-<br>
-2-<br><br>
substituted aryl compounds and phosphorous trihalides, e.g., phosphorous trichloride.    Such methods are  described in  U.S.  Patent Nos. 4,237,075, 4,440,696, 4,492,661, and 5,235,086.  The ease of substitution of the halides on the phosphorous trihalide decreases as each halide is replaced.  For example,        in the preparation of neoalkyl aryl phosphites, the neoalkyl diol readily reacts in essentially quantitative conversion with a phosphorous trihalide to yield a disubstituted neoalkyl halo phosphite (i.e., an intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite).   The displacement of the third halo group is less than quantitative and is considerably slower in rate. Additionally, displacement of      the third halo group by a stencally hindered phenol is even more difficult and requires elevated temperatures and/or use of a catalyst.<br>
In order to increase the rate of reaction and the degree of completion for displacing the third halide with a sterically hindered moiety, various techniques have been utilized to remove the hydrogen halide by-product       from the reaction scheme. These techniques include: use of hydrogen halide acceptors, e.g., amines, and removal of the hydrogen halide with vacuum. Such techniques are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,281,506, 4,237,075, 4,312,818, 4,440,696, and 4,894,481.<br>
Generally the procedures of the prior art result in product conversions         of less than about 94%.   The resulting phosphite mixture containing a halo-phosphite is extremely difficult to purify and the residual halo-phosphite can lead to acid impurities that affect the long term stability of the desired organic phosphite. It is therefore apparent that a need continues to exist for improved processes for the preparation of organic phosphites, and especially sterically      hindered organic phosphites, that overcome the aforementioned difficulties. Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the production of organic phosphites from di-substituted phosphites and hvdroxyl-containing compounds, preferably  sterically hindered phenols,  in  the presence of a         polymeric amine.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process to produce organic phosphite, wherein said process comprises heating in the manner such as herein described a di-substituted phosphorohalidite, a phenolic compound, and a polymeric amine of the kind such as herein described.<br>
These and other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art with the disclosure of the present invention. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes to produce organic phosphites of the general formula (RO)3P, wherein the R groups are independently a C1-20 alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl moiety. Organic phosphites are typically produced by reacting a phosphorous trihalide, e.g. phosphorous trichloride, with hydroxyl-containing compounds wherein the halides are displaced on the phosphorous trihalide by the hydroxyl-containing compounds. The ease of substitution by the hydroxyl-containing compounds depends at least partly on the steric bulk of the hydroxyl-containing<br>
-9-<br><br>
compounds.    When the hydroxyl-containing compound has  a low steric demand (i.e. the hydroxyl-containing compound is not a sterically hindered phenol), the displacement of the halides is somewhat statistical.  However, as the steric demand of the hydroxyl-containing compound increases, increased        selectivity may be obtained to achieve less substituted halophosphites.    In displacement of the first two halides on the phosphorous  trihalide,  the reactions are generally facile and proceed to completion without the need for catalysis  regardless  of  the, steric  limitations  of  the   hydroxyl-containing compound.<br>
	In the displacement of the third halide moiety from the di-substituted<br>
phosphorus halide, the degree of conversion to the tri-substituted phosphite is adversely affected by steric considerations of both the di-substituted phosphorus halide and the hydroxyl-containing compound. Catalysts are often employed in the art to increase the degree of conversion to the tri-      substituted phosphite. It was quite surprising discovered that the use of polymeric amines in the process to displace the third halide moiety from the di-substituted phosphorus halide results in extremely high conversions to the tri-substituted phosphite.<br>
As previously discussed, the process of the present invention is useful       to produce organic phosphites of the general formula (RO)3P wherein the R groups are independently a C1-20 alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl moiety.    As the R groups become increasingly sterically hindered, the conversion from the di-substituted phosphorohalidite to the tri-substituted phosphite becomes more difficult  and   the  conversion  percentage  becomes  diminished.      General     methods to prepare organic phosphites are known in the  are and  are exemplified   by   U.S.   Patents   3,415,906;   3,488,407;   3,467,733;   4,276,233; 4,318,845; and 5,424,348.<br>
The reaction between the hydroxyl-containing compounds and phosphorus trihalide to form an intermediate di-substiruted          phosphorohalidite may be carried out with or without the use of a solvent.<br>
-10-<br><br>
Typically PCl3 is utilized although other phosphorus halides or derivatives             may be used. Generally, PCl3 is added to the hydroxyl-containing<br>
compounds or alternatively, the hydroxyl-containing compounds can be added to PCl3. Preferably the hydroxyl-containing compounds are added to        the PCl3 with the reaction mixture being maintained at a temperature of about 5° to 50°C. The reaction is quite exothermic in the absence of a solvent but a temperature moderating effect is produced by the cooling effect of vigorous HC1 evolution. Hence, by effective control of the addition of hydroxyl-containing compounds, the reaction may be made self-regulating in the        temperature range of between about 5° to 15°C A slower addition favors<br>
lower temperatures and it is preferred to cool the reaction mixture during the addition. A slight excess of stoichiometric amounts of PCl3 is commonly utilized.<br>
When a solvent is utilized, it is important that the solvent be neutral to          the reaction ingredients and by-products. Typical solvents include, for example, toluene, heptane, xylene, methylene chloride, chloroform, and benzene. Preferred solvents are methylene chloride, heptane, or xylene.<br>
After the reaction has gone to completion, the bulk of the halide byproduct, such as HCl, may optionally be removed by gently raising the         temperature of the product to room temperature to about 50°C. Any solvent utilized is generally at least partially removed, typically by application of a vacuum, to insure complete removal of the hydrogen halide by-product to yield an intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite product.<br>
The intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite product is next        allowed to react with a hydroxy-substituted compound to yield the desired trisubstituted organic phosphite. The reaction between the intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite product and the hydroxy-substituted compound may be conducted in the same reaction vessel that was employed to produce the intermediate phosphorohalidite by merely introducing the       hydroxy-substituted compound followed by the polymeric amine into the<br>
 -11-<br><br>
reactor. Alternatively, the hydroxy-substituted compound and the polymeric amine may be premixed, optionally with heating to aid in dissolution; and the intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite added to the mixture. It was unexpectedly found that when the hydroxy-substituted compound and the       polymeric amine were premixed before addition of the intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite product that less color was formed in the final phosphite product. Additionally, it was unexpectedly found that the color of the final phosphite product could be controlled by the addition rate of the intermediate di-substituted phosphorohalidite product with' a slower        addition rate leading to less color in the final phosphite product. An<br>
appropriate addition rate can be readily determined by color determination of the final product and depends also on factors such as the exact reaction  conditions, ratios of ingredients, and equipment utilized. Regardless of the order of addition, the reaction is generally carried out at a suitable         temperature between about 20° to about 175°C and preferably between about 120° to about 155°C. The pressure of the reaction system is maintained between about 50 millimeters mercury absolute to atmospheric pressure. Typical reaction times to substantial completion are from 1 to about 24 hours. Preferably, the temperature and pressure conditions are selected to afford the       maximum amount of product within a time period of about 1 to about 6 hours.<br>
The polymeric amines of the present invention are known compounds and include amines of the general formula:<br><br>
     wherein each R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7 is independently a C1-20 alkyl, C6-20 aryl, or C7-20 alkaryl moiety, and x is an integer of from 0 to about 100. In a preferred embodiment, each R1, R2, R4, R6, and R7 is independently a C1-4 alky]<br>
-12-<br><br>
moiety, each R3 and R5 is independently a C1-8 alkyl moiety, and x is an integer of from 0 to about 5.<br>
The role of the amine in the current process is believed to be two-fold depending in part on the structure of the hydroxyl-containing compound.        When  the hydroxyl-containing compound  is  a  phenolic  compound,   the polymeric amine is believed to deprotonate the phenolic compound to result in the formation of a phenoxide. The phenoxide in turn is believed to displace the halide from the phosphorous halide.  Additionally, it is believed that the polymeric amine forms an amine salt with the hydrogen halide by-product         from the phosphorous halide displacement reaction. It is further believed that when  the amine  salt has a low solubility  in the reaction medium,  the displacement reaction is driven to completion and very high conversions to the desired tri-substituted organic phosphite are achieved.<br>
Polymeric amines having relatively short chain lengths are especially<br>
       preferred in the present invention.   As the chain length become longer than<br>
about ten carbons,  the  conversion to  the  desired  tri-substituted  organic<br>
phosphite becomes diminished.   Additionally, aromatic substitution on the<br>
polymeric amine can result in an increased color in the tri-substituted organic<br>
phosphite,   although   the  conversion   to   the   desired   phosphite   is   quite<br>
       acceptable.    Thus, in an especially preferred embodiment, the polymeric<br>
amine is of the formula:<br><br>
wherein each R1, R2, R4, R6, and R7 is independently a methyl or ethyl moiety, each R3 and R5 is independently a C2-6 alkyl moiety, and x is an integer of        from 0 to about 2. The most preferred polymeric amines are wherein each R1, R2, R6, and R7 is independently a methyl or ethyl moiety, R3 is a C2-4 alkyl moiety, and x is 0. The use of polymeric amines of longer repeating units (i.e., X greater than 2) in the present invention does lead to very high conversions,<br>
-13-<br><br>
however, with the disadvantage of generally being too water soluble to provide for easy recycling of the polymeric amine.<br>
Useful polymeric amines include, for example, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-<br>
1,3-propanediarnine;      N,N,N',N'-tetraethyl-1,3-propanediamine;      N,N,N'-<br>
   tximethyl-N'-tallow-l,2-propanediamine;	N,N,N',N",N"-<br>
pentamethyldiethylenetriarnine,      N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine;<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetramemyl-13-butanediamine;	N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,6-<br>
hexamethylenediamine;  N,N,N',N'-tetraethyl-1,4-butanediarnine;  N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetraethyl-1,3-butanediamine;       ,	N,N,N',N'-tetraethyl-l,6-<br>
   hexamethylenediamine; N,N,N',N'-tetraethyl-l,2-ethanediamine; N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-l,2-ethanediamine; as well as the higher chain homologues and polymers of the foregoing.<br>
In the practice of the present invention, the preferred polymeric amines lead to conversion degrees of at least 97%, preferably of at least 98%.        Additionally, the polymeric amines preferably have flash points of at least 100°F so as to be considered to be combustible from a handling viewpoint. Polymeric amines having flash points of less than 100°F and are considered to be flammable and as such require explosion-proof equipment in order to be handled safely in a commercial environment.<br>
	The  preferred   polymeric   amines   also  have   relatively  low  vapor<br>
pressures in order to minimize evaporation of the polymeric amines. By relatively low vapor pressures is meant vapor pressures of below about 10 mm, preferably below about 3 mm, and most preferably below about 1 mm, when measured at 25°C.<br>
	The polymeric amine in the present invention is preferably used in at<br>
least about an equimolar amount based upon the nitrogen content of the polymeric amine to the molar amount of halide present on the di-substituted phosphorohalidite. That is, the molar ratio of nitrogen in the polymeric amine to the di-substituted phosphorohalidite is at least 1:1, preferably at       least 1.1:1.   An unexpected advantage obtained with the use of a polymeric<br>
-14-<br><br>
amine instead of a monoamine in the present invention Is an increased reactor vessel  utilization  with  the  polymeric   amine.     For  example,  when  the polymeric  amine  is  a  diamine,  a  single  mole  of  diamine  affords  two equivalents of amine nitrogen. When a monoamine is utilized only a single        equivalent of amine nitrogen is obtained per mole of monoamine.  Likewise, when the polymeric amine is a triamine, a single mole of triamine affords three equivalents of amine nitrogen.    Accordingly, more active sites are present in a given volume of a polymeric amine than with a monoamine and greater reaction vessel utilization can be achieved.<br>
	It is during the reaction of the di-substituted phosphorohalidite and the<br>
hydroxy-substituted compound that the corresponding ammonium hydrogen chloride salt is formed between the polymeric amine and the hydrogen chloride by-product (chloride is described herein as PCl3 is the most often used starting halophosphite). Another unexpected advantage of using a      polymeric amine is that less salt is made in the reaction mixture which also is advantage from a process viewpoint. As previously discussed, it is believed that when the preferred polymeric amines are utilized that the salt formed has diminished solubility in the reaction medium and that this diminished solubility drives the reaction to very high conversions. Therefore, it should be        clear that the present invention includes polymeric amines whose hydrogen halide salts have a lower solubility in the phosphite reaction mixture than does the corresponding monoamine salt.<br>
The final proportions of reactants are at least approximately stoichiometric. It is often desirable to work with at least a slight          stoichiometric excess of one of the reactants to help drive the reaction as for to completion as possible.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the polymeric amine salt present in the reaction mixture may be removed by the filtration with the salt washed with additional polymeric amine or a solvent in which the salt is not soluble.<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
Typical solvents suitable for this purpose include, for example, hindered alcohols with isopropyl alcohol being preferred.<br>
The reaction product can be dissolved in an inert organic solvent and<br>
filtered to remove any solid materials.  The solvent can be removed by flash<br>
    distillation   or   another  solvent   removal   technique   or   alternatively,   the<br>
phosphite product can be isolated by crystallization or precipitation from an<br>
inert organic solvent. Typical inert organic solvents include hexane, heptane,<br>
octane, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, and the like.   The phosphite product can<br>
also be purified using melt crystallization techniques or combinations of melt<br>
         crystallization and solvent crystallization and/or precipitation.<br>
It was unexpectedly found that use of a high boiling hydrocarbon solvent in place of the traditional organic solvents mentioned above offers numerous advantages. By high boiling is meant solvents that begin to boil at about 175°C or higher.    The useful upper limit on the boiling point is<br>
      determined, at least in part, by the process engineering equipment that is used to remove the trace amount of solvent residue remaining with the phosphite.  The useful upper limit should be low enough that the amount of solvent remaining is de minimis after treatment to remove the solvent.  The . advantages in using a high boiling solvent include: increased concentrations<br>
     of crude phosphite due to the higher temperature capability, less flammability, reduced solvent loss from evaporation, and less odor from lower vapor pressure. Especially useful high boiling hydrocarbon solvents include those available from Exxon Corporation under the tradename NORPAR. An especially preferred solvent is NORPAR 13.<br>
  	When the phosphite stabilizer is isolated in crystalline form, the<br>
present invention contemplates that it may be utilized in solid amorphous form. The amorphous phosphite composition is formed by rapid cooling of melt of the phosphite. Such melt may be a mixture of the phosphite and polyamine which is rapidly cooled to form a solid amorphous phosphite<br>
        composition. The amorphous nature of composition enhances the hydrolytic<br>
-16-<br><br>
stability of the solid composition compared to crystalline composition containing the same constituents.<br>
The phosphites made by the process of the present invention include all   organic   phosphites.     Especially  preferred   phosphites,   however,   are        sterically hindered phosphites wherein at least of the organic substituents are of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein each R14 is independently selected from the group consisting of t-butyl, t-amyl, t-hexyl, cyclohexyl, cumyl, t-pentyl, and t-octyl, wherein each<br>
     R15 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, t-amyl, t-hexyl, cyclohexyl, cumyl, t-pentyl, and t-octyl, and wherein each R16 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, t-butyl, t-amyl, t-hexyl, cyclohexyl, cumyl, t-pentyl, and t-octyl.<br>
 	The remaining two substituents on the phosphite (i.e., the substituents<br>
present on the di-substituted phosphorohalidite) can be a wide variety of C1-20 hydroxy-alkyl, C6-20 hydroxy-aryl, or C7-20 hydroxy-alkaryl residues. In a preferred embodiment, the remaining two substituents are derived from a diol such that the resultant organic phosphite is a cyclic phosphite.  The diol<br>
-17-<br>
       may contain more than two hydroxyl moieties.    Useful diols include the following compounds:<br><br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, diols of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein each R17 is independently a hydrogen or a C1-10 alkyl group are especially preferred. An especially preferred diol is:<br><br>
It should be clear that the corresponding di-substituted phosphorohalidite          from this diol is 5-butyl-5-ethyl-2-chloro-l,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane.<br>
All patents cited by reference are incorporated herein by reference. In order that those skilled in the art will be better able to practice the invention, the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.        Examples<br>
General Procedure:<br>
-18-<br><br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 2,4,6-tri-t-butylphenol (1.05 mol) and the amine (1.05 mol) and warmed to about 100°C under an inert atmosphere. 5-butyl-5-ethyl-2-chloro-l,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane (1.0 mol) having the formula:<br><br>
was added and the reaction mixture was maintained at about 120° to 150°C for about 4 hours. The degree of product conversion to the tri-substituted phosphite was measured by gas chromotagraphy. At the end of the reaction period, the warm reaction mixture was filtered to remove the amine salt and          the salt was washed with excess amine. The reaction filtrate was combined<br>
with the amine washings and the amine and excess 2,4,6-tri-t-butylphenol was stripped from the solution under vacuum. The final phosphite was crystallized from acetonitrile or isopropyl alcohol. The resultant phosphite had the formula:<br><br>
The recovered amine salt was washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to release the free polymeric amine. Depending on the exact structure of the polymeric amine, heat may be necessary to separate the polymeric amine from the aqueous layer.<br>

As illustrated by the above data, the monoamines (e.g., TBA, pyridine, TPA, DMOA, DMDDA) can in some instances achieve conversions up to about 96%. In contrast, conversions as high as 99.4% have been achieved with the use of a polymeric amine. As previously mentioned, in addition to achieving higher conversions than a monoamine, preferred polymeric amines also have flash points in excess of 100°F and have limited solubility in water such that they can be readily recycled. An especially preferred polymeric amine is N,N,N'N'-tetraethyl-l,3-propanediamine as having a high conversion, a flash point in excess of 100°F, limited solubility in water, as well  as a low vapor pressure to minimize worker exposure.<br>
