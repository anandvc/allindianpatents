				<td>TITLE<br>
"GROUND ENGAGING APPARATUS" FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
THIS INVENTION relates to agricultural apparatus, namely a ground engaging apparatus. The ground engaging apparatus is particularly suitable for, but not limited to, tillage applications and non-till seed planting. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When planting seeds, In particular for large scale applications such as a commercial farm, a ground engaging apparatus such as a planter apparatus may be towed behind a tractor to cut channels or furrows into the soil which is followed by planting of a seed within the channel. Usually, a plurality of planter units are attached to a support towing bar that aligns the planter units at selected distances apart from each and the support bar is attachable to a tractor via a tow bar.<br>
The ground engaging unit may comprise a frame having a pivotable parallelogram arrangement that maintains a ground opening tool in the ground while traversing level and uneven ground. A spring located between two pivotable arms of the parallelogram applies a force that maintains the ground opening tool at a pre-selected depth in the soil as the ground engaging unit encounters inclines and depressions. When the ground engaging unit encounters an obstacle such as a rock or stump, the shank is pivoted upward and away from the obstacle by a break-away or breakout.mechanism to thereby prevent damage to the ground opening tool.<br><br>
The break-away mechanism comprises a spring that applies a force independent of the parallelogram as a separate break-away unit.<br>
A ground engaging apparatus described in Australian patent AU 1996 60854 B2 (714157) (Techsearch Incorporated) comprises a single bias means for adjusting both a downward force to maintain the ground opening tool in the soil at a selected depth and a break-away force that maintains the ground opening tool in the soil unless the planter unit encounters an obstacle. This design is limited in that adjusting the downward force on a parallelogram arrangement also adjusts the breakaway force! which is undesirable in situation where a user wishes to adjust each force independently of the other. Also, a minor adjustment of the bias means to the downward force of the parallelogram has a significant affect on the break-away force, which may result in excessive break-away force applied to the ground opening tool.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Terms used herein when referring to an item or integer are not intended to suggest or imply any limitation to the structure or function of the item or integer.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a side view of a ground engaging apparatus 10 comprising a support plate 50, a shank support 60 and two arms 30,40 each pivotaily attached at opposites ends to said support plate 50 and shank support 60 thereby forming sides of a parallelogram 35. Attachment points A, B, C and D of ends of arms 30, 40 generally define comers of the parallelogram 35. Accordingly, plate 50 and shank support 60 effectively form part of the parallelogram 35. A shank 70, also referred to as a tine, tyne, tine shank or tyne shank, is attached to the shank support 60 and is adjustable relative thereto by loosening and tightening bolts 61. A ground opening tool 80 that Is adapted to disrupt the ground 91, preferably forming a channel suitable for planting seeds, is attached to the shank 70 at a free end opposite the shank support 60. A ground follower 90, shown as a wheel, is attached to shank support 60 and located in front of the ground opening tool 80 at a leading end digging tip 81 of the ground opening tool 80. The wheel 90 contacts the ground 91 as shown and in use assists with guiding and positioning the ground engaging apparatus 10, in particular the ground opening tool 80.<br><br>
The support plate 50 is pivotally attached-to a frame 100 at attachment point A (also referred to herein as a first point). A first bias member 200 is attached to the support plate 50 at pivoteble attachment point E ahd attached to the frame 100 at point 220 as shown in FIG. 1. The first bias member 200 applies a downward force, referred to herein as an applied breakout force, against plate 50 that is countered by stop 210 when there is no reaction or counter breakout force applied to the ground opening tool 80 as discussed hereinafter. Point A is preferably located intermediate the stop 210 and point E, where the first bias member 200 attaches to the support plate 50. Adjusting the distance of the pivot point A to the stop 210 and point E preferably adjusts a force applied by the second bias member 200 about point A. A second bias member 300 is attached at a first end 310 to the housing 100 by member 110 and at a second end 320 to arm 40 as shown In FIG. 1. The second bias member 300 applies &amp; downward force onto the parallelogram 35 at point 320, which is preferably intermediate arm 40. The applied downward force directs the ground opening tool 80 into the ground 91 and is countered by the ground follower 90.<br>
One or more ground engaging apparatus 10 may be attached to a towing cross bar via towing attachment 400 thereby forming a ground engaging assembly. It will be appreciated that preferably there are a plurality of ground engaging apparatus 10 attached to a towing cross bar, which is attachable to a tractor, car, truck, horse, mule, ox or other means for pulling the ground engaging apparatus 10. Preferably, a seed dispenser 82 such as<br><br>
a planting tube 83 is located adjacent to the ground opening tool 80 so that one or more seeds may be deposited within a channef or furrow 92 cut by the ground opening tool 80 when in use. Other substances may be deposited into the channel 92, for example fertiliser and the like,<br>
FIGS. 2 to 5 and 10 to 12 show side views and line diagrams of the ground engaging apparatus 10 in various configurations when traversing different ground levels and when retracted, in these configurations, points A and C are substantially vertically aligned and points B and D are substantially vertically aligned as shown and arms 30,40 pivot about points A, B, C and D. First bias member 200 maintains a constant applied downward breakout force that is countered by stop 210. The second bias member 300 applies a downward force against the parallelogram 35 and a change in ground elevation 91 results in extension and retraction of a hydraulic cylinder of the second bias member 300.<br>
The parallelogram 35 is defined by points A, B, C and D and sides of the parallelogram comprise arms 30,40, support plate 50 and shank support 60. As shown in FIGS. 10-15, points E, A and C form a first single linkage that is capable of uniform movement and points B, D and shank 60 form a second single linkage that is capable of uniform movement<br>
FIGS. 2 and 10 show the ground engaging apparatus 10 in a configuration wherein the ground engaging apparatus 10 is on level ground. As shown, the arms 30,40 are substantially parallel with the surface of the ground 91 and attachment points A and C are substantially aligned vertically<br><br>
with each other and attachment points B and D are also substantially aligned vertically with each other thereby forming a generally rectangular configuration of the parallelogram 35. A downward second force 300a applied by second bias member 300 directs the ground opening tool 80 into i the ground 91 and is countered by the ground follower 90. An applied breakout first force 200a applies a force preventing the ground opening tool 80 from breakout unless a sufficient reaction breakout force 200b is encountered as described hereinafter.<br>
FIGS, 3 and 11 show a ground engaging apparatus 10 in a configuration wherein the ground engaging apparatus 10 is traversing a depression in the ground. In this configuration, arms 30, 40 are pivoted downward thereby lowering points B and D respectively below points A and C. Points B and D are each attached to shank support 60 such that shank support 60 effectively forms an end of the parallelogram defined by points A, B, C and D. Accordingly, when the arms 30,40 are lowered as shown In FIG. 3, shank support 60 is lowered thereby maintaining the ground opening tool 80 in the ground 91. The shank 70 remains substantially vertical. The second bias member 300 is shown extended.<br>
FIGS. 4 and 12 show the ground engaging apparatus 10 in a configuration when traversing risen ground 91. The second bias member 300 is shown retracted and arms 30,40 are angled upward such that points B and D are above respective points A and C as shown.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the ground engaging apparatus 10 retracted such<br><br>
that the ground opening tool 80 no longer contacts the ground 91. This Is useful, in particular, when a plurality of ground engaging apparatus 10 are attached to a support towing bar and only selected ground opening tools 80 are In use. This may be suitable for example when adjusting spacing between planting rows of a crop. The present invention has the advantage of being compact in horizontal length, preferably when the ground opening tool 80 is retracted. As shown, the shank support 60 is lifted substantially vertically with minimum or no outward horizontal extension of the shank 70. This provides a compact configuration of the ground engaging apparatus 10, which is advantageous when compared with other ground engaging apparatus. For example, this configuration Is preferred If seed boxes are fitted as the boxes are maintained horizontally level.<br>
FIGS. 6 to 8 and 13 to 15 show the ground engaging apparatus 10 in a configuration wherein the ground opening tool 80 encounters an obstacle such as a rock, branch, stump or the like. It is desirable that the ground opening tool 80 Is moved away from the ground 91 and obstacle or obstruction to prevent or minimise damage to any part of the ground engaging apparatus. This movement of the ground opening tool 80 away from the ground 91 is referred to herein as a "breakout" or "breakaway* as the support plate 50 is rotated about point A thereby moving an end 51 of the support plate 50 away from the stop 210. The first bias member 200 applies a breakout force 200a as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10-15 that prevents the ground opening tool 80 from breaking away unless the ground opening tool<br><br>
80 encounters a reaction force 200b greater than the applied breakout force 200a applied at point E by the first bias member<br>
FIGS. 6 and 13 show the ground engaging apparatus 10 in a breakout configuration when traversing level ground. An applied breakout force 200a prevents the ground opening tool 80 from breakout unless a sufficient reaction breakout force 200b is encountered, e,g. hitting an obstacle such as a rock or stump. When an obstacle is encountered, a reaction breakout force 200b shown in FIG. 13 moves shank 70 as shown thereby shifting arm 30 rearward thereby causing the support plate 50 to rotate counter clockwise about point A. As the wheel 90 and shank 70 are attached to shank support 60, the breakout force is transferred via a side of the parallelogram 35 defined by points B and D effectively as a single link as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
FIGS. 7 and 14 show the ground engaging apparatus 10 in a breakout configuration when traversing a depression and FIGS. 8 and 15 show the ground engaging apparatus 10 in a breakout configuration when traversing risen ground. Similar applied and breakout forces as previously illustrated are shown.<br>
FIG. 16 shows another diagram representing the structural components of the invention with applied forces indicated. As shown in FIG. 16, a first bias member applies a dominant breakout force 200a to resist breakout away from abutment point 210, which is represented in FIG. 1 as stop 210. The breakout force 200a is applied to B vertical link defined by<br><br>
points E, A and C, wherein point A is a fixed pivot point. A second bias means applies a smaller downward force 300a to the parallelogram 35, preferably via arm 40. The second bias member 300 provides independent adjustment of the downward force 300a without affecting the applied breakout force 200a. In a preferred embodiment wherein the second bias member 300 comprises a hydraulic cylinder, another benefit is an ability to adjust the second bias member 300 without a need to manually adjust the mechanism.<br>
First bias member 200 and second biased member 300 may comprise a spring, hydraulic cylinder or other bias member. Preferably, the first bias member 200 is a coiled spring and the second bias member 300 is a hydraulic cylinder as shown. Use of a hydraulic (or pneumatic) cylinder is advantageous in that adjustment of a force applied by the bias member may be performed remotely for one or more bias members by adjusting a fluid pressure. The fluid may be air. oil, water or any other suitable fluid. In a preferred form of the invention, in use a user Is capable of driving a tractor that is towing one or more ground engaging apparatus 10 and the force of the first bias member 200 and/or second bias member 300 may be adjusted from the tractor without needing to manually adjusting an applied force for each bias member.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the ground follower comprises a wheel, sled, cutting disc, roller or other suitable device. In one embodiment, the ground engaging apparatus comprises both a wheel and a cutting disc<br><br>
for slicing through weeds and other plant material in a path of the apparatus.<br>
The ground opening tool comprises devises and configurations including for example seed shoes, plough shams, seed openers, furrow openers, disc openers, cutting edges and the like. It will also be appreciated thatthe present invention is preferably used with a seed dispenser such as a seed tube or planter tube that releases one or more seeds in a channel 92 formed by the ground opening tool 80. Although there is no need to deposit any material in the channel, preferably seeds, fertiliser, wetting agent or other agricultural material is dispensed in the channel. The seeds may be for any crop, including for example, a vegetable or fruit including a cereal crop, wheat, rice, barley, corn, lettuce and the like.<br>
Although the Invention has been shown and described with exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and additions may be made therein and thereto without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
