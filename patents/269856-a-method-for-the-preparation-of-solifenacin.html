PREAMBLE I O THE DESCRIPTION<br>
["he following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
The present invention relates to a new method for the preparation of Solifenacin of formula (I):<br><br>
and its pharmaceuticallv acceptable salts.<br>
The present invention also relates lo (3/0-1-azabicyclo |2.2.2|ocl-3-y) 4-nitrophenyl carbonate o! formula (IV);<br><br>
which is used as an intermediate for the preparation of Solifenaein.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the compound of formula (IV).<br>
BACKGROUND OK THE INVENTION:<br>
Solifenaein Succinate is commercially marketed as pharmaceutical)}' active substance indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and high urinary frequency. Solifenaein succinate is acting as a selective antagonist to the M (3)-reecptor. The chemical name of the Solifenaein is {)S)-(3R)-]-a/abieylo |2.2.2| Oct-3-yl-3.4-dihydro-]-pheny]-2(1 11)-isoc]uinolinc carboxylate of formula (I);<br>
")<br><br><br>
Formula 1<br>
Solifenacin succinate is the inlcrnaiional common denomination for bulancdioic acid compounded with (lS)-pR)-l-a/abicyclo |2.2.2|oct-3-yl-3.4-dihydro-l-phcnyl-2(ll l)-isoquinolinecarboxylaie (1:1). having an empirical formula ofC23H26N2O2 .C4UO4 and the structure represented in Ibrmuia VI given below;<br><br>
Formula (VI)<br>
Solifenacin and its pharmaceutical!}' acceptable salts arc first reporlcd in US Patent No. 6.017.927 (927"). which disclosed two synthetic routes "Route-A and Roulc-B" for the preparation of (IRS. 3'RS)-So]ifenacin und (IS. 3*RS)-Solifcnacin as shown in Scheme-1;<br>
.3<br><br><br>
Both (he routes have several drawbacks such as:<br>
a)	Use of very hazardous and pyrophoric reagent. Nail, in fhe process which is very diflieuh to<br>
handle and thus makes the process unsafe to handle at industrial level.<br>
b)	Use of ethyichloroformate to prepare ethylcarboxylate derivative in route A which is<br>
lachrymatory in nature.<br>
c)	Hthylcarboxylatc derivative produces elhanol as a by-product during trans-esterifiealion reaction in the subsequcn! reaction that interferes in nuclcophilic attack against Solilenacin in the presence of a base and hence it is necessary to remove elhanol from the reaction mixture in the form of a/.eotrope with toluene or the like simultaneously while carrying out the reaction, so as lo control the reaction.<br>
d)	Use of column chromatography for the purification of solifenacin base, which makes the process industrially not feasible.<br>
0 The reaction requires longer lime for the completion cuid hence turn around lime of ihe batch in production makes it less attractive.<br>
4<br><br>
International  Patent Application No  WO2005/075474 disclosed  another synthetic route  for the preparation of Solifenacin and Solifenaein Succinate as shown in Sebeme-2.<br><br>
Solifenacin succinate<br>
Scheme 2<br>
The above route does not overcome the problems associated with the process disclosed in 927" as the process described in this scheme also uses ehlylchlorofomrate in the first step and produces ethanol as a by-product in the second step.<br>
Yet another International Patent application no W02005/I05795AI discloses an improved process for preparing Solifenacin as represented in Schemc-3. wherein leaving group (l.v) can be II i-imida/ole-1-yl. 2.5-dioxopyrrolidin-l-yloxy. 3-methyl-lH-imidazol-3-ium-l-yl or chloro and further condensation is carried out in the presence of sodium hydride as a base and a mixture of toluene and dimethyUonnamide or toluene alone as a reaction medium. The process described herein represents few draw backs such as. use ofha/.ardous sodium hydride, use of chromatographic purifications, and use of moisture sensitive leaving groups (l.v) and hence handling of the reaction is difficult, further the leaving groups used are expensive and thus making [he process uneconomic.<br>
n<br><br><br>
Hence, there is need of efficient process for producing solifenacin and ils succinate sail which is sale io handle, industrially Feasible, and economically viable.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a new method for the preparation of Solifenacin and / or its salts, wherein the process is economical, simple, efficient, cost-effective and easy io cam' out.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide the new method for the preparation of Solifenacin and /or its salts with high yields and substantially pure and l"rec from impurities and thus making the process efficient.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide the new method for the preparation of Solifenacin and / or its salts in a single pot where in isolation of intermediates by nitrations arc avoided to reduce exposure of the production executive to the chemicals and to reduce the turn around time of the total time cycle per batch.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide the new method for the preparation of Solifenacin and / or its salts which avoids hazardous and costly reagents or chemicals and involves simple work-up thus making the process simple and cost-effective.<br>
6<br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is lo provide the new method for the preparation of Solifenacin and / or its salts in which nitro-phenoi is a by-product which is easily separable and recoverable from the reaction mixture by vacuum distillation and giving monitory benefits to the process.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a new compound. (3/0-l-a/abicyclo|2.2.2|oct-3-yl 4-nitrophcnyl carbonate, of formula (IV). which is used as intermediate for the production of Solifenacin.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of (3/0-1 -azabicyclo J2.2.2] ocl-3-yl 4-nilrophenyl carbonate compound of formula (IV) which is used as an intermcdiale for the production of Solifenacin.<br>
