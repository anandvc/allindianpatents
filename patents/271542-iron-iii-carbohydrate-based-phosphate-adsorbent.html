				<td>Manufacture process<br>
The present invention relates to new iron containing phosphate adsorbent, process for its production, uses thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing it<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Phosphorus is critical for bone mineralization, cellular structure, genetic coding, and energy metabolism Many organic and inorganic forms exist Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and Gl absorption of dietary forms is very efficient Phosphorus homeostasis normally is maintained through several mechanisms (renal excretion, cellular release, hormonal control, etc) When the phosphorus load (from Gl absorption, exogenous administration, or cellular release) exceeds renal excretion and tissue uptake, hyperphosphatemia occurs<br>
Hyperphosphatemia is associated with significant increase in morbidity and mortality, and may induce severe complications, such as hypocalcemia, decreasing of vitamin D production, metastatic calcification Hyperphosphatemia is also contributing to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease among dialysis-dependent patients, and can result in bone pathology<br>
At least 70% of patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure show hyperphosphatemia In many cases, restricting intake of dietary phosphorus is not sufficient to reduce serum phosphate levels into the normal range, and oral phosphate binders need to be taken<br>
Calcium and aluminium salts orally taken as treatment for hyperphosphatemia are known But there are concerns regarding their long-term safety The traditional aluminium-based phosphate binders have the drawback of side effects due to aluminium absorption (osteomalacia, encephalopathy, microcytic anaemia) Calcium-containing phosphate binders (calcium carbonate or calcium acetate) may aggravate metastatic calcification, particularly if they are taken together with vitamin D analogues and a high calcium dialysate concentration<br>
An iron-based ferric citrate phosphate binder, known as Zerenex™, is described in US 6,903.235B Zerenex™ is an oral, inorganic, iron-based compound that has the capacity to bind phosphorous and form non-adsorbable complexes Since this product is soluble its long term administration may induce an increase of the concentration of iron in gastrointestinal tract, which may be safety issue as mentioned hereinabove<br>
Sevelamer, a synthetic polymer commercialized by Genzyme under the name of Renagel®, poly(allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride is an iron exchange gel matrix<br>
The phosphate binding capacity of metal oxide hydroxides is known in the art The possible medical application of metal hydroxides and metal oxide hydroxides as phosphate binders is also described For example WO9201458 discloses a method of controlling serum phosphate level in patients by iron oxy-hydroxides which bind to ingested phosphate<br>
For example, US 6,174,442, the content thereof being enclosed herewith by reference, describes an adsorbent for phosphate which contains polynuclear (3-iron hydroxide stabilized by carbohydrates and/or humic acid WO 2006/000547, the content thereof being also enclosed herewith by reference, describes an adsorbent for phosphate which is obtained from iron(lll) nitrate or sulfate and is stabilized by starch and sucrose<br>
The phosphate binding capacity of the known phosphate adsorbents containing oxide hydroxides is limited Furthermore, the processes described to manufacture such compounds are not suitable for preparing larger amounts of compounds<br>
The possible release of iron under physiological conditions from any iron containing drugs or compounds, in particular in case of the phosphate adsorbent described in US 6,174,442, may be a safety issue, since excess iron is toxic to body organs Preferably the daily release of iron should not be higher than 20mg iron per day A too high release of iron can particularly problematic in case of patients suffering from haemochromatosis Haemochromatosis is a very common genetic disorder of iron metabolism wherein absorption of iron through the intestine is uncontrolled even when body saturation levels have been reached<br>
Furthermore the available phosphate binders and the phosphate adsorbents described in the prior art bind not more than about 120mg phosphate per gram of product Because of the relatively low adsorption capacity of these phosphate adsorbents, the amount of adsorbent, e g the amount and/or number of oral dosage forms containing it to be taken every day<br>
must be high For example the average daily dosage to be taken by dialysis patients in order to avoid/treat hyperphosphatemia is of about 9 capsules in case of Zerenex™, and of 14 film coated tablets in case of Renagel® This indicates that the patient compliance of the available phosphate adsorbents is very low<br>
Due to the high levels of phosphate contained in diet and the relatively low adsorption capacity of the phosphate adsorbents available or described in the prior art, it is necessary to administer such adsorbents in high dose in order to efficiently control the blood level of phosphate Therefore even a small increase in phosphate binding capacity may permit to decrease the dose of adsorbent to be administered every day, for example to lower the number of oral dosage forms to be administered every day So even a small increase in phosphate binding capacity would be beneficial to the patient, e g would improve patient compliance<br>
Therefore there is a need to provide a phosphate adsorbent with a high phosphate binding capacity to be usable as a pharmaceutical<br>
Furthermore there is a need to provide a manufacture process which lead to an adsorbent which is homogenous and stable, and which can be easily formulated and/or packaged, and which can be performed on a large scaling without affecting the properties of the adsorbent, i e its phosphate binding capacity<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention provides a new phosphate adsorbent containing iron(lll) oxide-hydroxide having higher phosphate binding capacity than the phosphate adsorbent available yet, or than the iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent described in the prior art, as well as uses thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing it In particular the present invention pertains to a polynuclear iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent comprising i) an adsorbent base material, preferably a non soluble carbohydrate, n) polynuclear iron(lll) oxide hydroxides, and m) a soluble carbohydrate, wherein the soluble carbohydrate is incorporated, e g partially incorporated, into the polynuclear iron(lll) oxide hydroxides The polynuclear iron oxide hydroxides may be stabilized by soluble carbohydrates   The iron(lll)-based<br>
phosphate adsorbent may further comprise a carbonate, the carbonate may partially incorporated, e g partially incorporated, into the polynuclear iron(lll) oxide hydroxides<br>
The present invention further provides an iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent containing polynuclear iron(lll) oxide hydroxides wherein the polynuclear iron oxide hydroxide contains polynuclear gamma-iron oxide hydroxides, and optionally femhydnte, eg traces of femhydnte The polynuclear iron oxide hydroxide may be stabilized by soluble carbohydrates<br>
It is believed that the iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent according to the present invention is a complex formed with polynuclear iron(lll) oxide hydroxides, insoluble carbohydrate such as starch, and soluble carbohydrate such glucose derivative (e g sucrose or maltodextrin) The iron oxide-hydroxide contained in the iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent according to the present invention would then be a complex, as a whole insoluble under the physiological conditions, which is stabilized by the glucose derivative The glucose derivative is probably acting by preventing the phosphate adsorbent from being overdned during its purification, as overdrying would lead to a loss of the phosphate binding capacity<br>
The present invention further provides a manufacture process for producing an iron(lll) based phosphate adsorbent In particular there is provided a process for manufacturing and isolating the iron(lll) based phosphate adsorbent in a form which is easily packaged, e g as a dry powder suitable for direct sachet filling<br>
Furthermore the present invention provides a manufacture process for preparing oxide-hydroxide of iron having gamma-configuration from iron (III), i e a manufacture process for preparing oxide-hydroxide of iron(lll) having gamma-configuration<br>

Description<br>
lron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that by using dedicated reaction conditions during the manufacture process of a polynuclear iron it is possible to prepare a polynuclear iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent which has a higher phosphate binding capacity than the phosphate adsorbents of the prior art, in particular than the iron-based phosphate adsorbents described in the prior art<br>
Furthermore, in order to obtain an iron oxide-hydroxide containing compound having a good phosphate binding capacity which can be used as a pharmaceutical, it is necessary to have an iron-based compound which is stable It is known that iron oxide-hydroxides, in particular iron(lll) oxide-hydroxides, are not stable compounds during time ageing occurs which leads to the re-grouping of initially randomly placed molecules and to the formation of a more or less regular crystal lattice Ageing usually not only involves crystallization but also particle enlargement Such ageing may alter the phosphate binding of an iron oxide-hydroxide based phosphate adsorbent<br>
Such an ageing may also lead to an iron-based phosphate adsorbent which does release iron The possible release of iron from an iron-containing drug could be a safety concern since an excess of iron is toxic to body organs Therefore there is a need to provide an iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent which does not release iron, or does release only small amounts of iron under physiological conditions, e g an iron amount smaller than the daily acceptable dosage of 20mg iron This means that there is a need to provide an iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent which has a low bioavailability, preferably which is not bioavalaible at all<br>
Therefore it is necessary to avoid the undesired transformation into iron-oxides which would have a lower phosphate binding capacity and/or a higher iron bioavailability Surprisingly, it has been found that it is possible to prevent ageing of the iron oxide-hydroxide by using<br>
dedicated reaction conditions and auxiliary materials like soluble and soluble carbohydrates, e g starch and sucrose<br>
According to the invention there is provided a new iron-based phosphate adsorbent for the adsorption of phosphate, which has higher phosphate binding capacity than the phosphate adsorbents of the prior art, as herein defined as "phosphate adsorbent of the invention" or "compound of the invention"<br>

In yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a new iron-based phosphate adsorbent which releases little iron in simulated gastric fluids (as defined in Pharmacopeia) For example, the phosphate adsorbent of the invention does not significantly release iron at a pH range above 2 up to 10  In one example, 10 g of the phosphate adsorbent of the invention may release less than about 20mg of iron at pH's above 2<br>
In yet a further aspect of the invention the compound of the invention may contain about 10 to about 35wt%, e g about 20 to about 30 wt%, preferably at least about 20 weight % of non soluble carbohydrate, e g starch, for example about 10 to 30, e g about 30, e g about 28 weight % of starch, based on the total weight of the compound<br>

Preferably the phosphate adsorbent of the invention comprises iron(lll), more preferably y-iron(lll) oxide-hydroxide, optionally mixed to fernhydnte In a preferred embodiment, the polynuclear iron oxide hydroxide of the phosphate adsorbent consists of gamma-iron oxide hydroxide (preferably gamma-iron(lll) oxide hydroxide) or mixture of gamma-iron oxide hydroxide with fernhydnte<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compound of the invention is x-ray amorphous<br>
The phosphate adsorbent of the invention is obtained by reacting an aqueous solution of an iron salt, preferably an iron(lll) salt, with an aqueous base wherein the precipitation of the salt is performed in presence of an insoluble carbohydrate, preferably starch The resulting iron oxide hydroxide is stabilized by adding a soluble carbohydrate to the precipitate before the iron hydroxide ages<br>
Gamma-iron (III) manufacture process<br>
It was not expected that it is possible to selectively obtain gamma-iron(lll) (y-iron (III)) oxide-hydroxide, as well as mixtures of y-iron (III) oxide-hydroxide with femhydnte, directly from an iron(lll) source (such as iron (III) chloride) without having to use iron(ll) and a subsequent oxidation step<br>
The present invention also includes a new process for the preparation of gamma-iron(lll) oxide-hydroxide, which process comprises the steps of reacting an aqueous solution of an iron (III) salt with an aqueous base, at pH comprised between 6 and 10, optionally in presence of starch Starch may be added after the reaction of step a), i e after the after the complete mixing of the iron salt with the base<br>
If not present in step a), starch may be added in a further step (step b), e g after the complete mixing of the iron salt with the base In another embodiment, starch is added in step a) and more starch is added in step b)<br>
In both embodiments, the precipitation of the salt by the base is done in presence of starch<br>
Optionally the obtained precipitate is isolated and washed, as hereinbelow defined<br>
In another embodiment of the reaction, the aqueous base may consist of an aqueous basic mixture of a base and starch The reaction may be performed at ambient temperature, or preferably at low temperature<br>
The iron salt may be iron(lll) chloride, iron(lll) nitrate or iron(lll) sulfate, preferably the iron salt is iron chloride<br>
The iron(lll) oxide-hydroxide obtained by that process has gamma configuration Small amounts of femhydnte, e g traces thereof, may also be present<br>
lron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent manufacture process<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that it is possible to obtain iron oxide-hydroxide containing phosphate adsorbent in an excellent quality,  i e   homogenous and stable,  by having<br>
arbohydrates, e g starch and/or sucrose, present during the reaction of the iron with the base and/or by carefully controlling the pH of that reaction The presence of the carbohydrates prevent the ageing of the iron oxide-hydroxide, i e the conversion of the initially formed iron oxide-hydroxide to a less potent phosphate binder Unexpectedly it has been found that by carefully controlling the pH of reaction, a product with an unexpected high phosphate binding capacity can be synthesized<br>
The preparation of iron oxide-hydroxides is known in the prior art and is described in U Schwertmann and M   R  Cornell   "Iron oxides in the Laboratory", Wiley-VCH, Second, completed revised and extended edition, 1991 This document teaches that it is possible to prepare p-iron (III) hydroxide i e to obtain iron(lll) hydroxide with the 3-configuration (beta-configuration) from iron(lll), and to prepare gamma-iron (II) oxide-hydroxide, i e to obtain iron oxide-hydroxide having gamma-configuration (i e y-configuration) from iron (II) It is known that even minor changes in the reaction conditions used to prepare the iron oxide-hydroxide, such as pH, ratio of the base to the iron, iron concentration, etc, may prevent the desired product from being obtained (see page 65 of U Schwertmann and M R Cornell) In particular simply scaling the quantities up or down to produce different amounts, in particular higher amounts, of iron oxide-hydroxide may result in the production of a product having a different structure<br>
In order to obtain an iron-base compound which can be used as a pharmaceutical, it is necessary to have a manufacture process leading to a product always showing a high phosphate binding capacity, e g always having the same structure This need must particularly be fulfilled in case of large scaling up Surprisingly, it has been found that it is possible to prepare large amounts of an homogeneous iron(lll) based phosphate adsorbent, e g several grams thereof, by using adequate reaction conditions, i e , by using a stabilizer during the thermal stress, such as sucrose, and/or by isolating the product by a mild method such as spray drying or fluidized spray drying<br>
The present invention also includes a process for the preparation of a iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent comprising iron(lll) oxide-hydroxide,  insoluble carbohydrate (e g starch) and a soluble carbohydrate (e g glucose derivative), which process comprises the steps of<br>
i)	reacting, e g simultaneously mixing, an aqueous solution of iron(lll) salt with an<br>
aqueous base, at pH between 6 and 10, e g between 6 and 8, between 6 5 and 7 5, preferably around 7,<br>
either performing step i) in presence of an insoluble carbohydrate, e g starch, and optionally adding more insoluble carbohydrate after the complete mixing<br>
or adding the insoluble carbohydrate after the reaction of step i). e g after the complete mixing, wherein in both cases the insoluble carbohydrate is added before completion of the salt precipitation,<br>
n)	isolating the precipitate formed, and optionally washing, e g with water,<br>
m)	suspending the precipitate, e g in water, and<br>
iv)	adding a soluble carbohydrate , and optionally<br>
v)	adding at least one excipient selected from a preservative and a binder<br>
In step i) the aqueous solution of iron(lll) salt with the aqueous base leads first to nucleation and then to precipitation of the iron oxide hydroxide The nucleation may be performed in presence of the insoluble carbohydrate, e g starch, or the carbohydrate may be added after the nucleation, and before the precipitation According to the invention, the precipitation of the salt is performed in presence of the insoluble carbohydrate, preferably starch The insoluble carbohydrate may be added before the precipitation occurs, or during the precipitation Preferably the insoluble carbohydrate is added before the precipitation is complete<br>
Preferably, the aqueous solution of iron(lll) salt is mixed to the aqueous base in presence of the insoluble carbohydrate, e g starch Optionally additional insoluble carbohydrate is then added In another embodiment of the invention, the insoluble carbohydrate is added only after having mixed the aqueous base with the iron salt, for example after the precipitation of the iron salt has started<br>
It is believed that the insoluble carbohydrate may stabilize the precipitate Unexpectedly, it has been found that performing the precipitation in presence of an insoluble carbohydrate increases the phosphate binding capacity of the iron(lll)-based compound thus obtained,<br><br>
preferably starch The resulting iron oxide hydroxide may be stabilized by adding a soluble carbohydrate to the precipitate before the iron hydroxide ages<br>
The iron(lll) salt may be iron(lll) chloride, iron(lll) nitrate or iron(lll) sulfate, preferably the iron salt is iron(lll) chloride, e g solid iron(lll)chlonde hexahydrate The aqueous solution of iron(lll) salt may be in particular a solution of iron(lll) salt, as herein above defined, in water The solution of iron salt may comprise from about 3 to about 35 wt/wt%, eg 20 to about 30 wt/wt% of iron salt, preferably about 25 wt/wt% of iron salt, based on the total weight of the iron salt Preferably, a solution of iron(lll) chloride at about 20 to 30 wt/wt%, preferably about 25 wt/wt%, based on the total weight of the iron salt, is used<br>
According to the invention, it is also possible to use other aqueous iron solution, such as iron alum (e g  KFe(S04)2 or NH4Fe(S04) 2) or sulfunc-acid-containing solutions or iron(lll), e g of iron (III) sulfate<br>
The base to be used may be hydroxide or carbonates of alkali or alkaline earth metals Alkali carbonates, alkali bicarbonates and alkali metal hydroxides (e g of sodium) are preferred In particular, the base may be selected from LiOH, KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, Li2C03, K2C03, CaC03, MgC03, preferably Na2C03 The base solution may comprise about 20 to about 30, e g about 22 to about 27, e g about 25 5 vol% of base, based on the total volume of the solution<br>
The aqueous base may consist of an aqueous solution containing a base, as hereinabove defined, and an insoluble carbohydrate, e g starch<br>
The amount of base is chosen in order to obtain the desired pH, e g to adjust the pH of the solution resulting from the mixture with the aqueous solution of iron(lll) salt to a pH between about 6 and 10, preferably about 6 and 8, more preferably about 6 5 and 7 5, even more preferably around 7<br>
Starch may be selected from corn, wheat, rice, maize or potato starch, and mixture thereof Starch may also contain part of soluble starch (e g maltodextrin) For example, starch may be a mixture of 80 wt% or more of potato starch and 20wt % or less of soluble starch, e g 80 wt% or more of potato starch and 20wt % or less of maltodextrin In another embodiment<br>
of the invention, the starch is replaced by a dietary fiber, e g Benefiber® (produced by Novartis AG) Preferably starch is potato starch<br>
Preferably eg 1 g of insoluble carbohydrate, e g starch, is added per about 0 5 to about 30 g of iron salt, e g per about 1 0 to about 20 g of iron salt, e g per about 1 5 to about 10 g of iron salt, e g per about 2 0 to about 15 g of iron salt<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, in step i) the pH of the solution is maintained constant at a pH between 6 and 8, preferably around 7, during all the mixing By simultaneously addition of the iron salt and the base, the pH can be adjusted to the desired value<br>
According to the invention, the reaction, in particular step i), is preferably made at a temperature between about 1 and 20, preferably 2 to 10, preferably about 5°C In another embodiment step i) is performed at ambient temperature<br>
Subsequently to step n) the suspension may stagnate for a short time, e g more than 1 hour, preferably during 1 to 5 hours, more preferably over night During that time, the suspension can be stirred<br>
According to the invention, the soluble carbohydrate may be a glucose derivative Glucose derivatives may be selected from agarose, dextran, dextrin, dextran derivatives, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, sucrose, maltose, lactose, mannitol and mixture thereof Preferred glucose derivatives are sucrose, maltodextrin and mixture thereof Most preferred glucose derivative is sucrose<br>

Formulation<br>
It is known that iron oxides are difficult to be manufactured because of their dustiness Such a dustiness may also be problematic for formulating iron oxides containing compounds in form of pharmaceutical compositions and/or for packaging such compounds In particular, if iron oxides are to be taken as powder, fine dust can be whirled by air or can even be inhalated, which may lead to losing part of the iron oxides, or taking an incorrect dosage thereof Therefore it is important to prepare a pharmaceutical composition containing an iron(lll)-based phosphate adsorbent which can be safety administered to the patients, in particular whose dosage can be controlled when taken by the patients<br>
In order to obtain an iron oxides containing phosphate adsorbent efficiently suitable as pharmaceutical which can be orally administered, it is necessary to obtain a compound which can be formulated into oral pharmaceutical compositions Typical oral formulation contain excipients present to facilitate automatic compaction or sachet filling However addition of such excipients may affect the phosphate binding capacity of the adsorbent Therefore in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the phosphate adsorbent is in form of a powder Surprisingly it has now been found that by using dedicated processing conditions during the manufacture process, addition of such excipients may be avoided<br>
Due to the daily amount of phosphate eaten every day through food intake and the relative low binding phosphate capacity of the phosphate adsorbents, patients who need to take such compounds, e g suffering from hyperphosphateamia, need to take high amount of them every day Therefore there is a need to provide a phosphate adsorbents in a formulation which could improve patience compliance, for example in case of elderly or pediatric patients A formulation in form of a powder could improve patience compliance in comparison to the phosphate adsorbents commercially available, since the powder could be diluted in water and then permit to take higher doses of phosphate adsorbent with a low amount of liquid<br>
