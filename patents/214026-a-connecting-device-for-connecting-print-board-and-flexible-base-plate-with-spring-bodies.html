DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, a mode for carrying out the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3.<br>
Fig.  1  shows  a  structure  of  the  display  unit<br>
installing  and  connecting  device  in  one  embodiment<br>
according to the present invention.  In Fig. 1, the display<br>
unit installing and connecting device mainly consists of a<br>
holding member 10 to which a liquid crystal display unit 11<br>
and a flexible base plate 12 are fitted to be held, and a<br>
print board 20 provided with light emitting Elements (LED<br>
chips)  22  and spring bodies  21  with which  conductive<br>
springs are molded with resin.<br>
In the forward end of the flexible base plate 2, are<br>
formed  contact  portions  13  and  positioning  holes  14.<br>
■* Further, the holding member 10 has engaging claws 17 in its<br>
bottom part and positioning bosses 16 in the back face<br>
thereof.<br>
Now, fitting and connecting operation of the display<br>
unit installing and connecting device in the embodiment<br>
according to the present invention will be schematically<br>
described.   In Fig.  1,  the light conductive plate 15 is<br>
first placed on a front face of the holding member 10, and<br>
then, the liquid crystal display unit 11 is placed on the<br>
holding member 10.  The liquid crystal display unit has been<br>
assembled with  the  flexible base plate  12  to which a<br><br>
transparent electrode (not shown) of the liquid crystal display element has already been connected by means of conductive adhesive or the like.<br>
On this occasion, the forward end of the flexible base plate 12 is projected from the side face of the holding member 10 where an opening is set to have a width corresponding to a lateral edge of the flexible base plate 12, and then, folded backward in an approximately C-shape.<br>
Through the positioning holes 14 formed in the forward end of the flexible base plate 12 are passed the positioning bosses 16 at the rear face of the holding member 10, AccoK^ingly, the contact portions 13 formed in the forward end of the flexible base plate 12 are made so as to face with the spring bodies 21 of the print board 20. This means that the contact portions 13 formed on the' flexible base plate 12 are made symmetrical at the lateral edge of the flexible base plate 12, while the spring bodies 21 corresponding to the contact portions 13 are also made symmetrical.<br>
Then, the engaging claws 17 of the holding member 10 in which the liquid crystal display unit 11, etc. are assembled and held are locked at determined positions of the print board 20, that are, in recesses formed at longitudinal edges of the print board 20, and at the same time, the positioning bosses 16 of the holding member 10<br><br>
are inserted into positioning holes 24 formed at lateral edges of the print board 20. As a result, the contact portions 13 formed at the forward end of the flexible base plate 12 folded in the rear of the holding member 10 in which the liquid crystal display unit 11, etc. are assembled and held come into contact with forced portions of the spring bodies 21 by spring force.<br>
The display unit installing and connecting device thus fitted and connected is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig, 2 is a sectional view taken in a direction A in Fig. 1.<br>
It is apparent from Fig. 2 that the bosses 16 of the holding member lO are inserted through the positioning holes of the print board 20, and that the engaging claws 17 are locked at the determined positions of the print board 20. As a result, the contact portions 13 formed in the forward end of the flexible base plate 12 and the forced portion formed in the conductive spring 25 of the spring bodies 21 are connected respectively with each other by a determined contact pressure.<br>
In Fig. 2, the liquid crystal display unit which is composed of a glass plate 32, an LCD (liquid crystal display) element (not shown) and a transparent electrode (not shown) is placed on the light conductive plate 15. On the other hand, the liquid crystal display unit is positioned under a transparent plate 31 which is placed on<br><br>
a cover 36 through cushions 35 provided on a periphery of the holding member 10.<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the display unit installing and connecting device taken in a direction B of Fig. 1. It is apparent from Fig. 3 that the light emitting elements (LED chips) 22 are encased in the holding member 10 and that radiant light projected from the light emitting elements 22 is conducted to the light conductive plate 15 by means of a reflecting face formed on the holding member 10.<br>
It will be further understood that the contact portion 13 and tHe forced portion formed on the conductive spring 25 of the spring body 21 are made contact and connected with each other. Fig. 3 illustrates the case where 16 conductive springs are provided on each of the spring bodies 21, but this is only an example to which the present invention is not limited.<br>
In Fig. 3 as well as in Fig. 2, the liquid crystal display unit is composed of the glass plate 32, the LCD (liquid crystal display) element (not shown) and the transparent electrode (not shown) is placed on the light conductive plate 15. On the other hand, the liquid crystal display unit is positioned under the transparent plate 31 which is placed on the cover 36 through the cushions 35 provided on the periphery of the holding member 10.<br><br>
It will be understood from Fig. 3 that the transparent plate 31 is in a form of a lens so that contents of the display unit can be seen in an enlarged scale. The spring bodies 21 are mounted on the print board 20, and so constructed that a plurality of the conductive springs molded with resin and the contact portions 23 formed on the print board are connected with each other at the lower part of the spring bodies 21. It will be further noted that each of the spring bodies 21 is provided with bosses which are inserted through the print board 2 0.<br>
Now, the contact portion 13 in the flexible base plate 12 will be *further explained. There is formed on the flexible base plate 12 an exposed conductive part which is composed of a patterned copper and covered with metal plating of nickel and gold.<br>
The conductive spring is formed of spring beryllium copper or spring phosphorus bronze as raw material, and covered with metal plating of nickel and gold.<br>
The conductive spring consists of a horizontal portion, and a first and second bent portions. One end of the horizontal portion is bent upward arcuately to form the first bent portion, and the first bent portion is bent downward arcuately from a forward end thereof to form the second bent portion, which serves as the contact portion.<br>
The  first  bent  portion  is  imparted  with  spring<br><br>
characteristic. A project area of the conductive spring can be made small by thus bending it and the device can be made compact.<br>
Due to the presence of the second bent portion, the arcuate bent area is adapted to abut the contact portion 13 of the flexible base plate 12 which is assembled from the above. Because the distal end of the spring is bent, the distal end will not abut the contact portion 13 of the flexible base plate 12 thereby preventing damages of the contact portion 13 of the flexible base plate 12, and erosion of the contact portion 13 will be avoided.<br>
The spring bbdy is integrally formed with a plurality of the conductive springs of the same shape which have been previously inserted in metal molds for mold forming. Thg horizontal portion of the conductive spring is so shaped as to be parallel to the print board on which the spring is mounted, and therefore, suitable for re-flowing when mounted on a land of the print board, thereby affording a good mounting ability.<br>
Moreover, a plurality of the conductive springs are made the same in shape, which gives them the same spring characteristics, and a uniform spring force can be given to each contact portion, thereby assuring a stable contact. Further, since all the molds are of the same shape, only a single type of metal mold is sufficient and the production<br><br>
cost will be reduced.<br>
As described in the above, all of the conductive springs (both the contact portion and the horizontal portion), the mounting area (land) of the print board on which the conductive springs are mounted^ and the contact portions of the flexible base plate are provided with metal plating of gold on their surfaces.<br>
This will decrease contact resistance and eliminate the potential difference of the contact portions, thereby preventing electric erosion and assuring a stable contact.<br>
In a space between the holding member and the print board, the folded part of the flexible base plate is arranged in one direction, while in the opposite direction thereto the light emitting elements are arranged. In a direction perpendicular to the above directions are mounted the spring bodies at both ends.<br>
With the described structure, the space between the holding member and the print board can be effectively utilized, and thus the device can be made compact.<br>
In this embodiment, the flexible base plate is formed with the exposed areas of the conductive body to which the contact portions of the springs are abutted, thereby to electrically connect the print board and the liquid crystal display unit. However, in a modified embodiment, the end portion of the flexible base plate may be connected to a<br><br>
second print board on which the conductive body is provided, and the print board of the main body and the second print board are so arranged as to face with each other, with this spring body mounted on one of the print boards so that it may abut the other print board.<br>
In Figs. 1 to 3, there is illustrated no controlling LSI to be mounted on the flexible base plate 12 for controlling the liquid crystal display unit. Because it is well known with respect to TAB (Tape-Automated-Bonding) etc. to install the controlling LSI, the illustration has been omitted here.<br>
The display unit installing and connecting device according to the present invention so constructed as described above comprises a liquid crystal display unit, a flexible base plate connected to the liquid crystal display uni t / a holding member for holding the liquid crystal display unit, a print board to which the holding member is fitted, and spring bodies mounted on the print board and having a plurality of conductive springs molded with resin, the flexible base plate being folded at the outside of the holding meraber, characterized in that the device is further provided with means for electrically connecting the print board to the flexible base plate by means of spring force of the spring bodies. This device has an effect that the print board and the flexible base plate are electrically<br><br>
connected to each other by the spring force by means of the spring body.<br>
The display unit installing and connecting device according to the present invention being thus constructed, there is no need of preparing the connecting terminal formed on the flexible base plate and the connector to be connected thereto, and the print board and the flexible base plate can be electrically connected with a simple operation by the spring force.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
