(+)-l-(3,4-DICHLOROPHEN^L)^3-AZABICYCLOf3.I.01HEXANE,<br>
	COMPOSITIONS AND USES THEREOF	<br>
1,	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicycIo[3.1 .Ojhexane and pharmaceutical salts thereof, compositions comprising (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and methods for treating of or preventing relapse of depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or urinary incontinence in a patient comprising administering to a patient (-r)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.Ojhexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
2.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Depression is one of the most common of the mental illnesses, having morbidity rate of over 10% in the general population. Depression is characterized by feelings of intense sadness, despair, mental slowing, loss of concentration, pessimistic \vorr\", agitation, and self-deprecation {Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 2490-2497 (Fauci ci al. cds., 14'^ ed. 199S)). Depression can have physical manifestations including insomnia, hypersomnia, anorexia, weight loss, overeating, decreased energy, decreased libido, and disruption of nomial circadian rhythms of activity, body temperature, and endosine functions. In fact, as many as 10% to 15% of depressed individuals display suicidal behavior. R J. Baldessarini, Drugs and the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Depression and Mania, in Goodman and Gilman 5 The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Al&gt;\ (9"^ ed. 1996).<br>
United States patent No. 4,435,419 to Epstein et al. discloses racemic, (+)-!-(3.4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane for use as an anti-depressant agent.<br>
Administration of a racemic, /.c, 50:50, mixture of the (+)- and the (-)-enantiomer of any drug, for example (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.Ojhexane, to a patient can be disadvantageous. First, the racemic mixture might be less phamiacologically active than one of its enantiomers, rendering racemic drugs inherently inefficient. Second, the racemic mixture may be more toxic to a patient than one of its enantiomers, so that administration of a racemic mixture can lead to undesirable side effects in a patient.<br>
Accordingly, there is a clear need in the art for an enantiomer of (±)-l-(3,4-dichIorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.L0]hexane, the enantiomer being preferably substantially<br><br>
free of the corresponding opposite enanliomer, which would overcome one or both of the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
Citation of identification of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not 10 be construed as an admission that such reference is prior art to the present application.<br>
3.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyI)-3-azabicyclo[3.1 .Ojhexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyI)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful for treating of or preventing relapse of depression in a patient.<br>
The present invention further provides compositions comprising an effective amount of (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof The present compositions can additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. These compositions are useful for treating of or preventing relapse of depression in a patient.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating of or preventing relapse of depression in a patient, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment or prevention an effective amount of {■i-)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1 .Ojhexane or a pharmacculically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating of or preventing relapse of anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or urinary incontinence in a patient, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment or prevention an effective amount of (-^)-l-(3,4-dichlorophcnyl)-3-a2abicycIo[3.1.Ojhexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof<br>
Preferably, (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.L0]hexane or a phannaceutically acceptable salt thereof, particularly when used in the present methods or compositions, is substantially free of its corresponding (-)-enantiomer, (-)-l-(3,4-dichIorophenyl)-3-azabicyc!o[3.1.Ojhexane. This enantiopurity can be achieved through the use of chromatographic resolution techniques such as chiral chromatography or simulated moving bed technology, or via chemical separation through the employment of optically active resolving agents.<br>
The present invention may be understood more fully by reference to the detailed description and examples, which are intended to exemplify non-limiting embodiments of the invention.<br><br>

4.4.      THERAPEUTIC/PROPHYLACTIC ADMINISTRATION AND<br>
COMPOSITION OF THE INVENTION	<br>
Due to their activity, (+)-l-(3,4-dichloropheny])-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful for the treatment of or prevention of relapse of depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and urinary incontinence-related disorders in a patient.<br>
When administered to a patient, (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is preferably administered as component of a composition that optionally comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. The present compositions, which comprise (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are preferably administered orally. The compositions of the invention may also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with another biologically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, efc, and can be used to administer (+)-!-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1 .Ojhexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof<br>
In certain embodiments, the present compositions can comprise (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.Ojhexane and/or one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Methods ofadministration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode ofadministration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of(+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof into the bloodstream.<br>
In specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.Ojhexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof locally. This may be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to introduce (-»-)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal and epidural injection. Intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.<br>
Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, (■i-)-l -(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and vehicles such as triglycerides.<br>
In another embodiment, (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (5ee Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533; Treat era/., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid, pp. 317-327; 5ee generally ibid.).<br>
In yet another embodiment, (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicycIo[3.1 .Ojhexane and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be delivered in a controlled release system {see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled-release systems discussed in the review^ by Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533) maybe used. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Seflon, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Buchwald ei al., 1980, 5wrge/&gt;'88:507 Saudck et al., 1989, A^. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Florida (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Perfonmance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al, 1985, Science 228:190; During et al, \9%9, Ann. Neurol 25:351; Howard et al, 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105). In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of (+)-l-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-a2abicyclo[3.1.Ojhexane or a phamiaceutically acceptable salt thereof, e.g., the spinal column or brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.<br>
The present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, mammals, and more particularly in humans. The term "vehicle" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or<br><br>
carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered. Such pharmaceutical vehicles can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical vehicles can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. When administered to a patient, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles are preferably sterile. Water is a preferred vehicle when the compound of the invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions.
