or aents to improve plant properties, or as microbicides, for example as funicides, antimycotics,<br>
bactericides, viricides (includin aents aainst viroids) or as aents aainst MLO (Mycoplasmalike<br>
oranisms) and RLO (Rickettsia-like oranisms). If appropriate, they can also be employed as<br>
intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be<br>
understood as meanin in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and<br>
undesired wild plants or crop plants (includin naturally occurrin crop plants). Crop plants can be<br>
plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breedin and optimization methods or by<br>
biotechnoloical and enetic enineerin methods or by combinations of these methods, includin<br>
the transenic plants and includin the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant<br>
breeders' rihts. Plant parts are to be understood as meanin all parts and orans of plants above<br>
and below the round, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned<br>
bein leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes.<br>
The plant parts also include harvested material, and veetative and enerative propaation<br>
material, for example cuttins, tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment accordin to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds/active compound combinations is carried out directly or by allowin the compounds to<br>
act on their surroundins, habitat or storae space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
example by immersion, sprayin, evaporation, foin, scatterin, paintin on, inection and, in the<br>
case of propaation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applyin one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds/active compound combinations can be converted to the customary<br>
formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, water- and oil-based suspensions,<br>
powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, soluble ranules, ranules for broadcastin, suspensionemulsion<br>
concentrates, natural materials imprenated with active compound, synthetic materials<br>
imprenated with active compound, fertilizers and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixin the active<br>
compounds/active compound combinations with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid<br>
carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foamformers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use oranic solvents, for example, as auxiliary<br>
solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are esentially aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or<br>
alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and veetable oils, alcohols,<br>
such as butanol or lycol, as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, stronly polar solvents, such as dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, and also water.<br>

for example ammonium salts and round natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk,<br>
quartz, attapulite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and round synthetic minerals such as<br>
hihly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for ranules are: for example<br>
crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or<br>
else synthetic ranules of inoranic and oranic meals, and ranules of oranic material such as<br>
sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers<br>
are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polylycol ethers, alkylsulphonates,<br>
alkyl sulfates, arylsulfonates, or else protein hydrolyzates; suitable dispersants are: for example<br>
linosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, ranules or latices, such as um arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else<br>
natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in<br>
the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and veetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inoranic piments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide<br>
and Prussian blue, and oranic colorants such as alizarin colorants, azo colorants and metal<br>
phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, mananese, boron, copper,<br>
cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations enerally comprise between 0. and 95% by weiht of active compound,<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound/active compound combinations accordin to the invention can be present in<br>
their commercially available formulations, as well as in the use forms prepared from these<br>
formulations, in a mixture with other active compounds such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizers,<br>

When used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared<br>
from these formulations, the active compounds/active compound combinations accordin to the<br>
invention can furthermore be present in the form of a mixture with synerists. Synerists are<br>
compounds by which the activity of the active compounds is increased without it bein necessary for<br>
the synerist added to be active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms<br>
prepared from these formulations, the active compounds/active compound combinations accordin<br>
to the invention can furthermore be present in the form of mixtures with inhibitors which reduce<br>
the deradation of the active compound after application in the habitat of the plant, on the surface<br>
of parts of plants or in plant tissues.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available<br>
formulations can vary within wide ranes. The active compound concentration of the use forms can<br>
be from 0.0000000 up to 95% by weiht of active compound and is preferably between 0.0000 and<br>
% by weiht.<br>
Application is in a customary manner adapted to suit the use forms.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts in accordance with the<br>
invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species or plant varieties and plant cultivars which<br>
have been obtained by traditional bioloical breedin methods, such as hybridization or protoplast<br>
fusion, and the parts of these varieties and cultivars are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
transenic plants and plant cultivars which have been obtained by recombinant methods, if<br>
appropriate in combination with conventional methods (enetically modified oranisms), and their<br>
parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Plants which are treated particularly preferably in accordance with the invention are those of the plant<br>
cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use. Plant cultivars are understood as<br>
meanin plants with new traits which have been bred either by conventional breedin, by<br>
mutaenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may take the form of cultivars, biotypes and<br>
enotypes.<br>
Dependin on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and rowth conditions (soils, climate,<br>
veetation period, nutrition), the treatment accordin to the invention may also result in superadditive<br>
 ("syneristic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widened activity<br>
spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used in<br>
accordance with the invention, better plant rowth, increased tolerance to hih or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drouht or to salinity in the water or soil, increased flowerin performance,<br>
facilitated harvestin, accelerated maturation, hiher yields, hiher quality and/or better nutritional<br>
value of the harvested products, better storae characteristics and/or processability of the harvested<br>
products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by recombinant methods) to be<br>
treated in accordance with the invention include all those plants which, owin to the process of<br>
recombinant modification, were iven enetic material which confers particular, advantaeous,<br>
valuable traits to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant rowth, increased<br>
tolerance to hih or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drouht or to salinity in the water or<br>
soil, increased flowerin performance, facilitated harvestin, accelerated maturation, hiher harvest<br>
yields, hiher quality and/or hiher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storae<br>
characteristics and/or better processability of the harvested products. Further examples of such traits,<br>
examples which must be mentioned especially, are .better defense of the plants aainst animal and<br>
microbial pests, such as aainst insects, mites, phytopathoenic funi, bacteria and/or viruses and an<br>
increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds. Examples of transenic<br>
plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize,<br>
soybeans, potato, suar beet, tomatoes, peas and other veetable varieties, cotton, tobacco, oilseed<br>
rape and fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and rapes), with particular emphasis<br>
on maize, soybeans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, and oilseed rape. Traits which are especially<br>
emphasized are the increased defense of the plants aainst insects, arachnids, nematodes and slus<br>
and snails, owin to toxins bein formed in the plants, in particular toxins which are enerated in the<br>
plants by the enetic material of Bacillus thuriniensis (for example by the enes CrylA(a), CrylA(b),<br>
CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and Cry IF and their combinations<br>
(hereinbelow "Bt plants"). Other traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased defense of<br>
plants aainst funi, bacteria and viruses by the systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemins,<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance enes and correspondinly expressed proteins and toxins. Other<br>
traits which are especially emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal<br>
active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, lyphosate or phosphinotricin (for<br>
example "PAT" ene). The enes which confer the desired traits in each case may also be present in<br>
the transenic plants in combination with one another. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be<br>
mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars, soybean cultivars and potato cultivars which are<br>
commercially available under the trade names YIELD ARD® (for example maize, cotton,<br>
soybeans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollard® (cotton),<br>
Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be<br>
mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars and soybean cultivars which are commercially<br>
available under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to lyphosate, for example maize,<br>
cotton, soybeans), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI®<br>
(tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulfonylureas, for example maize). Herbicideresistant<br>
plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be<br>
mentioned also include the varieties commercially available under the name Clearfield® (for example<br>
maize). Naturally, these statements also apply to plant cultivars havin these enetic traits or enetic<br>
traits still to be developed, which plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated particularly advantaeously accordin to the invention with the<br>
compounds of the eneral formula  or the active compound mixtures accordin to the invention. The<br>
preferred ranes stated above for the active compounds and mixtures also apply to the treatment of<br>
these plants. Particular emphasis may be iven to the treatment of plants with the compounds or<br>
mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and round synthetic<br>
minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates, suitable solid carriers for ranules are:<br>
for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and<br>
dolomite, and also synthetic ranules of inoranic and oranic meals, and ranules of oranic<br>
material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or<br>
foam-formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid<br>

alkyl sulfates, arylsulfonates and protein hydrolyzates; suitable dispersants are: for example linosulfite<br>
waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, ranules or latices, such as um arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and also<br>
natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the<br>
formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and veetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inoranic piments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and<br>
Prussian blue, and oranic colorants, such as alizarin colorants, azo colorants and metal phthalocyanine<br>
colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, mananese, boron, copper, cobalt,<br>
molybdenum and zinc.<br>

The active compounds/active compound combinations can be applied as such, in the form of their<br>
formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use<br>
solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and ranules. They are applied in the<br>
customary manner, for example by pourin, sprayin, atomizin, spreadin.<br>
The active compounds/active compound combinations accordin to the invention can be applied<br>
both before and after plant emerence. They can also be incorporated into the soil prior to.<br>
plantin.<br>
The application rate of active compound can vary within a substantial rane. Essentially, it<br>
depends on the nature of the desired effect. In eneral, the application rates are between   and<br>
0 k of active compound per hectare of soil area, preferably between 5  and 5 k per ha.<br>
The advantaeous effect of the compatibility with crop plants of the active compound<br>
combinations accordin to the invention is particularly pronounced at certain concentration ratios.<br>

(b) are present per part by weiht of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The active compound combinations accordin to the invention are enerally applied in the form of<br>
finished formulations. However, the active compounds contained in the active compound<br>
combinations can, as individual formulations, also be mixed durin use, i.e. be applied in the form<br>
of tank mixes.<br>
For certain applications, in particular by the post-emerence method, it may furthermore be<br>
advantaeous to include, as further additives in the formulations, mineral or veetable oils which<br>
are compatible with plants (for example the commercial preparation "Rako Binol"), or ammonium<br>
salts, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate or ammonium thiocyanate.<br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or<br>
the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, powders, pastes and ranules. Application is in the customary manner, for example by<br>
waterin, sprayin, atomizin, dustin or scatterin.<br>
The application rates of the active compound combinations accordin to the invention can be<br>
varied within a certain rane; they depend, inter alia, on the weather and on soil factors. In eneral,<br>
the application rates are between 0.00 and 5 k per ha, preferably between 0.005 and 2 k per ha,<br>
particularly preferably between 0.0 and 0.5 k per ha.<br>
The active compound combinations accordin to the invention can be applied before and after<br>
emerence of the plants, that is to say by the pre-emerence and post-emerence method.<br>
Dependin on their properties, the safeners to be used accordin to the invention can be used for<br>
pretreatin the seed of the crop plant (seed dressin) or can be introduced into the seed furrows<br>
prior to sowin or be used separately prior to the herbicide or toether with the herbicide, before or<br>
after emerence of the plants.<br>

Use of safeners<br>
If it is additionally to be tested as to whether safeners can improve the plant compatibility of test<br>
substances in the case of crop plants, the followin options are used for applyin the safener:<br>
seeds of the crop plants are, before sowin, dressed with the safener substance (the amount of<br>
safener stated in percent, based on the weiht of the seed)<br>
before the application of the test substances, the crop plants are sprayed with the safener at a<br>
certain application rate per hectare (usually  day before the application of the test<br>
substances)<br>
the safener is applied toether with the test substance as a tank mix (the amount of safener is<br>
stated in /ha or as a ratio, based on the herbicide).<br>
By comparin the effect of test substances on crop plants without or with safener treatment, it is<br>
possible to assess the effect of the safener substance.<br>
