BIPHENYL AND NAPHTHYL-PHENYL HYDROXAMIC ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to biphenyl and phenyl-naphthyl compounds bearing<br>
a hydroxamic group, which are endowed with antitumour, and anti-angiogenic activity<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity of a few compounds structurally<br>
related to the class of the compounds described in the present invention has been<br>
reported.<br>
(6-[3'-(1-adamantyl)-4'-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (AHPN) also<br>
named CD437) (Cancer Research, 2002; 62(8), 2430-6; Blood, 2000; 95, 2672-82;<br>
Leukemia, 1999, 13, 739-49; Cancer Letters, 1999, 137, 217-2) is reported to be selective<br>
for the retinoic acid receptor-gamma RAR-γ, to inhibit cell growth and induces apoptosis in<br>
breast carcinoma, melanoma and cervical carcinoma cell lines, including those all trans-<br>
retinoic acid- (ATRA-) resistant, with a mechanism independent of receptor binding<br>
(WO9703682; J.Med.Chem. 1995, 38, 4993-5006).<br>
In addition, some compounds related to this class of compounds, such as TAC-101<br>
(Clin.Cancer Res. 1999, 5,2304-10) or derivatives such as RE-80, AM-580 or Am-80<br>
(Eur.J.Pharmacol. 1993, 249,113-6) have shown antiangiogenic properties.<br>
Novel compounds, which are biphenyl derivatives of acrylic acid have recently been<br>
described (Cincinelli R. et al., J.Med.Chem. 2003, 46: 909-912 and WO03/11808). In<br>
particular, compound named ST1926 (E-3-(4'-hydroxy-3'-adamantyIbiphenyl-4-yl)acrylic<br>
acid) was shown to have a potent antiproliferative activity on a large panel of human<br>
tumour cells.<br><br>
WO 2007/000383	PCT/EP2006/062799<br>
2<br>
One of the last developed analogue of CD437, compound (E)-4-[3'-(1-adamantyl)-<br>
4'-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-CI-AHPC) (Dawson, M.I. et al. J.Med.Chem.<br>
2004, 47(14), 3518-3536; WO0348101) is reported to inhibit the proliferation and to induce<br>
apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
Patent JP10182583 discloses some phenylcinnamohydroxamic acid derivatives<br>
having a differentiating-inducing action on cancer cells and useful as a medicines for<br>
treatment of malignant tumours, autoimmune diseases and skin diseases.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the present invention are characterised by the presence of a<br>
hydroxamic group, which surprisingly confers to the compounds an outstanding antitumour<br>
activity. In particular, the compounds of the invention are unexpectedly active on tumour<br>
cell lines, which become resistant to other known antitumour compounds, which belong to<br>
related chemical classes, but do not contain a hydroxamic group.<br>
• R1 is selected from the group consisting of H, adamantyl, Cl;<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide biphenyl and<br><br><br>
WO 2007/000383	PCT/EP2006/062799<br>
3<br>
•	R2 is selected from the group consisting of OMe, Cl, CN, and (CH2)nOH<br>
where n is selected among 0,1 and 2; or<br>
•	R2, taken together with the ring to which it is linked, it forms a methylene- or<br>
ethylene-dioxy derivative;<br>
•	R3 is selected between H and Cl;<br>
•	A is one of the following divalent groups: [CH=CH] (trans), [C=C], or, taken<br>
together with the ring to which it is linked, it forms a naphtyl group.<br>
As already said, the compounds of the present invention show an unexpected<br>
antitumour activity on tumour cell lines, which become resistant to other known antitumour<br>
compounds.<br>
Preferably they have a resistance index lower than 5, more preferably close to 1.<br>
The resistance index is the ratio between the IC50 measured on resistant tumour cell lines<br>
and the IC50 measured on sensitive tumour cell lines [(IC50 on resistant tumour cell<br>
line/IC50 on sensitive tumour cell line)]; for the determination of this value reference is<br>
made to the corresponding section entitled "Biological Studies".<br>

viscosity of the suspension include, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol,<br>
and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions include suitable solutions for administration by<br>
injection, and contain from about 0.01 to 99 percent, preferably from about 20 to 75<br>
percent of active compound together with the excipient. Compositions which can be<br>
administered rectally include suppositories.<br>
It is understood that the dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, sex,<br>
health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of<br>
treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. The dosage will be tailored to the individual<br>

The cytotoxic effect of some biphenyl and phenylnaphthyl compounds bearing a<br>
hydroxamic acid group is reported herein. These molecules possess distinctive<br>
pharmacological features from the corresponding compounds bearing a carboxylic acid<br>
group. The chemical structures of the tested compounds of the invention and of the<br>
corresponding compounds bearing a carboxylic acid group are reported in Figure 1. To<br>
test the effects of the compounds on cell growth, NB4 human promyelocytic leukaemia,<br><br>

NCI-H460 non-small cell carcinoma cells, H460/(R9A) (resistant to carboxylic acid-bearing<br>
compounds: ST1898, ST1926, ST1964), HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells, IGROV-1<br>
and IGROV-1 /Pt (sensitive ovarian carcinoma and platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma<br>
cells, respectively) were used. NB4 and NCI-H460 tumour cells were grown in RPM11640<br>
containing 10% foetal bovine serum (GIBCO), HCT-116 tumour cells were grown in<br>
McCoy's 5A containing 10% foetal bovine serum (GIBCO), IGROV-1 and IGROV-1 /Pt<br>
were grown in DMEM containing 10% foetal bovine serum (GIBCO),<br>
Tumour cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at approximately 10%<br>
confluence and were allowed to attach and recover for at least 24 h. Varying<br>
concentrations of the drugs were then added to each well to calculate their IC50 value (the<br>
concentration which inhibits the 50% of cell survival). The plates were incubated for 24 h at<br>
37 °C. At the end of the treatment, for NB4 tumour cells in suspension, the procedure was<br>
performed as follows: medium culture was removed by centrifugation of the plates at 1600<br>
x g for 10 min and the surnatant was removed. 250 µl PBS were added, then the plates<br>
were centrifuged at 1600 x g for 10 min, the sumatant was removed. 200 µl/well of<br>
medium culture RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS were added and the plates were<br>
incubated at 37 °C for other 48 h. The plates were centrifuged again at 1600 x g for 10<br>
min, the medium culture was removed and 200 ul PBS and 50 ul of cold 80%TCA were<br>
added. The plates were incubated on ice for at least 1 h. TCA was removed, the plates<br>
were washed 3 times for immersion in distilled-water and dried on paper and at 40°C for 5<br>
min. Then 200 pi of 0.4% sulphorodamine B in 1% acetic acid were added. The plates<br>
were incubated at room temperature for other 30 min. Sulphorodamine B was removed,<br>
the plates were washed for immersion in 1% acetic acid for 3 times, then they were dried<br>
on paper and at 40 °C for 5 min. Then 200 µl Tris 10 mM were added, the plates were kept<br><br>

under stirring for 20 min. The survival cell was determined as optical density by a<br>
Multiskan spectrofluorimeter at 540 nm. For the tumour cells in adhesion (NCI-H460 and<br>
HCT-116), the procedure was as above mentioned, except that at the end of the<br>
treatment, the plates were washed by remotion of the surnatant and addition of PBS 3<br>
times without centrifugation. Also the last day of the assay, the surnatant was removed<br>
without centrifugation.<br>
The amount of cells killed was calculated as the percentage decrease in<br>
sulphorodamine B binding compared with control cultures. The IC50 values (the<br>
concentration which inhibits the 50% of cell survival) were calculated with the "ALLFIT"<br>
program.<br>
The resistant tumour cell line NCI H460 R9A was a clone selected for the resistance<br>
to ST1926 (Table 3). To obtain the resistant tumour cell line, the sensitive NC|-H460<br>
tumour cells were treated with 2 µM ST1926 for 24 hours and maintained in drug-free<br>
medium for a recovering time of 7 days. Then, survived cells were cultured applying a<br>
continuous selective pressure of 2 µM (10x IC50)ST1926. Resistant NCI-H460 cells were<br>
subculture for 3-4 times before increasing ST1926 concentration to 4uM (20x IC50).<br>
Survived cells were seeded in 96-well plates to isolate resistant cells clones and<br>
maintained in complete medium with 4 uM of ST1926. The tumour cell line was maintained<br>
at least for one week, before seeding for SRB cytotoxicity assay, in drug-free medium.<br>
Surprisingly, the hydroxamic derivatives ST2782 and ST3056 showed, with respect<br>
the corresponding compounds bearing a carboxylic acid group (ST2188 and ST1898<br>
respectively), an improved anti-proliferative activity on different tumour cell lines (Table 1).<br>
The difference in the activity becomes impressive for ST2782 when compared with<br>

Surprisingly, these compounds were also effective as cytotoxic agents on a lung<br>
carcinoma cell line H460/(R9A) selected for its resistance to compounds bearing a<br>
carboxylic acid group (ST1898, ST1926, ST1964).<br>
To evaluate the effect of the compound on survival cells, the sulphorodamine B test<br>
was used. The amount of cells killed was calculated as the percentage decrease in<br>
sulphorodamine B binding compared with control cultures. The IC50 values (the<br>
concentration which inhibits the 50% of cell survival) were calculated with the "ALLFIT"<br>
program.<br>
As shown in Table 3, while the corresponding compounds bearing carboxylic acid<br>
groups, e.g. ST1926, ST1964 (CD437), ST1898 were 34-78 fold less effective on<br>
H460/R9A, the hydroxamic derivatives e.g. ST2142, ST2992, ST3056, completely<br>
overcame the resistance, thus confirming that the selected compounds had specific<br>
pharmacological differences from the corresponding carboxylic compounds. Interestingly,<br>
the same characteristic are retained by ST2782, ST3081 and ST3088.<br>

Cytodifferentiatinq actiyity<br>
Results<br>
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a form of acute myelogenous leukemia with<br>
typical chromosomal translocations leading to the expression of abnormal fusion proteins<br>
involving the nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α. These fusion proteins act as<br>
oncogenes and are responsible for the differentiation block and the expansion of the<br>
leukemic clone. In the majority of APL patients, the translocation involves chromosomes 15<br>
and 17 and leads to the synthesis of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-RARα. APL is the<br>
object of intense study, as it represents the only example of neoplastic disease that can be<br>
treated with a cytodifferentiating approach. APL patients are induced into clinical remission<br>
with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which forces the leukemic blast to acquire many of the<br>
characteristics of the terminally differentiated neutrophils. These include a short lifespan<br>
and the propensity to undergo a natural process of programmed cell death or apoptosis.<br>
Although the success obtained with APL patients has raised enthusiasm for the<br>
clinical use of ATRA in the treatment of leukemia and other neoplastic diseases, the<br>
therapeutic efficacy of this compound is still burdened by problems such as resistance and<br>
toxicity. One possible strategy to increase the therapeutic index of ATRA is the<br>
development of ATRA-based pharmacologic combinations that are more powerful and<br>
easily tolerated than the individual components.<br>
Relevant aspects of the differentiation program set in motion by ATRA in APL cells<br>
can be reproduced in primary cultures of leukemic blasts and in the derived NB4 cell line,<br>
which is a unique model for the study of the pharmacologic activity of ATRA and<br>
derivatives. Pharmacological concentrations of ATRA arrest the growth of NB4 blasts and<br>
differentiate them into cells that resemble mature neutrophils. This is followed by a slow<br><br>
WO 2007/000383	PCT/EP2006/062799<br>
33<br>
process of apoptosis. As reported in the Table 3, we used NB4 cells to demonstrate that<br>
such different compounds potentiate the pharmacologic activity of ATRA. In particular, the<br>
differentiation of NB4 tumour cells induced by the compounds was determined by nitroblue<br>
tetrazolium (NBT) reduction. NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia cells were seeded at a density<br>
of 150000 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. To measure the<br>
cytodifferentiating effect of the molecules, tumour cells were treated with the compounds<br>
at different concentrations starting from at least 0.4 pµM to 0.01 µM, whereas to measure<br>
the enhancing action of the molecules of ATRA activity, NB4 cells were treated with<br>
increasing concentrations of the molecules in the presence or absence of ATRA at a<br>
suboptimal concentration (5 nM).<br>
Tumour cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C without replacing the medium<br>
culture. To measure the prodifferentiative effect, 500,000 cells were collected, centrifuged<br>
and resuspended in 1 ml of RPM11640 medium containing 10% FCS, 1 mg/ml of nitroblue<br>
tetrazolium (NBT) and 100 ng of PMA (4-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate). The tumour<br>
cells resuspended were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. At the end of the incubation, tumour<br>
cells were centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing Triton<br>
x100 at 10%. The samples were sonicated and the absorbance was determined at 540 nm<br>
with a spectrophotometer. Differentiation of tumor cells as AC50 (activating concentration)<br>
was evaluated as the concentration of the compound giving 50% of the maximal induction<br>
of NBT-reducing activity with or without ATRA. As shown in Table 4, the compounds alone<br>
were not able to induce differentiation of NB4 tumor cells, whereas when they were<br>
combined with a suboptimal concentration of ATRA (5 nM), some molecules increased<br>
ATRA-induced differentiation. The most potent compounds was ST2992 with an AC50<br><br>

value of 0.19 µM comparable to ST2142 (AC50= 0.31 uM) followed by ST2782 with<br>
AC50 values ranged from 2.47 µM.<br>
Surprisingly, none of the closest analogues (ST1926, ST1964, ST3444, ST3256,<br>
ST3400) showed similar results.<br>
