The graft polymerization onto the graft base may be carried out in suspension, dispersion or emulsion. Continuous or discontinuous emulsion polymerization is preferred. The graft polymerization is carried out with free-radical initiators (e.g. peroxides, azo compounds, hydroperoxides, persulfates, perphosphates) and optionally using anionic emulsifiers, e.g. carboxonium salts, sulfonic acid salts or organic sulfates.<br>
The graft shell may be formed of a mixture of<br>
I.	0 to 80%, preferably 0 to 50%, especially 0 to 25% (based on the weight of the graft shell), of vinyl aromatic compounds or ring-substituted vinyl aromatic compounds (e.g. styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene), vinyl cyanides (e.g. acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile), and<br>
II.	100 to 20%, preferably 100 to 50%, especially 100 to 75% (based on the weight of the graft shell) of at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters (e.g. methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert.-butyl acrylate) and derivatives (e.g. anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids (e.g. maleic anhydride and N-phenyl maleimide).<br>
The preferred graft shell includes one or more (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters, especially methyl methacrylate.<br>
Particularly suitable graft (co)polymer is available from Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd. under the Metablen trademark.<br>
The inventive composition may further include additives that are known for their function in the context of thermoplastic compositions that contain poly(ester)carbonates. These include any one or more of lubricants, mold release agents, for example pentaerythritol tetrastearate, nucleating agents, antistatic agents, thermal stabilizers, light stabilizers, hydrolytic stabilizers, fillers and reinforcing agents, colorants or pigments, flame retarding agents and drip suppressants.<br>

The Examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In preparing the exemplified compositions that are described below the following materials were used:<br>
Polycarbonate - a mixture containing about 85 wt.% homopolycarbonate based on bisphenol A (MFR 13 g/10 min.) and 15 wt% homopolycarbonate based on bisphenol A (MFR 38 g/10 min.)<br>
First graft polymer - a mass polymerization ABS resin having polybutadiene rubber content of about 15% relative to the weight of the resin and weight average particle size of about 3 microns<br>
Linear glycidyl ester copolymer -   Lotader 8900 terpolymer a product of Arkema containing about 30 percent by weight of ethyl acrylate, 62 percent by weight of ethylene, and 8 percent by weight of glycidyl methacrylate having reactive epoxy groups.<br>
Second graft copolymer 1 - methyl methacrylate (MMA) - grafted siloxane(Si)-butyl acrylate (BA)composite rubber containing MMA shell and Si-BA in the core, silicon content about 16% by weight. (Metablen S2001 a product of Mitsubishi Rayon)<br>
Second graft copolymer 2 - methyl methacrylate (MMA) - grafted siloxane(Si)-butyl acrylate (BA)composite rubber containing MMA shell and Si-BA in the core. Silicon content of about 81% by weight. (Metablen SX005)<br>
All the exemplified compositions contained 64.51 percent polycarbonate (the percent relative to the weight of the composition-herein pbw) 30.79 pbw first graft polymer and 0.7 pbw of a mixture of conventional release agent and thermal stabilizer, the mixture having no criticality in the context of the invention. The balance, 6 pbw containing the indicated amounts of linear glycidyl ester copolymer and second graft (co)polymer.<br>
The preparations of the compositions and molding of test specimens were conventional. The melt flow rate (MFR) determined per ASTM D 1238 at 260°C; 5Kg load. 60°Gloss was determined in accordance with ASTM D523 the impact strength was determined as Izod at 1/8" at room temperature (RT) and at the indicated temperatures.<br>
The tables below summarize the results of these tests.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The Second Graft Polymer included in the compositions shown in Table 1 is characterized in that it contains silicon in an amount of about 16% by weight.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The Second Graft Polymer included in the compositions shown in table 2 is characterized in that it contains silicon in an amount of about 81% by weight.<br>
The results demonstrate the lowered gloss of the composition attained by the inclusion of both "second graft polymer" and "linear glycidyl ester". Singly, each of these compounds increases the gloss of the composition. The surprising advantageous gloss values are attained without appreciably practical effect on processability and impact strength.<br>
