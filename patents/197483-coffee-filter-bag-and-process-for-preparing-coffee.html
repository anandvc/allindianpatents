				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a coffee filter bag and process for preparing coffee especially adapted for preparation and serving in pressurized cabins such as aircraft cabins.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Coffee is usually prepared by brewing the ground coffee powder in hot water.<br>
One major drawback in preparing coffee in a pressurized cabin is the constraints on boiling of water. In pressurized cabins such as an aircraft during flight, due to the pressure constraints water boils at 80°C, which is below its normal boiling point of 100°C at normal atmospheric pressure. Due to the lower temperature of the water, hot water used in-flight fails to brew coffee to the required strength and flavor.<br>
Further, the coffee bags already in use for making coffee is deficient for a number of reasons. The filter paper used in the coffee bag is usually of 21 GSM (grams per square meter) and therefore does not allow for optimal extraction of coffee. Further, the coffee powder in the bag forms a lump when wet and the hot water does not penetrate the innermost particles of ground coffee in wet mass. Then again by the sheer weight of the wet coffee the filter paper has been known to tear, dumping the entire lot of coffee powder into the water.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a coffee filter bag which is made of a unique filter paper and so sectioned so as to provide optimal extraction of coffee blends even when the water used for brewing is heated to 80°C much below its boiling temperature of 100°C.<br>
Another object of the instant invention is to brew coffee by steeping or by infusion get a ready brew without the use of any pressure, boiling of coffee bags or using any machine to brew the coffee due to unique quality of paper and its construction into coffee filter bag.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for brewing coffee in a pressurized cabin such as in flight with the limitations on board an aircraft while preserving the utmost aroma and flavor without allowing a trace of bitterness.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides for a coffee filter bag of heat sealeable filter paper wherein<br>
-	said bag has a plurality of sections with a breadth in the range of 55<br>
mm to 65 mm and length in the range of 65 mm to 75 mm, enabling<br>
even distribution of a given quantity of coffee powder for uniform<br>
wetting of said coffee powder thereby allowing optimum extraction<br>
of coffee, easy removal of the used coffee bags from the brewing /<br>
vacuum pot without tearing the wet / used coffee bag, due to<br>
distributed weight,<br>
-	each said section having a predetermined quantity of special roast<br>
and ground aeroblende coffee powder comprising two varieties of<br>
coffee in the ratio of 50:50,<br>
-	said heat scalable filter paper has a basis weight of 15 GSM to 21<br>
GSM said coffee bags being packed and sealed to preserve freshness,<br>
in a triple laminated master pack, each master pack containing 6 to<br>
10 coffee bags.<br>
The  present  invention  also  provides  for  a process  of preparing  an aeroblende coffee powder as claimed in claim 1 comprising:<br>
-	selecting the two varieties of coffee<br>
-	roasting the said varieties of coffee in a manner as herein described<br>
-    mixing the said varieties in the ratio of 50:50 to obtain the aeroblende coffee powder<br>
The instant invention provides for a process for brewing coffee using the coffee filter bag of any of the preceding claims by steeping or by infusion using said sectioned bags comprising the steps of:<br>
opening the said master pack and placing coffee bags in an empty<br>
brewer / vacuum pot, such that the strings are hanging out of the<br>
mouth of the said pot,<br>
pouring water heated to a minimum of 80°C upto 100°C in the<br>
said pot,<br>
closing the lid for a minimum of 8 minutes, to avoid loss of aroma<br>
and temperature,<br>
creating a turbulence inside the said pot to optimize extraction by<br>
wetting the said coffee bags, by holding the handle of the said pot<br>
and swirling the brew for 30 seconds to a minute,<br>
opening the lid of the said pot and removing the coffee bags by<br>
means of the attached strings, and disposing the used coffee bags,<br>
closing the lid and pouring the coffee brew in a cup,<br>
adding milk and sugar to taste.<br>
Brief description of the invention:<br>
Due to unique quality of paper and its construction into coffee filter bag, and the grinding of the coffee bean blend to a grind size which optimizes extraction in hot water available on flight, a ready brew of good strength and aroma without a trace of bitterness is obtained without the use of any pressure, boiling of coffee bags or using any machine to brew the coffee.<br>
The method of brewing the aeroblende, in a pressurized cabin for e.g. inflight is by steeping or infusion using "sectioned packaging".<br>
In the instant invention coffee is brewed by steeping rather than by Alteration. Ground coffee packed in the "sectioned" filter paper bag, are<br>
steeped in hot water in a vacuum pot and allowed to steep for a minimum of eight minutes.<br>
Hot water will extract all the aromatic constituents provided that over extraction does not occur through reheating, overheating, or allowing the grounds to stand in liquid for too long.<br>
A major advantage of sectioning the coffee filter bag is that the mass of the coffee powder is so distributed that the hot water wets all the coffee grains, thus optimizing extraction. Usually the coffee powder forms a mass at the bottom of the thermos in such that the hot water rarely wets the innermost coffee grains. Alternatively allowing the grains to stand too long in the water leads to bitterness in taste.<br>
Another major advantage is that since the weight of the coffee powder is evenly distributed throughout the coffee filter bag in sections, the weight of the wet coffee powder does not tear the filter paper by forming a lump at the bottom of the coffee filter bag. Another advantage of sectioning is that the even distribution of the wet coffee powder in the sections does not hamper the removal of the bags from the usually narrow mouth of the vacuum pots.<br>
This light roast coffee offers medium body and good acidity. Aromatic, sweet, mellow with a short, clean aftertaste.<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
The Coffee Filter Bag has unique configuration in which each filter bag is sectioned in two equal parts or more. Each of these sections carries specially roasted and ground coffee powder. This unique feature is the highlight of this invention for two reasons<br>
The ground coffee is distributed in two sections or more.<br>
When coffee bag is immersed in hot water for brewing it allows uniform extraction so that the weight of wet coffee does not tear the coffee bag and also coffee does not become lumpy and cause uneven extraction.<br>
FILTER PAPER used for the preparation of coffee bag is of particular specifications, especially prepared to ensure that the while there is high levels of dust retention with excellent infusion, wet strength and heat seal delamination strength, the infusion is quick and efficient.<br>
The heat-sealeable filter paper consists of a lightweight, two-phase heat sealeable tissue featuring a small diamond pattern. The said tissue comprises of a special blend of thermoplastic fibres, abaca and selected cellulosic fibres. The tissue has high wet strength which when combined with neutral odour and taste characteristics makes the tissue ideal for infusion application.<br>
It has been found that the filter paper functions optimally at a basis weight of about 16.5 gsm (grams per square meter), a dry tensile MD of 520 N/m, Dry tensile CD of 166 N/m, wet tensile CD of 6.9 N/m, Elmendorf Tear MD of 230 mN and a Peak Peel of 275 g / 25 mm.<br>
The coffee bags using the filter paper is segmented into sections. Each coffee bag has 2 to 4 sections, with each section containing specially roasted and ground coffee hereafter referred to as Aeroblende coffee powder.<br>
Preparation of the special roasted and ground aeroblende coffee powder;<br>
The Aeroblende coffee powder is a special proprietary coffee powder blend of 4 varieties of shade grown green beans, selectively hand picked from the picturesque Coorg region. Estate specific these coffees allow a consistent taste profile. They are put through wet processing and careful drying at individual estates.<br>
Green coffee after processing will keep for several months without deterioration. Before it can be used it has to go through a very important process of roasting, which it will develop its characteristic aroma and flavor.<br>
The varieties of the proprietary blend is roasted, cooled and blended. The blended beans, which are blended in a given proportion per 100 grams, are then cooled for degassing. The cooled blended coffee beans are then ground to a given specification, and packed in specially designed SECTIONED filter bags.<br>
Thus the two processes of roasting and grinding performs the functions of "cooking" the coffee beans to develop the aromatic constituents sufficiently and opening the cells of the beans, so that they are ready to be dissolved in water heated to temperatures ranging from 80°C to 100°C.<br>
Details Of Blend<br>
Estate Processing: The ripe fruits of Arabica and Robusta coffee are grown in the estates of Jumboor, Kibberibetta and Pollibeta, which are selectively hand picked.Jby workers and subjected to wet processing at the estate pulp house. After the removal of fruit skin in the pulping machine, the wet parchment is subjected to natural fermentation for 36 hours followed by washing in Aqua washer for complete removal of mucilage. The washed pebble - clean parchment is sun dried on the estate-drying yard.<br>
Curing: The dried Arabica parchment and Robusta parchment coffee lots are cured and graded at the companies ISO 9002 certified curing factory at Kushal Nagar. Perfect grading of beans by size and density is done and removal of defective green beans. The curing work has an attached Quality control laboratory. The prime grades of coffee obtained are screened once again based on visual and cup quality parameters and the coffee lots selected for the preparation of the Aeroblende blend.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Roasting Specifications<br>
Roasting is the key stage in the processing of coffee as it is at this point that the characteristic taste and aroma of the beans is developed.<br>
The roasting process involves applying heat to the beans from an external source, which causes changes in their physical structure and to their chemical composition. The water in the beans conducts the heat, passing it rapidly from cell to cell. The heat also causes the beans to increase in size. Gradually the green beans turn a yellowish brown, then eventually darken to a deep rich brown. During this color change, a number of chemical reactions occur, causing sugars and proteins to interact with each other. It is these changes, which are essential to bring out the flavor and aroma of the beans. During roasting the beans gain 25-35% in volume, but lose 18-22% of their weight. The caffeine content however is not affected significantly.<br>
The extent, to which the characteristics of the beans are developed, especially as regards depth of color and fullness of flavor and aroma, depends on the duration and temperature of the roasting process.<br>
The process for preparing the coffee beans for Aeroblende coffee powder is as follows:<br>
The roaster is preheated to 150°C to 160°C before adding the first batch of green beans. Between batches, the temperature of the roasting drum is brought down to 150°C before adding the next lot of green beans for roasting.<br>
During roasting of the green beans, the temperature of the roasting drum is gradually increased to 183°C, which is maintained for about 16 minutes. In the last 2 to 3 minutes, the temperature of the drum is raised to 190°C to a maximum of 199°C at which point roasting is stopped and the roasted beans released into cooler.<br>
It is the practice to switch off the roaster when drum temperature reaches 192-195°C. Even so the drum temperature will continue to rise unto a final of 199°C From then on, roasting is controlled by the roast master by checking the color of beans visually by matching color to benchmark samples.<br>
All through the roasting process the temperature of the Inlet air is maintained at the temperature of the drum, which is monitored every 2 minutes right through the roasting process. Each batch of beans is roasted for 16 to 19 minutes.<br>
Robusta Parchment AB and Robusta Parchment PB are mixed and roasted together in the same batch, while the two varieties of arabica are roasted separately. Each batch of green beans per cycle is limited to 80 Kgs.<br>
After roasting the beans are mixed in a proportion as given below and are cooled for 8-10 minutes for degassing in inbuilt cooling trays.<br>
Fuel temperature to not rise above 480 Celsius at any given point during roast cycle. The roasted beans are cooled by cool air to curtail further cooking of the coffee beans. The four varieties of roasted beans are then blended in proportion to the recipe of this unique Aeroblende suitable for the infusion method of brewing.<br>
The proportion of the coffee bean varieties for every 100 gms of coffee beans to prepare Aeroblende coffee powder is as given below:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
After blending the coffee is ground, left for 8 hours for degassing and then packed in specially designed paper filter bags and finally in master packs.<br>
Grind Specifications Of Aeroblende Coffee Powder Is As Follows<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Process of brewing coffee<br>
The process of brewing the coffee in-flight or in any pressurized cabin is simplified by the use of sectioned coffee filter bags and the special aeroblende coffee powder. A brewer or a vacuum pot or thermos usually of one-liter capacity is used in the process. The coffee filter bags are placed in the vacuum pot leaving the strings outside. Water from the aircraft boiler is poured into the vacuum pot. The pot is sealed with its lid and the coffee blend in the coffee filter bags is allowed to steep in the hot water for a period of 8 to 10 minutes. The pot is then swirled by its handle to facilitate uniform infusion of the coffee blend in the hot water. The infused brew is then poured into individual cups and served with milk and sugar added according to taste.<br>
SHELF LIFE<br>
The Master pack must be used within one month of packaging.<br>
The invention shall now be explained by the following examples. These examples are not to be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1:<br>
Grind size of aeroblende:<br>
In order to obtain optimum extraction from the ground coffee using the infusion method of brewing, the roasted beans are ground to the following specifications.<br>
The grinder used is Swiss made DITTING, Model: KFA 903.<br>
The grinder Ditting is set to the grind size of 6 Ditting. This setting was selected after several trials. The coffee powder at this setting yields 6 cups of 120 Ml from 56 grams of coffee powder.<br>
If the grind size is kept below 6 Ditting, the coffee is ground too fine and the the fine particles come out of the filter paper thus making the brew turbid.<br>
The extraction with coffee ground to a size of more than 6 Ditting was weak and the extraction poor.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
Sectioned coffee bags for use in flight for brewing coffee uses filter paper of the following configuration:<br>
size	62.5 x!40 mm<br>
Paper size	125x140 mm<br>
GSM of paper	16.5 Gsm<br>
The sectioned coffee bags may then be packed in the following two packing configuration as per convenience:<br>
Option 1<br>
Bags per pouch	8 nos<br>
Coffee per bag	8 CMS<br>
No. of sections per bag	2<br>
Coffee Per section in each coffee bag	4 CMS or more<br>
Coffee per pouch	64 GMS<br>
Option 2<br>
Bags per pouch	8 Nos<br>
Coffee per bag	8 GMS<br>
No. of sections per bag	•      4<br>
(Multiple sectioned packs)<br>
Coffee per section in each coffee bag	2 GMS or more<br>
Coffee per pouch	64 Cms<br>
Ideally the filter bag is divided into at least two equal sections with 4 Gms of freshly roasted and ground aeroblende coffee in each section. Eight of such coffee bags are then packed into one master pack made of triple laminate to retain freshness and flavor.<br>
EXAMPLE 3:<br>
Process of brewing coffee using aeroblende coffee powder<br>
Take a clean one-liter coffee vacuum pot. Cut open one Master pack from top of pack while ensuring that strings of coffee bags are not cut. The Master pack contains two set of coffee bags, each set having 4 coffee bags of 2 sections each tied together.<br>
Put both sets of coffee bags into the coffee pot, i.e. a total of eight coffee bags in one coffeepot of one-liter capacity. Leave strings out of the vacuum pot. Fill the flask with hot water from aircraft boiler till the top, which will be approximately 900 ml. Close the lid tightly so that there is no aroma and temperature loss.<br>
Leave to brew for minimum 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, hold flask by handle and swirl the brew in it well in a circular motion. This is important to create turbulence to extract fully.<br>
Open lid, pull out coffee bags and dispose. It is essential to be careful to take out one lot at a time, as the mouth of the flask is narrow. Close lid and pour the coffee in a cup. Add fresh milk and sugar to taste.<br><br><br><br>
