				<td>Electrical Machine<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the invention relate to an electrical machine that can function as<br>
either a motor or a generator. The machine uses high frequency commutation of<br>
magnetic flux to achieve high efficiency and high power density.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Motors and alternators are designed for high efficiency, high power density, and<br>
low cost. High power density optionally is achieved by operating an alternator at high<br>
rotational speed and therefore high electrical frequency. However, high electrical<br>
frequency results in high core losses and lower efficiency. It would be desirable to<br>
provide a motor and alternator which had very low core losses thus making it practical to<br>
run it at high electrical frequency.<br>
If a high rotational speed cannot be provided then the prior art motor or alternator<br>
must have a large number of poles to provide a high electrical frequency at low rotational<br>
speed. There is a practical limit to the number of poles a prior art motor or alternator can<br>
have due to space limitations, so once that limit is reached in order to reach a certain<br>
power level the motor or alternator must be relatively large and have the low power<br>
density inherent in low rotational speeds. It would be desirable to provide a motor or<br>
alternator that could have many times the number of poles currently possible providing<br>
high power density and good efficiency even at low rotational speed.<br>
Another issue with prior art motors and alternators is that they require either a<br>
permanent magnet or an electromagnet to provide a magnetic field. Each type of magnet<br>
has some advantages and some disadvantages so that it is necessary to make a trade-off<br><br>
decision between the two types of magnets. Permanent magnets provide simplicity and<br>
they have the advantage that they do not require electrical input and thus allow a<br>
brushless motor or alternator. Permanent magnets also make it possible to design a motor<br>
or alternator of relatively high power density. However, they do not allow for operation<br>
over a wide speed range and they cannot be de-energized if desired. Electromagnets can<br>
be de-energized however they take up more space and require slip rings to draw power,<br>
power which is a parasitic loss for the system. Therefore, to avoid the need for a clutch,<br>
many machines must settle for a motor or alternator with lower power density, lower<br>
efficiency, and higher complexity. It would be desirable to provide a motor and<br>
alternator that could combine the advantages of permanent magnets and electromagnets.<br>
The design trade-offs of existing motors and alternators have hindered<br>
commercial success of some motors and alternators. For instance, hub motors to drive<br>
the wheels of vehicles have not been commercialized because the low speed output<br>
requires a large motor that is not compatible with weight and size requirements of a<br>
vehicle suspension and drive system. A successful hub motor would require a power<br>
density that is many times higher than provided by prior art motors and it would have to<br>
maintain good efficiency and have variable field strength. Such a motor would go a long<br>
way toward making electric vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles commercially<br>
acceptable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide a motor/alternator that provides a<br>
power density that is many times higher than prior art devices. This is achieved primarily<br>
by greatly reducing the core losses, allowing the motor/alternator to run at a much higher<br><br>
electrical frequency. Since it operates at high electrical frequency, at a given rotational<br>
speed , if the device is operated as an alternator, the output voltage is higher than for a<br>
prior art alternator. This reduces the current flowing through the windings and<br>
substantially lowers resistive losses in the device.<br>
Conventional motors and alternators use varying electrical current within the<br>
windings to create a varying magnetic field in either the stator the rotor or both.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention instead vary a constant magnetic field by altering<br>
the flux path of said magnetic field. Hysteresis and eddy currents are the main sources of<br>
core loss. Hysteresis is caused by the reversal of magnetic polarity in a material and eddy<br>
currents are caused by change of magnetic field strength in a material whether or not the<br>
field reverses. Embodiments of the present invention achieve low core losses by<br>
preventing hysteresis in the bulk of the core and for this part of the core using a material<br>
resistant to eddy currents, such as powdered iron. Embodiments of the present invention<br>
further reduce core losses by using a material subject to low hysteresis losses in the small<br>
fraction of the core that does experience a reversal of magnetic field.<br>
The motor/alternator according to embodiments of the present invention uses a<br>
single magnet with a north pole and a south pole. The magnet optionally is a permanent<br>
magnet or an electromagnet or a combination of the two. A plurality of flux conductors<br>
direct the magnetic field of the single magnet. Half of the flux conductors are in contact<br>
with the north pole of the magnet so that they have positive polarity and half of the flux<br>
conductors are in contact with the south pole of the magnet so that they have negative<br>
polarity. The north and south flux conductors are separated from each other by an air gap<br>
that is sufficient to minimize flux leakage between the conductors. A plurality of switch<br><br>
devices are attached to a rotor. The switch devices make contact between the flux<br>
conductors to alternately open and close a magnetic circuit for conducting magnetic flux<br>
between the north and south poles of the device's magnet. These flux switches are the<br>
only part of the device undergoing hysteresis. The flux conductors are arranged so that<br>
they alternately conduct the magnetic flux in opposite directions around a power coil.<br>
Half of the flux conductors create a clockwise magnetic field around the power coil and<br>
the other half create a counter-clockwise magnetic field around the coil. As the switch<br>
devices open and close the alternating magnetic circuits, the polarity of the magnetic field<br>
surrounding the power coil is reversed. When used as an alternator, the reversal of the<br>
polarity of the magnetic field induces an alternating EMF voltage in the power coil. If an<br>
AC voltage is applied to the power coil, then the device will act as a motor by causing the<br>
switch devices on the rotor to move between flux conductors.<br>
The flux conductors can be very small so many pairs can fit within a small space<br>
before they become too close and magnetic leakage occurs. Since each pair of flux<br>
conductors consists of one pole in the motor/alternator, many times more poles are<br>
possible with embodiments of the present invention than with prior art motors and<br>
alternators. The high number of poles allows embodiments of the present invention to<br>
achieve the high electrical frequency required for a high power density while running at<br>
modest rotational speed.<br>
A device according to embodiments of the invention has the advantage that it uses<br>
only a single magnet. This allows for very simple and economical construction compared<br>
to many prior art motors and alternators. Embodiments of the present invention result in<br>
a motor or alternator with a large number of poles that does not require a large number of<br><br>
magnets. Furthermore since the magnet is on the stator there is no need for slip rings to<br>
bring electric current to the electromagnet, greatly simplifying its implementation. Since<br>
the magnet optionally is either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, there is great<br>
flexibility in selecting the magnet that works best for the desired use. One possibility is<br>
that the magnet is a hybrid permanent magnet, electromagnet combination. In this<br>
arrangement a permanent magnet provides a fixed strength magnetic field and an<br>
additional electromagnet is used to augment the field to strengthen it or potentially to<br>
reduce it. By adjusting the strength of the field from the electromagnet, the total field<br>
strength of the motor or alternator is optionally adjusted as necessary.<br>
An alternate embodiment of the present invention provides a three phase device.<br>
In its three phase embodiment still only one magnet or hybrid magnet is needed which<br>
magnetizes flux conductors which surround three separate coils arrayed one above<br>
another. Flux switches are arrayed such that a magnetic circuit is completed around one<br>
coil at a time. The flux switches are spaced such that three phase output is created when<br>
used as an alternator, and such that three phase power drives the device when used as a<br>
motor.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention have many possibilities in layout and<br>
geometry. The rotor optionally is on the inside or the outside of the stator, or even on<br>
the face. The flux switches and flux conductors optionally take a variety of shapes<br>
depending e.g. on the intended use. The magnet optionally is permanent, electric, or<br>
both. There are still more variations possible not described here but well within the scope<br>
of the invention.<br><br>
The motor/alternator according to embodiments of the present invention operates<br>
at very high electrical frequency for a given rotational speed compared to prior art<br>
devices. This results in very high power density. In one embodiment, the operating<br>
electrical frequency is ten times higher than prior art devices for a given rotational speed.<br>
This results in a power density that is ten times higher. The high frequency operation<br>
also results in decreased need for capacitors to smooth the power output when the device<br>
is used as an alternator. The high frequency operation further allows the device to<br>
operate at much higher voltage compared to prior art devices, thereby improving the<br>
battery charging capability of the device or simplifying its interface with an inverter. The<br>
higher voltage also results in smaller wires in the device, lower current, and lower power<br>
losses.<br>

embodiments will be apparent from the remainder of this disclosure.<br>

Detailed Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The present invention is shown and described in a number of different<br>
embodiments, and primarily in four specifically described embodiments. The first of the<br>
specifically described embodiments is a single phase device. The second is also a single<br>
phase device with different flux path geometry. The third describes a three phase version<br>
of the device. The fourth is a single phase version of the device with its rotor on the<br>
inside of the stator. There are other embodiments of this device beyond those most<br>
specifically described (such as a three phase device with the rotor on the inside) which<br>
although not explicitly described herein are implicit from or will be fully understood<br>
from these four embodiments.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, embodiments of the present invention include a stator 1<br>
that has a ring magnet 2, a set of north pole flux conductors 4, a set of south pole flux<br>
conductors 6, and a power coil 8. The north and south pole flux conductors 4 and 6 are in<br>
direct contact with the magnet 2. The flux conductors 4, 6 are made of a material that<br>
easily conducts a magnetic field. Ferrous materials work well, and one specific material<br><br>
is powdered metal although other materials optionally are used. The flux conductors 4<br>
and 6 direct the magnetic field of the magnet 2 toward the power coil 8. The power coil 8<br>
is an electrical coil in which electrical voltage is generated when the device is used as an<br>
alternator. When used as a motor, the power coil 8 provides voltage and current to power<br>
the device. The power coil 8 includes electrical leads 10 that collect the output power<br>
when the device is used as an alternator or provide power when it is used as a motor.<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded view of the ring magnet of Figure 1 in greater detail. One<br>
embodiment of the present invention is a hybrid magnet including a permanent magnet<br>
12 and an electromagnet 14 concentrically arranged, although embodiments of the<br>
invention optionally include only permanent magnet 12 singly or an electromagnet 14<br>
singly. In the configuration of the magnet 2 with only a permanent magnet 12, the<br>
electromagnet 14 is absent as are electrical leads 16 connected to the electromagnet 14.<br>
In a configuration of the magnet 2 with only an electromagnet 14, the permanent magnet<br>
12 is replaced by a cylinder of ferromagnetic material having the same shape as the<br>
permanent magnet to conduct the magnetic flux generated by the electromagnet 14. The<br>
magnetic field is then increased or decreased by adjusting the voltage applied to the<br>
electrical leads 16 of the electromagnet 14. In one configuration of the magnet 2 in<br>
which both a permanent magnet 12 and an electromagnet 14 are used as a hybrid magnet,<br>
the electromagnet 14 optionally adds to or subtracts from the magnetic field of the<br>
permanent magnet 12. This allows the field strength to be adjusted by the electromagnet<br>
14 when desired for start up, clutching, or braking, while also allowing the<br>
motor/alternator to run for the majority of the time without an outside current source<br>
using only the field generated by the permanent magnet 12.<br><br>
The flux conductors 4 that connect to the north pole of the magnet 2 are<br>
optionally formed as a single piece as shown in Figure 3. The flux conductors include a<br>
mounting ring 18 that provides a structural support for the flux conductor. Mounting ring<br>
18 contacts the north side of the magnet 2 (not shown) and retains the magnet 2 in its<br>
place. Attached to the mounting ring 18 are a plurality of flux conductor laminates 20.<br>
The laminates 20 conduct the magnetic field from the magnet 2 to the appropriate<br>
locations. Each laminate 20 extends radially outward from the mounting ring 18 and<br>
splits into two conducting portions.<br>
Figure 4 shows a single north flux conductor laminate 20. An upper conducting<br>
portion 22 extends directly radially outward from the mounting ring 18. A lower<br>
conducting portion 24 extends downwardly from the upper conducting portion 22. In<br>
between the upper and lower conducting portions 22, 24, there is a notch 26 defined<br>
within each laminate 20 to hold the power coil 8 (not shown). In addition to extending<br>
downwardly, each of the lower conducting portions 24 is bent so that the lower<br>
conducting portions 24 are not vertically aligned with the upper conducting portions 22.<br>
Each of the lower conducting portions 24 is circumferentially spaced to be halfway<br>
between two adjacent upper conducting portions 22. In one embodiment, the flux<br>
conductor 4 of Figure 3 includes sixty laminates 20 so that the rotational separation<br>
between two laminates 20 is six degrees. Since the lower conducting portion 24 is offset<br>
circumferentially from the upper conducting portion 22, the total offset between the two<br>
conducting portions 22 and 24 is three degrees. The flux conductor 4 is optionally cast as<br>
a single piece out of powdered metal. However, the flux conductor 4 optionally is<br><br>
fabricated so that the mounting ring 18 is a single piece and each laminate 20 is a<br>
separate piece that is securely attached to the mounting ring 18.<br>
Another set of flux conductors 6 is shown in Figure 5. The flux conductors 6 are<br>
magnetically connected to the south pole of the magnet 2 (not shown). Flux conductors 6<br>
are of similar construction to flux conductors 4 of Figure 3. Flux conductors 6 include a<br>
mounting ring 28 that connects to the south pole of the magnet 2. Laminates 30 project<br>
radially outwardly from the mounting ring 28.<br>
Figure 6 shows that a laminate 30 of flux conductor 6 is separated into an upper<br>
conducting portion 32 and a lower conducting portion 34 which extends radially from the<br>
mounting ring 28. There is a notch 36 defined between the upper conducting portion 32<br>
and lower conducting portion 34 to hold the power coil 8 (not shown). The upper<br>
conducting portions 32 are offset circumferentially relative to the lower conducting<br>
portions 34 so that the two sets of conducting portions 32 and 34 are staggered.<br>
Flux conductors 4 and 6 of Figure 1 are oriented relative to each other so that the<br>
laminates 20 of the north pole flux conductors 4 are interspersed with the laminates 30 of<br>
the south pole flux conductors 6 as shown in Figure 7. The laminates 20, 30 are spaced<br>
appropriately so that there will be little or no flux leakage through the air gap between<br>
adjacent laminates. A space of approximately 50 thousandths of an inch should be<br>
sufficient to minimize flux leakage. The upper and lower conducting portions 22 and 24<br>
of the north pole laminates 20 and the upper and lower conducting portions 32 and 34 of<br>
the south pole laminates 30 are staggered so that the upper conducting portion 22 of each<br>
north pole laminate 20 is vertically aligned with the lower conducting portion 34 of a<br>
south pole laminate 30. Similarly, the lower conducting portion 24 of each north pole<br><br>
laminate 20 is vertically aligned with the upper conducting portion 32 of a south pole<br>
laminate 30. Figure 7 shows an edge-on view of three of the north pole laminates 20 and<br>
three of the south pole laminates 30.<br>
The power coil 8 has electrical leads 10 which transmit the power generated or<br>
required by the motor/alternator, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Once the north flux conductors 4 and the south flux conductors 6 are assembled around<br>
the magnet 2 (referring to Figure 1), for example, the power coil is wound into the<br>
notches 26, 36. The power coil 8 is optionally wound from a copper foil that fits in the<br>
notch with a layer of insulation (not shown) between windings, or is made from<br>
windings of insulated rectangular wire. Alternately the power coil optionally is wound<br>
with normal round insulated wire but has a lower packing factor than with foil or<br>
rectangular wire. There optionally is a 'U' shaped track of insulating material (not<br>
shown), for example, laid down in the notch 26, 36 in which the power coil 8 is wound to<br>
generally prevent or reduce the likelihood of the power coil 8 shorting out on the flux<br>
conducting laminates 20, 30.<br>
Up to this point, the stator 1 of the motor/alternator has been described. In order<br>
to function as a motor or an alternator the device includes a rotor that provides input<br>
rotation and torque when used as an alternator and transmits rotation and torque when<br>
used as a motor. Figure 8 shows the rotor 37 of the motor/alternator. The rotor 37<br>
includes a rotor cup 38 mounted on a shaft 40 that rotates in bearings 42. The shaft 40 is<br>
driven by the device when it acts as a motor or it drives the device when it acts as an<br>
alternator, according to embodiments of the invention. Attached to the inside of the rotor<br><br>
cup 38 there are a plurality of flux switches 44, One embodiment includes sixty flux<br>
switches 44 attached to the inside of the rotor cup 38 at six degree intervals.<br>
Figure 9 shows a sectional side view of the motor/alternator according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Mounted to the rotor cup 38, there is a flux switch<br>
44 that rotates along with the rotor 37. The stator 1 includes a magnet 2 which provides a<br>
magnetic field with the north pole facing upward and the south pole facing downward.<br>
Flux conducting laminates 4 and 6 are in contact with the magnet 2. The flux conductors<br>
4 and 6 conduct the magnetic field from the magnet 2 very effectively so that essentially<br>
all of the magnetic flux from the magnet 2 is directed through the flux conductors 4 and<br>
6. The flux conductors 4 and 6 include notches 26 (not shown) and 36 in which the<br>
power coil 8 is mounted. The flux switch 44 contacts the flux conductors 4 and 6 to<br>
complete a magnetic circuit and conduct the magnetic flux from magnet 2. The magnetic<br>
circuit defined by flux conductors 4 and 6 and flux switch 44 encircles the power coil 8<br>
so that a change in the magnetic field passing within the circumference of the power coil<br>
8 induces an EMF voltage in the power coil and the device acts as an alternator.<br>
The method in which the magnetic field in flux conductors 4 and 6 and the flux<br>
switch 44 is varied to induce a voltage in the power coil 8 can better be understood with<br>
reference to Figures 10 and 11. Figure 10 shows a portion of the stator 1 together with<br>
the flux switch 44 when the rotor 37 is in a first position. In Figure 10, the flux switch 44<br>
contacts the upper conducting portion 22 of a north pole flux conductor laminate 20 and<br>
the lower conducting portion 34 of a south pole flux conductor laminate 30. The<br>
magnetic flux from the magnet 2 is directed radially outward through the north pole flux<br>
conductor laminate 20 through upper conducting portion 22, then downward through the<br><br>
flux switch 44, and finally radially inward through lower conducting portion 34 along<br>
the south pole flux conductor laminate 30 where the flux re-enters the south pole of the<br>
magnet 2. As the rotor 37 spins, the flux switch 44 passes by the flux conducting<br>
portions 22 and 34 and temporarily contacts the laminates 20 and 30 to form this circuit.<br>
Figure 11 shows a portion of the stator 1 together with the flux switch 44 in a<br>
configuration that occurs a moment after the configuration shown in Figure 10 (three<br>
degrees of rotation later in one embodiment). As the rotor 37 turns, the flux switch 44<br>
advances from one pair of flux conducting portions 22 and 34 to the next pair 24 and 32.<br>
In the configuration shown in Figure 11, the magnetic flux from magnet 2 is directed<br>
radially outward through the north pole flux conducting laminate 20. However, when the<br>
flux is part way out the laminate 20 it is directed downward through the lower conducting<br>
portion 24 of the laminate 20. The magnetic flux then enters the bottom of the flux<br>
switch 44 and is directed upward through the flux switch 44. At the top of the flux<br>
switch 44, the magnetic flux enters the upper conducting portion 32 of the south pole flux<br>
conducting laminate 30. The magnetic flux is then directed downward through the flux<br>
conducting laminate 30 and then it re-enters the south pole of the magnet 2. In the<br>
configuration shown in Figure 11, the flux follows a path that defines a "figure 8".<br>
The main difference between the configurations shown in Figure 10 and in Figure<br>
11 is the magnetic flux passing within the circumference of the power coil 8. In Figure<br>
10 the flux follows a path that moves in a clockwise direction around the power coil 8<br>
passing in the upward direction within the circumference of power coil 8 once. In<br>
contrast the configuration shown in Figure 11 causes the magnetic flux to follow a<br>
"figure 8" path around the power coil 8. The flux path travels upward through power<br><br>
coil 8 once near the center then travels downward through the interior then upward<br>
outside of the power coil's 8 circumference then downward again through the interior.<br>
The sum of magnetic flux in the position shown in Figure 11 is one pass of the flux in the<br>
upward direction minus two passes in the downward direction which is equivalent to one<br>
pass downward. In one embodiment, every three degrees of rotation the flux switch 44<br>
moves between pairs of laminates 20, 30 and the net magnetic flux passing within the<br>
circumference of the power coil 8 reverses and induces an AC voltage in the power coil<br>
8. The AC power generated in the power coil then optionally is reformed into DC power<br>
using standard techniques familiar to those skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure.<br>
If the device is operated as a motor, then an AC current is applied to the power<br>
coil 8 and a magnetic field encircling the power coil 8 passes through the flux switch 44.<br>
Referencing Figure 11, when the current is flowing out of the page through power coil 8,<br>
the induced magnetic field encircling power coil 8 is in the counter clockwise direction<br>
and thus the magnetic field in the flux switch 44 is in the upward direction reinforcing the<br>
magnetic flux present at that position. When the direction of current in the power coil 8<br>
reverses, the induced magnetic flux reverses now weakening the flux intensity at the<br>
position shown in Figure 11 but strengthening the flux intensity at the next position as<br>
shown in Figure 10. The flux switches are physically attracted to complete flux circuits,<br>
and the stronger the flux the stronger the attraction. Once the motor is spinning at a<br>
speed synchronous with the electronic frequency, the flux switches 44 are attracted<br>
strongly to a pair of flux conducting portions 24 and 32 or 22 and 34 as it approaches.<br>
Then, as it departs, that attraction weakens and attraction to the next pair 24 and 32 or 22<br>
and 34 strengthens. In this embodiment from a stationary state the direction of motor<br><br>
rotation is not determined since rotating clockwise and counter clockwise are equally<br>
likely. Once the motor is turning in a certain direction it will continue to go in that<br>
direction at exactly the frequency of the AC current in power coil 8. If the resistance<br>
torque on the motor reaches a critical threshold the motor will simply stall. In these ways<br>
embodiments of the present invention behave much like a synchronous motor.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are unlike a synchronous motor in that there are no<br>
repulsive forces since the flux switches 44 are not magnets. There is simply less and<br>
more attraction from one station to the next rather than a repulsion from one station and<br>
an attraction to the next.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention benefit from being potted (filled with<br>
epoxy) to maintain the dimensional stability between flux conductors 20,30 and flux<br>
switches 44. All of the components are solid state and durable, according to<br>
embodiments of the invention, and therefore will not need maintenance. Furthermore,<br>
the only motion is between the stator 1 and the rotor 37, so that in final assembly there<br>
need be only two components, a fully potted stator 1 and a fully potted rotor 37. Figure<br>
12 shows a potted stator 1 assembly and a potted rotor 37 assembly.<br>
The frequency of the voltage in the power coil 8 is the same as the frequency at<br>
which the magnetic field reverses. In the devices illustrated, there are sixty flux<br>
conducting laminates 20 connected to the north magnetic pole and sixty flux conducting<br>
laminates 30 connected to the south magnetic pole. Therefore, for every revolution of the<br>
rotor, the magnetic field reverses sixty times. This is equivalent to a sixty pole alternator,<br>
although the device is achieved with a single magnet and optionally is contained in a<br>
much smaller physical space than a prior art alternator with sixty poles. The device<br><br>
optionally is designed with a larger number of flux conducting laminates 20, 30 so that<br>
the number of poles is increased. One design consideration is that the laminates<br>
generally should be sufficiently spaced from one another to minimize flux leakage<br>
between the laminates. According to one embodiment, the laminates are spaced from<br>
each other by at least 0.050 inches to minimize flux leakage. Embodiments of the<br>
invention use sixty flux switches 44 arranged every six degrees around the rotor cup 38<br>
so that they all contact a similar pair of north and south pole laminates 20, 30<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The device shown and described has an output frequency equal to sixty times the<br>
rotational speed of the rotor. For a rotor speed of 100 RPM, the output frequency would<br>
be 6000 cycles per minute or 100 Hz. This is in comparison to a typical 6 pole alternator<br>
according to the prior art which would have an output frequency of 10 Hz for the same<br>
rotor speed. Due to the high electrical frequency at a given rotational speed, the device<br>
operates at a significantly higher voltage compared to prior art motors and alternators<br>
operating at the same rotational speed. The voltage is proportional to the rate of change<br>
of magnetic flux. Therefore, for a given magnetic field strength, the rate of change<br>
increases with frequency and voltage increases proportionally. This provides several<br>
advantages over typical prior art motors and alternators. First, the current flowing<br>
through the output coil is reduced by a factor of 10 due to the ten fold increase in voltage<br>
so that resistive losses in the coil are reduced by a factor of 100, since resistive losses are<br>
equal to current squared multiplied by resistance. Alternately, the device could have<br>
fewer turns of wire in the output coil compared to a typical prior art device and produce<br>
the same output voltage and current. By reducing the length (number of turns) of the<br><br>
wire by a factor often the cost of the coil is also reduced by a factor often as well as<br>
resistive losses being reduced by a factor often. The toroidal shape of the output coil<br>
optionally further reduces the impedance losses in the windings, thereby providing<br>
additional efficiency gains.<br>
The increase in frequency and voltage allows a very high power density for the<br>
device. The power density of the device according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention is approximately 10 times higher than that of a typical prior art six pole motor<br>
or alternator. In other words, for a given power rating the device optionally is packaged<br>
in a space only 1/10th that required for a typical prior art motor or alternator. This makes<br>
the device significantly more attractive for uses where space or weight are important.<br>
A prior art alternator possibly could be spun at a higher rotational speed to gain<br>
advantages related to those described in the above two paragraphs. However in prior art<br>
alternators core losses would make such a mode of operation inefficient. Significant<br>
reduction in core losses according to embodiments of the invention make higher electric<br>
frequency possible. Core losses are caused by hysteresis when the magnetic field<br>
reverses in a material, and electrical eddy currents induced in an electrically conducting<br>
material when the magnetic field varies within the material. Since the flux conductor 20,<br>
30 material does not experience hysteresis, the only losses are due to eddy currents<br>
caused by the increase then decrease (but never reversal) of magnetic flux. Thus a<br>
material like powdered iron works well for the flux conductors since eddy currents are<br>
very small in powdered iron as compared to other materials of equivalent permeability.<br>
Since the magnetic flux is only reversed in the flux switch 44, the hysteresis<br>
losses are only developed in a small portion of the magnetic path and so are greatly<br><br>
reduced. Because the flux switches 44 are so small, they optionally are optimized to<br>
minimize hysteresis and eddy current losses. The flux switches 44 optionally are made<br>
out of laminated steel to minimize loss. Due to their very small size, it optionally is<br>
economical to form the flux switches 44 out of met glass.<br>
The above improvements in efficiency along with the higher frequency of the<br>
motor/alternator according to embodiments of the present invention help create such a<br>
vast improvement over prior art motor/alternators. Prior art motor/alternators are not<br>
efficient at such high frequencies precisely because of the dramatic increase in core<br>
losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents. The motor/alternator according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention not only provides the geometry to fit many poles in<br>
a small space, thus allowing for high electrical frequencies at modest rotational speed, but<br>
also provides significant reduction in core losses to make a high frequency<br>
motor/alternator practical.<br>
Since the magnet 2 optionally is either a permanent magnet 12, an electromagnet<br>
14, or a combination of the two, it is possible to vary the field strength as desired. This<br>
allows the device to be used as an infinitely variable voltage controller. Increasing the<br>
magnetic field at slow rotation and decreasing the magnetic field at fast rotation keeps the<br>
voltage constant, thereby eliminating the need for a gearbox or other transmission to be<br>
used with the device. This has implications for many uses of the device. For instance,<br>
when used as a generator connected to a fly wheel, it optionally is operated as a direct<br>
drive generator and puts out a constant voltage without the need for a gearbox. Another<br>
use of the variable magnetic field is to do the opposite of the above and decrease the<br>
magnetic field during start up to make rotation easier, then increase the magnetic field as<br><br>
the turbine runs faster to act as a braking system; thus a constant speed, variable output<br>
wind generator is possible. This saves significant cost and maintenance problems for<br>
wind turbines.<br>
Since one embodiment of the motor/alternator of the present invention is in effect<br>
a sixty pole motor/alternator, cogging torque is reduced due to the even distribution of<br>
poles around the path of rotation. Instead of 6 poles in a conventional motor alternator<br>
creating six points in the path of rotation that must be mechanically overcome by external<br>
torque (as an alternator), there are sixty poles, thus sixty points in the rotation, with<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention smooth out<br>
the torque around a complete rotation with only small increases every 3 degrees instead<br>
of large increases in torque every 30 degrees as with a conventional six pole<br>
motor/alternator.<br>
The second specifically described embodiment of the invention further optimizes<br>
operation as an alternator by minimizing the amount of material undergoing hysteresis.<br>
Figure 13 shows a cross sectional view according to this embodiment, similar to the view<br>
shown in Figure 9 for the first embodiment. Many of the elements of the second<br>
embodiment are the same as in the first embodiment, such as the magnet 2, the power coil<br>
8, and the rotor cup 38. The second embodiment of the present invention makes use of a<br>
much deeper notch 50 in both north flux conductor laminates 52 and south flux conductor<br>
laminates 51 which contains the power coil 8 and a much smaller flux switch 54 now<br>
rotates within the notch 50. The north flux conductor laminate 52 has an elongated upper<br>
conducting portion 56 and elongated lower conducting portion 58. Although not shown in<br><br>
Figure 13 the south flux conductor 51 similarly has a longer upper conducting portion 60<br>
and lower conducting portion 62.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 show cross sectional views of two north flux conductor<br>
laminates 52, one south flux conductor laminate 51 and one flux switch 54. It can be<br>
seen in these figures that the flux conductor laminates 51, 52 are flat and there is no<br>
longer an offset between the upper conducting portion 56, 60 and lower conducting<br>
portion 58, 62 of the laminates 51, 52 as there is in the first embodiment. It can also be<br>
seen that the flux switch 54 is tilted at an angle such that it contacts one upper conducting<br>
portion 56, 60 of one polarity and an adjacent lower conducting portion 62, 58 of<br>
opposite polarity. In the second embodiment the flux conductors 51,52 and the flux<br>
switch 54 are flat shapes which will greatly ease manufacturing. Figures 14 and 15 show<br>
the sequence as the flux switch 54 rotates past the flux conducting laminates 51,52. In<br>
Figure 14 the flux switch is connecting a northern upper conducting portion 56 to the<br>
adjacent southern lower conducting portion 62. In Figure 15 a moment later the flux<br>
switch is connecting a southern upper conducting portion 60 with an adjacent northern<br>
lower conducting portion 58, thus the magnetic field reverses direction around the power<br>
coil 8 between Figures 14 and 15.<br>
One advantage of the second embodiment is the small flux switch 54. Since the<br>
flux switch 54 is the only part of this embodiment undergoing hysteresis, the smaller the<br>
flux switch the smaller the hysteresis losses will be. Furthermore with a small flux<br>
switch of simple shape it optionally is economical to build the flux switches out of exotic<br>
materials such as met glass, which experience extremely small hysteresis losses. The<br><br>
flux switch 54 may decrease in size up until the point that magnetic flux leakage between<br>
opposing flux conductors 51, 52 becomes a problem due to a very narrow notch 50.<br>
The third specifically described embodiment of the present invention is a three-<br>
phase motor/alternator. The three-phase embodiment described herein is optimized for<br>
low hysteresis losses and uses a similar flux conductor and flux switch layout as the<br>
single phase alternator described as the second specifically described embodiment of the<br>
invention. Other layouts for a three phase version are possible (such as one similar to the<br>
first embodiment specifically described herein, or one with an internal rotor) and are<br>
considered to be included within the scope the present invention.<br>
The three phase, third embodiment of the invention contains a stator 101 shown in<br>
Figure 16 and a rotor 160 shown in Figure 21. Figure 16 shows the components of the<br>
stator 101. The stator 101 has a ring magnet 102, a set of north pole flux conductors 104,<br>
a set of south pole flux conductors 106, and three power coils 108, 110, 112. The north<br>
and south pole flux conductors 104 and 106 are in direct contact with the magnet 102<br>
Similar to the previous embodiments the flux conductors are optionally made of a<br>
material that easily conducts a magnetic field and resists eddy currents, such as powdered<br>
iron. The flux conductors 104 and 106 direct the magnetic field of the magnet 102<br>
toward the power coils 108, 110, 112. The power coils 108, 110, 112 are electrical coils<br>
in which electrical voltage is generated when the device is used as an alternator. When<br>
used as a motor, the power coils 108, 110, 112 provide voltage and current to power the<br>
device. Each power coil 108, 110, 112 includes electrical leads 114, 115, 116<br>
respectively that collect the output power when the device is used as an alternator or<br>
provide power when it is used as a motor. Each power coil's 108, 110, 112 power wave<br><br>
form is 120 degrees out of phase with the other two. When combined, the outputs of the<br>
three power coils 108, 110, 112 produce three phase power. The magnet 102 in the three<br>
phase embodiment is similar in all respects to the magnet 2 (see Figure 2) in the single<br>
phase embodiment, including a permanent magnet, an electromagnet, or both in the form<br>
of a hybrid magnet.<br>
The flux conductors 104 that connect to the north pole of the magnet 102 (not<br>
shown) are optionally formed as a single piece as shown in Figure 17. The flux<br>
conductors include a mounting ring 118 that provides a structural support for the flux<br>
conductor. Mounting ring 118 contacts the north side of the magnet 102 and retains the<br>
magnet 102 in its place. Attached to the mounting ring 118 are a plurality of flux<br>
conductor laminates 120. The laminates 120 conduct the magnetic field from the magnet<br>
102 to the appropriate locations. Each laminate 120 extends radially outward from the<br>
mounting ring 118 and splits into four conducting portions.<br>
Figure 18 shows a single north flux conductor laminate 120. The laminate 120 is<br>
a flat piece having four conducting portions which are described here in descending order<br>
as shown in Figure 18. It should be noted that the words 'top', 'upper', 'lower', and<br>
'bottom' are used here for clarity in reference to how they appear in the figure. Such use<br>
of descriptive labels here and elsewhere in the description are intended to help clearly<br>
distinguish similar elements and in no way limit the present invention. A top<br>
conducting portion 124 extends directly radially outward from the mounting ring 118.<br>
An upper conducting portion 126 extends downwardly from the top conducting portion<br>
124. In between the top and upper conducting portions 124, 126, there is a notch 128<br>
defined within each laminate 120 to hold the power coil 108 (not shown). A lower<br><br>
conducting portion 130 extends downwardly from the upper conducting portion 126. In<br>
between the upper and lower conducting portions 126, 130, there is a notch 132 defined<br>
within each laminate 120 to hold the power coil 110 (not shown). A bottom conducting<br>
portion 134 extends downwardly from the lower conducting portion 130. In between the<br>
lower and bottom conducting portions 130, 134, there is a notch 136 defined within each<br>
laminate 120 to hold the power coil 112 (not shown). In one embodiment, the flux<br>
conductor 104 of Figure 17 includes sixty laminates 120 so that the separation between<br>
two laminates 120 is six degrees. The flux conductor 104 is optionally cast as a single<br>
piece out of powdered metal. However, the flux conductor 104 optionally is fabricated so<br>
that the mounting ring 118 is a single piece and each laminate 120 is a separate piece that<br>
is securely attached to the mounting ring 118.<br>
Another set of flux conductors 106 is shown in Figure 19. The flux conductors<br>
106 are magnetically connected to the south pole of the magnet 102. Flux conductors<br>
106 are of similar construction to flux conductors 104 of Figure 17 simply inverted. Flux<br>
conductors 106 include a mounting ring 138 that connects to the south pole of the magnet<br>
102. Laminates 140 project radially outwardly from the mounting ring 138.<br>
Figure 20 shows a single flux conducting laminate 140 of flux conductor 106.<br>
The laminate 140 is a flat piece and is separated into four conducting portions described<br>
in descending order as shown in Figure 20; a top conducting portion 144, an upper<br>
conducting portion 146, a lower conducting portion 150, and a bottom conducting portion<br>
154. The bottom conducting portion 154 extends directly radially outward from the<br>
mounting ring 138. Notches 148, 152, and 156 are defined between the conducting<br><br>
portions 144, 146, 150, 154 as shown and hold the power coils 108, 110, and 112 (not<br>
shown) respectively.<br>
Flux conductors 104 and 106 are oriented relative to each other so that the<br>
laminates 120 of the north pole flux conductors 104 are interspersed with the laminates<br>
140 of the south pole flux conductors 106. The laminates 120, 140 are spaced so that<br>
there will be little or no flux leakage through the air gap between adjacent laminates.<br>
Up to this point, only the stator 101 of the third specifically described<br>
embodiment motor/alternator has been discussed. Figure 21 shows the rotor 160 of the<br>
motor/alternator. The rotor 160 includes a rotor cup 162 mounted on a shaft 164 that<br>
rotates in bearings 166. The shaft 164 is driven by the device described herein when it<br>
acts as a motor or it drives the device described herein when it acts as an alternator,<br>
according to embodiments of the invention. Attached to the inside of the rotor cup 162<br>
there are a plurality of flux switches 168, 170, 172 arrayed into three circumferential<br>
rows one below the next which in descending order as shown in the Figure 21 will be<br>
called a high row of flux switches 168, a middle row of flux switches 170, and a low row<br>
of flux switches 172. It should be noted that the words 'high', 'middle', and 'low' are<br>
used here for clarity in reference to how they appear in the figure. Such use of<br>
descriptive labels here and elsewhere in the description are intended to help clearly<br>
distinguish similar elements and in no way limit the present invention. One<br>
embodiment includes sixty flux switches 168, 170, 172 in each row attached to the inside<br>
of the rotor cup 162 at six degree intervals. Each row is rotationally offset from the other<br>
two by 2 degrees. The flux switches 168, 170, 172 are installed through slots (not<br>
shown) in the rotor cup 162 after rotor 160 is placed over the assembled stator 101. The<br><br>
high flux switches 168 rotate through the notches 128, 148 in the flux conducting<br>
laminates 120, 140. The middle flux switches 170 rotate through the notches 132, 152,<br>
and the low flux switches 172 rotate through notches 136, 156 in flux conducting<br>
laminates 120, 140. The operation of the flux switches 168, 170, 172 in conducting flux<br>
between north flux conducting laminates 120 and south flux conducting laminates 140<br>
produces three phase power as will be more clearly shown in Figures 22, 23, 24, and 25<br>
Figures 22, 23, 24, and 25 show a sequence as one set of three flux switches, a<br>
high flux switch 168, a middle flux switch 170, and a low flux switch 172 rotate through<br>
three degrees of arc, or one half cycle. The rotation in this series of figures is in the<br>
clockwise direction as seen from above. Shown are the power coils 108, 110, and 112,<br>
two north flux conducting laminates 120, having top 124, upper 126, lower 130, and<br>
bottom 134, conducting portions, and two south flux conducting laminates 140, having<br>
top 144, upper 146, lower 150, and bottom 154, conducting portions. In each figure only<br>
the conducting portions mentioned in the figure's description are labeled. Arrows on the<br>
flux switch 168, 170, or 172 and on the flux conductors 120, 140 indicate position and<br>
direction of peak magnetic flux flow. An arrow on a power coil 108, 110, or 112<br>
indicates direction of peak electric current flow. For the purpose of this explanation<br>
current is defined as positive when flowing to the right as shown and negative when<br>
flowing to the left as shown.<br>
In Figure 22 high flux conductor 168 is magnetically connecting a top conducting<br>
portion 144 of a south flux laminate 140 to an upper conducting potion 126 of a north<br>
flux laminate 120 causing flux to rotate around power coil 108 in a counter clockwise<br>
direction inducing electric current to flow in power coil 108 to the left or negative<br><br>
direction. Depending on the details of construction of the flux conducting laminates 120,<br>
140 and flux switches 168, 170, 172 there optionally also is some small amount of<br>
current flow induced in the two power coils 108, 110, 112 not mentioned (in this figure<br>
coils 110 and 112) and such would be the case if standard three phase power output were<br>
desired. For the purpose of this explanation, only the peak current and flux are illustrated<br>
and discussed.<br>
Figure 23 is the same view as Figure 22 one degree of rotation later. The middle<br>
flux switch 170 is magnetically connecting an upper conducting portion 126 of a north<br>
flux laminate 120 to a lower conducting potion 150 of a south flux laminate 140 causing<br>
flux to rotate around power coil 110 in a clockwise direction inducing electric current to<br>
flow in power coil 110 to the right or positive direction.<br>
Figure 24 is the same view as Figure 22 two degrees of rotation later. The low<br>
flux conductor 172 is magnetically connecting a lower conducting portion 150 of a south<br>
flux laminate 140 to a bottom conducting potion 134 of a north flux laminate 120 causing<br>
flux to rotate around power coil 112 in a counter clockwise direction inducing electric<br>
current to flow in power coil 112 to the left or negative direction<br>
Figure 25 is the same view as Figure 22 three degrees of rotation later. The high<br>
flux conductor 168 is magnetically connecting a top conducting portion 124 of a north<br>
flux laminate 120 to an upper conducting potion 146 of a south flux laminate 140 causing<br>
flux to rotate around power coil 108 in a clockwise direction inducing electric current to<br>
flow in power coil 108 to the right or positive direction, which is the opposite of Figure<br>
22. Thus the current flow has been reversed in power coil 108 completing the half cycle<br>
over three degrees of rotation.<br><br>
Three-phase embodiments of the invention have the advantage of directionality,<br>
i.e. there is a forward and a backward. In single-phase embodiments the direction of<br>
rotation is undetermined when used as a motor, but with three phase embodiments there<br>
is a clear path of rotation (clockwise in the embodiment shown in figures 23-26). With<br>
proper controls, the direction of rotation optionally is reversed by switching the relative<br>
phase of power supplied to any two of the power coils 108, 110, 112. Furthermore it<br>
should be noted that in the third specifically described embodiment of the present<br>
invention the motor/alternator has sixty poles, and three phases, but still uses only one<br>
magnet.<br>
A benefit according to embodiments of the invention is the low inertia of the<br>
rotor. Since only the flux switches turn, they optionally are made very lightweight for<br>
uses in which rotor inertia is a critical issue. To further reduce the rotor's inertia, it is<br>
possible to reverse the configuration of the device so that the magnet is on the outside of<br>
the stator and the power coil is on the inside. This allows the flux switch to be located on<br>
the inside of the rotor where it will have a lower moment of inertia and the rotor will be<br>

A single-phase internal rotor variation of the device is described as the fourth<br>
specifically described embodiment of the invention. While a single-phase device is<br>
described in the fourth embodiment it is to be understood that the interior rotor<br>
configuration could be used equally well with a three-phase device. Figure 26 shows an<br>
exploded view of the stator 201 of the fourth embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
stator 201 has a ring magnet 202, a set of north pole flux conductors 204, a set of south<br>
pole flux conductors 206, and a power coil 208 similar to the other embodiments. The<br><br>
flux conductors 204 and 206 direct the magnetic field of the magnet 202 on the outside<br>
toward the power coil 208 on the inside.<br>
The flux conductors 204 and 206 are optionally formed as a single piece as in the<br>
other three embodiments. The flux conductors 204, 206 include a mounting ring 218,<br>
228 that provides a structural support for the flux conductor 204, 206 and hold the<br>
magnet 202 in place. Attached to the mounting rings 218, 228 are a plurality of flux<br>
conductor laminates 220, 230 respectively. The laminates 220, 230 conduct the magnetic<br>
field from the magnet 202 to the appropriate locations.<br>
Flux conductors 204 and 206 are oriented relative to each other so that the<br>
laminates 220 of the north pole flux conductors 204 are interspersed with the laminates<br>
230 of the south pole flux conductors 206. The laminates 220,230 are spaced<br>
appropriately so that there will be little or no flux leakage through the air gap between<br>
adjacent laminates.<br>
Figure 27 shows the rotor 237 of the fourth embodiment motor/alternator of the<br>
present invention. The rotor 237 includes a rotor shaft 240 that rotates in bearings 242.<br>
The shaft 240 is driven by the device of the present invention in its various embodiments<br>
when it acts as a motor or it drives the device of the present invention in its various<br>
embodiments when it acts as an alternator. Mounted to the outside of the shaft 240 is a<br>
plurality of flux switches 244. One embodiment includes sixty flux switches 244 attached<br>
to the shaft 240 at six degree intervals. Each flux switch 244 has a double bend in its<br>
midsection such that it connects an upper conducting potion 222, 232 with an adjacent<br>
lower conducting portion 234, 224 of opposite polarity.<br><br>
Figure 28 shows a cut away view of the fourth specifically described<br>
embodiment of the present invention where a flux switch 244 and two north flux<br>
conducting laminates 220 and two south flux conducting laminates 230 are shown. Each<br>
laminate 220, 230 splits into two conducting portions. Thus a north laminate 220 has an<br>
upper conducting portion 222 and a lower conducting portion 224 with a notch 226<br>
defined between them and a south laminate 230 has an upper conducting portion 232 and<br>
a lower conducting portion 234 with a notch 236 defined between them. The flux switch<br>
244 is connecting the upper conducting portion 222 of a north flux conducting laminate<br>
220 with a lower conducting portion 234 of a south flux conducting laminate.<br>
Figure 29 shows a sectional side view of the fourth embodiment motor/alternator<br>
of the present invention, similar to the views shown in Figure 9 for the first embodiment<br>
and Figure 13 for the second embodiment. Mounted to the rotor shaft 240, there is a flux<br>
switch 244 that rotates along with the shaft 240. The stator includes a magnet 202 which<br>
provides a magnetic field with the north pole facing upward and the south pole facing<br>
downward. Flux conductors 204 and 206 are in contact with the magnet 202. The flux<br>
conductors 204 and 206 include notches 226 and 236 in which the power coil 208 is<br>
mounted. The flux switch 244 contacts the flux conductors 204 and 206 to complete a<br>
magnetic circuit and conduct the magnetic flux from magnet 202.<br>
The fourth embodiment shows a different geometry (rotor 237 on the inside,<br>
stator 201 on the outside, double bend in the flux switch 244) from the previous<br>
embodiments of the present invention. This newly described geometry helps to decrease<br>
the inertia of the rotor. There are other geometries that are possible and still well within<br>
the scope of the present invention and these alternate geometries may provide some<br><br>
advantage. For example a layout in which the stator and rotor both terminate in flat disks<br>
which abut each other is possible and optionally is desirable for ease of construction, or<br>
for generating power across a membrane. Thus the rotor is not on the inside or the<br>
outside of the stator but on the face of the stator. Another potential form is as a linear<br>
motor/alternator where flux conductors are arrayed in a straight line and flux switches are<br>
attached to a reciprocating shaft. Such a linear alternator would be useful in use with a<br>
Stirling motor, for example. It is intended that the above and other geometries and<br>
variations in layout that produce the same or similar electromagnetic effect be included in<br>
the scope of the present invention. The specifically described embodiments illustrate<br>
some of the variations that the present invention may embody but are in no way intended<br>
to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
It should be noted that one difference between embodiments of the present<br>
invention and prior art motors and alternators is basic orientation of magnetic fields and<br>
motion. In prior art motors and alternators the axis of rotation, the orientation of the<br>
magnetic field, and the line of relative motion between the stator and rotor, are all<br>
perpendicular to each other. In embodiments of the present invention the orientation of<br>
the magnetic field and the axis of rotation are parallel and each perpendicular to the line<br>
of relative motion between the rotor and the stator. This difference optionally allows<br>
embodiments of the present invention to be used where prior art motors and alternators<br>
are impractical, such as generating or transmitting power across a membrane as<br>
mentioned above.<br>
The electrical machine of the present invention, in the specifically described<br>
embodiments above, consists of several components. The components include a magnet<br><br>
(element 2 in Figure 1 for example), an electrical conductor arranged to form a loop<br>
(element 8 in Figure 1 for example), a plurality of flux conductors (elements 4 and 6 in<br>
Figure 1 for example) which direct magnetic flux from the magnet through the electrical<br>
conductor, wherein a first set of flux conductors (element 4 in Figure 1 for example)<br>
directs magnetic flux through the electrical conductor in a first direction and a second set<br>
of flux conductors (element 6 in Figure 1 for example) directs magnetic flux through the<br>
electrical conductor in a second direction, and a switch (element 44 in Figure 8 for<br>
example) for alternately connecting and disconnecting the first and second sets of flux<br>
conductors. The switch may optionally be attached to a rotor of the electrical machine<br>
and motive force may optionally be applied to the rotor to induce electrical current to<br>
flow in the electrical conductor, or alternating electrical current may optionally be<br>
applied to the electrical conductor to impart motion to the rotor. It should be noted that<br>
the loop of electrical conductor and the magnet are optionally annular in shape although<br>
they may take different shapes or forms. The magnet and the electrical conductor may<br>
optionally be concentrically oriented, although other orientations may be possible. If the<br>
magnet and electrical conductor are annular and they are concentrically oriented, the<br>
magnet may optionally have a smaller diameter than the electrical conductor and may<br>
optionally be arranged inside the periphery of the electrical conductor or the electrical<br>
conductor may optionally have a smaller diameter than the magnet and may optionally be<br>
arranged inside the periphery of the magnet. The flux conductors may optionally be<br>
formed from powdered iron, although other materials may also work well. The switch<br>
may optionally be formed from laminated steel or met glass, although other materials<br>
may also work well for the switch. The electrical machine of the present invention may<br><br>
optionally include three electrical conductors each arranged to form a loop, wherein the<br>
flux conductors direct magnetic flux from the magnet through the loops of all three<br>
electrical conductors. In this case, the electrical machine would include switches for<br>
alternately connecting and disconnecting the flux conductors through all three electrical<br>
conductors such that the electrical machine operates as a three phase machine. The<br>
magnet that is used in the electrical machine of the present invention may optionally be<br>
either a permanent magnet, an electromagnet, or a hybrid that includes a permanent<br>
magnet and an electromagnet in juxtaposition such that the magnetic fields of the<br>
permanent magnet and the electromagnet are additive.<br>
While embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made in these<br>
embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. Therefore, it is intended<br>
that the invention not necessarily be limited to the particular embodiments described and<br>
illustrated herein.<br><br>
