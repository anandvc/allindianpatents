				<td>ROTATING ELECTRIC MACHINE APPARATUS AND METHOD OF<br>
ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to rotating electric machines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Assembly of rotor assemblies within stator assemblies associated<br>
with a motor requires tooling precision to align rotor and stator units.<br>
[0003] Motor assembly is accomplished using precision fixturing to center<br>
and align a heavily magnetized rotor unit into a ferrous stator unit. The rotor<br>
unit is a cylindrical magnetized component and the stator unit is an iron based<br>
"tube" that closely matches the rotor unit in diameter and length. Inserting the<br>
rotor unit into the stator unit is complicated by the fact that the rotor<br>
magnetically pulls itself toward the stator unit and adheres magnetically<br>
thereto. Even in the absence of magnetized components, the desirably<br>
minimal air gap between the stator and rotor leaves little tolerance for<br>
assembly error.<br>
[0004] When the rotor unit contacts the stator unit, damage to both units<br>
can occur and unwanted debris may be generated by the scraping of the rotor<br>
unit against the stator unit, thereby inhibiting operation of the motor.<br><br>
[0005] What is needed is a motor apparatus that is robust and tolerant of<br>
the assembly process and a method for assembly of a motor that avoids<br>
damage occasioned by interference of the rotor and stator during assembly.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A rotating electric machine apparatus includes concentric rotor and<br>
stator assemblies including an end plate that cooperates during assembly of the<br>
motor apparatus to prevent undesirable contact between the rotor assembly<br>
and the stator assembly.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
[0008] FIG. 1 illustrates a cross sectional view of a rotor assembly having<br>
associated end plates with assembly guide rings assembled in combination<br>
with a stator assembly in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0009] FIG. 2 illustrates a partial perspective sectional view of the rotor<br>
assembly and stator assembly combination shown in FIG. 1;<br>
[0010] FIG. 3 illustrates a partial perspective enlarged view of the rotor of<br>
FIG. 2 disposed between the assembly guide rings; and<br>
[0011] FIG. 4 illustrates a partial perspective view of the rotor assembly<br>
and stator assembly combination of FIG. 1 before the rotor assembly is<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] The present disclosure relates to preventing undesirable contact<br>
between a rotor assembly and a stator assembly associated with a motor<br>
apparatus during assembly of the motor. The embodiments described help<br>
prevent the scraping of the rotor and stator against each other that may<br>
produce undesirable debris. While reference is made to motors herein, the<br>
present disclosure is equally applicable to any rotating electric machines<br>
including electric generators.<br>
[0013] A motor apparatus in accordance with the present disclosure<br>
includes at least one end plate associated with the rotor assembly that allow<br>
easy assembly of the rotor assembly within the stator assembly, particularly<br>
when using manual assembly tooling. The ease of assembly may reduce<br>
assembly costs and the time required to assemble the electric machine.<br>
[0014] The embodiments of the present disclosure may be used with any<br>
magnetic or non-magnetic motor. Additionally, the motor used may either<br>
have a rotor that is adapted to fit inside a stator, or alternatively, a motor that<br>
has a stator adapted to fit inside a rotor. While the embodiments of the present<br>
disclosure may be used with either rotor-stator combination, the specific<br>
embodiments shown in the Figures illustrates a motor having a rotor adapted<br>
to fit within a stator. In an embodiment, the motor is an electric motor for use<br>
in a hybrid vehicle.<br>
[0015] End plates may be formed by any non-magnetic material capable of<br>
maintaining a rigid structure during assembly of the rotor unit within the stator<br><br>
unit. Preferably, the non-magnetic material is of a hardness and quality that<br>
will not subject portions of the motor apparatus foreseeably contacted thereby<br>
during the motor apparatus assembly process to damage as will become more<br>
apparent in conjunction with the description which follows herein below.<br>
[0016] Referring now to the drawings, shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 4 is a<br>
combination rotor and stator assembly 8 including a rotor assembly 10 and a<br>
stator assembly 34.<br>
[0017] The rotor assembly 10 includes a rotor hub 12 having an outer<br>
surface 54 adapted to receive a rotor unit and including a protruding tab 42<br>
adapted to retain the rotor assembly 10 within the stator assembly 34 when<br>
assembled with the stator assembly 34; a roller bearing 14; a shield 16<br>
disposed between the rotor hub 12 and the roller bearing 14; a cylindrical rotor<br>
unit 18 including first and second opposing ends 24, 26, the rotor unit 18<br>
having an inner cylindrical peripheral wall 62 seated on the outer surface 54 of<br>
the rotor hub 12, and an outer cylindrical peripheral wall 64; and a first and a<br>
second assembly guide ring 20, 22, that each respectively define an associated<br>
one of the pair of end plates, wherein the first and second assembly guide<br>
rings are respectively each fitted onto the opposing ends 24, 26 of the rotor<br>
unit 18.<br>
[0018] In one embodiment, at least one end plate may be used, however,<br>
as described with reference to the specific embodiments illustrated in the<br>
figures, two end plates are used. As defined herein, the terms end plates and<br>
guide rings are used interchangeably.<br><br>
[0019] FIG. 3 is a partial perspective view of the two annular non-<br>
magnetic end plate guide rings 20,22 assembled in combination with the rotor<br>
unit 18.<br>
[0020] In one embodiment, the guide rings 20, 22 are co-centrically<br>
disposed at the opposing ends 24, 26 of the rotor unit 18 and are uniform in<br>
shape. Each assembly guide ring 20, 22 provides guidance for the rotor unit<br>
18 as it is being assembled into the stator unit 36. The rotor is slidably<br>
assembled into the stator with the leading end of the rotor having a guide ring<br>
affixed thereto. During assembly, the leading guide ring prevents undesirable<br>
contact of the rotor unit 18 with the stator unit 36. The trailing guide ring may<br>
provide additional guidance and relative co-centric alignment of the opposite<br>
end of the rotor and the stator unit 36. Generally it is preferable that the outer<br>
diameter of the guide rings are no larger than the inner diameter of the stator<br>
unit though, depending upon the material used, some interference may be<br>
acceptable. More preferable, however, the outer diameter of the guide rings<br>
are no grater than and even more preferably slightly less than the inner<br>
diameter of the stator unit.<br>
[0021] Generally the end plates 20, 22 are composed of a material that is<br>
not the same hardness as the stator unit 36. The plates 20, 22 provide ease of<br>
sliding the rotor unit 18 with guide protrusions 28, 30 into the stator unit 36<br>
without damage to the stator unit 36.<br>
[0022] In an embodiment, shown in FIG. 3, the guide rings may have<br>
variations in thickness thereby forming a gap or oil groove 32 between a<br><br>
portion of at least one of the guide rings and the outer surface 54 of the rotor<br>
hub 12, wherein the groove 32 allows for oil to flow to the hub 12.<br>
[0023] In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, the first ring 20 abutting<br>
the first rotor end 24 has a first portion 58 having a thickness Tl and a second<br>
portion 60 having a thickness T2 slightly smaller than the thickness Tl, such<br>
that the difference in thickness between the two portions defines the oil groove<br>
32. The first portion 58 has an arcuate protuberance 28 formed radially<br>
outwardly from a first ring outer peripheral wall 66, wherein the protuberance<br>
28 of the first ring outer peripheral wall 66 has a diameter slightly larger than<br>
the diameter of the rotor cylindrical outer peripheral wall 64, thereby forming<br>
a uniform spacer between an inner peripheral wall of the stator and the outer<br>
peripheral wall 64 of the rotor unit 18 when the rotor assembly 10 is<br>
assembled within the stator assembly 34. The arcuate protuberance may be<br>
circumferentially continuous of discontinuous. For example, in the illustrated<br>
embodiments the protuberance is continuous along the entire circumference of<br>
the guide ring. However, guide rings may include discrete individual,<br>
preferably circumferentially equidistantly spaced arcuate protuberances. Such<br>
latter embodiment may resemble a guide ring having a castellated outer<br>
periphery.<br>
[0024] In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, the second ring 22<br>
abutting the second rotor end 26 has a uniform thickness T3. The second ring<br>
22 has an arcuate protuberance 30 formed radially outwardly from a second<br>
ring outer peripheral wall 68, wherein the protuberance 30 of the second ring<br>
outer peripheral wall 68 has a diameter equal to the diameter of the first ring<br><br>
protuberance 28, and is thus slightly larger than the diameter of the rotor<br>
cylindrical outer peripheral wall 64, thereby forming a uniform spacer<br>
between an inner peripheral wall of the stator and the outer peripheral wall 64<br>
of the rotor unit 18 when the rotor assembly 10 is assembled within the stator<br>
assembly 34.<br>
[0025] The arcuate protrusions 28, 30 each operate to reduce the potential<br>
for damage to the motor windings during assembly of the rotor unit 18 to the<br>
stator unit 36 by preventing a conventional sharp or chamfered corner on the<br>
rotor unit 18 from scraping the stator unit 36.<br>
[0026] The distance between the opposing ends of the rotor is slightly<br>
larger than the distance between respective opposing ends of the stator, and<br>
thus, once assembled together, the end plates 20, 22 are no longer needed to<br>
separate the rotor unit 18 from the stator unit 34.<br>
[0027] When the rotor unit 18 is assembled within the stator unit 36, the<br>
assembly guide ring protrusions 28, 30 do not interfere with the function of the<br>
motor and may be allowed to remain within the motor for the life of the motor<br>
assembly.<br>
[0028] The stator assembly 34 is adapted to co-centrically receive the rotor<br>
assembly 10. The stator assembly 34 includes the stator unit 36 having two<br>
opposing ends 70, 72, an inner cylindrical wall 48 having a diameter greater<br>
than an outer diameter of the rotor assembly 10, a stator housing 38, a plurality<br>
of stator teeth 52, a plurality of windings 50, and a connection ring 40.<br>
[0029] In an embodiment, the rotor unit 18 is magnetized and the stator<br>
unit 36 is formed of a ferrous material.<br><br>
[0030] During assembly of the rotor assembly 10, the guide rings 20, 22<br>
may be shrink-fit or pressed onto respective rotor opposing edges 24, 26 of the<br>
rotor unit 18. However, any suitable means of affixing the guide rings 20, 22<br>
with the rotor opposing edges 24, 26 may be used that has come or may come<br>
into existence. The rotor unit 18 is then pressed onto the rotor hub 12. The<br>
roller bearing 14 is pressed onto the rotor hub 12, thereby integrally forming<br>
the rotor assembly 10.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment, before the rotor unit 18 is assembled within<br>
the stator unit 36, the protruding tab 42 integrally formed with the rotor hub 14<br>
is staked across a portion of the second guide ring 22 to retain the second<br>
guide ring 22 in place with respect to the rotor assembly 10.<br>
[0032] The protuberances 28, 30 each respectively associated with the first<br>
and second guide rings 20, 22 operate to keep the magnetic rotor unit 18 from<br>
contacting the interior ferrous wall of the stator unit 36. Thus, the rotor unit<br>
18 slidably assembles within the stator assembly 34 and does not contact the<br>
inner cylindrical wall 48 of the stator unit 36.<br>
[0033] Additionally, the guide rings may be used as sacrificial mass<br>
whereby material removal provides a means of balancing the rotor.<br>
[0034] It is understood that modifications are allowable within the scope<br>
of the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>
