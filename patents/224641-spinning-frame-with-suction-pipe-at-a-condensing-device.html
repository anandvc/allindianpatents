The disclosure of these co-pending applications are incorporated herein by cross-reference.<br>
The invention is being applied in a spinning frame as is for instance being described in the German patent application DE 44 26 249.3. The content of this application is in so far considered a part of the present disclosure as it promotes its understanding.<br><br>
Spinning frames with condensing devices allow the production of high quality yams. It is therefore necessary to optimally lay out all elements being involved in the spinning process. Amongst other facts the task is given to provide a suction pipe which on one hand removes fibre fly without a tendency of contamination and on the other hand to safely catch the free end of the sliver during a thread break.<br>
This task is being solved by a suction pipe with the characteristics as described herein.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning frame with a suction pipe a spinning frame with a suction pipe, at a condensing device, whereat the condensing device is being arranged at the outlet side of a drafting unit and whereat the suction pipe is being arranged at the downstream side close to a clamping gap between a clamping roller and a condensing element and at a thread, which is being led off the condensing device, characterised in that the suction pipe at its end, which is directed towards the clamping gap and which is being arranged between the outer surface of a roller and a plane within which several threads lay next to each other, is being provided with at least one opening whereat said opening as seen in relation to the axis of the suction pipe is being displaced in axial direction of the roller or the clamping roller respectively, and whereat the opening is directed to the thread which is being guided at a close distance in relation to the suction pipe.<br><br>
The invention is being described in detail by way of examples of the accompanying drawing, wherein show:<br>
Figure 1        schematically the position of the suction pipe in relation to the condensing device of the spinning frame.<br>
Figure 2        a side view of the suction pipe basically at right angle towards the running direction of the threads below the condensing device, seen from the left side in figure 1.<br>
Figure 3       a perspective view onto the pipe end with the threads besides it, whereat the rib has been left out.<br>
Figure 4       a longitudinal cross section through the suction pipe, with a rib arranged on its upper side in the right hand part of the figure and a side view of the suction pipe as seen from the right side, in the left hand part of the figure and<br>
Figure 5       a bottom view B onto the pipe according to arrow B in figure 4 and a cross section C-C according to the section line in view B.<br>
From a not further shown supply means a sliver or roving 18 is being led into a drafting unit 8 of which only one pair of rollers is being shown. An outlet roller 14 together with a condensing element 12, which is being provided with a rotation axis, is to be considered as a part of the drafting unit 8, on the other hand the latter belongs to the condensing device 10, whereat the condensing element 12 is preferably designed as a perforated fixed drum being suctioned from the inside. After leaving the drafting zone in the drafting unit 8, between the outlet roller 14 and the condensing element 12, the roving 18 partially runs over the outer circumferential surface of the condensing element 12, up to about the clamping gap between a clamping roller 16 and the condensing element 12.<br><br>
Within the clamping gap or slightly afterwards the roving 18 or the twisting thread 20 respectively, is being drawn off from the condensing element and is wound in a twisting and winding unit onto a sleeve. According to the invention the suction pipe 22 is preferably an open-ended tapered pipe narrowing towards the clamping gap between the clamping roller 16 and the condensing element 12, and which is furnished with a rib 24 being positioned symmetrically at a right angle towards the rotational axis. Preferably and according to figure 2 two threads 20 are led next to each other on a condensing element 12, whereat the suction pipe 22 is being positioned between these two threads. As can be seen from figure 1, the suction pipe 22 is being positioned between the outer circumferential surface of the condensing element 12 and a plane within which several threads 20 are being led next to each other in the axial direction of the condensing element 12. The actual suction opening 28 of the suction pipe 22 is positioned laterally offset in axial direction of the condensing element 12 or the clamping roller 16 respectively, besides the thread 20 but as close as possible to it, since during a thread break the fibre material has to be removed towards the inside of the suction pipe 22. With double guidance of the threads 20 as indicated in figure 2 there is one suction opening 28 and 26 respectively each being located at the outer side of the suction pipe 22 next to the thread 20, whose openings are inclined at an angle of 40° - 70°, preferably 50°, in relation to a symmetrical plane 30 laid through the suction pipe and being at a right angle to the axis of the condensing element 12. Furthermore, as is shown in figure 2, the suction opening 26 or 28 respectively, is directed away from the condensing element 12 i.e. in the drawn plane slantedly downwards against the thread 20. Between two openings 26 and 28 there is a further slot-shaped opening 27 directed transverse to the rib 24 which is considerably smaller than the openings 26 or 28 respectively. The openings 26 and 28 are basically oval while the connecting opening 27 basically is of rectangular shape. The openings 26, 27, 28 thus resemble the form of eye-glasses whereat said 'glasses' are directed towards the portions of the threads 20 next to them and whereat past the symmetrical plane 30, which is at an angle to the axis of the condensing element 12 or the clamping roller 16 respectively, said 'glasses' are being connected by the slot-shaped opening 27. Together with a rib 24 being attached<br><br>
on the right side or below respectively, and which lays positioned in the symmetrical plane 30, the connecting opening serves the purpose that possible inter-connected fibres from one thread 20 to another, according to figure 2, at first are being caught on the rounded end part of the rib 24 and then are being led downwards into the connecting opening 27. The rib 27 which ends above the suction opening 28 or 26 respectively, i.e. closer to the clamping gap between the clamping roller 16 and the condensing element 20, further has the effect of a separator between the threads 20. As mentioned above the suction pipe 22 can be provided as a pipe with only one opening for a single-thread embodiment of the condensing device 10, whereat said opening on the pipe 22 is being positioned within the wedge-shaped space between the condensing element 12 and the thread 20, in axial direction of the condensing element 12, offset on the outer wall and at the same time at the end of the tapered pipe 22. In this case the symmetrical plane 30 would be a side wall of the suction pipe 22. As mentioned the pipe is to be arranged as close as possible at the clamping gap between the clamping roller 16 and the condensing element 12, whereat a distance of between 15 and 25, preferably 20 mm is to be maintained between the pipe end and the clamping gap.<br>
Due to the arrangement of the suction pipe 22 as close as possible to the outer surface of the condensing element the perforations of said condensing element are also being suctioned effectively and thus kept free of contamination.<br>
It is understood that a plurality of suction pipes 22 within a spinning frame is being connected to one suction installation.<br>
Figure 3 shows the suction pipe end 22 perspectively, in viewing direction slantedly from the top downward according to the arrow in figure 1, however without rib 24. The lateral and slantedly arranged openings point downwards so that the incoming air stream contacts the threads 20 as is indicated by the arrows.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a longitudinal cross section and side view onto the tapered end of the suction pipe 22. While the free longitudinal edge of the rib 24 basically runs parallel to the axis of the pipe, the head edge of the rib includes with the pipe axis or the free edge respectively, an angle of approximately 50°, whereat said angle may vary between 40' and 60°.<br>
Figure 5 shows in the lower half, a bottom view B onto the suction pipe 22 being shown in longitudinal cross section in the figure and a section according to the line C-C through the pipe head part, whereat said section is basically laid transverse to the longitudinal extension of a suction opening 28. The suction openings 26 and 28 are basically of elliptical shape, whereat the larger symmetrical axis of the ellipse together with the symmetrical plane 30 includes an angle of 40° to 60°, in particular 50° and whereat the smaller axis of the ellipse in the drawing plane of the section C-C together with the normal on the pipe axis includes an angle of 0° to 50°, 20° in particular.<br>
The suction pipe according to the invention can also with advantage be applied in a spinning frame without a condensing device, where, instead of being arranged besides the condensing element said suction pipe is being arranged next to a roller (12) with similar function, the so called front roller or outlet roller of the drafting unit.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
