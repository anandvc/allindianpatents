This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/885,325, filed on January 17,2007, the entire text of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background<br>
Targeting of drugs, toxins, and radionuclides to disease sites using tumor-selective monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) is an evolving field of biopharmaceutical research, with three approved products impacting the practice of medicine (Sharkey RM and Goldenberg DM, CA Cancer J Clin. 2006; 56:226-243).<br>
Typically, a MAb for an antigen expressed on a disease site, such as that on the surface of a tumor cell, is modified with drugs or toxins or radionuclides to form immunoconjugates, and the latter are targeted in vivo. In the formation of immunoconjugates, only a limited number of modifying groups can be introduced on to the antibody without affecting the MAb's immunoreactivity. Moreover, many of these modifiers, such as drugs, are generally hydrophobic, and cause solubility problems if the substitution is increased beyond a threshold level. These problems have been addressed by loading drugs or other moieties on to a water-soluble polymer such as dextran, and subsequently covalently linking the drug-polymer to antibodies to the Fc region carbohydrates site-specifically. See Shih, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,699,784 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,313, both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The size of the directly conjugated antibody-polymer-drug construct can be an issue in certain applications, and an alternative approach to increasing the concentration of the drugs at the disease site, other than using a direct immunoconjugate, is desirable.<br>
An approach that bypasses the limitations of using direct immunoconjugates, called 'pretargeting', makes use of a bi- or multispecific antibody with specificities for disease antigens as well as for a small molecular mass hapten (Goldenberg DM, et al.,JClin Oncol. 2006; 24: 823-834). In this method, the disease targeting step is temporally separated from the targeting of the drug molecule. Briefly, a bispecific or multispecific antibody is administered first to a patient. After the antibody localizes at the disease site by binding to<br>
disease-associated antigen, a second agent consisting of the drug attached to the small molecular mass hapten is administered. This drug-attached hapten selectively binds to the anti-hapten component of the bispecific antibody that has been pretargeted at the disease site. Generally, the second step agent is a small molecule, such as a peptide with hapten and drug attached to it, which clears rapidly from circulation, with a single or just a few passes at the tumor site where the material must be captured. In addition, the usual design of such second step agents results in only a few drug molecules attached. The combination of quick clearance and low drug substitution results in low specific activity of the drug at the disease site.<br>
There thus exists a need for developing new methods for targeting a large number of therapeutic agents to disease sites selectively. A general method, applicable to both direct immunoconjugate as well as the second step agent of pretargeting approach, would be highly desirable.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention solves the aforementioned problems of direct or pretargeting mode of antibody-based delivery of therapeutics by providing a therapeutic-loaded polymer that is also covalently attached to a low molecular weight peptide. For application to pretargeting, the peptide moiety may contain one or two hapten units, such as HSG (histamine-succinyl-glycine). The use of bispecific antibodies for diagnosis and therapy, illustrated with anti-HSG antibody as one arm of the bispecific is well known in the art, and methods for the preparation of HSG-containing peptides are also described in the art (U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,138,103 and 7,172,751, both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).<br>
For use with direct immunoconjugates, the peptide may contain functional group(s) for covalent linking to bi- or multivalent antibodies, or fragments thereof, in a manner that does not affect the antigen-binding properties of antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the peptide may be attached to bi- or multivalent antibodies or fragments thereof using the 'dock and lock (DNL)' technology (Rossi EA, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2006; 103:6841-6846; U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20060228300; 20070086942 and 20070140966, the text of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). These and other aspects of the invention are described in detail below.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
In preferred embodiments, the polymer, such as a dextran molecule, is derivatized to possess multiple carboxylic acid groups. A fraction of these carboxylic acid groups is derivatized by amide formation with ethylenediamine such that about one molecule of a maleimide-containing cross-linker is attached per molecule of the polymer. The remaining carboxylic acid groups are modified to possess a pre-determined level (substitution) of a functional group that is chemoselective for attachment to a drug. The substitution level of this functional group will determine the substitution level of drugs attached to the polymer.<br>
In one embodiment, the functional group on the polymer is an acetylene moiety. The polymer-(alkyne)x-peptide derivative is coupled with an azide-containing drug in a copper (+l)-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction called 'click chemistry' (Kolb HC and Sharpless KB, Drug Discov Today 2003; 8: 1128-37). Click chemistry takes place in aqueous solution at near-neutral pH conditions, and is thus amenable for drug conjugation. The advantage of click chemistry is that it is chemoselective, and complements other well-known conjugation chemistries such as the thiol-maleimide reaction. The attachment of drug to the polymer-peptide addend is carried out as a final step in the preparation of material for pretargeting. In the immunoconjugate formation in the context of the DNL approach, the drug can be attached to the polymer prior to DNL assembly. It can be also more advantageously performed as a final step after the DNL assembly, and this way the drug is not involved during the DNL process.<br>
In another embodiment, the functional group on the polymer is a hydrazide. The drug such as doxorubicin, containing a keto group, can be coupled to the hydrazide-appended polymer at a pH in the range of 5-to-7.<br>
In a third embodiment, the functional group on the polymer is a cyclodextrin molecule that can non-covalently bind to drugs by host-guest complexation.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymer can be substituted with 2 or more drugs. This is particularly suited for the click chemistry approach whereby a single polymer addend with multiple alkyne moieties (usually monosubstituted acetylenes) can be first coupled with one azide-containing drug. By limiting the molar equivalents, only a certain fraction of the acetylene groups are derivatized by the first drug-azide. The process is repeated with a second azide-containing drug so that the remaining acetylene groups are coupled. For<br>
example, the first drug can be doxorubicin which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor, and the second drug can be SN-38 which is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.<br>
When attached to the polymer by the click chemistry method, the bonding is via a stable triazole. A cleavable linker may additionally be built into the cross-linker between the drug and the azide to enable drug release.<br>
Embodiments with respect to the nature of the 'recognition moiety' are as follows: (1) It can be a peptide containing one or 2 molecules of a hapten such as HSG or DTP A, that binds specifically to anti-HSG or anti-DTPA antibodies, respectively. The drug-polymer-hapten can then be used in a pretargeting mode after first targeting the disease site with a bi-or multispecific antibody possessing at least one arm specific for the disease site and at least one arm specific for the hapten. Alternatively, a pre-complexed multispecific antibody-polymer-hapten may be utilized within the scope of this invention. (2) It can be folic acid, such that the polymer-drug-folate complex is used to target folate receptors on disease sites such as in cancers, in as much as targeting of folate receptors using folate-appended diagnostic or therapeutic moieties is a well known strategy. (3) It can be a peptide such as somatostatin (SS) or VIP peptide, useful for receptor-targeting at disease sites. (4) It can be biotin, for use in avidin/streptavidin-based pretargeting protocols. (5) It can be a complementary antisense oligonucleotide. (6) It can be the anchoring domain (AD) peptide of the 'dock and lock' (DNL) methodology (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 11/389,358, filed 3/24/06; 11/391,584, filed 3/28/06; 11/478,021, filed 6/29/06; and 11/633,729, filed 12/5/06, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The components specific for the 'recognition moieties' and part of the bi- or multispecific antibodies used in pretargeting protocol using embodiments 1 through 5 described in this paragraph are anti-HSG or anti-DTPA antibody; anti-folate antibody; anti-somatostatin antibody; avidin/streptavidin; or oligonucleotide, respectively. The counterpart component of the sixth embodiment is defined by the nature of the DNL methodology and for the AD sequence would be a complementary DDD sequence. In embodiments 2 and 3, the polymer-drug-folate or polymer-drug-SS can latch on to the bi- or multispecific antibody pretargeted at the disease site and also target the folate or SS receptors, respectively, thereby augmenting the mechanisms of targeting at the disease sites. The number of such recognition moieties introduced on to the polymer is preferebly 1-10, more preferably 1-5, and most preferably 1-2. The number of recognition moieties per polymer is preferably 1 when using in the context of DNL assemblage, but can be greater than 1 when used in pretargeting formats.<br>
Examples of drug-dextran are shown below. Scheme 1 gives a general approach to modification of polymer using acetylene-azide coupling chemistry, and is illustrated by structures 1 through 3.<br>

Alternatively, the polymer can be derivatized to contain an azide group in place of acetylene, and the drug can be derivatized with acetylene group instead of azide.<br>
Structure 4: This represents one type of linking by the 'click chemistry' to one type of drug. In this, 'Rm' is a recognition moiety, n= 0 ~ 16, x= 10 - 1000, and '(Z)' is additional spacer consisting of (CH2)m-NH-CO moiety, where m is an integer with values of 1-20, preferably 1-5, and most preferably 1.<br>
(Scheme removed)<br>
<br>
<br>
Structure 5: This represents one type of linking by the 'click chemistry' to 2 types of drugs (the 'recognition' moiety indicated by 'Rm'). Drug-1 can be an anthracycline drug, such as doxorubicin, which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor, while the second drug can be a camptothecin, such as SN-38, which is a topoisomerase I inhibitor. In this example, 'x' is the repeating dextran unit defined by the polymer size, 'n' is the number of moieties derivatized with drug 1 and drug 2, which defines the level of drug loading, and 'Z'is spacer. Although shown in this structure as 'n' for both drug 1 and drug 2, the value of 'n' can differ for drug 1 and drug 2 for different levels of the drug loadings. The acetylene-azide coupling results in a triazole structural moiety as shown. The spacer 1 and spacer 2 contain cleavable linker part. The cleavable linker can be an acid-cleavable hydrazone or cathepsin B cleavable peptide in the case of anthracycline such as doxorubicin, and it can be an ester or carbonate bond and/or a cathepsin B cleavable peptide in the case of a camptothecin. The drugs can be other than that indicated, and the multiplicity of drug types is not limited to 2. [In this structure, 'Rm' is a recognition moiety, n= 0 ~ 16, x= 10 - 1000, and '(Z)' is additional spacer consisting of (CH2)m-NH-CO moiety, where m is an integer with values of 1-20, preferably 1-5, and most preferably 1.]<br>

<br>
<br>
Structure 6: This is an example of chemoselective modification of dextran. In this example of 70KD MW dextran, 44 COOH groups are first introduced by reacting with 6-bromohexanoic acid, representing '11%' of monomeric unit (or 44 moieties) modified. Of these, 20 available COOH groups ('5%' of monomeric units) are converted to Boc-protected hydrazide using BOC-NHNH2 and water soluble carbodiimide, EDC. The remaining COOH groups are partly converted to terminate in an amine, using ethylene diamine and EDC coupling, such that 8 amines are substituted per polymer. Conditions have been developed to substitute just one of these amino groups with a modifier, such as pyridyldithio group of structure 7, for later attachment to a peptide.<br>
(Scheme removed)<br>
<br>
<br>
Structure 7: This structure shows that an average of one SPDP molecule can be substituted on to the 70 kD dextran. By first reacting with a thiol-containing peptide in a diulfide-exchange reaction, an average of one peptide can be introduced. Alternatively, the disulfide of structure 7 can be reduced with dithiothreitol or TCEP, and the thiol-containing dextran can be reacted with a maleimide-containing peptide. Yet another variation is that the<br>
amine on dextran is derivatized with a maleimide-containing cross-linker for further reaction with a thiol-containing peptide. The peptide moiety contains one or two hapten molecules, such as HSG, or it is 'AD' peptide suitable for fusing with 'DDD' component of DNL methodology. BOC-deprotection under acidic conditions then liberates hydrazide, suitable for reacting with aldehyde or keto group on a drug. Alternatively, and more preferably in the DNL approach, the hydrazide moiety is replaced by acetylene group that can be later coupled to azide-containing drug. An advantage in this approach is that the DNL assembly can be first performed, and the resultant assembly will contain drug signatures, which are actually the acetylene (or azide) groups. The DNL product can be reacted chemoselectively with an azide (or acetylene)-appended drug. An advantage of pre-assembly of DNL product is that the drug can be defined subsequently. And, for each assembly, containing a defined multivalent antibody component, one could substitute different drug types by using the corresponding azide-derivatized drugs.<br>
While the nature of 'recognition moiety' is defined in the DNL product as 'AD' peptide, it can be variable in other examples as enumerated in a previous section.<br>
(Scheme removed)<br>
<br>
<br>
Structure 8: This is a variation of structure 2, showing the substitution on dextran of cyclodextrin instead of acetylene. A suitable drug, such as doxorubicin, capable of forming non-covalent complex with cyclodextrin is subsequently added. Cyclodextrin substitution determines drug substitution. [In this structure, 'Rm' is a recognition moiety, n= 0 ~ 16, x= 10 - 1000, and '(Z)' is additional spacer consisting of (CH2)m-NH-CO moiety, where m is an integer with values of 1-20, preferably 1-5, and most preferably 1.]<br>
(Scheme removed)<br>
<br>
<br>
Structure 9: This is a variation of structure 5, showing the substitution on dextran of one drug via 'click chemistry' and the substitution of cyclodextrin for complexation with a second drug. As in other illustrations, 'Rm' is a recognition moiety, n= 0 ~ 16, x= 10 - 1000, and '(Z)' is additional spacer consisting of (CH2)m-NH-CO moiety, where m is an integer with values of 1-20, preferably 1-5, and most preferably 1.<br>

Water-soluble polymers such as dextran, polyglutamic acid, dendrimers, and so on, are within the scope of the invention. Although exemplified with dextran, the polymer component is not limited to dextran. Polyglutamic acid already has carboxylic acid groups in it, and so it is equivalent to the carboxylic acid-added dextran from the viewpoint of this disclosure. Whatever strategies are described for COOH-added dextran are equally applicable for polyglutamic acid. With different generation dendrimers, functional groups are derivatized sequentially to contain drug signatures such as alkyne or azide derivatizable<br>
with azide-drug or alkyne-drug, respectively, and other derivatives that can be coupled to Afunctional drug derivatives.<br>
Therapeutic agents for use in this invention include, for example, chemotherapeutic drugs such as vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epidophyllotoxins, taxanes, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, antibiotics, Cox-2 inhibitors, antimitotics, antiangiogenic and proapoptotic agents, particularly doxorubicin, methotrexate, taxol, camptothecins, and others from these and other classes of anticancer agents, and the like. Other cancer chemotherapeutic drugs include nitrogen mustards, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, triazenes, folic acid analogs, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, platinum coordination complexes, hormones, and the like. Suitable chemotherapeutic agents are described in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 19th Ed. (Mack Publishing Co. 1995), and in GOODMAN AND GILMAN'S THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS, 7th Ed. (MacMillan Publishing Co. 1985), as well as revised editions of these publications. Other suitable chemotherapeutic agents, such as experimental drugs, are known to those of skill in the art. Therapeutic agents to be used with the present invention also may be toxins including ricin, abrin, ribonuclease (RNase), DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, diphtherin toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin, and Pseudomonas endotoxin. (See, e.g., Pastan. et al., Cell (1986), 47:641, and Goldenberg, CA - A Cancer Journal for Clinicians (1994), 44:43.) Additional toxins suitable for use herein are known to those of skill in the art and are disclosed in U.S. 6,077,499, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the targeting moiety may be a multivalent and/or multispecific MAb. In another embodiment, the targeting moiety is multivalent antibody fragment made with DNL (dock-and-lock) methodology. The targeting moiety may be a murine, chimeric, humanized, or human monoclonal antibody, and said antibody is in intact, fragment (Fab, Fab', F(ab)2, F(ab')2), or sub-fragment (single-chain constructs) form.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is reactive with an antigen or epitope of an antigen expressed on a cancer or malignant cell. The cancer cell is preferably a cell from a hematopoietic tumor, carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma or a glial tumor.<br>
A preferred malignancy to be treated according to the present invention is a malignant solid tumor or hematopoietic neoplasm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an intracellularly-cleavable moiety incorporated in the 'drug-polymer-recognition moiety' may be cleaved after its conjugate with the pretargeted multispecific antibody, or its non-covalent complex with the multispecific antibody, or a covalent DNL construct is internalized into the cell, and particularly cleaved by esterases and peptidases or by pH-dependent processes or by disulfide reduction.<br>
The targeting moiety is preferably an antibody (including fully human, non-human, humanized, or chimeric antibodies) or an antibody fragment (including enzymatically or recombinantly produced fragments) and binding proteins incorporating sequences from antibodies or antibody fragments. The antibodies, fragments, and binding proteins may be multivalent and multispecific or multivalent and monospecific as defined above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, antibodies, such as MAbs, are used that recognize or bind to markers or tumor-associated antigens that are expressed at high levels on target cells and that are expressed predominantly or only on diseased cells versus normal tissues, and antibodies that internalize rapidly. Antibodies useful within the scope of the present invention include MAbs with properties as described above (and show distinguishing properties of different levels of internalization into cells and microorganisms), and contemplate the use of, but are not limited to, in cancer, the following MAbs: LL1 (anti-CD74), LL2 and RFB4 (anti-CD22), RS7 (anti-epithelial glycoprotein-1 (EGP-1)), PAM-4 and KC4 (both anti-MUCl), MN-14 (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, also known as CD66e), Mu-9 (anti-colon-specific antigen-p), Immu 31 (an anti-alpha-fetoprotein), TAG-72 (e.g., CC49), Tn, J591 (anti-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)), G250 (an anti-carbonic anhydrase IX MAb) and L243 (anti-HLA-DR). Other useful antigens that may be targeted using these conjugates include HER-2/wew, BrE3, CD 19, CD20 (e.g., C2B8, hA20, 1F5 MAbs) CD21, CD23, CD37, CD45, CD74, CD80, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), VEGFR (e.g., Avastin®, fibronectin splice variant), ED-B (e.g., LI9), EGF receptor or ErbBl (e.g., Erbitux ®), ErbB2, ErbB3, placental growth factor (P1GF), MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, PSMA, gangliosides, HCG, EGP-2 (e.g., 17-1A), CD37, HLA-DR, CD30, la, A3, A33, Ep-CAM, KS-1, Le(y), SI00, PSA (prostate-specific antigen), tenascin, folate receptor, Thomas-Friedenreich antigens, tumor necrosis antigens, tumor angiogenesis antigens, Ga 733, IL-2, IL-6, T101, MAGE, insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), migration inhibition factor (MIF), the HLA-DR antigen to which L243 binds, CD66 antigens, i.e. CD66a-d or a combination thereof. The CD66 antigens consist of five different glycoproteins with similar structures, CD66a-e, encoded by the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family members, BCG,<br>
CGM6, NCA, CGM1 and CEA, respectively. These CD66 antigens are expressed mainly in granulocytes, normal epithelial cells of the digestive tract and tumor cells of various tissues. A number of the aforementioned antigens are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/426,379, entitled "Use of Multi-specific, Non-covalent Complexes for Targeted Delivery of Therapeutics," filed November 15,2002, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention involving polymer-therapeutic-recognition moiety precomplexed or fused by the DNL methodology, antibodies are used that internalize rapidly and are then re-expressed, processed and presented on cell surfaces, enabling continual uptake and accretion of circulating conjugate by the cell. An example of a most-preferred antibody/antigen pair is LLl, an anti-CD74 MAb (invariant chain, class H-specific chaperone, Ii). The CD74 antigen is highly expressed on B-cell lymphomas, certain T-cell lymphomas, melanomas and certain other cancers (Ong et al., Immunology £5:296-302 (1999)), as well as certain autoimmune diseases. This embodiment is particularly preferred as a pre-complexed or DNL construct incorporating polymer-therapeutic-recognition moiety.<br>
The diseases that are preferably treated with anti-CD74 antibodies include, but are not limited to, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, lung cancer, myeloid leukemias, and multiple myeloma. Continual expression of the CD74 antigen for short periods of time on the surface of target cells, followed by internalization of the antigen, and re-expression of the antigen, enables the targeting LLl antibody to be internalized along with any chemotherapeutic moiety it carries. This allows a high, and therapeutic, concentration of LLl-chemotherapeutic drug conjugate to be accumulated inside such cells. Internalized LL1-chemotherapeutic drug conjugates are cycled through lysosomes and endosomes, and the chemotherapeutic moiety is released in an active form within the target cells.<br>
Another embodiment relates to a method of treating a subject, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic conjugate of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to a subject. Diseases that may be treated with the therapeutic conjugates of the preferred embodiments include, but are not limited to B-cell malignancies (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia using, for example LL2 MAb; see U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,744), adenocarcinomas of endodermally-derived digestive system epithelia, cancers such as breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and other carcinomas, sarcomas, glial tumors, myeloid leukemias, etc. In particular, antibodies against an antigen, e.g., an oncofetal antigen, produced by or associated with a malignant<br>
solid tumor or hematopoietic neoplasm, e.g., a gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, testicular, brain or lymphatic tumor, a sarcoma or a melanoma, are advantageously used. Such therapeutics can be given once or repeatedly, depending on the disease state and tolerability of the conjugate, and can also be used optimally in combination with other therapeutic modalities, such as surgery, external radiation, radioimmunotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, antisense therapy, interference RNA therapy, gene therapy, and the like. Each combination will be adapted to the tumor type, stage, patient condition and prior therapy, and other factors considered by the managing physician.<br>
As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any animal (i.e., vertebrates and invertebrates) including, but not limited to mammals, including humans. The term subject also includes rodents (e.g., mice, rats, and guinea pigs). It is not intended that the term be limited to a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are encompassed by the term.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, therapeutic conjugates comprising the Mu-9 MAb can be used to treat colorectal, as well as pancreatic and ovarian cancers as disclosed in U.S. Application Serial No. 10/116,116, filed April 5,2002 and by Gold et al. (Cancer Res. 50: 6405 (1990), and references cited therein). In addition, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the PAM-4 MAb can be used to treat pancreatic cancer, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/388,314, filed June 14, 2002.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the RS-7 MAb can be used to treat carcinomas such as carcinomas of the lung, stomach, urinary bladder, breast, ovary, uterus, and prostate, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/360,229, filed March 1,2002 and by Stein ef al. (CancerRes. 50: 1330(1990) and Antibody Immunoconj. Radiopharm. 4: 703 (1991)).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the anti-AFP MAb can be used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, germ cell tumors, and other AFP-producing tumors using humanized, chimeric and human antibody forms, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/399,707, filed August 1,2002.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising anti-tenascin antibodies can be used to treat hematopoietic and solid tumors and conjugates comprising antibodies to Le(y) can be used to treat solid tumors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies that are used in the treatment of human disease are human or humanized (CDR-grafted) versions of antibodies; although murine and chimeric versions of antibodies can be used. Same species IgG molecules as delivery agents are mostly preferred to minimize immune responses. This is particularly important when considering repeat treatments. For humans, a human or humanized IgG antibody is less likely to generate an anti-IgG immune response from patients. Antibodies such as hLLl and hLL2 rapidly internalize after binding to internalizing antigen on target cells, which means that the chemotherapeutic drug being carried is rapidly internalized into cells as well. However, antibodies that have slower rates of internalization can also be used to effect selective therapy with this invention.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates can be used against pathogens, since antibodies against pathogens are known. For example, antibodies and antibody fragments which specifically bind markers produced by or associated with infectious lesions, including viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, for example caused by pathogens such as bacteria, rickettsia, mycoplasma, protozoa, fungi, and viruses, and antigens and products associated with such microorganisms have been disclosed, inter alia, in Hansen et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,927,193 and Goldenberg U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,331,647, 4,348,376, 4,361,544,4,468,457,4,444,744,4,818,709 and 4,624,846, and in Reichert and Dewitz, cited above. In a preferred embodiment, the pathogens are selected from the group consisting of HIV virus causing AIDS, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus agalactiae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophilia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhosae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pneumococcus, Hemophilis influenzae B, Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease spirochetes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium leprae, Brucella abortus, rabies virus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus I, herpes simplex virus II, human serum parvo-like virus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, measles virus, adenovirus, human T-cell leukemia viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, murine leukemia virus, mumps virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, wart virus, blue tongue virus, Sendai virus, feline leukemia virus, reo virus, polio virus, simian virus 40, mouse mammary tumor virus, dengue virus, rubella virus, West Nile virus, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rhodesiensei, Trypanosoma brucei, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japanicum, Babesia bovis, Elmeria tenella, Onchocerca volvulus, Leishmania<br>
tropica, Trichinella spiralis, Theileriaparva, Taenia hydatigena, Taenia ovis, Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus, Mesocestoides corti, Mycoplasma arthritidis, M. hyorhinis, M. orale, M. arginini, Acholeplasma laidlawii, M. salivarium and M. pneumoniae, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,416.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, drug conjugates comprising anti-gpl20 and other such anti-HIV antibodies can be used as therapeutics for HIV in AIDS patients; and drug conjugates of antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis are suitable as therapeutics for drug-refractive tuberculosis. Fusion proteins of anti-gpl20 MAb (anti HIV MAb) and a toxin, such as Pseudomonas exotoxin, have been examined for antiviral properties (Van Oigen et al, J Drug Target, 5:75-91,1998)). Attempts at treating HIV infection in AIDS patients failed possibly due to insufficient efficacy or unacceptable host toxicity. The drug conjugates of the present invention advantageously lack such toxic side effects of protein toxins, and are therefore advantageously used in treating HIV infection in AIDS patients. These drug conjugates can be given alone or in combination with other antibiotics or therapeutic agents that are effective in such patients when given alone.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, diseases that may be treated using the therapeutic conjugates include, but are not limited to immune dysregulation disease and related autoimmune diseases, including Class III autoimmune diseases such as immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, such as acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Sydenham's chorea, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, rheumatic fever, polyglandular syndromes, bullous pemphigoid, diabetes mellitus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, post-streptococcal nephritis, erythema nodosum, Takayasu's arteritis, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, erythema multiforme, IgA nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa, ankylosing spondylitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, thromboangitis ubiterans, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis, scleroderma, chronic active hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, polychondritis, pamphigus vulgaris, Wegener's granulomatosis, membranous nephropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tabes dorsalis, giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia, pernicious anemia, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and fibrosing alveolitis, and also juvenile diabetes, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/360,259, filed March 1,2002. Typical antibodies useful in these diseases include, but are not limited to, those reactive with HLA-DR antigens or B-cell or T-cell<br>
antigens (e.g., CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD33, CD37, CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD46, CD52, CD54, CD74, CD80, CD126, B7, MUC1, la, HM1.24, and HLA-DR). Since many of these autoimmune diseases are affected by autoantibodies made by aberrant B-cell populations, depletion of these B-cells by therapeutic conjugates involving such antibodies bound with the drugs used in this invention, is a preferred method of autoimmune disease therapy, especially when B-cell antibodies are combined, in certain circumstances, with HLA-DR antibodies and/or T-cell antibodies (including those which target IL-2 as an antigen, such as anti-TAC antibody). In a preferred embodiment, the anti-B-cell, anti-T-cell, or anti-macrophage or other such antibodies of use in the treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases also can be conjugated to result in more effective therapeutics to control the host responses involved in said autoimmune diseases, and can be given alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as TNF inhibitors or TNF antibodies, unconjugated B- or T-cell antibodies, and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, diseases that may be treated using the therapeutic conjugates include cardiovascular diseases, such as fibrin clots, atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia and infarction. Antibodies to fibrin are known and in clinical trials as imaging agents for disclosing said clots and pulmonary emboli, while anti-granulocyte antibodies, such as MN-3, MN-15, NCA95, and CD 15 antibodies, can target myocardial infarcts and myocardial ischemia, while anti-macrophage, anti-low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and anti-CD74 (e.g., hLLl) antibodies can be used to target atherosclerotic plaques.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, diseases that may be treated using the therapeutic conjugates include neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a specific lesions against which a targeting moiety can be used, such as amyloid or beta-amyloid associated with Alzheimer's disease, and which serves as a target for localizing antibodies.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a more effective incorporation into cells and pathogens can be accomplished by using multivalent, multispecific or multivalent, monospecific antibodies. Multivalent means the use of several binding arms against the same or different antigen or epitope expressed on the cells, whereas multispecific antibodies involve the use of multiple binding arms to target at least two different antigens or epitopes contained on the targeted cell or pathogen. Examples of such bivalent and bispecific antibodies are found in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 60/399,707, filed August 1, 2002; 60/360,229, filed March 1,2002; 60/388,314, filed June 14, 2002; and 10/116,116, filed April 5,2002, all of<br>
which are incorporated by reference herein. These multivalent or multispecific antibodies are particularly preferred in the targeting of cancers and infectious organisms (pathogens), which express multiple antigen targets and even multiple epitopes of the same antigen target, but which often evade antibody targeting and sufficient binding for immunotherapy because of insufficient expression or availability of a single antigen target on the cell or pathogen. By targeting multiple antigens or epitopes, said antibodies show a higher binding and residence time on the target, thus affording a higher saturation with the drug being targeted in this invention.<br>
In various embodiments, a conjugate as disclosed herein may be part of a composite, multispecific antibody. Such antibodies may contain two or more different antigen binding sites, with differing specificities. The multispecific composite may bind to different epitopes of the same antigen, or alternatively may bind to two different antigens. Some of the more preferred target combinations include the following. This is a list of examples of preferred combinations, but is not intended to be exhaustive.<br>

<br>
(Table removed)<br>
<br>
Still other combinations, such as are preferred for cancer therapies, include CD20 + CD22 antibodies, CD74 + CD20 antibodies, CEACAM5 (CEA) + CEACAM6 antibodies, insulin-like growth factor (ILGF) + CEACAM5 antibodies, EGP-1 (e.g., RS-7) + ILGF antibodies, CEACAM5 + EGFR antibodies. Such antibodies need not only be used in combination, but can be combined as fusion proteins of various forms, such as IgG, Fab, scFv, and the like, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,083,477; 6,183,744 and 6,962,702 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20030124058; 20030219433; 20040001825; 20040202666; 20040219156; 20040219203; 20040235065; 20050002945; 20050014207; 20050025709; 20050079184; 20050169926; 20050175582; 20050249738; 20060014245 and 20060034759, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
In certain embodiments, the binding moieties described herein may comprise one or more avimer sequences. Avimers are a class of binding proteins somewhat similar to antibodies in their affinities and specificities for various target molecules. They were developed from human extracellular receptor domains by in vitro exon shuffling and phage display. (Silverman et ai, 2005, Nat. Biotechnol., 23:1493-94; Silverman et al, 2006, Nat. Biotechnol, 24:220.) The resulting multidomain proteins may comprise multiple independent binding domains, which may exhibit improved affinity (in some cases sub-nanomolar) and specificity compared with single-epitope binding proteins. (Id.) In various embodiments, avimers may be attached to, for example, AD and/or DDD sequences for use in the claimed methods and compositions, as described in provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 60/668,603, filed 4/6/05 and 60/751196, filed 12/16/05, each incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Additional details concerning methods of construction and use of avimers are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040175756, 20050048512,20050053973, 20050089932 and 20050221384, the Examples section of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DNL (Dock and Lock) Technology<br>
Various embodiments of DNL technology for forming complexes comprising different effector moieties are known in the art. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publ. Nos. 20060228300; 20070086942; 20070140966.) The DNL technique is based upon the formation of complexes of naturally occurring binding molecules, for example between the dimerization and docking domain (DDD) regions of the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the anchoring domain sequence obtained from a wide variety of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). The DDD domains spontaneously dimerize and then bind to a single AD sequence. Thus, various effectors may be attached to DDD and AD sequences to form complexes of defined stoichiometry. In the simplest case, the result is a trimer comprising two identical subunits that incorporate a DDD sequence and one subunit that incorporates an AD sequence. However, many variations on such assemblages are possible, including homodimers, homotetramers, heterotetramers and homo or heterohexamers (see US Patent Application Publ. Nos. 20060228357 and 20070140966 ). Exemplary DDD and AD sequences that may be utilized in the DNL method to form synthetic complexes are disclosed below.<br>

Production of Antibody Fragments<br>
Methods of monoclonal antibody production are well known in the art and any such known method may be used to produce antibodies of use in the claimed methods and compositions. Some embodiments may concern antibody fragments. Such antibody<br>
fragments may be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. For example, antibody fragments may be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F(ab')2. This fragment may be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent and, optionally, a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups resulting from cleavage of disulfide linkages, to produce 3.5S Fab' monovalent fragments. Alternatively, an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment. Exemplary methods for producing antibody fragments are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,945; U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647; Nisonoff et al, 1960, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 89:230; Porter, 1959, Biochem. J., 73:119; Edelman et al, 1967, METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, page 422 (Academic Press), and Coligan etal. (eds.), 1991, CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY, (John Wiley &amp; Sons).<br>
Other methods of cleaving antibodies, such as separation of heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments, further cleavage of fragments or other enzymatic, chemical or genetic techniques also may be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. For example, Fv fragments comprise an association of VH and VL chains. This association can be noncovalent, as described in Inbar et al, 1972, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 69:2659. Alternatively, the variable chains may be linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond or cross-linked by chemicals such as glutaraldehyde. See Sandhu, 1992, Crit. Rev. Biotech., 12:437.<br>
Preferably, the Fv fragments comprise VH and VL chains connected by a peptide linker. These single-chain antigen binding proteins (sFv) are prepared by constructing a structural gene comprising DNA sequences encoding the VH and VL domains, connected by an oligonucleotide linker sequence. Methods for producing sFvs are well-known in the art. See Whitlow et al., 1991, Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 2:97; Bird et al., 1988, Science, 242:423; U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Pack etal, 1993, Bio/Technology, 11:1271, and Sandhu, 1992, Crit. Rev. Biotech., 12:437.<br>
Another form of an antibody fragment is a peptide coding for a single complementarity-determining region (CDR). CDR peptides ("minimal recognition units") can be obtained by constructing genes encoding the CDR of an antibody of interest. Such genes are prepared, for example, by using the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region from RNA of antibody-producing cells. See Larrick et al, 1991, Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 2:106; Ritter etal. (eds.), 1995, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING AND CLINICAL APPLICATION, pages<br>
166-179 (Cambridge University Press); Birch et al, (eds.), 1995, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS, pages 137-185 (Wiley-Liss, Inc.)<br>
Chimeric and Humanized Antibodies<br>
A chimeric antibody is a recombinant protein in which the variable regions of a human antibody have been replaced by the variable regions of, for example, a mouse antibody, including the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the mouse antibody. Chimeric antibodies exhibit decreased immunogenicity and increased stability when administered to a subject. Methods for constructing chimeric antibodies are well known in the art {e.g., Leung et al., 1994, Hybridoma, 13:469).<br>
A chimeric monoclonal antibody may be humanized by transferring the mouse CDRs from the heavy and light variable chains of the mouse immunoglobulin into the corresponding variable domains of a human antibody. The mouse framework regions (FR) in the chimeric monoclonal antibody are also replaced with human FR sequences. To preserve the stability and antigen specificity of the humanized monoclonal, one or more human FR residues may be replaced by the mouse counterpart residues. Humanized monoclonal antibodies may be used for therapeutic treatment of subjects. The affinity of humanized antibodies for a target may also be increased by selected modification of the CDR sequences (WO0029584A1). Techniques for production of humanized monoclonal antibodies are well known in the art. (See, e.g., Jones et al., 1986, Nature, 321:522; Riechmann et al., Nature, 1988, 332:323; Verhoeyen et al, 1988, Science, 239:1534; Carter etal, 1992, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285; Sandhu, Crit. Rev. Biotech., 1992, 12:437; Tempest etal, 1991, Biotechnology, 9:266; Singer et al, J. Immun., 1993,150:2844.)<br>
Other embodiments may concern non-human primate antibodies. General techniques for raising therapeutically useful antibodies in baboons may be found, for example, in Goldenberg et al, WO 91/11465 (1991), and in Losman et al, Int. J. Cancer, 46: 310 (1990). In another embodiment, an antibody may be a human monoclonal antibody. Such antibodies are obtained from transgenic mice that have been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain locus are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. The transgenic mice can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens, and the mice can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas. Methods for obtaining<br>
human antibodies from transgenic mice are described by Green et al, Nature Genet., 7:13 (1994), Lonberg et al, Nature, 368:856 (1994), and Taylor et al, Int. Immun., 6:579 (1994).<br>
Human Antibodies<br>
Methods for producing fully human antibodies using either combinatorial approaches or transgenic animals transformed with human immunoglobulin loci are known in the art (e.g., Mancini et al, 2004, New Microbiol. 27:315-28; Conrad and Scheller, 2005, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 8:117-26; Brekke and Loset, 2003, Curr. Opin. Phamacol. 3:544-50; each incorporated herein by reference). Such fully human antibodies are expected to exhibit even fewer side effects than chimeric or humanized antibodies and to function in vivo as essentially endogenous human antibodies. In certain embodiments, the claimed methods and procedures may utilize human antibodies produced by such techniques.<br>
In one alternative, the phage display technique may be used to generate human antibodies (e.g., Dantas-Barbosa et al, 2005, Genet. Mol. Res. 4:126-40, incorporated herein by reference). Human antibodies may be generated from normal humans or from humans that exhibit a particular disease state, such as cancer (Dantas-Barbosa et al, 2005). The advantage to constructing human antibodies from a diseased individual is that the circulating antibody repertoire may be biased towards antibodies against disease-associated antigens. In one non-limiting example of this methodology, Dantas-Barbosa et al. (2005) constructed a phage display library of human Fab antibody fragments from osteosarcoma patients. The skilled artisan will realize that this technique is exemplary only and any known method for making and screening human antibodies or antibody fragments by phage display may be utilized.<br>
In another alternative, transgenic animals that have been genetically engineered to produce human antibodies may be used to generate antibodies against essentially any immunogenic target, using standard immunization protocols as discussed above. A non-limiting example of such a system is the XenoMouse® (e.g., Green et al, 1999, J. Immunol. Methods 231:11-23, incorporated herein by reference) from Abgenix (Fremont, CA). In the XenoMouse® and similar animals, the mouse antibody genes have been inactivated and replaced by functional human antibody genes, while the remainder of the mouse immune system remains intact.<br>
A XenoMouse® immunized with a target antigen will produce human antibodies by the normal immune response, which may be harvested and/or produced by standard<br>
techniques discussed above. A variety of strains of XenoMouse® are available, each of which is capable of producing a different class of antibody. Such human antibodies may be coupled to other molecules by chemical cross-linking or other known methodologies. Transgenically produced human antibodies have been shown to have therapeutic potential, while retaining the pharmacokinetic properties of normal human antibodies (Green et al., 1999). The skilled artisan will realize that the claimed compositions and methods are not limited to use of the XenoMouse® system but may utilize any transgenic animal that has been genetically engineered to produce human antibodies.<br>
Avimers<br>
In certain embodiments, the precursors, monomers and/or complexes described herein may comprise one or more avimer sequences. Avimers are a class of binding proteins somewhat similar to antibodies in their affinities and specifities for various target molecules. They were developed from human extracellular receptor domains by in vitro exon shuffling and phage display. (Silverman et al, 2005, Nat. Biotechnol, 23:1493-94; Silverman et al., 2006, Nat. Biotechnol, 24:220.) The resulting multidomain proteins may comprise multiple independent binding domains, that may exhibit improved affinity (in some cases sub-nanomolar) and specificity compared with single-epitope binding proteins. (Id.) In various embodiments, avimers may be attached to, for example, DDD sequences for use in the claimed methods and compositions. Additional details concerning methods of construction and use of avimers are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040175756,20050048512,20050053973, 20050089932 and 20050221384, the Examples section of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Phage Display<br>
Certain embodiments of the claimed compositions and/or methods may concern binding peptides and/or peptide mimetics of various target molecules, cells or tissues. Binding peptides may be identified by any method known in the art, including but not limiting to the phage display technique. Various methods of phage display and techniques for producing diverse populations of peptides are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,409; 5,622,699 and 6,068,829, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, disclose methods for preparing a phage library. The phage display technique involves genetically manipulating bacteriophage so that small peptides can be expressed on their surface (Smith and Scott, 1985, Science, 228:1315-1317; Smith and Scott, 1993, Meth. Enzymol, 21:228-257).<br>
Targeting amino acid sequences selective for a given organ, tissue, cell type or target molecule may be isolated by pannmg (Pasqualini and Ruoslahti, 1996, Nature, 380:364-366; Pasqualini, 1999, The Quart. J. Nucl. Med., 43:159-162). In brief, a library of phage containing putative targeting peptides is administered to an intact organism or to isolated organs, tissues, cell types or target molecules and samples containing bound phage are collected. Phage that bind to a target may be eluted from a target organ, tissue, cell type or target molecule and then amplified by growing them in host bacteria.<br>
Multiple rounds of panning may be performed until a population of selective or specific binders is obtained. The amino acid sequence of the peptides may be determined by sequencing the DNA corresponding to the targeting peptide insert in the phage genome. The identified targeting peptide may then be produced as a synthetic peptide by standard protein chemistry techniques (Arap et al., 1998a, Smith et al., 1985).<br>
Aptamers<br>
In certain embodiments, a targeting moiety of use may be an aptamer. Methods of constructing and determining the binding characteristics of aptamers are well known in the art. For example, such techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,582,981, 5,595,877 and 5,637,459, each incorporated herein by reference. Methods for preparation and screening of aptamers that bind to particular targets of interest are well known, for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,096 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,163, each incorporated by reference.<br>
Aptamers may be prepared by any known method, including synthetic, recombinant, and purification methods, and may be used alone or in combination with other ligands specific for the same target. In general, a minimum of approximately 3 nucleotides, preferably at least 5 nucleotides, are necessary to effect specific binding. Aptamers of sequences shorter than 10 bases may be feasible, although aptamers of 10,20, 30 or 40 nucleotides may be preferred.<br>
Aptamers need to contain the sequence that confers binding specificity, but may be extended with flanking regions and otherwise derivatized. In preferred embodiments, the binding sequences of aptamers may be flanked by primer-binding sequences, facilitating the amplification of the aptamers by PCR or other amplification techniques.<br>
Aptamers may be isolated, sequenced, and/or amplified or synthesized as conventional DNA or RNA molecules. Alternatively, aptamers of interest may comprise modified oligomers. Any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in aptamers may be<br>
replaced by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by a standard protecting group, or activated to prepare additional linkages to other nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups, such as P(0)0 replaced by P(0)S, P(0)NR2, P(0)R, P(0)0R', CO, or CNR2, wherein R is H or alkyl (1-20C) and R' is alkyl (1-20C); in addition, this group may be attached to adjacent nucleotides through O or S. Not all linkages in an oligomer need to be identical.<br>
Conjugation Protocols<br>
The preferred conjugation protocol is based on an alkyne-azide (preferably monosubstiruted acetylene-azide), a thiol-maleimide, a thiol-vinylsulfone, a thiol-bromoacetamide, or a thiol-iodoacetamide reaction that are facile at neutral or slightly acidic pH.<br>
Suitable routes of administration of the conjugates of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include, without limitation, oral, parenteral, rectal, transmucosal, intestinal administration, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intravitreal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. The preferred routes of administration are parenteral. Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into a solid tumor.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention is illustrated with examples below without limiting the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1: Introduction of COOH groups on dextran<br>
Dextran (70 kD MW) was derivatized with 5-bromohexanoic acid and 4 M sodium hydroxide at 80 °C for 3 h. The material was then acidified to pH ~ 4, optionally extracted with an organic solvent to remove unreacted bromohexanoic acid, and dialyzed, in a 10 kD molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) dialysis cassette, against water with 3 water changes. The aqueous product was lyophilized. A known amount of modified dextran was titrated against 0.1 N sodium hydroxide to estimate the number of carboxylic acid groups introduced. This showed that 44-to-100 COOH groups were introduced per dextran, corresponding to 11 % to 25% of monomelic units modified.<br>
Example 2: Derivatization of COOH-appended dextran (70 kD MVV)<br>
The product of Example 1, with 44 COOH/70 kD dextran, was treated with water soluble carbodiimide, EDC, and BOC-hydrazine, each at an equivalent corresponding to ~ 50% of the COOH content. Briefly, EDC treatment was done at an acidic pH of- 6, and then the monoprotected hydrazine was added and the pH was raised to 7.4 . After incubation for 2 to 3 h at the room temperature, the product was purified by ultrafiltration using centifugal filter with a 30 K MWCO. The recovered product was determined, by titration against 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, to contain 24 COOH/70 kD dextran. This indicated derivatization of 20 COOH moieties as BOC hydrazide. The process was repeated with further derivatization using EDC and ethylene diamine such that the new intermediate now had 8 amino groups, 20 BOC hydrazide and 16 COOH per dextran. Finally, optimization was carried out for introducing - 1 reactive moiety per dextran polymer. This was done by reacting amine, BOC-hydrazide and COOH-containing dextran with varying molar equivalents of SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-PyridylDithio)-Proprionate), and analyzing the number of activated disulfide groups so introduced by spectrophotometrically assaying for 2 thiopyridone, at 343 nm, liberated by reaction with dithiothreitol. This analysis showed that a 1: 1 level of activated disufide-to-dextran substitution was obtained when using a 5.3-fold molar excess of SPDP reagent.<br>
Example 3: Sequential derivatization of COOH-appended dextran (40 kD MW) to a<br>
doxorubicin-substituted polymer<br>
Dextran (40 kD) was derivatized with bromohexanoic acid and sodium hydroxide, as in Example 1, to possess - 60 COOH per dextran; this was derivatized with BOC hydrazine and EDC to - 50% level of COOH content, which was - 30 Boc-hydrazide groups. Deprotection was carried out with 3M hydrochloric acid, and the product was purified by ultrafiltration. Conjugation with doxorubicin was examined under conditions of pH 5 and pH 6. This showed that aqueous condition derivatization was more efficient at pH 5, with the introduction of 20 Dox groups versus 12 Dox introduced at pH 6. Doxorubicin content was determined from absorbance at 496 nm and correlation with a doxorubicin standard curve.<br>
Example 4: Sequential derivatization of COOH-appended dextran (40 kD MW) to a doxorubicin-substituted polymer by the 'click chemistry' approach<br>
Carboxyl-derivatized dextran (40 kD; - 60 COOH) from Example 3 (0.0047 mmol of dextran; 0.282 mmol w.r.t. COOH) was reacted with 2.6 mmol of EDC and 2.1 mmol of<br>
propargylamine. The product, acetylene-added dextran, was purified by repeated ultrafiltration-diafiltration. The acetylene content was estimated to be 50-to-60 per 40 kd MW dextran, based on back-titration of the underivatized carboxylic acid groups.<br>
The azide-incorporated doxorubicin hydrazone was prepared from doxorubicin (0.44 mmol) and 6-azidohexanoic acid hydrazide (as TFA salt; 1.5 mmol) in methanol at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated off, and the excess hydrazide reagent was removed by trituration with acetonitrile. The solid product so obtained had a retention time of 9.92 min when analyzed on a reverse phase HPLC column using gradient elution (100 % A going to 100% B in 10 min at a flow of 3 mL/min, and maintaining at 100% B for the next 5 min; A = 0.3% ammonium acetate pH 4.43; B = 90% acetonitrile, 10 % A; in-line absorbance detection at 254 nm), and was 75% pure, with the remaining material mostly composed of unreacted doxorubicin. The product showed, in electrospray mass spectrum, peaks at m/e 696 (M-H), and m/e 732 (M+ CI), indicating the identity of the product. [The hydrazide reagent used herein was prepared in 3 steps from 6-bromohexanoic acid (2 g) by first reacting with sodium azide (1 g) in DMSO at 50 °C for 2 hr followed by extractive work up with water and ethylacetate. The ethylacetate extract was washed sequentially with IN HC1 solution and brine and dried. The product after solvent removal was re-dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and reacted with 2g of EDC (10 mmol) and 1.4 g (10 mmol) of BOC-hydrazide for 1 hour at ambient temperature. Extractive work up with IN HC1, satd. NaHC03, and brine, followed by drying and solvent removal furnished the required product which was subjected to TFA-mediated BOC deprotection using 10 mL of 1:1 TFA-CH2CI2. This material was used for derivatizing doxorubicin.]<br>
This partially-purified material was used as such for coupling to acetylene-containing dextran as follows. Acetylene-added dextran (0.1 mL of 3.35 mM) was reacted with 2 mg (1.44 umol; 57-fold molar excess w.r.t to dextran) of doxorubicin-azide, incorporating an acid-cleavable hydrazone, 0.05 molar equiv of cupric sulfate (w.r.t. doxorubicin azide), and 0.5 molar equiv of sodium ascorbate (w.r.t. doxorubicin azide), and stirred overnight at ambient temperature. Reaction pH was maintained at ~ 6.7. The product was purified by 3 successive UF-DF using 10K MWCO centrifugal filter. The product was lyophilized to obtain 13.5 mg of doxorubicin-derivatized dextran. The doxorubicin substitution was determined to be 8.2 per dextran.<br>

In a similar fashion, the dextran derivative of Example 9 is reacted with the azido-SN38 derivative of Examples 6 or 7 to obtain the corresponding dextran conjugates.

Example 11: Coupling of any dextran derivative of Example 10 with a thiol-containing material incorporating a recognition moiety<br>
The reaction is done by coupling a maleimide-appended dextran of Example 10 with 5.4 equivalent of the recognition moiety-incorporated, thiol-containing peptide in 75 mM sodium acetate-1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5, for 1 hr. For pretargeting, prototypical peptide in this regard is Ac-Cys-(AA)„-Lys(HSG)-NH2, wherein AA is an amino acid, and n is an integer from 1-20, preferably 1-3. One of the amino acids represented by 'AA' can be lysine with HSG substituted on the lysine side chain amino group, thereby making the peptide a bis-HSG-containing peptide. The substitution of the N-terminal cysteine can be a chelator such as benzyl-DTPA, instead of acyl, for determining by metal-binding assays the number of peptides attached to the polymer. For DNL coupling, the peptide is cysteine-containing anchoring domain ('AD') peptide, such as illustrated in paragraph 0051. The other recognition moieties described in paragraph 0014 are also useful in this reaction after suitable prior derivatization of the same to possess a thiol group. The product is purified by ultrafiltration-diafiltration, followed by centrifuged size-exclusion column chromatography using non-EDTA buffer. Using an HSG-incorporated peptide, which further contains a metal chelator, metal-binding assay gives a chelator content of 2.5 per dextran. This suggests that at least 2.5 mole per mole of dextran is accessible for reaction with thiol-containing material. A test labeling with In- 111 acetate is done, and the material is purified by size-exclusion chromatography. HPLC analysis of the radiolabeled material as well as that of the material complexed with anti-HSG antibody (murine 679) shows complete complexation, as revealed by the shift of the SE HPLC peak due to In-111-dextran to a peak due to the higher MW of the dextran:679 antibody complex. The unlabeled material is also shown to be complexed with murine 679 antibody, as the broad size-exclusion HPLC peak due to dextran derivative is shifted to a relatively sharper and faster eluting peak, indicating complexation with murine 679 antibody. The conjugation to HSG-containing peptide is given in Scheme-9.<br>

Example 12: Derivatizations of polyglutamic acid<br>
Poly-L-glutamic acid (PG) is reacted with EDC and propargylamine. The product, acetylene-added PG is then purified by repeated ultrafiltration-diafiltration. The acetylene content is estimated by back-titration of the underivatized carboxylic acid groups. The acetylene-appended PG is sequentially derivatized with the maleimide-containing amino compound of Example 8 by EDC-mediated coupling to COOH groups of PG, followed by acetylene-azide coupling using azide-derivatized doxorubicin of Examples 3 or 4, or azide-derivatized SN-38 of Examples 5, 6, or 7. The respective product is purified by ultrafiltration-diafiltration. When the azide-drug is of Example 6 or 7, a further deprotection of BOC and MMT groups is also carried out with hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid, as described in paragraph 0084. Finally, the material is derivatized with a thiol-containing recognition-moiety, as described in Example 11. PGs with molecular weights in the ranges of 750-5000, 3000-15,000,15,000-50,000, and 50,000-100,000 are used in this context.<br>
