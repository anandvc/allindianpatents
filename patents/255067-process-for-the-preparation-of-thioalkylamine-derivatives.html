				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of known thio-alkylamine derivatives.<br>
Because of their chemical structure thioalkylamine derivatives can be divided into two groups, thiols and sulphides. For the preparation of both classes the methods discussed below have been described.<br>
A first method for the preparation of thiols is based on the hydrolytic cleavage of thiazoline or thiazolidinone derivatives (cf. e.g. J. Med. Chem. 1965, 8, 762; JP 59-231064, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1967.3637). As thiazoline or thiazohdinone derivatives have to be prepared first via several reaction steps the overall yield of this method is very low.<br>
Thiols can be obtained furthermore by a process comprising reacting sulphates of amino alcohols with ammonium sulphide (cf. e.g. Nihon Kagaku Kaishi 1979. 149). This method requires long reactions times in a sealed reaction vessel, which causes high costs because of the required production plants having low productivity.<br>
The reaction of oxazoline- or oxazolidinone derivatives with thiols is a method for the preparation of sulphides (cf. e.g. J. Org. Chem. 1992. 57, 6257; J. Med. Chem. 1984. 27, 1354). A hydrolytic process is required to obtain reaction products as amides according to this method. However, no reaction is observed, if the oxazoli-dine ring of the starting compounds is e.g. alkyl substituted. Furthermore, only aromatic sulphides can be prepared using this method because of the acidity of the mercaptans.<br>
The hydrolytic cleavage of amides, which can be obtained by reaction of amino alcohols with mercaptans in the presence of carboxylic acids, also furnishes sulphides (cf. e.g. DE-OS 14 93 534). This method has to be carried out at high temperature and under pressure using long reaction times and is therefore restricted to the<br><br>
synthesis of sulphides. Additionally a hydrolytic step is required to obtain the reaction products from amides.<br>
The reaction of aziridines with sulphur compounds like mercaptans represents a method for preparing of sulphides and thiols (cf. e.g. Tetrahedron 1992, 48, 2359; Tetrahedron Lett. 1983, 24, 2131). High demands on safety requirements have to be made for industrial scale production using this method because highly toxic and possibly instable aziridines have to be prepared and isolated.<br>
A method for the conversion of thioalkylalcohols into thioalkylamines is represented by the Ritter reaction with subsequent hydrolytic cleavage (cf. e.g. DE-OS 20 45 905). This method employs hydrocyanic acid in excess, which must be handled with the utmost caution. In the case that nitriles which can be easily handled are employed the hydrolytic process causes problems.<br>
A further method for the preparation of thioalkylamine derivatives uses as starting material amino alcohols which are reacted with sulphuric acid to give the corresponding esters in a first step (cf. WO 01/23350). After evaporation to dryness this esters are further converted by reaction with mercaptans. The required evaporation after the .the first reaction step causes problems when this process is employed to a large scale production.<br>
US 5507840 describe the first step of the claimed process namely the preparation of amino sulphuric esters using oleum as sulphating agent.<br>
US 2769839 describe the reaction of marcaptohalides with ammonium. However, mercaptohalides are not subject matter of the present invention.<br>

The first step of the reaction according to the invention can be carried out by addition of the amino alcohols of the formula (II) into the oleum. This procedure is preferably carried out with mechanical stirring in that way, that the added amino alcohol does not touch the glass surface of the reaction vessel.<br>
The addition of the amino alcohol of the formula (II) into the oleum is preferably done with cooling to keep the temperature below 150°C, while a temperature range between 80°C and 90°C is particularly preferred. In general a carbonization will not be observed even if higher substituted amino alcohols are employed.<br>
The amino alcohols are applied in liquid form. Solutions with up to 15 % water may also be used.<br>
According to the invention oleum means a solution of sulphur trioxide (SO3) in sulphuric acid. The content of SO3 can be varied in a broad range. In general between 1 % and 70 % SO3 are used. Preferably the reaction is carried out using between 15 % and 60 %, particularly preferably 15 % and 30 %, very particularly preferably 20 % SO3. For example, 40 % oleum means that 100 g of this solution contains 40 g ofSO3.<br>
The reaction temperatures employed to the first step of the reaction according to the invention may be varied over a broad range. In general the reaction is carried out between 50°C and 200°C, preferably between 70°C and 180°C, particularly preferably between 80°C and 130°C.<br>
The first step of the reaction is expediently carried out under atmospheric pressure, although it is also possible to work under reduced or elevated pressure. Particular preference is given to carrying out the reaction under atmospheric pressure.<br>
The reaction time can be different depending on the scale of the reaction and may vary between 10 min and 4 hours.<br>
The first step of the process is carried out in practice by reacting, for example, 1 mol of an amino alcohol of formula (II) with between 0.01 and 6 mol, preferably between 0.05 and 3 mol, particularly preferably between 0.1 and 1 mol, very particularly between 0.2 and 0.8 mol, especially preferably 0.6 mol of SO3, which is applied as solution in sulphuric acid (i.e. oleum, see above).<br>
The sulphuric acid esters of the formula (III) may be isolated. Preferably these esters of formula (III) are used without isolation for the conversion in the second step of the process according to the invention.<br>
The second step of the reaction according to the invention can be carried out by addition of the mercaptans or salts thereof of formula (IV), if as salt, then preferably in form of an aqueous solution of said mercaptan salt, into of the sulphuric acid ester of formula (III). Before this addition the reaction mixture is diluted with water and neutralized with a base. The reaction mixture may be neutralized directly when the reaction is carried out in small scale, for example in laboratory scale. The addition of the mercaptans or salts thereof of formula (IV) is done between 10 min up to 24 h, depending on the scale of the reaction, preferably between 20 min and 12 h, particularly preferably between 30 min and 6 h.<br>
The second step of the process is carried out in the presence of a base. Examples which may be mentioned are: alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)2, alkali metal carbonates or hydrogencarbonates, such as Na2CO3, Li2CO3, K2CO3, Cs2CO3 or NaHCO3 and KHCO3. Preference is given to Na2CO3, KOH, NaOH and NaHCO3, in particular NaOH.<br>
The reaction temperatures employed to the second step of the reaction according to the invention may be varied over a broad range. In general the reaction is carried out between 30°C and 150°C, preferably between 50°C and 120°C, particularly preferably between 60°C and 80°C.<br>
The second step of the reaction is expediently carried out under atmospheric pressure, although it is also possible to work under reduced or elevated pressure. Particular preference is given to carrying out the reaction under atmospheric pressure.<br>
The second step of the reaction according to the invention may be carried out in the presence of a further diluent, where all customary inert organic solvents apply. Preference is given to using optionally halogenated aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum ether, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene or decaline; chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, dichlorethane or trichloroethane; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert.-butyl ether, methyl tert-amyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane or anisole; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, n- or isobutyronirrile or benzo-nitrile; amides, such as N,N-dimethylformarnide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-formanilide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoric triamide; esters, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, or sulphones, such as sulpholane.<br>
The second step of the process is carried out in practice by reacting, for example, 1 mol of an sulphuric acid ester of formula (III) with between 1 and 10 mol, preferably between 1 and 5 mol, particularly preferably between 1 and 3 mol of an<br>
mercaptan or salt thereof of formula (IV) in the presence of a base, to keep the pH value in general between pH 11 and 12.<br>
The end-product can be isolated using standard procedures, e.g. cristallization, chromatography, extraction and distillation.<br>
The process according to the invention is illustrated by the preparation examples given below.<br>
