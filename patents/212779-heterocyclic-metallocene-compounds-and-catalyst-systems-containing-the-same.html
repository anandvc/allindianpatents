The present invention relates to a new class of metallocene compounds, to catalysts containing them and to a process carried out in the presence of said catalysts for the preparation of polymers of alpha-olefins, particularly propylene polymers, having a low degree of crystallinity. The present invention also relates to the ligands for those metallocenes and to a convenient process for their preparation:<br>
Products of propylene homopolymerization can have varying degrees of crystallinity. The type and amount of crystallinity is largely dependent on the microstructure of the polypropylene. Polypropylene having predominantly isotactic or syndiotactic structure is partially crystalline, while polypropylene having predominantly atactic structure is amorphous. Propylene polymers are also known which have a reduced degree of crystallinity and show elastomeric properties. U.S. patent No. 4,335,225, for instance, discloses a fractionable, elastic polypropylene, having an isotactic content of 55% or less, which contain a diethyl ether-soluble fraction with an isotactic crystalline content of about 0.5-5% by weight This polypropylene is prepared with a catalyst based on a tetraalkyl zirconium supported on a metal oxide. However, the elastomeric polypropylenes of this type, due to the fact that the catalyst systems which are used for their preparation have different catalytic sites, are endowed with a wide distribution of molecular weights which has a negative impact on their properties.<br>
Metallocene catalysts have recently been used in the polymerization reaction of olefins. Operating in the presence of these catalysts, polymers characterized by a narrow molecular weight distribution and having structural characteristics of interest have been obtained. By polymerizing propylene in the presence of metallocene catalysts, amorphous or highly crystalline polypropylenes can be obtained depending on the metallocene used<br>
Certain metallocene catalysts are also known that can produce partially crystalline elastomeric polypropylene. International application WO 95/25757, for instance, describes unbridged metallocene catalysts that can produce isotactic-atactic stereoblock polypropylenes having elastomeric thermoplastic properties. Despite the homogeneity in molecular weight distribution, the tacticity distribution of these polymers is not homogeneous. Moreover, the activity is low. U. Dietrich et aL in "J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999,121, 4348-4355" describe metallocene catalysts that are able to produce thermoplastic elastic polypropylenes.<br><br>
More recently, heterocyclic metallocene compounds have been used in the polymerization of alpha-olefins. International application WO 98/22486 discloses a class of metallocenes containing a cyclopentadienyl radical directly coordinating the central metal atom, to which are fused one or more rings containing at least one heteroatom. These metallocenes, in combination with a suitable cocatalyst, are used in the polymerization of olefins such as propylene. The working examples relate to the preparation of highly stereoregular polypropylene. It would be desirable to provide a novel class of metallocenes which, when used in catalysts for the polymerization of olefins, in particular propylene, are capable of yielding polymers endowed with high molecular weights, narrow molecular weight distribution and a reduced degree of crystaUinity. fi would be most desirable to provide metallocene catalysts that can produce those polymers with high activity, such that the amount of catalyst remaining in the formed polymer is minimized.<br>
A novel class of metallocene compounds has now been unexpectedly found, which achieves the above and other results.<br>
According to a first aspect the present invention provides a metallocene compound of general formula (T):<br>

International patent application WO 99/40129.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can also be supported on an inert carrier. This is achieved<br>
by depositing the metallocene compound (A) or the product of the reaction thereof with the<br>
component (B), or the component (B) and then the metallocene compound (A) on supports such<br>
as, for example, silica, alumina, magnesium halides, styrene/divinylbenzene copolymers,<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene. The supportation process is carried out in an inert solvent such as<br>
hydrocarbon for example toluene, hexane, pentane or propane and at a temperature rangeing<br>
from 0°C to 100°C, preferably the process is carried out at room temperature.<br>
A suitable class of supports which can be used is that constituted by porous organic supports<br>

magnesium halides such as those described in International application WO 95/32995.<br>
The solid compound thus obtained,  in combination with the further addition of the<br>
alkyialuminium compound either as such or prereacted with water if necessary, can be usefully<br>
employed in the gas-phase polymerization.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention a process is provided for the<br>
preparation of polymers of alpha-olefins comprising contacting one or more alpha-olefins<br>
under polymerization conditions with a catalyst comprising the product obtainable by<br>
contacting:<br>
(A)      a metallocene compound of formula (T)<br>
LGZMXp	(I)<br>
wherein L, Z, M, X, and p has been defined above and G is a moiety of formula (EI):<br><br><br>
wherein R6, R7, R8 and R9, which may be the same as or different from each other, are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a Ci-Quralkyl, C3-C20-cycloalkyl, C2-C20-alkenyl,   C6-C20-aryl*   C7-C2(ralkylaryl,   Cr^o-arylalkyl  radical,   optionally containing    heteroatams belonging to groups 13-17 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, R6 and R7 and/or R8 and R9 can form a ring comprising from 3 to 8 atoms, winch, can bear substitoents; with the proviso that R is different fromR and when R is a tert-butyl radical R8 is not hydrogen; and (B)      an alumoxane and/or a compound capable oT forming an aDcyl metallocene cation. Preferably in the metallocene compound of formula (T) G is a moiety of formula (Hla) or (IV), more preferably G is a moiety selected from the compound of formula (Hla), (TVB), (Wc) or (IVd).<br>
The process for the polymerization of olefins according to the invention can be carried out in the liquid phase in the presence or absence of an inert hydrocarbon solvent, or in the gas phase. The hydrocarbon solvent can either be aromatic such as toluene, or aliphatic such as propane, hexane, heptane, isobutane or cyclohexane.<br>
The polymerization temperature is generally comprised between -100°C and +100°C and, particularly between 10°C and +90°C. The polymerization pressure is generally comprised between 0,5 and 100 bar.<br>
The lower the polymerization temperature, the higher are the resulting molecular weights of the polymers obtained.<br>
The polymerization yields depend on the purity of the metallocene compound of the catalyst The metallocene compounds obtained by the process of the invention can therefore be used as such or can be subjected to purification treatments.<br>
The components of the catalyst can be brought into contact with each other before the polymerization. The pre-contact concentrations are generally between 0.1 and 10 mol/1 for the metallocene component (A), while they are generally between 2 and 10"8 mol/1 for the component (B). The pre-contact is generally effected in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent<br><br>
and, if appropriate, of small quantities of monomer. In the pre-contact it is also possible to use a non-polymerizable olefin such as isobutene, 2-butene and the like.<br>
Further, the molecular weights of the polymer obtained, in particular of propylene homo or polymers, 1-butene polymers or ethylene homo or copolymers, are distributed over relatively limited ranges. The molecular weight distribution can be represented by the ratio Mw/Mn which, for the present polymers, is generally lower than 4, preferably lower than 3.5 and, more preferably, lower than 3.<br>
The molecular weight distribution can be varied by using mixtures of different metallocene<br>
compounds or by carrying out the polymerization in several stages which differ as to the<br>
polymerization temperature and/or the concentrations of the molecular weight regulators.<br>
One of the preferred alpha-olefins to be used in the polymerization process of the present<br>
invention is propylene. When propylene is polymerized and G is a moiety selected from the<br>
compound of formula (ma) and (Wb) a propylene polymer having a melting enthalpy 
and triads (mm) satisfying the relation: 30 
moiety selected from the compound of formula (IVc), (IVd) the polymer obtained generally<br>
have a catalyst activity and/or intrinsic viscosity higher than those obtained with similar<br>
catalyst used in the prior art. For example in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 10786-10787<br>
isopropylidene{      (3-tertbutytoyclopentadienyl)-7^	1,2-b:4,3-<br>
b']-dithiophene) }zirconium dichloride was used for polymerizing propylene, with a catalyst activity of only 13 Kgfrnmol oath. The polymers obtained generally have the triads (mm) satisfying the relation: 70 
More interesting propylene polymers obtainable with the process described above are propylene polymer having the following characteristics:<br>
-	triads (mm) satisfying the relation 30 
-	melting enthalpy (AH) 
The molecular weights of the above said propylene polymers can be quite high. Thus, the intrinsic viscosity can reach values of greater than 0.7 dl/g, preferably greater than 1 dl/g, more<br><br>

-	Strength at bi^ (ASTM D638) fiom W^^^<br>
The microstructures of polypropilene obtained by the process of the present invention, cover a range of commercial copolymers such as elastomeric, flexible, and random-like polypropylene, but with the difference that the melting point of the polypropylene of the present invention is always higher than the cited copolymer. Thus polypropylene of the present invention can easily replace these more expensive copolymers. The polymerization reaction of propylene acconding to the invention can be carried out in the presence of ethylene or of a C4-C10 alpha-olefin comonomer. Thus a further aspect of the present invention is a propylene copolymer containing from 0.1 to 30% by moles, preferably fiom 0.1 to 20% by moles, more preferably from 0.1 to 10% by moles, even more preferably from 0.1 to 5% by moles of units deriving fiom an olefin of formula CHr=CHR', R' being hydrogen, a C2-C20-alkyl or a Cg-Cir-ayl group, said propylene copolymer having the following characteristics:<br>

In the case of ethylene/propylene copolymers, the product of the reactivity ratios ri as, wherein ri<br>
is the reactivity ratio of propylene anil T2 that of ethylene, is calculated according to the following<br><br>
formula:<br>

POLYMERIZATION EXAMPLES<br>
General procedures<br>
The cocatalyst methylalumoxane (MAO) was a commercial product which was used as<br>
received (Witco AG, 10 %wt/vol toluene solution, 1.7 M in Al). The catalyst mixture was<br>
prepared by dissolving the desired amount of the metallocene with the proper amount of the<br>
MAO solution, obtaining a solution which was stirred for 10 min at ambient temperature<br>
before being injected into the autoclave.<br>
Polymerization examples 1-33 propylene polymerization<br>
1 mmol of Al(z-Bu)3 (as a 1M solution in hexane) and 290 g of propylene were charged at<br>
room temperature in a 1-L jacketed stainless-steel autoclave, equipped with magnetically<br>
driven stirrer and a 35-mL stainless-steel vial, connected to a thermostat for temperature<br>
control, previously purified by washing with an Al(i-Bu)3 solution in hexanes and dried at<br>
50°C in a stream of propene. The autoclave was then thermostatted at 2 °C below the<br>
polymerization temperature, and then the toluene solution containing the catalyst/cocatalyst<br>
mixture was injected in the autoclave by means of nitrogen pressure through the stainless-steel<br>
vial, the temperature rapidly raised to the polymerization temperature and the polymerization<br>
carried out at constant temperature for 1 hour. After venting the unreacted monomer and<br>
cooling the reactor to room temperature, the polymer was dried under reduced pressure at 60<br>
°C. The polymerization conditions and the characterization data of the obtained polymers are<br>
reported in Table 1.<br>
Polymerization example 34 propylene/butene copolvmerization<br>
Operating as in the case of propylene homopolymerizations, 1 mmol of Al(z-Bu)3 (as a 1M<br>
solution in hexane), 160 g of propylene and 154 g of 1-butene were charged at room<br><br>
temperature in the 1-L jacketed stainless-steel autoclave, thermostatted at 58 °C, in order to have a 50/50 mol% in the liquid phase, and then the toluene solution containing the catalyst/cocatalyst mixture (0.5 mg of C-20, 0.45 mmol of MAO, in 3 mL of toluene) was injected in the autoclave by means of nitrogen pressure through the stainless-steel vial, the temperature rapidly raised to the polymerization temperature and the polymerization carried out at constant temperature for 1 hour. 26.5 g of essentially amorphous polymer were recovered, which has LV. = 2.29 dL/g, Tg = -13.6 °C, and butene = 27.7 wt% (22.3 mol%). Polymerization example 35 propylene/ethylene copolvmerization<br>
Operating as in the case of propylene homopolymerizations, 1 mmol of Al(/-Bu)3 (as a 1M solution in hexane), propylene and ethylene were charged at room temperature in the 1-L jacketed stainless-steel autoclave, thermostatted at 58 °C, in order to have a liquid phase composition of 288 g propylene and 1.5 g ethylene (0.42 %wt) in the liquid phase, and then the toluene solution containing the catalyst/cocatalyst mixture (0.3 mg of C-20, 0.27 mmol of MAO, in 3 mL of toluene) was injected in the autoclave by means of nitrogen pressure through the stainless-steel vial, the temperature rapidly raised to the polymerization temperature and the polymerization carried out at constant temperature and pressure (25 bar-g) by feeding ethylene (13.3 g total absorption) for 1 hour. 52.7 g of essentially amorphous polymer were recovered, which has IV. = 1.23 dL/g, and ethylene = 6.3 wt% (9.2 mol%). Polymerization example 36 propylene polymerization with supported catalyst a) Preparation of the supported catalyst<br>
The apparatus used for the supportation is a glass cylindrical vessel mechanically stirred in order to allow a good mixing between the carrier and the catalytic solution during the impregnation operation. 6 g of a porous polyethylene having LV. 21 dL/g, mean Particle size 386 \mx and porosity 50,9 % VN (L07 cc/g) was loaded into the vessel and mechanically suspended under nitrogen flow. The catalytic solution was prepared by dissolving 24 mg of C-20 in 12 mL of a MAO solution (WTTCO , lOOg/L in toluene). Due to the limited porosity of the carrier die liquid is dropped onto the solid until the incipient wetness condition is reached. At this point the solvent is evaporated off under vacuum. All the operations are carried out at room temperature. The catalytic solution is then added to the carrier step by step. The final catalyst appears as a pink-violet free flowing solid with the following composition: Al 5.0%w and Zr 0.0705%w (Al/Zr molar ratio 240).<br><br>
b) Polymerization<br>
A 4L stainless-steel reactor, equipped with a blade turbine magnetic stirrer, pressure indicator, temperature indicator and a thermosetting jacket, was used. A batch polymerization was carried with the following procedure. 1200 g of liquid monomer was loaded at 30 °C, followed by 3 ml of a TDBA solution 100 g/1 in hexane used as a scavenger. The polymerization was started by injecting 305 mg of the catalyst into the autoclave at 30°C, by means of nitrogen overpressure, then the temperature was raised up to 60°C in 10 minutes and maintained for 1 hour. The polymerization was stopped by venting and cooling the reactor. No significant fouling was observed. The product obtained was collected and dried in an oven flushed with nitrogen at 70°C for 3 hours. 360 g of polymer- was obtained with a good morphology having an LV. of 1.94 dL/g. The activity of the catalyst was 1.2 kgPP/g cat supp.h, corresponding to 1.7ton PP/gZrix. d) Physical characterization<br>

Polymerization examples 37-59 ethylene/propylene polymerization The Ethylen Propylene mixtures were prepared in a 5 L steel cylinder, filled with quantities of the two gases small enough to prevent their condensation. The composition of the gaseous mixture in the cylinder was controlled through GC analysis. The copolymerizations were carried out at 50 °C in a 250 mL glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an AlHhn condenser, a thermometer and a pipe for monomers feeding, and kept in a thermostatic bath. First, 100 mL of toluene and 3.5 mmol of TTOAO solution were introduced into the nitrogen-purged reactor. At the polymerization temperature, the nitrogen was removed and replaced with the comonomers mixture, with a flow rate of 1.5 L/min. When the equilibrium pressure (1.1 atm of total pressure) was reached, 3.5 )imol of the metallocene dissolved in 5 mL of hexane in the presence of a 35 |xmol of TIOA (35 jiL of solution 1 M), was added to start the polymerization. During the reaction, the temperature was kept within 50 ± 1 °C. After 15 min the polymerization was quenched by adding 1 mL of methanol, and the copolymer was precipitated with 300 mL of methanol acidified with HC1, filtered, washed and dried overnight in vacuo at 50 °C. Polymerization results characterization and reactivity ratios rl and r2 of ethylene/propylene copolymers are reported in tables 3,4 and 5. Polymerization example 60 ethylene polymerization with supported catalyst A 4L stainless-steel reactor, equipped with a blade turbine magnetic stirrer, pressure indicator, temperature indicator, feed line for monomer equipped with a thermal-mass flowmeter for the<br><br>
measure of the ethylene uptake and a thermosetting jacket, was used. A batch polymerization was carried out with the following procedure. 1600 ml of liquid propane is loaded into the reactor at 30°C, followed by 2.5 mmoles of tri-isobutylaluminum as the scavenger. The autoclave was pressurized with an ethylene partial pressure of 5 bar. The polymerization was started by injecting 162 mg of the catalyst prepared in example 37 a) into the autoclave at 30°C, by means of nitrogen overpressure. A prepolymerization step was carried out at 30°C for 30 minutes. After this time the reactor temperature was incresaed up to 75°C and the ethylene partial pressure also was increased to 10 bar. The polymerization was stopped after 2 hours by venting and cooling the reactor. The polymer discharged was dried in an oven flushed with nitrogen at 70°C for 3 hours. 90 g of polymer was obtained with an intrinsic viscosity of 4.29 dL/g and a melting temperature of 141.4° C.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
