Patent Document 4 discloses compounds, for example, shown below, which<br>
are demonstrated to be valuable as antihypertensives.<br><br>
However, none of the above-mentioned Patent Documents 1 to 4 mentions<br>
activity for bone metabolic diseases and inflammation, and therefore the purposes of<br>
the uses of such compounds are quite different from those of the present invention.<br><br>
4<br>
Furthermore, only the structures have been known for the compounds shown below.<br>
and the uses thereof are not known at all.<br><br>
In general, in normal bone metabolism, bone resorption by osteoclasts is<br>
balanced with bone formation by osteoblasts to maintain homeostasis. It is thought<br>
that bone metabolic diseases are caused when the balance between the bone<br>
resorption and the bone formation is deteriorated. Bones retain about 99% of the<br>
total calcium in a living body and play an important role for maintaining a constant<br>
blood calcium concentration by bone formation and bone resorption. If the<br>
osteoclasts which are mainly responsible for bone resorption are abnormally formed<br>
or activated, bone resorption is accelerated to increase the blood calcium<br>
concentration, and thereby bone metabolic diseases, such as hypercalcemia, are<br>
caused.<br><br>
5<br>
It is known that bone metastasis of cancer causes abnormal secretion of<br>
cytokines resulting in development of hypercalcemia. In this process, bone<br>
resorption by osteoclasts is accelerated, so that the blood calcium concentration is<br>
increased (Non-Patent Document 1). Prognosis of cancer patients accompanied by<br>
cancerous hypercalcemia is generally poor.<br>
Moreover, in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and the like, abnormal<br>
formation or activation of osteoclasts is known as one of main causes of various<br>
symptoms in bones and joints (Non-Patent Document 2). Patients with rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis, and the like suffer from severe pain, which brings<br>
considerable disadvantages to the lives of the patients.<br>
Furthermore, when the balance between bone resorption and bone formation<br>
continuously inclines toward the bone resorption due to a decrease in secretion of<br>
female hormones after menopause or due to ageing, bone density is lowered and<br>
osteoporosis is developed. Also in this case, osteoclasts are also responsible for the<br>
bone resorption.<br>
When aged patients with a high risk of osteoporosis suffer fractures, a<br>
possibility of becoming bedridden is high, which is a social problem (Non-Patent<br>
Document 3).<br>
Conventionally, for these states of diseases, hormone replacement therapy<br>
using estrogen or the like has been conducted or a therapeutic agent such as a<br>
bisphosphonate or a calcitonin for suppressing the activity of osteoclasts has been<br>
administered (Non-Patent Document 4). However, none of these existing agents are<br>
satisfactory agents for essentially treating hypercalcemia or bone metabolic diseases,<br>
and thereby the development of agents having high therapeutic efficacy is desired.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide drugs which arc excellent as<br>
agents for improving, prophylaxis, or treatment of osteoporosis, inflammation,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, hypercalcemia, and the like.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies on drugs having<br>
excellent blood calcium concentration-decreasing activity and bone mass decrease-<br>
suppressing activity and have found the fact that drugs comprising a compound<br>

the present invention) are low in toxicity, have excellent bone resorption-suppressing<br>
activity and blood calcium concentration-decreasing activity and bone mass<br>
decrease-suppressing activity associated therewith , and are valuable for prophylaxis<br>
or treatment of bone metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, bone<br>
metastasis of cancer, periodontal disease, bone Paget's disease, and osteoarthritis.<br><br>

The term "bone metabolic disease" in the present invention means diseases<br>
characterized by a substantial decrease in bone mass or an increase in blood calcium<br>
concentration and diseases that require suppression of the bone resorption or the rate<br>
of bone resorption for their prophylaxis or treatment.<br>
Examples of such bone metabolic disease include osteoporosis, hypercalcemia,<br>
bone metastasis of cancer, periodontal diseases, bone Paget's disease, and<br>
osteoarthrosis.<br>
The above term "osteoporosis" means a systemic disease in which, due to a<br>
decrease in bone mass, the bone microarchitecture is disrupted and the mechanical<br>
strength of bone is reduced, resulting in an increased risk of fractures. Examples of<br>
osteoporosis include postmenopausal osteoporosis, senile osteoporosis, secondary<br>
osteoporosis caused by steroid or immunosuppressive agent use, osteoclasis or<br>
osteopenia due to rheumatoid arthritis, and osteopenia due to artificial joint<br>
replacement.<br>
The above term "treatment" means to cure or improve a disease or a symptom<br>
or to suppress a symptom.<br>
The above term "significantly decrease blood calcium concentration"<br>
generally means to decrease the blood calcium concentration that is strictly<br>
maintained at a constant value to a level lower than a general level. The decrease<br>
ratio is preferably 0.1% or more, more preferably 0.5% or more, still more preferably<br>
1% or more, and particularly more preferably 5% or more.<br>

readily converted to the functional groups. In such a case, desired compounds can<br>
be obtained by removing the protecting groups according to need.<br>
Examples of such functional groups include a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl<br>
group, a carbonyl group, and an amino group. Protecting groups for these functional<br>

n-Butyllithium (7.2 raL, 1.56 M hexane solution, 11.2 mmol) was added to a<br>
solution in THF (25 mL) of l-bromo-4-(dimethoxymethyl)benzene (2.29 g, 9.91<br>

then cyclopentanone (1.34 mL, 15.1 mmol) was added thereto. The resulting<br>
mixture was heated to room temperature and then stirred for 1 hour. The reaction<br>
was terminated by adding a saturated ammonium chloride aqueous solution, and an<br>
extraction with ethyl acetate was conducted three times. The resulting organic<br>
layers were washed with water and saturated brine and then dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated, and the resulting residue was<br>
purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane : ethyl acetate, 5:1. v/v) to<br>
give an oily compound. Trifluoroacetic acid (9 mL) was added to a<br>
dichloromethane-water (9.1 mL, 100:1, v/v) mixture solution containing the resulting<br>
oily compound at room temperature, and the mixture was continuously stirred for 20<br>
minutes. The solvent was evaporated, and the resulting residue was purified by<br>
silica gel column chromatography (hexane : ethyl acetate, 10:1, v/v) to give 1.18 g of<br>
the title compound (light brown crystalline solid, yield: 90%).<br>

(Test Example 1) Evaluation of blood calcium concentration-decreasing<br>
activity<br>
The blood calcium concentration in a living body is strictly controlled and<br>
constantly maintained by intestinal absorption and urinary excretion and release<br>
(bone resorption) and adhesion (bone formation) in bone tissues. In an immature rat,<br>
which is very active in bone resorption and bone formation, the blood calcium<br>
concentration is significantly decreased by strongly suppressing bone resorption.<br>
The bone resorption-suppressing activity of compounds according to the present<br>
invention was evaluated by administering the compounds to immature rats and<br>
observing decreases in blood calcium concentration as an index of the activity.<br>
The test was conducted using 4-week old male Wistar rats fasted for 12 to 24<br>
hours. Each compound to be tested was suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose (MC).<br>
The suspension was orally administered to the rats at a dose of 5 mT/kg. Similarly,<br>
rats of a normal control group were administered with 0.5% MC alone. Then, blood<br>
was drawn from rat jugular vein under ether anesthesia 6 hours after the<br>
administration of each test compound or 0.5% MC. The blood was immediately<br>
centrifuged (10000 rpm, 5 minutes) at room temperature to separate serum. The<br>
calcium concentration of each serum was measured by an autoanalyzer (JEOL, JCA-<br>
BM2250). Five rats were used for each test group.<br>
The test results are shown in Table 5 below. The evaluation was conducted<br>
by a comparative test with the normal control group and based on the serum calcium<br>
concentration-decreasing rate (%) calculated according to the following formula:<br><br>
206<br>
Serum calcium concentration-decreasing rate (%) = ([serum calcium concentration in<br>
normal control group] - [serum calcium concentration in test compound<br>
administration group]/[serum calcium concentration in normal control group]) x 100.<br>
(Table 5)<br><br>

Example 11	20	30.6<br>
Example 14	10	33.2<br>
Example 16	10	27.2<br>
In general, a constant blood calcium concentration should be strictly<br>
maintained, but the blood calcium concentrations were decreased by administering<br>
the compounds according to the present invention. This result suggests that the<br>
blood calcium concentration-decreasing activity of the compounds according to the<br>
present invention is high.<br>
(Test Example 2) Evaluation of bone density decrease-suppressing activity<br>
and anti-arthritic activity<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis, not only swelling and pain caused by arthritis but also<br>
systemic bone mass decrease and articular destruction caused by a significant<br>
increase in bone resorption are observed. The effects of the compounds according<br>
to the present invention in suppressing the bone mass decrease and the paw volume<br>
increase caused by arthritis were evaluated using adjuvant arthritis model rats, which<br>
exhibit arthritis similar to human rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The test was conducted using 8-week old female Lewis rats. Mycobacterium<br>
butyricum cells which were killed by heat were ground in an agate mortar, suspended<br>
in liquid paraffin sterilized by dry heat to a concentration of 2 mg/mL, and treated<br><br>
207<br>
with ultrasound to prepare an adjuvant. Under ether anesthesia, rats in a control<br>
group other than a normal control group and rats in a test compound administration<br>
group were intradermally injected with 0.05 mL of this adjuvant each time (1.0<br>
mL/rat in total) at two portions of the base of the tail. Starting from 14 days after<br>
the injection of the adjuvant, each rat was orally administered with 5 mL/kg of a test<br>
compound suspended in 0.5% MC once a day for 7 days. Similarly, the rats of the<br>
control group were administered with 0.5% MC alone. On the 21 st day after the<br>
adjuvant injection, hind paw volumes were measured by using a paw edema volume<br>
determining device (MUROMACHI KIKAI, TK-101 CMP). Then, the thighbone<br>
was biopsied. The thighbone was, after removing soft tissues, sufficiently fixed,<br>
dehydrated, and dried using ethanol. The bone density of the thighbone was<br>
measured with a bone density analyzer (Aloka, DOS-600 EX-MR). Five rats were<br>
used for each test group.<br>
The test results are shown in Table 6 below.<br>
The evaluation was conducted by comparison tests with the normal control group<br>
and the control group and based on the bone density decrease-suppressing rate (%)<br>
and the paw edema-suppressing rate (%) calculated according to the following<br>
formulae:<br>
Bone density decrease-suppressing rate (%) = (1-([thighbone bone density in normal<br>
control group] - [thighbone bone density in test compound administration<br>
group])/[thighbone bone density in normal control group] - [thighbone bone density<br>
in control group])) x 100<br>
Paw edema-suppressing rate (%) = (l-([paw volume of test compound administration<br>
group] - [paw volume in normal control group])/[paw volume in control group] -<br>
[paw volume in normal control group])) x 100 ;<br><br>

The bone density decrease and the paw volume increase were significantly<br>
suppressed by administering the compounds according to the present invention.<br>
Thus, advantageous effects of the compounds according to the present invention as<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic drugs for bone metabolic diseases and inflammation were<br>
confirmed.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The drugs according to the present invention have blood calcium<br>
concentration-decreasing effect and bone mass decrease-suppressing effect due to<br>
their excellent bone resorption-suppressing effects and are low in toxicity.<br>
Therefore, the drugs are useful as prophylactic or therapeutic drugs for bone<br>
metabolic diseases, for example, osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, bone metastasis of<br>
cancer, periodontal disease, bone Paget's disease, and osteoarthrosis, in mammals<br>
(such as human, ape, dog, cat, horse, and hog, in particular, human).<br><br>
