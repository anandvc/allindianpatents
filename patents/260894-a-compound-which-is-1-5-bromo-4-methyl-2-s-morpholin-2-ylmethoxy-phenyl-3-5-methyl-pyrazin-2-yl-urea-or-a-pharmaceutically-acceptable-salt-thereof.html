HETEROARYL UREA DERIVATIVES USEFUL FOR INHIBITING CHK1<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds<br>
useful for inhibiting enzymes that maintain and repair<br>
the integrity of genetic material. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to a series of aryl- and<br>
heteroaryl-substituted urea compounds, methods of making<br>
the compounds, and their use as therapeutic agents, for<br>
example, in treating cancer and other diseases<br>
characterized by defects in deoxyribonucleic acid <dna></dna>
replication, chromosome segregation, or cell division.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A large variety of diseases, conditions, and<br>
disorders (hereinafter "indications") are characterized<br>
as involving aberrantly proliferating cells. As used<br>
herein, "aberrantly proliferating cells" (or "aberrant<br>
cell proliferation") means cell proliferation that<br>
deviates from the normal, proper, or expected course.<br>
For example, aberrant cell proliferation includes<br>
inappropriate proliferation of cells wherein DNA or other<br>
cellular components have become damaged or defective.<br>
Aberrant cell proliferation also characterizes clinical<br>
indications caused by, mediated by, or resulting in<br>
inappropriately high levels of cell division,<br>
inappropriately low levels of cell death (e.g.,<br>
apoptosis), or both. Such indications can be<br>
characterized, for example, by single or multiple local<br>
abnormal proliferations of cells, groups of cells or<br><br>
tissue(s), and include cancerous (benign or malignant)<br>
and noncancerous indications.<br>
By definition, all cancers (benign and<br>
malignant) involve some form of aberrant cell<br>
proliferation. Some noncancerous indications also<br>
involve aberrant cell proliferation. Examples of<br>
noncancerous indications involving aberrant cell<br>
proliferation include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,<br>
vitiligo, Wegener's granulomatosis, and systemic lupus.<br>
One approach to treating indications involving<br>
aberrantly proliferating cells involves the use of DNA<br>
damaging agents. These agents are designed to kill<br>
aberrantly proliferating cells by disrupting vital<br>
cellular processes such as DNA metabolism, DNA synthesis,<br>
DNA transcription, and microtubule spindle formation.<br>
They also can operate, for example, by introducing<br>
lesions into DNA that perturb chromosomal structural<br>
integrity. DNA damaging agents are designed and<br>
administered in ways that attempt to induce maximum<br>
damage and consequent cell death in aberrantly<br>
proliferating cells with a minimum damage to normal,<br>
healthy cells.<br>
A large variety of DNA damaging agents has been developed to date, including chemotherapeutics and<br>
radiation, and others are in development. Unfortunately,<br>
the effectiveness of DNA damaging agents in treating<br>
conditions involving aberrant cell proliferation has been<br>
less than desired, particularly in the treatment of<br>
cancer. The selectivity of such agents for aberrantly<br>
proliferating cells over healthy cells (sometimes<br>
referred to as the therapeutic index) often is marginal.<br>
Moreover, all cells have sensing and repair<br>
mechanisms that can work at cross purposes to DNA<br><br>
damaging agents. Such sensing mechanisms, called cell<br>
cycle checkpoints, help to maintain the order of the<br>
various cell replication stages and to ensure that each<br>
step is executed with high fidelity (Hartwell et al.,<br>
Science, 246:629-634 (1989); Weinert et al., Genes Dev.,<br>
8:652 (1994)). When cells detect DNA damage, including .<br>
damage purposefully induced by DNA damaging agents,<br>
certain signaling pathways activate cell cycle<br>
checkpoints and the cell replication cycle temporarily' '<br>
ceases ("arrests"). This arrest allows cells time to<br>
repair their DNA, often to a degree sufficient to allow<br>
them to continue to survive and proliferate. In the case<br>
of aberrantly proliferating cells, this repair is<br>
unwanted, as it may undermine efforts to induce DNA<br>
damage sufficient to kill such cells.<br>
For example, the chemotherapeutic agent called<br>
GEMZAR™ (gemcitabine, or 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine)<br>
damages DNA by incorporating itself into DNA during<br>
synthesis. Left unrepaired, damaged DNA generally is<br>
rendered incapable of sustaining life. In many targeted<br>
cells, however, cell cycle checkpoints detect the<br>
improperly made (or otherwise damaged) DNA. The<br>
activated cell cycle checkpoints trigger cell cycle<br>
arrest for a time sufficient to allow damaged DNA to be<br>
repaired. This is one way in which aberrantly<br>
proliferating cells are theorized to resist the cell-<br>
killing effect of DNA-damaging agents such as<br>
chemotherapeutics, radiation, and other therapies.<br>
Other DNA-damaging agents cause tumor cells to<br>
arrest in S-phase. Tumor cells have been observed to<br>
resist certain chemotherapeutics simply by arresting in S<br>
phase while the chemotherapeutic agent is being<br>
administered. Then, as soon as the drug is removed, DNA<br><br>
damage is repaired, cell cycle arrest ceases, and the<br>
cells progress through the remainder of the cell cycle<br>
(Shi et al., Cancer Res. 61:1065-1012, 2001). Other<br>
therapeutics cause cell cycle arrest at other<br>
checkpoints, including G1 and G2. Inhibition of various<br>
DNA damage checkpoints therefore is expected to assist in<br>
preventing cells from repairing therapeutically induced<br>
DNA damage and to sensitize targeted cells to DNA<br>
damaging agents. Such sensitization is in turn expected<br>
to increase the therapeutic index of these therapies.<br>
The cell cycle is structurally and<br>
functionally the same in its basic process and mode of<br>
regulation across all eukaryotic species. The mitotic<br>
(somatic) cell cycle consists of four phases: the Gl<br>
(gap) phase, the S (synthesis) phase, the G2 (gap) phase,<br>
and the M (mitosis) phase. The Gl, S, and G2 phases are<br>
collectively referred to as interphase of the cell cycle.<br>
During the Gl phase, biosynthetic activities of the cell<br>
progress at a high rate. The S phase begins when DNA<br>
synthesis starts, and ends when the DNA content of the<br>
nucleus of the cell has been replicated and two identical<br>
sets of chromosomes are formed.<br>
The cell then enters the G2 phase, which<br>
continues until mitosis starts. In mitosis, the<br>
chromosomes pair and separate, two new nuclei form, and<br>
cytokinesis occurs in which the cell splits into two<br>
daughter cells each receiving one nucleus containing one<br>
of the two sets of chromosomes. Cytokinesis terminates<br>
the M phase and marks the beginning of interphase of the<br>
next cell cycle. The sequence in which cell cycle events<br>
proceed is tightly regulated, such that the initiation of<br>
one cell cycle event is dependent on the completion of<br>
the prior cell cycle event. This allows fidelity in the<br><br>
duplication and segregation of genetic material from one<br>
generation of somatic cells to the next.<br>
It has been reported that cell cycle<br>
checkpoints comprise at least three distinct classes of<br>
polypeptides, which act sequentially in response to cell<br>
cycle signals or defects in chromosomal mechanisms (Carr,<br>
Science, 271:314-315, 1996). The first class is a family<br>
of proteins that detect or sense DNA damage or<br>
abnormalities in the cell cycle. These sensors include<br>
Ataxia-telangiectasia Mutated protein (Atm) and Ataxia-<br>
Telangiectasia Rad-related protein (Atr). The second<br>
class of polypeptides amplify and transmit the signal<br>
detected by the detector and is exemplified by Rad53<br>
(Alen et al. Genes Dev. 8:2416-2488, 1994) and Chkl. A<br>
third class of polypeptides includes cell cycle<br>
effectors, such as p53, that mediate a cellular response,<br>
for example, arrest of mitosis and apoptosis.<br>
Much of the current understanding of the<br>
function of cell cycle checkpoints has been derived from<br>
the study of tumor derived cell lines. In many cases,<br>
tumor cells have lost key cell cycle check points<br>
(Hartwell et al., Science 266:1821-28, 1994). It has<br>
been reported that a key step in the evolution of cells<br>
to a neoplastic state is the acquisition of mutations<br>
that inactivate cell cycle checkpoint pathways, such as<br>
those involving p53 (Weinberg, Cell 32:323-330, 1995;<br>
Levine, Cell 83:3234-331, 1997). Loss of these cell<br>
cycle checkpoints results in the replication of tumor<br>
cells despite DNA damage.<br>
Noncancerous tissue, which has intact cell<br>
cycle checkpoints, typically is insulated from temporary<br>
disruption of a single checkpoint pathway. Tumor cells,<br>
however, have defects in pathways controlling cell cycle<br><br>
progression such that the perturbation of additional<br>
checkpoints renders them particularly sensitive to DNA<br>
damaging agents. For example, tumor cells that contain<br>
mutant p53 are defective both in the Gl DNA damage<br>
checkpoint and in the ability to maintain the G2 DNA<br>
damage checkpoint (Bunz et al., Science, 282:1491-501,<br>
1998). Checkpoint inhibitors that target initiation of<br>
the G2 checkpoint or the S phase checkpoint are expected<br>
to further cripple the ability of these tumor cells to<br>
repair DNA damage and, therefore, are candidates to<br>
enhance the therapeutic index of both radiation and<br>
systemic chemotherapy (Gesner, Abstract at SRI<br>
Conference: Protein Phosphorylation and Drug Discovery<br>
World Summit, March 2003).<br>
In the presence of DNA damage or any<br>
impediment to DNA replication, the checkpoint proteins<br>
Atm and Atr initiate a signal transduction pathway<br>
leading to cell cycle arrest. Atm has been shown to play<br>
a role in a DNA damage checkpoint in response to ionizing<br>
radiation (IR). Atr is stimulated by agents that cause<br>
double strand DNA breaks, single strand DNA breaks, and<br>
agents that block DNA radiation.<br>
Chkl is a protein kinase that lies downstream<br>
from Atm and/or Atr in the DNA damage checkpoint signal<br>
transduction pathway (Sanchez et al., Science, 277:1497-<br>
1501, 1997; U.S. Patent No. 6,218,109). In mammalian<br>
cells, Chkl is phosphorylated in response to agents that<br>
cause DNA damage including ionizing radiation (IR),<br>
ultraviolet (UV) light, and hydroxyurea (Sanchez et al.,<br>
supra; Lui et al., Genes Dev., 14:1448-1459, 2000). This<br>
phosphorylation which activates Chkl in mammalian cells<br>
is dependent on Atm (Chen et al., Oncogene, 18:249-256,<br>
1999) and Atr (Lui et al., supra). Furthermore, Chkl has<br><br>
been shown to phosphorylate both weel (O'Connell et al.,<br>
EMBO J., 25:545-554, 1997) and Pdsl (Sanchez et al.,<br>
Science, 286:1166-1171, 1999), gene products known to be<br>
important in cell cycle control.<br>
These studies demonstrate that mammalian Chkl<br>
plays a role in the Atm' dependent DNA damage checkpoint<br>
leading to arrest at S phase. A role for Chkl in the S<br>
phase mammalian cells has recently been elucidated<br>
(Feijoo et al., J. Cell Biol., 254:913-923, 2001; Zhao et<br>
al., PNAS U.S.A, 99:14795-800, 2002; Xiao et al., J Biol<br>
Chem. , 278 (24) .-21767-21773, 2003; Sorensen et al., Cancer<br>
Cell, 3(3):247-58, 2003) highlighting the role of Chkl in<br>
monitoring the integrity of DNA synthesis. Chkl invokes<br>
an S-phase arrest by phosphorylating Cdc25A, which<br>
regulates cyclinA/cdk2 activity (Xiao et al., supra and<br>
Sorensen et al./ supra). Chkl also invokes a G2 arrest<br>
by phosphorylating and inactivating Cdc25C, the dual<br>
specificity phosphatase that normally dephosphorylates<br>
cyclin-B/cdc2 (also known as Cdkl) as cells progress from<br>
G2 into mitosis (Fernery et al., Science, 277:1495-7,<br>
1997; Sanchez et al., supra; Matsuoka et al., Science,<br>
282:1893-1891, 1998; and Blasina et al., Curr. Biol.,<br>
9:1-10, 1999). In both cases, regulation of Cdk activity<br>
induces a cell cycle arrest to prevent cells from<br>
entering mitosis in the presence of DNA damage or<br>
unreplicated DNA.<br>
Additional classes of cell cycle checkpoint<br>
inhibitors operate at either the G1 or G2/M phase. UCN-<br>
01, or 7-hydroxystaurosporine, originally was isolated as<br>
a nonspecific kinase inhibitor having its primary effect<br>
on protein kinase C, but recently has been found to<br>
inhibit the activity of Chkl and abrogate the G2 cell<br>
cycle checkpoint (Shi et al., supra). Thus, because UCN-<br><br><br>
01 is a nonselective Chkl inhibitor, it is toxic to cells<br>
at high doses. At low doses, it nonspecifically inhibits<br>
many cellular kinases and also inhibits the G1 checkpoint<br>
(Tenzer et al., Curr. Med Chem. Anticancer Agents, -3:35-<br>
46, 2003) .<br>
UCN-01 has been used in conjunction with<br>
cancer therapies, such as radiation, the anticancer agent<br>
camptothecin (Tenzer et al., supra), and gemcitabine (Shi<br>
et al., supra), with limited success. In addition, UCN-<br>
01 has been used to potentiate the effects of<br>
temozolomide (TMZ) induced DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in<br>
glioblastoma cells (Hirose et al., Cancer Res., 62:5843-<br>
5849, 2001). In the clinic, UCN-01 is not an effective<br>
chemotherapeutic as expected, possibly due to a failure<br>
in treatment scheduling and a lack of identification of<br>
particular key molecular targets (Grant et al., Drug<br>
Resistance Updates, 6:15-26, 2003). Thus, Mack et al.<br>
report cell cycle-dependent potentiation of cisplatin by<br>
UCN-01 in a cultured nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma cell<br>
line, but do not identify with specificity the key cell<br>
cycle checkpoint (s) targeted by UCN-01. (Mack et al.,<br>
Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 51(4):337-348, 2003).<br>
Several other strategies exist for sensitizing<br>
tumor cells to treatment with cell cycle affecting<br>
chemotherapeutics. For example, administration of 2-<br>
aminopurine abrogates multiple cell cycle checkpoint<br>
mechanisms, such as mimosine-induced G1 arrest or<br>
hydroxyurea-induced S phase arrest, allowing the cell to<br>
progress into and through mitosis (Andreassen et al.,<br>
Proc Natl Acad Sci U.S.A., 86:2212-2216, 1992).<br>
Caffeine, a methylxanthine, has also been used to enhance<br>
cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin<br>
and ionizing radiation, by mediating progression through<br><br>
the G2 checkpoint and thereby inducing cell death.<br>
(Bracey et al., Clin.' Cancer Res., 3:1371-1381, 1997).<br>
However, the dose of caffeine used to accomplish the cell<br>
cycle abrogation exceeds clinically acceptable levels and<br>
is not a viable therapeutic option. Additionally,<br>
antisense nucleotides to Chkl kinase have been used to<br>
increase sensitivity to the topoisoraerase inhibitor<br>
BNP1350 (Yin et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,<br>
255:435-44, 2002), but demonstrate problems typically<br>
associated with antisense treatment and gene therapy.<br>

However, a need remains in the art for<br>
effective and selective inhibitors of Chkl. The present<br>
invention addresses this and other needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to potent<br>
and selective inhibitors of the checkpoint kinase<br>
Chkl that exhibit unexpected properties in<br>
biochemical and/or cell-based assays. The present<br>
Chkl inhibitors are useful in treating indications<br>
involving aberrant cell proliferation, and as<br>
chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing agents in the<br>
treatment of indications related to DNA damage or<br>
lesions in DNA replication.<br>
Therefore, one aspect of the present<br>
invention is to provide compounds of structural<br>
formula (I). Among other things, the compounds are<br>
useful in a method of inhibiting Chkl comprising a<br><br>
step of administering an effective amount of a<br>
compound of structural formula (I) to an individual<br>
in need thereof.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) have a structural<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is halo, C1-3alkyl, CN, or CF3;<br>
R2 is hydrogen, C1-3alkyl, CN, OC1-3alkyl, halo,<br>
or N(Rb)z, wherein Rb, independently, is hydrogen or<br>
C1-3alkyl;<br>
R3 is a 6- or 7-membered saturated<br>
heterocyclic ring containing one ring N-Ra group and<br>
either a second ring N-Ra group, a ring oxygen, or a ring<br>
sulfur, wherein Ra, independently, is hydrogen, Chalkyl,<br>
CH2CN, or CH2CH2CN, and wherein R3 is optionally<br>
substituted with oxo(=O);<br>
R4 is hydrogen, C1-3alkyl, 0C1-3alkyl, SC1-3alkyl,<br>
N(Rb)2, NRbC(=O)C1-3alkyl, or a 5- or 6-membered saturated<br>
heterocyclic ring containing one N-RB group and<br>
optionally ring substituted with one to three C1-3alkyl<br>
groups;<br>
or R2 and R4 are taken together with the<br>
carbons to which they are attached to form a 5- to 7-<br>
membered saturated carbocyclic ring;<br>
and R5 is hydrogen or halo,<br>
provided that at least one of R2 and R4 is<br>
different from hydrogen, and that when R5 is halo, R2 or<br>
R4 is hydrogen,<br><br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
prodrugs, or solvates thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to<br>
provide compounds of structural formula (II), which,<br>
among other applications, can be used in a method of<br>

Examples of preferred R3 groups in formulas<br>
(I) and (II) include, but are not limited to.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As used herein, the term "C1-3alkyl" includes<br>
straight chain and branched alkyl groups containing one<br>
to three carbon atoms, i.e., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and<br>
isopropyl.<br>
"Halo" is defined herein as fluoro, chloro,<br>
bromo, and iodo.<br>
"Cyano" is defined as -CN.<br>
"Trifluoromethyl" is defined to mean -CF3.<br>
The abbreviation "Me" is methyl, i.e., -CH3.<br>
DNA-damaging agents that activate cell cycle<br>
checkpoints generally are referred to herein as<br>
"checkpoint activators." DNA-damaging agents that<br>
activate the checkpoint designated "Chkl" (pronounced .<br>
"check-one") are referred to herein as "Chkl activators."<br>
Likewise, inhibitors of such checkpoints are referred to<br>
herein as "checkpoint inhibitors" and "Chkl inhibitors,"<br>
respectively.<br>
As used herein, Chkl inhibitors are compounds<br>
that are capable of at least partially abrogating at<br>
least one cell cycle checkpoint activity of the Chkl<br>
protein. Abrogation of a cell cycle checkpoint is<br>
achieved when the cellular checkpoint mechanism is<br>
overcome sufficiently to allow the cell to pass from the<br>
cell cycle phase in which it is halted to the next phase<br>
in the cell cycle or to allow the cell to pass directly<br>
to cell death. Abrogation of a cell cycle checkpoint<br>
permits cells to carry damaged or imperfect genetic<br>
material to subsequent cell cycle phases, thereby<br>
inducing or promoting cell death. Cell death can occur<br><br>
by any mechanism, including apoptosis and mitotic<br>
catastrophe. The compounds of the invention are Chkl<br>
inhibitors.<br>
Chkl activator includes any known or after-<br>
discovered agent having the ability to activate Chkl<br>
kinase activity, and thus induce at least partial cell<br>
cycle arrest. Chkl activators include agents capable of<br>
arresting the cell cycle at any phase of the cell cycle,<br>
which phase may be referred to herein as the "target<br>
phase" for that activator. Target phases include any of<br>
the cell cycle phases except mitosis, i.e., any of the<br>
Gl, S, and G2 phases. Chkl activators useful in the<br>
invention include DNA damaging agents, such as<br>
chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation. Radiation Chkl<br>
activators include, but are not limited to, ionizing<br>
radiation. Ionizing radiation includes elctromgnetic or<br>
particulate radiation capable of producing ion pairs by<br>
interacting with matter. Ionizing radiation includes x<br>
and gamma rays, alpha and beta particles, neutrons and<br>
charged nuclei. Radioation includes ultraviolet light-,<br>
visible light, infrared radiation, microwave radiation,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Assays such as that described in<br>
Example 8 can be used to determine whether an agent is a<br>
Chkl activator.<br>
"Inhibiting aberrant cell proliferation" means<br>
retarding the rate at which aberrantly proliferating<br>
cells proliferate or eliminating such proliferation<br>
altogether. This inhibition can result either from a<br>
decreased rate of replication, an increased rate of cell<br>
death, or both. Cell death can occur by any mechanism,<br>
including apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe.<br><br>
"Preventing aberrant cell proliferation" means<br>
inhibiting aberrant cell proliferation prior to<br>
occurrence, or inhibiting the recurrence thereof.<br>
"In vivo" means within a living subject, as<br>
within an animal or human. In this context, agents can<br>
be used therapeutically in vivo to retard or eliminate<br>
the proliferation of aberrantly replicating cells. The<br>
agents also can be used in vivo as a prophylactic to<br>
prevent aberrant cell proliferation or the manifestation<br>
of symptoms associated therewith.<br>
"Ex vivo" means outside a living subject.<br>
Examples of ex vivo cell populations include cell<br>
cultures and biological samples such as fluid or tissue<br>
samples from humans or animals. Such samples can be<br>
obtained by methods well known in the art. Exemplary<br>
biological fluid samples include blood, cerebrospinal<br>
fluid, urine, saliva. Exemplary tissue samples include<br>
tumors and biopsies. In this context; the present<br>
compounds can be in numerous applications, both<br>
therapeutic and experimental.<br>
"Radiosensitizer," as used herein, means a<br>
compound, administered to a human or other animal in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount to increase the<br>
sensitivity of cells to electromagnetic radiation and/or<br>
to promote the treatment of diseases treatable with<br>
electromagnetic radiation.<br>
"Radiation" as used herein includes/ but is<br>
not limited to, radiation having wavelengths in the range<br>
of 10"20 to 100 meters.<br>
The term "container" means any receptacle and<br>
closure therefor suitable for storing, shipping,<br>
dispensing, and/or handling a pharmaceutical product.<br><br>
The term "package insert" means information<br>
accompanying the product that provides a description of<br>
how to administer the product, along with the safety and<br>
efficacy data required to allow the physician,<br>
pharmacist, and patient to make an informed decision<br>
regarding use of the product. The package insert<br>
generally is regarded as the "label" for a pharmaceutical<br>
product.<br>
The present invention includes all possible<br>
stereoisomers and geometric isomers of the compounds of<br>
structural formula (I) or (II) . The present invention<br>
includes not only racemic compounds, but optically active isomers as well. When a compound of structural formula<br>
(I) or (II) is desired as a single enantiomer, it can be<br>
obtained either by resolution of the final product or by<br>
stereospecific synthesis from either isomerically pure<br>
starting material or use of a chiral auxiliary reagent,<br>
for example, see Z. Ma et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry,<br>
8(6), 883-888 (1997). Resolution of the final product,<br>
an intermediate, or a starting material can be achieved<br>
by any suitable method known in the art. Additionally,<br>
in situations where tautomers of the compounds of<br>
structural formula (I) or (II) are possible, the present<br>
invention is intended to include all tautomeric forms of<br>
the compounds. As demonstrated below, specific<br>
stereoisomers can exhibit an exceptional ability to<br>
inhibit Chkl in combination with chemotherapeutic or<br>
radiotherapeutic treatments.<br>
Prodrugs of compounds of structural formula<br>
(I) or (II) also can be used as the compound in a method<br>
of the present invention. It is well established that a<br>
prodrug approach, wherein a compound is derivatized into<br>
a form suitable for formulation and/or administration,<br><br>
then released as a drug in vivo, has been successfully<br>
employed to transiently (e.g., bioreversibly) alter the<br>
physicochemical properties of the compound (see, H.<br>
Bundgaard, Ed., "Design of Prodrugs," Elsevier,<br>
Amsterdam, (1985); R.B. Silverman, "The Organic Chemistry<br>
of Drug Design and Drug Action," Academic Press, San<br>
Diego, chapter 8, (1992); K.M-. Hillgren et al., Med. Res.<br>
Rev., 15, 83 (1995)) .<br>
Compounds of the present invention contain one<br>
or more functional groups. The functional groups, if<br>
desired or necessary, can be modified to provide a<br>
prodrug. Suitable prodrugs include, for example, acid<br>
derivatives, such as amides and esters. It also is<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that N-oxides can<br>
be used as a prodrug.<br>
Compounds of the invention can exist as salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the<br>
invention generally are preferred in the methods of the<br>
invention. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts" refers to salts or zwitterionic forms<br>
of the compounds of structural formula (I) or (II).<br>
Salts of compounds of formula (I) or (II) can be prepared<br>
during the final isolation and purification of the<br>
compounds or separately by reacting the compound with an<br>
acid having a suitable cation. Suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable cations include alkali metal (e.g., sodium or<br>
potassium) and alkaline earth metal (e.g., calcium or<br>
magnesium) cations. In addition, the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of compounds of structural formula (I)<br>
or (II) that contain a basic center are acid addition<br>
salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids.<br>
Examples of acids which can be employed to form<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic acids<br><br>
such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic,sulfuric, and<br>
phosphoric, and organic acids such as oxalic, maleic,<br>
succinic, malonic, and citric. Nonlimiting examples of<br>
salts of compounds of the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide,<br>
sulfate, bisulfate, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate, phosphate,<br>
hydrogen phosphate, acetate, adipate, alginate,<br>
aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, camphorate,<br>
camphorsulfonate, citrate, digluconate, glycerolphsphate,<br>
hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, formate, succinate,<br>

naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate,<br>
persulfate, 3-phenylproprionate, picrate, pivalate,<br>
propionate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate,<br>
glutamate, bicarbonate, paratoluenesulfonate,<br>
undecanoate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate,<br>
benzene sulphonate, and p-toluenesulphonate salts. In<br>
addition, available amino groups present' in the compounds<br>
of the invention can be quaternized with methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides;<br>
dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates; decyl,<br>
lauryl, myristyl, and steryl chlorides, bromides, and<br>
iodides; and benzyl and phenethyl bromides. In light of<br>
the foregoing, any reference to compounds of the present<br>
invention appearing herein is intended to include<br>
compounds of structural formula (I) or (II) as well as<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs<br>
thereof.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be<br>
therapeutically administered as the neat chemical, but it<br>
is preferable to administer the compounds as a<br>
pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Thus, the<br>
present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of the formula (I) or (II) together<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier<br>
therefor. Also provided is a process of preparing a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing a compound<br>
of formula (I) or (II) with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further<br>
provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a<br>
compound of structural formula (I) or (II), or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, or solvate<br>
thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers and, optionally, other therapeutic<br>
and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carriers are<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the<br>
other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious<br>
to the recipient thereof.<br><br>
Compounds of the invention exhibit<br>
unexpectedly high potency. Potency typically is<br>
expressed as the concentration of a compound required to<br>
achieve a certain result. The greater the potency, the<br>
less compound required to perform its intended function.<br>
In vitro potency typically is expressed in terras of IC50<br>
values and measured using a dose-response assay. IC50<br>
values can be measured by contacting a sensitive assay<br>
system with a compound of interest over a range of<br>
concentrations, including concentrations at which no or<br>
minimal effect is observed, through higher concentrations<br>
at which partial effect is observed, to saturating<br>
concentrations at which a maximum effect is observed.<br>
Theoretically, such assays of the dose-response effect of<br>
inhibitor compounds can be described as a sigmoidal curve<br>
expressing a degree of inhibition as a function of<br>
concentration when plotted on a log scale. The curve<br>
also theoretically passes through a point at which the<br>
concentration is sufficient to reduce activity of the<br>
checkpoint enzyme to a level that is 50% that of the<br>
difference between minimal and maximal enzyme activity<br>
observed in the assay. This concentration is defined as<br>
the Inhibitory Concentration at 50% inhibition or IC50<br>
value.<br>
ICS0 values can be determined using<br>
conventional biochemical (acellular) assay techniques or<br>
cell-based assay techniques well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. An example of such an assay<br>
is provided in Example 1 below.<br>
Preferably, IC5o values are obtained by<br>
performing the relevant assay at least twice, with the<br>
IC50 value expressed as the average (arithmetic mean, or<br>
"mean") of the individual values obtained. More<br><br>
preferably, the assay is repeated from 3 to 10 (or more)<br>
times, with the IC50 value expressed as the mean of the<br>
values obtained. Most preferably, the assay is performed<br>
a number of times sufficient to generate a statistically<br>
reliable mean IC50 value, using statistical methods known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Compounds of the invention 'exhibit<br>
unexpectedly low IC50 values, corresponding to<br>
unexpectedly high in vitro potency. Compounds of the<br>
invention, when assayed as described in Example 1 below,<br>
exhibit IC50 values of less than about 200 nM, in some<br>
embodiments less than about 150 nM, in other embodiments<br>
less than about 100 nM, in others less than about 50 nM,<br>
in others less than about 10 nM, and in others less than<br>
about 5 nM. In other embodiments, the compounds of the<br>
invention exhibit IC50 values from about 0.1 nM to about<br>
5 nM.<br>
Compounds of the invention exhibit selectivity<br>
for inhibiting Chkl over other protein kinases.<br>
Selectivity may be advantageous in reducing adverse side<br>
effects and/or increasing therapeutic index.<br>
"Selectivity" is expressed herein as "fold<br>
selectivity." In general, fold selectivity, as used<br>
herein, is the IC50 of a test compound for a comparison<br>
enzyme divided by the IC50 of a comparator enzyme. In<br>
particular, fold selectivity for a Chkl inhibitor, as<br>
used herein, is the IC50 of a Chkl inhibitor (a test<br>
compound) for Chkl (the comparison enzyme) divided by the<br>
ICso for a comparator enzyme. Comparator enzymes against<br>
which compounds of the invention may be measured include<br>
at least the following protein kinases: Cdc2, Chk2,<br>
CTAK, EphAl, EphA2, Erkl, FGFR1, FGFR4, IR, JNKl, c-Kit,<br>
p38alpha, p38beta, p38delta, Ros, Rse, Rsk2, TrkA, TrkB,<br><br>
protein kinas A, protein kinas C, pp60v-src, protein<br>
kinase B/Akt-1, p38MapK, p70S6K, calcium calmodulin-<br>
dependent kinase II, and abl tyrosine kinase.<br>
Assays for determining ICS0 values for a test<br>
compound against a comparator enzyme are described in<br>
Example 2 and are well known to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art. Compounds of the invention exhibit at least<br>
about 20-fold selectivity over the aforementioned protein<br>
kinases tested, in some embodiments, Chkl inhibitors of<br>
the present invention exhibit at least about 50-fold<br>
selectivity, in other embodiments at least about 75-fold<br>
. selectivity, in other embodiments at least about 100-fold<br>
selectivity in inhibiting Chkl over the aforementioned<br>
protein kinases tested.<br>
The compounds of the invention exhibit<br>
unexpectedly high potency in a cell-based assay. To<br>
measure cell-based potency of a Chkl inhibitor, an assay<br>
was developed that allows one to measure the<br>
concentration of Chkl inhibitor required to increase the<br>
growth-inhibiting effects of a DNA damaging agent in a<br>
cell-based model involving aberrantly proliferating<br>
cells." This measure of cell-based potency, is expressed<br>
herein as an "ECTrs" value, where "ECTFS" is the Effective<br>
Concentration of Chkl inhibitor that produces a Two-Fold<br>
Sensitization of a population of aberrantly proliferating<br>
cells to the growth-inhibiting effects of a DNA damaging<br>
agent. ECTFs is calculated to be the concentration of<br>
Chkl inhibitor that reduces the amount of DNA damaging<br>
agent required for 90% inhibition of cell growth by half.<br>
Applicants have found that the compounds of the invention<br>
exhibit unexpectedly low ECTFS values, corresponding to<br>
unexpectedly high cell-based potency.<br><br>
Another parameter that may be measured is the<br>
the fold sensitization achieved at the LD50 (the dose of<br>
compound alone that' inhibits growth of 50% of cells) for<br>
the Chkl inhibitor compound. These two values, BCTFS and<br>
fold sensitization at the LD50, allow direct ranking of<br>
both the potency and toxicity of Chkl inhibitors with<br>
respect to one another.<br>
An example of an assay useful to measure ECTFS<br>
values is described in Example 3 below. Briefly, this<br>
assay uses. HT29 human colon carcinoma cells as the<br>
population of aberrantly proliferating cells, gemcitabine<br>
as the DNA damaging agent/Chkl activator, and a compound<br>
of the invention as the Chkl inhibitor. The population<br>
of aberrantly proliferating cells is cultured and allowed<br>
to grow in a suitable growth medium. Subsequently, the<br>
cells are subjected to the DNA damaging agent over a<br>
range of concentrations. After a predetermined amount of<br>
time, the DNA damaging agent is removed, and the cells<br>
are subjected to a Chkl inhibitor over a range of<br>
concentrations and for a predetermined period of time.<br>
The plates of cultured cells then are harvested and the<br>
relative number of surviving cells is counted.- The data<br>
is normalized against Chkl inhibitor alone as control,<br>
and then plotted on a log/log graph of DNA damaging agent<br>
concentration vs. relative cell survival (100% equaling<br>
1.0). The fold sensitization is derived from the<br>
difference between the amount of DNA damaging agent<br>
required to achieve 90% growth inhibition with and<br>
without Chkl inhibitor for each concentration of Chkl<br>
inhibitor used. These data then are plotted on a graph<br>
of Chkl inhibitor concentration vs. fold sensitization,<br>
from which ECTFs is calculated.<br><br>
Preferably ECTFs values are obtained by<br>
performing the assay at least twice, with the ECTFS value<br>
expressed as the mean of the individual values obtained.<br>
More preferably, the assay is repeated from 3 to 10 (or<br>
more) times, with the ECTFS value expressed as the mean of<br>
the values obtained. Most preferably, the assay is<br>
performed a number of times necessary to generate a<br>
statistically reliable mean ECTFS value, using statistical<br>
methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
All compounds that were subject to an ECTFS<br>
assay exhibited ECTFS values of less than about 1000 nM.<br>
In contrast, structurally similar compounds that are<br>
previously known exhibit ECTFS values of about 11,000 nM.<br>
In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention<br>
exhibit ECTFS values of less than about 500 nM, in others<br>
less than about 300 nM, in others less than about 200 nM,<br>
in others less than about 150nM, in others less than<br>
about 100 nM, in others less than abut 50 nM, in others<br>
less than about 30 nM, and in others less than about<br>
20 nM, or less than about 10 nM, or in other embodiments<br>
less than about 5 nM.<br>

SYNTHETIC METHODS<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by the following synthetic schemes. First, the<br>
alkoxyarylamines used to prepare the Chkl inhibitors<br>
described herein can be prepared by different general<br>
synthetic schemes. For example, General Scheme 1<br>
summarizes the reaction of a nitrophenol with an<br>
activated form of an alcohol, formed in situ or prepared<br>
and isolated independently, to provide a nitrophenyl<br>
ether product. Reduction of the ether under standard<br>
conditions provides an arylamine that is used to produce<br>
a compound of the invention.<br>
General Scheme 1<br><br>
Alternatively, reaction of a halo nitrobenzene with an<br>
alcohol in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium<br>
hydride or potassium bis (trirmethylsilyl) amide, also<br>
affords nitroaryl ethers, as illustrated in General<br>
Scheme 2. These ethers then are reduced as indicated in<br>
General Scheme 1.<br><br>
General Scheme 2<br><br>
Conversion of an arylamine to a urea can be<br>
achieved by one of several synthetic schemes. For<br>
example, an arylamine can be reacted with a pyrazine<br>
carbamate to yield a urea as illustrated in General<br>
Scheme 3.<br>
General Scheme 3<br><br>
Alternatively, as outlined in General Scheme 4, heat<br>
induced decomposition of an acyl azide produces a<br>
reactive aryl isocyanate which then is allowed to react<br>
with an arylamine to yield the desired urea.<br>
General Scheme 4<br><br>
Another approach, illustrated in General Scheme 5,<br>
utilizes phosgene or a phosgene equivalent to couple two<br>
arylamines and provide a urea.<br><br>

Preparation of Compounds<br>
The following compounds of the present<br>
invention were prepared using the general schemes<br>
disclosed above. Additional compounds of the invention<br>
can be prepared using the above general schemes, and the<br>
following specific syntheses, by a judicious selection of<br>
starting materials.<br><br>
Compound 1<br><br>
1- [5-Chloro-2-S- ([1,4] oxazepan-2-ylmethoxy) -phenyl]-3-(5-<br>
methyl-pyrazin-2-yl)-urea<br>
Step 1: 2-Amino-5~methylpyrazine.<br>
Aminomalononitrile p-toluenesulfonate salt (20.0 g, 79<br>
mmol) and pyruvaldehyde 1-oxime (6.88 g, 79 mmol) were<br>
combined in a flask. iPrOH (140 mL) was added, and the<br>
resulting yellow slurry was allowed to stir at room<br>
temperature for 18 h, during which time a yellow<br>
precipitate accumulated. The mixture was filtered and<br>
the precipitate was washed with iPrOH (2 x 50 mL) and DI<br>
H20 (20 mL), then lyophilized to give 2-amino-3-cyano-5-<br>
methypyrazine N-oxide (10.7 g).<br>
The pyrazine N-oxide was suspended in MeOH (22<br>
mL) and AcOH (5 mL). To this, 5% Pt/C (1.6 g) and Darco<br>
KB-B (8 g) were carefully added. The mixture was allowed<br>
to absorb H2 at 60 psi for 18 h. The reaction was<br>
quenched with 25% NaOH (34 mL) and purged with N2 for 30<br>
min. The mixture was filtered through a bed of wet<br>
celite and washed with MeOH (4 x 100 mL). The filtrate<br>
was concentrated in vacuo to a quarter volume. The<br>
filtrate was diluted with EtOAc (150 mL) and washed with<br>
5% NaOH (30 mL) and back extracted with EtOAc (2 x 70<br>
mL). The organic layers were combined and washed with<br>
sat'd NaCl (20 mL), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo<br>
to give an orange sticky solid (5.16 g).<br><br>
Step 2: (5-Methylpyrazin~2-yl) carbamic acid<br>
phenyl ester. 2-And.no-5-methylpyrazi.ne (5.16 g, 47 mmol)<br>
was dissolved in CHZC12 (52 mL) , stirred and cooled to 0°C<br>
under N2. To this, pyridine (4.8 mL, 59 mmol) was added<br>
followed by phenyl chloroformate (6.2 mL, 59 mmol) ,<br>
dropwise, over 15 min, causing a precipitate to form.<br>
The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h. Then the<br>
reaction was quenched with 0.25 M HCl (40 mL) and<br>
anhydrous ether (50 mL), and stirred at 0°C, for 30 min.<br>
The precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed with<br>
DI H20 (20 mL) and ether (2 x 25 mL) , and dried under<br>
vacuum to give the product (7.4 g) as a white fluffy<br>
powder.<br>
Step 3: (5)-2-Hydroxymethyl-[l,4]oxazepane-4-<br>
carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester. To a 250 mL round<br>
bottom flask were added (S)-(+)-benzyl glycidyl ether,<br>
(1.31 g, 7.9 mmol), 3-benzylamino-propan-l-ol (1.3 g, 7.9<br>
mmol) and 10 mL EtOH. The mixture was heated to 40°C for<br>
15 h. The reaction was cooled and concentrated in vacuo<br>
and the resulting oily product was used without further<br>
purification. The diol was placed in a 250 mL round<br>
bottom flask and dissolved in 75 mL dry pyridine. The<br>
solution was cooled to 0°C and toluene sulfonyl chloride<br>
(5.27 g, 27.7 mmol) was added in one portion. The<br>
mixture was stirred for 6 h, carefully maintaining the<br>
reaction temperature at 0°C. The cold reaction was<br>
quenched with 50 mL sat'd aqueous NaHC03 solution. An<br>
additional 20 mL of water was added and the mixture was<br>
extracted three times with 100 mL portions of EtOAc. The<br>
combined organics were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated<br>
in vacuo. The alcohol then was purified by column<br>
chromatography using a 25-50% gradient of EtOAc and<br><br>
hexanes as the eluent. This yielded 1.39 g of tosyl<br>
alcohol as a yellow oil.<br>
The alcohol was dissolved in 50 mL DMF and<br>
cooled to 0CC. To the cold, stirred mixture was<br>
carefully added 95% wt. NaH (0.29 g, 11.5 mmol) . The<br>
reaction was stirred at 0°C for 15 min, then allowed to<br>
slowly warm to room temperature and stirred 6 h. The<br>
reaction was carefully quenched with 50 mL of water and<br>
extracted three times with 50 mL portions of EtOAc. The<br>
combined organics were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated<br>
under vacuum. The crude product was taken up in EtOH and<br>
placed in a Parr hydrogenation apparatus. Also added to<br>
the solution were 10% wt. Pd/C (0.426 g, 0.30 mmol) and<br>
2M HC1 (2.1 mL). The hydrogenation was run at 50 psi for<br>
2 days at which point the reaction was deemed to be done<br>
by LCMS analysis. The solution was neutralized with<br>
sat'd aqueous NaHC03 solution and extracted using a 3:1<br>
mixture of CHCl3:iPrOH. The combined organics were<br>
concentrated under vacuum and the crude product was taken<br>
on to the next step.<br>
The crude amino alcohol was dissolved in 100<br>
mL dry CH2C12. To this solution were added TEA (1.59 mL,<br>
11.5 mmol) and di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (5.74 g, 5.74<br>
mmol). The solution was stirred at room temperature for<br>
18 h, then quenched with sat'd aqueous NaHC03 solution<br>
and extracted three times using 50 mL portions of CH2CI2.<br>
The combined organics were dried over Na2SO4 and<br>
concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified by<br>
column chromatography using a 25-50% gradient of<br>
EtOAc/hexanes. This yielded 0.240 g of the oxazapane<br>
alcohol as a yellow oil.<br>
Step 4: (S)-2-(4-Chloro-2-nitro-<br>
phenoxymethyl)-[1,4]oxazepane-4-carboxylic acid tert-<br><br>
butyl ester. To a 50 mL round bottom were added<br>
oxazapane alcohol (0.240 g, 1.03 mmol), TEA (0.21 mL,<br>
1.545 mmol), and 10 ml dry CH2C12. The solution was<br>
cooled to 0°C and methane sulfonyl chloride (0.10 mL) was<br>
added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at 0°C<br>
and then quenched, cold, with water. The layers were<br>
separated and the aqueous layer was extracted once with<br>
20 mL CH2C12. The combined organics were dried over<br>
Na2SO« and concentrated under vacuum. The crude mesylate<br>
then was dissolved' in 5 mL dry DMF. To this solution was<br>
added Cs2C03 (0.671 g, 2.06 mmol) and 4-chloro-2-nitro-<br>
phenol (0.215 g, 1.24 mmol). This bright yellow solution<br>
then was heated to 100°C overnight. The reaction was<br>
cooled to room temperature, quenched with 50 mL of water,<br>
and extracted three times with 50 mL portions of EtOAc.<br>
The product was purified by flash chromatography using a<br>
10-35% gradient of EtOAc/hexanes. This sequence of steps<br>
yielded 0.120 g of the nitrophenyl oxazapane as a bright<br>
yellow oil.<br>
Step 5: l-[5-Chloro-2-([l,4)oxazepan-2-(S)-<br>
ylmethoxy)-phenyl]-3-(5-methyl-pyrazin-2-yl)-urea. In a<br>
25 mL round bottom were placed nitrophenyl oxazapane<br>
(0.120 g, 0.31 mmol) and Pt20 (0.007 g, 0.03 mmol) in 5<br>
mL MeOH. A helium balloon was attached, the flask was<br>
evacuated using an aspirator, and backfilled with H2<br>
three times, then allowed to stir under H2 for 2 h. The<br>
reaction was filtered through celite, washing the celite<br>
pad twice with 20 mL portions of MeOH. The solution was<br>
concentrated in vacuo. The crude aniline was dissolved<br>
in 5 mL of dry DMF. To this solution were added TEA<br>
(0.005 mL, 0.34 mmol) and (5-methylpyrazin-2-yl) carbamic<br>
acid phenyl ester (0.07 g, 0.31 mmol). This mixture was<br>
stirred 18 h at room temperature. The solvent was<br><br>
removed under vacuum and the residue was redissolved in<br>
10 mL EtOAc and washed with sat'd aqueous NaHC03<br>
solution. The organics were dried over Na2SO« and<br>
concentrated at reduced pressure. The gray/brown residue<br>
was covered with 3 raL CH2C12 and to this was added 1 mL<br>
concentrated trifluoroacetic acid. Upon addition of acid<br>
all solids dissolved. The reaction was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 4 h at which time sat'd aqueous NaHC03<br>
solution is added until solution reaches pH 8. The<br>
mixture was extracted three times with 10 mL portions of<br>
a 3:1 mixture of CHCl3:iPrOH. The combined organics were<br>
then dried over NazSO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The<br>
off white solids then were trituated in EtOAc and<br>
filtered through a medium fritted filter, washing with 50<br>
mL of EtOAc. The white solid was thoroughly dried under<br>
vacuum. This sequence yielded 0.020 g of the desired<br>
urea as a fine white powder. ^-NMR (300 MHz, d6-DMSO) 5<br>

1-[5-Methyl-2- (1 -methyl-piperazin-2-ylmethoxy) -phenyl]-3-<br>
(5-methyl-pyrazin-2-yl) -urea<br>
Step 1: 3-Hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-piperazine-<br>
1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester. Piperazine-2-<br>
carboxylic acid (20 g, 154 iranol) in a slurry with 200 mL<br>
of 1:1 H20/dioxane was cooled in an ice bath and treated<br>
with solid NaOH (11 g) followed by a solution of di-tert-<br>
butyl dicarbonate (21.6 g, 99 mmole) in dioxane added<br>
dropwise from an addition funnel. The reaction pH was<br>
adjusted to pH&gt;10 as needed during the course of the<br>
reaction. The resulting mixture was allowed to stir for<br>
3 h, then diluted with water until homogeneous and<br>
acidified with concentrated aqueous HC1 until the pH was<br>
between 2 and 3. The solution was washed with ether then<br>
the pH was adjusted with NaOH until pH was 6.5 to 7. The<br>
solution was allowed to stand several days and the<br>
resulting precipitate was collected by filtration to give<br>
piperazine-1,3-dicarboxylic acid 1-tert-butyl ester as a<br>
white solid (9.7 g).<br>
A slurry of piperazine-1,3-dicarboxylic acid<br>
1-tert-butyl ester (4.62 g, 20.0 mmol) in CH3OH (100 mL)<br>
was treated with aqueous formaldehyde (40 mmol) and<br>
formic acid (70 mmol), then heated at 65CC for several<br>
hours. Upon completion by HPLC, the reaction was allowed<br>
to cool and was concentrated in vacuo.<br><br>
The residue was taken up in THF and cooled in<br>
an ice bath, then treated with a solution of lithium<br>
aluminum hydride in THF (19.0 mmol) . After 1 h, the<br>
reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and<br>
stired for an additional 30 min. The reaction then was<br>
cooled in an ice bath and quenched with H20 (0.7 5 mL) and<br>
15% aqueous NaOH solution (0.75 mL) , and H20 again (3 x<br>
0.75 mL) . The salts were removed by filtration and the<br>
filtrate concentrated under vacuum to' give the crude<br>
product. Chromatography over silica gel (2.5% MeOH in<br>
CH2C12) gave the product as a yellow oil (0.70 g) .<br>
