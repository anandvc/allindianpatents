PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE IN CONTROLLING PESTS<br>
The present invention relates to piperazine derivatives, to processes for preparing them, to insecticidal, acaricidal, molluscicidal and nematicidal compositions comprising them and to methods of using them to combat and control insect, acarine, mollusc and nematode pests.<br>
Piperazine derivatives with antiprotazoal properties are disclosed in for example in US3331845 and EP103464 discloses pyrimidinyl piperazine compounds with antibacterial properties.  WO02/42310 discloses 7-oxabicyclo[2.2. ljheptanes as insecticides. Piperazine derivatives with pharmaceutical properties are described in US 3457263 and WO2004/089905.  The synthesis of piperazine compounds is described in J. Het. Chem., 38, 2001, 985-988.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that certain piperazines have insecticidal properties.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method of combating and controlling insects, acarines, nematodes or molluscs which comprises applying to a pest, to a locus of a pest, or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I):<br>

Thus a compound of formula 1 may be obtained from a compound of formula 2 by reaction with a suitable electrophilic species. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a carbonyl group may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 2 with a carboxylic acid derivative of formula R1-C(0)-Z where Z is chloride, hydroxy, alkoxy or acyloxy at a temperature between 0°C and 150°C optionally in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane, optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine and optionally in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a carbonyl group and Rl is an amino substituent of formula R'-NH- may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 4 with an isocyanate of formula R'-N=C-0 under similar conditions. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a group of formula S(0)m may be formed<br><br>
from compounds of formula 2 by treatment with compounds of formula of Rl-S(0)m-Cl under similar conditions. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a thiocarbonyl group and Rl is an amino substituent of formula R'-NH- may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 2 with an isothiocyanate of formula R'-N'OS under similar conditions.<br>
Alternatively compounds of formula 1 where Y is a thiocarbonyl group and Rl is a carbon substituent may be formed by treatment of compounds of formula 1 where Y is a carbonyl group and Rl is a carbon substituent with a suitable thionating agent such as Lawesson's reagent.<br>
In the above procedures, acid derivatives of the formula R1-C(0)-Z, isocyanates of formula R'-N-C^O, isothiocyanates of formula R'-N^C-S and sulfur electrophiles of formula Rl -S(0)q-CI are either known compounds or may be formed from known compounds by known methods by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula 2 may be prepared from compounds of formula 3 by reduction of the nitro group, according to known methods by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula 3 may be obtained from compounds of formula 6 where P is H by reaction with an alkylating agent of the formula R8-L, where L is chloride, bromide, iodide or a sulfonate (e.g. mesylate or tosylate) or similar leaving group at a temperature of between ambient temperature and 100°C5 typically 65°C, in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as Iriethylamine or diisopropylethylamine and optionally catalysed by halide salts such as sodium iodide, potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide. Alternatively, a compound of formula 6 where P is H may be reacted with an aldehyde of the formula RzCHO at a temperature between ambient temperature and 100°C in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or ethanol or mixtures of solvents in the presence of a reducing agent such as borane-pyridine complex, sodium borohydride, sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or such like, to produce a compound of formula 3 where R8 is CH2-RZ.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula 1 maybe obtained from a compound of formula 4 by (1) reaction with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid at ambient temperature in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane followed by neutralisation of the reaction mixture with an aqueous solution of an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or similar compound; then (2) reaction with an alkylating agent or an aldehyde as described above.<br><br>
Compounds of formula 4 may be formed by reaction of compounds of formula 5 with a suitable electrophile, as described above in the method for converting compounds of formula 2 to compounds of formula 1.<br>
Compounds of formula 5 may be obtained from compounds of formula 6 where P is t-butoxycarbonyl by reduction of the nitro group according to known methods.<br>
Compounds of formula 6 may be obtained from compounds of formula 7 by reaction with piperazine (P = H) or N-BOC-piperazine (P = t-butoxycarbonyl) at a temperature between 0°C and 180°C, in a solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or potassium carbonate or in the absence of base.<br>
Compounds of formula 5, formula 6 and formula 7 are known compounds or may be made from known compounds by known methods.<br>
Certain compounds of formula 2, formula 3 and formula 4 are novel and as such form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The skilled person will readily recognise that it is possible to convert one compound of formula 1 wherein R2 is H or an intermediate of Scheme 1 to other compounds of formula I. Examples of such transformations are given in Schemes 2, 3 and 4 in which the R groups have the meanings as defined for a compound of formula I above.<br><br><br><br>

The invention therefore provides a method of combating and controlling insects, acarines, nematodes or molluscs which comprises applying an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a composition containing a compound of formula (I), to a pest, a locus of pest, or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest, The compounds of formula (I) are preferably used against insects, acarines or nematodes.<br>
The term "plant" as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees.<br>
In order to apply a compound of formula (I) as an insecticide, acaricide, nematicide or molluscicide to a pest, a locus of pest, or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest, a compound of formula (I) is usually formulated into a composition which includes, in addition to the compound of formula (I), a suitable inert diluent or carrier and, optionally, a surface active agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals which are able to modify the properties of an interface (for example, liquid/solid, liquid/air or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion, emulsification and wetting): It is preferred that all compositions (both solid and liquid formulations) comprise, by weight, 0.0001 to 95%, more preferably 1 to 85%, for example 5 to 60%, of a compound of formula (I). The composition is generally used for the control of pests such that a compound of formula (I) is applied at a rate of from O.lg to 10kg per hectare, preferably from lg to 6kg per hectare, more preferably from 1 g to 1kg per hectare.<br>
When used in a seed dressing, a compound of formula (I) is used at a rate of 0.0001 g to lOg (for example 0.001 g or 0.05g), preferably 0.005g to lOg, more preferably 0.005g to 4g, per kilogram of seed.<br><br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an insecticidal acaricidal, nematicidal or molluscicidal composition comprising an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidallyormolluscicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a suitable carrier or diluent therefor. The composition is preferably an insecticidal, acaricidal, nematicidal or molluscicidal composition.<br>
In a still further aspect the invention provides a method of combating and controlling pests at a locus which comprises treating the pests or the locus of the pests with an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of formula (I). The compounds of formula (I) are preferably used against insects, acarines or nematodes.<br>
The compositions can be chosen from a number of formulation types, including dustable powders (DP), soluble powders (SP), water soluble granules (SG), water dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), granules (GR) (slow or fast release), soluble concentrates (SL), oil miscible liquids (OL), ultra low volume liquids (UL), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), dispersible concentrates (DC), emulsions (both oil in water (EW) and water in oil (EO)), micro-emulsions (ME), suspension concentrates (SC), aerosols, fogging/smoke formulations, capsule suspensions (CS) and seed treatment formulations. The formulation type chosen in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged and the physical, chemical and biological properties of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Dustable powders (DP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (I) with one or more solid diluents (for example natural clays, kaolin, pyrophyllite, bentonite, alumina, montmorillonite, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulphur, lime, flours, talc and other organic and inorganic solid carriers) and mechanically grinding the mixture to.a fine powder.<br>
Soluble powders (SP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (I) with one or more water-soluble inorganic salts (such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate or magnesium sulphate) or one or more water-soluble organic solids (such as a polysaccharide) and, optionally, one or more wetting agents, one or more dispersing agents or a mixture of said agents to improve water dispersibility/soliibility. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water soluble granules (SG).<br>
Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (I) with one or more solid diluents or carriers, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or<br><br>
more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be formed either by granulating a mixture of a compound of formula (I) and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers, or from pre-formed blank granules by absorbing a compound of formula (I) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earths or ground corn cobs) or by adsorbing a compound of formula (I) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) on to a hard core material (such as sands, silicates, mineral carbonates, sulphates or phosphates) and drying if necessary. Agents which are commonly used to aid absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones and esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additives may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of formula (I) in water or an organic solvent, such as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These ■ solutions may contain a surface active agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of formula (I) in an organic solvent (optionally containing one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of said agents). Suitable organic solvents for use in ECs include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes, exemplified by SOLVESSO 100, SOLVESSO 150 and SOLVESSO 200; SOLVESSO is a Registered Trade Mark), ketones (such as cyclohexanone or methylcyclohexanone) and alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, fiirfuryl alcohol orbutanol), N-alkylpyrrolidones (such as N-methylpyrrolidone or N-octylpyrrolidone), dimethyl amides of fatty acids (such as Cg-Cio fatty acid dimethylamide) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. An EC product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with sufficient stability to allow spray application through appropriate equipment. Preparation of an EW involves obtaining a compound of formula (I) either as a liquid (if it is not a liquid at room temperature, it may be melted at a reasonable temperature, typically below 70°C) or in<br><br>
solution (by dissolving it in an appropriate solvent) and then emulsifiying the resultant liquid or solution into water containing one or more SFAs, under high shear, to produce an emulsion. Suitable solvents for use in EWs include vegetable oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as chlorobenzenes), aromatic solvents (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes) and other appropriate organic solvents which have a low solubility in water.<br>
Microemulsions (ME) may be prepared by mixing water with a blend of one or more solvents with one or more SFAs, tp produce spontaneously a thermodynamically stable isotropic liquid formulation. A compound of formula (I) is present initially in either the water or the solvent/SFA blend. Suitable solvents for use in MEs include those hereinbefore described for use in in ECs or in EWs. An ME may be either an oil-in-water or a water-in-oil system (which system is present may be determined by conductivity measurements) and may be suitable for mixing water-soluble and oil-soluble pesticides in the same formulation. An ME is suitable for dilution into water, either remaining as a microemulsion or forming a conventional oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Suspension concentrates (SC) may comprise aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions of finely divided insoluble solid particles of a compound of formula (I). SCs may be prepared by ball or bead milling the solid compound of formula (I) in a suitable medium, optionally with one or more dispersing agents, to produce a fine particle suspension of the compound. One or more wetting agents may be included in the composition and a suspending agent may be included to reduce the rate at which the particles settle. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) may be dry milled and added to water, containing agents hereinbefore described, to produce the desired end product.<br>
Aerosol formulations comprise a compound of formula (I) and a suitable propellant (for example n-butane). A compound of formula (I) may also be dissolved or dispersed in a suitable medium (for example water or a water miscible liquid, such as /i-propanol) to provide compositions for use in non-pressurised, hand-actuated spray pumps.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating, in an enclosed space, a smoke containing the compound.<br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW formulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtained, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and<br><br>
contains a compound of formula (I) and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell maybe produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the compound of formula (I) and they may be used for seed treatment. A compound of formula (I) may also be formulated in a biodegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br>
A composition may include one or more additives to improve the biological performance of the composition (for example by improving wetting, retention or distribution on surfaces; resistance to rain on treated surfaces; or uptake or mobility of a compound of formula (I)). Such additives include surface active agents, spray additives based on oils, for example certain mineral oils or natural plant oils (such as soy bean and rape seed oil), and blends of these with other bio-enhancing adjuvants (ingredients which may aid or modify the action of a compound of formula (I)).<br>
A compound of formula (I) may also be formulated for use as a seed treatment, for example as a powder composition, including a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), a water soluble powder (SS) or a water dispersible powder for slurry treatment (WS), or as a liquid composition, including a flowable concentrate (FS), a solution (LS) or a capsule suspension (CS). The preparations of DS, SS, WS, FS and LS compositions are very similar to those of, respectively. DP, SP, WP, SC and DC compositions described above. Compositions for treating seed may include an agent for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed (for example a mineral oil or a film-forming barrier).<br>
Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be surface SFAs of the cationic, anionic, amphoteric or non-ionic type.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the cationic type include quaternary ammonium compounds (for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), imidazolines and amine salts.<br>
Suitable anionic SFAs include alkali metals salts of fatty acids, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid (for example sodium lauryl sulphate), salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds (for example sodium dodecylbehzenesulphonate, calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate and mixtures of sodium di-isopropyl- and trwscpropyl-naphthalene sulphonates), ether sulphates, alcohol ether sulphates (for example sodium laureth-3-sulphate), ether carboxylates (for example sodium laureth-3-carboxylate), phosphate esters (products from the reaction between one or more<br><br>
fatty alcohols and phosphoric acid (predominately mono-esters) or phosphorus pentoxide (predominately di-esters), for example the reaction between lauryl alcohol and tetraphosphoric acid; additionally these products maybe ethoxylated), sulphosuccinamates, paraffin or olefme sulphonates, taurates and lignosulphonates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the amphoteric type include betaines, propionates and glycinates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the non-ionic type include condensation products of alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof, with fatty alcohols (such as oleyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol) or with alkylphenois (such as octylphenol, nonylphenol or octylcresol); partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids or hexitol anhydrides; condensation products of said partial esters with ethylene oxide; block polymers (comprising ethylene oxide and propylene oxide); alkanolamides; simple esters (for example fatty acid polyethylene glycol esters); amine oxides (for example lauryl dimethyl amine oxide); and lecithins.<br>
Suitable suspending agents include hydrophilic colloids (such as polysaccharides, polyvinylpyrrolidone or sodium carboxymethylcellulose) and swelling clays (such as bentonite or attapulgile).<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be applied by any of the known means of applying pesticidal compounds. For example, it may be applied, formulated or unformulated, to the pests or to a locus of the pests (such as a habitat of the pests, or a growing plant liable to infestation by the pests) or to any part of the plant, including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, to the seed before it is planted or to other media in which plants are growing or are to be planted (such as soil surrounding the roots, the soil generally, paddy water or hydroponic culture systems), directly or it may be sprayed on, dusted on, applied by dipping, applied as a cream or paste formulation, applied as a vapour or applied through distribution or incorporation of a composition (such as a granular composition or a composition packed in a water-soluble bag) in soil or an aqueous environment.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being added to water before use. These concentrates, which may<br><br>
include DCs, SCs, ECs, EWs, MEs SGs, SPs, WPs, WGs and CSs, are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may contain varying amounts of a compound of formula (I) (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Suitable formulation types include granules of fertiliser. The mixtures suitably contain up to 25% by weight of the compound of formula (I).<br>
The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and a compound of formula (I).<br>
The compositions of this invention may contain other compounds having biological activity, for example micronutrients or compounds having fungicidal activity or which possess plant growth regulating, herbicidal, insecticidal, nematicidal or acaricidal activity.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may be the sole active ingredient of the composition or it may be admixed with one or more additional active ingredients such as a pesticide, fungicide, synergist, herbicide or plant growth regulator where appropriate. An additional active ingredient may: provide a composition having a broader spectrum of activity or increased persistence at a locus; synergise the activity or complement the activity (for example by increasing the speed of effect or overcoming repellency) of the compound of formula (I); or help to overcome or prevent the development of resistance to individual components.

Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients which have significantly different physical, chemical or biological properties such that they do not easily lend themselves to the same conventional formulation type. In these circumstances other formulation types may be prepared. For example, where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a water insoluble liquid, it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) formulation. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples:<br><br>
