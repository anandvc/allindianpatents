CYCLIC COMPOUND, PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME, AND PEST<br>
CONTROL AGENT<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a cyclic compound, a process for producing the same, and a pest control agent (pest controller), in particular, a cyclic compound useful as an insecticide which contains heterocyclic ring having at least two nitrogen atoms as ring constituting atoms and having an oxo group, a process for producing the same and a pest controller using the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Numerous cyclic compounds useful as an agricultural chemical have been known. For example, JP 4 6-6550A and NL 710535A disclose a compound having insecticidal activity represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein A represents a hydrogen atom,  a halogen atom, methyl group or methoxy group, B represents a hydrogen atom,  a halogen atom,  methyl group or methoxy group, provided that A and B are not a hydrogen atom at the same time, and R represents an optionally substituted phenyl<br><br>
and the like. However, the compound disclosed specifically is only a compound wherein A and B are chloro and R is chlorophenyl, in addition, the test results for insecticidal activity of these compounds are not described therein. On the other hand, the insecticidal activities of the compounds represented by the formula:<br><br>
are specifically disclosed in J. Agr. Food Chem., Vol.21, No.3, 1973, 348-354. In WO 99/16316 and WO 97/45017, an invention of use wherein the compounds disclosed in the above-mentioned document and JP 46-6550A are used for soybean and cotton, respectively, is disclosed.<br>
Further, in WO 01/14373, the compound represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein, X represents CH or N, Y represents a halogen-atom,  R1 and R2 represent independently an optionally halogenated aryl group andthe like, is disclosed as an<br><br>
insecticide.<br>
In JP 51-5648OA,  the compound represented by the<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein, A and B represent a halogen atom and the like, Ri and R2 represent  independently a hydrogen atom,  a halogen atom and the like, is disclosed as an insecticide. Furthermore,   in   JP   60-11482A,   the   compound represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein, R1represents a substituted phenyl and the like, R2 represents an alkyl or aryl, R3 represents a nitrile and the like, is disclosed as a herbicide.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In each of the above-mentioned known arts, only a spray treatment is disclosed as application, of insecticide. However, if soil treatment and seed treatment for crops are made possible, it can make a significant contribution to the laborsaving  in agriculture and improvement  of<br><br>
safety in workers and environment. Thus, the main purpose of the present invention is to provide a new insecticide useful for each of spray treatment, soil treatment and seed treatment.<br>
The present inventors variously studied a compound useful as an insecticide, and found out that the compounds represented by the following formula (I) have an insecticidal activity by spray treatment as well as a potent insecticidal activity by irrigation treatment of pesticide solution and these compounds have systemic action (penetration and translocation ability).<br>
As a treatment method for crops, a spray treatment is used for an insecticidal ingredient having no systemic action (penetration and translocation ability). However, when an insecticidal ingredient has permeable translocation ability, not only spray treatment for crops but also soil treatment and seed treatment are made possible. Here, the spray treatment means a treatment that exerts an effect by treating plant surface and insect body with an active ingredient, such as foliage application, spraying to tree ; trunk, and the like. Further, in this specification, the soil treatment means treatment to planting holes (planting hole spraying, soil-incorporation after planting hole treatment), plant foot treatment (plant foot spraying, plant  foot  soil-incorporation,  plant  foot  irrigation,<br><br>
plant foot treatment at latter half of raising seeding period), planting furrow treatment (planting furrow spraying, planting furrow soil-incorporation), planting row treatment (planting row spraying, planting row soil-incorporation, planting row spraying at growing period), planting row treatment at sowing (planting row spraying at sowing, planting row soil-incorporation at sowing), overall treatment (overall spraying, overall soil-incorporation), other spray treatment (foliar granule spraying at growing period, spraying under tree crown or around main stem, soil surface spraying, soil surface incorporation, sowing hole spraying, spraying on the ribbing ground, inter-plant spraying), other irrigation treatment (irrigation into soil, irrigation during raising seeding, injection treatment of pesticide solution, irrigation on plant foot), nursery box treatment (nursery box spraying, nursery box irrigation) , nursery tray treatment (nursery tray spraying, nursery tray irrigation), nursery bed treatment (nursery bed spraying, nursery bed irrigation, nursery bed spraying in paddy field, immersion of nursery plant), seed bed soil-incorporation treatment (seed bed soil-incorporation, seed bed soil-incorporation before sowing), other treatment (growing media incorporation, plowing, surface soil-incorporation, soil incorporation into rain dropping ,planting spot treatment,<br><br>
flower cluster granule spraying, paste fertilizer mixing) and the like as well as a treatment that exerts an effect by treating the soil with an active ingredient.<br>
In addition, the seed treatment means a treatment that exerts -an effect by treating seed with an active ingredient, such as blowing treatment, painting treatment, immersion treatment, impregnation treatment, application treatment, film coating, and the like, and also includes a treatment for seed tubers and bulbs.<br>
Furthermore the present inventors have found out that the compounds represented by the following formula (I) are useful not only as agricultural chemicals but also as pest controller in other field.

Fifteen first-instar larvae of Plutella xylostella  were set free therein, and the cup was left in a<br><br>
temperature-controlled breeding room (24°C) . On the third day after, the number of surviving Plutella xylostella was examined. The rate of dead pests was calculated by the following formula.<br>
rate of dead pests (%) = (number of dead pests, number of test pests) 1 100<br>
The result was shown in table 13.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, since the compound (I) of the present invention has a superior insecticidal activity, and also has a systemic action (penetration and translocation ability) , it can be used for soil treatment and seed treatment, and therefore can make a significant contribution to the laborsaving in agriculture and improvement of safety in workers and environment.<br><br><br><br>
