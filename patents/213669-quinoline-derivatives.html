FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel quinoline derivatives, to methods for their preparation, to compositions containing them, and to methods and use for clinical treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity such as multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis and, furthermore, diseases where pathologic inflammation plays a major role, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel quinoline derivatives suitable for the treatment of, for example, multiple sclerosis and its manifestations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Autoimmune diseases, e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis represent assaults by the body's immune system which may be systemic in nature, or else directed at individual organs in the body. They appear to be diseases in which the immune system makes mistakes and, instead of mediating protective functions, becomes the aggressor (1).<br>
MS is the most common acquired neurologic disease of young adults in Western Europe and North America. It accounts for more disability and financial loss, both in lost income and in medical care, than any other neurologic disease of this age group. There are approximately 250.000 cases of MS in the United States.<br>
Although the cause of MS is unknown, advances in brain imaging, immunology, and molecular biology have increased researchers' understanding of this disease. Several therapies<br><br>
2<br>
are currently being used to treat MS, but no single treatment has demonstrated dramatic treatment efficacy. Current treatment of MS falls into three categories: treatment of acute exacerbations, modulation of progressive disease, and therapy for specific symptoms. MS affects the central nervous system and involves a demyelination process, i.e. the myelin sheaths are lost whereas the axons are preserved. Myelin provides the isolating material that enables rapid nerve impulse conduction. Evidently, in demyelination, this property is lost. Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for MS are not understood, several lines of evidence indicate that demyelination has an immunopathologic basis. The pathologic lesions, the plaques, are characterised by infiltration of immunologically active cells such as macrophages and activated T cells (2).<br>
In US Patent No. 4,547,511 and US Patent No. 4,738,971 and in EP 59,698 some derivatives of N-aryl-l,2-dmydro-4-substimted-l-alkyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxamide are claimed as enhancers of cell-mediated immunity. The compound<br><br><br>
OH<br><br>
known as roquinimex (Merck Index 12* Ed., No. 8418; Linomide, LS2616, N-methyl-N-phenyl-l,2-dmydro-4-hydroxy-l-memyl-2-oxo-qumoline-3-carboxamide) belongs to mis series of compounds. Roquinimex has been reported to have multiple immunomodulatory activities not accompanied with general immunosuppression (3-12).<br>
Furthermore, in US Patent No. 5,580,882 quinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives are claimed to be useful in the treatment of conditions associated with MS. The particular preferred compound is roquinimex. In US Patent No. 5,594,005 quinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives are claimed to be useful in the treatment of type I diabetes. The particular preferred compound<br><br>
3<br>
is roquinimex. In WO 95/24195 quinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives are claimed to be useful in the treatment of IBD. Particularly preferred compounds are roquinimex or a salt thereof, In WO95/24196 quinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives are claimed to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis. Particularly preferred compounds are roquinimex or a salt thereof.<br>
In clinical trials comparing roquinimex to placebo, roquinimex was reported to hold promise in the treatment of conditions associated with MS (13,14). There are, however, some serious drawbacks connected to roquinimex. For example, it has been found to be teratogenic in the rat, and to induce dose-limiting side effects in man, e.g., a flu-like syndrome, which prevents from using the full clinical potential of the compound.<br>
Further, in WO 92/18483 quinoline derivatives substituted in the 6-position with a RAS (O)n-group (RA = lower alkyl or aryl; n = 0 - 2) are claimed, which possess an immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effect.<br>
The substitution, i.e., type and pattern, of the above, specifically mentioned, compounds places them outside the scope of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary objective of the present invention is to provide structurally novel quinoline compounds which by virtue of their pharmacological profile, with high potency in experimental models and low level of side-effects, are considered to be of value in the treatment of disease resulting from autoimmunity and pathologic inflammation. Examples olf such diseases are multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis and other diseases where inflammation plays a major role, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel quinoline derivatives suitable for the treatment of, for example, multiple sclerosis and its manifestations.<br><br>
4 It has now surprisingly been found that the novel compounds of general formula (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
R is selected from ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl and allyl;<br>
R4 is selected from hydrogen and pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic cations, such as<br>
sodium, potassium and calcium, and organic cations such as monoethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, dimethylaminoethanol, morpholine and the like;<br>
R5 is selected from methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, rnethoxy, ethoxy, chloro, bromo, CF3,<br>
and OCHxFy;<br>
wherein        x = 0 - 2,<br>
y = 1 - 3 with the proviso that<br>
x + y = 3; R6 is hydrogen; or R5 and R6 taken together are methylenedioxy;<br>
are unexpectedly effective and specific in the treatment of individuals suffering from autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may exist in different tautomeric forms and all such forms are included herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention R4 is hydrogen or sodium, and R5 is ethyl, methoxy, chloro or bromo, and R5 and R6 taken together are methylenedioxy, and R is ethyl or n-propyl, especially ethyl.<br><br>
5<br>
Several autoimmune diseases in man have experimental models that are spontaneously occurring in certain strains of laboratory animals or can be induced in laboratory animals by immunisation with specific antigen(s) from the target organ.<br>
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) has been the most widely used model for the human disease multiple sclerosis.<br>
Autoimmunity to type II collagen can experimentally be induced in certain strains of mice or rats and may lead to the development of polyarthritis. The collagen-induced arthritis has several features in common with the human disorder rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The hallmark of asthma in humans is an increased reactivity of the airways to a range of chemical and physical stimuli. It is now widely accepted that products released from inflammatory cells, e.g., activated eosinophils, compromise epithelial integrity and promote bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The murine model of ovalbumin (OA)-induced lung inflammation is dominated by the temporally regulated influx of lymphocytes and eosinophils into the bronchial lumen.<br>
Roquinimex has been found to induce the Beagle Pain Syndrome (BPS) (15,16) in different breeds of beagle dogs. The disease is reflected by clinical and laboratory manifestations justifying BPS as a model for the flu-like syndrome induced by roquinimex in man.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) were assayed for inhibition of EAE in mice. Roquinimex was used as treatment control and showed a 70 % inhibition at 5 mg/kg. Surprising and unexpected results were obtained when introducing proper substitution in the 5-position, e.g., 5-chloro, of the quinoline ring. In comparison with roquinimex, the potency was increased a 100-fold. Substitution in the 6-, 7-, and 8-position resulted in less active compounds. In general, the EAE activity as seen by the EAE inhibition was in the following descending order according to the position of the substitution: 5 &gt; 6 &gt;&gt; 7 = 8. The effect of the 5-substitution could largely be understood on physiochemical grounds. Moreover,<br><br>
6<br>
replacement of the methyl group on the carboxamide nitrogen with an ethyi group or further elongation of the alkyl group to a propyl or butyl group extinguished the teratogenic effect of roquinimex in the rat and significantly reduced the BPS. On the other hand, changing the R-group from alkyl to hydrogen decreased the water-solubility at physiological pH more than a 105-fold. Replacement of the alkyl group also affected the pharmacokinetic properties. For example, in comparison with roquinimex the clearance (Cl) of compound A in dogs was an 800-fold higher.<br><br>
The solubility and pharmacokinetic issues significantly reduce the useful order of activity of this class (R = H) of compounds. Hence, the compounds of formula (I) have surprisingly been found to be both chemically and pharmacologically different from those drugs hitherto suggested for the treatment of MS and its manifestations.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) are prepared by the following methods: Method A<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by known methods, for example, by reaction of an ester derivative of the quinoline carboxylic acid (II) with an aniline (III) in a suitable solvent such as toluene, xylene and the like. Suitable esters are methyl and ethyl esters.<br><br><br>
7<br>
Methods<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be prepared by reaction of an isaloic anhydride (IV) with an N-alkyl-N-phenylcarbamoyl acetic acid alkyl ester (V) using a strong base, e.g., sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylacetamide. Suitable esters are methyl and ethyl esters.<br>
Method C<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be prepared by reaction of a quinoline carboxylic acid of formula (VT) with an aniline of formula (III). Various coupling reagents known in the art may be used, e.g., carbodiimides known from US Patent No. 4,547,511. One suitable coupling method utilises thionyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. This method may be used in instances when direct coupling between ester and aniline does not work. The quinoline carboxylic acids of formula (VT) may be obtained from the corresponding esters of formula (II) by acidic hydrolysis as described below.<br>
The quinoline carboxylic esters (II) above may be prepared by the methods shown in examples 5-8 below. The quinoline carboxylic acids (VI) may be prepared by the method<br><br>
8 shown in example 9 below.<br>
All embodiments of the invention as disclosed in the claims are herewith included in the specification.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention without restricting the scope thereof.<br>

Sodium hydride (75%) (0.94 g, 1.1 eq.) followed by methyl iodide (1.89 ml, 1.2 eq.) was added at a rate to keep the temperature below 5°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 20°C for 5 hours whereupon the remaining methyl iodide was removed under vacuum. Sodium hydride (0.94 g, 1.1 eq.) was added together with N-ethyl-N-phenylcarba-moyl acetic acid ethyl ester (6.3 g, 1.1 eq.). The mixture was heated at 85°C for 5 hours. After cooling to room temperature 50 ml of methanol and 50 ml of 1M hydrochloric acid and subsequently 250 ml of water were added. An emulsion was formed which crystallised on standing in a refrigerator for 72 hours. The crystalline mass was collected by filtration, washed with water, water/methanol (1:1) and heptane and dried to afford the title compound (6.12 g).

1r2-Dihvdro-4-hydroxy-5-chloro-l-niethyl-2-oxo-ciuinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester Phosgene (51 g, 0.52 mol) dissolved in dioxane (150 ml) was added in portions to a mechanically stirred slurry of sodium bicarbonate (44 g, 0.52 mol) and 2-amino-6-chk&gt;ro-benzoic acid (30 g, 0.175 mol) in dioxane (300 ml). Violent reaction with gas evolution occurred and the reaction mixture was cooled to keep the temperature below 50°C. After 30 minutes the reaction mixture was kept at 50°C for 1 hour. After cooling to 15°C the resulting precipitate was collected, stirred with 50 ml of glacial acetic acid in 500 ml of water, collected again and dried to give the isatoic anhydride (30.3 g, 0.15 mol).<br>
The anhydride was added slowly in portions to a mixture of sodium hydride (5.5 g, 0.18 mol) in 300 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide. After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, methyl iodide (26 g, 0.18 mol) was added dropwise and stirring was continued for 2Vi hours. The mixture was then added to 3 1 of an ice/water slurry and the precipitate was collected and dried to yield the N-methylated isatoic anhydride (24.9 g, 0.118 mol).<br>
The N-methylated anhydride was heated to 65°C with sodium methoxide (6.3 g, 0.117 mol) in 130 ml of methanol for 1 hour. The solvents were evaporated. Water and dichloromethane were added and the organic layer was separated, dried and concentrated to yield an oily residue (22.7 g, 0.114 mol).<br>
The residue above was dissolved in 300 ml of dichloromethane together with 4-aminopyridine (0.2 g) and triethylamine (7.1 ml). The solution was cooled and ethyl malonyl chloride (18.9 g, 0.125 mol) was slowly added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4hours and worked up to give a syrup. To this syrup was added 450 ml of ethanol and sodium methoxide (18.5 g, 0.342 mol) and the mixture was stirred for 3 hours. The solvents were evaporated and the residue was dissolved in 750 ml of water, washed with ethyl acetate and toluene and subsequently acidified with 5 M hydrochloric acid. The resulting precipitate was collected and dried to yield the title compound as a white powder (30 g, 0.106 mol) in a total yield of 60 %.<br><br>

Pharmacological methods<br>
Acute-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis faF.AF.l<br>
SJL/N female mice, 8 weeks of age, were used for the experiments. Mouse spinal cord homogenate (MSCH) was obtained from 8 to 12 weeks-old C57B1/6 female mice. The tissue was homogenised on ice and diluted in cold PBS. Incomplete Freund's containing 1 mg/ml M. tuberculosis hominis H37Ra was emulsified with an equal volume of MSCH to give a final concentration of 10 mg/ml of MSCH. The inoculum volume of 0.1 ml was injected intradermally at the base of the tail. Pertussis toxin was injected i.p. at day 0 and 3 after immunization. Treatment was given per os daily either at day 3 to 12 post-immunization or days 3 to 7 and 10 to 12. Control animals received saline. The animals, eight per dose group, were scored for clinical signs of paralytic disease on a scale from 0 to 5 in the following way: 0, normal; 1, limp tail; 2, hind limb paresis; 3 hind limb paralysis and limp foreleg; 4, bilateral hind and fore limb paralysis; 5, death. Clinical scores were monitored at day 7 and daily from day 9 until the end of the experiment at day 14. Treatment effects were calculated as percent inhibition of clinical scores compared to saline treated controls.<br>
Collagen induced arthritis.<br>
DBA/1 male mice between 8 to 10 weeks of age were used for the experiments. On day 0 the mice were immunized intradermally at the base of the tail with bovine type II collagen (100  g/mouse) in Freund's complete adjuvant. The treatment was given per os daily on days 3 to 7,10 to 14,17 to 21,24 to 28 and 31 to 35. Fifteen days after immunization mice were inspected for signs of arthritis. The animals were inspected three times a week. Every second or third day individual paws of the arthritic animals were scored by a scale from 0-4 (0 = no arthritis, 1 = arthritis in one of the interphalangeal, metatarsophalangeal or intercarpal joints,<br><br>
19<br>
2 = two arthritic joints, 3 = three arthritic joints, 4 = as in 3 but with more severe redness and swelling of the paw). The score for each paw was added to give a maximal attainable score of 16 for each mouse.<br>
Ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation<br>
C57B1/ 6 female mice between 10 to 14 weeks of age were used for the experiments, 10 mice /group. The mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OA) in aluminium hydroxide in a volume of 0.2 ml, inoculated ip. Treatment was given at day 0 to day 16. Control mice received saline. Fourteen days after the OA sensitization mice Were exposed for 20 minutes to an aerosol of 1.5% w/v, of OA in saline produced by a nebulizer. Vehicle-challenged control mice were exposed to saline. Seventy-two hours after OA/vehicle challenge, mice were anaesthetised and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by instilling 0.5 ml ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the lungs twice. Total cell counts were determined and differential counts were made based on identification of eosinophils, monocytes/alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Eosinophil infiltration into the lung tissue was evaluated by histochemical methods on frozen lung sections using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB).<br>
Teratogenic effects in the rat<br>
The compounds were administrated subcutaneously to female rats during day 8 to 14 of pregnancy. The rats were caesarean sectioned and necropsied on day 20 after fertilisation. The foetuses were examined for external and internal abnormalities.<br>
Beagle Pain Syndrome (BPS)<br>
The compounds were administrated intravenously to beagle dogs. The dosage was given for five consecutive days. The dogs were evaluated for clinical and laboratory signs of the pain syndrome, e.g., fever, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alkaline phosphate (AP), induction of acute phase proteins and vasculitis.<br>

Effective quantities of the compounds of formula (I) are preferably administered to a patient in need of such treatment according to usual routes of administration and formulated in usual pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of the active ingredient and a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may take a variety of forms, e.g. solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, capsules, and powders prepared for oral administration, sterile solutions for parental administration, suppositories for rectal administration or suitable topical formulations. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described, for example, in "Pharmaceuticals - The Science of Dosage Form Design", M.B. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988.<br>
A suitable daily dose for use in the treatment of MS is contemplated to vary between 0.0005 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg body weight, in particular between 0.005 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight, depending upon the specific condition to be treated, the age and weight of the specific patient, and the specific patient's response to the medication. The exact individual dosage, as well as the daily dosage, will be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of a physician.<br><br>
22<br>
Various additives to enhance the stability or ease of administration of the drug are contemplated. The pharmaceutical composition may also contain additional therapeutically useful substances other than a compound of formula (I).<br>
