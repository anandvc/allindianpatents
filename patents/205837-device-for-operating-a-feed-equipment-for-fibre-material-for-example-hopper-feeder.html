				<td>Device for operating a feed equipment for fibre material for example hopper feeder.<br>
The invention relates to a device for operating a feed equipment for fibre material as for example hopper feeder, in which a needie table (needle conveyor) is present with a needle carrying item circulating endlessly around a guiding roll at whose upper side rows of needles are present assembled one after the other stretching over the breadth and which is inclined to upward in delivery direction, in doing so a weighing equipment with a weighing machine container is post assembled to the needle table.<br>
The exact proportioning of different fibre material components in fibre preparation takes place in practice frequently through automatic hopper feeder. As a rule for each material component an automatic hopper feeder is available at disposal in doing so the material transport for weighing equipment takes place preferably over a needle table in which one after the other over the breadth rows of needles are present which are directed axis parallel in relation to the guide rolls of needle table (spiked feed lattice). The circumferencial speed of needle table is varied in dependence to the filling load in weighing machine container. The reason for this speed change lies in the exact proportioning through less circumferencial speed shortly before reaching of reference weight in weighing machine container. Inspite of this measure an intermittent depositing of fibre materials takes place to the comb place working parallel to the needle bar.  Through this there<br><br>
2.<br>
arises particularly in cases of high productions danger of weighment inaccuracies,( since larger material amounts lie preferably on the, needle bars.<br>
The assignment therefore lies at the base of invention to provide a device of the type described at the entry, which avoids the mentioned disadvantages which permits particularly in simple design way a considerable improvement of weighing accuracy.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place through the  characteristic features, <br>
The abrupt supply of total fibre material load of needle bar is avoided through the not axis parallel arrangement of rows of needle that means the delivery of fibre materials of a row of,needle is stretched period wise,, which makes pos'sible an essentially more accurate proportioning of , filling of weighing machine. Specially in high productions through this measures an advantage arises since the operational run in sufficiently accurate proportioning claim less time and the number of weighing machine filling per minute is increased.<br>
Purposefully the needles are brought on needle carrying item as for example a spiked feed lattice or the equivalent and the selvedges are fastened to the needle carrying item. With advantage the selvedges are made out of wood. Favourably the selvedges comprise of an aluminium extrusion profile. Purposefully the selvedges show in delivery direction a breadth of approximately 50 to 100mm. Preferably the rows of needle are built throughgoing .  over the breadth. With advantage adjacent to each other at least two rows of<br><br>
3.<br>
needles are present assembled over the breadth dislocated to each other in delivery direction. Preferably one striping roller is assigned to the needle conveyor in area of upper guide roll. Purposefully the stripping roller and the upper guide roll show oppositely set direction of rotation. Preferably the stripping roller is assembled between the upper guide roll and the filling opening of weighing machine container. With advantage an evener roller is allocated to the needle conveyor in area of upper guide roll. Preferably the evener roller and the upper guide roll show the same direction of rotation. Purposefully the drive equipment for the needle table remains in combination with a, control-and regulating equipment, which controls the speed of drive equipment. Preferably the drive equipment for the needle table and the measuring equipment of the weighing device are connected to a common control - and regulating equipment. With advantage the angle  amounts in through going needle series approximately to 2 to 4°. Preferably the angle ß amounts in two dislocated needle series approximately 4 to 15°. Purposefully the speed v1 of spiked feed,lattice amounts in quick movement to approximately 30 to 40 m/min. Preferably the speed V2 of spiked feed lattice in fine process (proportioning process) is smaller than approximately 0.3 m/min. With advantage the breadth of needle table (spiked feed lattice) amounts to about 1600 mm. Preferably the length of selvedge amounts in through going rows of needle to about 160mm. Purposefully in two dislocated rows of needle each roW of needle stretches in direction of breadth over about 800mm.<br>

As per Fig.l a device for operating of a feed equipment for fibre material,, for example Truetzschler weighing bale opener BOW,, a. support table 16_ with a retention roll 21 to which' a; supply table 1 in shape of a conveyor belt circulating endlessly in direction A,, B,, inclined oblique to upward is post assembled. The supply table feeds the fibre material a needle table (see Fig.5,lPosition 15) represented symbolically through an arrow F, which is made out of a spiked feea lattice 2C circulating endlessly from a direction C, D around a guide roll 2a, 2b. The guide rolls 2a, 2b rotate in direction of arrow 2' or rather 2  (see<br><br>
Fig. 5). Through the needle 5 the fibre material F is delivered in direction C and guided around the upper guide roll 2a. The upper guide roll 2a is post assembled to a stripping roller horizontally whose direction of rotation 6a runs oppositely set to the direction of rotation 2 of guide roll 2a- The stripping roller 6 is provided with a needle 6b and strips down the fibre material F from the spiked feed lattice 2, delivers it along a guide 22 in direction to a filling space which is lockable through two shut-off valves 9. In opened shut-off valves 9 the fibre material F falls from above in the weighing machine container 11 of a post assembled weighing machine 10. The lower discharge opening of weighing machine container is lockable through two bottom valves 12, in opened bottom valves 12 the fibre material F falls on a mixing table 13.<br>
Corresponding to Figure 2 the needle table 2 is made out of a spiked feed lattice 3 at nrliose external side in direction of arrows C and D (direction of running of spiked feed lattice 3)— that means perpendicular in relation to axis of guide rolls 2a and 2b — assembled one after the other a multiple number of needle bars 4 stretch over the breadth a of spiked feed lattice 3. The length 1 of for example 1&amp;00 mm of needle bar 4 corresponds  to belt width a- The breadth b of needle bar  4  can<br>
amount  to 100mm. The needles 5 are brought on the needle bars  4<br>
o in each case in a straight row through going under an angle of 3<br><br>
-5A-<br>
in relation to the vertical axes of guide rolls 2a or rather 2b.<br>
As per Fig. 3 needle bars 4 are present over the breadth a of  spiked feed lattice 3, in doing so over the breadth a —  that means in direction of length 1 of needle bars 4-<br><br>
6.<br>
adjacent to each other two rows with needles 5 (needle rows) in running direction C,, D of spiked feed lattice 3 assembled dislocated to each other are provided. Each of both the rows with needle 5 is brought under an angle ß of 15° in relation to the. vertical axis of guide rolls 2a or rather 2b. With b the breadth and with 1 the length of needle bars 4 are denoted.<br>
As per Fig. 4-a a spiked feed lattice 3 is present, on which directly the needles 5 are brought. A multiple number of rows of needles are present,, which stretch throughgoirig over the breadth a of needle cloth 3 and run under a lead angle in relation to guide rolls 2a, 2b. Fig. 4b shows that the needles 5 are inclined in running direction C or rather D under an angle  of 45 in relation to the spiked feed lattice 3 towards front. The height h of needles amounts to.25 mm. above a needle bar 4.<br>
Corresponding to Fig.5 the controllable drive motor 17 is allocated to the guide roll la of supply table 1 and the controllable drive motor 18 is allocated to the guide roll<br>
r<br>
2b of needle table 2. the drive motors 17 and 18 remain in combination with an electronic control and regulating equipment 19. Besides a weight measuring equipment of. weighing machine 10 is connected over an evaluation equipment 20 to the control and regulating equipment 19. In rapid travel the spiked feed lattice of needle table 2 circulates with a speed of as for example 30 m/min. In fine going, in the proportioning of filling of fibre materials-in weighing machine container 11, the spiked feed lattice circulates with less than 0.3 m/min. Through the assembly of rows of needles 5 as per invention in each case only one part is reduced by rows of needle and not the whole fibre<br><br>
7.<br>
material and is filled in the weighing machine container so that the fine proportioning in slow process is improved considerably through the filling of only small fibre amounts.<br>
With 23, a needle row is denoted- The line between the needles 5 provide the, oblique running direction of needle row 23.<br><br>
