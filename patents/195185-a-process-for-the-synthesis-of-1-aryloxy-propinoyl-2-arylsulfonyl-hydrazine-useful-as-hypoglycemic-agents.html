				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of l-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2-arylsulfonyl hydrazines useful as hypoglycemic agents. The present invention also relates to the synthesis of l-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2arylsulfonyl hydrazines as new hypoglycemic agents which may be useful in the treatment of diabetes.<br>
Introduction of more clinically effective hypoglycemic agents has been followed invariably by the rapid emergence of resistant antidiabetic drugs leading to increasing demand for new and potent hypoglycemic drugs. Acquisition of resistance has seriously reduced the therapeutic value of many known drugs including antidiabetics and has become a major stimulus to look for new moieties. Hence, the best approach is to look for new molecules structurally different from the existing drugs. The present invention relates to such an effort in developing title compounds as new hypoglycemic agents. These have not so far been investigated for the hypoglycemic activity and all compounds described are new molecules reported for the first time.<br>
Reference may be made to Indian Drugs, 17, 315, 1980, wherein, authors have syhthesized arylsulfonyl hydrazines as hypoglycemic agents. The drawbacks are that no substitutions were made to the hydrazine group which can improve the hppoglycemic activity. Incorporation of aryloxyalkyl substituents to organic moieties has been found to result in compounds which possess enhanced biological profile. Reference may also be made to Indian.J. Chem:27B, 1057-1059, 1988, wherein authors have introduced substitutions by condensation of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic and isobutyric acid hydrazides with arylsulfonyl chlorides.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide l-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2-arylsulfonyl hydrazines which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of 1-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2-arylsulfonyl hydrazines as potential hypoglycemic agents.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to unravel new hypoglycemic molecules structurally different from the known drugs such as Glibenclamide, Tolbutamide, Chloropropamide, Phenformin, Metformin, etc.<br>
In the present invention, aryloxypropionic acid hydrazides were reacted with arylsulfonyl chlorides to obtain the title compounds as hypoglycemic agents for the first time.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the synthesis of 1-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2-arylsulfonyl hydrazine of the formula useful as hypoglycemic agents of the formula<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention the aryloxy group used is selected from the group consisting of 4-chlorophenoxy, 3-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy and 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy groups.<br>
In an another embodiment the aryl group is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, 4-chlorophenyl and 4-tolyl.<br>
In yet another embodiment the compounds l-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2-arylsulfonyl hydrazine is useful hypoglycemic agents.<br>
In yet another embodiment the compound l-(aryloxy)propionoyl-2-arylsulfonyl<br>
hydrazine obtained is comprising the group of l-(4'-chlorophenoxy)propionoyl-2-<br>

urief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the hypoglycemic activity of l-(aryloxy)propionoyl - 2- arylsulfonyl hydrazines in normoglycemic rats.<br>

Hypoglycemic activity:<br>
Typical representative members of this invention have shown hypoglycemic activity for the first time both in normoglycemic and Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats compared to standard drug. The standard drug used in both the experimental animal evaluation is Glibenclamide. The experimental details are given below.<br>
Hypoglycemic activity in normal rats:<br>
Wistar rats of either sex weighing 150-180 gms were fasted overnight and divided into control, standard and test groups each consisting of 6 rats. The standard drug, Glibenclamide, was administered in the dose of 5 mg/kg per oral to the rats. All test compounds were administered in the dose of 200 mg/kg per oral to the test groups. Both standard and test drugs were administered as 1% gum acacia suspension. Control group received vehicle only. Blood glucose levels were measured before drugs administration at 0 hr and at 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr after drugs administration. Percent reduction of blood glucose levels at different time intervals was calculated with reference to basal glucose levels. All the blood glucose estimations were done using GOD/POD method and were analyzed using Auto Blood Analyzer (Technicon RA-1000, Bayer Diagnostics, Ireland). The standard drug (Glibenclamide) has shown a percent inhibition of glucose 65.1 and all the test compounds (1 to 9 examples) have shown percent inhibition in range of 48.5 to 63.2 (Fig. 1) Hypoglycemic activity in Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats:<br>
Wistar rats of either sex weighting 150-180 gms were used in this study and were divided into control, standard and test groups each consisting of 6 rats. Basal glucose levels were taken for all rats. Diabetes was induced by administering Streptozotocin in the dose of 50 mg/kg intravenously to the rats in all the groups. After a period of 48 hrs glucose levels were again measured and rats that have shown glucose levels of 400 i^20 mg/dl were selected. Glibenclamide (lmg/kg) and the test compounds (50 mg/kg) were administered as 1% gum acacia suspension daily for a period of 14 days. At the end of 14 days after the last does, blood glucose levels were again measured and the percent reduction in blood glucose was measured for all the rats in all the groups with respect to the initial reading before drugs administration. The standard drug has shown hypoglycemic activity expressed as percent inhibition of blood glucose levels as 68.2 whereas test compounds (examples 1-9) has shown hypoglycemic activity in the range of 43.5 to 59.3 (Fig. 2).<br>
