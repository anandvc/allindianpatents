				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a pouch having at least two compartments, said pouch comprises a composition comprising a solid component and a liquid component, said solid and liquid components are contained in different compartments.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Laundry detergent products can be found on the market to date in various forms, such as solid granular compositions and tablets, or liquid compositions. This gives the consumer a choice of detergent products they can use.<br>
Some detergent ingredients currently used by the laundry industry, are preferably manufactured and processed in solid form, for example because these ingredients are water-insoluble and are difficult or costly to include in a liquid detergent composition, or because these materials are preferably transported and supplied in solid form and therefore require extra processing steps to enable them to be included in a liquid detergent composition. Such detergent ingredients include surfactants, hence these surfactants require extra processing steps to enable them to be included in liquid detergent compositions. Also, certain ingredients are formed into granular form and supplied and processed in solid form for stability reasons, for example certain enzyme prills.<br>
Current methods of incorporating water-insoluble solid ingredients and ingredients typically supplied in solid form such as surfactants, into liquid detergent compositions include the use of emulsifiers, and dispersants. However, these liquid detergent compositions comprise only low amounts of these solid ingredients. For example, liquid detergent ingredients can comprise only low amounts of certain water-insoluble building<br>
agents such as aluminosilicates or water-insoluble fabric softening agents such as clays, provided dispersants or emulsifiers are used.<br>
However, it is desirable to include higher levels of water-insoluble solid ingredients such as water-insoluble building agents in a detergent composition with a substantial amount of liquid detergent ingredients. It is also desirable to be able to incorporate detergent ingredients that are typically transported in solid form, including granules comprising surfactants, in to a detergent composition comprising a substantial amount of liquid ingredients without the need for extra costly and difficult processing steps.<br>
The inventors have found that by using a multi-compartment water-soluble pouch comprising at least two separate compartments, water-insoluble solid detergent ingredients can be included in a detergent composition comprising other liquid detergent ingredients, without the need for difficult, costly manufacturing and processing steps. The water-insoluble solid detergent ingredient is comprised by one compartment of a multi-compartment water-soluble pouch whilst the liquid detergent ingredients are comprised by another compartment of said pouch. Detergent compositions comprised by a multi-compartment water-soluble pouch in this way can comprise higher levels of water-insoluble solid detergent ingredients such as water insoluble building agent together with liquid detergent ingredients.<br>
The inventors have also found that by using a multi-compartment water-soluble pouch comprising at least two separate compartments, detergent ingredients that are usually transported and supplied to the detergent manufacturers in solid form, such as agglomerates comprising surfactants, can be included in a detergent composition comprising substantial amounts of liquid detergent ingredients, without the need for difficult, costly manufacturing and processing steps. The solid detergent ingredients are comprised by one compartment of a multi-compartment water-soluble pouch whilst the liquid detergent ingredients are comprised by another compartment of said pouch.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, a multi-compartment pouch made from a water-soluble film and having at least two compartments, said multi-compartment pouch comprises a composition comprising a solid component and a liquid component, wherein;<br>
(a)	a first compartment comprises a solid component comprising (by weight of the solid<br>
component) at least 10% water-insoluble solid material; and<br>
(b)	a second compartment comprises a liquid component.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, a multi-compartment pouch made from a water-soluble film and having at least two compartments, said multi-compartment pouch comprises a composition comprising a solid component and a liquid component, wherein;<br>
(a)	a first compartment comprises a solid component comprising (by weight of the solid<br>
I<br>
component) at least 15% particles which contain at least 20% by weight of the particle of surfactant; and<br>
(b)	a second compartment comprises a liquid component.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention Multi-compartment pouch and materials thereof<br>
The multi-compartment pouch of the invention, herein referred to as "pouch", comprises at least two, preferably two compartments.<br>
The pouch herein is typically a closed structure, made of. materials described herein, enclosing a volume space which is separated into at least two compartments. The pouch comprises a composition comprising a liquid component and a solid component. The pouch and volume space thereof, can be of any form, shape and material which is suitable to hold the composition, e.g. without allowing the release of the composition from the pouch prior to contact of the pouch to water. The exact execution will depend on for example the type and amount of the composition in the pouch, the number of compartments in the pouch, the characteristics required from the pouch to hold, protect and deliver or release the compositions. Preferably, the pouch has a spheroid shape.<br>
The pouch may be of such a size that it conveniently contains either a unit dose amount of the composition herein, suitable for the required operation, for example one wash, or only a partial dose, to allow the consumer greater flexibility to vary the amount used, for example depending on the size and/ or degree of soiling of the wash load.<br>
The pouch is made from a water-soluble film which encloses an inner volume, said inner volume is divided into the compartments of the pouch.<br>
The compartments of the pouch herein typically are closed structures made of a water-soluble film which encloses a volume space which comprises the components of the detergent composition. Said volume space is preferably enclosed by a water-soluble film in such a manner that the volume space is separated from the outside environment.<br>
The solid component or liquid component that are comprised by a compartment of the pouch are contained in the volume space of the compartment, and are separated from the outside environment by a water-soluble film.<br>
The term "separated" means for the purpose of this invention "physically distinct, in that a first ingredient comprised by a compartment is prevented from contacting a second ingredient if said second ingredient is not comprised by the same compartment which comprises said first ingredient".<br>
The term "outside environment" means for the purpose of this invention "anything which cannot pass through the material which encloses the compartment and which is not comprised by the compartment".<br>
The compartment is suitable to hold the solid or liquid components of the composition, e.g. without allowing the release of the components from the compartment prior to contact of the pouch to water. The compartment can have any form or shape, depending on the nature of the material of the compartment, the nature of the components or composition, the intended use, amount of the components etc.<br>
It may be preferred that the compartment which comprises the liquid component also comprises an air bubble, preferably the air bubble has a volume of no more than 50%, preferably no more than 40%, more preferably no more than 30%, more preferably no more than 20%, more preferably no more than 10% of the volume space of said compartment. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of the air bubble increases the tolerance of the pouch to the movement of liquid component within the compartment, thus reducing the risk of the liquid component leaking from the compartment.<br>
The pouch is made from a water-soluble film, said water-soluble film typically has a solubility of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured by<br>
i<br>
the method set out hereinafter using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 50 microns, namely:<br>
Gravimetric method for determining water-solubility of the material of the compartment and/or pouch:<br>
10 grams ±0.1 gram of material is added in a 400 ml beaker, whereof the weight has been determined, and 245ml ± 1ml of distilled water is added. This is stirred vigorously on magnetic stirrer set at 600 rpm, for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture is filtered through a folded qualitative sintered-glass filter with the pore sizes as defined above (max. 50 micron). The water is dried off from the collected filtrate by any conventional method, and the weight of the remaining polymer is determined (which is the dissolved or dispersed fraction). Then, the % solubility or dispersability can be calculated.<br>
Preferred films are polymeric materials, preferably polymers which are formed into a film or sheet. The material in the form of a film can for example be obtained by casting, blow-moulding, extrusion or blow extrusion of the polymer material, as known in the art.<br>
Preferred polymer copolymers or derivatives thereof are selected from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides, acrylamide, acrylic acid, cellulose, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, cellulose amides, polyvinyl acetates, polycarboxylic<br>
acids and salts, polyaminoacids or peptides, polyamides, polyacrylamide, copolymers of maleic/acrylic acids, polysaccharides including starch and gelatine, natural gums such as xanthum and carragum. More preferably the polymer is selected from polyacrylates and water-soluble acrylate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, most preferably polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Preferably, the level of polymer in the film, for example a PVA polymer, is at least 60%.<br>
The polymer can have any weight average molecular weight, preferably from about 1000 to 1,000,000, or even form 10,000 to 300,000 or even form 15,000 to 200,000 or even form 20,000 to 150,000.<br>
Mixtures of polymers can also be used. This may in particular be beneficial to control the mechanical and/or dissolution properties of the compartment or pouch, depending on the application thereof and the required needs. For example, it may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is present in the material of the compartment, whereby one polymer material has a higher water-solubility than another polymer material, and/or one polymer material has a higher mechanical strength than another polymer material. It may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is used, having different weight average molecular weights, for example a mixture of PVA or a copolymer thereof of a weight average molecular weight of 10,000- 40,000, preferably around 20,000, and of PVA or copolymer thereof, with a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 to 300,000, preferably around 150,000.<br>
Also useful are polymer blend compositions, for example comprising hydrolytically degradable and water-soluble polymer blend such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, achieved by the mixing of polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, typically comprising 1-35% by weight polylactide and approximately from 65% to 99% by weight polyvinyl alcohol, if the material is to be water-dispersible, or water-soluble.<br>
It may be preferred that the polymer present in the film is from 60-98% hydrolysed, preferably 80% to 90%, to improve the dissolution of the film.<br>
Most preferred films are films which comprise a PVA polymer with similar properties to the film which comprises a PVA polymer and is known under the trade reference M8630, as sold by Chris-Craft Industrial Products of Gary, Indiana, US.<br>
The film herein may comprise other additive ingredients than the polymer or polymer material. For example, it may be beneficial to add plasticisers, for example glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and mixtures thereof, additional water, disintegrating aids. It may be useful when the composition herein is a detergent composition, that the film itself comprises a detergent additive to be delivered to the wash water, for example organic polymeric soil release agents, dispersants, dye transfer inhibitors.<br>
The compartment and preferably pouch as a whole are made from water-soluble material. Suitable examples of commercially available water-soluble materials include polyvinyl alcohol and partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate, alginates, cellulose ethers such as carboxymethylcellulose and methylcellulose, polyethylene oxide, polyacrylates and combinations of these.<br>

Examples Example I<br>
A piece of plastic is placed in a mould to act as a false bottom. The mould consists of a cylindrical shape and has a diameter of 45mm and a depth of 25mm. A 1mm thick layer of rubber is present around the edges of the mould. The mould has some holes in the mould material to allow a vacuum to be applied. With the false bottom in place the depth of the mould is 12mm. A piece of Chris-Craft M-8630 film is placed on top of this mould and fixed in place. A vacuum is applied to pull the film into the mould and pull the film flush with the inner surface of the mould and the false bottom. 5ml of the liquid component of a detergent composition is poured into the mould. Next, a second piece of Chris-Craft M-8630 film is placed over the top of the mould with the liquid component<br>
and sealed to the first piece of film by applying an annular piece of flat metal of an inner diameter of 46mm and heating that metal under moderate pressure onto the ring of rubber at the edge of the mould to heat-seal the two pieces of film together to form a compartment comprising the liquid component. The metal ring is typically heated to a temperature of from l35oC to 150oC and applied for up to 5 seconds.<br>
The compartment comprising the liquid compartment is removed from the mould and the piece of plastic acting as a false bottom is also removed from the mould. A third piece of Chris-Craft M-8630 film is placed on top of the mould and fixed in place. A vacuum is applied to pull the film into the mould and pull the film flush with the inner surface of the mould. 40g of the solid component of the detergent composition is poured into the mould. Next, the compartment comprising the liquid component is placed over the top of the mould with the solid component and is sealed to the third layer of film by applying an annular piece of flat metal of an inner diameter of 46mm and heating that metal under moderate pressure onto the ring of rubber at the edge of the mould to heat-seal the pieces of film together to form a pouch comprising two compartments, where a first compartment comprises the liquid component of the detergent composition and a second compartment comprises the solid component of the detergent composition. The metal ring is typically heated to a temperature of froml35oC to 150oC and applied for up to 5 seconds.<br>
