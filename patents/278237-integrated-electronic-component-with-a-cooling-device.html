Integrated electronic component as well as cooling device for an integrated electronic component<br>
State of art of technology<br>
The invention relates to an integrated electronic component as well as a cooling device for an integrated electronic component as per the generic description of the independent claims.<br>
Integrated electronic components customarily include at least one printed circuit board, electronic power components provided on the printed circuit board as well as a housing which at least partially surrounds the PCB. What is problematic is the de-heating of the power components. The de-heating is made further more difficult through more compact designs as well as a higher packing density in the housing. According to the state of art of technology, the power components of integrated electronic components, especially those for the two-dimensional SMD-assembly ("surface mounted device-assembly"), are mostly metallically de-heated through the PCB into the housing. In this context the heat flow is improved through the PCB with the so-called thermal Vias. These are small bores or blind holes, brought about with the use of laser technology or mechanically with a micro drill, and are used for the purpose of conducting the heat. In order to enhance the heat conductivity, the Vias are copper plated. One bottom side of the PCB is coupled in the process directly beneath the power elements, to the housing, in order to deflect the heat as rapidly as possible to the housing. For the evaluation of the heat conduction, the so-called thermal resistance is made use of, which under a given dissipation loss indicates the temperature differential between the start and end of the heat path. The thermal resistance is measured in k/w and is composed of the thermal resistances of the segments of the path, which the heat flow must withstand. For minimizing the thermal transitional resistance, from the PCB in the housing, it is known that a heat conducting medium in form of a paste, an adhesive or a foil is brought in between the PCB and the housing. The disadvantage here is that on the bottom side of the PCB no component can be placed. Further, the structure described above as the effect that the intermediate layers are broken / interrupted through the thermal vias. This results in an additional disadvantage of the layout with respect to wiring and placing of power components.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
In an integrated electronic component in accordance with the invention, a PCB has at least one inner layer made of a material capable of conducting heat. The big advantage in this context is the beneficial de-heating from the power developing components to the housing which is located on the PCB.    In a<br>
 <br>
preferred further development, the inner layer is formed out of massive copper. The PCB has two inner layers in an especially preferred design. The most advantageous thickness of copper - inner layers are recommended to be of a layer thickness, for example, of 105 urn, 210 or 400 m. The inner layers can be preferably structured (etched).<br>
The power components can be thermally coupled with the inner layers through at least one contact opening located transverse to the PCB, to evacuate the heat generated by the power components in the inner layers. A through contact in form of a bow can be designed as a preferred contact opening, vertical to the PCB. In a specially preferred design, a blind hole (u.-via and /or Microvia) is designed as the contact opening, preferably laser drilled. A u-via through a standard PCB has for example, a thermal resistance of about 200 k/w. Depending upon the requirement, a corresponding number of u-vias is arranged parallel in the PCB. The big advantage thereby is tat on the bottom side of the PCB, power components can be placed. Thereby, a very beneficial de-coupling is achieved between a housing design and layout, and the additional usable PCBs surface can be usefully enhanced.<br>
For thermal deflection from the inner layers into the housing, a clamping border / border is preferably designed, where the warmth / heat is evacuated through a cross line of the inner layers, to the clamping border / frame. Happily, under this design, the power components need no longer be located directly upper half of a coupling surface between the housing and the PCB, which facilities an additional free structuring /configuration in the placing of the components.<br>
If the PCB has in the area of the clamping border, minimum one contact opening arranged cross-verse to the PCB, then an especially advantageous heat deflection can take place. Ideally, for electronic insulation of the inner layers towards the outer, a material made of filled organic Substrate is visualized, which possesses improved heat conductivity. A so-called Prepared can especially be proposed. It is an adhesive foil for example an epoxy-resin-impregnated and pre-polymerized glass hard adhesive foil for assembling multi-layer PCBs, which has usually a heat conductivity of minimum 1 W/mK. Necessitated through the good flow behavior, all intermediate space is filled air-free, and an ideal binding and solid adhesion of the prepare layers and inner layers is obtained. An electrical insulation under simultaneous good thermal conductivity is guaranteed with the use of this preferred layer construction.<br>
In an invention based cooling device for an integrated electronic component, the PCB has at least one inner layer made of a heat conducting material, for the purpose of deflecting heat from the power components, where ideally two inner layers made of massive copper are designed. Even other heat conducting materials could however be used as the inner layers, for example, aluminum coal. For thermal coupling of the power elements with the inner layers, or the inner layers to the housing, a contact opening arranged cross-verse to the PCB<br>
 <br>
is ideally designed, for example in form of through contacts in the shape of drills, or in the shape of blind holes (u.-vias). The latter, has the advantage that even at the bottom side of the PCB power elements can be placed. For deflecting the heat from the inner layers to the housing at clamping border/frame is preferably<br>
designed.<br>
On the whole, as part of adapted / matched equipment conception, a more compact assembly possibility is presented with the invention based component or the invention based cooling device, where however, a comparable, reliable and /or even an improved de-heating takes place. An advantageous gain in space on the PCB is also especially interlinked with the suggested solution. The invention based solutions have moreover the advantage of providing an independent cooling concept, because the clamping border defines the cooling concept. The suggested solutions can be especially used in all motor control instruments in the PCB technology.<br>

 <br>
Description of the design examples<br>
in figures 1 to 6, alternative design forms of an invention based integrated electronics component 17 is shown respectively in sectional illustration. Same elements in the figures are identified with the same reference numbers. The integrated electronic component 10 includes respectively a PCB 10 especially a multilayer PCB 10, an electronic power component 11 provided on the PCB 10 as well as a housing, not illustrated, which surrounds the PCB 10 at least partially. The PCB 10 has respectively two structural inner layers 12 made of a heat conducting material, where the inner layers 12 are formed respectively out of massive copper. The power components 11 can be thermally coupled with the inner layers 12 respectively through contact openings 13 provided cross-ward to the PCB 10, where a de-heating of the power components 11 takes place. For thermal deflection from the inner layers 12 into the housing a clamping border 16 is respectively designed, whereby the de-heating is obtained through a cross-ward line 18 of both the inner layers 12 to the clamping border 16. The clamping border 16 surrounds at least partially an outer edge of the PCB 10 and primarily has a U-shape with free / open sides 20, 20', sticking out from an upper side 21 and a bottom side 22 of the PCB 10. A material made of filled organic Substrate is intended for electric insulation of the inner layer 12 towards the outer, especially a prepare layer 19.<br>
Through contacts are intended in figure 1 for de-heating the power components •11; these are especially contact openings 13 arranged parallel in the form of continuous bores / drills 14, arranged cross-ward, to the PCB 10. The PCB 10 in figure 1 is fitted on one side at the upper side 21 with a power component 11.<br>
The contact openings 13 in figure 2 are designed as blind holes 15 (uvias). Heat of the power components 11 is evacuated to the inner layers 12 and further through the cross lines 18 of the inner layers 12 to the clamping border 16 through the blind hole 15, where through the heat conducting organic prepare layer 19 the heat is discharged towards the outer. This design / assembly enables an advantageous fitting of power components 11, 11' on the upper side 21 and the bottom side 22 of the PCB 10.<br>
Figure 3 shows a variant of the design form in figure 1, which corresponds mostly to the assembly of the illustration in figure 1. What is different is that the PCB 10 in the design form illustrated in figure 3 has in the area of the clamping border 16, a contact opening 13 in form of a board 14 arranged across PCB 10. This assembly is restricted to the power components 11 which need not be built from power-free.<br>
 <br>
In a variant of figure 3 the PCB 10 in figure 4 has in the area of the clamping border 16 a contact opening 13 in form of a blind hole 15 each cross-ward to the PCB 10, which is drilled both from the upper side 21 of the PCB 10 as well as from the bottom side 22 of the PCB 10 towards the inner, and through which the de-heating of the inner layers 12 happens through the clamping border 16 to the housing.<br>
In figure 5 another alternative design form of figure 1 is illustrated. For de-heating the power components 11 to the inner layers 12, through-contacts are proposed, especially parallel contact openings 13 in form of continuous bores 14 arranged cross-ward to the PCB 10. Moreover, a de-heating of the inner layers 12 to the housing is obtained through an additional through-contact designed as bore 14 along a cross line 18 to the clamping border 16. With this suggested solution, the thermal transition resistance from the PCB 10 into the housing is again minimized, so that a two-side fitting of the PCB with the power component<br>
11,	11'is facilitated.<br>
Another alternative which presents a possibility for equipping the PCB 10 based power components 11, 11' on an upper side and a lower side 20, 22, is shown in figure 6. The heat generated in the power components 11, 11' is deflected /evacuated through contact openings 13 in form of bores 14 to the inner layers<br>
12.	The heat transfer from the inner layers 12 to the housing takes place through<br>
a cross line 18 of the inner layers 12 to the clamping border 16. With the help of<br>
the clamping border 16, the thermal transition resistance is reduced to such an<br>
extent that a two-side fitting of the PCB 10 with power components 11 is made<br>
possible.<br>
<br>
