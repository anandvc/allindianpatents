				<td>Substituted quinolones<br>
The invention relates to substituted quinolones and to processes for their preparation<br>
as well as to their use for the production of medicaments for the treatment and/or<br>
prophylaxis of diseases, especially for use as antiviral agents, particularly against<br>
cytomegaloviruses.<br>
WO 00/040561 and US 4,959,363 describe quinolones with activity against viruses of<br>
the herpes family. EP-A 612731 describes quinolones as antiviral agents, particularly<br>
against HIV. WO 02/009758, WO 02/085886 and WO 03/050107 claim quinolones as<br>
broad-spectrum antibiotics. WO 97/004775 and WO 97/004779 describe quinolones<br>
as inhibitors of PDE4 and TNFα, among other things for the treatment of antiin-<br>
flammatory diseases and HIV. EP-A 276700 describes 8-cyanoquinolones as antibiot-<br>
ics. WO 02/026713 describes quinolones as antiparasitic compounds.<br><br>
2<br>
On the market there are structurally different agents having antiviral activity, but<br>
their breadth of application is severely restricted owing to a pronounced side-effect<br>
profile and a possible development of resistances. New agents for a better and more<br>
effective therapy are therefore desirable.<br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to provide new compounds with<br>
equal or improved antiviral action for the treatment of viral infectious diseases in<br>
humans and animals.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the substituted quinolones described in the<br>
present invention have antiviral activity.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of formula<br><br>

P. Sanchez, et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1995, 38(22), 4478-87.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) and (V) are known or can be synthesized by known<br>
methods from the corresponding starting materials.<br>
The compounds of formula (V) optionally carry protecting groups known to a man of<br>
the art during the reaction, which can be removed either directly after the reaction of<br>
the compounds of formula (IV) with compounds of formula (V) to compounds of<br>
formula (II) or after a further reaction to compounds of formula (Ic).<br>
The compounds of formula (IV) are known or can be synthesized according to<br>
known methods from the corresponding starting materials, as described for example<br>
in A. Da Silva, M. De Almeida, V. De Souza, M. Couri, Current Medicinal Chemistry,<br>
2003, 10, 21-39.<br>
In an alternative method substituent R2 in compounds of formula (Ic) can be intro-<br>

nucleophilic substitution in 7-position of the quinolone and the formation of the<br>
amide can be exchanged in the order of reaction.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of the invention can be illustrated with the<br>
following synthesis scheme.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention show a surprising range of effects which could not<br>
have been predicted. They show an antiviral effect on representatives of the group of<br>
herpes viridae (herpes viruses), in particular on cytomegaloviruses (CMV) and espe-<br>
cially on the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).<br>
Areas of indication which may be mentioned by way of example are:<br><br>
1)	Treatment and prophylaxis of HCMV infections in AIDS patients (retinitis,<br>
pneumonitis, gastrointestinal infections).<br>
2)	Treatment and prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infections in bone-marrow and<br>
organ transplant patients who develop often life-threatening HCMV pneu-<br>
monitis or encephalitis, as well as gastrointestinal and systemic HCMV infec-<br>
tions.<br>
3)	Treatment and prophylaxis of HCMV infections in neonates and infants.<br>
4)	Treatment of an acute HCMV infection in pregnant women.<br>
5)	Treatment of an HCMV infection in immunosuppressed patients during<br>
cancer and cancer therapy.<br>
6)	Treatment of HCMV-positive cancer patients with the aim of reducing HCMV-<br>
mediated tumour progression (cf. J. Cinatl , et al., FEMS Microbiology Reviews<br>
2004, 28, 59-77).<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of the compounds of the invention<br>
for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular of infections with<br>
viruses, especially the aforementioned viruses, and of the infectious diseases caused<br>
thereby. A viral infection means hereinafter both an infection with a virus and a<br>
disease caused by an infection with a virus.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of the compounds of the invention<br>
for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially of the aforementioned<br>
diseases.<br><br>
The present invention further relates to the use of the compounds of the invention<br>
for the production of a medicament for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases,<br>
especially of the aforementioned diseases.<br>
The compounds of the invention are preferably used for the production of medica-<br>
ments which are suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of infections with a<br>
representative of the group of herpes viridae, particularly a cytomegalovirus, in<br>
particular the human cytomegalovirus.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for the treatment and/or prophy-<br>
laxis of diseases, especially the aforementioned diseases, using an antivirally effective<br>
amount of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The present invention further relates to medicaments comprising at least one com-<br>
pound of the invention and at least one or more further active ingredients, in par-<br>
ticular for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the aforementioned diseases. Suitable<br>
active ingredients in the combination which may be mentioned by way of example<br>
and preferably are: antiviral active ingredients such as valganciclovir, ganciclovir or<br>
aciclovir.<br>
The compounds of the invention may act systemically and/or locally. They can for<br>
this purpose be administered in a suitable way, such as, for example, orally, parenter-<br>
ally, pulmonarily, nasally, sublingually, lingually, buccally, rectally, dermally, trans-<br>
dermally, conjunctivally, otically or topically, or as implant or stent.<br>
For these administration routes it is possible to administer the compounds of the<br>
invention in suitable administration forms.<br>
Suitable for oral administration are administration forms which function according<br>
to the prior art and deliver the compounds of the invention rapidly and/or in modi-<br>
fied fashion and which comprise the compounds of the invention in crystalline<br><br>
and/or amorphicized and/or dissolved form, such as, for example, tablets (uncoated<br>
or coated tablets, for example having coatings which are resistant to gastric juice or<br>
dissolve with a delay or are insoluble and control the release of the compound of the<br>
invention), tablets or films/wafers, which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity,<br>
films/lyophilisates, capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated<br>
tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.<br>
Parenteral administration can take place with avoidance of an absorption step (for<br>
example intravenous, intraarterial, intracardial, intraspinal or intralumbar) or with<br>
inclusion of an absorption (for example intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracutane-<br>
ous, percutaneous, or intraperitoneal). Administration forms suitable for parenteral<br>
administration are, inter alia, preparations for injection and infusion in the form of<br>
solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilisates or sterile powders.<br>
Suitable for the other administration routes are for example pharmaceutical forms for<br>
inhalation (including powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions, sprays;<br>
tablets, films/wafers or capsules, for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration,<br>
suppositories, preparations for the ears or eyes, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions<br>
(lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal<br>
therapeutic systems, milk, pastes, foams, dusting powders, implants or stents.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be converted into the stated administration<br>
forms. This can take place in a manner known per se by mixing with inert, non-<br>
toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These excipients include, inter alia,<br>
carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (for<br>
example liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersants or wetting agents<br>
(for example sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabi-<br>
lizers (for example antioxidants such as ascorbic acid), colors (for example inorganic<br>
pigments such as iron oxides) or taste- and/or odor corrigents.<br><br>
The present invention further relates to medicaments which comprise at least one<br>
compound of the invention, usually together with one or more inert, non-toxic,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and to the use thereof for the aforemen-<br>
tioned purposes.<br>
It has generally proven advantageous on intravenous administration to administer<br>
amounts of about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 5 mg/kg of body<br>
weight to achieve effective results, and the dosage on oral administration is about<br>
0.01 to 25 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the amounts<br>
mentioned, depending on the body weight, administration route, individual behav-<br>
ior towards to the active ingredient, nature of the preparation and time or interval<br>
over which administration takes place. Thus it may be sufficient in some cases to<br>
make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other<br>
cases the stated upper limit must be exceeded. In the case of an administration of<br>
larger amounts it may be advisable to divide these into a plurality of individual doses<br>
over the day.<br>
The percentage data in the following tests and examples are percentages by weight<br>
unless otherwise indicated; parts are parts by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios<br>
and concentration data of liquid/liquid solutions are in each case based on volume.<br><br>

The exemplary compounds which comprise a basic nitrogen can depending on the<br>
method of their purification be isolated as a free base or in various saltforms. The<br>
production method often describes the purification by HPLC with the addition of<br>
formic acid (method 5) which leads to the hydroformate or with the addition of<br>
other acids such as for example hydrochloric acid (method 6) instead of formic acid<br>
whereby the product is isolated as the hydrochloride. Alternatively the product can<br>
also be purified by stirring in acetonitrile or by preparative HPLC without the addi-<br>
tion of acid (method 7) whereby the product is isolated as a free base.<br>
From the free bases, as well as from the hydroformate, the hydrochloride of a com-<br>
pound can be obtained by subsequent mixing with hydrochloric acid in dioxane and<br>
evaporation on a rotary evaporator.<br><br>

B.       Assessment of the physiological activity<br>
The in vitro effect of the compounds of the invention can be shown in the following<br>
assays:<br>
Anti-HCMV (anti-human cytomegalovirus) cytopathogenicity tests<br>
The test compounds are employed as 50 millimolar (mM) solutions in dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO). Ganciclovir®, Foscarnet® and Cidofovir® are used as reference<br>
compounds. After the addition of 2 µl of the 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 mM DMSO stock<br>
solutions respectively to 98 µl portions of cell culture medium in row 2 A-H for<br>
duplicate determinations, 1:2 dilutions are carried out with 50 µl portions of medium<br>
up to row 11 of the 96-well plate. The wells in rows 1 and 12 each contain 50 µl of<br>
medium. 150 µl of a suspension of 1 x 104 cells (human prepuce fibroblasts [NHDF])<br>
are then plpetted into each of the wells (row 1 = cell control) and, in rows 2-12, a<br>
mixture of HCMV-infected and uninfected NHDF cells (M.O.I. = 0.001 - 0.002), i.e. 1-<br>
2 infected cells per 1000 uninfected cells. Row 12 (without substance) serves as virus<br>
control. The final test concentrations are 250-0.0005 µM. The plates are incubated at<br>
37°C/5% C02 for 6 days, i.e. until all the cells in the virus controls are infected (100%<br>
cytopathogenic effect [CPE]). The wells are then fixed and stained by adding a<br>
mixture of formalin and Giemsa's dye (30 minutes), washed with double-distilled<br>
water and dried in a drying oven at 50°C. The plates are then assessed visually using<br>
an overhead microscope (plaque multiplier from Technomara).<br>
The following data can be obtained from the test plates:<br>
CC50 (NHDF) = substance concentration in µM at which no visible cytostatic effects<br>
on the cells are evident by comparison with the untreated cell control;<br>
EC50 (HCMV) = substance concentration in µM which inhibits the CPE (cytopathic<br>
effect) by 50% compared with the untreated virus control;<br><br><br><br>
The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of HCMV<br>
infections can be shown in the following animal model:<br>
HCMV Xenograft Gelfoam® model<br>
Animals:<br>
5-6-week old immunodeficient mice (16-20 g), Fox Chase SCID.NOD or NOD.CB17-<br>
Prkdc/J, are purchased from commercial breeders (Taconic M&amp;B, Denmark; Jackson,<br>
USA). The animals are kept under sterile conditions (including bedding and feed) in<br>
isolators.<br>
Virus growing:<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Davis or AD169 strain, is grown in vitro on human<br>
embryonic prepuce fibroblasts (NHDF cells). After the NHDF cells have been infected<br>
with a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 0.01-0.03, the virus-infected cells are<br>
harvested 5-10 days later and stored in the presence of minimal essential medium<br>
(MEM), 20% foetal calf serum (FCS) (v/v), 1% glutamine (v/v), 1% Pen/Strep (v/v)<br>
with 10% DMSO at -80°C. After serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus-infected cells,<br>
the titer is determined on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells after fixing and<br>
staining with a Giemsa formaldehyde solution.<br>
Preparation of the sponges, transplantation, treatment and evaluation:<br>
Collagen sponges 1x1x1 cm in size (Gelfoam®; Peasel &amp; Lorey, order no. 407534; K.T.<br>
Chong et al., Abstracts of 39th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and<br>
Chemotherapy, 1999, p. 439) are initially wetted with phosphate-buffered saline<br>
(PBS), the trapped air bubbles are removed by degassing, and then stored in MEM,<br>
10% FCS (v/v), 1% glutamine (v/v), 1% Pen/Strep (v/v). 1 x 106 virus-infected NHDF<br>
cells (infection with HCMV Davis or HCMV AD169 M.O.I = 0.03) are detached<br><br>
3 hours after infection and added dropwise in 20 µl of MEM, 10% PCS (v/v), 1%<br>
glutamine (v/v), 1% Pen/Strep (v/v) to a moist sponge. The sponges are incubated for<br>
3-4 hours to allow the cells to adhere. Then, following the addition of medium<br>
(MEM, 10% FCS) (v/v), 1% glutamine (v/v), 1% Pen/Strep (v/v)) , the sponges are<br>
incubated overnight. For the transplantation, the immunodeficient mice are anaes-<br>
thetized with Avertin or a ketamine/xylazine/azepromazine mixture, the fur on the<br>
back is removed using a shaver, the eµldermis is opened 1-2 cm, unstressed and the<br>
moist sponges are transplanted under the dorsal skin. The surgical wound is closed<br>
with tissue glue or clips. 4-6 hours after the transplantation, the mice can be treated<br>
for the first time (one treatment is given on the day of the operation). On subsequent<br>
days, oral treatment with the substance is carried out three times a day (7.00 h and<br>
14.00 h and 19.00 h), twice a day (8 h and 18 h) or once a day (9 h) over a period of<br>
8 days. The daily dose is for example 1 or 3 or 10 or 30 or 100 mg/kg of body weight,<br>
the volume administered is 10 ml/kg of body weight. The substances are formulated<br>
in the form of a 0.5% Tylose suspension/PBS with 2% DMSO or another suitable<br>
mixture aiding solubility of the substances, e.g. 2% ethanol, 2.5% Solutol, 95.5% PBS.<br>
10 days after transplantation and about 16 hours after the last administration of<br>
substance, the animals are painlessly sacrificed and the sponge is removed. The virus-<br>
infected cells are released from the sponge by collagenase digestion (330 U/1.5 ml)<br>
and stored in the presence of MEM, 10% FCS (v/v), 1% glutamine (v/v), 1% Pen/Strep<br>
(v/v), 10% DMSO at -140°C. Evaluation takes place after serial ten-fold dilutions of<br>
the virus-infected cells by determining the titer on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF<br>
cells after fixing and staining with a Giemsa formaldehyde solution. The number of<br>
infected cells or infectious virus particles (infectious centre assay) after the substance<br>
treatment compared with the placebo-treated control group is determined. Statistical<br>
evaluation takes place by suitable computer programs, such as GraphPad Prism.<br><br>
