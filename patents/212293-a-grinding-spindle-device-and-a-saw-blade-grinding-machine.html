				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Grinding spindle and saw blade grinding machine with high<br>
frequency spindle.<br>
The invention refers to a grinding spindle and saw blade<br>
grinding machine, particularly for saw blades, whose saw<br>
teeth display a concave face.<br>
Saw blade grinding machine, which are used in the<br>
maintenance for sharpening of already used saw blades or in<br>
production must match in each case with the conditions<br>
prevailing at the saw blade or with the shape of tooth to<br>
be produced. As per rule, at a tooth of a saw blade<br>
particularly in carbide tipped saw blades, back of tooth<br>
and tooth face are to be ground. Some times tooth flanks<br>
are also ground. Ground shapes differ therein. In some<br>
cases it can be as for example desirable to grind the tooth<br>
face concave, while in other cases a flat grinding is<br>
desired.<br>
For generation of a concave grinding at a tooth face a<br>
concave face grinding process is known from the DE 4141900<br>
A1 which works with a cylindrical grinding body, whose axis<br>
of rotation is oriented mainly parallel to the tooth face<br>
surface area. The grinding body is part of a mounted<br>
grinding point which is brought into engagement in the<br>
centre level or in two positions of engagement with the<br>
tooth face shifted against the centre level of saw blade,<br>
in order to grind them. Depending on the direction of off-<br>
set it"s direction of rotation is selected.<br>
The concave grinding of tooth face is required only in a<br>
few cases of saw blades, but not in all types. The saw<br>
blade grinding machine will however be input as per rule<br>
flexible without resetting or rather rechanging.<br>
Starting from there, it is the assignment of the invention,<br>
to achieve an improvement in the saw blade grinding<br>
machine, through which many different types of saw blades<br>
to the. extent possible may be processed.<br>
This assignment is solved with the grinding spindle as per<br>
claim 1 as well as with the saw blade grinding machine as<br>
per claim 12.<br>
The grinding spindle as per invention shows two shafts,<br>
which are combined with drives for different number of<br>
rotations. While the first shaft can be provided at their<br>
both ends in each case with at least one grinding wheel, at<br>
the second shaft arranged between the ends of first shaft a<br>
mounted grinding point can be assembled. Preferably the<br>
drives of both the shafts are so designed that the number<br>
of rotation of first shaft proportions to the number of<br>
rotation of second shaft as the circumference of grinding<br>
tool of second shaft to the circumference of (larger)<br>
grinding wheel of first shaft. The mounted grinding point<br>
runs as for example with a number of rotation of 10,000 to<br>
60,000 rotations/ min.<br>
Through the assembly of second shaft in an area between the<br>
ends of first shaft, that means preferably outside of a<br>
cylindrical or cone shaped area, enclosed between the<br>
grinding wheels, a compact, stable, with less vibration and<br>
even yet permitting a well positioned structure is<br>
attained. The high sped grinding tool (mounted grinding<br>
point) can be brought without problem into engagement with the<br>
tooth face of all most each saw blade. The distance of<br>
grinding body of mounted grinding point from the first axis<br>
of rotation is preferably at least so large as the radius<br>
of larger grinding wheel, in doing so the axes of rotation<br>
can cut or cross over. Through it, it is prevented that the<br>
grinding wheels come into engagement with saw blades when<br>
the mounted grinding point will be active. In case the<br>
grinding wheels work, the mounted grinding point is<br>
removed from the saw blade. The positioning way of grinding<br>
spindle are short in this structure and a quick rational<br>
work is made possible.<br>
It results a specially compact, rigid structure, when the<br>
shafts provided at the grinding head are held to each other<br>
in firm spatial arrangement. The shafts provided in the<br>
grinding spindle are laid thereby in the support carrier<br>
preferably not adjustable to each other.<br>
Preferably the drives of both the shafts are separated and<br>
consequently are controllable independent to each other. To<br>
the drive equipment for the first shaft and the second<br>
shaft belong then a first and second drive over which the<br>
shafts in each case are driven separately. The second drive<br>
is preferably a high speed drive with a number of rotations<br>
(as for example 60,000 rotations / minute fixed, which is<br>
at least ten times greater than the number of rotations of<br>
first shaft (as for example 1000-6000 rotations/ minute).<br>
This makes possible the input of grinding tools to one and<br>
the same grinding spindle tools to one and the same<br>
grinding spindle, whose diameter vary very strongly as for<br>
example around more than one order of magnitude.<br>
For the positioning it is advantageous, when the first<br>
shaft and the second shaft are oriented to each in right<br>
angle, cutting each other or off-set to each other. Therein<br>
lie both shafts preferably in each case in one plane, which<br>
agrees with the saw blade centre level or with one level<br>
parallel to this.<br>
The saw blade grinding machine shows as per claim 12 and 13<br>
a machine rack, on which all essential components of saw<br>
blade grinding machine are supported. The machine rack<br>
holds one saw blade carrier which if required in<br>
combination with a clamping device is equipped to it to<br>
store the saw blade stationary for processing in a<br>
processing position. Besides a device is provided to move<br>
further the saw blade toothwise and with it to transport<br>
the teeth one after the other in processing position. For<br>
this a separate feed device, a so called parting finger can<br>
be provided. Alternatively, the feed device can also be<br>
part of saw blade carrier. It can apply at the teeth of saw<br>
blade as also at other locations of saw blade or at the saw<br>
blade carrier.<br>
Preferably a feed device is used, which can be controllable<br>
in variable condition, so that as per requirement feed<br>
steps can be adjusted. In a specially preferred design<br>
shape, the feed steps are individually controlled, in order<br>
to adjust also to one and the same saw blade changing feed<br>
steps.<br>
For processing of teeth at least one grinding spindle as<br>
per invention serves, which shows a support carrier. This<br>
can be sub-divided as per requirement (first and second<br>
support carrier). The shafts are in each case provided with<br>
at least one own grinding body. While one shaft is equipped<br>
with one or more number of grinding wheels, the other<br>
carries a mounted grinding tool. The first and the second<br>
shaft are driven by a drive device, in doing so the drive<br>
device preferably is distributed in two separate drives,<br>
which are separately controllable. This preferably from a<br>
master control device, which also takes over the other<br>
control of grinding machine.<br>
The grinding spindle is built such, that preferably at one<br>
point of time purely only one of the grinding bodies comes<br>
in engagement with the saw blade. Correspondingly drive of<br>
one shaft in each case is sufficient. The mounted grinding<br>
tool is provided for processing of tooth face. The grinding<br>
wheel(s) is (are) in first instance provided for processing<br>
of back of teeth as also as per requirement of tooth face.<br>
The high speed drive for the mounted grinding point can be<br>
designed as retrofit kit provided for construction at<br>
existing or correspondingly prefitted grinding spindles.<br>
A positioning device carried from the machine rack, permits<br>
at least two linear adjust directions and optionally one<br>
swivelling movement around a swivelling axis B standing<br>
vertically on the saw blade and should the occasion arise<br>
around a further swivelling axis. Through the swivelling a<br>
matching of orientation of grinding wheel and of the<br>
mounted grinding point to the back of the teeth and to the<br>
tooth face is made possible. Additionally linear axes<br>
permit a feed movement. In ideal case three linear axes in<br>
each case in right angle to one another are provided.<br>
An essential advantage of new grinding machine lies<br>
therein, that also saw blades, whose teeth show a concave<br>
face can be fully ground in one operation in one set up<br>
with a machine. Manual operation is as a rule not required<br>
and the positioning ways are short.<br>
The positioning device is carried from the machine rack, to<br>
make possible a precise allocation and positioning in<br>
relation to the saw blade. In place of swivelling axis B the<br>
saw blade can also be dealt with an other position, in<br>
doing so the grinding spindle remains unswivelled. This can<br>
take place through an adjustment of saw blade carrier on an<br>
arch shaped or straight track sidewise to a combination<br>
between the saw blade carrier and the grinding spindle.<br>
Besides the axis of rotation of saw blade in combination<br>
with the sidewise adjustment of grinding spindle can<br>
replace the B-axis.<br>
A control device controls the work of saw blade grinding<br>
machine and controls the positioning device as well as the<br>
feed device as also the holding device and the drive<br>
device. Consequently the total grinding process can run<br>
controlled. The preferable flexible control device as well<br>
as the above mentioned assembly of other components permits<br>
the complete processing of saw blade in one set up in one<br>
and the same saw blade grinding machine. The saw blade<br>
grinding machine is useful over this flexibly and in<br>
versatile ways.<br>
For matching to varying saw blade diameter, the saw blade<br>
carrier is laid preferably adjustable in the machine rack<br>
in order to adjust the distance to the grinding spindle.<br>
Alternatively the matching of position of grinding spindle<br>
to variable saw blade diameter can be taken up through an<br>
an adjustment of grinding spindle. Altogether, with it<br>
three linear axes are sufficient for position adjustment.<br>
Besides at least one swivelling axis for the grinding<br>
spindle is present. In case the saw blade carrier is laid<br>
at the machine rack not stationary, but adjustable, it<br>
displays preferably an adjustment drive, which is<br>
controlled like all other drives likewise by the control<br>
device. This makes possible a flexible processing of lots<br>
composed out of varying saw blades.<br>
In front of grinding spindle preferably a clamping device<br>
is provided as holding device for support of saw blades<br>
which is firmly supported on the machine rack. The clamping<br>
device takes hold of the saw blade in the proximity of<br>
teeth under process and is preferably controllable by the<br>
control device.<br>
The grinding wheel existing on the first shaft is at least<br>
provided at it"s circumferential face with abrasive<br>
material. Additionally it can be coated at one of it"s flat<br>
sides or at both the flat sides with abrasive grains in<br>
order to process different areas of saw tooth.<br>
The mounted grinding point running with higher and highest<br>
number of rotations shows preferably a cylinder or cone<br>
shaped grinding body, in doing so it"s radius at an useful<br>
execution shape is greater than the thickness of a tooth of<br>
saw blade measured in direction of axis. In order to<br>
generate a specially deep rounded fillet at the tooth face,<br>
the diameter can be smaller than the tooth thickness.<br>
Further details of advantageous execution shape of<br>
invention are items of subordinate claims, of drawing or of<br>
description. In the drawing an execution example of<br>
invention has been shown. They show :<br>

schematic side view.<br>
In Figure 1 a grinding machine is shown which serves as saw<br>
blade grinding machine. The grinding machine 1 shows a<br>
machine rack 2 which is installed stationary on a not<br>
further shown mounted face. The grinding machine 1 serves<br>
for grinding of saw blades, particularly circular saw<br>
blades 3, as it is shown in Figure 3 purely schematically.<br>
For storing of saw blade 3 a saw blade carrier 4 serves,<br>
which is located rotatable around an axis of rotation 5.<br>
The saw blade carrier 4 shows for pick up and orientation<br>
of saw blade 3 an arbour 6 which looms up from a plane<br>
seating surface 7 of saw blade carrier 4 and centres the<br>
saw blade 3.<br>
For fastening of saw blade 3 at the saw blade carrier 4 a<br>
clamping 8 serves, which consequently if required in joint<br>
operation with further not shown clamping device serves as<br>
fastening means.<br>
The saw blade carrier 4 is carried from a positioning<br>
device 9 which positions the saw blade carrier around the<br>
axis of rotation 5 rotatable and additionally displaceable<br>
along a direction denoted through an arrow 10. The drive<br>
for carrying out displacement movement is not shown further<br>
in Figure 2. It is under the control device" 11, with an<br>
indicator device 12 and input item 14.<br>
The control device 11 controls besides a feed device 15<br>
which is located on the machine rack 2. It serves to<br>
stepwise rotation of the saw blade 3 in order to transport<br>
in each case a tooth 3a (Figure 3) of the same in<br>
processing position. The feed device 15 shows a moveable<br>
finger 18 in at least one, preferably two directions 16, 17<br>
which can rotate the saw blade 3 toothwise around it"s axis<br>
of rotation 5. The finger 18 is besides positioned around a<br>
swivelling axis 5 capable of swivelling, in order to slide<br>
over the teeth 3a like a retaining pawl. A (from the<br>
control device 11) controlled drive or a spring engage the<br>
finger 18 in the teeth intermediate space.<br>
Besides one holding device 19 controlled likewise from the<br>
control device 11 is provided which serves to it to store<br>
the saw blade 3 in static condition for processing of it"s<br>
respective tooth and which is carried by machine rack 2. A<br>
stationary lower jaw 21 and one moveable upper jaw 23 in<br>
direction of an arrow 22 to some extent parallel to the<br>
axis of rotation 5 belong to the holding device 19. The<br>
jaws 21, 22 can also as per requirement be replaced through<br>
a single jaw by a controllable magnet or equivalent.<br>
For carrying out of a grinding process of saw blades a<br>
grinding spindle 24 serves which is carried by a<br>
positioning device 25 and is supported at the machine<br>
rack 2. The grinding spindle 24 shows, as evident from<br>
Figure 3, two grinding wheels 26a, 26b and a mounted<br>
grinding point 27.<br>
The grinding wheels 26a, 26b are, as evident from Figure 4<br>
and 5 are provided for grinding process of a back of tooth<br>
28 and of a flat (plane) tooth face of a tooth 29 of saw<br>
blade 3, while the mounted grinding point 27 as per Figure<br>
6 serves for processing of a tooth face 21. The grinding<br>
wheels 26a, 26b are carried by a shaft 33, which are stored<br>
rotatable at a position carrier 34 around on axis of<br>
rotation 35 or is alternatively fixed and at whose ends<br>
they are fastened. The position carrier 34 is combined<br>
with a base plate 36, which is carried by the position<br>
device 25. In an execution shape the base plate is<br>
swingable around an axis 0 (Figure 1), which shows somewhat<br>
parallel to the saw blade 3 towards it"s centre and which<br>
is consequently some what parallel to the direction denoted<br>
through the arrow 10.<br>
At the position carrier 34 a carrier 37 (Figure 3) is<br>
fastened, which shows a spindle or shaft 38. This is<br>
located rotatable around an axis of rotation 39 and<br>
carries at one end the mounted grinding point 27. The axes<br>
of rotation 35, 39 are preferably oriented at perpendicular<br>
to each other and are arranged in parallel to each other<br>
levels Al, A2 (Figure 1) parallel to the saw blade 3. As<br>
per requirement, the base plate 36, as indicated in the<br>
Figures 3 and 4 to 6 through an axis 41, can be stored<br>
swingable (arrow 42 in Figure 2). With it, the axis of<br>
rotation 35 can tilt against : the saw blade level, which<br>
however is not required in each case. The levels Al and A2<br>
have a distance from each other which corresponds<br>
approximately to sum out of grinding wheel radius the<br>
mounted grinding point radius and the thickness of saw<br>
blade. Besides the mounted grinding point 27, as it is<br>
indicated in Figure 7 through a dashed line A3 is arranged<br>
below the plane grinding surface of grinding wheel 26b (in<br>
relation to Y-direction).<br>
The carrier 37 forns with a spindle motor 43 (high frequency<br>
spindle) and with the mounted grinding point 27 a grinding<br>
module 44, which is preferably firmly installed. In the<br>
grinding module 44, cooling channels are provided for<br>
cooling of spindle motor 43 developed as high capacity<br>
drive. Besides channels supply as per requirement a cooling<br>
lubricating fluid to the mounted grinding point 27.<br>
The drive of first shaft 33 takes place over a drive<br>
equipment, to which a motor 33a held by the position<br>
carrier 33 and a gear 33b (toothed belt) belong. The drive<br>
of shaft 33 as well as the drive of shaft 38 exists under<br>
preferably the control device 11. With it both shafts 33,<br>
38 can be driven as per requirement and independent from<br>
each other.<br>
The positioning device 25 shows a carrier 51 which is<br>
located capable of swivelling in an execution form around a<br>
swivelling axis B oriented parallel to the axis of rotation<br>
5. A corresponding^ not shown further, swivelling drive for<br>
fixing selected swivelling position exists below the<br>
control of control device 11. The carrier 51 is provided<br>
with a linear guide, which guides a sliding frame 52 in a<br>
Z-direction (Fig.2) away from the swivelling axis B and on<br>
this to or in X-direction (Figure 1) adjustable linear. A<br>
corresponding Z-drive 53 (X-drive) is likewise carried by<br>
the carrier 51.<br>
On the sliding frame 52 a further carrier 54 displaceable<br>
in X-direction (Z-direction in Figure 1) is stored which is<br>
adjustable consequently approximately in direction of<br>
circumference in relation to saw blade 3 (depending on<br>
swivelling position of carrier 51). A corresponding<br>
adjustment drive is not shown further and exists under the<br>
control 11.<br>
At the carrier 54, vertically in Y-direction adjustable a<br>
sliding frame 55 is stored, which carries the base plate<br>
36. The sliding frame 55 is positioned by an adjustment<br>
drive 55a which is controlled by the control device 11. The<br>
so far described grinding machine 1 works as it follows :<br>
For processing of saw blade 3 at it"s tooth face area 31,<br>
this is arranged on the saw blade carrier 4 and is firmly<br>
clamped with the fastening medium 8.<br>
The feed device 15 positions the saw blade 3 now in a<br>
desired first grinding position, as it is as for example<br>
shown in Figure 6. With the holding device 19, the saw<br>
blade 3 now is firmly clamped in this position and grinding<br>
spindle 24 (particularly in Y-direction) is so positioned<br>
that the mounted grinding point 27, as shown in Figure 3<br>
remains before the tooth 29. The axis of rotation 39 is<br>
oriented parallel to the tooth face area. The drive 43 is<br>
controlled by the controlled device 11 such that the<br>
mounted grinding point 27 runs with higher number of<br>
rotations. The grinding wheel can remain therein in static<br>
condition.<br>
After the axis of rotation 39 preferably is oriented mainly<br>
parallel to the Z-axis, the drive 53 is activated, so that<br>
the grinding spindle 24 performs a movement in Z-direction<br>
and with it longitudinally of axis of rotation 39 of<br>
mounted grinding point 27. This can take piace in saw blade<br>
centre. As per requirement through adjustment of Y-axis<br>
also a displacement of saw blade centre level can be<br>
reached. The grinding process of tooth face area 31 can as<br>
per requirement be repeated in different Y-positioning, in<br>
order to generate a cutting face area shape which deviates<br>
from the shape of case face of mounted grinding point 27.<br>
Additionally or in place of operation of Y-axis, the Y-axis<br>
can also be operated to adjust the mounted grinding point<br>
27 vertical. Besides a movement in X-direction can take<br>
place, which agrees mainly with the direction of<br>
circumference of saw blade.<br>
Due to high displacement (in Y-direction) between the<br>
mounted grinding point 27 and grinding wheels 26a, 26b<br>
around preferably at least one grinding wheel radius the<br>
grinding wheel 26b stands above saw blade, so that the<br>
grinding spindle 24 can be moved and positioned<br>
unrestricted without that the grinding wheels 26a, 26b come<br>
in engagement undesired with the saw blade 3.<br>
After the grinding of tooth 27, at it"s tooth face the<br>
grinding spindle 24 is driven in Z-direction somewhat to<br>
outside and the holding device 19 is opened. With the feed<br>
device 15, the saw blade 3 is further connected around a<br>
tooth and thereafter is again firmly clamped through the<br>
holding device, after which the next tooth face 31 can be<br>
processed.<br>
When all tooth face areas of all teeth of saw blade 3 are<br>
processed, without compulsorily, changing of saw blade 3,<br>
the back face of tooth 28 can be processed. For this the<br>
grinding spindle 24 is transported in the position shown in<br>
Figure 4 and drops in Y-direction. The axis of rotation 35<br>
is essentially oriented parallel to the back of tooth 28<br>
under grinding in each case. An activation in direction of<br>
X-axis, that means parallel to the axis of rotation 35<br>
(which is preferably oriented parallel to the X-qxis) leads,<br>
now to grinding of back of tooth 28. In case these are to<br>
be built plane, additionally a movement in Y-direction can<br>
be executed. As for example, this can take place when the<br>
total back of tooth 28 stands in engagement with the face<br>
of circumference of grinding wheel 26a.<br>
In case a back of tooth 28 is ground, the control device 11<br>
activates the clamping device 19 and the feed device 15, in<br>
order to bring the next tooth in processing position and<br>
again to clamp it firmly there. In this way all back of<br>
tooth are processed one after the other.<br>
Additionally or alternatively to concave grinding of tooth<br>
face as per Fig. 6, the tooth face can also be ground<br>
plane. The plane grinding can limit on the external area of<br>
tooth face or can cover it fully. The grinding process is<br>
shown in Figure 5. In case such a plane grinding is not<br>
required, the grinding wheel 26b can also be eliminated.<br>
Alternatively in place of grinding wheel 26b also the<br>
grinding wheel 26a is eliminated, when back of tooth<br>
grinding is not required.<br>
The grinding spindle shows with it two working levels Al,<br>
A2 (Fig.7) which are displaced perpendicular to the saw<br>
blade 3 agqinst each other (Y-direction). The displacement<br>
is preferably somewhat greater than a radius of grinding<br>
wheels 26a, 26b. The working levels Al is assigned to the<br>
grinding wheels 26a, 26b while the other working level A2<br>
is assigned to the mounted grinding point 27. Preferably<br>
the distance or displacement between the working levels is<br>
equal to sum out of (largest to be taken) radius of<br>
grinding wheels 26a, 26b and the (largest to be taken)<br>
diameter of mounted grinding point. In any case, however<br>
the distance is so sized that the grinding wheels 26a, 26b<br>
stand at a sufficient safety distance over the saw blade 3,<br>
when the mounted grinding point 27 remains in engagement<br>
with tooth face in it"s deepest position. The distance<br>
between the working levels Al, A2 is particularly shown in<br>
Fig. 7.<br>
In case without or with less vertical positioning movement<br>
it should be managed, the axes 33, 38 can also be arranged<br>
in less distance from each other. The grinding body of<br>
mounted grinding point 27 is however in any case arranged<br>
outside of a volume or area, which is limited between the<br>
grinding wheels by the saw blade with the largest<br>
admissible diameter, when it is approached in the working<br>
level of mounted grinding point at the grinding wheels and<br>
does not touch it as yet. Thus the mounted grinding 27 can<br>
be brought in engagement with the saw blade, without that<br>
the saw blade comes in engagement with the grinding wheels<br>
and even then a compact (rigid) structure is reached which<br>
permits short actuator travels.<br>
The saw blade 3 is ground at all tooth face areas and back<br>
of tooth in one set up. Once it is finish ground, it is<br>
taken out and is replaced through the next following saw<br>
blade to be processed. In case it"s diameter deviates from<br>
the diameter of the previously processed saw blade 3, the<br>
positioning device 9 for the saw blade carrier 4 in<br>
direction of arrow 10 is so adjusted that the teeth located<br>
in processing position in each case again remain in area of<br>
holding device 19 and of grinding spindle 24.<br>
A grinding machine 1, which mainly serves for sharpening of<br>
saw blade 3, shows a machine frame 2 which carries a device<br>
for storing of saw blades, for stationary static firm<br>
clamping of same and for tooth wise further connection.<br>
Besides the machine rack 2 carries a positioning device,<br>
which guides a grinding spindle. The grinding spindle 24<br>
shows two spindles independent from each other, mainly<br>
oriented at right angle to each other, which preferably<br>
carry separate drives and are oriented at right angle to<br>
each other. The grinding spindle 24 is swingable as well as<br>
is positioned in three spatial directions adjustably.<br>
In a selected swivelling position one of these<br>
spatial directions (Z-directions) is oriented radially to<br>
the saw blade 3. In this position the axis of rotation 35<br>
of a spindle is oriented in direction of circumference and<br>
the axis of rotation 39 of other spindle is oriented in<br>
radial direction. Such a grinding spindle permits the<br>
concave grinding of tooth face areas with mounted grinding<br>
points of less diameter. For drive a separate high speed<br>
motor serves.<br>
