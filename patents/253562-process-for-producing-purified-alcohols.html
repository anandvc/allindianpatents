				<td>Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing an alcohol by subjecting an aldehyde to condensation and dehydration reactions to produce a condensate thereof" and hydrogenating the condensate. More particularly, the invention relates to a process in which normal butyraldehyde (NBD) is subjected to condensation and dehydration reactions to produce 2-ethylhexenal (EPA) and this compound is hydrogenated to thereby produce 2-ethylhexanol (2EH). Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
The production of 2-ethylhexanol (2EH) from normal butyraldehyde (NBD) is being industrially conducted on a large scale. This process is: constituted of an NBD condensation step in which two molecules of NBD undergo aldol condensation and dehydration to give 2-ethylhexenal<br>
(ethylpropylacrolein, EPA) , an 1SPA hydrogenation step in which the EPA obtained is reacted with hydrogen to obtain crude 2EH, and a 2EH purification step in which the crude 2EH is purified to a desired purity to obtain a 2EH product.<br>
The purification of crude 2EH is conducted mainly by distillation.<br>
[0003]<br>
Although it is a matter of course that alcohols<br>
including 2EH as industrial products which are dealt in on<br>
the market should have a high purity, these alcohols are<br>
also required to be reduced in coloring in a sulfuric acid<br>
coloring test.<br>
[0004]<br>
Substances which have been conventionally known to<br>
cause 2EH to give unfavorable results in a sulfuric acid<br>
coloring test are aldehydes such as 2-ethylhexanal (2HA)<br>
and unsaturated alcohols such as 2-ethylhexenol. For<br>
example, patent document 1 discloses a process for<br>
producing a saturated alcohol by reacting the corresponding<br>
aldehyde in a vapor phase with hydrogen, wherein a product<br>
of the reduction of a catalyst precursor composition<br>
containing an ingredient represented by the following<br>
general formula (i) is used as a hydrogenation catalyst to<br>
thereby diminish unsaturated alcohols in 2EH.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Formula-1]<br>
Cu (a) -Cr (b) -Zn (c) -Mn (d) -Ba (e) -X (f) (i)<br>
[0006]<br>
(In the formula, X represents a transition metal in Group <br>
or Group 4A of the periodic table, and a to f, which<br>
represent, the contents of the respective components in<br>
terms of oxide amount, are as follows: a indicates 20-50%<br>
by weight, b 0-50% by weight, c 0-50% by weight, d 0.1-5.0%<br>
by weight, e 0.1-5.0% by weight, and f 0.01-3.0% by<br>
weight.)<br>
However, there are cases where even 2EH from which<br>
aldehydes and unsaturated alcohols have been removed gives<br>
poor results in a sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem that the Invention is to Solve<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to<br>
provide a process for producing a purified alcohol (in<br>
particular, 2EH) which gives satisfactory results in a<br>
sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0008]<br>
Investigations made by the present inventors<br>
revealed that when compounds having a heterocycle having a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond therein, such as a pyran ring or<br>
dihydropyran ring, are present in an alcohol, this alcohol<br>
gives unfavorable results in a sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
Although these compounds can be separated in some degree<br>
from the alcohol by distillation, the separation thereof by<br>
ordinary distillation is extremely difficult. It is<br>
important to reduce beforehand the amount of those<br>
compounds present in the crude alcohol to be subjected to a<br>
purification treatment. For obtaining an alcohol product<br>
giving satisfactory results in a sulfuric acid coloring<br>
test, it is desirable to reduce beforehand the<br>
concentration of those compounds in the crude alcohol to<br>
200 weight ppm or lower, especially 100 weight ppm or lower.<br>
As a result of investigations made by the inventors, one<br>
method effective in reducing the amount of those compounds<br>
present in a crude alcohol was found to comprise distilling<br>
a reaction product obtained by the condensation and<br>
dehydration of an aldehyde to obtain the condensate as a<br>
distillate and thereby separate high-boiling compounds and<br>
feeding the condensate to a hydrogenation step.<br>
Furthermore, the amount of those compounds in a crude<br>
alcohol can be reduced also by hydrogenating the condensate<br>
in two stages by conducting catalytic hydrogenation and<br>
catalytic hydrogenation in which a catalyst different from<br>
that in the former hydrogenation is used.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention has been achieved based on such<br>
findings. Essential points of the invention reside in the<br>
following (1) to (8) .<br>

purification step.<br>

Advantage of the Invention<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the invention, a purified alcohol<br>
giving satisfactory results in a sulfuric acid coloring<br>
test can be produced.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
[0015]<br>
[Fig. 1] Fig. 1 is a presentation showing the results of<br>
Example 2.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0016]<br>
In the invention, an aldehyde is first subjected to<br>
aldol condensation and dehydration reactions to obtain a<br>
condensate. The aldehyde is not particularly limited, and<br>
use may be made of a saturated aldehyde having at least 3<br>
carbon atoms, generally 3-10 carbon atoms. Examples of the<br>
saturated aldehyde include linear and branched aldehydes.<br>
Specific examples thereof include propionaldehyde,<br>
butyraldehyde, valer aldehyde, heptylaldehyde, and nonyl<br>
aldehyde. Preferred are butyraldehyde and valeraldehyde.<br>
Especially preferred is normal butyraldehyde. Examples of<br>
the condensate include the condensates corresponding to the<br>
aldehydes shown above. Specific examples thereof include<br>
2-methylpentenal, 2-ethylhexenal, and 2-propylheptenal.<br>
Preferred are 2-ethylhexenal and 2-propylheptenal.<br>
Especially preferred is 2-ethylhexenal<br>
(ethylpropylacrolein). This condensation reaction and<br>
dehydration can be conducted by a known method. In general,<br>
the condensation and dehydration are conducted by reacting<br>
the aldehyde generally at 80-100°C using an aqueous alkali<br>
solution, e.g., a 1-5 wt% aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide, as a catalyst.<br>
[0017]<br>
The liquid reaction mixture is separated into an<br>
aqueous phase comprising the aqueous alkali solution and an<br>
oil phase comprising the condensate. The aqueous phase is<br>
circulated and used as a catalyst.<br>
Investigations made by the inventors<br>
revealed that the condensate obtained in the<br>
condensation step contains a compound having<br>
a carbon-carbon double bond. Specifically, in<br>
the case where the starting aldehyde is normal<br>
butyraldehyde, the 2-ethylhexanal obtained in the<br>
condensation step contains the aldehyde compound of the<br>
following formula (I) which is thought to have been<br>
generated by the condensation of three NBD molecules.<br>
[0018]<br>
[Formula-2]<br>
(D<br>
[0019]<br>
It is presumed that in the subsequent hydrogenation<br>
step, this compound is converted to the compound (II)<br>
having a pyran ring and part of the compound (II) is<br>
hydrogenated to the compound (III) having a dihydropyran<br>
ring. Even when contained in an extremely slight amount,<br>
these compounds cause the alcohol to give considerably<br>
unfavorable results in a sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
[0020]<br>
[Formula-3]<br>
 [0021]<br>
[Formula-4]<br>
 [0022]<br>
The compounds having an oxygen-containing<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring<br>
(the compounds (II) and (III)) can be converted by<br>
hydrogenation to the corresponding compound having a<br>
tetrahydropyran ring. This compound yielded, which has a<br>
tetrahydropyran ring, does not cause the alcohol to give<br>
unfavorable results in a sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
However, under ordinary conditions for the hydrogenation of<br>
the condensate (2-ethylhexenal), it is difficult to<br>
completely hydrogenate the compounds having an oxygencontaining<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond<br>
in the ring (compounds (II) and (III)) to the compound<br>
having a tetrahydropyran ring. Consequently, when the<br>
condensate (2-ethylhexenal) which has been obtained by the<br>
condensation reaction and dehydration of NBD and contains a<br>
high-boiling compound (the compound (I)) is hydrogenated<br>
without any treatment, then the crude alcohol yielded (2EH)<br>
contains the compounds (the compounds (II) and (III))<br>
having an oxygen-containing heterocycle having a carboncarbon<br>
double bond in the ring, which remains without being<br>
hydrogenated to a tetrahydropyran ring. Since these<br>
compounds are difficult to be separated from the alcohol<br>
(2EH) by ordinary distillation, they come into the product<br>
alcohol (2EH) to cause it to give unfavorable results in a<br>
sulfuric acid coloring test. It is therefore desirable<br>
that the total concentration of compounds having an oxygencontaining<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond<br>
in the ring (compounds having a pyran ring or dihydropyran<br>
ring) in the alcohol (2EH) to be subjected to the<br>
purification step be reduced beforehand to 200 weight ppm<br>
or lower, preferably 100 weight ppm or lower, especially<br>
preferably 50 weight ppm or lower.<br>
[0023]<br>
Examples of methods for reducing the concentration<br>
of compounds having an oxygen-containing heterocycle having<br>
a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (compounds having a<br>
pyran ring or dihydropyran ring) in the crude alcohol<br>
include distillation techniques such as rectification and<br>
flash distillation. Specific examples thereof include a<br>
method in which the condensate obtained in the aldehyde<br>
condensation step is distilled to separate the high-boiling<br>
compounds generated by the condensation (the compound (I))<br>
from the condensate together with other high-boiling<br>
compounds and the condensate reduced in high-boilingcompound<br>
concentration is subjected to the subsequent<br>
hydrogenation step. The distillation can be conducted, for<br>
example, with a distillation column having about 5-20<br>
plates under the conditions of a column top temperature of<br>
80-200 °C and a column top pressure of from 90 iranHg to<br>
atmospheric pressure. This operation may be conducted at a<br>
reflux ratio of 0.2-10, preferably 0.2-5, or while purging<br>
3-10% of the feed amount through the bottom of the<br>
distillation column, whereby the degree of removal of highboiling<br>
compounds from the condensate obtained in the<br>
condensation step can be heightened to 98% or above. In<br>
case where a condensate containing high-boiling compounds<br>
is fed to a hydrogenation step, there is a possibility that<br>
the high-boiling compounds might yield compounds having an<br>
oxygen-containing heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double<br>
bond in the ring (the compounds (II) and (III)) during the<br>
step. However, when the condensate in which the<br>
concentration of high-boiling compounds has been reduced is<br>
subjected to hydrogenation, then the generation of<br>
compounds having an oxygen-containing heterocycle having a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (the compounds (II)<br>
and (III)) in the hydrogenation step can be avoided.<br>
[0024]<br>
The hydrogenation reaction of the condensate<br>
reduced in high-boiling-compound concentration can be<br>
conducted in either a vapor phase or a liquid phase. As a<br>
catalyst may be used one obtained by depositing an active<br>
ingredient such as nickel, chromium, copper, or palladium<br>
on a support such as diatomaceous earth, zeolite, alumina,<br>
or active carbon. It is especially preferred to use one<br>
obtained by depositing nickel and chromium on diatomaceous<br>
earth or one obtained by reducing an oxide of chromium,<br>
copper, zinc, manganese, barium, etc. The reaction<br>
temperature and pressure may be selected in the ranges of<br>
40-200°C and of from atmospheric pressure to about 15.0 MPa<br>
according to the catalyst and reaction mode to be used.<br>
[0025]<br>
Another method for reducing the concentration of<br>
compounds having an oxygen-containing heterocycle having a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (compounds having a<br>
pyran ring or dihydropyran ring) in the crude alcohol is to<br>
hydrogenate the high-boiling compounds generated by the<br>
condensation (the compound (I)) and the compounds having an<br>
oxygen-containing heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double<br>
bond in the ring (the compounds (II) and (III)) to the<br>
corresponding compounds having a tetrahydropyran ring when<br>
the condensate (2-ethylhexenal) is hydrogenated. However,<br>
it is difficult with one kind of catalyst to simultaneously<br>
and efficiently conduct the hydrogenation of the condensate<br>
(2-ethylhexenal) to an alcohol (2EH) and the hydrogenation<br>
of the high-boiling compounds generated by the condensation<br>
(the compound (I)) and the compounds having an oxygencontaining<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond<br>
in the ring (the compounds (II) and (III)) to the<br>
corresponding compounds having a tetrahydropyran ring.<br>
Consequently, in order that the high-boiling compounds<br>
generated by the condensation (the compound (I)) and the<br>
compounds having an oxygen-containing heterocycle having a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (the compounds (II)<br>
and (III)) might be hydrogenated to the corresponding<br>
compounds having a tetrahydropyran ring in the step of<br>
hydrogenating the condensate (2-ethylhexenal) , reaction<br>
conditions including the catalyst, temperature, and<br>
pressure may be regulated so as to be suitable for each<br>
of the hydrogenation of the condensate (2-ethylhexenal)<br>
and the hydrogenation of the compounds having a pyran<br>
ring or dihydropyran ring to the corresponding compounds<br>
having a tetrahydropyran ring.<br>
Examples of such reaction condi tions include: a method<br>
in which a first-stage hydrogenation reaction is<br>
conducted at 100-200°C and a pressure of from<br>
atmospheric pressure to 15.0 MPa using a Cu-Cr catalyst<br>
and a second stage hydrogenation reaction is<br>
subsequently conducted at 50-150°C and 2.0-5.0 MFa using<br>
a nickel catalyst; and a method in which a first-stage<br>
hydrogenation reaction is conducted at 100-200°C and a<br>
pressure of from atmospheric pressure to 15.0 MPa using<br>
an Ni-Cr catalyst and a second stage hydrogenation<br>
reaction is subsequently conducted at<br>
50-150°C and 2.0-5.0 MPa using a Pd/A1203 catalyst. The<br>
first-stage and second-stage hydrogenation reactions<br>
each independently may be either vapor-phase<br>
hydrogenation or liquid-phase hydrogenation. Examples<br>
include "a method in which the first-stage hydrogenation<br>
reaction is a vapor phase reaction and the second-stage<br>
hydrogenation is a vapor-phase reaction", "a method in<br>
which the first-stage hydrogenation reaction is a<br>
liquid-phase reaction and the second-stage hydrogenation<br>
is a liquid-phase reaction", and<br>
"a method in which the first-stage hydrogenation reaction<br>
is a vapor-phase reaction and the second-stage<br>
hydrogenation is a liquid-phase reaction". From the<br>
standpoint of heat recovery, it is preferred that the<br>
first-stage hydrogenation reaction be conducted in a vapor<br>
phase. From the standpoint of reducing the generation of<br>
by-products, it is preferred to conduct the second-stage<br>
hydrogenation reaction in a liquid phase under mild<br>
conditions.<br>
[0026]<br>
The second-stage hydrogenation reaction should be<br>
conducted using a reactor having a fixed bed in such a<br>
manner that the hydrogenation reaction is conducted under<br>
"conditions suitable for the hydrogenation of the<br>
condensate" up to a place in the middle of the catalyst<br>
layer and that after the place in the middle of the<br>
catalyst layer, the hydrogenation reaction is conducted<br>
under "conditions suitable for the hydrogenation of the<br>
high-boiling compounds generated by condensation (the<br>
compound (I)) and compounds having an oxygen-containing<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring<br>
(compounds (II) and (III)) to the corresponding compounds<br>
having a tetrahydropyran ring". Specifically, this can be<br>
accomplished by regulating the temperature of the feed<br>
being sent to the second-stage reactor so that the feed has<br>
a necessary temperature in the area which should have the<br>
"conditions suitable for the hydrogenation of the highboiling<br>
compounds generated by condensation (the compound<br>
(I)) and compounds having an oxygen-containing heterocycle<br>
having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (compounds<br>
(II) and (III)) to the corresponding compounds having a<br>
tetrahydropyran ring", or by regulating the catalyst amount<br>
so that a necessary residence time in the area having the<br>
"conditions suitable for the hydrogenation of the highboiling<br>
compounds generated by condensation (the compound<br>
(I)) and compounds having an oxygen-containing heterocycle<br>
having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (compounds<br>
(II) and (III)) to the corresponding compounds having a<br>
tetrahydropyran ring" can be maintained. This operation<br>
can heighten the degree of hydrogenation of the condensate<br>
(specifically to 98% or higher) and reduce the<br>
concentration of compounds having an oxygen-containing<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring<br>
(compounds having a pyran ring or dihydropyran ring) to or<br>
below the target value.<br>
[0027]<br>
The term "a place in the middle of the catalyst<br>
layer" as used above specifically means a place at which<br>
the degree of hydrogenation of the condensate becomes 98%<br>
or higher and after which the reaction mixture has a<br>
catalyst contact time of 5 minutes or longer in the case of<br>
liquid-phase hydrogenation or of 0.3 seconds or longer in<br>
the case of vapor-phase hydrogenation. Control for<br>
obtaining the conditions suitable for each of the<br>
hydrogenation operations may be accomplished by regulating<br>
the temperature of the reactor inlet or adding a solvent<br>
for heat removal.<br>
[0028]<br>
In the case of liquid-phase hydrogenation, it is<br>
preferred to regulate the superficial linear velocity in<br>
the reactor to 10 m/hr or higher in order to inhibit<br>
channelling in the reactor.<br>
Whichever method described above is used, the<br>
concentration of compounds having an oxygen-containing<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring<br>
(compounds having a pyran ring or dihydropyran ring) in the<br>
crude alcohol (2EH) obtained by the hydrogenation can be<br>
200 weight ppm or lower, especially 100 weight ppm or lower.<br>
In the invention, the crude alcohol (2EH), which has such<br>
a low content of compounds having an oxygen-containing<br>
heterocycle having a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring<br>
(compounds having a pyran ring or dihydropyran ring) , is<br>
distilled to obtain a purified alcohol (2EH) as a product.<br>
In the invention, this alcohol to be subjected to<br>
distillation is referred to as "crude alcohol", and the<br>
step of distilling the crude alcohol to obtain purified<br>
alcohol is the "purification step" in the invention. The<br>
alcohol obtained through the distillation is referred to as<br>
"purified alcohol" in the invention. Examples of the<br>
distillation in the invention include rectification and<br>
flash distillation. This distillation may be conducted by<br>
an ordinary method. For example, it may be conducted using<br>
a distillation column having 20-50 plates at a column top<br>
pressure of from 50 mmHg to atmospheric pressure in such a<br>
manner that the purified 2EH obtained as a distillate has a<br>
purity of 99.5% or higher/ preferably 99.8% or higher.<br>
With respect to pressure in this distillation operation,<br>
however, it is desirable to conduct the operation under a<br>
higher vacuum from the standpoint of the generation of byproducts<br>
in the distillation column and for using a more<br>
inexpensive low-pressure vapor to conduct the distillation.<br>
[0029]<br>
According to the invention, purified 2EH which<br>
shows a coloring of 30 APHA or lower, especially 20 APHA or<br>
lower, in a sulfuric acid coloring test can be easily<br>
obtained. The sulfuric acid coloring test is as follows.<br>
[0030]<br>
Into a dry 300-mL ground-stopper flat bottom flask<br>
is introduced 100 mL of a sample. While the sample is<br>
being stirred, 8 mL of 98 wt% concentrated sulfuric acid is<br>
added thereto at a rate of 2 mL/min at a room temperature<br>
of 30°C or lower. Subsequently, the flask is stoppered and<br>
immersed for 2 hours in a water bath of 98±2°C. This flask<br>
is cooled to room temperature with water. Thereafter, 100<br>
mL of the sample is introduced into a flat-bottom color<br>
comparison tube made of glass having an inner diameter of<br>
25 mm and a height of 270 mm, and is visually compared with<br>
APHA color standard solutions each placed in an amount of<br>
100 mL in the same color comparison tube. The APHA value<br>
for the color standard solution which has the same color as<br>
the sample is taken as a measured value.<br>
[0031]<br>
The APHA color standard solutions are prepared in<br>
the following manner. The ingredients shown below are<br>
dissolved in distilled water so as to precisely result in a<br>
total amount of 1,000 mL. This solution is referred to as<br>
APHA 500.<br>
Potassium chloroplatinate (K2PtCl6) 1.245 g<br>
Cobalt chloride (CoCl2/6H2O) 1.000 g<br>
98% Concentrated sulfuric acid 100 mL<br>
This APHA 500 color standard solution is diluted<br>
with distilled water to produce color standard solutions<br>
having various APHA values. For examples, diluting the<br>
APHA 500 color standard solution with distilled water so as<br>
to double the volume of the solution gives an APHA 250<br>
color standard solution.<br>
[0032]<br>
The invention will be explained in detail by<br>
reference to Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
0033]<br>
Normal butyraldehyde was mixed with 2 wt% aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution and reacted at 90°C. The<br>
liquid reaction mixture was allowed to stand and<br>
separate into layers to thereby obtain 2-ethylhexenal.<br>
The 2-ethylhexenal obtained was distilled with a<br>
distiller having 10 Oldshue plates under the conditions<br>
of a column top pressure of 200 mmHg and a reflux ratio<br>
of 0.23 to remove 99% of the high-boiling compounds.<br>
This 2 ethylhexenal from which high-boiling<br>
compounds had been removed was subjected to liquidphase<br>
hydrogenation at a temperature of 120°C and<br>
a pressure of 4.0 MPa in the presence of an Ni-<br>
Cr catalyst to thereby obtain crude 2EH. This crude 2EH<br>
contained 8 weight ppm dihydropyran compound and 0<br>
weight ppm pyran compound.<br>
[0034]<br>
This crude 2EH was distilled with a distiller<br>
having 35 Oldshue plates under the condi tions of a<br>
column top pressure of 100 mmHg and a reflux ratio of 7<br>
to thereby remove low-boiling compounds from the crude<br>
2EH. The crude 2EH was successively distilled at a<br>
column top pressure of 100 mmHg to thereby remove highboiling<br>
compounds from the crude 2EH. Thus, the crude<br>
2EH was purified. The purified 2EH obtained had a purity<br>
of 99.9%, a dihydropyran compound concentration of 1.4<br>
weight ppm, and a pyran compound concentration of 0<br>
weight ppm. In the<br>
sulfuric acid coloring test, this purified 2EH showed a coloring<br>
of 5 APHA.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0035]<br>
The crude 2EH obtained in Example 1 was distilled to obtain<br>
purified 2EH having a dihydropyran compound concentration of 0<br>
weight ppm and a pyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm.<br>
The dihydropyran compound represented by general formula (III)<br>
was added to this purified 2EH in various concentrations.<br>
The resultant solutions were subjected to the sulfuric acid<br>
coloring test. The results obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0036]<br>
[Table 1]<br>
(Table Removed) [0037]<br>
Fig. 1 was drawn from the results given in Table 1. When<br>
this figure is used, the results of the sulfuric acid coloring<br>
test can be determined from the concentration of the compound of<br>
general formula (III) in the 2EH.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0038]<br>
Normal butyraldehyde was mixed with 2 wt% aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution and reacted at 90°C. The liquid<br>
reaction mixture was allowed to stand and separate into<br>
layers to thereby obtain 2-ethylhexenal.<br>
The 2-ethylhexenal obtained was subjected to vaporphase<br>
hydrogenation at a temperature of 190°C and a<br>
pressure of 0.45 MPa in the presence of a Cu-Cr-Mn-Ba-Ni<br>
catalyst (nickel content, 1%) to react about 90% of the 2-<br>
ethylhexenal.<br>
[0039]<br>
This liquid hydrogenation reaction mixture was<br>
vaporized and fed, together with hydrogen gas, to a fixedbed<br>
reactor packed with an Ni-Zr catalyst. The feed<br>
temperature was regulated so that the temperature as<br>
measured at a place located in the 3/4 position from the<br>
inlet of the catalyst layer became 140° C. Vapor-phase<br>
hydrogenation was conducted at a pressure of 0.45 MPa.<br>
This reaction was conducted while supplying the feed<br>
material at such a rate that the gas space velocity (GHSV)<br>
as measured in the catalyst layer after the 3/4 position<br>
from the inlet became 10,000 Hr"1 or lower. The crude 2EH<br>
obtained by this reaction had a dihydropyran compound<br>
concentration of 129 weight ppm and a pyran compound<br>
concentration of 0 weight ppm. Furthermore, the gas was<br>
sampled in the 3/4 position from the inlet of the catalyst<br>
layer and condensed. The resultant liquid was analyzed by<br>
gas chromatography. As a result, 2-ethylhexenal was not<br>
detected and 100% of the 2-ethylhexenal feed was found to<br>
have been hydrogenated. This liquid had a dihydropyran<br>
compound concentration of 1,310 weight ppm and a pyran<br>
compound concentration of 0 weight ppm.<br>
[0040]<br>
The step of distilling the crude 2EH to obtain<br>
purified 2EH in the same manner as in Example 1 was<br>
simulated to determine the pyran compound and dihydropyran<br>
compound concentrations in the purified 2EH. As a result,<br>
the purified 2EH obtained was found to have a purity of<br>
99.9%, dihydropyran compound concentration of 67 weight ppm,<br>
and pyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm. It can<br>
be seen from Fig. 1 that this purified 2EH shows a coloring<br>
of 20 APHA in the sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0041]<br>
Normal butyraldehyde was mixed with 2 wt% aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution and reacted at 90°C. The liquid<br>
reaction mixture was allowed to stand and separate into<br>
layers to thereby obtain 2-ethylhexenal.<br>
The 2-ethylhexenal obtained was subjected to liquidphase<br>
hydrogenation at a temperature of 120°C and a<br>
pressure of 4.0 MPa in the presence of an Ni-Cr catalyst to<br>
react about 90% of the 2-ethylhexenal.<br>
[0042]<br>
This liquid hydrogenation reaction mixture was<br>
further fed to a fixed-bed reactor packed with a 5%-<br>
Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The feed temperature was regulated so<br>
that the temperature as measured at a place located in the<br>
3/4 position from the inlet of the catalyst layer became<br>
130°C. Liquid-phase hydrogenation was conducted at a<br>
pressure of 5.0 MPa. This reaction was conducted while<br>
supplying the feed material at such a rate that the<br>
residence time in the catalyst layer after the 3/4 position<br>
from the inlet became 10 minutes or longer. The crude 2EH<br>
obtained by this reaction had a dihydropyran compound<br>
concentration of 0 weight ppm and a pyran compound<br>
concentration of 0 weight ppm. Furthermore, the liquid was<br>
sampled in the 3/4 position from the inlet of the catalyst<br>
layer and analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, 2-<br>
ethylhexenal was not detected and 100% of the 2-<br>
ethylhexenal feed was found to have been hydrogenated.<br>
This liquid had a dihydropyran compound concentration of<br>
384 weight ppm and a pyran compound concentration of 0<br>
weight ppm.<br>
[0043]<br>
The step of distilling the crude 2EH to obtain<br>
purified 2EH in the same manner as in Example 1 was<br>
simulated to determine the pyran compound and dihydropyran<br>
compound concentrations in the purified 2EH. As a result,<br>
the purified 2EH obtained was found to have a purity of<br>
99.9%, dihydropyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm,<br>
and pyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm. It can<br>
be seen from Fig. 1 that this purified 2EH shows a coloring<br>
of 5 APHA in the sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0044]<br>
The step of distilling crude 2EH having a<br>
dihydropyran compound concentration of 200 weight ppm and a<br>
pyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm to obtain<br>
purified 2EH in the same manner as in Example 1 was<br>
simulated to determine the pyran compound and dihydropyran<br>
compound concentrations in the purified 2EH. As a result,<br>
the purified 2EH obtained was found to have a purity of<br>
99.9%, dihydropyran compound concentration of 105 weight<br>
ppm, and pyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm. It<br>
can be seen from Fig. 1 that this purified 2EH shows a<br>
coloring of 30 APHA in the sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
[COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1]<br>
[O045]<br>
Normal butyraldehyde was mixed with 2 wt% aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution and reacted at 90°C. The liquid<br>
reaction mixture was allowed to stand and separate into<br>
layers to thereby obtain 2-ethylhexenal.<br>
The 2-ethylhexenal obtained was subjected to liquidphase<br>
hydrogens tion at a temperature of 120° C and a<br>
pressure of 4.0 MPa in the presence of an Ni-Cr catalyst to<br>
thereby obtain crude 2EH. This crude 2EH contained 878<br>
weight ppm dihydropyran compound and 0 weight ppm pyran<br>
compound.<br>
[0046]<br>
The step of distilling the crude 2EH to obtain<br>
purified 2EH in the same manner as in Example 1 was<br>
simulated to determine the pyran compound and dihydropyran<br>
compound concentrations in the purified 2EH. As a result,<br>
the purified 2EH obtained was found to have a purity of<br>
99.9%, dihydropyran compound concentration of 359 weight<br>
ppm, and pyran compound concentration of 0 weight ppm. It<br>
can be seen from Fig. 1 that this purified 2EH shows a<br>
coloring of 100 APHA in the sulfuric acid coloring test.<br>
[0047]<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and<br>
with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications can be made therein without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
