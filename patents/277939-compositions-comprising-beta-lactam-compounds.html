				<td>COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING BETA LACTAM COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising at least 95 wt% of a (3-lactam compound as well as to a process for their production and a process for the production of semi-synthetic antibiotics.<br>
Synthetic routes to prepare semi-synthetic penicillins (SSP's) and semi-synthetics cephalosporins (SSC's) usually start from fermentation products such as penicillin G (PenG), penicillin V (PenV) and/or Cephalosporin C (CefC). These compounds may be converted to the corresponding B-lactam intermediates such as 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), 7-amino-desacetoxy-cephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA), 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), 7-amino-3-chloro-3-cephem-4-carboxylate (7-ACCA), 7-amino-3-[(Z/E)-1-propen-1-yl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylate (7-PACA) and others as is disclosed in K. Matsumoto, Bioprocess. Techn.,16, (1993), 67-88, J.G. Shewale &amp; H. Sivaraman, Process Biochemistry, August 1989, 146-154, T.A. Savidge, Biotechnology of Industrial Antibiotics (Ed. E.J. Vandamme) .Marcel Dekker, New York, 1984, or J.G. Shewale et a!., Process Biochemistry International, June 1990, 97-103.<br>
For instance 6-APA may be obtained from PenG or PenV via chemical or enzymatic cleavage of the phenylacetic acid side or hydroxyphenylacetic acid side chain respectively. Pen G and PenV are both secondary metabolites produced and excreted by the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum in large scale industrial fermentation processes (see R.P. Elander in Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol (2003) 61:385-392 for a review). In some of these processes, PenG is produced in a crystalline form as an intermediate, in other processes, this step is avoided and the side chain is cleaved off directly in an aqueous PenG-solution obtained after extraction and back extraction of the Pen-G from the fermentation broth - see WO98/40839.<br>
The first generation 7-ADCA product was derived from PenG whereby both the expansion of the 5-membered penem ring to the 6-membered cephem ring and the subsequent cleavage of the phenylacetic acid side chain of the phenylacetyl-7-ADCA were carried out using chemical reactions. The next generation 7-ADCA product was still obtained from PenG but after the chemical ring expansion, the phenylacetic acid side chain of the phenylacetyl-7-ADCA was cleaved off enzymatically using a suitable (penicillin) acylase. Other processes have been developed wherein also the ring expansion of PenG to phenylacetyl-7-ADCA is carried out in vitro using a suitable expandase   enzyme,    but   these   processes    are   of   little   industrial   importance.<br>
The most recent and most elegant production process for 7-ADCA comprises the culturing of a Penicillium chrysogenum, transformed with and expressing a gene encoding a suitable expandase. This engineered Penicillium chrysogenum strain, when grown in the presence of adipic acid as the side chain precursor in the fermentation vessel, produces and excretes adipyl-7-ADCA - see WO93/05158. In this production process, the adipyl-7-ADCA is recovered from the fermentation broth, subjected to a suitable acylase to cleave of the adipic acid side chain after which the 7-ADCA thus obtained is further purified, crystallized and dried. Other side chains precursors have been disclosed in WO95/04148 (2-(carboxyethylthio)acetic acid and 3-(carboxymethylthio)-propionic acid), WO95/04149 (2-(carboxyethylthio)propionic acid), WO96/38580 (phenyl acetic acid) and WO98/048034 and WO98/048035 (various dicarboxyiic acids). The expandase takes care of the expansion of the 5-membered ring of the various N-acylated penicillanic acids, thereby yielding the corresponding N-acylated desacetoxycephalosporanic acids.<br>
Production of other B-lactam intermediates such as 7-ACA, 7-ACCA and 7-PACA has been amply documented in the patent and scientific literature and are known to the skilled person.<br>
The B-lactam intermediates are subsequently converted to the desired SSP or SSC by coupling to a suitable side chain, as has been described in inter alia EP 0 339 751, JP-A-53005185 and CH-A-640 240. By making different combinations of side chains and B-lactam intermediates, a variety of semi-synthetic penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics may be obtained such as amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephalexin, cefadroxil, cephradine, cefaclor and cefprozil. In the case of the chemical coupling of the side chain to a B-Iactam intermediate, the carboxyl group of the B-iactam intermediate is first silylated in in order to promote the dissolution of the insoluble 3-lactam intermediate in the organic solvent system.<br>
The dissolution rate of a B-lactam intermediate composition is dependent on many factors such as particle size, purity of the B-lactam intermediate composition, absence or presence of impurities or water, temperature, type of organic solvent etceteras. We have now surprisingly found that compositions comprising at least 95% of a P-lactam intermediate and further containing between 0.02 and 5 wt% ammonium chloride and/or a corresponding amount of the HCI salt of an organic amine (based on molecular weight),  have  superior dissolution   rates  compared  to  compositions  not<br>
containing ammonium chloride and/or a corresponding amount of the HCI salt of an organic amine.<br>
In a first aspect the invention provides a composition comprising at least 90 wt% of a ß-lactam compound characterized in that It contains between 0.02 and 5 wt% ammonium chloride and/or a corresponding amount of the HCI salt of an organic amine (based on molecular weight). Preferably the ß-lactam compound is a ß-lactam intermediate, which may be selected from the group consisting of 6-APA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACA, 7-ACCA and 7-PACA. More preferably, the [3-lactam intermediate is 6-APA or 7-ADCA, most preferably the p-lactam intermediate is 7-ADCA.<br>
The composition of the invention comprises at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 96%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 98% and most preferably at least 99% of the ß-lactam intermediate. The ammonium chloride content of the composition of the invention is between 0.02 and 5 wt%, more preferably between 0.02 and 4 wt%, more preferably between 0.03 and 3 wt%, more preferably between 0.04 and 2 wt% and most preferably between 0.05 and 1wt%. Likewise, embodiments of the invention comprising the HCI salt of an organic amine, have a content of the HCI salt of an organic amine which is preferably in amounts corresponding to those of ammonium chloride (based on molecular weight). Embodiments containing both ammonium chloride and the HCI salt of an organic amine, contain amounts that correspond to those stated for ammonium chloride alone (based on molecular weights).<br>
The advantage of the composition of the invention is that it combines a very high purity with respect to the p-lactam intermediate and improved dissolution behaviour in silylation reactions, compared to a composition not containing between 0.02 and 5 wt% ammonium chloride and/or a corresponding amount of the HCI salt of an organic amine (based on molecular weight).<br>

For the preferred embodiment wherein the ß-lactam intermediate is a cephalosporin intermediate such as 7-ACA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACCA or 7-PACA, the composition may preferably have a very low 6-APA content. For oral administration of the semi-synthetic cephalosporins, the 6-APA content in the composition of the invention<br>
comprising a cephalosporin intermediate such as 7-ACA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACCA or 7-PACA is preferably less than 50 ppm, more preferably less than 40 ppm, more preferably less than 30 ppm, more preferably less than 20 ppm.andrnost preferably less than-10 ppm. For parental administration, the 6-APA content in the composition of the invention comprising a cephalosporin intermediate such as 7-ACA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACCA or 7-PACA, is preferably less than 10 ppm.<br>
For the preferred embodiment wherein the p-lactam intermediate is a cephalosporin intermediate such as 7-ACA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACCA or 7-PACA, the composition of the invention preferably does not contain phenylacetic acid. This means that, by applying analytical methods known in the art for the detection of phenylacetic acid to determine the content of phenylacetic acid in the composition of the invention, the response of said analytical methods remains below the detection limit for said compounds. This means that the composition of the invention comprising a cephalosporin intermediate such as 7-ACA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACCA or 7-PACA as the ß-lactam intermediate preferably comprises equal to or less than 4 ppm phenylacetic acid.<br>
In a second aspect the invention provides a process for the production of the composition of the invention comprising contacting a composition comprising the ß-lactam compound and which does not contain ammonium chloride and/or the HCI salt of an organic amine with ammonium chloride and/or the HCI salt of an organic amine. Preferably the ß-lactam compound is a ß-lactam intermediate, which may be selected from the group consisting of 6-APA, 7-ADCA, 7-ACA, 7-ACCA and 7-PACA. More preferably, the ß-lactam intermediate is 6-APA or 7-ADCA, most preferably the p-lactam intermediate is 7-ADCA.

These concentrations preferably are between 0.25 and 5 wt%, more preferably between 0.5 and 2.5 wt%. Drying of the washed crystals may be carried out according to methods known in the art until a water content is reached as described hereinbefore for the composition of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect; the invention provides a process for the production of semisynthetics antibiotics comprising silylating the composition of the invention.

In a fourth aspect, the invention provides the use of the composition of the invention for the chemical synthesis of semi-synthetic p-lactam antibiotics. The composition of the invention comprising 6-APA as the B-lactam intermediate may be used for the production of semi-synthetic penicillins, while the composition of the invention comprising a cephalosporin intermediate, such as 7-ADCA, 7-ACA, 7-ACCA or 7-PACA may be used for the production of semi-synthetic cephalosporins.

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 <br>
Preparation of a composition comprising 7-ADCA and ammonium chloride<br>
Adipyl-7-ADCA was produced in a fermentation process using an engineered Penicillium chrysogenum strain as described in WO93/05158. The adipyl-7-ADCA was recovered, deacylated to 7-ADCA and the 7-ADCA crystallized as described in WO98/48035 and WO98/48036. Five litres of an aqueous suspension of 7-ADCA crystals (between 40-50 g/L 7-ADCA) was filtered over a G3 filter with a diameter of 13 cm using a vacuum pump. The 7-ADCA crystals were rinsed twice with one bed volume of a 1.5 wt% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (NH4CI). After the second rinse, the crystals were dried on the G3 filter for 20 minutes. Approximately 100 gram of the crystals was dried for 2 hours in an oven at 102°C. The bed volume was calculated from the height of the crystal cake on the filter and the diameter of the filter.<br>
Table .1<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In a control experiment, the 7-ADCA crystals were rinsed twice with one bed volume of demineralised water and treated further as described for the ammonium chloride washed crystals. The results obtained are listed in Table 1.<br>
Example 2 Silylation times of the compositions as prepared in Example 1<br>
The silylation time of 7-ADCA was measured as follows. Approximately 16 gram of dried 7-ADCA crystals prepared as described in Example 1 and approximately 19 grams of bis-trimethylsilyl-urea (BSU) were added to a 3-neck round bottom flask of 500 ml (Duran Scott NS29.2/32) with the aid of a powder funnel. A stirring rod with Teflon blade (type Sovirel CN 29/32) and a control thermometer (LET 5450 DIN 12778 mounted in a glass stopper 29/32) were place in the flask. The flask was placed in a waterbath which was adjusted to 25.5 + 0.5°C (resulting in a reaction temperature of 25.0± 0.5°C). Subsequently 277 ml of DMF (chemical grade) was added. The stirring rod was connected to a stirrer (Janke and Kunkel, IKA werk, type RW 20 DZM) and the stirring speed was adjusted between 205 and 215 rpm.<br>
0.1 ml of TMCA (trimethylchlorosilane) was added to the flask and the flask was closed a rubber stop to which a "fiber optic probe is mounted. The "fiber optic probe -was connected to a Metrohm type 662 photometer which was adjusted to a wavelength of 625 nm.<br>
The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at regular intervals (ca 10 minutes). The value of the absorbance of the initial reaction mixture was very high (&gt;2 AU = absorbance units). Upon progress of the silylation reaction, the insoluble 7-ADCA is dissolved which results in a decrease of the absorbance. The silylation time is defined as the time between the start of the reaction and the time point at which the absorbance has decreased to an AU-value of 0.1<br>
Table 2 shows that 7-ADCA crystals washed with an aquous solution of ammonium chloride according to Example 1 have a silylation time of approximately 2 hours. In the experiment wtth the control crystals (washed with water) the AU remained at the initial value of &gt;2 for at least 4 hours.<br>
