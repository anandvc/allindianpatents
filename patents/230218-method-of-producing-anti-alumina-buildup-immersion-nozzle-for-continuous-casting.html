				<td>METHOD OF PRODUCING ANTI-ALUMINA-BUILDUP IMMERSION<br>
NOZZLE FOR CONTINUOUS CASTING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing an immersion nozzle for<br>
continuous casting, and more particularly to a method of producing an anti-alumina-buildup<br>
immersion nozzle with an inner hole whose wall surface serving as a molten-steel flow passage<br>
is formed of a CaO-containing material to prevent buildup of alumina thereon.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
With increasingly strict quality control demanded of steel products, the buildup of<br>
non-metallic inclusions, such as alumina, on the wall surface of an inner hole of a submerged or<br>
immersion nozzle has a serious disadvantage for steel production. Therefore, a good deal of<br>
effort has been made to reduce the buildup of non-metallic inclusions, such as alumina, on the<br>
wall surface of an inner hole of an immersion nozzle for continuous casting (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "immersion nozzle" or "nozzle").<br>
As one of measures against the alumina buildup, there has been known a technique in<br>
which argon gas is injected from the inner surface of a nozzle into molten steel to prevent the<br>
alumina buildup in physical manner. In this technique, if the argon gas is injected excessively,<br>
bubbles of the injected argon gas will be incorporated into molten steel to form pinholes in slabs.<br>
Thus, due to the restriction in the allowable injection amount of argon gas, this method cannot<br>
be fully employed as a sufficient measure to prevent alumina buildup.<br>
There has also been known a technique intended to provide an anti-alumina-buildup<br>
function to refractories themselves. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
57-71860 discloses a casting nozzle using refractories including a combination of graphite and<br>
either one of sintered calcia, fused calcia and another ceramic material containing a CaO<br>
component. This invention is intended to induce a reaction between CaO contained in the<br>
refractories and alumina attached on the wall surface of a nozzle inner hole so as to form a<br><br>
low-melting-point or fusible substance to prevent the alumina buildup.<br>
Such CaO-containing refractories exhibit a certain level of anti-alumina-buildup effect.<br>
In particular, refractories using a clinker containing CaO as a mineral phase, such as<br>
calcia-magnesia clinkers including calcia clinker and dolomite clinker, have an excellent effect.<br>
For this reason, immersion nozzles have been increasingly produced by integrally molding<br>
a compound using a clinker containing CaO as a mineral phase, which is applied to only an<br>
inner hole portion of an immersion nozzle or an nozzle body including the inner hole portion,<br>
and a zirconia-graphite compound applied to a powder-line portion of the nozzle, and then<br>
burning the molded piece in a reduction atmosphere.<br>
This production method involves a problem concerning cracks to be generated at the<br>
boundary between the different compositions during the burning process. This would be<br>
because phenol resin, which is added to the CaO-containing refractories at about several % to<br>
less than 20% as a binder or for forming a carbon bond in the refractory matrix, decomposes<br>
during heating to release water therefrom, and the resulting hydration reaction between the<br>
water and the CaO contained as a mineral phase in the clinker causes volume expansion<br>
different from the expanding behaviors in other portions during heating.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-514394 proposes one measure against<br>
this problem, in which a CaO-containing powder is added into a zirconia-graphite compound for<br>
use in a powder-line portion so as to equalize expanding behavior in each portion to prevent the<br>
occurrence of cracks. However, the CaO-containing powder added to the zirconia-graphite<br>
compound causes deterioration in corrosion resistance, resulting in undesirably deteriorated<br>
durability of a powder-line portion to be formed of the compound.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In view of the problem in the conventional immersion-nozzle production method<br>
comprising integrally molding a zirconia-graphite compound applied to a powder -line portion of<br>
an immersion nozzle, and a compound using a clinker containing CaO as a mineral phase, which<br>
is applied to at least an inner hole portion of the nozzle to prevent alumina buildup, and then<br>
burning the molded piece in a reduction atmosphere, it is therefore an object of the present<br><br>
invention to provide an improved immersion-nozzle production method capable of preventing<br>
the occurrence of cracks to be generatodduring the burning process.<br>
work Through researchwork to wards solving the above conventional problem, the inventor<br>
found that one factor of the occurrence of cracks as the problem in the conventional production<br>
method, or the volume expansion arising during the burning process, can be prevented by<br>
subjecting the clinker containing CaO as a mineral phase to an anti-hydration treatment so as to<br>
suppress the hydration reaction between the CaO and the water released from the resin. The<br>
present invention has been accomplished based on this knowledge.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a method of producing an immersion nozzle<br>
for continuous casting, which has zirconia-graphite refractories applied to a powder-line portion<br>
thereof. The method comprises integrally molding the zirconia-graphite refractories, and a<br>
compound applied to at least an inner hole portion of the immersion nozzle. The compound<br>
includes 10 weight % or more of clinker particles each containing CaO as a mineral phase,<br>
wherein the surface of at least a part of the particles is subjected to an anti-hydration treatment.<br>
The anti-hydration treatment for the clinker containing CaO as a mineral phase may<br>
specifically performed by converting the CaO exposed outside from the surface of the clinker<br>
particle, to a compound nonreactive with water, or by coating the entire clinker particle with a<br>
film impermeable to water.<br>
In the former treatment, the CaO may be converted to a water-stable compound, such as<br>
CaCO3, CaSO4 or Ca3 (PO4)2 For example, the CaO may be converted to CaCO3 by<br>
subjecting untreated clinker to a heat treatment under a CO2 atmosphere at a temperature of 300<br>
to 850°C.<br>
In the latter treatment for coating the entire clinker particle with a film impermeable to<br>
water, the water-impermeable film may be formed using heat-resistant resin, such as silicone<br>
resin; pitch; or magnesium sulfate.<br>
Among the above anti-hydration treatment, the treatment of converting the CaO exposed<br>
outside from the surface of the clinker particle, to CaCO3, is most preferable in view of<br>
treatment cost, anti-hydration performance, and influence on the quality of the refractories after<br>
the burning process.<br><br>
While it would be preferable to subject all of the clinker particles to the anti-hydration<br>
treatment, only a part of the clinker particles may be subjected to the treatment as long as an<br>
intended effect can be achieved.<br>
The refractory compound comprising calcia-magnesia clinker including a dolomite clinker<br>
and a calcia clinker containing CaO as a mineral phase may be a mixture of such clinkers and<br>
binder. The refractory compound may selectively include any other suitable aggregate, such as<br>
CaZrO3 clinker containing CaO without CaO as a mineral phase, material primarily consisting<br>
of a CaO-SiO2 clinker and another CaO-based compound, oxide, carbide or carbon, etc.<br>
In view of the anti-alumina-buildup function, the amount of the clinker particles each<br>
containing CaO as a mineral phase is 10 mass% or more, preferably 20 mass% or more, even<br>
more preferably 30 mass% or more, on the basis of 100 mass% of the entire compound. The<br>
body of the immersion nozzle may be made of any suitable conventional material.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional view of a dolomite clinker subjected to an anti-hydration<br>
treatment in one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in connection of<br>
the Examples.<br>
Table 1 shows the composition of compound including clinker particles each containing<br>
CaO as a mineral phase, the application of a heat treatment performed under a CO2 atmosphere<br>
to convert the CaO exposed outside from the surface of the clinker particle, to CaCO3, and the<br>
inspection result of the presence of cracks after the burning process.<br>
Each specimen for the testing was prepared by applying a zirconia-graphite on the<br>
powder-line portion and a compound shown in Table 1 onto the main body or the inner hole<br>
portion other than the powder-line portion, and carrying the whole body to CEP molding under a<br>
pressure of 1000 Kg/cm2, or 98 Mpa, and burning under a reduction atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of 1000°C.<br><br><br>
In Table 1, all of the dolomite clinker particles in Inventive Examples 1 to 3 were subjected<br>
to a heat treatment under a CO2 atmosphere, or an anti-hydration treatment. The dolomite<br>
clinker particles in Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were conventional clinkers without application<br>
of the anti-hydration treatment. The compound to be applied to the portion of the nozzle other<br>
than the powder-line portion comprises either one of clinkers as shown in Table 1, which<br>
contains CaO as a mineral phase. This compound was prepared by homogenously kneading<br>
the clinker particles and an appropriate amount of phenol resin added thereto. The<br>
zirconia-graphite compound comprises 90 mass% of zirconia and 10 mass% of graphite. The<br>
zirconia-graphite compound was prepared by homogenously kneading the zirconia, the graphite<br>
and an appropriate amount of phenol resin added thereto, and commonly applied to all of the<br>
immersion nozzles in Table 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional view of the dolomite clinker particle as shown in Table 1,<br>
which is subjected to an anti-hydration treatment for converting CaO contained in the clinker<br>
particle and exposed outside from the surface of the clinker particle, to CaCO3.<br>
Each of Inventive Examples 1 to 3 using the clinker particles subjected to the<br>
anti-hydration treatment could avoid the occurrence of cracks during the burning process. In<br><br>
contrast, all of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 had transverse cracks at the boundary between the<br>
CaO-containing refractories and the zirconia-graphite refractories.<br>
Table 1 also shows Inventive Examples 4 to 6 each of which includes calcia clinker<br>
particles and dolomite clinker particles which are subjected to the heat treatment under a CO2<br>
atmosphere, or the anti-hydration treatment. The dolomite clinker particles in Comparative<br>
Examples 4 to 6 were conventional clinkers without application of the anti-hydration treatment.<br>
In Inventive Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6, the nozzle body was formed of<br>
a magnesia-graphite compound prepared by adding an appropriate amount of phenol resin to 70<br>
mass% of magnesia and 30 mass% of graphite, and homogenously kneading them. A<br>
compound including clinker particles each containing CaO as a mineral phase was applied only<br>
to the inner hole portion.<br>
As seen in the results of Inventive Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6, each<br>
of Inventive Examples using the clinker particles subjected to the anti-hydration treatment could<br>
avoid the occurrence of cracks during the burning process. In contrast, all of Comparative<br>
Examples had transverse cracks at the boundary between the zirconia-graphite refractories and<br>
the magnesia-graphite refractories, a part of which extended toward the outer periphery of the<br>
nozzle.<br>
As mentioned above, the method of the present invention can provide an immersion nozzle<br>
for continuous casting, with an excellent anti-alumina-buildup function, while preventing the<br>
occurrence of cracks during the burning process to provide enhanced process yield. The<br>
obtained immersion nozzle can contribute to the improvement in operational efficiency of<br>
continuous casting and in steel quality.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
