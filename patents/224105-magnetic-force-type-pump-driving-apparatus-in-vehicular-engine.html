[See Section 10]<br>
"MAGNETIC FORCE TYPE PUMP DRIVING APPARATUS IN VEHICULAR ENGINE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes .the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
31-1-2007<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Fie-ldâ€”t-o- which the -Invention- Belongs] <br>
The present invention relates to a magnetic force type pump driving apparatus in a vehicular engine, particularly to an improvement in a constitution in which a driving magnet in a ring-like shape is fixedly attached to a driven rotating member which is fixedly attached to one end of a driven shaft of a wrapping transmission apparatus connecting a crank shaft and a driven shaft, a driven magnet concentrically arranged to an inner peripheral side of the driving magnet such that torque can be transmitted to each other, is axially supported rotatably by a pump hosing arranged between the two magnets and a pump rotating member is connected to the driven magnet. <br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Such a magnetic type pump driving apparatus has already been known as is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 89069/1998. .<br><br><br>
[Problem that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
In such a magnetic force type pump driving apparatus, transmission torque between the driving and the driven magnets, is significantly dependent on diameters of these.  However, according to the conventional apparatus, as shown by the above-described publication, the driving magnet is fixedly attached to an inner peripheral face of a hub having a cylindrical shape of the driven rotating member and accordingly, large diameter formation of the driving and the driven magnets is restricted by the driven rotating member and it is difficult to achieve an increase in the transmission torque therebetween by the large diameter formation of the driving and the driven magnets.<br>
The invention has been carried out in view of such a situation and it is an object thereof to provide a magnetic force type pump driving apparatus in a vehicular engine enabling large diameter formation of a driving and a driven magnet without being interfered by the driven rotating member of the wrapping transmission apparatus, capable of achieving an increase in transmission torque and capable of being constituted comparatively compactly.<br>
 [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, the invention is firstly characterized in-that in a magnetic force type pump driving apparatus in a vehicular engine in which a driving magnet in a ring-like shape is fixedly attached to a<br><br><br>
driven rotating member fixedly attached to one end of a driven shaft of a wrapping transmission apparatus for connecting a crank shaft and the driven shaft, a driven magnet arranged to an inner peripheral side of the driving magnet concentrically to be able to transmit a torque mutually, is axially supported rotatably by a pump housing arranged between the two magnets and a pump rotating member is connected to the driven magnet, wherein a magnet holder crossing a rotation center face of a wrapping member of the wrapping transmission apparatus, is fixedly attached to the driven rotating member, the driving magnet arranged at an outer side of the driven rotating member, is attached to the magnet holder and the driven magnet is axially supported by the pump housing arranged to cross the rotation center face on an inner peripheral side of the driving magnet.<br>
Further, the driven shaft, the wrapping transmission apparatus, the driven rotating member, the wrapping member and the pump rotating member, correspond respectively to a cam shaft 34, a timing controlling transmission apparatus 35, a driven sprocket 37, a timing chain 38 and a pump impeller 48 in an embodiment of the invention, described later.<br><br>
According to the first characteristic, the driving magnet arranged at the outer side of the driven rotating member is attached to the magnet holder and therefore, large diameter formation of the driving and the driven magnets is enabled without being interfered by the driven rotating member of the wrapping transmission apparatus and an increase in<br><br><br>
transmission torque of these can be achieved. Further, the magnet holder supporting the driving magnet and the pump housing supporting the driven magnet are arranged such that these cross the rotation center face of the wrapping member and therefore, a space on an inner peripheral side of the driven rotating member, constitutes a space for containing portions of the magnet holder and the pump housing and a total of the pump driving apparatus can be restrained from enlarging in the axial direction.<br>
Further, in addition to the first characteristic, the invention is secondarily characterized in that"the driven rotating member is fixedly attached to an end face of the driven shaft'by a plurality of pieces of bolts arranged around an axis line of the driven shaft and a boss projected from an outer side face of the pump housing for axially supporting the driven magnet is made to face a space surrounded by head portions of the bolts.<br>
According to the second characteristic, the pump housing can be arranged to be as proximate as possible to the driven shaft while avoiding mutual interference between the bolts and the boss and accordingly, space efficiency oh the inner peripheral side of the driven rotating member is promoted, which can contribute to compact formation of the pump driving apparatus.<br><br>

As shown by Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, an engine main body 23 of the engine 20 is provided with a cylinder block 25 having a cylinder bore 25a to which a piston 24 is slidably fitted, a cylinder head 27 coupled to an end face of the cylinder block 25 and partitioning a combustion chamber 26 between a top face of the piston 24 and the cylinder head 27 and a crank case (not illustrated) for rotatably supporting a crank shaft 29 connected to the piston 24 via a connecting rod 28, and the cylinder head 27 is screwed with an ignition plug 60 an electrode of which faces the combustion chamber 26. Further, the cylinder block 25 and cylinder head 27 are formed with water jackets 31 for flowing cooling water.<br><br><br>
A valve operating chamber 32 is partitioned between the cylinder head 27 and a head cover 51 coupled to the cylinder head 27, in the valve operating chamber 32, there is arranged a valve operating mechanism 33 for driving to open and close intake and exhaust valves 30i and 30e attached to the head cover 27 and a cam shaft 34 constituting a portion of the mechanism<br>
33	is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 27 in parallel<br>
with the crank shaft 29. The cam shaft 34 is connected to the<br>
crank shaft 29 via a timing controlling transmission apparatus<br>
35.<br>
The timing controlling transmission apparatus 35 is constituted by a driving sprocket 36 fixedly attached to one end portion of the crank shaft 29, a driven sprocket 37 fixedly attached to one end portion of the cam shaft 34 and an endless timing chain 38 made to wrap on the two sprockets 36 and 37 for transmitting rotation of the crank shaft 29 to the cam shaft<br>
34	by reducing speed by a speed reducing ratio of one half.<br>
The timing controlling transmission apparatus 35 is arranged<br>
in a timing controlling chamber 39 formed at a side wall of<br>
the cylinder block 25 and continuous the valve operating<br>
chamber 32.<br><br>
On one side of the cylinder head 27, there is provided a water pump 40 for circulating cooling water in a cooling water circuit including the water jackets 31. The water pump 40 is provided with a pump housing 41 constituted by an inner side housing half 41a projected to a side of the valve operating<br><br>
chamber 32 and an outer side housing half 41b coupled to one side of the cylinder head 27 along with the inner side housing half 41a and a pump chamber 42 is formed in the outer side housing half 41b. The seal member 43 is interposed at a bond portion of the two housing halves 41a and 41b, and a seal member 44 is interposed also at a bond portion of the outer side housing half 41b and the cylinder head 27 to thereby make the pump chamber 42 watertight.<br>
At walls of the two housing halves 41a and 41b opposed to each other, there are formed bosses 45 and 45' coaxially aligned with the cam shaft 34, and a pump shaft 47 in a cylindrical shape is rotatably supported by a support shaft 46 both ends of which are supported by the bosses 45 and 45' and a pump impeller 48 contained in the pump chamber 42 is fixedly provided to the pump shaft 47. The outer side housing half 41b is formed with a delivery pipe 49 communicating with an outer peripheral portion of the pump chamber 42 and provided with a thermostat 50 for opening and closing the delivery pipe 49 . When the thermostat 50 is opened, cooling water sucked from a radiator, not illustrated, to a central portion of the pump chamber 42, is pressurized by rotation of the pump impeller 48, supplied to the water jackets 31 via the delivery pipe 49 and cools the engine main body 23. Cooling water which has finished cooling is recirculated to the radiator.<br><br>
A side cover 54 bonded to an outer side face of the outer side housing half 41b, is provided with an inlet pipe 62 of<br><br>
a bypass water pass for returning cooling water delivered from the pump chamber 42 directly to the water jackets 31 without detouring to the radiator, not illustrated, when the thermostat 50 is closed.<br><br>
There is constituted a magnetic force type pump driving apparatus 55 according to the invention for driving the water pump 40 between the driven sprocket 37 and the water pump 40. An explanation will be given of the constitution as follows.<br><br>
The driven sprocket 37 is integrally provided with a hub 37a in a shape of a bottomed cylinder buldged to a side of the cam shaft 34 at its central portion and a bottom portion of the hub 37a is fixedly attached to one end face of the cam shaft 34 by a plurality of pieces of bolts 53 along with a magnet holder 56 coaxially laminated therewith. At this occasion, the plurality of pieces of bolts 53 are arranged around an axis line of the cam shaft 34.<br><br>
The magnet holder 56 is constituted by pressing a nonmagnetic stainless steel plate and is formed in a shape of a bottomed and stepped cylinder. That is, the magnet holder 56 is constituted by integrally connecting a large diameter cylindrical portion 56b having a diameter larger than an inner diameter of the. hub 37a to an opening end of a small diameter cylindrical portion 56a which is bottomed and is provided with a diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the hub 37a via a ring-like stepped portion.  The small diameter cylindrical<br><br>
portion 56a is arranged in the hub 37a and is fixedly attached to the end face of the cam shaft 34 by the bolts 53 along with the hub 37a as described above. The large diameter cylindrical portion 56b is arranged proximately to an outer side face of the driven sprocket 37. In this way, the magnet holder 56 is arranged to cross a rotation center face P of the timing chain 38. A driving magnet 48A in a ring-like shape is fixed to an inner peripheral face of the large diameter cylindrical portion 56b by press - fitting or adhesion and an inner peripheral face and an outer end face of the driving magnet 48A is covered with a protection cover 58 made of synthetic resin.  <br>
The inner side housing half 41a is arranged proximately to the inner peripheral face of the driving magnet 48A to cross the rotation center face P of the timing chain 38. The inner side housing half 41a is made of synthetic resin and formed in a shape of a bottomed cylinder and the boss 45 formed at its bottom portion and projected from the outer side face, is arranged to face a space 57 surrounded by the plurality of pieces of bolts 53. Further, there is contained a driven magnet 48B fixedly attached to the pump shaft 47 at inside of the inner side housing half 41a. At this occasion, the driven magnet 48B is concentrically arranged with the driving magnet 48A by interposing the inner side housing half 41a. Two end faces and an outer peripheral face of the driven magnet 48B, are mold-coupled with a cover member 61 made of synthetic resin and the pump impeller 48 is integrally connected to one end of the cover member 61.<br><br><br>
As shown by Fig. 4, the driving and the driven magnets 58A and 58B are respectively magnetized alternately with N poles and S poles along peripheral directions and can transmit torque mutually by mutual action of magnetic force.<br>
Next, an explanation will be given of operation of the embodiment.<br><br>
In operating the engine 20, the crank shaft 29 drives to rotate the cam shaft 34 via the driving sprocket 36, the timing chain 38 and the driven sprocket 37 to thereby open and close the intake and the exhaust valves 30i and 30e. Simultaneously therewith, the driving magnet 48A integrally connected to the driven sprocket 37 via the magnet holder 56 is also rotated and accordingly, the driven magnet 48B is rotated in a direction the same as that of the driving magnet 48A by the magnetic force effected mutually by the driving magnet 48A and the driven magnet 48B to thereby drive to rotate the pump impeller 48.<br>
Meanwhile, the magnet holder 56 fixedly attached to the hub 37a of the driven sprocket 37, is provided with the large diameter cylindrical portion 56b arranged on the outer side of the driven sprocket 37 and having the diameter larger than the inner diameter of the hub 37a, the driving magnet 48A is fixed to the inner peripheral face and accordingly, not only the driving magnet 48A but also the driven magnet 58B surrounded<br><br>
thereby can be formed by sufficiently large diameters without being interfered by the driven sprocket 37 and an increase in transmission torque of these can be achieved.<br>
 Further, the magnet holder 56 for holding the driving magnet 48A and the pump housing 41, particularly, the inner side housing half 41a for supporting the driven magnet 48B, are arranged such that these cross the rotation center face P of the timing chain 38 and accordingly, the inner side space of the cylindrical hub 37a of the driven sprocket 37, constitutes a space of containing portions of the magnet holder 56 and the inner side housing half 41a and a total of the driving apparatus 55 can be restrained from enlarging in the axial direction.<br>
 Further, the hub 37a of the driven sprocket 37 and the magnet holder 56 are fixedly attached to the end face of the cam shaft 34 by the plurality of pieces of bolts 53 arranged at the surrounding of the axis line of the cam shaft 34, the boss 45 projected from the outer side face of the inner side housing half 41a for supporting the pump shaft 47, faces the space 57 surrounded by the head portions of the bolts 53 and accordingly, the inner side housing half 41a can be arranged to be as proximate as possible to the cam shaft 34 while avoiding mutual interference between the bolts 53 and the boss 45. Therefore, space efficiency of the driven sprocket 37 at inside of the hub 37a is promoted and compactness of the pump driving apparatus 55 can be achieved.<br><br>
 The invention is not limited to the above - described embodiment but the design can be changed variously without deviating from a range of the gist.  For example, the invention is applicable to driving water pumps of various vehicles other than a motorcycle and to driving fuel pumps of various vehicles including a motorcycle.<br>
