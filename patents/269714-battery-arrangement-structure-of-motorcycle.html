[Title of the Invention]  Battery Arrangement Structure of Motorcycle [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to the battery arrangement structure of a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As a motorcycle, there has been known a motorcycle which includes: a main frame which extends rearwardly and downwardly from a head pipe; a pair of left and right rear frames which is contiguously connected to a rear portion of the main frame and extends rearwardly and upwardly; a storing box which is arranged on the pair of left and right rear frames and bulges between both rear frames; and a battery storing recessed portion which is disposed in the storing box and stores a battery in a state where at least a portion of the battery projects into the inside of<br>
I  the storing box (see patent document 1). [Patent Document 1] JP-A-2006-96133 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems that the Invention is to solve] [0003]<br>
3       However, in the conventional constitution, the<br><br>
battery stored in the inside of the storing box is positioned between the pair of left and right rear frames and hence, it is impossible to provide a cross frame which connects the rear frames at a portion where the battery is present thus giving rise to a drawback that the restriction is imposed on the layout of the cross frame. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made under the above-mentioned circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide the battery airrangement structure of a motorcycle which can enhance the degree of freedom in layout of a cross frame which connescts the rear frames. [Means for Solving the Problems] [0005]<br>
I        To overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, the<br>
invention provides the battery arrangement structure of a motorcycle which includes: a main frame which extends rearwardly and downwardly from a head pipe; a pair of left and right rear frames which is connected to a rear portion<br>
)  of the main frame and extends rearwardly and upwardly; a storing box which is arranged on the main frame or the pair of left and right rear frames and has a portion which bulges between both rear frames; and a battery storing portion which is disposed in the storing box and supports 5  a battery in a state that at least a portion of the<br><br>
battery projects into the inside of the storing box, wherein the battery and the battery storing portion which stores the battery therein are arranged above the rear frames as viewed in a side view of a vehicle.<br>
According to this invention, the battery and the battery storing portion which stores the battery therein are arranged above the rear frames as viewed in a side view of the vehicle and hence, the battery and the battery storing portion can be removed from a space between the rear frames whereby it is possible to enhance the degree of freedom in layout of the cross frame in providing the cross frame which connects the reai: frames. [0006]<br>
In the above-mentioned constitution, the battery may<br>
I      be provided in an inclined manner along the inclination of the rear frames which extend rearwardly and upwardly as viewed in a side view of the vehicle, and a portion of the battery may project into the inside of the storing box in an inclined state.  Due to such a constitution, the<br>
)  battery can be arranged closer to the rear frames and<br>
hence, a projection amount of the battery into the inside of the storing box can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the arrangement of the battery closer to the rear frames whereby the space taken up by the battery<br>
3  in the inside of the storing box can be reduced.<br><br>
In the above-mentioned constitution, the battery storing portion may be arranged on a rear side of the storing box, and may support the battery in a state that an upper surface of the battery is inclined frontwardly and downwardly.  Due to such a constitution, the battery can be easily mounted on and removed from the battery storing portion arranged on a rear side of the storing box [0007]<br>
In the above-mentioned constitution, a fuel tank may be arranged behind the storing box, and a rear portion of the battery may be positioned in a space surrounded by a rear wall of the storing box, a front portion of the fuel tank and the rear frames.  Due to such a constitution, a space defined by the storing box, the fuel tank and the rear frames can be effectively utilized as a layout space for the battery.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned constitution, the battery may have the longitudinal direction thereof arranged along the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and a helmet may be stored in the inside of the storing box in a state that the helmet covers the portion of the battery which projects into the inside of the storing box from, above.  Due to such a constitution, it is possible to ensure a relatively large storing space on left and right sides of the battery in the inside of the storing box thus<br><br>
avoiding the large-sizing of the storing box in the vehicle-width direction while allov^/ing the storing of the helmet. [0008]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned constitution, the battery may be arranged in the inside of the storing box in an inclined manner as viewed in a side view of the vehicle, and a profile projection plane which is obtained by projecting a profile of the battery in the direction orthogonal to an upper surface or a bottom surface of the battery may pass through the inside of an opening brim of the storing box.  Due to such a constitution, the opening brim, of the storing box does not become an obstacle at the time of storing or removing the battery thus facilitating<br>
1  a storing and removing operation of the battery.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned constitution, a cross frame may extend between front portions of the pair of left and right rear frames.  Due to such a constitution, the cross frame can be arranged closer to a front side of<br>
)  the vehicle and hence, it is possible to ensure a layout space for vehicle constitutional parts between the rear fram.es or to widen a vacant space between the rear frames by an amount corresponding to the closer arrangement of the cross frame to the front side of the vehicle.  For<br>
3  exam.ple, it is possible to arrange a rear fender closer to<br>
4<br><br>
a front side of the vehicle. [Advantage of the Invention] [0009]<br>
According to this invention, the battery and the battery storing portion which stores the battery therein are arranged above the rear frames as viewed in a side view of the vehicle and hence, it is possible to enhance the degree of freedom in the layout of the cross frame which connects the rear frames.<br>
Further, the battery is provided in an inclined manner along the inclination of the rear frames which extend rearwardly and upwardly as viewed in a side view of the vehicle, and the portion of the battery projects into the inside of the storing box in an inclined state and hence, the projection amount of the battery into the inside of the storing box can be reduced whereby the space taken up by the battery in the inside of the storing box can be reduced.<br>
Further, the battery storing portion is arranged on the rear side of the storing box, and supports the battery in a state that the upper surface of the battery is inclined frontwardly and downwardly and hence, the battery can be easily mounted on and removed from the battery storing portion arranged on a rear side of the storing box<br>
Further, the fuel tanlc is arranged behind the<br><br>
)<br><br>
storing box, and the rear portion of the battery is positioned in the space surrounded by the rear wall of the storing box, the front portion of "che fuel tank and the rear frames and hence, the space defined by the storing box, the fuel tank and the rear frames can be effectively utilized as a layout space for the battery.<br>
Further, the battery has the longitudinal direction thereof arranged along the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and the helmet is stored in the inside of the storing box in a state that the helmet covers the portion of the battery which projects into the inside of the storing box from above and hence, it is possible to avoid the large-sizing of the storing box in the vehicle-width direction while allowing the storing of the helmet.<br>
The battery is arranged in the inside of the storing box in an inclined manner as viewed in a side view of the vehicle, and the profile projection plane which is obtained by projecting a profile of the battery in the direction orthogonal to an upper surface or a bottom surface of the battery passes through the inside of an opening brim of the storing box and hence, the opening brim of the storing box does not become the obstacle at the time of storing or removing the battery thus facilitating the storing and removing operation of the battery.<br><br>
*^8-<br><br>
Further, the cross frame extends between front portions of the pair of left and right rear frames and hence,  it is possible to ensure a layout space for vehicle constitutional parts between the rear frames or to widen a vacant space between the rear frames by an amount corresponding to the closer arrangement of the cross frame to the front side of the vehicle. [Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention] [0010]<br>
Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention is explained in conjunction with attached drawings.<br>
Here, in the explanation made hereinafter, the directions of "front", "rear", "left", "right", "up" and "down" are directions as viewed from a rider of a vehicle. Further, in the drawings, an arrow F indicates a front side of the vehicle, an arrow L indicates a left side of the vehicle, and an arrow U indicates an upper side of the vehicle respectively.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the motorcycle 1.  The motorcycle 1 includes a vehicle-body frame 2, a steering handle 10 which is arranged on an upper portion of a front portion of the vehicle in a state that the steering handle 10 is rotatably supported on a head pipe 3 of the vehicle-body<br><br>
frame 2,   a pair of left and right front forks 11 which is rotatably supported on the head pipe 3 of the vehicle-body frame 2, a front wheel 12 v&gt;7hich is rotatably supported on the front forks 11, rear forks 14 which are vertically swingably supported on a pivot shaft 13 which is supported on a rear lower portion of the vehicle-body frame 2, a rear wheel 15 which is rotatably supported on rear end portions of the rear forks 14, a pair of left and right rear cushions 16, 16 each of which is arranged between the rear forks 14 and the vehicle-body frame 2, an engine (also referred to as a power unit) 20 which is supported on the vehicle-body frame 2 using support brackets 17, 17 and the like, a fuel tank 50 which is supported on a rear upper portion of the vehicle-body frame 2, a storing box (also referred to as a storing portion) 51 which is supported on the vehicle-body frame 2, a rider's seat 52 which is supported on the storing box 51 and the fuel tank 50 in an openable and closeable manner, and a grab rail 53 which is arranged behind the rider's seat 52. Here, the<br>
I  rider's seat 52 is a longitudinally-elongated integral-type seat in which a front seat on which a rider sits and a rear seat on which a pillion sits are formed as an integral body. [0011]<br>
3        The engine 20 is a single-cylinder 4-cycle engine.<br>
lO<br><br>
The engine 20 is constituted of a horizontal engine which has a cylinder portion 22 thereof largely frontwardly inclined from a front surface of a crankcase 24 to a state in which the cylinder portion 22 assumes an approximately horizontal state.  Due to such a constitution, it is possible to lower the center of gravity of the vehicle and, at the same time, it is possible to lower the main frame 4 as shown in the drawing so as to lower a straddle portion M over which a rider strides at the time of riding the vehicle thus enhancing the easiness of getting on-and-off property.<br>
An intake pipe 2 6 is connected to an upper portion of the cylinder portion 22 of the engine 20, and the intake pipe 26 extends in the upward direction, and is connected to an air cleaner 28 which is supported on a throttle body 27 and the main frame 4. An exhaust pipe 29 is connected to a lower portion of the cylinder portion 22, the exhaust pipe 29 extends downwardly, is bent thereafter, extends in the rearward direction, and is connected to a muffler 30 which is arranged on a right side of the rear wheel 15.<br>
Further, an output shaft 31 of the engine 20 is pivotally supported on a rear portion of a left surface of the crankcase 24 in a state that a distal end portion of the output shaft 31 is exposed to the outside. A drive<br>
I<br><br>
sprocket wheel 32 is mounted on the distal end of the output shaft 31, and a power transmitting chain 34 is wound around the drive sprocket wheel 32 and a driven sprocket wheel 33 which is integrally mounted on the rear wheel 15 thus constituting a chain-power-transmitting mechanism.  Due to such a constitution, the rotation of the output shaft 31 of the engine 20 is transmitted to the rear wheel 15 by way of the chain-power-transmitting mechanism.  Further, in Fig. 1, numeral 35 indicates a cover for covering the chain-power-transmitting mechanism, and numeral 39 indicates a starter motor for starting the engine. [0012]<br>
Further, the motorcycle 1 is covered with a synthetic-resin-made vehicle-body cover 18.  The vehicle-body cover 18 roughly includes a front cover 18A which covers a front portion of the vehicle (an area around the head pipe 3), a pair of left and right leg shields 18B which is connected to the front cover 18A and covers a leg<br>
I  portion of the rider from a front side, a center cover 18C which covers a center portion of the vehicle-body frame 2 including both sides of the vehicle-body frame 2, and a pair of left and right rear covers 18D which covers a rear portion of the vehicle from both sides of the vehicle.<br>
)  Further, a rear fender 18E which covers the rear wheel 15<br>
la.<br><br>
from above is mounted on inner sides of the pair of left and right rear covers 18D.  Further, in Fig. 1, numeral 18G indicates a front fender (also shown in Fig. 3 described later) which covers the front wheel 12 from above, and numeral 18H indicates a handle cover which covers parts around the handle 10 and also mounts a headlight thereon.  Further, in Fig. 2, a foot-rest step 36 for a rider and a foot-rest step 37 for a pillion are shown. [0013]<br>
Fig. 3 is a side view showing the vehicle-body frame 2 together with the constitution around the vehicle-body frame 2, Fig. 4 is a top plan view of the vehicle body frame, and Fig. 5 is a back view of the vehicle body frame<br>
)  As shown in Fig. 3 to Fig. 5, the vehicle-body frame 2 of the motorcycle 1 includes one main frame 4 which extends in an inclined manner in the oblique rearward and downward direction from the head pipe 3 which is arranged on a front side of the vehicle, a pair of left and right pivot<br>
3  brackets 5, 5 which is fixedly mounted on a rear portion of the main frame 4 in a downwardly extending manner, and a pair of left and right rear frames 6, 6 which is contiguously mounted on the rear portion of the main frame 4 in rearwardly and upwardly extending manner. 5        The pair of left and right rear frames 6, 6 includes<br>
13<br><br>
a pair of left and right first rear frames 1,   7 vjhich extends obliquely and upwardly from a rear side of the pivot brackets b,   5 of the main frame 4 and, thereafter, extends horizontally toward a rear side of the vehicle, and functions as seat rails which support the rider's seat 52 and the like, and a pair of left and right second rear frames 8, 8 which extends toward a rear side of the vehicle from a front side of the pivot brackets 5, 5 of the main frame 4, is connected to the first rear frames 7, 7 and functions as sub frames (reinforcing frames). As shown in Fig. 3, these frames 4, 7 and 8 form the triangular truss structure and hence, the rear frames 6, 6 can ensure the sufficient frame rigidity. [0014]<br>
)        To explain the frames 7, 8 in detail, with respect to the first rear frames 7, 7, main frame parts of the first rear frames 7, 7 are formed from pipe frames, wherein a pair of left and right plate-shaped reinforcing frames 7B, 7B which constitutes reinforcing members is<br>
]  connected to the left and right pipe frames while<br>
extending over the left and right bent portions 7A, 7A in the longitudinal direction, and a cross-frame 7C is arranged between the frames 7, 7.<br>
Further, the cross frame 7C is constituted of an 5  intermediate cross frame 7C1 which connects portions of<br>
14<br><br>
the first rear frames 7, 7 in the vicinity of the bent portions 7A, 7A which correspond to intermediate portions of the first rear frames 1,   1,   and a rear cross frame 7C2 which connects rear portions of the first rear frames 7, 7. Here, the intermediate cross frame 7C1 is formed of a pipe member which penetrates the first rear frames 7, 7 and extends to the outside of the vehicle.  The intermediate cross frame 7C1 is configured to support upper end portions of the rear cushions 16, 16 on extending portions thereof thus also functioning as a support member of the rear cushions 16, 16.  Further, on the rear cross frame 7C2, a plate member 7C2A to which a support plate 53A of the grab rail 53 is integrally connected and a plate member 7C2B which also functions as a support stay of the rear fender 18E are mounted.  In the drawing, numerals 7D, 7D indicate a pair of left and right cover stays for mounting the pair of left and right rear covers 18D. [0015]<br>
Further, the second rear frames 8, 8 are constituted of pipe frames which extend in the rearward and upward direction at a gentle angle closer to a horizontal plane than the first rear frames 7, 7. Rear portions of the second rear frames 8, 8 are connected to substantially intermediate portions of portions of the first rear frames 7, 7 which extend in the rearward and upward direction and.<br><br>
at the same time, a pipe-shaped cross frame 8A is mounted on portions of the second rear fram.es 8, 8 which are arranged in front of the connection portions in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.<br>
That is, the cross frame 8A extending between the second rear frames 8, 8 and the cross frames 7C (intermediate cross frame 7C1, rear cross frame 7C2) extending between the first rear frames 7, 7 constitute cross frames which respectively connect the front portions, the intermediate portions, and the rear portions of the rear frames 6, 6 thus enabling a layout of cross frames advantageous for ensuring the rigidity of the rear frames 6, 6 as a whole.  Further, a front end portion of the rear fender 18E is suspended from the cross frame 8A.  In Fig. 5, numeral 5A indicates a pipe-shaped cross frame which is arranged between the pivot brackets 5, 5. [0016]<br>
In the constitution of this embodiment, a pair of left and right storing box support stays SB, 8B which supports a rear portion of the storing box 51 is mounted on the second rear frames 8, 8 of the rear frames 6, 6 in the vicinity of the cross frame BA, and a single storing box support stay 4F which supports a front portion of the storing box 51 is mounted on the main frame 4 in the vicinity of the rear frames 6, 6 (for example, see Fig. 4).<br>
i6<br><br>
The storing box 51 is connected to the above-mentioned stays 8B, 8B, 4F using bolts 42 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 6) and nuts 43 (see Fig. 6) by way of a vibration-isolating mount rubber 40 (see Fig. 6 described later) and a washer 41 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 6).  Due to such a constitution, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the storing box 51 is supported on the vehicle-body frame 2 at a substantially intermediate position in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle by three-point supporting and is arranged above the rear frames 6, 6.<br>
Further, on left and right sides of the second rear frames 8, 8 (outer sides of the vehicle) in the vicinity of the cross frame 8A, a support stay 8C for supporting a regulator which constitutes a part of an engine drive system, and an ECU support stay 8D for supporting an electronic control unit (ECU) which controls the respective parts of the motorcycle 1 are integrally formed, That is, vehicle-body constitutional parts are supported on a portion of the frame which exhibits relatively high frame strength in a concentrated manner. [0017]<br>
Further, in the vicinity of the rear portions of the second rear frames 8, 8, that is, in the vicinity of portions of the second rear frames 8, 8 where the second )  rear frames 8, 8 and the first rear frames 7, 7 are<br>
1?<br><br>
connected with each other, a pair of left and right fuel tank support stays 8E, 8E which supports the fuel tank 50 is integrally formed.  Due to such a constitution, the fuel tank 50 is also supported on the portions of the second rear frames 8, 8 which exhibit relatively high frame strength.  Here, in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, numeral SOP indicates a fuel pump which is arranged in the inside of a front space of the fuel tank 50. [0018]<br>
Here, in arranging the storing box 51 in the above-mentioned manner, in general, the storing box 51 is bulged in a space between the left and right rear frames 6, 6 so as to ensure broad storing capacity. Due to such a constitution, a user or the like can store a helmet which is a large-sized part to be stored and a rider or the like wants to store in the storing box 51.<br>
On the other hand, this type of motorcycle 1 includes a battery 55 which supplies electricity to various kinds of electric equipment (electronic control device, regulator and the like) which are mounted on the vehicle.  In this constitution, as shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, the battery 55 is arranged in the inside of the storing box 51.  In general, when the battery 55 is arranged in the inside of the storing box 51, such battery arrangement can make use of the water-proof structure of the storing<br>
*t<br><br>
box 51 per se compared to a case where the battery 55 is arranged at a place other than the storing box 51. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect that the water-proof structure of a battery storing part 71 described later which stores the battery 55 therein can be omitted or simplified.  However, this battery arrangement has a drawback that the storing capacity of the storing box is decreased by an amount corresponding to such arrangement of the battery 55.<br>
To allow the storing box 51 to ensure a sufficient storing capacity while arranging the battery 55 therein, it may be possible to adopt a method which ensures the storing capacity of the storing box 51 by simply bulging the battery 55 between both rear frames 6, 6.  However, in this case, a cross frame which connects the left and right rear frames 6, 6 cannot be mounted on a portion where the battery 55 is arranged and hence, the layout of the cross frame is restricted.<br>
In view of the above, this em^bodiment provides the constitution which can ensure a storing capacity capable of storing a helmet while enhancing the degree of freedom in the layout of the cross frame. Hereinafter, the storing box is explained together with the battery arrangement structure. [0019]<br>
^1^<br><br>
Fig. 6 is a side vievj of the storing box 51, Fig. 7 is a top plan view of the storing box 51, and Fig. 8 is a back view of the storing box 51. Here, in the respective drawings, numeral 60 indicates a plurality of (three) bolt insertion holes which is used in mounting the storing box 51 on the main frame 4 (stays 8B, 8B and 4F) by fastening using bolts.<br>
The storing box 51 has a box shape which opens upwardly. A support arm portion 61 which projects frontwardly is integrally mounted on a center portion of a front upper portion of a front wall 51A of the storing box 51 in a projecting manner, and a front end of the rider's seat 52 is rotatably connected to the storing box 51 by way of a shaft which is inserted into a shaft insertion hole 62 formed in the support arm portion 61.  Due to such a constitution, the rider's seat 52 can be rotated so as to open or close the upper opening of the storing box 51. Further, the rider's seat 52 can be locked to assume a locked state by a locking mechanism not shown in the drawing.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the front wall 51A of the storing box 51 extends to a position in the vicinity of the main frame 4 of the vehicle-body frame 2 in a state that the front wall 51A is supported on the vehicle-body frame 2. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, a bottom wall 51B<br>

of the storing box 51 includes a front bottom wall 51B1 which extends in the rearward and downward direction along the inclination of the main frame 4 from a lower edge of the front wall 51A, and a rear bottom wall 51B3 which extends in the rearward and upward direction substantially along the inclination of the second rear frames 8, 8 from a position above and in the vicinity of the second rear frames 8, 8 by way of a vertical wall 51B2 which extends vertically in the upward direction from a rear edge of the front bottom wall 51B1. [0020]<br>
That is, a front-side portion (a storing part corresponding to the front bottom wall 51B1) of the storing box 51 forms a bulging portion 63 which extends in the downward direction between the second rear frames 8, 8 and is arranged at a position in the vicinity of the main frame 4 thus constituting a deepest portion of the storing box 51. As shown in Fig. 1, the bulging portion 63 is formed into a shape having a longitudinal length, a depth and a width which allows the bulging portion 63 to store a front side (a visor-lOl-side portion) of a half-type helmet 100 when the helmet 100 is inserted into the storing box 51 in a state that the visor 101 side of the helmet 100 is directed in the downward direction.<br>
Further, a rib (rib for positioning storing parts)<br>
21<br><br>
64 which projects upwardly is formed on a bottom (front bottom wall 51B1) of the bulging portion 63 in a state that the rib 64 is arranged in front of the vertical wall 51B2 in a spaced apart manner from the vertical wall 51B2. Water drain holes 65, 66 are also formed in the bottom of the bulging portion 63 in front of and behind the rib 64 respectively.  The rib 64 is integrally formed on the bottom of the bulging portion 63 preliminarily at a position where the visor 101 of the helmet 100 is brought into contact with the rib 64 so that a storing position of the helmet 100 is determined. [0021]<br>
The battery storing portion 71 which stores the battery 55 therein is mounted on a rear-side portion of the storing box 51, and a battery cover 81 which covers the battery 55 stored in the battery storing portion 71 from above is detachably mounted on the battery storing portion 71. First of all, the battery storing portion 71 is explained in detail.<br>
'       As shown in Fig. 6, on a center portion of the rear-side bottom wall 51B3 of the storing box 51, as viewed in a side view, a V-shaped bottom cross-sectional shape made of a first inclined surface 72 which extends rearwardly and downwardly from an upper end of the vertical wall 51B2<br>
5  and a second inclined surface 73 which extends rearwardly<br>
2J-<br><br>
and upwardly from a rear lower portion of the first inclined surface 72 is formed.  Due to such a constitution, as shown in the drawing, a battery storing recessed portion (battery front-portion storing portion) 75 which stores a front portion of the battery 55 therein is formed. Further, a hole 75A which is used for wiring lines or draining water is formed in a deepest portion of the battery storing recessed portion 75. [0022]<br>
Further, on a rear wall 51C of the storing box 51, a battery storing projecting portion (battery rear-portion storing portion) 76 which projects toward a rear side of the vehicle and stores a rear portion of the battery 55 therein is formed.  In the battery storing projecting portion 76, a third inclined surface 77 which is contiguously connected with the second inclined surface 73 of the battery storing recessed portion 75 is formed and, at the same time, a fourth inclined surface 78 which is a frontward and upward inclined surface extending in the<br>
I  direction perpendicular to the third inclined surface 77 (approximately parallel to the first inclined surface 72) from a rear edge of the third inclined surface 77 is formed.<br>
Here, the battery storing projecting portion 76 is<br>
:  constituted as a part separate from the storing box 51.<br>
2j<br><br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 8, an opening portion 67 is formed in the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51, the battery storing projecting portion 76 is brought into contact with the storing box 51 so as to close the opening portion 67, and the battery storing projecting portion 76 is connected to the storing box 51 by screws or the like using a plurality of holes 68 formed in a periphery of the opening portion 67.  Here, Fig. 7 also shows a state in which the battery storing projecting portion 76 is removed as in Fig. 8. [0023]<br>
The battery 55 stored in the battery storing portion 71 has a rectangular parallelepiped shape in the same manner as a general battery. The battery storing portion 71 is configured to store the battery 55 with a layout in which the longitudinal direction of a horizontal cross section of the battery 55 when the battery 55 is arranged horizontally is aligned with the longitudinal direction of the vehicle (vertical mounting layout).  That is, as shown in Fig. 6 and 7, in expressing a longitudinal size of the horizontal cross section of the battery 55 as a value BL and a lateral size of the horizontal cross section of the battery 55 as a value BH, a spaced-apart distance of the battery storing portion 71 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle is slightly larger than the value BL (see<br><br>
Fig. 6), and a spaced-apart distance of the battery storing portion 71 in the vehicle width direction is set slightly larger than the value BH (see Fig. 7).<br>
In this manner, by arranging the battery 55 in accordance with the layout which vertically mounts the battery 55 at the center in the vehicle width direction, it is possible to ensure a relatively large storing space on left and right sides of the battery 55 in the storing box 51 and, at the same time, the battery 55 having relatively large weight can be arranged at the center in the vehicle width direction and hence, it is possible to easily set a position of the center of gravity of the vehicle at the center in the vehicle width direction. Further, due to the vertical storing of the battery 55, it is possible to arrange support portions (bolt insertion holes 60 and the like) on sides of the battery 55 and hence, it is possible to arrange the support portions in the vicinity of the battery 55 which is an heavy object without increasing the width of the storing box 51. [0024]<br>
Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 1, it is possible to store a portion of the battery 55 which projects into the inside of the storing box 51 in an inner space of the helmet 100 (space in which the head goes), and it is possible to store portions on both sides of the helmet 100<br><br>
into spaces formed on left and right sides of the battery 55.  That is, the helmet 100 can be efficiently stored in the inside of the storing box 51.<br>
An opening brim 51X of the storing box 51 is inclined frontwardly and downwardly as viewed in a side view of the vehicle. Due to such a constitution, a portion of the helmet 100 in the storing box 51 is exposed to the outside of the opening brim 51X, and the exposed portion of the helmet 100 is covered with the rider's seat 52 (see Fig. 1). Accordingly, the portion of the helmet 100 is exposed when the rider's seat 52 is opened and hence, a rider can easily take out or store the helmet 100 by gripping the exposed portion of the helmet 100 with his/her hand.  Further, in storing the battery 55 in the<br>
i  storing box 51 or removing the battery 55 from the storing box 51, by storing or removing the battery 55 from a front side of the storing box 51, it is possible to decrease vertical moving quantity of the storing box 51 thus facilitating the storing and removing operation of the<br>
3  battery 55. [0025]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 6, an inclination angle 6 of the battery 55 is set to an angle equal to or more than 90 degrees (that is, an obtuse angle) with respect to the<br>
5  rear wall 51C (vertical wall) of the storing box 51 as<br><br>
viewed in a side view of the vehicle.  Due to such setting of the inclination angle 8, a rear lower portion of the battery 55 projects toward the outside of the storing box 51.  In this layout, as shown in Fig. 3, it is possible to effectively utilize an approximately triangular space surrounded by the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51, a front portion 50A of the fuel tank 50 which is inclined obliquely in the rearward and downward direction, and the rear frames 6, 6 as a layout space of the battery 55. Further, in removing the battery 55 from the storing box 51, the battery 55 is removed in the direction away from the rear wall 51C and hence, the removal of the battery 55 is facilitated.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 6, a profile projection surface 55X which is obtained by projecting a profile of the battery 55 in the direction orthogonal to an upper surface or a bottom surface of the battery 55 passes through the inside of the opening brim 51X of the storing box 51 and hence, the opening brim 51X does not become an obstacle at the time of storing or removing the battery 55 thus further facilitating the storing and removing operation of the battery 55. [0026]<br>
Next, the battery cover 81 is explained.  Fig. 9 is a perspective view of the battery cover 81.  The battery<br>
2^<br><br>
cover 81 is a cover vjhich covers the projecting portion of the battery 55 which is stored in the battery storing portion 71 and projects into the inside of the storing box 51.  The battery cover 81 includes a first cover portion 81A which is contiguously connected v;ith the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51, and a second cover portion 81B which bulges from the first cover portion 81A and has a shape which approximately conforms to a profile of the projecting portion of the battery 55.<br>
On an upper portion of the first cover portion 81A, an engaging pawl 82 which is engaged with an opening portion (engaging hole) 69A which is formed in the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51 (see Fig. 6), and a screw fastening portion 83 for fastening the first cover portion<br>
I      81A to the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51 by<br>
threadedly engaging a screw with a screw hole 69B formed in the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51 (see Fig. 6) are integrally formed.  Further, on a front lower portion of the second cover portion 81B which is remotest from the<br>
)  above-mentioned engaging pawl 82, a pair of left and right engaging pawls 84, 84 which is inserted into a pair of left and right opening portions (engaging holes) 69C, 69C formed in the rear-side bottom wall 51B3 of the storing box 51 (see Fig. 7) is integrally formed.<br>
5   [0027]<br>
^<br><br>
Due to such a constitution, in mounting the battery cover 81 in the storing box 51, when the pair of left and right engaging pawls 84, 84 of the battery cover 81 is inserted into the pair of left and right opening portions 69C, 69C formed in the rear-side bottom wall 51B3 of the storing box 51, and the battery cover 81 is rotated toward the rear-wall-51C side of the storing box 51 using such insertion portions as the reference, the engaging pawl 82 of the battery cover 81 is engaged with the opening portion 69A formed in the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51. Due to such engagement, it is possible to easily perform temporally fastening of the battery cover 81 to the storing box 51.  Then, when the screw fastening portion 83 of the battery cover 81 is fastened to the storing box 51 by threadedly engaging the screw with the threaded hole 69B of the storing box 51, the battery cover 81 is surely fixed to the storing box 51. Accordingly, it is possible to easily perform the storing and removing operation of the battery cover 81.<br>
Since the battery 55 is covered with the battery cover 81 from above in this manner, it is possible to prevent electrode parts or lines which are exposed on an upper surface of the battery 55 from being exposed to the outside. )        Further, recessed portions 86, 87 formed in an upper<br><br>
surface and a front surface of the second cover portion 81B of the battery cover 81 respectively are brought into contact with an upper surface and a front surface of the battery 55 respectively thus pushing the battery 55 toward the battery storing portion 71 side. Accordingly, it is possible to surely support the battery 55 on the battery storing portion 71 thus preventing the positional displacement of the battery 55. [0028]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, the battery 55 and the battery storing portion 71 which stores the battery 55 therein are arranged above the rear frames 6 (upper side of the rear frames 6 when the rear frames 6 are used as the reference) as viewed in a side<br>
I      view of a vehicle and hence, even when the battery 55 is stored in a state that at least a pjortion of the battery 55 projects into the inside of the storing box 51, the battery 55 and the battery storing portion 71 can be removed from a space between the rear frames 6, 6 whereby<br>
)  it is possible to enhance the degree of freedom in layout of the cross frame 8A in providing the cross frame 8A which connects the rear frames 6, 6.  For example, the position of the cross frame 8A shown in Fig. 3 can be changed in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.<br>
5  Further, as in the case of the embodiment, the cross frame<br>
3^<br><br>
8A can be arranged below the battery 55. Accordingly, it is possible to enhance the degree of freedom in adjusting the rigidity balance of the vehicle-body frame 2.<br>
In addition, the battery 55 and the battery storing portion 71 are arranged at a position different from a position where the bulging portion 63 of the storing box 51 which bulges between the pair of left and right rear frames 6, 6 is arranged and hence, the bulging portion 63 can be miniaturized and, at the same time, the space in which the battery 55, the battery storing portion 71 and the storing box 51 are not present can be surely ensured between the rear frames 6, 6 thus surely ensuring a layout space for the cross frame 8A which connects the rear frames 6, 6.<br>
Further, the battery 55 is provided in an inclined manner along the inclination of the rear frames 6, 6 which extend rearwardly and upwardly as viewed in a side view of the vehicle, and a portion of the battery 55 is projected into the inside of the storing box 51 in an inclined state and hence, the battery 55 can be arranged closer to the rear frames 6, 6. Accordingly, a projection amount of the battery 55 into the inside of the storing box 51 can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the arrangement of the battery 55 closer to the rear frames 6, 6 and hence, a space taken up by the battery in the inside of the storing<br>
31<br><br>
box 51 can be reduced. [0029]<br>
Further, the battery storing portion 71 is arranged on a rear side of the storing box 51, and supports the battery 55 in a state that an upper surface of the battery 55 is inclined frontwardly and downwardly and hence, the battery 55 can be easily stored in and removed from the battery storing portion 71 which is arranged on a rear side of the storing box 51.<br>
The fuel tank 50 is arranged behind the storing box 51, and the rear portion of the battery 55 is positioned in the space surrounded by the rear wall 51C of the storing box 51, the front portion 50A of the fuel tank 50 and the rear frames 6, 6 and hence, the space defined by the storing box 51, the fuel tank 50 and the rear frames 6, 6 can be effectively utilized as a layout space for the battery 55. Also due to such a constitution, the space taken up by the battery in the inside of the storing box 51 can be reduced.<br>
)        Further, the battery 55 has the longitudinal direction thereof arranged along the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and the helmet 100 is stored in the inside of the storing box 51 in a state that the helmet 100 covers the portion of the battery 55 which<br>
3  projects into the inside of the storing box 51 from above<br>
33L<br><br>
and hence, it is possible to ensure a relatively large storing space on left and right sides of the battery 55 in the inside of the storing box 51 thus avoiding the large-sizing of the storing box 51 in the vehicle-width direction while allowing the storing of the helmet 100. [0030]<br>
The battery 55 is arranged in the inside of the storing box 51 in an inclined manner as viewed in a side view of the vehicle, and the profile projection plane 55X which is obtained by projecting a profile of the battery 55 in the direction orthogonal to an upper surface or a bottom surface of the battery 55 passes through the inside of the opening brim 51X of the storing box 51 and hence, the opening brim 51X of the storing box 51 does not become an obstacle at the time of storing or removing the battery 55 thus facilitating a storing and removing operation of the battery 55.<br>
Further, the cross frame 8A extends between front portions of the pair of left and right rear frames 6, 6,<br>
I  and the storing box 51 is supported on the rear frames 6, 6 at a position in the vicinity of the cross frame 8A. Accordingly, the cross frame 8A can. be arranged closer to a front side of the vehicle and hence, it is possible to ensure a layout space for vehicle constitutional parts<br>
'■&gt;      between the rear frames 6, 6 or to widen a vacant space<br>
33<br><br>
3<br><br>
between the rear frames 6, 6 by an amount corresponding to the closer arrangement of the cross frame 8A to the front side of the vehicle.<br>
In the constitution of this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the space which is formed behind the cross frame 8A by mounting the cross frame 8A on front portions of the rear frames 6, 6 is utilized as the layout space for the rear fender 18E. Accordingly, it is possible to arrange the rear fender 18E closer to the front side of the vehicle.  Due to such arrangement of the rear fender IBE, the rear wheel 15 can be also arranged closer to the front side of the vehicle compared to the conventional constitution.  That is, a distance (wheel base) between the front axle and a rear axle can be shortened or a longitudinal length of the vehicle can be shortened. Further, the storing box 51 is supported on the rear frames 6, 6 at a position in the vicinity of the cross frame 8A and hence, it is possible to strongly support the storing box 51. [0031]<br>
Although the present invention is explained in conjunction with one embodiment heretofore, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment and various modifications in design are conceivable.  For example, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the<br><br>
34-<br><br>
explanation is made with respect to a case in which the pair of left and right rear frames 6, 6 is constituted of the first rear frames (seat rails) 1,   7 and the second rear frames (sub frames) 8, 8 which are arranged above the front portions of the first rear frames 7, 7.  However, the present invention is not limited to such a constitution, and the layout of these frames 7, 8 may be changed when necessary, and the rear frames 6, 6 may be formed of a left and right single frame which are constituted of only seat rails.  Further, the present invention is applicable not only to the vehicle-body frame 2 which includes one main frame 4 but also to a vehicle-body frame which includes a pair of left and right main frames.  In the above-mentioned embodiment, the explanation is made with respect to the case in which the storing box 51 is arranged above the main frame 4 and the pair of left and right rear frames 6, 6.  However, the present invention is not limited to such a constitution, and is applicable to a case in which the storing box 51 is not arranged above the main frame 4 but is arranged above the rear frames 6, 6 depending on the frame constitution.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the explanation is made with respect to the case in which the present invention is applied to the battery arrangement j  structure of the motorcycle which includes a single-<br>
35<br><br>
cylinder engine.  However, the present invention is not limited to such a case, and is widely applicable to the battery arrangement structure of other motorcycle. [Brief Description of the Drawings] [0032] [Fig. 1]<br>
