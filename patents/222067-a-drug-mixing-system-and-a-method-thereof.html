DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 1A, IB, 1C, ID, IE, IF, 1G, 1H, II, U, IK, 1L and 1M which are simplified pictorial illustrations of various stages of assembly and typical use of a drug mixing system constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1A, a conventional vial 10, including a top portion 12 and a neck portion 13, is pushed into engagement with a vial adaptor assembly 30 which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 4 - 6B. Top portion 12 of vial 10 preferably has a septum 31 sealingly seated therein. Figs. 18A - 18B show a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
Alternatively, if a small vial 32 is used, small vial 32 is pushed into engagement with a vial head adaptor element 34 which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 2 - 3 as shown in Fig. IB, and is then pushed into engagement with vial adaptor assembly 30. The vials 10 and 32 typically contain a drug in a soluble powder form, in a solution or in other suitable form.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1C, a luer fitted hypodermic syringe 40 having a plunger 42 and a luer tip 44 is attached to a syringe adaptor element 50 which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 7 - 9B. Figs. 19A - 19D show planar and sectional views of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
Fig. ID shows a spike port adaptor element 60, as described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 10 - 11, being inserted into a spike port 61 in a receptacle 62 containing a fluid. Fig. 20 shows a partially pictorial partially sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage. Typically, receptacle 62 comprises a bag, and the fluid contained therein is sterile saline solution, water, or any other suitable sterile solution or pure fluid.<br>
Alternatively, a needle port adaptor element 70, as described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 12A - 13B, is inserted into a needle port 64 in receptacle 62. Fig. 21 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the assembly steps shown in Figs. IB - ID may be performed in any suitable sequence.<br>
18<br><br>
As seen in Fig. IE, syringe adaptor element 50, having syringe 40 attached thereto (Fig. IC), is connected to a connection port in either of spike port adaptor element 60 or needle port adaptor element 70 of Fig. ID. Figs. 22 - 23 and 24 - 25, respectively, show partially pictorial partially sectional views of the two alternate orientations of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
Typically, plunger 42 of syringe 40 is fully pushed inward into syringe 40 before syringe adaptor element 50 is connected to either of spike port adaptor element 60 and needle port adaptor element 70.<br>
As seen in Fig. IF, a user retracts plunger 42 in either of the operative orientations of Fig. IE, thus at least partially filling syringe 40 with fluid drawn from receptacle 62. The fluid flows through the spike port adaptor element 60 or through the needle port adaptor element 70 directly into syringe 40. This flow of fluid ensures that the fluid remains sterile, and that the user is not exposed to the fluid. Subsequently, the syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 are disconnected from the spike port adaptor element 60 or the needle port adaptor element 70. The drug mixing system of the present invention also ensures that the user is not exposed to the fluid during disconnection thereof, as explained further hereinbelow.<br>
The user then connects syringe adaptor element 50, which is attached to syringe 40, to the vial adaptor assembly 30 having the vial 10 attached thereto, as shown in Fig. 1G. Fig. 26 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
When the syringe 40 and vial 10 are connected and fluid can flow therebetween, the user pushes plunger 42 inward, with the vial positioned upright, thus injecting the fluid contained in syringe 40 into vial 10 and dissolving the drag contained therein. Fig. 27 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1H, the user then shakes the drug mixing system of Fig. 1G to ensure that the drug in vial 10 is fully dissolved and that the resulting solution is homogenous.<br>
It is appreciated that when vial 10 contains a drug in a pre-dissolved form, the steps described hereinabove with reference to Figs. 1E-1H may be obviated.<br>
As seen in Fig. II, the user turns the drug mixing system upside down and retracts plunger 42, thus drawing at least part of the solution from the vial 10 into syringe 40. Subsequently, syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 are disconnected<br>
19<br><br>
from vial 10 and vial adaptor assembly 30, as shown in Fig. 1 J. At this stage, if some of the drug solution is left in vial 10, vial 10 and vial adaptor assembly 30, joined thereto, may be stored in a suitable facility for further use.<br>
At a next stage, the drug solution contained in syringe 40 is prepared for delivery to a hospital ward for infusion into a patient. As shown in Fig. IK, syringe 40 containing the drug solution is connected to spike port adaptor element 60 for transferring the drug into receptacle 62. Alternatively, syringe 40 may be connected to needle port adaptor element 70.<br>
As a further alternative, the user may place a syringe protection cover 80, which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 14-15, onto the syringe adaptor element 50 which is attached to syringe 40, prior to delivering it to a hospital ward.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1L, the user pushes plunger 42 of syringe 40 inward, thus injecting the drug solution into receptacle 62 and further diluting it prior to infusion into a patient. Alternatively, syringe 40 may be covered by the syringe protection cover 80 and is ready for delivery to the appropriate hospital ward. Fig. 28 is a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1M, the receptacle 62 and spike port adaptor element 60 are connected via a standard infusion set 92 such as model IAS which is commercially available from Teva Medical Ltd. of Ashdod, Israel, to a patient's intravenous cannula. The connection to the spike port adaptor element 60 is performed after the removal of a connection element which is placed at the end of the spike port adaptor element 60. Fig. 30 is a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
Alternatively, the syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 may be connected via an infusion set adaptor element 90, which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 16-17, to an infusion set 92 including a port 93 and an intravenous cannula 94 which is placed at the injection site. Before syringe adaptor element 50 is attached to the infusion set adaptor element 90, the syringe protection cover 80 is removed from the end of the syringe adaptor element 50. Fig. 29 shows a partially pictorial partially sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>

Syringe protection cover 80 is preferably integrally formed, and is generally side to side symmetric about an axis 800. A generally circular locking element 802 is preferably formed at a bottom end of syringe protection cover 80.<br>
Locking element 802 preferably includes a flat generally circular base surface 804, preferably extending along a plane which is perpendicular to axis 800. Surface 804 is integrally formed with a generally cylindrical portion 806. Cylindrical portion 806 terminates in a generally circular radially outwardly extending wall portion 808, which lies in a plane parallel to that defined by surface 804. Wall portion 808 terminates in a generally cylindrical portion 810, which generally surrounds cylindrical portion 806. An elongate tab 812 extends from surface 804 along axis 800.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 16, which is a simplified pictorial illustration of infusion set adaptor element 90 which forms part of the drug mixing system of Figs. 1A - 1M and to Fig. 17, which is a sectional illustration taken along section lines XVII –XVII in Fig. 16.<br>
As seen in Figs. 16 and 17, infusion set adaptor element 90 is preferably integrally formed, and preferably is side-to-side symmetric along an axis 901.<br>
Infusion set adaptor element 90 preferably includes a forward facing cylindrical portion 902, which is adapted to surround a generally circular septum 904<br>
28<br><br>
which is sealingly mounted onto a seat 906 which is located at a forward end of cylindrical portion 902.<br>
A generally cylindrical intermediate portion 908 is formed rearward of cylindrical portion 902, having an outer circumference which is slightly smaller than that of cylindrical portion 902. At a rear end thereof, intermediate portion 908 tapers toward a cylindrical neck portion 910, which has an outer circumference which is smaller than that of intermediate portion 908.<br>
An axially extending bore 912 extends through neck portion 910, intermediate portion 908 and cylindrical portion 902, thus allowing fluid flow through infusion set adaptor element 90 when the septum 904 is suitably pierced.<br>
The assembled structure of the drug mixing system at various stages of use thereof is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 18A - 30.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 18A and 18B which are, respectively, a simplified planar illustration and a simplified sectional illustration of. the drug mixing system of Fig. IB during attachment of vial adaptor 30, the sectional illustration being taken along lines XVIIIB - XVHIB in Fig. 18 A.<br>
As seen with particular clarity in Fig. 18B, vial puncturing spike 322 of vial adaptor assembly 30 punctures septum 31 located inside top portion 12 of vial 10, thus enabling fluid flow between the main body of vial 10 and forward facing portion 348 of main body element 302 of vial adaptor assembly 30. Preferably, puncturing of septum 31 releases any vacuum in vial 10 by entrance of air into vial 10 through carbon filter 340 (Figs. 4 and 6B) and membrane 336 (Figs. 4 and 6B).<br>
Engagement between vial adaptor assembly 30 and vial 10 is preferably maintained by snap engagement of protrusions 316 and 318 of rear portion 304 of main body element 302 with a neck portion 13 of vial 10. The engagement of protrusions 316 and 318 with neck portion 13 ensures that vial adaptor assembly 30 is latched onto vial 10 and cannot be removed therefrom. Tabs 310 and outwardly tapered portions 320 generally surround top portion 12 and neck portion 13 of vial 10.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 19A and 19B and to Figs. 19C and 19D which are, respectively, a top and a side view simplified planar illustration and a simplified sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Fig. 1C during attachment of the<br>
29<br><br>
syringe adaptor element 50 to syringe 40, the sectional illustrations being taken along lines XTXB - XIXB in Fig. 19A and XTXD - XTXD in Fig. 19C.<br>
As seen in Figs. 19A - 19D, luer 44 of luer fitted hypodermic syringe 40 preferably engages inner rearward cylindrical portion 556 of sealing element 540 of syringe adaptor element 50 and tabs 558 formed thereon, such that needle 550 is in fluid flow engagement with the hollow body of syringe 40.<br>
At this stage, the sharpened tip of needle 550 is preferably placed between septa 502 and 504, and compression spring 536 is relaxed. Preferably, when syringe 40 is connected to syringe adaptor assembly 50, plunger 42 of syringe 40 is pushed fully inward with respect to the syringe.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 20, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Fig. ID during attachment of spike port adaptor element 60.<br>
As seen in Fig. 20, spike 608 of spike element 606 of spike port adaptor element 60 is preferably inserted into a spike port 61 of receptacle 62. At this stage, receptacle 62 and tube 602 are in fluid flow engagement. However, clamp 604 is closed and prevents fluid from flowing out of the receptacle through bore 612 into tube 602. Additionally, bore 610 is in fluid flow communication with cylindrical portion 620 via bore 616 of neck portion 618.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 21, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Fig. ID during attachment of needle port adaptor element 70.<br>
As seen in Fig. 21, needle 724 of needle port adaptor element 70 is preferably inserted into needle port 64 of receptacle 62. Preferably, teeth 715 of tabs 714 engage port 64 when needle 724 is inserted. Additionally, after needle 724 is inserted, cover element 740 is preferably moved with respect to main body element 700 along ribbed engagement surface portion 710 (Fig. 13B).<br>
The axial displacement of cover element 740 preferably seals and locks the connection between main body element 700 and port 64, by pressing on tabs 714 and pushing them inward. Displacement of cover element 740 includes a corresponding axial displacement of protrusions 754 with respect to slots 712 of rear portion 702 of<br>
3o<br><br>
main body element 700.The axial displacement terminates when sections 716 of tabs 714 engage inner surface 751 of cover element 740.<br>
At this stage, receptacle 62 is preferably in fluid flow engagement with bore 732 of cylindrical portion 726 via intermediate portion 720 and needle 724. However, fluid does not flow out of cylindrical portion 726, as the cylindrical portion is sealed by septum 728.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 22, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs. IE and 20 prior to the attachment of syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 to spike port adaptor element 60.<br>
As seen in Fig. 22, syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are placed in close proximity to cylindrical portion 620 of spike port adaptor element 60. It is appreciated that at this stage compression spring 536 is relaxed and the sharpened tip of needle 550 is preferably placed between septa 502 and 504. Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 engage forward facing surfaces on either side of intermediate portion 514 of housing element 500.<br>
Throughout the engagement process, septum 622 of spike port adaptor element 60 and septum 502 of syringe adaptor element 50 are pushed into touching engagement by the biasing force of spring 536, thus preventing exposure of the tip of needle 550 to the environment.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 23, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs. IE and 20 following the attachment of syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 to spike port adaptor element 60.<br>
As seen in Fig. 23 syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are pushed into engagement with cylindrical portion 620 of spike port adaptor element 60.<br>
Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 snap into engagement with wall portion 618, thus ensuring that the engagement between syringe adaptor element 50 and cylindrical portion 620 is secure. At this stage, spring 536 is in a compressed state, and housing element 500 is pushed rearwardly by the pressure from cylindrical portion 620.<br>
31<br><br>
The rearward motion of housing element 500 causes the sharpened tip of needle 550 to pierce septa 502 and 622. As a result, needle 550 partially extends through the hollow space in cylindrical portion 620, and is in fluid flow engagement with receptacle 62 via bore 610 of spike 608 of spiked element 606 and via bore 616 of neck portion 618. Due to the fluid flow engagement between luer 44 of syringe 40 and needle 550 of syringe adaptor element 50, the syringe 40 is now in fluid flow engagement with receptacle 62. It is appreciated that when using the syringe adaptor element described in Fig. 9C, needle protector 560 at least partially collapses, thus exposing the needle 550.<br>
In order to draw fluid from receptacle 62 into syringe 40 via spiked element 606, bore 616 of neck portion 618, cylindrical portion 620 and needle 550, a user retracts plunger 42. In order to disengage syringe adaptor element 50 and cylindrical portion 620, a user pushes slightly on arms 526 extending from side surfaces 524 of housing element 522, causing teeth 527 to move outward and release a rearward facing surface of cylindrical portion 620, thus disconnecting the cylindrical portion.<br>
Throughout the disengagement process, septum 622 of spike port adaptor element 60 and septum 502 of syringe adaptor element 50 are pushed into touching engagement by the biasing force of spring 536, thus preventing exposure of the tip of needle 550 to the environment.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 24, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs. IE and 21 prior to the attachment of syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 to needle port adaptor element 70.As seen in Fig. 24, syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are placed in close proximity to cylindrical portion 726 of needle port adaptor element 70.

Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 engage forward facing surfaces on either side of intermediate portion 514 of housing element 500.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 25, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs. IE and 21 following the attachment of syringe 40 and syringe adaptor element 50 to needle port adaptor element<br>
32<br><br>
70.As seen in Fig. 25 syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are pushed into engagement with cylindrical portion 726 of needle port adaptor element 70.<br>
Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 snap to engage a rearward facing wall portion of cylindrical portion 726, thus ensuring that the engagement between syringe adaptor element 50 and cylindrical portion 726 is secure. At this stage, spring 536 is in a compressed state, and housing element 500 is pushed rearwardly by the pressure from cylindrical portion 726.<br>
The rearward motion of housing element 500 causes the sharpened tip of needle 550 to pierce septa 502 and 728. As a result, needle 550 partially extends through bore 732 of cylindrical portion 726, and is in fluid flow engagement with receptacle 62 via needle 724 of rear portion 702, neck portion 720 of main body element 700 and bore 732 of cylindrical portion 726. Due to the fluid flow engagement between luer 44 of syringe 40 and needle 550 of syringe adaptor element 50, the syringe 40 is now in fluid flow engagement with receptacle 62. It is appreciated that when using the syringe adaptor element described in Fig. 9C, needle protector 560 at least partially collapses, thus exposing the needle 550.<br>
In order to draw fluid from receptacle 62 into syringe 40 via needle 724, bore 732 and needle 550, a user retracts plunger 42. In order to disengage syringe adaptor element 50 and cylindrical portion 726, a user pushes slightly on arms 526 extending from side surfaces 524 of housing element 522, causing teeth 527 to move outward and release a rearward facing wall portion of cylindrical portion 726, thus disconnecting cylindrical portion 726.<br>
Throughout the engagement and disengagement process, septum 728 of needle port adaptor element 70 and septum 502 of syringe adaptor element 50 are pushed into touching engagement by the biasing force of spring 536, thus preventing exposure of the tip of needle 550 to the environment.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 26, which is a sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Fig. 1G prior to drug dilution.<br>
As seen in Fig. 26, syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are placed in close proximity to forward facing portion 348 of vial adaptor element 30. It is appreciated that at this stage compression spring 536 is relaxed and the sharpened tip of needle 550 is preferably located between septa 502 and 504. Preferably, surfaces<br>
33<br><br>
528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 engage forward facing surfaces on either side of intermediate portion 514 of housing element 500.<br>
At this stage, syringe 40 is preferably filled with a fluid drawn from receptacle 62 (Figs. 22 - 25) and therefore plunger 42 is at least partially retracted.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 27, which is a sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Fig. 1H following drug dilution.<br>
As seen in Fig. 27 syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are pushed into engagement with forward facing portion 348 of vial adaptor element 30.<br>
Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 snap to engage wall portion 346 of forward facing portion 348, thus ensuring that the engagement between syringe adaptor element 50 and portion 348 is secure. At this stage, spring 536 is in a compressed state, and housing element 500 is pushed rearwardly by the pressure from forward facing portion 348.<br>
The rearward motion of housing element 500 causes the sharpened tip of needle 550 to pierce septa 502 and 350. As a result, needle 550 partially extends through a hollow section of portion 348, and is in fluid flow engagement with vial 10 via bore 350 of neck portion 344 and vial puncturing spike 322 of main body element 302. Due to the fluid flow engagement between luer 44 of syringe 40 and needle 550 of syringe adaptor element 50, the syringe 40 is now in fluid flow engagement with vial 10. It is appreciated that when using the syringe adaptor element described in Fig. 9C, needle protector 560 at least partially collapses, thus exposing the needle 550.<br>
At this stage, a user injects the fluid contained in syringe 40 into vial 10 via bore 350 of neck portion 344 and vial puncturing spike 322 by inwardly pushing plunger 42 of syringe 40. A corresponding volume of air escapes from vial 10 via membrane 336 and optional carbon cloth filter 340. It is appreciated that any drug containing aerosol is blocked by the membrane and any non-aerosolized drug vapor is adsorbed by the charcoal filter, thus protecting users and the environment from contamination.<br>
Preferably, the user ensures that the drug contained in vial 10 is fully dissolved, and then draws at least part of the drug solution contained in vial 10 into syringe 40 by turning the system upside down and retracting plunger 42 (not shown). At this stage, a<br>
34<br><br>
corresponding volume of sterile air enters vial 10 via membrane 336 and optional carbon cloth filter 340.<br>
In order to disengage syringe adaptor element 50 and forward facing portion 348, a user pushes slightly on arms 526 extending from side surfaces 524 of housing element 522, causing teeth 527 to move outward and release a wall portion 346 of forward facing portion 348, thus disconnecting the forward facing portion.<br>
Throughout the engagement and disengagement process, septum 350 of vial adaptor element 30 and septum 502 of syringe adaptor element 50 are pushed into touching engagement by the biasing force of spring 536, thus preventing exposure of the tip of needle 550 to the environment.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 28, which is a sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs IK and 1L in a protected, ready for delivery state, when syringe adaptor element 50 is covered by syringe protection cover 80.<br>
As seen in Fig. 28, syringe adaptor element 50 is preferably covered at a forward end thereof by syringe protection cover 80. At this stage, plunger 42 is preferably at least partially retracted with respect to syringe 40, and the syringe contains a drug solution withdrawn from vial 10 (Fig. 27).<br>
The forwardmost circumference of main body portion 523 is preferably seated in the recess formed by wall portions 806 and 810 of syringe protection cover 80 and surface 804 of syringe cover element 80 preferably engages a forward surface of septum 502.<br>
It is appreciated that at this stage compression spring 536 is relaxed and the sharpened tip of needle 550 is preferably located between septa 502 and 504. Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 engage forward facing surfaces on either side of intermediate portion 514 of housing element 500.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 29, which is a partially pictorial, partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs. 1M and 28 when ready for injection.<br>
As seen in Fig. 29, syringe protection cover 80 has been removed from syringe adaptor element 50, and syringe adaptor element 50 and syringe 40 joined thereto are pushed into engagement with cylindrical portion 902 of infusion set adaptor element 90,<br>
35<br><br>
while the infusion set adaptor element 90 is connected to a side port of an intravenous cannula located at an injection site.<br>
Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 snap to engage a rearward facing wall portion of cylindrical portion 902, thus ensuring that the engagement between syringe adaptor element 50 and cylindrical portion 902 is secure. At this stage, spring 536 is in a compressed state, and housing element 500 is pushed rearwardly by the pressure from cylindrical portion 902.<br>
The rearward motion of housing element 500 causes the sharpened tip of needle 550 to pierce septa 502 and 904. As a result, needle 550 partially extends through bore 912 of infusion set adaptor element 90, and is therefore in fluid flow engagement with the injection site. Due to the fluid flow engagement between luer 44 of syringe 40 and needle 550 of syringe adaptor element 50, the syringe 40 is now in fluid flow engagement with the injection site. It is appreciated that when using the syringe adaptor element described in Fig. 9C, needle protector 560 at least partially collapses, thus exposing the needle 550.<br>
In order to disengage syringe adaptor element 50 and cylindrical portion 902, a user pushes slightly on arms 526 extending from side surfaces 524 of housing element 522, causing teeth 527 to move outward and release a the rearward facing wall portion of cylindrical portion 902, thus disconnecting the cylindrical portion.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 30, which is a partially pictorial partially sectional illustration of the drug mixing system of Figs. 1M and 20 when ready for injection.<br>
Preferably, receptacle 62 is connected via spike port adaptor element 60 to an infusion set 92. The infusion set then connects to a standard intravenous cannula 94 such as a Venolit model commercially available from Teva Medical Ltd. of Ashdod, Israel which is located in an infusion site. Typically, prior to connection of spike port adaptor element 60 to infusion set 92, sealing element 630 is removed, and infusion set 92 is connected directly to tube 602.<br>
Alternatively, infusion set 92 may be connected to a new receptacle, not containing a drug, in which case the drug solution is injected directly into the infusion set. If this option is selected, syringe adaptor 50 having syringe 40 (Fig. 28) joined<br>
36<br><br>
thereto is connected to port 93 after syringe protector cover 80 is removed, and the drug solution contained therein is injected into the infusion line.<br>
Preferably, surfaces 528 of teeth 527 of arms 526 snap to engage a rearward facing wall portion of port 93, thus ensuring that the engagement between syringe adaptor element 50 and port 93 is secure. At this stage, spring 536 is in a compressed state, and housing element 500 is pushed rearwardly by the pressure from port 93.<br>
The rearward motion of housing element 500 causes the sharpened tip of needle 550 to pierce septum 502 and a sealing septum of port 93. As a result, needle 550 partially extends into infusion set 92, and is therefore in fluid flow engagement with the injection site. Due to the fluid flow engagement between luer 44 of syringe 40 and needle 550 of syringe adaptor element 50, the syringe 40 is now in fluid flow engagement with the injection site.<br>
In order to disengage syringe adaptor element 50 and port 93, a user pushes slightly on arms 526 extending from side surfaces 524 of housing element 522, causing teeth 527 to move outward and release a rearward facing wall portion of port 93, thus disconnecting the port.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 31A, 31B, 31C, 3 ID, 31E, 31F, 31G, 31H, 311, 31J and 31L which are simplified pictorial illustrations of various stages of assembly and typical use of a drug mixing system constructed and operative in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 31A shows a spike port adaptor element 1030, as described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 34 - 35, being inserted into a spike port 1031 in a receptacle 1032 containing a fluid. Preferably, a luer connector of spike port adaptor element 1030 is sealed by a luer cover element 1034.<br>
Typically, receptacle 1032 comprises a bag, and the fluid contained therein is sterile salt solution, water, or any other suitable sterile solution or pure fluid.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 IB, a luer-equipped hypodermic syringe 1040, having a plunger 1042 and a luer tip 1044, is connected to a syringe port of an adaptor assembly 1050, which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 36 and 44 - 45B. Preferably, the syringe port is defined by a stopcock 1052 which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 37 - 38B and includes a removable protection cap 1054. Fig. 46 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
37<br><br>
Typically, plunger 1042 of syringe 1040 is pushed fully inward before the syringe is connected to the syringe port of stopcock 1052.<br>
Fig. 31C shows spike port adaptor element 1030 and receptacle 1032 joined thereto being connected to a receptacle adaptor subassembly 1056 of adaptor assembly 1050. Subassembly 1056 is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 39 - 40B. Preferably, stopcock 1052 is in an operative orientation which enables fluid flow between receptacle adaptor subassembly 1056 and syringe 1040. Fig. 47 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
As seen in Fig. 3 ID, a vial 1060, including a top portion 1062 and a neck portion 1063, is pushed into engagement with a vial adaptor subassembly 1058 of adaptor assembly 1050. Top portion 1062 of vial 1060 preferably has a septum 1064 sealingly seated therein. Subassembly 1058 is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs.41-42B.<br>
Alternatively, if a small vial 1066 is used, small vial 1066 is pushed into engagement with a vial head adaptor element 1068, which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 32 - 33, as shown in Fig. 3IE, and is then pushed into engagement with vial adaptor subassembly 1058. Vials 1060 and 1066 typically contain a drug in soluble powder form, in a solution or in other suitable form. Fig. 48 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
It is appreciated that stopcock 1052, receptacle adaptor subassembly 1056 and vial adaptor subassembly 1058 are preferably enclosed in a housing element 1070 of adaptor assembly 1050, which is described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 43 A -43B.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the assembly steps shown in Figs. 31C - 3 IE may be performed in any suitable sequence.<br>
As seen in Fig. 3 IF, a user retracts plunger 1042 while receptacle 1032 is upright and vial 1060 lies therebelow, thus at least partially filling syringe 1040 with fluid drawn from receptacle 1032. The operative orientation of stopcock 1052 enables this fluid flow from receptacle 1032 to syringe 1040 via spike port adaptor element 1030, receptacle adaptor subassembly 1056 and stopcock 1052 in a manner that ensures that the fluid remains sterile, and that the user is not exposed thereto. Fig. 49 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
3&amp;<br><br>
The user then rotates a handle 1080 of stopcock 1052 to enable fluid flow between syringe 1040 and vial adaptor subassembly 1058, having joined thereto vial 1060, as shown in Fig. 31G.<br>
When the syringe 1040 and vial 1060 are in fluid flow engagement, the user pushes plunger 1042 inward, thus injecting the fluid contained in syringe 1040 into vial 1060 and dissolving the drug contained therein. Fig. 50 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
As seen in Fig. 31H, the user then shakes the drug mixing system of Fig. 31G to ensure that the drug in vial 1060 is fully dissolved and that the resulting solution is homogenous.<br>
As seen in Fig. 311, the user turns the system upside down, so that the vial 1060 faces upward, and then retracts plunger 1042, thus drawing at least part of the solution from vial 1060 into syringe 1040. Fig. 51 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that at this stage the drug mixing system of the present invention is preferably held such that vial 1060 lies above syringe 1040, to allow smooth flow of the fluid from vial 1060 to syringe 1040 via vial adaptor subassembly 1058 and stopcock 1052.<br>
As shown in Fig. 31J, handle 1080 of stopcock 1052 is oriented to enable flow of fluid between syringe 1040 and receptacle 1032. The user then pushes plunger 1042 of syringe 1040 inward, thus injecting the drug solution into receptacle 1032 and further diluting it prior to infusion into a patient. Fig. 52 shows a sectional view of the drug mixing system at this stage.<br>
Subsequently, spike port adaptor element 1030, having receptacle 1032 joined thereto, is disconnected from adaptor assembly 1050, which remains connected to vial 1060 as shown in Fig. 3 IK.<br>
As seen in Fig. 31L, if some of the drug solution is left in vial 1060, vial 1060 and adaptor assembly 1050 joined thereto may be stored in a suitable facility for further use. It is appreciated that at this stage syringe 1040 remains connected to the syringe port of stopcock 1052 of adaptor assembly 1050.

As seen in Fig. 54E, a user holds receptacle 2012 upright and squeezes the receptacle, thus at least partially filling vial 2020 with fluid squeezed out of receptacle 2012. This flow of fluid ensures that the fluid remains sterile, and that the user is not exposed thereto.<br>
52<br><br>
As seen in Fig. 54F, the user then shakes the drug mixing system of Fig. 54E to ensure that the drug in vial 2020 is fully dissolved and that the resulting solution is homogenous.<br>
As seen in Fig. 54G, the user reverses the direction of the receptacle 2012, such that it is now facing downward, and then squeezes the receptacle. Squeezing of the receptacle 2012 causes the drug solution contained in vial 2020 to be drawn into the receptacle, thus further diluting the solution. The user preferably repeats this action until vial 2020 is empty, thus diluting the entire content of the vial in a single receptacle.<br>
