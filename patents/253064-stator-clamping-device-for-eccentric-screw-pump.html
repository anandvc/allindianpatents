DESCRIPTION<br>
STATOR CLAMPING DEVICE FOR ECCENTRIC SCREW PUMP<br>
The invention relates to a stator clamping device for<br>
eccentric screw pumps with a pump stator disposed between a<br>
pump housing part and a pump end part, wherein at least two<br>
elements clamping these parts together are disposed between<br>
the pump housing and the pump end part.<br>
DE 41 16 697 Cl shows an eccentric screw pump wherein a<br>
pump stator is embedded between two housing parts. Both<br>
housing parts have a connection piece which lies adjacent<br>
to the inside of the stator casing. The distance between<br>
the two housing parts is limited by stay bolts. The stay<br>
bolts are connected to the one housing part by a thread and<br>
to the other housing part by a clamping device. For this<br>
purpose, the clamping device comprises a threaded shoulder,<br>
which at its outer end carries a slackly placed threaded<br>
nut, which connects the stay bolt body to the flange clip.<br>
There is known from DE 20 27 993 Al an eccentric screw<br>
pump, whose stator lining projects on both sides beyond the<br>
stator casing. The pump housing and the pressure flange lie<br>
adjacent both to the lining and to the stator casing. A<br>
spacer bolt is shown for securing the connection between<br>
the pressure flange and the pump housing. This spacer bolt<br>
is provided on both sides with threaded shoulders, which<br>
project axially beyond the foot shoulders. The spacer bolts<br>
lie adjacent to the insides of the feet and are clamped to<br>
the latter by means of threaded nuts on the threaded<br>
shoulders .<br>
DE 24 25 055 shows a stator support, wherein the stator is<br>
connected to housing parts adjacent on both sides. In this<br>
example of embodiment, the connection comprises three<br>
screws offset in each case through 120° and with a uniform<br><br><br>
2<br>
cross-section over their whole length. The screws are<br>
clamped to the housing parts by means of threaded nuts<br>
sitting slackly on their end.<br>
A mortar pump with a funnel, a feeding screw and a screw<br>
pump following the latter is shown in DE 41 04 282 Al. The<br>
connection between the screw pump and the pump housing<br>
takes place by means of quick-action tension jacks. For<br>
this purpose, there is provided at the delivery end of the<br>
screw pump and at the entrance side of the housing of the<br>
feeding screw in each case a plate which has two<br>
projections or recesses, which are provided as a support<br>
for the quick-action tension jack.<br>
A clamping device for a pump, which sits between a<br>
connecting piece and a storage container, emerges from DE<br>
295 03 838 Ul. Here, two clamping elements are connected in<br>
each case at the opposite side of the pump to a flange of<br>
the storage container and a flange on the connecting piece.<br>
Each flange has two contact points with the clamping<br>
elements.<br>
DE 91 16 377 Ul also shows a clamping device for screw<br>
pumps. Here, use is made of thin threaded rods, which clamp<br>
the flanges together in front of and behind the pump.<br>
Proceeding from this prior art, the problem of the<br>
invention consists in increasing the ease of assembly and<br>
maintenance of the pump in combination with the stability<br>
of the connection between the stator and its connection<br>
parts.<br>
According to the invention, this problem is solved by the<br>
features of claim 1. Developments of the invention are the<br>
subject-matter of the sub-claims.<br><br><br>
3<br>
The inventive clamping device for pumps relates in<br>
particular to the connection of the stator to its adjacent<br>
pump end parts, which can for example comprise a pump<br>
housing part and a pump end part such as a pressure flange.<br>
Since leaks and non-uniform pressure on the sealing parts<br>
between the stator and the adjacent pump end parts should<br>
be avoided, the clamping device according to the invention<br>
has clamping bars disposed laterally with respect to the<br>
stator, the width of said clamping bars amounting to at<br>
least 20% of the stator cross-section. As a result of this<br>
increase in the width of the clamping means, there is also<br>
an enlargement of the area over which pressure is<br>
transmitted to the contact surfaces of the stator with the<br>
adjacent surfaces of the pump end parts. The width of the<br>
clamping bars can amount to 20% to 120% of the diameter of<br>
the stator. As a result of the enlargement of the clamping<br>
bar width, there is an enlargement of the active area with<br>
which, amongst other things, pressure is exerted on the<br>
stator ends. With an equal or lower point-like pressure, a<br>
homogenisation of the pressure over the whole extent of the<br>
stator end faces is thus produced. The elastomer region<br>
projecting at the stator ends is thus uniformly compressed<br>
and loaded.<br>
In order to reduce the assembly cost, all the parts that<br>
are required for the clamping of the stator are connected<br>
to the clamping bars or fixed to the latter. The clamping<br>
bars are disposed laterally parallel to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the pump. The longitudinal axes of the clamping<br>
bars and the stator run horizontally.<br>
The design of the clamping bars can or is suitably adapted<br>
to the overall height of the pump, or more precisely to its<br>
operating pressure.<br>
The width of the clamping bar and also the nature of the<br>
connection of the clamping bar to the respective pump end<br><br><br>
4<br>
parts is selected according to the delivery pressure that<br>
the pump generates.<br>
The clamping bars can have identical or also different<br>
connection elements at the two ends. In order to simplify<br>
the assembly, the clamping bars can have a form-fit<br>
connection at their one longitudinal end and a friction-<br>
locked connection at their other end. The pump end part<br>
connected thereto is also formed depending on the design of<br>
this connection.<br>
According to one embodiment of the clamping bars, at least<br>
one end of the clamping bar is bent off at an angle and the<br>
angle thus arising forms a form-fit connection with an<br>
adjacent pump end part. The pump end part entering into a<br>
form-fit connection with the clamping bar can also have<br>
grooves, fluting, noses, holes, slots or similarly acting<br>
elevations or depressions which engage into corresponding<br>
counterparts on the pump end part.<br>
The ends of the clamping bar run at an angle of 30° to<br>
120°, preferably 90°, to the clamping bar itself. If the<br>
bent-off end part of the clamping bar itself forms the<br>
form-fit connection, the angle is not greater than 90°,<br>
unless the end of the clamping bar is bent off at an angle<br>
two or more times.<br>
In a further embodiment according to the invention, the<br>
clamping bar has one or more perforations at at least one<br>
end running axis-parallel to the pump longitudinal axis,<br>
into which perforations projections of the pump end parts<br>
engage in this region. The clamping bar can thus be<br>
connected at least at one of the two ends to the pump end<br>
parts by a slip-on procedure at right angles to the pump<br>
longitudinal axis.<br><br><br>
5<br>
A further embodiment of the clamping bar concerns the<br>
disposal of a friction-locked connection possibility at at<br>
least one end. The friction-locked connection proceeds<br>
either from the clamping bar onto adjacent pump end parts<br>
or from pump end parts onto the clamping bar.<br>
If the friction-locked connection proceeds from the<br>
clamping bar, the clamping bar is, for example, bent off at<br>
an angle in this region and accommodates one or more<br>
clamping screws. This/these clamping screw/s is/are moved<br>
in a thread of the clamping bar and thus presses/press onto<br>
a surface of a pump end part, e.g. a pressure flange. As a<br>
result of this pressure of the screw, the clamping bar<br>
transmits a tensile stress to a further pump end part and<br>
thus clamps the stator between two pump end parts.<br>
A further possibility of clamping the stator with two<br>
adjacent pump end parts exists through the application of a<br>
tensile stress on the clamping bar. For this purpose, the<br>
clamping bar ends at least at one of its longitudinal ends<br>
before a support of the adjacent pump end part. By means of<br>
a screw, which engages into a thread in the clamping bar,<br>
but which is merely held on the adjacent pump end part, the<br>
screw generates a tensile stress depending on how often it<br>
is turned. This tensile stress is in turn transmitted by<br>
the clamping bar to the second pump end part adjacent to<br>
the stator, so that the stator is clamped between the pump<br>
housing and a pump end part, in particular a pump flange.<br>
Depending on how wide the clamping bars are designed, in<br>
order thereby to exert pressure on the adjacent pump parts,<br>
the more contact areas can be provided between the clamping<br>
bars and the adjacent pump parts. In the case of high<br>
pressures and wide clamping bars, the clamping or tensile<br>
forces can be transmitted via several transmission points<br>
or areas. At the narrow end sides of the clamping bars, up<br>
to four pressure transmission points or areas can thus be<br><br><br>
6<br>
provided in each case. The transmission points can then be<br>
disposed both on a straight line and also on a circle-<br>
segment-shaped section.<br>
If the tensile or clamping force is brought about by<br>
elements such as tension or clamping screws or spring-<br>
loaded pins which rest on shoulders or on the pump end part<br>
adjacent to the stator, these shoulders can have slots<br>
which enable the lateral removal of the clamping bar<br>
without the elements having to be removed from the clamping<br>
bar.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
possible by using quick-action clamping devices to remove<br>
the clamping bars from the pump without the use of a tool<br>
and to replace the stator or to change its position.<br>
The clamping bar can, in addition to the clamping function<br>
that it performs, also assume information and control<br>
functions. For this purpose, visual displays or control<br>
elements can be put onto or into the visible lateral<br>
surface. The visual displays range from the type plate<br>
through digital and numeric displays. Pressure values,<br>
operating hours, speeds, temperatures, product values and<br>
suchlike can for example be displayed here by the<br>
integration of suitable measuring instruments or graphic<br>
images. If it concerns individual pumps or pumps from an<br>
interconnected system arrangement, the integration of<br>
switching elements for the speed control, start-up<br>
behaviour, metering of additives would be possible.<br>
In order to protect the devices, the clamping bar should<br>
also be bent at an angle at its longitudinal sides, in<br>
order to form a hollow space towards the stator in which<br>
the sensitive electrical/electronic parts can be disposed.<br><br><br>

Fig. 1 shows a pump 10, an eccentric screw pump, according<br>
to the invention. The pump has a drive 12, which is<br>
connected by the interposition of a gear 14 or intermediate<br>
gear to an intermediate shaft and thus also to a rotor (not<br>
shown). Pump housing 16 is disposed between the gear<br>
housing and stator 18.<br>
Two flanges 20, 20' lying opposite are attached at the<br>
sides of pump housing 16, via which flanges product arrives<br>
into pump housing 16. Provided in the region of pump<br>
housing 16 and in the region of pump end part 22, a housing<br>
16 and in the region of the pressure flange are supports<br>
24, 2 6 on which the pump stands. Located between pump<br>
housing 16 and pump end part 22 is stator 18, which is<br>
surrounded by clamping bars 28, 30. Clamping bars 28, 28',<br>
28", 30, 30', 30" are connected by form-fit or frictionally<br>
locked elements to pump housing 16 and pump end part 22.<br><br><br>
8<br>
Pump end part 22 is configured for example as a flange,<br>
which has a pipe connection.<br>
Fig. 2 shows one of a large number of possibilities as to<br>
how clamping bars 28, 30 are connected to pump housing 16<br>
and pump end part 22. In this example of embodiment, the<br>
left-hand ends of clamping bars 28, 30 are in a form-fit<br>
connection with the pump housing. For this purpose, the<br>
ends of clamping bars 28, 30 are bent off through an angle<br>
of 90°. Provided on bent-off legs 32, 34 of clamping bars<br>
28, 30 are one or more bolts 36, 38, which engage (s) in a<br>
hole or holes 40, 42. The other end of clamping bars 28, 30<br>
is also bent off at an angle of 90°. Legs 44, 46 engage<br>
around one or more shoulders 48, 50 of pump end part 22.<br>
Threads are introduced into the legs. Screws 52, 54 are<br>
supported in the threads and thus press against shoulders<br>
48, 50, as a result of which clamping bars 28, 30 produce a<br>
connection between pump housing 16 and pump end part 22 and<br>
thus fix stator 18 between them. If it is necessary to<br>
change or rotate the stator, the screws are slackened to an<br>
extent such that clamping bars 28, 30 can be removed. Both<br>
bolts 36, 38 and screws 52, 54 and the lock-nuts remain on<br>
clamping bars 28, 30.<br>
A further connection possibility between pump housing 16<br>
and pump end part 22 can be seen from fig. 3. The<br>
embodiment of the left-hand side of clamping bar 28' , 30'<br>
corresponds to that of fig. 2, i.e. a form-fit variant. The<br>
right-hand side of clamping bar 28', 30' is connected to a<br>
pump end part 22 by the application of a tensile stress.<br>
For this purpose, bent-off legs 56, 58 are provided with a<br>
thread, into which tension screws 60, 62 engage. When<br>
clamping bars 28', 30' are assembled or dismantled, the<br>
tension screws therefore merely have to be tightened up or<br>
slackened. The tension screws can be withdrawn from the<br>
shoulder or shoulders through radial slots (not shown) open<br>
to the exterior, without the tension screws having to be<br><br><br>
9<br>
detached from clamping bar 28', 30'. Instead of individual<br>
lateral shoulders 64, 66, an annular collar can also be<br>
provided on pump housing 16 or a pump end part 22.<br>
According to the example of embodiment according to fig. 4,<br>
the use of screws is completely dispensed with. Here, two<br>
quick-action clamping devices 68, 70 take over the clamping<br>
of stator 18 between pump housing 16 and a pump end part<br>
22. On account of the clamping, pressure arises on<br>
elastomer stator lining 74 projecting axially beyond stator<br>
casing 72, as a result of which the stator is sealed with<br>
respect to pump housing 16 and pump end part 22. Clamping<br>
bars 28', 30' enter in this example of embodiment into a<br>
direct form-fit connection with pump housing 16 and, for<br>
this purpose, are bent off at an angle at least once. In<br>
this special embodiment, clamping bar 28', 30' engages<br>
around a shoulder 7 6 on pump housing 16. In order to<br>
stabilise the position of clamping bar 28', 30' during the<br>
fitting of pump end part 22, its one end engages behind<br>
shoulder 76. In addition to this, the leg bent off through<br>
an angle of 90° can have openings into which projections 80<br>
of shoulder 7 6 engage.<br>
The second end of clamping bars 28', 30' remains without<br>
direct contact with pump end part 22. This contact is<br>
produced by means of a hook 82, 84, which engages behind a<br>
projection 86, 88 on pump end part 22. Hooks 82, 84 of the<br>
quick-action clamping devices are connected to swivelling<br>
levers 90, 92. Each lever 90, 92, which is connected to<br>
clamping bar 28', 30', reduces or increases, during a<br>
movement directed in or against the clockwise direction,<br>
the distance to pump end part 22 and thus clamps or<br>
releases the connection of stator 18 with its adjacent<br>
components. The extent of the distance by which the hook<br>
can be shortened or lengthened with respect to clamping bar<br>
28', 30' is determined by cam 94, 96. In order to<br>
facilitate the assembly, cam 94, 96 has three non-rounded<br><br><br>
10<br>
surfaces each offset through approx. 90°. The cam thus<br>
assumes three stable positions. The cam assumes the<br>
positions when the clamping devices are opened and closed<br>
and when the stator is centred in the direction of the pump<br>
housing and with respect to the pump end part. In<br>
principle, quick-action clamping is of course also possible<br>
if the length of the clamping bar itself is variable by<br>
means of a quick-action tension jack, for which purpose the<br>
clamping bar itself comprises several parts.<br><br><br>
