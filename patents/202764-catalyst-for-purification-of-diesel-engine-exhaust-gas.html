1139/MUMNP/2003<br>

The present invention relates to a catalyst for the purification of diesel engine exhaust gases and preparation thereof. Specifically, the present invention relates to a catalyst for the purification of diesel engine exhaust gas comprising a carrier of at least one sulfur-resistant refractory oxide and at least one catalytic metal, wherein at least one solid acid and/or sulfuric acid is carried on the carrier by adding at least one precursor of said solid acid and/or sulfuric acid during the preparation of the carrier, and preparation thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diesel engines are advantageous over gasoline engines in that diesel engines are much more fuel-efficient and generate much less carbon oxides than gasoline engines. But, diesel engines may generate, owing to their fuel composition and incomplete combustion due to engine strokes, gaseous waste products, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, which pose a serious health problem to deÂ¬population at large.<br>
In addition to these gaseous pollutants, diesel engines also emit "soot" particles comprising carbonaceous solids containing adsorbable hydrocarbons and inorganic compounds or very fine droplets of condensate or a agglomerates of "particulate matters". The "particulate matter" referred to herein as "diesel soot" is particularly rich in condensed polynuclear hydrocarbons, some of which have been found to be carcinogenic. Owing to these factors, many countries have promulgated strict standards to minimize the discharge of diesel soot from automotive sources into the atmosphere.<br>
2<br><br>
For the last 50 years, many studies have been steadily and extensively carried out in order to solve the above problems involving diesel soot. A post-treatment method of removing such diesel soot which consists of capturing particulate matters with a ceramic filter and then oxidizing them has been considered as the most realistic method in practice. The most important feature of such post-treatment lies in designing the filter so that it can effectively capture the diesel soot as well as in developing a catalyst, which can completely oxidize the captured diesel soot at the temperature of the gas exhausted from the diesel engine.<br>
For example, USP 4,759,918, to Homeier, ct al., describes a catalytic composite, which contains Pt, Pd, or Rh as the catalytic metal and comprises a particulate filter coated with a sulfur-resistant refractory inorganic oxide selected from the group consisting of titania, zirconia, silica, silica-alumina and alumina, that has been treated to be sulfur-resistant, i.e. alumina treated with titania, zirconia, tungsten oxide, etc.<br>
USP 5,658,546, to Kobayashi, et al., describes a denitration(deNOx) catalyst excellent in denitration(deNOx) activity and durability at high temperature, for catalytically reducing NOx in exhaust gas by using a reducing agent such as ammonia. This denitration(deNOx) catalyst is obtained by preparing a titanium-tungsten mixed oxide (component A) by co-precipitating a soluble titanium compound and a soluble tungsten compound under specific conditions, drying and calcining the co-precipitated mixed oxide, and then depositing at least one catalytic metal (component B) selected from the group consisting of cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), nickel (Ni), and tin (Sn) on said titanium-tungsten mixed oxide.<br>
3<br><br>
USP 5,591,414, to Jacob, et al., describes a sorption-oxidation catalytic converter for the combined cherno-sorptive and oxidative cleaning of diesel engine exhaust gases, characterized in that the catalytic active materials consisting of a solid acid system V205/W03/Ti02/Si)O2Al203) is doped with platinum in the form of an oxide. In this catalyst, sulfate is contained in an amount of less than 1 %, and there is no description about the effect of the sulfate to the acidity and activity of the catalyst.<br>
Rather, DE-A-42 29 471A, which is mentioned as prior art in said USP 5,591,414, describes that a titanium source can be selected from metatitanic acid, titanium sulfate, or sulfuric acid-treated titanium oxide and the difference of the titanium source does not give any difference in effects, and further the use of a sulfated titanium source cannot generate any improvement in the activity. Further, this German patent publication suggests that it is possible to use iron and vanadium in the form of their oxide or sulfates, and iron metal in its sulfate form has higher activity. However, there is no consistent tendency between the use of sulfate form and the catalytic activity, and it also fails to provide any reasonable explanation.<br>
USP 5,911,961, to Horiuchi, et al., describes a catalyst for the purification of diesel engine exhaust gas, which uses Pt or Pd as the catalytic metal and titania or zirconia as the carrier, wherein the catalyst is a mixture of first catalyst particles and second catalyst particles, the first catalyst particles consisting of a catalytic metal and WOx carried on the first carrier particles and the second catalyst particles consisting of a catalytic metal carried on the second carrier particles.<br>
4<br><br>
USP 6,013,599, to Manson, describes a self-regenerating catalyst member, which may be used to remove particulate carbon and residual carbonaceous material from engine exhaust, wherein the catalyst contains at least one catalytic metal selected from a group consisting of metals of Group IB (e.g., copper), Group VIII (e.g., iron) and Group VB (e.g., vanadium). This patent describes that the use of a mixture of catalytic metal oxides may give several advantages.<br>
Studies carried out so far show that a Pt/Si02 catalyst has good activity because it can oxidize, in an indirect manner, the soot captured on a filter using nitrogen oxides, sulfurous acid gas, water, oxygen and the like contained in the exhaust gas. 1 lowever, the platinum-silica catalyst system requires a high operation temperature of 400 to 600 Â°C. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new catalyst, which can completely remove the particulate matter at an operation temperature lower than<br>
300 C.<br>
Further, many other studies also have been carried out to develop catalysts for the purification of diesel engine exhaust gas, which use platinum as the catalytic metal, from these studies, it has been considered that titania carrier can produce better results than xirconia as the carrier material, and the higher acidity in the carrier can give the higher activity of the catalytic metal, that is, platinum [See, Am. Chem Soc. Symp. Ser., 552,250(1994)].<br>
In this regard, USP 5,911,961 and 5,591,414 mentioned above also describe that catalysts containing a solid acid such as tungsten oxide or molybdenum oxide are improved in activity for removing nitrogenous compound and durability at high<br>
5<br><br>
temperatures. However, they do not describe any relationship between the acidity of the carrier and the activity of the catalytic metal, and thus they provide no finding or suggestion of any other means to increase the acidity of the catalyst carrier.<br>
Another reason that the acidity of the currier can influence the activity of the catalytic metal lies in that there are aromatic compounds [PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon)] and particulate matters in the diesel engine exhaust gas. The aromatic compounds are of strong alkalinity, and the particulate matters have the same structure and properties as carbon black, which also have a strong alkalinity. It is believed that if the carrier has high acidity, PAH and the particulate matters can be easily adsorbed and oxidized on the carrier.<br>
Methods to increase the acidity of the carrier material may include, for example, incorporation of a solid acid, use of sulfated titania, or the like. USP 5,591,414 describes the incorporation of a solid acid, such as W03 or M0O3, and the use of sulfatized titania. However, the catalytic metal is vanadium, and platinum should be used in zero or a very small amount. Further, since the sulfate or sulfuric acid used in the preparation of titanium gel should be neutralized (to about pH 8) with ammonia, the amount of sulfate [SO42"] is very low, for example, less than 1 % of the total weight of the catalyst. In addition, even if sulfated titania is present, the difference lies only in that the titanium precursor is used in a sulfate form instead of an oxide form. Although titanium sulfate is used as a precursor, theoretically, the acidity cannot increase or decrease. Thus, there is no statement in said document about the influence of the use of titanium sulfate on the acidity of the carrier prepared from titanium sulfate.<br>
6<br><br>
When sulfuric acid is added or impregnated directly into sulfur-resistant refractory oxide such as zirconia in order to increase the acidity of the catalyst, the sulfate or sulfuric acid on the surface of the zirconia can be easily detached by water or during the oxidation of hydrocarbon, thereby deteriorating the activity of the catalyst.<br>
Further, the bonding between zirconium and platinum is stronger than that between titanium and platinum, When platinum as the catalytic metal is carried on a zirconia carrier, the activity on oxidation is low due to the strong bonding between platinum and zirconia.<br>
The above mentioned problems make it more difficult to use sulfuric acid to increase the acidity of carriers comprising zirconia when platinum is used as the catalytic metal.<br>
Under such circumstances, there has been no practical suggestion about a method to increase the acidity of catalyst or carrier, other than the use of a solid acid.<br>
The inventor has extensively studied on the method to increase the acidity of a carrier by incorporating a solid acid such as tungsten oxide and/or sulfuric acid into the carrier when preparing a catalyst for the purification of diesel engine exhaust gases comprising at least one sulfur-resistant refractory oxide such as titania and at least one catalytic metal such as platinum or palladium.<br>
Specifically, the inventor first prepared a catalyst composed of catalytic metal/tungsten oxide/titania by adding a tungsten oxide precursor and sulfuric acid to<br>
7<br><br>
a titanium gel prepared from a titania precursor, shaping and calcining the resulted mixed gel at about 600 to 800Â°C.    In such case, it was found that the more sulfuric<br>
acid was added, the higher acidity of the carrier was achieved to produce a catalyst metal with higher activity, that is, platinum or palladium. However, since the bonding force between the sulfate radical and the titanium atom is relatively weak, there arise problems in practice, in spite of the improvement in the acidity and activity.<br>
However, it has been surprisingly found that, when zirconia or zirconia-based composite oxide, such as zirconia-titania composite oxide is employed as a carrier and tungsten oxide and sulfuric acid are added during the preparation of the carrier, the catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst are significantly improved without deterioration of the adhesion of the carrier particles to achieve excellent catalytic performance.<br>

[Preparation of the catalyst of the present invention]<br>
The carrier and catalyst according to the present invention may be prepared by a common sol-gel method as described hereinbelow or any other methods.<br>
The precursors of the refractory oxides (hereinafter, referred to as "refractory oxide precursor" or "carrier precursor") used in the present invention arc selected from compounds that can be transformed into their oxides at a temperature within the range of their calcination temperatures and that can form a solution or dispersion in a suitable solution (hereinafter, referred to as "refractory oxide precursor solution" or "carrier precursor solution") when applied in the sol-gel method. Examples of such compounds include acids, such as titanic acid, zirconic acid, stannic aicd, silicic acid, and the like; hydroxides such as Ti(OH)4, Zr(OH)4, and the like; halides, such as TiCl4, and the like; and sulfates, such as titanium sulfate, zirconium sulfate, titanyl sulfate, zirconyl sulfate, and the like; and their mixtures or analogues. It is also possible to use an organic precursor, such as alkoxides, for example, Ti(OR)4 and Zr(OR)4 wherein R independently represents C1~C6, alkyl groups such as n-propyl or iso-propyl.<br>
12<br><br>
The precursors of solid acids (hereinafter, referred to as "solid acid precursor") are also selected from compounds that can be transform into solid acid such as tungsten oxide at a temperature within the range of the calcination temperatures and that can form a solution or dispersion in a suitable solution (hereinafter, referred to as "solid acid precursor solution") when applied in the sol-gel method Examples of such compounds include acids, such as tungstic acid, hydroxide, alkoxide, halides and sulfates of tungsten, ammonium tungstate, and their mixtures the analogues. A solid acid precursor such as tungsten hydroxide may be used in a solution in sulfuric acid.<br>
Said carrier precursors are dissolved in water to be converted to their hydroxides [e.g., Ti(OH)4, Zr(OH)4], which are then neutralized and precipitated with an alkali such as ammonia to form gels or mixed gels thereof. When organic carrier precursors, such as Ti(OR)4 and Zr(OR)4 wherein R independently represents C1 ~ C6<br>
alkyl groups such as n-propyl or iso-propyl are used, they are dissolved in alcohol, which are then neutralized and precipitated with an alkali such as ammonia to form gels or mixed gels thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a catalyst comprising a earner of sulfur-resistant refractory oxide or its composite oxide and catalytic metals, the process comprising the following steps:<br>
(1)	preparing a solution of at least one sulfur-resistant refractory oxide precursor,<br>
(2)	adding an alkaline solution such as an aqueous ammonia solution to be co-precipitated and to form a gel or a mixed gel thereof,<br>
13<br><br>
(3)	drying, shaping and calcining the resultant gel or mixed gel, and<br>
(4)	depositing at least one catalytic metal;<br>
characterized in that (a) at least one solid acid precursor or its solution is added before or after the co-precipitation of said step (2), and (b) sulfuric acid is added after the co-precipitation of said step (2).<br>
The process comprising said steps (1) to (4) is well known in the field as the sol-gel preparation, and its preparation conditions are well discussed in the above-mentioned prior art.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process comprises adding slowly an aqueous ammonia solution into the refractory oxide precursor solution to be co-precipitated into a gel or a mixed gel, which is then filtered, dried and added to a solution, in which at least one solid acid precursor is dissolved in sulfuric acid, removing the solvent by filtering, drying, shaping and calcining the resulting mixture of the mixed gel of the refractory oxide precursors and the solid acid precursors with sulfuric acid.<br>
The process of preparing the carrier comprising the sulfur-resistant refractory oxide is further described in detail by an exemplary case of using zirconium oxide as the carrier and tungsten oxide as the solid acid.<br>
(1) Preparation of zirconium gel as the carrier precursor<br>
Zirconium gel can be prepared according to the sol-gel preparation as follows:<br>
At least one zirconium oxide precursor such as zirconium nitrate or zirconium propoxide is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as water or alcohol to prepare a carrier precursor solution.    By slowly adding an aqueous ammonia to this solution,<br>
14<br><br>
the precursor is converted to zirconium hydroxide (Zr(OH)4), which is precipitated to form a gel. Then, thus obtained precipitated gel may be filtered, washed several times with distilled water to remove chloride and nitrate, and dried to yield a gel (hereinafter, referred to as "zirconium gel").<br>
When an organic compound such as zirconium propoxidc (Zr-(OC3H8)4) or the like is employed as a precursor, it is preferably dissolved in alcohol.<br>
(2) Loading of tungsten oxide precursor and sulfuric acid<br>
(a) Loading of tungsten oxide precursor<br>
Tungsten oxide precursor can be loaded or incorporated into the carrier precursor before or after the precipitation of the carrier precursor, that is, a gel forming step.<br>
Before the gel forming step, the tungsten oxide precursor or its solution can be added into a zirconium oxide precursor solution to form a mixed solution of zirconium oxide precursor and the tungsten oxide precursor, which is then subjected to co-precipitation with an alkali to form a zirconium-tungsten mixed gel. In such case, it is possible to perform a hydrothermal treatment, if necessary.<br>
After the gel forming step, the tungsten oxide precursor or its solution can be added into a zirconium gel after an optional filtering and drying treatment. The resultant mixed solution of zirconium gel and the tungsten oxide precursor is then subjected to an incipient wetness method, in which the tungsten oxide precursor is absorbed into the zirconium gel as the solvent is slowly removed by evaporation or distillation to form a zirconium gel containing the tungsten oxide precursor.<br>
15<br><br>
(b) Loading of sulfuric acid<br>
Sulfuric acid is incorporated into a carrier precursor after the zirconium gel forming step.<br>
Sulfuric acid can be added into the zirconium-tungsten gel or the zirconium gel containing the tungsten oxide precursor. THE- sulfuric acid can be added, after the gel forming step for zirconium gel, preferably together with the tungsten oxide precursor. A sulfuric acid solution, into which the tungsten oxide precursor is dissolved, can be preferably used.<br>
The added sulfuric acid can be absorbed into the gel by an incipient wetness method by removing the solvent as described above.<br>
Sulfuric acid used in the present invention can be fumed sulfuric acid or a diluted sulfuric acid in any concentration. Although the amount of sulfuric acid to be added is not specifically limited, it may be added in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carrier gel.<br>
(3) Drying, shaping and calcination of the carrier<br>
The carrier zirconium gel, zirconium-tungsten mixed gel or zirconium gei containing tungsten oxide precursor, into which sulfuric acid is loaded, can be dried, shaped and calcined by common methods known in this field.<br>
Drying may be carried out at 100 to 140 Â°C for 5 to 24 hours, and calcination may be carried out at 400 to 1000 Â°C and for 1 to 10 hours. Suitable temperature and time period for these processes can be appropriately selected by a person having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
16<br><br>
(4) Deposition of catalytic metals<br>
Catalytic metals used in the present invention can be deposited by a common process for depositing metal on a carrier.<br>
Specifically, a catalytic metal such as palladium or platinum can be deposited on a carrier by adding a precursor or its solution of the catalytic metal into the gell obtained as above and then drying and calcining. The incipient wetness method may be carried out before the calcination step when necessary.<br>
Alternatively, the catalytic metals can be deposited on a carrier by calcining the precursor gel to prepare a carrier, to which at least one precursor or its solution of the catalytic metals is impregnated and then again calcined. Impregnation may be carried out in the incipient wetness method described above.<br>
The temperature and time period for the drying and calcining processes may be suitably selected by a person having ordinary skill in the art. For example, the carrier, to which a catalytic metal precursor solution has been impregnated may be dried at 100 to 140 0C for 5 to 24 hours and calcined at 300 to 500 Â°C for 1 to 5<br>
hours.<br>
Meanwhile, carriers used in the present invention may have a particle size of 0.01 to 10 pM and a specific surface of 70 to 200 m2/g.    The particle size of carriers<br>
can be adjusted by a common method and is not critical in the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, a catalyst having a solid acid such as tungsten oxide and/or sulfuric acid impregnated therein and composed of refractory oxides as a carrier may generally present better effects so that the temperature for<br>

oxidizing carbon black and hydrocarbons is significantly decreased, and the activity for removing nitrogen oxides is higher than a conventional catalyst. It is believed that sulfuric acid and the solid catalyst such as tungsten oxide incorporated or impregnated into the carrier can act as a sort of solid superacid on the surface of the refractory oxide such as zirconia or zirconia-titania composite oxide to promote the activation of catalytic metals as the main catalytic elements and to facilitate the adsorption of carbon black and hydrocarbons, which can improve the oxidizing ability and help the reduction of the nitrogen oxides.<br>
According to the present invention, better improvement in catalytic activity can be achieved by using zirconia or zirconia-based composite oxide as the refractory oxide than using titania or silica. The reason is not clear but can be explained without limiting the scope of the present invention as follows:<br>
In general, it has been recognized that titania is superior over zirconia as a catalyst carrier in view of the catalytic activity, stability and durability of the final catalyst. Some articles reported that an improvement of the catalytic activity may be achieved by incorporating a solid acid such as tungsten oxide and molybdenum oxide into a carrier comprising silica, titania or the like.<br>
Meanwhile, the use of zirconia-titania composite oxide as a catalyst carrier is suggested in USP 5,000,929, USP 5,290,530, USP 5,320,998 and USP 5,610,117, wherein catalysts do not relate to the purification of exhaust gas and thus do not use platinum as the catalytic metal. Further, although there are disclosed a few catalyst in which platinum is carried on a mixture of zirconia and titania, the mixture of zirconia and titania is different from zirconia-titania composite oxide.<br>
18<br><br>
Consequently, there could not be found any catalyst in which platinum as a catalytic metal is deposited on a carrier made of zirconia-titania composite oxide. Further, there also could not be found any catalyst carrier in which tungsten oxide is employed in the form of zirconia-titania-tungsten oxide composite oxide nor any catalyst carrier comprising both tungsten oxide and sulfuric acid carried on the sulfur-resistant refractory oxide.<br>
The present inventor has found that a significant improvement on the catalytic activity can be achieved when a zirconia carrier contains tungsten oxide as a solid acid, although not'so much improvement can be achieved when titania carrier contains tungsten oxide as a solid acid.<br>
When sulfuric acid is added during the preparation of a titania carrier, it may be assumed that the sulfuric acid is present in the form of sulfated titania, that is, titanium sulfate or titanyl sulfate in the resulting catalyst carrier. However, in the form of titanium (or titanyl) sulfate, the chemical bonding force between the titanium, atom and the sulfate group is very weak, and the sulfate can be detached at a high temperature. Furthermore, an increase of the amount of titanium (or titanyl) sulfate may increasingly weaken the adhesion of the carrier particles, causing problems in practical use.<br>
In contrast, when sulfuric acid is added during the preparation of a zirconia carrier, it has been found that, as different from the case of the titania carrier, the activity of the catalyst can be significantly improved without decreasing the adhesion of the catalyst particles. Further, sulfuric acid and tungsten oxide or its precursor are added during the preparation of the zirconia carrier, much higher acidity of the<br>
19<br><br>
catalyst can be obtained and then more catalytic activity can be achieved.<br>
Further, when sulfuric acid and tungsten oxide are added during the preparation of a zirconia-based composite oxide carrier such as zirconia-titania composite oxide, a still higher improvement can be achieved due to zirconia, without deteriorating the adhesion of the catalyst particles in spite of the presence of the sulfuric acid and titania.<br>
For example, it is found that, when sulfuric acid is carried on a carrier made of<br>
zirconia-titania composite oxide, the adhesion of the catalyst particles is not damaged<br>
by the presence of titania and sulfuric acid, and the improvement of the catalytic<br>
activity is greater. It is assumed that the sulfate (or sulfuric acid) is essentially<br>
bonded to the zirconia molecule and the resulting sulfate (or sulfuric acid) bonded to<br>
zirconia can bring its acidic effect to neighboring titania molecules since the zirconia<br>
and titania molecules are present in the form of composite oxide,1 not in a mixture of<br>
their oxide particles. Thus, much more improvement of the catalytic effect of the<br>
catalytic metal can be achieved.	'	<br>
Therefore, sulfur-resistant refractory oxide used as carrier according to the present invention is preferably selected from zirconia or zirconia-based composite oxide  such as zirconia-titania composite oxide.<br>
Meanwhile, it is also found that zirconia-based composite oxide such as zirconia-titania composite oxide can improve the catalytic activity only by adding a solid acid such as tungsten oxide without sulfuric acid, but other refractory oxides, such as silica, alumina, and so on, cannot. Although the reason is not clear, it seems to be due to the high acid-resistance of the zirconia.<br>
20<br><br>
Therefore, according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to use a carrier composed of a zirconia-based composite oxide without carrying sulfuric acid thereon, for example, a carrier composed of zirconia-titania composite oxide and tungsten oxide without sulfuric acid.<br>
In the present invention, it is unclear in which form the added sulfuric acid is present in the final catalytic composition. In any way, it is assumed that the added sulfuric acid or its sulfate radical is connected to the zirconium atom to form a strong complex of zirconia-sulfate (or zirconia-sulfuric acid) and increases the acidity of the refractory oxide carrier to enhance the activity of the catalyst.<br>
It is believed that this phenomenon of achieving such high activity of the present invention is different from the phenomenon that sulfate or sulfite produced by oxidation of sulfur dioxide originated from the sulfur-containing compound in the fuel is adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst to increase the acidity.<br>
According to prior art concerning such phenomenon, the adsorbed sulfate or sulfite weakly combines with the refractory oxide to make the carrier acidic. However, when the canier is based on silica, alumina or titania, the adsorbed sulfate or sulfite, or the acidity increased thereby would decrease the catalytic activity. Thus, some studies have concentrated their efforts on developing a catalyst showing an extremely reduced activity in oxidizing the sulfur-containing materials in the fuel to sulfate or sulfite.<br>
Considering the above cases, it is very surprising that the activation temperature of the catalyst containing a solid catalyst such as tungsten oxide and sulfuric acid on the catalyst carrier is lowered when the solid acid precursor and<br>
21<br><br>
sulfuric acid are added during the preparation of the carrier. The present invention has the following features:<br>
(1)	it is possible to provide a solid superacid carrier having excellent thermal and chemical properties and catalytic activity to remove particulate matters, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen as compared with any conventional carrier;<br>
(2)	it is possible to provide a catalyst that can facilitate oxidation of S02 and nitric oxides, which are known to serve as a catalyst aid in the oxidation of particulate materials;<br>
(3)	it is possible to provide a catalyst that can facilitate the adsorption and the oxidation of hydrocarbons contained in particulate matters [e.g., soot and PAH(poly aromatic hydrocarbon)] and gases in diesel engine exhaust gas; and<br>
(4)	it is possible to provide a catalyst that shows an excellent performance to remove oxides of nitrogen by using as a reducing agent hydrocarbon contained in the diesel engine exhaust gas.<br>
The catalyst prepared according to the present invention is durable thermally and chemically and has an excellent activity to oxidize carbon black and hydrocarbons at a temperature of 200 to 350 Â°C, which is significantly lower than that in conventional technology, and an excellent activity to reduce oxides of nitrogen at a temperature of 220 to 240  Â°C  which is also significantly lower than that  in<br>
conventional technology.<br>
The catalyst and carrier of the present invention for the purification of exhaust gas can be used for diesel engines as well as other internal combustion engines.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with the aid of several specific but non-limiting embodiments utilizing Figures 1 through 13 attached herewith.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
First, the preparation of the catalyst for purifying diesel engine exhaust gas is illustrated.<br>
Preparation Example 1 : Preparation of the catalyst by using zirconia-titania composite oxide containing tungsten oxide (Pt/WO3ZrO2-TiO2)<br>
(1)	Preparation of zirconium-titanium mixed gel<br>
In 700 mi of ethanol were dissolved zirconium propoxide (Zr(OC3H8)4) and titanium propoxide (Ti(OC3H8)4) in an amount of 0.5 mol each under stirring to prepare an homogeneous solution. To this solution, an aqueous ammonia solution was added dropwise under stirring to co-precipitate Zr(OH)4 and Ti(OH)4 and form a gel, which was filtered, washed several times with distilled water, dried at about 110 Â°C for 12 hours to obtain a zirconium-titanium mixed gel [Zr(OH)4-Ti(OH)4].<br>
(2)	Loading of tungsten<br>
25<br><br>
To 4 g of zirconium-titanium mixed gel [Zr(OH)4-Ti(OH)4] obtained above was added each solution prepared by dissolving 0.273g, 0.693g and 1.68 g, respectively, of ammonium metatungstate [(NH4)6W,2039] in 4 ml of distilled water, which was absorbed into the gel by gradually removing the solvent (incipient wetness method). The resulted mixture was dried at 110Â°C for 12 hours and was subjected to oxidation at 700 Â°C for 3 hours.<br>
The carriers obtained as above contain tungsten in the amount of 6.5 %, 15 % and 30 % by weight, respectively, based on the total weight of the carrier, and the specific surface thereof ranges between 70 and 200 m2/g with a slight variation<br>
depending on the contents of tungsten and the calcining temperature.<br>
The carriers thus obtained are referred to as W(6.5)/Zr02-Ti()2. W(15)/Zr02-Ti02 and W(30)/ZrO2-TiO2, respectively.<br>
(3) Deposition of catalytic metal<br>
To 3 g of the carrier [W(6.5)/Zr02-Ti02] obtained in the above step (2), 1.45 g (corresponding to the amount necessary for depositing 1 % by weight of platinum) of an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 2.7 Pt % by weight of Pt(NH3)2(N02)2 in 4 ml of distilled water, which was absorbed into the carrier by gradually removing the<br>
solvent (incipient wetness method).    The resulted carrier was dried at 110Â°C  for 12<br>
hours and was subjected to oxidation at 500 Â°C for 3 hours to obtain a catalyst, in<br>
which platinum is deposited in the amount of 1 % by weight [hereinafter, referred to as Pt(l)/W(6.5)/Zr02-Ti02].<br>
26<br><br>
The same procedure could yield catalysts [Pt(l)/W(15)/Zr02-Ti02] and [Pt(l)/W(30)/ZrO2-TiO2], respectively.<br>
Preparation Example 2 : Preparation of the catalyst by using zirconia-titania composite oxide containing tungsten oxide and sulfuric acid (Pt/S042'-WO3/ZrO2TiO2)<br>
(1) Preparation of mixed gel and loading of tungsten<br>
Aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.693g and 1.68g of ammonium metatungstate (NH4)6W12039 in 4 ml of 1M sulfuric acid (H2S04) instead of distilled water. Thus obtained tungsten precursor solution containing sulfuric acid was added to the zirconium-titanium mixed gel obtained in the above Preparation Example 1 (1) and was absorbed into the gel by gradually removing the solvent (incipient wetness method).    The resulted mixture was dried at 110Â°C  for 12 hours<br>
and was subjected to oxidation at 700 Â°C for 3 hours.<br>
The carriers obtained as above contain tungsten in the amount of 15 % and 30 % by weight, respectively, based on the total weight of the carrier. The content of sulfuric acid thereof is approximately from 1 to 5% by weight.<br>
The carriers thus obtained are referred to as S042-W(15)/Zr02-Ti02 and SO42'-W(30)/ZrO2-TiO2, respectively.<br>
(3) Deposition of catalytic metal<br>
To deposit platinum, the same procedure as in Preparation Example 1 was repeated to obtain catalyst compositions [Pt(l)/S042-W(15)/Zr02-Ti02] and [Pt(l)/SO42--W(30)/ZrO2-TiO2], respectively, on which 1 % by weight of platinum<br>
27<br><br>
was deposited.<br>
Preparation Example 3 : Preparation of the catalyst by using titania containing tungsten oxide and sulfuric acid (Pt/SO42--WO3VTiO2)<br>
According to the same procedure as in Preparation Example I, a titania gel was prepared. To 4 g of thus obtained gel was added an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 0.273g of ammonium metatungstate in 4 ml of 1M sulfuric acid solution, which was absorbed into the gel by gradually removing the solvent to obtain a titania carrier containing 6.5 % by weight of tungsten and sulfuric acid. On the titania carrier thus obtained, platinum was deposited to obtain a catalyst [Pt(l)/S042'-W(6.5)/Ti02], which contained 1 % by weight of platinum deposited thereon and 6.5 % by weight of tungsten.<br>
Preparation Example 4 : Preparation of the catalyst by using zorconia containing tungsten oxide and sulfuric acid (Pt/SO42--WO3/ZrO2)<br>
According to the same procedure as in Preparation Example 1, a zirconia gel was prepared. To 4 g of thus obtained gel was added an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 0.693g of ammonium metatungstate in 4 ml of 1M sulfuric acid solution, which was absorbed into the gel by gradually removing the solvent to obtain a zirconia carrier containing 15 % by weight of tungsten and sulfuric acid. On the zirconia carrier thus obtained, platinum was deposited to obtain a catalyst [Pt(l)/S042--W(15)/Zr02], which contained 1 % by weight of platinum deposited thereon and 15 % by weight of tungsten.<br>
Preparation Example 5 : Preparation of the catalyst by using silica as a carrier (Pt/Si02)<br>
28<br><br>
As a comparison of catalyst activity, a catalyst [Pt/Si02] carrying 1 % by weight of platinum was prepared by carrying platinum on Davisil of 100 mesh or more and then calcining the resulted mixture according to the same method as in the above Preparation Examples.<br>
Preparation Example 6 : Preparation of the catalysts by using zirconia-titania composite oxide having different composition ratio<br>
The same procedure as in Preparation Example 1 was repeated, except that 0.1 mol   of zirconium   propoxide   (Zr(OC3H8)4)   and   0.9   mol   of titanium   propoxide<br>
(Ti(OC3ll8)4) were used, to prepare a zirconium-titanium mixed gel having a composition ratio of Zr:Ti=l:9.<br>
Then, according to the same procedure as in Preparation Example 1. tungsten precursor was added to the mixed gel and the resulted mixture was calcined to obtain a carrier, on which platinum was deposited to obtain a catalyst [Pt(l)/W(l5)/Zr02-Ti02(l :9)].<br>
Preparation Example 7 : Preparation of the catalysts by using zirconia-titania composite oxide having different composition ratio<br>
The same procedure as in Preparation Example 2 was repeated, except that 0.1 mol   of zirconium  propoxide  (Zr(OC3H8)4)   and   0.9   mol   of titanium   propoxide<br>
(Ti(OC3H8)4) were used, to prepare a zirconium-titainium mixed gel having a composition ratio of Zr:Ti=l:9.<br>
Then, according to the same procedure as in Preparation Example 2, tungsten precursor and sulfuric acid were added to the mixed gel and the resulted mixture was<br>
29<br><br>
calcined to obtain a carrier, on which platinum was deposited to obtain a catalyst [Pt( 1 )/S042-'-W( 15)/Zr02-Ti02( 1:9)].<br>
ITest Method 1] Purification of particulate materials<br>
The performance of the catalysts obtained as above to purify particulate matters was tested by using carbon black (cabot, vulcan XC12) as the particulate matter under reaction conditions and model atmosphere as follows:<br>
-	Composition of the model atmosphere used : NO 500ppm, SO2 S0ppm,O2 10%, H20 5%, He in balance.<br>
-	Total amount of the model exhaust gas : 200 ml/min.<br>
-	Amount of catalyst used : 0.2 g<br>
-	Amount of carbon black used : 0.004 g (the ratio of catalyst to carbon black was 50:1)<br>
-	Reaction temperature : 100 ~ 700 Â°C<br>
-Rate of temperature increase: 10 Â°C/min.<br>
All catalysts were subjected to a severity test at 500 Â°C for 12 hours before the activity test. In order to simulate the real conditions, the catalysts were well mixed with carbon black. The activity of the catalysts on the oxidation of carbon black was monitored by determining with a mass analyzer the amount of C02 evolved during the oxidation.<br>
Example 1<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W(15)-S0427Zr02 prepared in Preparation Example 3 and the catalyst Pt(l)/W(6.5)-S0427Ti02 prepared in Preparation Example 4 were tested<br>
30<br><br>
for the catalytic activities and were compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02 prepared in Preparation Example 5.    The results are shown in Figure 1.<br>
From Figure 1, it can be seen that, when tungsten and sulfuric acid are incorporated into different carriers, the zirconia carrier shows better effects at a low temperature (ranging from about 30G  Â°C to about 400  Â°C) than the titania carrier.<br>
Example 2<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W03/Zr02-Ti02 prepared in Preparation Example 1 was tested for the catalytic activity on the oxidation of carbon black and was compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02.   The results are shown in Figure 2.<br>
From Figure 2, it can be seen that, when the content of the tungsten is increased. the activating temperature is lowered.    The catalysts containing tungsten  in an amount of 15 to 30 % by weight represent very high activity at a low temperature in the range of 250 to 350 Â°C.<br>
Example 3<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W03/Zr02-Ti02 having 15 % by weight of tungsten prepared in Preparation Example 1 and the catalyst Pt(1)/SO42--WO3/ZrO2-TiO2 having 15 % by weight of tungsten and carrying sulfuric acid thereon prepared in Preparation Example 2 were tested for the catalytic activities on the oxidation of carbon black and were compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02.   The results are shown in Figure 3.<br>
From Figure 3, it can be seen that the catalysts according to the present invention have much higher activities than the catalyst of comparison and have very high activities a+ a temperature higher than 250 Â°C, especially around 300 Â°C.<br>
31<br><br>
Example 4<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W03/Zr02-Ti02 having 30 % by weight of tungsten prepared in Preparation Example 1 and the catalyst Pt(l)/S042--W03/Zr02-Ti02 having 30 % by weight of tungsten and carrying sulfuric acid thereon prepared in Preparation Example 2 were tested for the catalytic activities on the oxidation of carbon black and were compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02.    The results are shown in Figure 4.<br>
From Figure 4, it can be seen that, when the carrier of the present contains tungsten by 30 wt %, the catalyst has a better effect in oxidizing carbon black and a lower activating temperature than the catalyst of comparison, and when the carrier further contains sulfuric acid carried thereon, the improvement in the catalytic activity can be enhanced.<br>
[Test Method 2} Purification of hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen<br>
The performance of the catalysts obtained in Preparation Examples 1 to 5 as above to purify hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen was tested under reaction conditions and model atmosphere as follows:<br>
-	Composition of the model atmosphere used : C3H6 1000 ppm, NO 500 ppm, S02 50 ppm, 0210%, H20 5%, He in balance.<br>
-	Total amount of the model exhaust gas : 200 mÂ£/min.<br>
-	Amount of catalyst used : 0.2 g<br>
-	Reaction temperature : 100  ~  400 Â°C<br>
-	Rate of temperature increase : 10 Â°C/min.<br>
All catalysts were subjected to a severity test at 500  Â°C  for 12 hours under the<br>
32<br><br>
condition and with the amount of catalyst described above before the activity test. The amounts of C3H6 and NO were determined with a mass analyzer.<br>
Example 5<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W(15)-S0427Zr02 prepared in Preparation Example 3 and the catalyst Pt(l)/W(6.5)-S0427Ti02 prepared in Preparation Example 4 were tested for the catalytic activities to oxidize C3H6 and to purify NO (nitric oxide), and were compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02 prepared in Preparation Example 5.<br>
The results for the activity to oxidize C3H6 are shown in Figure 5, and the results for the activity to purify NO (nitric oxide) are shown in Figure 6.<br>
From Figures 5 and 6, it can be seen that the use of tungsten and sulfuric acid carried on a zirconia or titania carrier increases the activity and decreases the activating temperature.<br>
Example 6<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W03/Zr02-Ti02 having various contents of tungsten prepared in Preparation Example  1  was tested and compared with the catalyst<br>
Pt(l)/Si02.<br>
The results for the activity to oxidize C3H6 are shown in Figure 7 and the results for the activity to purify NO (nitric oxide) are shown in Figure 8.<br>
Example 7<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W03/Zr02-Ti02 having 15 % by weight of tungsten prepared in Preparation Example 1 and the catalyst Pt(l)/S042'-W03/Zr02-Ti02 having 15 % by weight of tungsten and carrying sulfuric acid thereon prepared in Preparation Example 2 were tested and compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02.<br>
33<br><br>
The results for the activity to oxidize C3H6 are shown in Figure 9 and the results for the activity to purify NO (nitric oxide) are shown in Figure 10.<br>
Example 8<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W03/Zr02-Ti02 having 30 % by weight of tungsten prepared in Preparation Example I and the catalyst Pt( I )/SO2~-WO4/Zr2- TiO2, having30C by weight of tungsten and carrying sulfuric acid thereon prepared in Preparation Example 2 were tested and compared with the catalyst Pt( 1 )/Si02.<br>
The results for the activity to oxidize C3H6 are shown in Figure I I and the results for the activity to purify NO (nitric oxide) are shown in Figure 12.<br>
From Figures 9 to 12, it can be seen that a catalyst containing tungsten and sulfuric acid carried on a zirconia-titania carrier shows a better activity on the oxidation of C3H6 and the purification of oxides of nitrogen and a lower activating temperature.<br>
Example 9<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W(15)/Zr02-Ti02(Ti/Zr=9) having 15 % by weight of tungsten and a composition ratio of Ti:Zr=9:l prepared in Preparation Example 6 and the catalyst Pt(l)/S04--2-W(15)/Zr02-Ti02(Ti/Zr=9) having 15 % by weight of tungsten and a composition ratio of Ti:Zr=9:l and carrying sulfuric acid thereon prepared in Preparation Example 7 were tested for the catalytic activities on the oxidation of carbon black and were compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02. The results are shown in Figure 13.<br>
34<br><br>
There is no significant difference in the activity to oxidize carbon black between the catalysts having tungsten with carrying sulfuric acid thereon and the catalysts having tungsten without carrying sulfuric acid thereon. The reason is probably because, owing to the relatively weak bonding force between sulfate and titania, most of the sulfuric acid added to the precursor gel has been decomposed or evaporated during the calcination at a high temperature. Therefore, carriers essentially composed of titania cannot sufficiently contain sulfuric acid or sulfate.<br>
In contrast, a catalyst comprising a titania carrier and containing zirconia to only 10 mol% shows a superior activity on the oxidation of carbon black in a relatively low temperature range over a catalyst essentially comprising titania carrier. It is assumed that a superacid may be formed by the interaction between zirconia and tungsten and/or sulfuric acid, which may give such unexpected results.<br>
Example 10<br>
The catalyst Pt(l)/W(15)/Zr02-Ti02(Ti/Zr=9) having 15 % by weight of tungsten and a composition ratio of Ti:Zr=9:l prepared in Preparation Example 6 and the catalyst Pt(l)/S04-2-W(15)/Zr02-Ti02(Ti/Zr=9) having 15 % by weight of tungsten and a composition ratio of Ti:Zr=9:l and carrying sulfuric acid thereon prepared in Preparation Example 7 were tested and compared with the catalyst Pt(l)/Si02.<br>
The results for the activity to oxidize C3H6 are shown in Figure 14 and the results for the activity to purify NO (nitric oxide) are shown in Figure 15.<br>
It can be seen from Figures 14 and 15 that the catalyst having tungsten and carrying sulfuric acid shows a much better activity on the oxidation of C3H6 and a better activity to purify NO (nitric oxide) in a relatively low temperature range.<br>
35<br><br>
According to the present invention, a higher activity can be obtained when a composite oxide such as titania-zirconia is used as the carrier than when a single oxide such as zirconia or titania is used. As noted above, it is because the added sulfuric acid and tungsten oxide are combined with zirconia to increase the acidity, which then influence the acidity of the neighboring titania to derive the high activity of titania.<br>
Such phenomena and effects can appear when oxides of silicon, aluminum, iron, tin and/or cerium are mixed in the form of composite oxide with zirconia.<br>
Among the catalysts prepared according to the present invention, the catalyst in which both sulfuric acid and tungsten oxide are carried on the zirconia or zirconia-based composite oxide shows the most excellent activity on (he oxidation of carbon black and hydrocarbons and on the reduction of oxides of nitrogen.<br>
In addition, the catalyst in which tungsten oxide is carried on the zirconia-based composite oxide such as zirconia-titania composite oxide is also novel and has showed an excellent activity on the oxidation of carbon black and hydrocarbon and the reduction of oxides of nitrogen.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a catalyst for the purification of diesel engine exhaust gas, which is thermally and chemically durable and has an excellent activity to oxidize carbon black and hydrocarbons at a temperature of 200 ~ 350 Â°C, which is significantly lower than that in conventional technology, and an excellent activity to reduce oxides of nitrogen at a temperature of 220  ~ 240 Â°C, which is significantly lower than that in conventional technology.<br>
