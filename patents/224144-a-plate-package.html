THE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
The present invention refers to a plate package for a heat<br>
exchanger device including a tank, which forms a substantially<br>
closed inner space and which includes an inner wall surface facing<br>
the inner space, wherein the tank is arranged to be provided in such<br>
a way that a sectional plane, which extends through the plate<br>
package and the inner space of the tank, is substantially vertical,<br>
wherein the plate package is arranged to be provided in the inner<br>
space and includes heat exchanger plates provided adjacent to<br>
each other, wherein each heat exchanger plate has a main<br>
extension plane and is provided in such a way that the extension<br>
plane is substantially perpendicular to said sectional plane, wherein<br>
the heat exchanger plates form first plate interspaces, which are<br>
substantially open to the inner space and arranged to permit<br>
circulation of said medium from the lower part space upwardly to<br>
the upper part space, and second plate interspaces, which are<br>
closed to the inner space and arranged to permit recirculation of a<br>
fluid for evaporating the medium, wherein the first plate interspaces<br>
in an upper portion of the plate package form outlet channels for the<br>
medium, wherein each heat exchanger plate includes a first<br>
porthole and a second porthole and wherein the first portholes form<br>
an inlet channel for said fluid to the second plate interspaces and<br>
the second portholes form an outlet channel for said fluid from the<br>
second plate interspaces.<br>
It is known to use such plate packages in heat exchanger devices<br>
for evaporating various cooling medium such as ammonium, freons<br>
etc, in applications for generating cold, for instance. The<br>
evaporated medium is then conveyed from heat exchanger device<br>
to a compressor and the compressed gaseous medium is thereafter<br>
condensed in a condenser. Thereafter the medium is permitted to<br>
expand and is then recirculated to the heat exchanger device. In<br>
such applications, it is important that the evaporation is complete<br>
and that no liquid is still present in the medium when it is supplied<br>
to the compressor, since the latter then may be damaged. In order<br>
to solve this problem, it is known to provide a liquid separator in the<br>
heat exchanger device in the proximity of the outlet for the medium.<br>
Such a liquid separator is disclosed in EP-B1-758 073, for instance.<br>
This document discloses a heat exchanger device including a tank,<br>
which forms a substantially closed inner space and which has an<br>
inner wall surface facing the inner space. The tank includes an inlet<br>
for the supply of a medium in a liquid state and an outlet for<br>
discharging the medium in a gaseous state. The inner space<br>
defines a first lower part space for the medium in the liquid state<br>
and a second upper part space for the medium in the gaseous<br>
state. A plate package is provided in the inner space and includes<br>
heat exchanger plates provided against to each other. The heat<br>
exchanger plates form first plate interspace, which are open<br>
towards the inner space and arranged to permit recirculation of said<br>
medium from the first space upwardly towards the second space,<br>
and second plate interspaces, which are closed towards the inner<br>
space and arranged to permit recirculation of a fluid for evaporating<br>
the medium. The first plate interspaces form channels for said<br>
medium, which extend substantially straight upwardly along their<br>
whole length. Above plate package, a liquid separator is provided in<br>
such a way that substantially the whole quantity of the medium<br>
flowing upwardly from the plate package will hit the liquid separator<br>
and flow through the same, wherein possible remaining liquid is<br>
caught by the liquid separator and recirculated to the first lower part<br>
space.<br>
WO97/45689-discloses an example of another heat exchanger<br>
device for an evaporator. The heat exchanger device includes a<br>
tank housing a plate package and a liquid separator in an upper<br>
part of the tank.<br>
The disadvantage of such separate liquid separators is that they<br>
require space in the heat exchanger device. Such separators also<br>
increase the complexity and thus result in higher costs for<br>
manufacturing the device.<br>
US-A-3,538.718 discloses another heat exchanger device for<br>
cooling a fluid through evaporation of a liquid in a tank. The fluid is<br>
conveyed through a heat exchanger which is completely submerged<br>
in the liquid present in the tank. When the fluid is cooled, the liquid<br>
will be evaporated and the evaporated medium rises upwardly in<br>
the tank and is discharged via an outlet conduit. In this document, it<br>
is stated that the possible remaining liquid in the evaporated<br>
medium will be separated and recirculated to the liquid in the lower<br>
part of the tank.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a plate package<br>
ensuring an efficient heat transfer and having a compact and simple<br>
construction. Furthermore, it is aimed at a plate package with low<br>
manufacturing costs.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the plate package initially<br>
defined, which is characterised in that each heat exchanger plate<br>
includes an elongated distribution element extending into the<br>
adjacent second plate interspace and substantially transversally to<br>
said sectional plane. Such an elongated distribution element, which<br>
extends transversally to the sectional plane, i.e. substantially<br>
horizontally, will force the main part of the flow of said fluid to flow<br>
outwardly towards the sides and thus to take a longer way between<br>
the inlet channel and the outlet channel than if said fluid would flow<br>
substantially straight from the inlet channel to the outlet channel. In<br>
such a way, the efficiency of the heat transfer is enhanced, since<br>
substantially the whole heat exchanger surface of the heat<br>
exchanger plates is utilised.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the distribution<br>
element is formed through a shaping of the heat exchanger plate,<br>
wherein this shaping forms a projection extending into the adjacent<br>
second plate interspace and a depression extending from the<br>
adjacent first plate interspace. The projection will thus prolong the<br>
-flow path of the fluid through the plate package and distribute the<br>
fluid over a larger surface. The depression will have a positive<br>
distributing effect on the medium. Due to the volume created in the<br>
plate package, medium will be collected in the depression and<br>
therefrom be distributed through the different passages towards the<br>
outlet channels in the upper portion of the plate package. By letting<br>
the distribution element and depression have an arrow-like shape<br>
pointing upwardly, the medium, which is collected in the depression,<br>
will be guided towards the centre. Such a shaping of the distribution<br>
element may be easily done in connection with the compression<br>
moulding of the heat exchanger plate.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the distribution<br>
element is formed by a rod-like insert which is provided in the<br>
second plate interspace. Such an insert may in an easy manner be<br>
provided in the second plate interspace in connection with the<br>
manufacturing of the plate package. The insert may then suitably be<br>
attached to one or both of the adjacent plates by means of any<br>
suitable method such as brazing, welding or gluing. The insert may<br>
be manufactured of any suitable material, for instance a metal, such<br>
as stainless steel or titanium, plastics, ceramic materials etc. An<br>
advantage of such a separate insert is that it easily may be adapted<br>
to various applications, for instance the horizontal length of the<br>
inset may be varied in an easy manner.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate<br>
package includes, in addition to said upper portion, a lower portion<br>
and an intermediate portion, wherein the first portholes are provided<br>
in the proximity of the lower portion and the second portholes in<br>
proximity of the upper portion. By such a layout, the plate package<br>
will operate according to the principle of parallel flow. It is to be<br>
noted that it is also possible to let the first portholes be provided in<br>
the proximity of the upper portion and the second portholes in the<br>
proximity of the lower portion, wherein the plate package operates<br>
according to the principle of counter flow. Furthermore, said<br>
portions may include a respective corrugation of ridges and valleys,<br>
wherein the corrugation of the intermediate portion extends in at<br>
least one direction of one of said plates and in at least another<br>
direction of an adjacent plate in such a way that the corrugations of<br>
adjacent plates cross each other in the intermediate portion. In such<br>
a way, a high strength of plate package is achieved at the same<br>
time as an effective heat transfer between the fluid and the medium<br>
is ensured.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the sectional<br>
plane intersects the first porthole and the second porthole. The two<br>
portholes thus lie at a substantially vertical line which is<br>
substantially perpendicular to the extension of the elongated<br>
distribution element. Advantageously, the distribution element is<br>
provided substantially in the middle between the first porthole and<br>
the second porthole.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, each heat<br>
exchanger plate has an upper edge, a lower edge and two side<br>
edges, wherein the distribution element is located substantially in<br>
the middle between the upper edge and the lower edge and in the<br>
middle between the two side edges. Advantageously, the<br>
distribution element may then have such a length that the closest<br>
distance to each of the side edges is equal to 0,7 to 1,0 * the<br>
distance to the upper edge. By such a length a flow cross section<br>
between the distribution element and the respective side edge,<br>
which may result in a certain throttling, is achieved, and in such a<br>
way turbulence of the fluid is obtained.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the distribution<br>
element has an intermediate portion and two outer portions which<br>
extend from the intermediate portion to a respective side edge.<br>
Advantageously, at least one of the outer portions may then have<br>
an inclination upwardly towards the upper edge.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the distribution<br>
element includes at least one interruption forming a passage for<br>
said fluid through the distribution element.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the upper part<br>
space is designed in such a way that said outlet channels extend in<br>
such a direction that the medium is guided outwardly from a central<br>
part of the plate package. The plate package according to the<br>
invention may thus constitute a compact and efficient evaporator,<br>
for instance in a cooling plant. More specifically, said outlet portions<br>
may extend obliquely upwardly and outwardly from said sectional<br>
plane. In such a way it is insured that the gaseous medium hits the<br>
inner wall surface where possible remaining liquid will be collected.<br>
Said outlet portions may advantageously then extend at an angle<br>
which is 30 to 60° in relation to said sectional plane. More<br>
specifically, said angle may be about 45°.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate<br>
package has an upper side, a lower side and two opposite<br>
transverse sides, and is provided in such a way in the inner space<br>
that the plate package, substantially, is located in the lower part<br>
space and that gap-like recirculation channels are formed between<br>
the inner wall surface and the respective transverse side.<br>
Advantageously, said first interspaces are closed towards the inner<br>
space along the transverse sides, which extend between and<br>
connect the lower side and the upper side<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Referring to Figs 1 and 2, a heat exchanger device according to the<br>
invention is disclosed. The heat exchanger device includes a tank<br>
1, which forms a substantially closed inner space 2. In the<br>
embodiment disclosed the tank 1 has a substantially cylindrical<br>
shape with a substantially cylindrical shell wall, see Fig 1, and two<br>
substantially plane end walls. The end walls may also have a semi-<br>
spherical shape, for instance. Also other shapes of the tank 1 are<br>
possible. The shell wall of the tank 1 forms a substantially<br>
cylindrical inner wall surface 3 facing the inner space 2. Through<br>
the tank 1 and the inner space 2, a sectional plane p extends. The<br>
tank 1 is arranged to be provided in such a way that the sectional<br>
plane p is substantially vertical.<br>
The tank 1 also includes an inlet 5 for the supply of a medium in a<br>
liquid state to the inner space 2, and an outlet 6 for the discharge of<br>
the medium in a gaseous state from the inner space 2. The inlet 5<br>
includes an inlet conduit which ends in a lower part space 2' of the<br>
inner space 2. The outlet 6 includes an outlet conduit 6, which<br>
extends from an upper part space 2" of the inner space 2.<br>
The heat exchanger device also includes a plate package 10, which<br>
is provided in the inner space 2 and includes a plurality of heat<br>
exchanger plates 11 that are provided adjacent to each other. Such<br>
a heat exchanger plate11 is disclosed more closely in Fig 3. The<br>
heat exchanger plates 11 are permanently connected to each other<br>
-in the plate package 10, for instance through welding, brazing or<br>
gluing. The heat exchanger plates 11 are preferably manufactured<br>
in a corrosion resistant material, for instance stainless steel or<br>
titanium.<br>
Each heat exchanger plate 11 has a main extension plane q and is<br>
provided in such a way in the plate package 10 and the tank 1 that<br>
the extension plane q is substantially vertical and substantially<br>
perpendicular to the sectional plane p. The sectional plane p also<br>
extends transversally through each heat exchanger plate 11, and in<br>
the embodiment is disclosed, the sectional plane p also thus forms<br>
a vertical centre plane through each individual heat exchanger plate<br>
11.<br>
The heat exchanger plates 11 form in the plate package 10 first<br>
interspaces 12, which are open towards inner space 2, and second<br>
plate interspaces 13, which are closed towards the inner space 2.<br>
The medium mentioned above, which is supplied to the tank 1 via<br>
the inlet 5, thus pass into the plate package 10 and in particular into<br>
the first plate interspaces 12.<br>
Each heat exchanger plate 11 includes a first porthole 14 and a<br>
second porthole 15. The first portholes 14 form an inlet channel<br>
connected to an inlet conduit 16. The second portholes 15 form an<br>
outlet channel connected to an outlet conduit 17. The sectional<br>
plane p extends through both the first porthole 14 and second<br>
porthole 15. The heat exchanger plates 11 are connected to each<br>
other around the portholes 14 and 15 in such a way that the inlet<br>
channel and the outlet channel are closed in relation to the first <br>
plate interspaces 12 but open in relation to the second plate<br>
interspaces 13. A fluid may thus be supplied to the second plate <br>
interspaces 13 via the inlet conduit 16 and the associated inlet<br>
channel formed by the first portholes 14, and discharged from the<br>
second plate interspaces 13 via the outlet channel formed by the<br>
second portholes 14 and the outlet conduit 17.<br>
As is shown in Fig 1, the plate package 10 has an upper side and a<br>
lower side, and two opposite transverse sides. The plate package<br>
10 is provided in the inner space 2 in such a way that it<br>
substantially is located in the lower part space 2' and that a<br>
collection space 18 is formed beneath the plate package 10<br>
between the lower side and the inner wall surface 3. Furthermore,<br>
gap-like recirculation channels 19 are formed at each side of the<br>
plate package 10 between the inner wall surface 3 and the<br>
respective transverse side. It is to be noted here that each heat<br>
exchanger plate 11 includes an edge area 20, which extends<br>
around substantially the whole heat exchanger plate 11 and which<br>
permits said permanent connection of the heat exchanger plates 11<br>
to each other. These edge areas 20 will along the transverse sides<br>
abut the inner cylindrical wall surface 3, and said recirculation<br>
channels 19 are formed by gaps extending along the transverse<br>
sides between each pair of heat exchanger plates 11. It is also to<br>
be noted that the heat exchanger plates 11 are connected to each<br>
other in such a way that the first plate interspaces 12 are closed<br>
along the transverse sides, i.e. towards the recirculation channels<br>
19 of the inner space 3.<br>
The embodiment of the heat exchanger device disclosed in this<br>
application may be used for evaporating a medium supplied in a<br>
liquid state via the inlet 5 and discharged in a gaseous state via the<br>
outlet 6. The heat necessary for the evaporation is supplied by the<br>
plate package 10, which via the inlet conduit 16 is fed with a fluid<br>
for instance water that is circulated through the second plate<br>
interspaces 13 and discharged via the outlet conduit 17. The<br>
medium, which is evaporated, thus is at least partly present in a<br>
liquid state in the inner space 2. The liquid level may extend to the<br>
level 22 indicated in Fig 1. Consequently, substantially the whole<br>
lower part space 2' is filled by medium in a liquid state, whereas the<br>
upper part space 2" contains the medium in mainly the gaseous<br>
state.<br>
In Fig 3, an embodiment of a heat exchanger plate 11 in the plate<br>
package 10 is disclosed more closely. It is to be noted that all heat<br>
exchanger plates 11 in the plate package 10 advantageously have<br>
the same shape and appearance. In the complete plate package 10,<br>
every second plate is turned in the manner disclosed in Fig 3,<br>
whereas every other plate is rotated 180° about a substantially<br>
vertical rotary axes coinciding with the sectional plane p. The plate<br>
package 10 and each heat exchanger plate 11 include tree portions,<br>
see Fig 3, an upper portion 31, an intermediate portion 32 and a<br>
lower portion 33. Each portion includes a corrugation of ridges and<br>
valleys, wherein the actual heat exchange between the heat<br>
exchanger plates 11 takes place via the intermediate and lower<br>
portions 32, 33. The corrugation in the intermediate portion 32<br>
extends as is shown in Fig 3, in different directions at different parts<br>
of the intermediate portion 32. The corrugations are made in such a<br>
way that the corrugation in all parts of the intermediate portion 32<br>
extends in a respective direction of one plate 11, and in another<br>
respective direction of an adjacent plate 11 in such a way that the<br>
corrugations of adjacent plates 11 cross each other over the whole<br>
intermediate portion 32. In such a way, an efficient heat transfer<br>
from the fluid to the medium is ensured at the same time as the<br>
plates 11 included in the plate package 10 are given the required<br>
mechanical support.<br>
As is shown in Fig 3, the first portholes 14 are provided in the<br>
proximity of the lower portion 33 and the second portholes 15 in the<br>
proximity of the upper portion 31, wherein the fluid will flow<br>
upwardly through the second plate interspaces 13 in the plate<br>
package. Of course it is also possible to provide the first portholes<br>
14 at the upper portion and the second portholes at the lower<br>
portion 33. It is also possible to provide the portholes 13 and 14 in<br>
other positions on the plate 11.<br>
As is shown in Fig 3, the corrugation extends in the upper portion<br>
31 obliquely outwardly from the sectional plane p forming a middle<br>
plane of each heat exchanger plate 11. The corrugations extend at<br>
an angle a, which is about 45° in the embodiment disclosed. This<br>
means that when the heat exchanger plates 11 are provided<br>
adjacent to each other in the plate package 10 the corrugations in<br>
the upper portion 31 will form outlet channels in the first plate<br>
interspaces 12. These outlet channels are formed by valleys<br>
between adjacent ridges of the corrugations and have been given<br>
the reference sign 34. The outlet channels 34 will thus extend<br>
obliquely upwardly and outwardly from the sectional plane p at the<br>
same angle a as the corrugations. This angle may be from 30 to 60°<br>
and advantageously about 45° as is shown in the embodiment<br>
disclosed.<br>
Since the plate package 10 is provided in the lower part space 2'<br>
and since the liquid level 22 lies below the upper side of the plate<br>
package 10, the medium, which flows upwardly through the plate<br>
package 10 in the first plate interspaces 12, will be guided by the<br>
outlet channels 34 obliquely outwardly towards the inner wall<br>
surface 3. The inner wall surface 3 will then catch possibly<br>
remaining liquid from the mainly gaseous medium in the upper part<br>
space 2'. The caught liquid may then flow along the inner wall<br>
surface 3 and down into the recirculation channels 19 back to the<br>
lower part space 2' where the medium is present in the liquid state.<br>
Since also the first plate interspaces 12 are closed along the<br>
transverse sides of the plate package 10 the recirculated liquid will<br>
flow down to be collected in the collection space 18. From there the<br>
liquid medium may again flow into and up through the first plate<br>
interspaces 12 of the plate package 10. The collection space 18<br>
then operates as a distribution chamber distributing the medium<br>
uniformly to different parts of the plate package 10.<br>
As is shown in Fig 3, the corrugation of the intermediate portion 32<br>
of each heat exchanger plate 11 includes an elongated distribution<br>
element 25, which extends substantially perpendicularly in relation<br>
to the sectional plane p and the vertical extension plane q of the<br>
plate 11. The elongated distribution element 25 projects into the<br>
adjacent second plate interspace 13 and meets a corresponding<br>
distribution element 25 of an adjacent heat exchanger plate 11 in<br>
such a way that the two distribution elements 25 provides a flow<br>
barrier in the second plate interspace 13. This means that the fluid<br>
is forced to take a prolonged path through the second plate<br>
•interspace 13 and may not flow straight between the portholes 13,<br>
14. Possibly, the distribution element 25 may be provided with one,<br>
two, three, four or more shorter interruptions 36, in such a way that<br>
a smaller part of the fluid may pass the barrier formed,by the<br>
distribution elements 25 for a better utilisation of the heat<br>
exchanging capacity of the parts of the plates 11 which are located<br>
immediately above and below the barrier. Two such interruptions 36<br>
are disclosed in Fig 3.<br>
The elongated distribution element 25, which is disclosed in Fig 3,<br>
is formed through a compression-moulding of the heat exchanger<br>
plate 11 preferably at the same time as the compression-moulding<br>
of the plate 11. By such a compression-moulding a projection,<br>
which extends as a ridge into the adjacent second plate interspace<br>
13, is formed at one side of the plate 11, and at the other side of<br>
the plate 11a depression that extends as a valley from the adjacent<br>
first plate interspace 12 is formed.<br>
The distribution element 25 disclosed is provided in the<br>
intermediate portion 32 and in particular substantially in the middle<br>
between he first porthole and the second porthole. Each heat<br>
exchanger plate 11 has an upper edge 41, a lower edge 42 and two<br>
side edges 43, 44. The distribution element 25 is located<br>
substantially in the middle between the upper edge 41 and the<br>
lower edge 42, and in the middle between the two side edges 43<br>
and 44. The distance from the distribution element 25 to the upper<br>
edge 41 has been designated by A. The distance from the<br>
distribution element 25 to the lower edge 42 has been designated<br>
with B. The .distance from the distribution element 25 to the<br>
respective side edge 43, 44 has been designated with C. A and B<br>
may be different but are in the embodiment disclosed substantially<br>
equal. The distribution element 25 has such a length that the<br>
closest distance C from the outer ends of the distribution element<br>
25 to the respective side edge 43, 44 is equal to 0,7 to 1,0<br>
multiplied by the distance A to the upper edge 41.<br>
Fig 4 discloses a variant of the heat exchanger plate 11, which<br>
differs from the heat exchanger plate 11 disclosed in Fig 3 through<br>
the design of the distribution element 25. In the heat exchanger<br>
plate 11 in Fig 4, the distribution element 25 has an intermediate<br>
portion 51 and two outer portions 52, 53, which extend from the<br>
intermediate portion 51 towards a respective side edge 43, 44. The<br>
both outer portions 52, 53 have a small inclination upwardly towards<br>
the upper edge 41 of the heat exchanger plate 11. The intermediate<br>
portion 51 has an arrow-like shape and slopes from the two outer<br>
portions 52 and 53, respectively, upwardly towards the upper edge<br>
41. The distribution element 25 in Fig 4 is provided with four<br>
interruptions 36.<br>
Fig 5 discloses a distribution element 25 as a separate elongated<br>
rod-like insert intended to be located in the second plate interspace<br>
13. This insert may in an easy manner be provided in the second<br>
plate interspaces 13 in connection with the manufacturing of the<br>
plate package 10. The insert may then suitably be attached to one<br>
or both of the adjacent heat exchanger plates 11, for instance by<br>
brazing, welding or gluing. The inset may be manufactured of any<br>
suitable material, for instance a metal, such as stainless steel or<br>
titanium, plastics, ceramic materials etc. The distribution element 25<br>
disclosed has two upwardly sloping outer portions 52 and 53 and a<br>
substantially straight intermediate portion 51. The distribution<br>
element 25 has three interruptions 36. It is to be noted that the<br>
interruptions 36 may be designed as holes through the insert or as<br>
recesses extending from the upper side or lower side of the insert.<br>
The heat exchanger device also includes a discharge conduit 26<br>
extending from the collection space 18 at the lowest located point of<br>
the tank 1. The discharge conduit 26 includes a valve 27 enabling<br>
intermittent discharge of impurities that has been collected in the<br>
bottom area of the collection space 18, for instance oils or alike.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-limited embodiment but<br>
may be varied and modified within the scope of the following claims.<br>
