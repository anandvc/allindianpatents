A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF N-(2-CHLORO-5-PYRIDYLMETHYL)-2-CYANOIMINOTHIAZOLIDINE (THIACLOPRID)<br>
RALLIS INDIA LIMITED, 21 D.S.MARG, FORT,<br>
MUMBAI-400 001. MAHARASHTRA NATIONALITY - INDIAN<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this    invention   and   the   manner   in   which    it   is   to   be   performed.<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
7-1-2005<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of N-(2-Chloro-5-pyridylmethyl)-2-cyano imino thiazolidine having the formula I given below<br><br>
I are useful as a broad spectrum and systemic insecticides, for the control of<br>
sucking insects, aphids, thrips, hoppers, whiteflies, scales and mealy bugs.<br>
This invention also relates to the derivatives of the above formula I where S group can be substituted by NH group which are ideal for controlling certain insect pests, which are of economic importance from the point of crop losses for example aphids, thrips, leaf hoppers, plant hoppers, whiteflies, from the order of homoptera on various crops.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The process of preparation of N - (2-Chloro-5-pyridylmethyl)-2-cyanoiminothiazolidine of formula I involves the condensation of two important intermediates namely N- Cyano imino thiazolidine of formula VI and 2-Chloro-5-Chloro methyl pyridine of formula VII.<br>
The condensation reaction between N- Cyano imino thiazolidine of formula VI<br>
and 2-Chloro-5-Chloro methyl pyridine of formula VII as reported in US Patent<br>
No: 6211379. involves the condensation of 2-Chloro-5-Chloro methyl pyridine<br>
with N- Cyano imino thiazolidine in the presence of n-Butanol as solvent at 80째C<br>
in presence of bases like sodium, potassium or calcium hydroxides or sodium or<br>
potassium carbonates	<br><br>
Method of preparing 2- cyanoiminothiazolidine of formula VI is described in US Patent No: 5591589, which comprises the reaction of 2- Amino ethane thiol with a dialkyl N- Cyano imidocarbonate in ethanol or water as solvent and at a temperature ranging from -10째C to 40 deg C and at a pH value of 7 - 12<br>
The above-mentioned process involves the liberation of obnoxious gases like ethane thiol, which are not easy to scrub, recover and reuse. Due to environmental considerations this process cannot be applied industrially<br>
Considering the importance of 2-chloro-5-chloromethyl pyridine)-2-cyano imino thiazolidine as an insecticide a need was felt to develop an improved process for its preparation which can be applied for its commercial production which will be environmentally safe.<br>
Objectives of the invention:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a simple and convenient process for the preparation of N-(2chloro-5-pyridylmethyl)-2-cyano imino thiazolidine.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an industrially applicable process       for       the       preparation       of       N-(2chloro-5-pyridylmethyl)-2-cyanoiminothiazolidine.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an efficient process for the recovery and recycle of benzylthiol by converting it to benzyl chloride in the process.<br><br>
Description of the invention:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of insecticides of formula-I<br><br>
Which comprises the following steps<br>
Step I Condensing dipotassium salt of N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate of the formula (II) with benzyl chloride of the formula (III) in the presence of an aqueous solvent or an aqueous solvent mixture.<br>
Step II<br>
Converting the resultant compound from the above step of the formula (IV) into<br>
2-cyanoiminothiazolidine of the formula (VI) by the reaction with cysteamine<br>
hydrochloride of the formula (V) in the presence of a base,<br>
Step III<br>
Condensing   the   2-cyanoiminothiazolidine   of   formula   VI   with   2-chloro-5-<br>
chloromethylpyridine of the formula VII in presence of base to give N-(2-chloro-5-<br>
pyridylmethyl)-2-cyanoiminothiazolidine of formula I.<br>
The above reactions are shown in the scheme given below<br><br><br>
The first step of the process namely the reaction between 0.1 mole of di potassium /sodium salt of N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate and 0.22 moles of benzyl chloride may be carried out in the presence of an aqueous solvent mixture of methanol and water, water and acetone, ethanol and water, acetonitrile and water etc. More preferably methanol and water mixture or acetone and water mixture. The amount of solvent, which may be employed, may be in the range of 10-15 times molar equivalents of dipotassium salt of N-cyano dithio imino carbonate.<br>
The first step of the process may be carried out at a temperature in the range of -10째C to 30째C by using ice salt mixture bath.<br><br>
The second step of the process involves the condensation reaction between 0.1 mole of dibenzyl N-cyano dithioimino carbonate of the formula (IV) and cysteamine hydrochloride is carried out in the presence of bases such as hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates taken in equal mole ratios of starting material in presence of an aqueous solvent like water. The reaction is carried out on a cool water bath in the temperature range of 0-25째C initially for 3 hours and then heated to 30 - 60 째C for 2 - 4 hours.<br>
The benzyl thiol liberated in the second step of the process can be recovered by trapping it in water, which is cooled in an ice bath and then extracted in a suitable organic solvent like ethyl acetate. After the reaction the solvent is evaporated to get benzyl thiol. The benzylthiol thus obtained is refluxed with thionyl chloride to get benzyl chloride, which can be used, in the subsequent reactions after fractional distillation.<br>
The third step of the process involves the reaction between 0.1 mole of 2-cyanoiminothiazolidine and 0.1 mole of 2-chloro-5-chloromethylpyridine, which is carried out in presence of bases like hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates in presence of solvents like acetone, acetonitrile, n-butanol, ethanol, N, N-Dimethyl formamide or DMSO, more preferably N,N-Dimethyl formamide or DMSO or n-butanol at temperatures ranging from 0-80째C, more preferably 0-40째C on a water bath.<br>
The following examples illustrate the manner in which the invention has to be carried out and not construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br>

formula IV.<br>
19.4g (0.1 mole) dipotassium salt of N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate is reacted with<br>
27.83g benzyl chloride (0.22 mole) in acetone water mixture (50ml + 50ml) at 0-<br>
10 째C for 3hrs. After 3hrs organic layer is separated, dissolved in methylene<br>
chloride.dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Solvent is distilled off to get this<br>
pure product of purity 95%.<br>
Yield = 25g (83% of theory)<br>
(b)	Process for the preparation of Dibenzyl-N-cyanodithioiminocarbonte<br>
19.4g (0.1 mole) dipotassium salt of N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate is reacted with 27.83g benzyl chloride (0.22 mole) in methanol -water mixture (50ml + 50ml) at 0-10째C for 3hrs. After 3hrs, the organic layer is separated, extracted in methylene chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Solvent is distilled off to get the pure product of purity 95%.<br>
Yield = 20g(67%of theory)<br><br>
Example 2 Step - 2<br>
(a)	Process for the preparation of 2-cyanoimino thiazolidine.<br>
11.6g of 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride is dissolved in 5 ml of water under nitrogen atmosphere and 16.0g (0.1 mole) of a 25% (w/w) sodium hydroxide solution is added, Then 19.4g (0.1 mole) of dibenzyl-N-cyano dithio imino carbonate obtained in step 1 is added portion wise. The temperature is maintained at 20째C for 2.5 hours after which the temperature is increased to 50째C and the reaction mass is stirred for 3 hours at this temperature. The pH is adjusted to 6 by adding hydrochloric acid and subsequently cooled to 10째C. The colorless solid is filtered and washed well with water, and then dried in vacuum. Yield: 9.9 g (78% of theory) Purity: 99%<br>
(b)	Recovery and recycle of Benzyl thiol<br>
The benzyl thiol liberated in this step is trapped in water and is present in the mother liquor of the reaction mixture, which is collected from the filtrate, after recovering the solvent. The benzyl thiol is extracted from the aqueous filtrate by using ethyl acetate and the ethyl acetate is distilled off to get benzyl thiol. The benzyl thiol thus obtained is refluxed with 28.56 g (0.24 moles) of thionyl chloride to get benzyl chloride, which is purified by fractional distillation.<br><br>

Formamide (90ml), in presence of potassium hydroxide 5.88 g (0.1 mole) at<br>

temperature 0.12 mole (7.02g) of potassium carbonate is added and stirred at<br>
80째C for 2 more hours.<br>
After cooling the reaction mixture to 65째C water is added and the layers are<br>
separated the organic phase is stirred at 50째C for 3 hours and subsequently<br>
