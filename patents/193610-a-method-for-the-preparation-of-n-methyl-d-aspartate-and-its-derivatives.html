Case 20631<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formulae<br><br>
wherein<br>
R - R	are, independently from each other, hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy,<br>
amino, nitro, lower-alkyl-sulfonylamido, or acetamido;<br>
c	o<br>
R -R	are, independently from each other hydrogen, lower-alkyl, halogen,<br>
trifluoromethyl or lower-alkoxy;<br>
and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Particularly, the present invention is concerned with a process for the preparation of compounds of general formula I-a.<br>
The compounds of formulae I-a and I-b are NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-subtype selective blockers, which have a key function in modulating neuronal activity and plasticity which makes them key players in mediating processes underlying development of CNS including learning and memory formation and function.<br>
Under pathological conditions of acute and chronic forms of neurodegeneration overactivation of NMDA receptors is a key event for triggering neuronal cell death. NMDA receptors are composed of members from two subunit famihes, namely NR-1 (8 different splice variants) and NR-2 (A to D) originating from different genes. Members from the two subunit families show a distinct distribution in different brain areas. Heteromeric combinations of NR-1 members with different NR-2 subunits result in NMDA receptors, displaying different pharmacological properties. Possible therapeutic indications for<br>
DV/24.01.01<br><br>
NMDA receptor subtype specific blockers include acute forms of neurodegeneration caused, e.g., by stroke or brain trauma; chronic forms of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease or ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); neurodegeneration associated with bacterial or viral infections, diseases such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression and acute/chronic pain.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared by methods known in the art, e.g. in WO 95/25721, for example by processes described below, which comprises<br><br>
wherein the substituents are as defined above and X signifies a leaving group, and, if desired,<br>
b)	converting the compound of formula I obtained into a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salt, and, if desired,<br>
c)	converting a racemic mixture at the stage of formula III or at the stage of formula<br>
I into enantiomeric compounds III-a, III-b<br><br><br>
or I-a, I-b respectively, thus obtaining optically pure compounds. However, the above processes usually lead to yields of 10% or less of the desired compound due to the poor efficiency of the methods employed, i.e. resolution by crystallization of diasteromeric salts.<br>
It has now been found that the compounds of formula I-a and I-b can be prepared more effectively and with considerably higher yield if manufactured according to the reaction scheme depicted below:<br><br><br>
 or the corresponding cis configurated enantiomer, 7b, lll-b and l-b, respectively<br>
wherein<br>
are as defined above;<br>
R9	is an amino protecting group, preferably benzyl;<br>
R10 and R10     are independently a carboxylic acid protecting group;<br>
Y and X	represent independently a leaving group; and<br>
AZ	signifies a mineral acid from the group of HBF4, H2SO4, HPFg,<br>
HBr, HI, HCl, HSbFg or HCIO4, or a strong organic acid from the group of C1-8-alkylSO3H, picric acid, formic acid, a lower alkylcarboxylic acid such as e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid or<br><br>
trifluoroacetic acid, or a dicarboxylic acid, such as e.g. oxalic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid or phthalic acid.<br>
Step 5 (asymmetric hydrogenation) and step 6 (deprotection of the ring nitrogen) can be inverted (Step 6* and step 5*).<br>
The new process involves several key steps such as new methods for the preparation of the intermediates of formula II<br><br>
and of formula III, especially by a new approach for the enantioselective preparation of the intermediate of formula III, i.e. of the intermediates of formulae<br><br>
a) A new process for the preparation of the compound of formula (4) or of a salt thereof starting with a protected glycin (1) and a butyric acid derivative (2). The new process is considerably shorter and gives much higher yields than the conventionally used processes described in Helv. Chim. Acta, 1954, 20, 178; J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1948, 71, 896 or in I. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1,1998, 3673.<br><br><br>
Y	signifies a leaving group;<br>
R10 and R10	signify independently a carboxylic acid protecting group;<br>
R9	signifies an amino protecting group, preferably benzyl; and<br>
AZ	is as defined above.<br>
The compound of formula (4) is then transformed according to standard procedures as depicted in reaction scheme 1, by benzylation in position 4 of the piperidine ring to form a compound of formula (5) (step 3). Subsequent decarboxylation and formation of the stable salt yields a compound of formula (6) (step 4).<br>
b) Both the free base of formula (6 and 6bis) and its salts can be submitted to the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, which proceeds with concomitant dynamic-kinetic resolution. However, due to the limited stability of the free base, according to the invention a salt thereof is preferentially submitted to the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction in the presence of a homogeneous chiral catalyst, a chiral diamine and an organic or an inorganic base (step 5 and step 5*, respectively).<br><br><br>
thiophenol (8) and 2-bromoethanol and subsequent transformation with SOCI2 to obtain the highly mutagenic and unstable substituted (2-chloroethylsulfanyl)-benzene. The new and enhanced process for the preparation of intermediates of formula (II) avoids the presence of said highly mutagenic and unstable compound:<br><br>
wherein X is a leaving group, preferably a halogen, and R1-R4 are as defined above.<br>
The invention is thus concerned with a new process for the preparation of chiral compounds of formula I-a and I-b, respectively, which comprises:<br>
Step 1, reacting a protected amino acid ester (1) with a 4-substituted butyric acid derivative (2) in the presence of a base to form an N-protected alkyloxycarbonylmethyl-amino-butyric acid derivative (3); preferred bases for the present reaction are organic bases such as triethylamine, ethyl-diisopropylamine, or inorganic bases such as K2CO3 or Na2C03. The reaction is carried out in an inert polar solvent preferably in dimethylformamide (DMF), dioxane or acetonitrile. The reaction is carried out at a temperature between 0°C and 120°C, preferably at a temperature between 40°C and 80°C.<br>
Step 2, cyclising the protected alkoxycarbonylmethyl amino butyric acid derivative (3) in a Dieckmann condensation to yield protected alkyl 3-oxo-piperidine carboxylate (4) which is isolated as a salt fi-om a mineral acid or a strong organic acid, preferably as the hydrochloride salt. The reaction is preferably carried out in an apolar aromatic solvent such as toluene at a temperature of about 40°C to about 120°C, preferably at a temperature of about 85°C.<br><br>
Step 3, benzylating the protected alkyl 3-oxo-piperidine carboxylate (4) salt. This reaction is well known in the art and can be carried out for example in the presence of a base and an appropriate solvent, such as for example with potassium-tert.-butoxyde in tetrahydrofliran (THF), with NaH in THF, NaOC2H5 in ethanol, K2CO3 in THF or in dimethylformamide (DMF).<br>
Step 4, decarboxylation of the benzylated N-protected alkyl 3-oxo-piperidine carboxylate (5). The decarboxylation reaction is carried out by methods known in the art, for example by heating in the presence of a strong acid such hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. The resulting salt is identified by formula (6) or (6bis).<br>
Step 5 and 5*, asymmetric hydrogenation of the salt of formula (6) or (6bis) in presence of a ruthenium complex with a chiral diphosphine ligand, a chiral diamine and an organic or an inorganic base.<br>
Typical of Steps 5 and 5* is the fact that the substrates (6) and (6bis) are racemic compounds which contain weakly acidic protons on the chiral carbon atoms. During the asymmetric hydrogenation the chiral catalyst converts at first only one enantiomer of (6) or (6bis). In the mean time, due to the configurational lability of the chiral center, the other enantiomer is racemized in situ by the base. Since the desired enantiomer of (6) and (6bis) to be hydrogenated is generated continuously from the undesired one, finally 100% yield of the single desired enantiomer of the products (7a) or (Ill-a) can be obtained.<br>
It has been found that the salt of the piperidine derivative of formula (6) is stable and can be hydrogenated in high optical and chemical yields by the process according to the invention. The hydrogenation may also be performed with the salt of the unprotected piperidine derivative of formula (6bis).<br>
The asymmetric hydrogenation is carried out in presence of a ruthenium phosphine complex represented by the formula<br>
Ru(E)2(L)(A)	IV<br>
wherein<br>
E	is a halogen atom;<br>
L	is a chiral diphosphine ligand; and<br>
A	is a chiral diamine.<br>
Complexes of type IV can be specifically prepared, isolated and characterized in analogy to the methods described in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998, 37, 1703-1707 and in the references cited therein, or can be prepared "in situ" from components as described in<br><br>
above mentioned reference, and be employed without intermediate isolation in the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation. When the complexes of type IV are prepared "in situ", the amount of chiral diphosphine ligand (L) used in the reaction can vary from 0.5 to 2.5 equivalents relative to ruthenium, preferably from 0.8 to 1.2 equivalents. Analogously the amount of chiral diamine can vary from 0.5 to 2.5 equivalents based on the amount of the ruthenium-complex, preferably 1 to 2 equivalents.<br>
Suitable chiral diphosphine Ugands are known in the art. Such ligands are for example atropisomeric biphenyl-phosphine or binaphthyl-phosphine derivatives. Further ligands which may be useful in the present hydrogenation are l,2-bis(2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene as described in USP 5,171,892; l-[2-(diphenylphosplvno)-ferrocenyl]ethyl-di-tert.-butyl-phosphine as described in EP 0 564 406; l-[2-(di-(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-phosphino)ferrocenyl]ethyl-di-phenyl-phosphine as in EP 0 646 590; 4,12-bis(diphenylphosphino)-[2.2]paracyclophane (Tetrahedron Letters 1998, 39,4441-4444); 4,4'-Bisdiphenylphosphine-2,2',5,5'-tetramethyl-3,3'-dithiophene (WO 96/01831); 2,2'-Bis-(diphenylphosphinyl)-3,3'-dibenzo[b]thiophene (WO 96/01831); (2R,2'R)-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-(lR,rR)-dicyclopentane and enantiomer (WO 97/47633); l,2-Bis{(lR,2R,4R,5R)-2,5-bis-isopropyl-8-phenylphosphabicyclo[2.2.1]-heptyl}benzene and enantiomer (WO 97/47633); 2,2',3,3'-Tetraphenyl-4,4',5,5'-tetra-methyl-6,6'-bis-phosphanorborna-2,5-dienyl (Chem Eur Journal 1997, 3, 1365-1369); (aR-aR')-2,2'-Bis(a-N,N-dimethylaminopropyl)-(S,S)-l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene and enantiomer (Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1999,10, 375-384); and ((5,6),(5',6')-Bis(methylenedioxy)biphenyl-2,2'-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (EP 850945).<br><br><br><br>
Above-mentioned diphosphine ligands are known in the art and can be prepared for example as described in EP 0 398 132 and WO-92/16535 (MeOBIPHEP; 3,5-iPr-MeOBIPHEP), in EP 0 104 375 (BIPHEMP) and in EP 0 580 331 (BINAP).<br>
In order to obtain high yields of the cis-configurated product of formula Ill-a and Ill-b, respectively, in high optical purity it is essential that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a chiral diamine which is in "unlike" configuration to the chiral complex, i.e. it is important that the diphosphine is (S) and the diamine is (R,R) or that the diphosphine is (R) and the diamine is (S,S). The reaction is carried out in presence of chiral diamines as depicted below:<br><br><br>
Further suitable chiral diamines are propane- and butanediamines. An especially preferred chiral diamine is DPEN (V), (R,R) or (S,S)-l,2-diphenylethylenediamine. The chiral diamines are commercially available or can be prepared according to known methods.<br>
The hydrogenation is preferably carried out in an organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions. As such solvents there can be mentioned, in particular, lower alcohols such as e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, trifluoroethanol or mixtures of such alcohols with halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, hexafluorobenzene and the like or with ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. Preferred solvent for the reaction are lower alcohols, especially preferred is isopropanol. The reaction is carried out at a concentration of about 1 to 50%, ideally about 5 to 30%.<br>
The substrate-to-catalyst molar ratio (S/C ratio) is 10-roOO'OOO, preferably 100-SOO'OOO. The hydrogenation is carried out at a pressure of 10^ -10^ Pa, ideally at a pressure of about 105 to 107 Pa and at a temperature of about 0°C to about 50°C, ideally at 20°C to 40°C.<br>
The amount of base present in the reaction is 1.0 - 0.001, preferably 0.05 - 0.2 mol equivalents with respect to the substrate in addition to 1 mol equivalent of base which is necessary to neutralize the acid salt of the substrate of formula (6) or (6bis), respectively.<br>
Preferred bases used in the asymmetric hydrogenation are for example inorganic or organic bases. Preferred inorganic bases are alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides.<br><br>
carbonates, hydrogenocarbonates, alcoholates or silanolates such as for example LiOH, LiOCHj, LiOC2H5, LiOCH(CH3)2, LiOC(CH3)3, NaOH, NaOCHj, NaOCaHj, NaOCH(CH3)2, NaOC(CH3)3, KOH, KOCH3, KOC2H5, KOCH(CH3)2, KOC(CH3)3. KOSi(CH3)3, or CS2CO3 preferred inorganic bases are alcoholates, especially KOC(CH3)3. Preferred organic bases are tertiary amines such as triethylamine, ethyl-diisopropylamine, tripropylamine and the like.<br>
The asymmetric hydrogenation of step 5 can be carried out either batchwise or in a continuous manner.<br>
Step 6, deprotection of the compound of formula (7a) or the isomer (7b) under standard conditions depending on the N protecting group , for example by hydrogenation of the N-benzylated compound in presence of Pd/C to form the unprotected amine Ill-a and Ill-b, respectively.<br>
Step 6*, refers to the deprotection of the compound of formula (6) in analogy to step 6, to compound (6bis) which is then subsequently submitted to the asymmetric hydrogenation (step 5* discussed above).<br>
Step 7, treating the sulfone intermediate of formula II with a base to form the corresponding vinyl sulfone derivative which is subsequently reacted with the piperidine derivative of formula Ill-a or Ill-b to the desired product of formula I-a or I-b, respectively. The reaction is carried out in presence of bases such as triethylamine in solvents such as CH2CI2.<br>
As already mentioned previously sulfones of formula II are usually prepared by halogenation of the hydroxy thioether of formula (9) to form the highly toxic and unstable chlorothioether which is then subsequently oxidized to form the intermediate of formula II. The invention now provides a new process to produce this intermediate of formula II, see Scheme 4 which avoids the formation of highly toxic intermediates. The process according to the invention consists of the following steps:<br>
step a), a substituted thiophenyl derivative (8) is deprotonated in presence of a strong inorganic or organic base and subsequently reacted with 2-haloethanol to form the thioether of formula (9);<br>
step b), oxidation of the thioether (9) in presence of an oxidative agent such as 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), H2O2/ACOH, KMn04, tBuOOH, NMO/OSO4, or oxone® to yield the corresponding sulfone of formula (10); and<br>
Step c), replacement of the hydroxy group of the sulfone derivative by a halogen atom e.g. with SOX'2. wherein X' is halogen, e.g. chlorine, bromine or iodine in the presence of pyridine in dichloromethane.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane-sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term " alkyl" refers to both straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms; whereas the term "lower alkyl" refers to both straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, tert.-butyl and the like.<br>
The term "lower-alkyl-sulfonylamido" refers to sulfonamido groups substituted with "lower alkyl" groups as defined above.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to a cyclic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 7 carbon atoms. Such groups are for example cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and the like.<br>
The term "optionally substituted phenyl" refers to unsubstituted phenyl or mono, di-or trisubstituted phenyl groups with substituents such as lower alkyl, alkoxy groups or halogenated alkyl such as trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, or substituted with halogen, hydroxy, amino, dialkylamino or acetamido, or substituted with phenyl or trialkylsilyl and the like.<br>
As used herein "heterocyclic ring" refers to 5 or 6-membered rings containing one or two hetero atoms chosen from O, S and N. Examples of preferred heterocyclic rings are furane, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine and pyrimidine. The heterocyclic rings may be unsubstituted or substituted with substituents as defined for "substituted phenyl".<br>
As used herein the term "leaving group" refers to conventionally used easily substituted functional groups such as halogen, e.g. chlorine, bromine or iodine, or organic acid residues such as sulfonic acid derivatives, e.g. p-toluene sulfonate, brosylate, methylsulfonate, triflate (trifluoromethylsulfonate) and the like.<br>
Nucleophilic substitution of the leaving groups (steps 1 and 7) are carried out by methods known in the art, e.g. in inert organic solvents under basic conditions. "Inert organic solvents" refers to polar solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl-acetamide (DMA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or to alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or to cyclic ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofurane (THF), or to halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, or to aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, or to nitriles, such as acetonitrile, or to mixtures of the named solvents. As bases are used inorganic or organic bases. Preferred inorganic bases are alkali or alkaline earth<br><br>
metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogenocarbonates, alcoholates or silanolates. Preferred organic bases are tertiary amines such as triethylamine, ethyl-diisopropylamine, tripropylamine and the Uke.<br>

Especially preferred amino protecting are benzyl, tert.-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) and benzyloxycarbonyl (Z). For the hydrogenation step (step 5) to be highly enantioselective it is essential that the protected nitrogen is basic, therefore benzyl is an especially preferred protecting group.<br>
