AeecnTAiweg- THE   NATURE   OF -w&amp;-rn/<br>
INVENTION   AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
1<br><br>
TITLE<br>
INTERACTIVE  SYSTEM   FOR  BUILDING  AND  SHARING  ONE'S  OWN<br>
DATABANK   OF  WISDOM   BYTES,   SUCH   AS  WORDS   OF  WISDOM,<br>
BASIC   TRUTHS   AND/OR   FACTS   AND   FEATS,   IN   ONE   OR   MORE<br>
5	LANGUAGES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an interactive System for building (including saving, appending, retrieving, modifying) and sharing one's own databank of WISDOM  BYTES,  such  as Words of Wisdom  like adages,  aphorisms,<br>
10	apothegms, axioms, catchwords, dictums, epigrams, epithets, expressions,<br>
gospels, home truths, idioms, mantras, maxims, mottos, phrases, proverbs, quotations, sayings, slogans and such others, Basic Truths, and/or Facts and Feats, in one or more languages, for increasing and improving one's own knowledge of such data, it being accepted that such data is used in<br>
15	daily life, in conversation, education and social life.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that over the years, holy books, fables, sages and<br>
saints, great leaders and revolutionaries, poets and writers, artists and<br>
entertainers, builders and titans, scientists and thinkers, heroes, have made<br>
statements,   announcements,   proclamations,   etc.   that   have   also   been<br>
20	accepted as Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths, and people use such<br>
Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths as a part of their daily conversation,<br>
such Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths also being used extensively during<br>
the grooming years of a person while being educated at schools, colleges,<br>
2<br><br>
universities, and that such Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths help to motivate people.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that people are always interested in knowing about<br>
and remaining updated about various kinds of Facts and Feats, and that<br>
5	such Facts and Feats continue to interest people, and several institutions,<br>
organizations, business houses continue to record and publish such Facts and Feats.<br>
It is accepted that, traditionally, it has always been such publishers who have been the ones to have recorded and published such WISDOM BYTES and<br>
10	that, as individuals, one needs to refer to such publications from time to time,<br>
to learn about, or obtain more information about Words of Wisdom, Basic Truths, and/or Facts and Feats.<br>
it is also accepted that such publications are not published as and when new Words of Wisdom, Basic Truths become common usage, as well as when<br>
15	new Facts are discovered and when new Feats are achieved and people<br>
therefore have to wait for a long time to receive such updated information regarding the same.<br>
It is also accepted that the recording and publishing of Words of Wisdom, Basic Truths, and/or Facts and Feats is an activity mostly restricted to such<br>
20	publishers, and that, as such, recording and publishing is not an activity<br>
conducted by an individual because this activity requires large amount of<br>
resources   and   infrastructure.   Consequently,   people   continue  to   remain<br>
dependent on such publications, which are generally published with updated<br>
information according to time schedules decided by such publishers.<br>
3<br><br>
It is also an accepted fact that such publications contain static information,<br>
and are not customizable, in that, they do not allow the user to build and<br>
share a "personalized" databank of such information which may be<br>
proprietary and yet unpublished, and to further classify such information by<br>
5	the Source of Information, Type of WISDOM BYTE, Subject, Sub subjects,<br>
and which further allows the user to add more information like the Meaning<br>
and details of Origin where applicable, Add Image, Animation and/or Sound<br>
files to the same, Associate more information in the form of<br>
File(s)/URLs/Remarks to the same; Delete unwanted information and Print<br>
10	the stored information.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths are part of<br>
one's daily conversation and are extensively used in education and people<br>
like to use Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths in their daily conversation. It<br>
15	is a well-accepted fact that such Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths help to<br>
motivate people. Because Words of Wisdom and Basic Truths are useful in general and are popular with one and all, there is a lot of literature written on such topics.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that new Facts are being discovered and new Feats<br>
20	are being achieved, and that such new Facts and Feats are continuously<br>
recorded for the benefit of people and that people like to be aware of the same for personal and/or professional reasons.<br>
4<br><br>
It is a well-accepted fact that such WISDOM BYTES continue to educate,<br>
inspire and amaze people, and therefore there is a lot of literature written<br>
about them, as well as there are several programs that continue to be<br>
produced and broadcast through various media like the television, radio,<br>
5	Internet among others, on them.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that people generally cannot remember a large<br>
amount of data whether by classifications or not, without external help, and it<br>
would be very helpful if there were to exist a System that would help people<br>
to Add, Retrieve, Modify, Delete, Print, Export, Import, Schedule such<br>
10	WISDOM  BYTES, thereby helping  people to remember such WISDOM<br>
BYTES for use in daily life, for motivation, and to increase their knowledge on the same.<br>
Chinese Patent No. CN1172683 relates to a kind of playing cards that has 52 cards of hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs, each including 13 cards<br>
15	from A to  K.  The  Chinese characters  represent twelve  animals which<br>
symbolizes the year in which one is born are divided into 3 groups, each group being put on a set of playing cards. The twelve animals are put on three set of playing card respectively. Each card has an idiom relative to said animal. Said playing cards will enrich the knowledge on idioms for<br>
20	players.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,453,280 relates to an Electronic dictionary capable of identifying idioms, having an idiom processing function which can automatically identify idioms included in a present sentence from text of a<br>
5<br><br>
first language, and which can output corresponding translated expressions<br>
in a second language. The electronic dictionary is operative to perform a<br>
technique which comprises an idiom processing operation which makes<br>
automatic identification possible by text capturing, sentence segmenting,<br>
5	local   parsing   and   transfer   lexicon   matching.   The   electronic   dictionary<br>
provides intelligent translation at the idiom level.<br>
European Patent Document EP1215656 relates to Idiom handling in Voice Service systems. The grammar of the speech input to a voice service system is normally specified by the voice service system. However, this can<br>
10	produce problems in respect of idioms, such as dates, which are expressed<br>
different ways by different users. To facilitate the handling of idioms, a user is permitted to specify their own idiom grammar which is then used by the voice service system to interpret idioms in speech input from that user. Typically, the normal grammar of speech input is specified by grammar tags<br>
15	used to mark up a voice page script interpreted by a voice page browser; in<br>
this case, it will generally be the voice browser that is responsible for employing the user-specified idiom grammar to interpret the corresponding idiom in the speech input by the user. The user-specified grammar can be pre-specified directly to the voice browser by the user or fetched by the<br>
20	browser from a remote location on the fly.<br>
Chinese Patent No.CN1086622,relates to a Chinese proverb spelling game comprising of Chinese proverbs spelling cards as an entertainment tool for the learning and exercise of proverbs and phonetic letters features that the<br>
6<br><br>
chosen basic phonetic syllables are marked on cards falling into one of four groups and blank cards are used as variable phonetic cards. Two dices with special marks are also used. Said limited cards are combined to form unlimited proverbs.<br>
5	U.S. Patent No. 6,507,811 provides a method for symbol manipulation in an<br>
electronic data processing system that can be used to alter the representation of ages, names, and proverbs in ways that some people find to be highly amusing. Among other advantages, the representation of people's ages can be altered so that a younger person seems older and an<br>
10	older person seems younger, and the representation of people's names can<br>
be altered so that they appear to come from other cultures and are descriptive of the person. Similarly, the representation of proverbs can be altered so that they appear to concern matters of individualized interest. In a preferred embodiment, the method of the present invention comprises the<br>
15	steps,   using   an   electronic   data   processing   system,   of   inputting   an<br>
expression of age in base 10 notation, converting the expression of age in base 10 notation to an expression of age in an alternate base notation, and outputting the expression of age in the alternate base notation. An alternate preferred embodiment of a method of the present invention comprises the<br>
20	steps, using an electronic data processing system, of inputting an input<br>
name and an input adjective, converting the input name to a cognate form,<br>
converting the input adjective to a synonym, and outputting the cognate form<br>
and the synonym. Another alternate preferred embodiment of a method of<br>
the   present   invention   comprises   the   steps,   using   an   electronic   data<br>
7<br><br>
processing system, of inputting an input phrase and an input adjective, selecting a proverb form corresponding to the input adjective, inserting the input phrase into the proverb form, and outputtind the proverb form with the inserted input phrase.<br>
5	Chinese Patent No. CN1177779 relates to a hand-held Chinese idioms end-<br>
to-end serially-connected computer which comprises two portions of<br>
keyboard with 36 keys and computer whose internal memory includes 2000<br>
Chinese idioms which are end-to-end serially-connected together. When<br>
using, its switch key is pressed, on the screen of computer the first Chinese<br>
10	idiom formed of four Chinese characters can be displayed, then the switch<br>
"Key can be pressed again, the second Chinese idiom can be displayed, then the rest can be done in the same manner, so that said 2000 Chinese idioms can be displayed one-by-one, therefore it is convenient to learn Chinese idioms for people.<br>
15	The  prior art described   in the foregoing descriptions  have  an  inherent<br>
limitation, in that, they do not allow the users to build their own databank of WISDOM BYTES by well-defined classifications, and further that none of the above prior art assist in the improvement of one's knowledge of WISDOM BYTES by allowing users to take Wisdom Bytes Session(s), and that none of<br>
20	the above prior art allow the users to share such WISDOM BYTES with<br>
others.<br>
Therefore,  by dint of determined  research and  intuitive  knowledge, our<br>
inventor has devefoped an interactive System that enables users to build<br>
(including saving, appending, retrieving, modifying) their own databank of<br>
8<br><br>

Operation, System State Transition of the Global Association Module, the<br>
System Function, System Operation, System State Transition of the Global<br>
5	Attachment Module,  respectively of the present invention.  The Wisdom<br>
Bytes Bank Module accepts data in one or more languages (such data capable of being accepted from more than one user at the same time), with or without voice, by well-defined classifications like (1) Date (2) Source of Information (to record the Source from where the user obtained the details<br>
10	the User is entering - EXAMPLE - The User may have read a SAYING etc.<br>
in a particular book or magazine - say "XYZ" and would like to store this Source of Information), (3) Type of WISDOM BYTE (to record the Type of data the user is entering, e.g. adages, aphorisms, dictums, epigrams, expressions,   gospels,   home  truths,   idioms,   mantras,   mottos,   nuggets,<br>
15	phrases,   proverbs,   quotes,   quotations,   sayings,   slogans,   Basic  Truths,<br>
Facts, Feats - EXAMPLE - the data may be in the form of a "ADAGE" like "Look before you Leap" and the user may like to store the same under Type 'ADAGE" ), (3) Subject (to record the Subject under which the data that the user is entering is to be stored - EXAMPLE - The user is entering a FACT<br>
20	which may be a GEOGRAPHICAL FACT and the user may want to store the<br>
FACT under the SUBJECT GEOGRAPHICAL FACTS) (4) Sub Subject(s) (to record the Sub Subject (s) under which the details that the user is entering is to be stored - EXAMPLE - The FACT may be based on a GEOGRAPHICAL SUBJECT and the user may want to store the FACT "Though Mt. Everest is<br>
23<br><br>
called the tallest mountain on earth, Mauna Kea, a volcano on the island of<br>
Hawaii is actually taller", under the SUBJECT GEOGRAPHICAL FACTS and<br>
further classify the same up to 5 levels {Sub-Subjects} e.g. SUBJECT<br>
GEOGRAPHICAL FACTS &gt; SUB-SUBJECT1 &gt; EARTH GEOGRAPHY &gt;<br>
5	SUB-SUBJECT2 &gt;  FEATURES  &gt; SUB-SUBJECT3  &gt;  LAND MASSES  &gt;<br>
SUB-SUBJECT4 &gt; MOUNTAINS &gt; SUB-SUBJECT5 &gt; TALLEST MOUNTAIN. The Module further allows the user to search for existing WISDOM BYTES by none or one or more of the above classifications, in order to avoid the duplication of entries.<br>
10	The Module further allows the user to add the meaning and the origin of the<br>
Wisdom Byte - EXAMPLE - the idiom "FOOD FOR THOUGHT" means " An interesting idea, worth thinking about". This idiom originated in the early 1800s when people associated the mind as a mouth that "chews" ideas, thereby making "ideas" as the "FOOD FOR THOUGHT". The Module further<br>
15	allows the user to Attach and/or Associate any kind of additional information<br>
like File(s), URLs and Remarks, File(s) and URLs being able to be opened by the System, the Remarks being simply displayed - EXAMPLE - The user may want to Attach an IMAGE and/or an ANIMATION and/or a SOUND file to the Record, or the user may also want to "associate" more information to<br>
20	the Record by means of associating some information that may be on a file<br>
or a Web Site, and hence the user would Associate a file or URL to the Record. Such file(s) would be opened by the System. In case of a URL, the same would be opened by the System provided the user is connected to the<br>
24<br><br>
Internet.   The user may also simply wish to add a REMARK to the Record.<br>
Such REMARKS are displayed to the user on demand using a browser.<br>
The System also provides a utility to add specialized Remarks as "Bookmark<br>
Remarks", as well as a utility to Bookmark any selected  Record(s) as<br>
5	"Favourite" and further assign the same to specific users or user groups. A<br>
Global utility allows the user to Bookmark a set of Records as "Favourite" Globally, across multiple Record(s), by finding the same from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND conditions, instead of Bookmarking the same one by one.<br>
10	All of the above classifications and additional details and information are<br>
user defined, and can be modified to suit the user, thereby providing full flexibility to the user.<br>
The System also comprises of the utility, while adding a new data Record, of<br>
copying an existing entry with respect to at least the above classifications<br>
15	under which the entry may have been stored, such "Copy Current Entry"<br>
utility being of immense use to the user to simplify the creation of Records having at least common classifications.<br>
The System also comprises of the utility of Printing a Record stored in the<br>
Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database. The Records can be<br>
20	Printed     by    finding     the     same    from    the    Wisdom     Bytes     Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database based on none or one or more FIND conditions, the Results being displayed to the user in a grid format with a further utility to Sort the Results, Ascending or Descending, by the relevant<br>
25<br><br>
classifications, and further allowing the user to select the Records to be<br>
Printed from the result grid. The Printing utility offers further selections to be<br>
made by the user with respect to various Print conditions such as Printing a<br>
single Record, or Printing the results without further selections, or Printing<br>
5	the results selectively, or Printing the entire set of Records available in the<br>
database  with  further  selections,   if  needed.   The   Printing   utility further<br>
comprises of the Print reports to be Exported to various destinations in<br>
various file formats. The Printing utility provides the user with the ability to<br>
customize the Header and Footer details.<br>
10	The System also comprises of the utility of Navigating between Records in<br>
the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database.<br>
The System comprises of the utility of finding Records in the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more of the above classifications and/or keywords, File Attachments or Bookmark Remarks<br>
15	including, but not limited to, whether the Wisdom Bytes is Bookmarked as<br>
"Favourite", the Find Results being displayed to the user in a grid format with a further utility to Sort the Find Results, Ascending or Descending, by the relevant classifications that may have been used by the user to enter and/or Modify the Records in the Wisdom Bytes Bank Module. Double clicking on<br>
20	any Record will take the user to the concerned Record.<br>
A further utility allows the user to send the Record as SMS/MMS and/or via Email and/or Network Messaging.<br>
26<br><br>
The user is allowed to input and/or Modify data in Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database by Voice input, with or without a conjunction<br>
of input made by keyboard support, and/or use any other<br>
utilities/functionality of the System, as may be supported by the System for<br>
5	such use, by Voice Command, and further that the text to speech technology<br>
used enables the System to speak out the data so entered/modified by the user in the above Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, The Wisdom Bytes Bank Module also accepts data built by another user (Exporting user) of the System, by the above classifications, and which data<br>
10	may be further manipulated by the Importing user to suit the Importing user's<br>
requirements - EXAMPLE - the Exporting user may have classified the subject of the Fact "Though Mt. Everest is called the tallest mountain on earth, Mauna Kea a volcano on the island of Hawaii is actually taller" as GEOGRAPHICAL FACTS, but the Importing user may like to classify the<br>
15	subject of the same as GEOGRAPHY OF NORTH AMERICA.<br>
Any data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database can be deleted by the user by finding the same based on none or one or more FIND conditions.<br>
Any Record can be translated by the user into one or more languages by<br>
20	finding   the   same   from   the   Wisdom   Bytes   Bank   Database/Translation<br>
Database based on none or one or more FIND conditions and translating the same into the selected language.<br>
Any data entered or imported into the Wisdom Bytes Bank Module is further used as part of the functions of the other Modules of the System.<br>

FIG 4 is the diagram of the System Function of the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
Module of the present invention. The architecture of this Module comprises<br>
the following functions, which allow a user to build, append, save, Modify<br>
and Delete WISDOM BYTES by well-defined classifications, and add other<br>
5	details    like    Meanings    and    details    of    Origin    (where    applicable),<br>
Attach/Associate Files/URLs/Remarks, with the help of the User Interface.<br>
The Wisdom Bytes Bank Module through the User Interface causes the Control System to find and retrieve the relevant data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database. The Module allows a user to:<br>
10	â  Find existing data by none or one or more FIND conditions<br>
â 	Sort &amp;Select data<br>
â 	Add, Modify, Delete &amp; Save data by classifications<br>
â 	Translate data<br>
â 	Send data as SMS/MMS and/or Network Messaging and/or via Email 15              â  Copy Current Entry<br>
â 	Print Current Wisdom Byte by different classifications<br>
â 	Go To a Wisdom Byte and Navigate between Wisdom Bytes<br>
â 	Bookmark/Unbookmark Wisdom Bytes with various Remarks, as well as<br>
Bookmark the same as "Favourite"<br>
20	â  Attach/Associate File(s)/URL/Remarks to a Wisdom Byte<br>
FIG 5 describes the System Operation of the Wisdom Bytes Bank Module explaining that the Module is based on user actions, which are performed by loops.<br>
28<br><br>
The Add functionality allows the user to Input data in the relevant fields. The functionality is controlled through a top-level loop. The Control System updates the Database and then the System waits for the next user action.<br>
The Find functionality is controlled through a top-level loop wherein the user<br>
5	is asked to enter/select a find criterion, to bring forth WISDOM BYTE(S) from<br>
the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database based on the Find<br>
criteria. After finding the WISDOM BYTE(S), the user can sort the WISDOM<br>
BYTES etc. by different classifications and then can Modify, Delete or Print<br>
the WISDOM BYTE(S). After Modification, if the user saves the WISDOM<br>
10	BYTE(S), the database gets updated and then the System waits for the next<br>
user action. Similarly, after deleting a WISDOM BYTE(S), the database gets updated and then the System waits for the next user action.<br>
The Copy Current Entry functionality is controlled through a top-level loop.<br>
The System comprises of this utility, while creating a new data Record, of<br>
15	copying an existing entry with respect to at least the above classifications<br>
under which the entry may have been stored, such "Copy Current Entry" utility being of immense use to the user to simplify the creation of Records having at least common classifications - EXAMPLE - If a user has an existing Record classified as:<br>
20	TYPE OF WISDOM BYTE: FACT<br>
SUBJECT: GEOGRAPHICAL FACTS<br>
And the new Record being entered by the User also happens to be falling<br>
under the above classifications, the "Copy Current Entry" would make the<br>
29<br><br>
new entry easier for the user, in that, the user would not have to reclassify the new entry.<br>
The Control System updates the new WISDOM BYTE in the Database and then the System waits for the next user action.<br>
5	The Printing functionality is controlled through a top-level loop. The user can<br>
Print the WISDOM BYTE facing the user, or can Print WISDOM BYTES that<br>
may have been found from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation<br>
Database by a FIND criterion. The Control System retrieves the WISDOM<br>
BYTE(S) from the Database and then the System waits for the next user<br>
10	action.<br>
The Bookmark/Unbookmark WISDOM BYTES functionality is controlled<br>
through a top-level loop. The user can Bookmark/Unbookmark the WISDOM<br>
BYTE facing the user, or can Bookmark/Unbookmark WISDOM BYTE(S)<br>
that may have been found from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
15	Database/Translation Database by a FIND criterion. Bookmarking requires<br>
that the user add some Remarks to the Bookmark. The Control System updates the Database and then the System waits for the next user action. This functionality also allows the user to Bookmark WISDOM BYTES as "Favourite"<br>
20	The Translation functionality is controlled through a top-level loop. The user<br>
can Translate WISDOM BYTE facing the user, or can Translate WISDOM<br>
BYTE(S)   that   may   have   been   found   from   the   Wisdom   Bytes   Bank<br>
Database/Translation   Database   by   a   FIND   criterion.   The   Translation<br>
30<br><br>
functionality allows the user to consider any WISDOM BYTE as a parent language WISDOM BYTE and translate the same into one or more languages of the user's choice. The Control System updates the Database and then the System waits for the next user action.<br>
5	The user can send as SMS/MMS and/or Network Messaging and/or via<br>
Email the WISDOM BYTE facing the user, or can send that may have been found from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database by a FIND criterion.<br>
The user can Attach/Associate file (s) including Image, Animation and/or<br>
10	Sound Files/URL/Remarks to the WISDOM BYTE facing the user, or can<br>
Attach/Associate file (s) including Image, Animation and/or Sound Files,<br>
URLs/Remarks to the WISDOM BYTES that may have been found from the<br>
Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database by a FIND criterion.<br>
The Attach/Associate file (s) including Image, Animation and/or Sound Files,<br>
15	URL/Remarks functionality to a desired WISDOM BYTE(S) is controlled<br>
through a top-level loop. The Control System updates the Database and<br>
then the System waits for the next user action.<br>
The Navigation functionality allows the user to navigate between WISDOM BYTES<br>
20	On giving the Close command the System gets notified and the user comes<br>
out from the Module.<br>
31<br><br>
FIG 6 describes the System State Transition Diagram of the Wisdom Bytes Bank Module explaining that the Module is based on the different States. The System receives events from the user(s), and each event causes the transition from one state to another within the Module.<br>
5	Each  State  contains  its  own  separate Terminal  State.  A  double  lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
10 â  FIG 7 is the diagram of the System Function of Global Association Module of the present invention. The architecture of this Module comprises the following functions, which allow a user to Associate File(s)/URL/Remarks to WISDOM BYTES Globally by finding the WISDOM BYTES from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND<br>
15	conditions with the help of the  User Interface. The Global Association<br>
Module, through the User Interface, causes the Control System to find and retrieve the relevant data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database and to Associate File(s)/URI_s/Remarks to WISDOM BYTES Globally across several selected WISDOM BYTES at a<br>
20	time.<br>
FIG 8 describes the System Operation of Global Association Module explaining that the Module is based on user actions, which are performed by loops. Through this Global Association Module, the user can Associate<br>
32<br><br>
File(s)/URL/Remarks to WISDOM BYTES Globally by finding the WISDOM BYTE(S) from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND conditions with the help of the User Interface.<br>
Once the user finds the WISDOM BYTES from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
5	Database/Translation Database, by various classifications, the user can sort<br>
&amp; select the WISDOM BYTE(S) and then the System waits for the next user action. Then the user can Associate File(s)/URL-s/Remarks to WISDOM BYTES Globally through the User Interface. The System then waits for the next user action.<br>
10	On giving the Close command the System gets notified and the user comes<br>
out from the Module.<br>
FIG   9  describes  the   System   State  Transition   Diagram   of the   Global<br>
Association Module explaining that the Module is based on the different<br>
States. The System  receives events from the user(s), and  each event<br>
15	causes the transition from one state to another within the Module.<br>
Each State contains its own separate Terminal State. A double lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are<br>
possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of<br>
which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line<br>
20	indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
FIG 10 is the diagram of the System Function of Global Attachment Module of the present invention. The architecture of this Module comprises the<br>
33<br><br>
following functions, which allow a user to Attach a File to WISDOM BYTES<br>
Globally by finding the WISDOM BYTE(S) from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND conditions<br>
with the help of the User Interface. The Global Attachment Module, through<br>
5	the User Interface, causes the Control System to find and retrieve the<br>
relevant data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database and to Attach File(s) to the WISDOM BYTES Globally across several selected WISDOM BYTE(S) at a time.<br>
FIG   11   describes the  System  Operation  of Global  Attachment  Module<br>
10	explaining that the Module is based on user actions, which are performed by<br>
loops. Through this Global Attachment Module, the user can Attach File(s) to WISDOM BYTES Globally by finding the WISDOM BYTE(S} from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND conditions with the help of the User Interface.<br>
15	Once the user finds the WISDOM BYTES from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database, by various classifications, the user can sort &amp; select the WISDOM BYTE(S) and then the System waits for the next user action. Then the user can Attach File(s) to WISDOM BYTES Globally through the User Interface. The System then waits for the next user action.<br>
20	On giving the Close command the System gets notified and the user comes<br>
out from the Module.<br>
FIG 12 describes the System State Transition Diagram of the Global Attachment Module explaining that the Module is based on the different<br>
34<br><br>
States. The system receives events from the user(s), and each event causes the transition from one state to another within the Module.<br>
Each  State  contains  its  own  separate  Terminal  State.  A double  lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are<br>
5	possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of<br>
which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
The System generates a new Record Id each time a new entry is made by a user or when a Record is imported by the user.<br>
10	FIGS 13 to 15 explain the System Function, System Operation and System<br>
State Transition respectively, comprises of a Module allowing the user to invoke and store a Wisdom Bytes Session, (such Wisdom Bytes Sessions being capable of being taken by more than one user at the same time), using the data stored  in the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation<br>
15	Database, and by finding the same based on none or one or more FIND<br>
conditions, the find results being displayed to the user with a Timer, the time of display as may be selected by the user, for displaying each of the Records, and the Records being displayed one by one, until the number of Records found by the above FIND conditions are exhausted, or until the<br>
20	user exits the Module, as well as further allowing the user to manually<br>

maintenance and updating of Database.<br>
FlG 42 describes the System State Transition Diagram of the Tools/Help<br>
Menu Options Module explaining that the Module is based on different<br>
States. The System  receives events from the user(s),  and  each event<br>
10	causes the transition from one state to another within the Module.<br>
Each State contains its own separate Terminal State. A double lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are<br>
possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of<br>
which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line<br>
15	indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
FIGS 43 to 48 explain the System Function, System Operation and System<br>
State Transition respectively, of a Translation utility, allowing the user to<br>
consider any Record as a parent language Record and translate the same<br>
into one or more languages of the users choice, the translation activity<br>
20	happening from a Translation Module which is invoked in the Wisdom Bytes<br>
Bank     Module,     and     further     that     all     of     the     features     and/or<br>
utility(s)/functionality(s) of the System remain common to the translated<br>
Record as would be applicable to the parent language Record. There is a<br>
58<br><br>
further utility of "Global Translation" wherein Record(s) can be found and<br>
part(s) of the Record(s) can be translated Globally. The Records can be<br>
translated Globally by finding them from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND conditions,<br>
5	the Results being displayed to the user in a grid format with a further utility to<br>
Sort the Results, Ascending or Descending, by some of the relevant<br>
classifications, and further allowing the user to select the Records to be<br>
Globally translated from the result grid. - EXAMPLE - The user may want<br>
to translate the Subject of some or all WISDOM BYTES having been<br>
10	classified under the Subject GEOGRAPHY from English to Spanish. The<br>
Global utility would permit the user to translate this across multiple Records instead of translating the same one by one.<br>
FIG 43 is the diagram of the System Function of Translation Module of the<br>
present invention. The architecture of this Module comprises the following<br>
15	functions, which allow a user to consider any WISDOM BYTE as a parent<br>
language Record and Translate the same into one or more languages of the user's choice.<br>
The Translation  Module through the User Interface causes the Control<br>
System to find and retrieve the relevant data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
20	Database/Translation Database. The Module allows a user to:<br>
- Find    existing    WISDOM    BYTE(S)   from   the   Wisdom    Bytes    Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database by none or one or more FIND conditions â  Sort &amp; Select WISDOM BYTE(S)<br>
59<br><br>
â 	Select/Add a language<br>
â 	Add Translations<br>
â 	Modify Translations<br>
â 	Delete Translations 5              â  Print<br>
FIG 44 describes the System Operation of Translation Module explaining that the Module is based on user actions, which are performed by loops. The user finds the WISDOM BYTE(S) from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database, by none or one or more FIND conditions.<br>
10	The user then sorts &amp; selects the WISDOM BYTES and the System then<br>
waits for the aext user action. Then the user selects a WISDOM BYTE(S) to be translated and translates the same, field by field, through the User Interface. The user can also Modify an earlier translation or Delete the same. The System then waits for the next user action. The user is able to<br>
15	Print the  Record from this Module after selecting the appropriate Print<br>
criterion. The System then waits for the next user action.<br>
On giving the Close command the System gets notified and the user comes out from the Module.<br>
FIG 45 describes the System State Transition Diagram of the Translation<br>
20	Module explaining that the Module is based on different States. The System<br>
receives events from the user(s), and each event causes the transition from one state to another within the Module.<br>
60<br><br>
Each State contains its own separate Terminal State. A double lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are<br>
possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of<br>
which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line<br>
5	indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
FIG 46 is the diagram of the System Function of Global Translation Module<br>
of the present invention. The architecture of this Module comprises the<br>
following functions, which allow a user to translate a selected part of the<br>
parent language WISDOM BYTE(S)across several WISDOM BYTES etc.<br>
10	Globally in any language of the user's choice.<br>
The Global Translation Module through the User Interface causes the Control System to find and retrieve the relevant data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database by none or one or more FIND conditions. The Module allows a user to:<br>
15	â  Find existing WISDOM BYTES by none or one or more FIND conditions<br>
â 	Sort &amp; Select WISDOM BYTES<br>
â 	Select/Add a language<br>
â 	Select part for Global Translation<br>
â 	Translate Globally<br>
20	FIG  47 describes the  System  Operation  of Global Translation  Module<br>
explaining that the Module is based on user actions.<br>
Once the user finds the WISDOM BYTES from the Wisdom Bytes Bank<br>
Database/Translation Database by none or one or more FIND conditions,<br>
61<br><br>
the user can sort &amp; select the WISDOM BYTES and the System then waits<br>
for the next user action. Then the user can select part of the WISDOM<br>
BYTES and translate the same across multiple WISDOM BYTES through<br>
the User Interface, instead of translating the same one by one. The System<br>
5	then waits for the next user action.<br>
On giving the Close command the System gets notified and the user comes out from the Module.<br>
FIG 48  describes the  System  State Transition   Diagram  of the  Global<br>
Translation Module explaining that the Module is based on different States.<br>
10	The System receives events from the user(s), and each event causes the<br>
transition from one state to another within the Module.<br>
Each  State  contains  its  own  separate Terminal   State.  A double  lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are<br>
possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of<br>
15	which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line<br>
indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
FIGS 49 to 51 explain the System Function, System Operation and System<br>
State Transition respectively, of a Master Module which accepts data (such<br>
data capable of being accepted from more than one user at the same time),<br>
20	with or without Voice, from the user. The System provides the utility of<br>
creating, editing, deleting, printing, navigating, finding Masters like; User, Source  of  Information,   Type,   Subject  &amp;   Sub   subjects,   Language  with<br>
62<br><br>
sufficient security, so as not to allow the deletion of any Master of a Record that may be in use.<br>
FIG 49 is the diagram of the System Function of Master Module of the<br>
present invention. The architecture of this Module comprises the following<br>
5	functions, which allow a user to create and store Masters with the help of the<br>
User Interface.<br>
The Master Module through the User Interface causes the Control System to retrieve the relevant data from the Wisdom Bytes Bank Database/Translation Database. The Module allows a user to:<br>
10	â  Find existing Master(s) by none or one or more FIND conditions<br>
-	Sort &amp; Select Master(s)<br>
-	Add &amp; Save Master(s)<br>
-	Modify &amp; Save Master(s)<br><br>
â 	Delete Master(s) 15              â  Copy Current Entry<br>
â 	Print Master(s)<br>
â 	Go To a Master<br>
FIG 50 describes the System Operation of the Master Module explaining that the Module is based on user actions, which are performed by loops.<br>
20	The Add functionality allows the user to Input data in all the fields. The<br>
functionality is controlled through a top-level loop. The Control System updates the Database and the System then waits for the next user action.<br>
63<br><br>
The FIND functionality is controlled through a top-level loop wherein the user<br>
is asked to enter/select the find criteria, to bring forth Masters based on the<br>
FIND criteria. After finding the Masters, the user can sort the Masters by<br>
different classifications and can then Modify, Delete or Print the Masters.<br>
5	After Modification, if the user saves the Master, the database gets updated<br>
and the System then waits for the next user action. Similarly, after deleting a Master, the database gets updated and the System then waits for the next user action.<br>
The Copy Current Entry functionality is controlled through a top-level loop.<br>
10	This functionality allows the user to copy the data existing in one or more of<br>
the fields of the current Master and make the necessary Additions/Modifications in the other fields. The Control System updates the new Master in the Database and the System then waits for the next user action.<br>
15	The Printing functionality is controlled through a top-level loop. The user can<br>
Print the Masters. The Control System retrieves the Master(s) from the Database and then the System waits for the next user action.<br>
The Navigation functionality allows the user to navigate between Masters.<br>
On giving the Close command the System gets notified and the user comes<br>
20	out from the Module.<br>
FIG 51 describes the System State Transition Diagram of the Master Module explaining  that the   Module   is   based  on  different  States.   The  System<br>
64<br><br>
receives events from the user(s), and each event causes the transition from one state to another within the module.<br>
Each  State  contains   its  own  separate  Terminal  State.   A  double  lined<br>
transition arrow from State 4 indicates that multiple instances of the state are<br>
5	possible. So it is possible for multiple instances of state 4 to occur, each of<br>
which has its own Terminal State. A transition shown with a dotted line indicates that it is leaving from one State and entering another state.<br>
