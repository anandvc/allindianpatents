				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pesticidal composition that is suitable for controlling insects and/or representatives of the order Acarina and microorganisms, especially phytopathogenic fungi, comprising (a) at least one insecticide and (b) at least three fungicides. The pesticidal composition is particularly suitable for the protection of plant propagation materials.<br>
Certain mixtures of active ingredients for controlling pests are described in the literature. The biological properties of those known mixtures are not entirely satisfactory in the area of pest control, toxicity, pest resistance and loading rates. The protection of plant propagation materials (seed treatments) with pesticides are target applications which partially address the need for a reduction of environmental and worker exposure and pest resistance buildup when used alone or in conjunction with foliar or furrow pesticide applications. However, there is also a need to make available other mixtures which reduce the need for older acutely toxic insecticides and to reduce loading rates. Among the older insecticides, the following may be mentioned: tefluthrin, cypermethrin, thiodicarb, lindane, furathiocarb, acephate, butocarboxim, carbofuran, NTN, endosulfan, diethion, aldoxycarb, methiocarb, oftanol, (isofenphos), chlorpyrifos, bendiocarb, benfuracarb, oxamyl, parathion, capfos, dimethoate, fonofos, chlorfenvinphos, cartap, fenthion, fenitrothion, HCH, deltamethrin, malathion, disulfoton. Accordingly, there is a need to provide pesticide compositions and methods for the protection of plant propagation materials, especially those compositions having improved biological properties, for example synergistic pesticidal properties, especially for controlling insects and representatives of the order Acarina and microorganisms. That problem is solved according to the invention by the provision of the present at least quaternary pesticidal composition.<br>
The present invention provides an at least quaternary composition for controlling insects or representatives of the order Acarina and microorganisms, which composition comprises: (A)<br><br>
.east one insecticidally or acaricidally active compound, and (B) at least three fungicidally active compounds.<br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds (I) to (II) are capable of forming acid addition salts. Those salts are formed, for example, with strong inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, nitrous acid, a phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, d^alkanecarboxylic acids, for example acetic acid, saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric or phthalic acid, hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, or benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, CrC4alkane- or aryl-sulfonic acids, for example methane- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid. Furthermore, compounds of formula (I) or (II) having at least one acidic group are capable of forming salts with bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl-, diethyl-, triethyl- or dimethyl-propyl-amine, or a mono-, di- or tri-hydroxy-lower alkylamine, for example mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine. In addition, corresponding internal salts may also be formed. Preference is given within the scope of the invention to agrochemically advantageous salts. In view of the close relationship between the compounds of formula (I) and (II) in free form and in the form of their salts, any reference hereinbefore or hereinafter to the free compounds of formula (I) and (II) or to their respective salts is to be understood as including also the corresponding salts or the free compounds of formula (I) and (II), where appropriate and expedient. The same applies in the case of tautomers of compounds of formula (I) and (II) and the salts thereof. The free form is generally preferred in each case.<br><br><br>

A.I. Combination<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the combination of the active ingredients (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3) results in a quite unexpectedly enhanced action against insects or representatives of the order Acarina and microorganisms such as seed-borne and soil-borne fungi and/or provides other unexpected advantages when used in connection with plant propagation materials. The increase in action and/or other advantageous properties achieved with the combination according to the invention is significantly greater than the activity to be expected by the four individual components, i.e. the activity is enhanced synergistically which, inter alia, extends the boundaries of the pesticidal activity of the compounds.<br>
In particular, it has now been found, surprisingly, that, for example, the pesticidal activity of the compositions according to the invention, compared with the pesticidal activity of the individual components, is not merely additive, as may essentially be expected, but that a synergistic effect exists. The term "synergistic" is not, however, in any way limited in this context to the pesticidal activity, but refers equally to other advantageous properties of the compositions according to the invention as compared with the individual components. Examples of such advantageous properties that may be mentioned are: a broadening of the spectrum of pesticidal activity to other pests, for example to resistant strains; a reduction in the rate of application of the active ingredients; adequate control of the pests with the aid of the compositions according to the invention, even at a rate of application at which the individual compounds are totally ineffective; advantageous behavior during formulating and/or upon application, for example upon grinding, sieving, emulsifying, dissolving or dispersing; increased storage stability; improved stability to light; more advantageous degradability; improved toxicological and/or ecotoxicological behavior; improved crop characteristics including: emergence, crop yields, more developed root system, tillering increase, increase in plant height, bigger leaf blade, less dead basal leaves, stronger tillers,-greener leaf color, less fertilizers needed, less seeds needed, more productive tillers, earlier flowering, early grain maturity, less plant verse (lodging), increased shoot growth, improved plant vigor, and early germination; or any other advantages familiar to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
In the area of pest control, the compositions according to the invention are valuable reductive (reducing the occurrence of a pest), preventive and/or curative active ingredients having a very advantageous biocidal spectrum even at low rates of concentration, while being well tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish and plants. The compositions of the invention are effective against all or individual development stages of normally sensitive animal pests, but also of resistant animal pests, such as insects and representatives of the order Acarina, and phytopathogenic fungi. The insecticidal, acaricidal and/or fungicidal action of the compositions of the invention may manifest itself directly, i.e. in the mortality of the pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during molting, or indirectly, for example in reduced oviposition and/or a reduced hatching rate, the good activity corresponding to a mortality of at least 50 to 60 %.<br>
Advantageous mixing ratios of the at least four active ingredients are (A):(B1):(B2):(B3)=(250 to 50):(5to l):(2to l):(20to 1), in particular (A):(B1):(B2):(B3)=(200 to 60):(3 to 1):( 1.5 to 1):( 10 to 1) and very particularly (A):(B1):(B2):(B3)=( 160 to 120):(3 to2):(1.2to l):(10to4). Other advantageous mixing ratios are (A):(B 1 ):(B2):(B3)=( 160):(3):( 1 ):(9.6), or (120):(2):( 1 ):(4.8).<br>
The active ingredient combinations according to the invention preferably comprise a compound of formula (I) to (II), especially of the formula (I), more especially of the formula (la), and metalaxyl, fludioxonil and difenoconazole.<br>
Preference is given especially to an active ingredient combination comprising the compound of formula (la), metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil and difenoconazole in a mixing ratio of (160):(3):(1):(9.6) or (260):(7.5):(2):(16) or (400g):(7.5g):(2.5g):(24g).<br>
The above-mentioned mixing ratios relate on the one hand to parts by weight of the individual components, but on the other hand also to the mixing ratios in moles. Thus, for example, with respect to the previous paragraph the ratio of (250 to 50):(1):(1):(1) denotes from about 250 to about fifty parts by weight of a compound of formula (la) to one part by weight of a each of metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil and difenoconazole; but also from about 250 to about fifty moles of a compound of formula (la) to one mole of a each of the compounds metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil and difenoconazole. In addition, it will be understood that 1 part by weight may equal the actual<br><br>
weight of the active component with the lowest loading. For example, a mixing ratio of (160):(3):(1):(9.6) parts would equal the ratio (400g):(7.5g):(2.5g):(24g) in grams (wherein 2.5 grams is considered "1 part"). Finally, the figures relate also to mixtures in the ratio of the LD50 values of the individual pests to be controlled.<br>
Fungal Pests<br>
The compositions according to the invention are especially active against fungi, in particular of the oomycetes which belong to the class of phycomycetes (e.g., phytophthora, peronospora, pseudoperonospora, pythium sp. or plasmopara), basidiomycete, ascomycete, adelomycete or Fungi Imperfecti type, such as Botrytis cinerea, Erysiphe graminis, Puccinia graminis, Puccinia recondita, Piricularia oryzae, Cercosoora beticola, Puccinia striiformis, Erysiphe cichoracearum, Rhinchosporium secalis, Fusarium, Solani, Fusarium oxysporum (e.g. melonis), Pyrenophora avenae, Septoria tritici, Septoria avenae, Whetzelinia sclerotiorum, Mycosohaerella fijiensis, Alternaria solani, Aspergillus niger, Cercospora arachidicola, Cladosporium herbarum, Tilletia caries, Tilletia contreversa, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium nivale, Helminthosporium oryzae, Helminthosporium teres, Helminthosporium gramineum, Helminthosporium sativum, Penicillium expansum, Pestalozzia sp, Phoma betae, Phoma foveata, Phoma lingam, Ustilago maydis, Ustilago nuda, Ustilago hordei, Ustilago avenae, Verticillium dahliae, Ascochyta pisi, Guignardia bidwellii, Corticium rolfsii, Phomposis viticola, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotinia minor, Coryneum cardinale, Rhizoctonia solani, Acrostalagmus koningi, Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Corticium rolfsii, Diplodia natalensis, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Gibberella fujikuroi, Hormodendron cladosporioides, Myrothecium verrucaria, Paecylomyces varioti, Pellicularia sasakii, Phellinus megaloporus, Sclerotium rolfsii, Stachybotris atra, Trichoderma pseudokoningi, Trichothecium roseum.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are particularly suited for the reductive, preventive and the curative protection of the plant propagation material against fungi and fungal diseases including: damping off (e.g., Fusarium sp., Pythium sp., Rhizoctonia sp.), root rot (e.g., Pythium sp., Fusarium sp., Gibberella sp.), and seed or soil borne blackleg (Leptosphaeria maculans) diseases of vegetable organisms and plants in general, and especially of oil seed crops such as canola (rape), mustard seed, and hybrids thereof, and also rice and maize.<br><br>

(sugar beet and fodder beet), oil plants (canola, rape, mustard seed, poppy, olives, sunflowers,<br>
coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts and soya).<br>
In addition, the crops listed in the crop group tables in 40 CFR Sec. 180.41 (1995) are noted. 40 CFR Sec. 180.41 (1995) and the Federal Register: May 17, 1995 (vol. 60, no. 95) pp. 26625 -26643 are fully incorporated by reference herein for their disclosure relating to useful crop plants:<br>
(1)	Crop Group 5: Brassica (Cole) Leafy Vegetables Group, for example, broccoli, cauliflower; cabbage; and mustard greens;<br>
(2)	Crop Group 9: Cucurbit Vegetables Group, for example, cucumber, muskmelon and summer squash;<br>
(3)	Crop Group 11: Pome Fruits Group, for example, apple and pear;<br>
(4)	Crop Group 15: Cereal Grains Group, for example, corn and rice.<br>
The following plants are to regarded as being particularly suitable target crops for the at least quaternary pesticide compositions of the invention: plant propagation materials (such as seeds) of oil plants (canola, rape, mustard seed, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts).<br>
Seed Treatment<br>
The at least quaternary pesticidal composition according to the invention has proved especially advantageous for protecting seeds, in particular, oil seeds such as canola. However, the inventive composition is also suitable for direct treatment of the soil or of other parts of the plant. The inventive composition is well tolerated by plants, and is ecologically acceptable.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a method for protecting the multiplication products of plants (plant propagation materials) and the plants resulting therefrom against insects and fungal<br><br>
diseases, wherein the said multiplication products are coated with an insecticidal and fungicidal and non-phytotoxic composition according to the invention.<br>
The at least quaternary pesticidal composition according to the invention is usually employed together with the adjuvants customary in formulation technology. The combination of the active ingredients (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3) are normally applied to plant propagation material in the form of compositions, but also can be applied to the seed or to the locus of propagation thereof (such as a furrow), simultaneously or in succession, with further compounds. These further compounds can be fertilizers or micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. They can also be selective herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, insect growth regulators, plant growth regulators, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of these preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of formulation.<br>
This invention also includes suitable agricultural compositions for controlling insects and fungi on or in seed consisting essentially of at least quaternary pesticidal composition of this invention plus a suitable inert surfactant or an suitable inert liquid or a solid carrier. As used herein, the phrase "consisting essentially of does not exclude the presence of other active pesticidal materials or conventional formulating ingredients.<br>
The active components (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3) are processed in known manner to give, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, suspoemulsions, spreadable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and also for encapsulation in, for example, polymeric substances. The application methods, such as spraying, misting, atomising, broadcasting, brushing or pouring, and the nature of the composition are adapted to suit the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances. In general, favorable rates of application are 0.0005 to not more than 0.5 kg, in particular 0.001-0.03 kg of each active ingredient (Bl), (B2) and (B3) per 100 kg of material to be protected. With respect to the active ingredient (A), the favorable rates of application can range from 0.005 to not more than 1 kg, in particular 0.01-0.8 kg, more particularly 0.1-0.5 kg per 100 kg of material to be protected. However, the application conditions depend essentially on the nature (surface area, consistency, moisture content) of the material and on its environmental factors. Accordingly, within these ranges, those skilled in the art will choose, on the basis of their general body of<br><br>
knowledge and, where appropriate, a few experiments, doses which are non-phytotoxic but effective from a fungicidal and/or insecticidal standpoint.<br>
The term "plant propagation material" is understood to denote al the generative parts of the plant such as seeds which can be used for the multiplication of the latter and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (for example potatoes). There may be mentioned, e.g., the seeds (in the strict sense), roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, parts of plants. Germinated plants and young plants which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from the soil, may also be mentioned. These young plants may be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion.<br>
Also within the scope of the present invention, storage goods which can be protected with the mixture according to the invention, in particular plant propagation material, especially seeds, will be understood as meaning natural substances of vegetable and/or animal origin and their processing products for which long-term protection is desired, for example the plants and parts thereof, which are mentioned below (stalks, leaves, tubers, seeds, fruits, grains) which have been taken from the natural life cycle and which exist in the freshly harvested state or in processed form (pre-dried, moistened, comminuted, ground, pressed, roasted, etc.). Also falling within the scope of the invention is the protection of timber, whether in the form of crude timber (construction timber, electricity pylons, barriers) or in the form of finished articles (furniture, objects made from wood). Natural products of animal origin which are to be preserved, for example hides, furs, hairs and the like, likewise fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
The techniques of seed treatment application are well known to those skilled in the art, and they may be used readily in the context of the present invention. The active ingredients can be formulated and applied as a slurry, a solid seed coating, a soak, or as a dust on the surface of the seed. There also may be mentioned, e.g., film-coating or encapsulation. The coating processes are well known in the art, and employ, for seeds, the techniques of film-coating or encapsulation, or for the other multiplication products, the techniques of immersion. Needless to say, the method of application of the compounds to the seed may be varied and the invention is intended to include any technique which is to be used.<br><br>
A preferred method of applying the mixture according to the invention consists in spraying or wetting the plant propagation material with a liquid preparation, or mixing the plant material with a solid preparation of the active ingredients.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be formulated or mixed in the seed treater tank or combined on the seed by overcoating with other seed treating agents. The agents to be mixed with the compounds of this invention may be for the control of pests, modification of growth, nutrition, or for the control of plant diseases.<br>

The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or combinations containing the active<br>
ingredients (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3), as well as, if appropriate, suitable inert solid or liquid<br>
carriers, are prepared in a known manner, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the<br>
active ingredients with inert, agriculturally-acceptable extenders, for example with solid or liquid<br>
carriers and, if appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants). Such compositions may be<br>
advantageously formulated as flowable compositions, suspensions, microsuspensions,<br>
suspoemulsions, wettable powders, granulated concentrates, microemulsions and the like, all of<br>
which lend themselves to seed treatment application and provide the requisite plant protection.<br>
The term "carrier" in the present description denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic material with which the active substance is combined in order to facilitate its application to the plant, to the seeds or to the soil. This carrier is hence generally inert, and it must be agriculturally acceptable, in particular to the plant being treated. The carrier may be solid (clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers, and the like) or liquid (water, alcohols, ketones, petroleum fractions, aromatic or paraffinic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, liquefied gases, and the like).<br>
Suitable liquid carriers are: aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular the fractions Cg to Q2, such as xylene mixtures or substituted naphthalenes, phthalic esters such as dibutly or dioctyl phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, alcohols and glycols as well as their ethers and esters, such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide, and, if appropriate, epoxidized vegetable oils or soybean oil; or water.<br><br>
Solid carriers which may be used, for example for dusts and dispersible powders, are calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite, highly-disperse silica or absorptive polymers. Possible particulate, adsorptive carriers for granules are pumice, crushed brick, sepiolite or bentonite, montmorillonite-type clay, and possible nonsorbent carrier materials are calcite or dolomite.<br>
Suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties, depending on the nature of the active ingredients (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3) to be formulated. Surfactants will also be understood as meaning mixtures of surfactants.<br>
The surfactants customarily employed in formulation technology are described, inter alia, in the<br>
following publications:<br>
"McCutcheon"s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publishing Corp., Glen Rock, N.J.,<br>
1988.<br>
M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol. I-III, Chemical Publishing Co., New York,<br>
1980-1981.<br>
Among the suitable surfactants there may be mentioned, e.g., polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or (mono- or di-alkyl)naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, laurylsulfate salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with lignosulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols such as mono- and di-(polyoxyalkylene alkylphenol) phosphates, polyoxyalkylene alkylphenol carboxylates or polyoxyalkylene alkylphenol sulfates), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyltaurides), polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phosphated tristyrylphenols and polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phosphoric esters of alcohols or phenols. The presence of at least one surfactant is often required because the active substance and/or the inert vehicle are not soluble in water and the carrier agent for the application is water.<br>
t<br>
Furthermore, particularly useful adjuvants which enhance application are natural or synthetic phospholipids from the series of the cephalins and lecithins, for example phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerine or lysolecithin.<br><br>
The agrochemical compositions generally contain: 0.1 to 99%, in particular 9 to 50%, more particularly 20 to 25% of the active substances (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3); the balance of the formulation comprising a solid and/or liquid carrier along with optional surfactant(s) and other optional inert ingredients known in the art such as, e.g., protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrating agents, preservatives, stabilizers, antifoaming agents, antifreeze agents, sequestering agents, dyes, pigments, colorings and polymers.<br>
In one embodiment, commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates whereas the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
Formulation Examples (% = per cent by weight)<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the invention, "active ingredient" being understood as meaning a mixture of the active substances (A), (Bl), (B2) and (B3) in a particular mixing ratio of (A):(B1):(B2):(B3)=(160 to 120):(3 to 2):(1.2 to 1):(10 to 4).<br><br>
