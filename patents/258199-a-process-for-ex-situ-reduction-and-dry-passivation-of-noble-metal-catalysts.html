				<td>EX-SITU REDUCTION AND DRY PASSIVATION<br>
OF NOBLE METAL CATALYSTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to methods for the ex-situ activation<br>
and passivation of catalysts. In particular, these methods relate to supported<br>
noble metal catalysts on meso-porous or zeolitic materials. These techniques<br>
also apply to all catalyst that absorb water and use supported noble metals.<br>
[0002] In-situ nitrogen drying and hydrogen reduction of noble metal<br>
catalysts is sometimes difficult to implement in commercial plants. Catalysts<br>
must first be completely dried under inert gas (N2) and then the water partial<br>
pressure must be maintained at extremely low levels during hydrogen reduction<br>
to prevent damaging highly dispersed noble metals. Commercial plants have a<br>
variety of treat gas compositions and limits on minimum operating pressures and<br>
purge gas rates. Therefore, for large catalyst volumes, in-situ activation can last<br>
for weeks and the success relies heavily on accurate treat gas dew point<br>
measurements, which can be quite unreliable. Also, Nitrogen for drying is not<br>
always available and the large volumes needed for adequate drying may be<br>
prohibitively expensive to purchase.<br>
[0003] Ex-situ reduction and dry passivation eliminate the need for<br>
extensive in-situ treatment. This reduces start-up time and eliminates the<br>
potential to damage noble metal dispersion during commercial in-situ reduction<br>
in the presence of moisture.<br>
[0004] Currently, most noble metal catalysts are loaded into the reactor with<br>
the metal in the oxide form and then the noble metals are activated/reduced insitu<br>
in the commercial unit. As mentioned above, in-situ activations can last for<br>
weeks and the presence of excessive moisture during reduction can significantly<br>
damage noble metal dispersion. For limited applications, the noble metals are<br>
activated ex-situ and the reduced catalyst is immediately immersed into excess<br>
oil, wax or liquids, in an inert atmosphere, to passivate the noble metals.<br>
However, catalysts immersed in excess liquid are very difficult to handle and<br>
impossible to load into most multi-bed reactors.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The present invention is a process for the ex-situ reduction and dry<br>
passivation of a supported noble metal catalyst including a mesoporous or<br>
zeolitic matrix. The process includes the steps of reducing the catalyst and<br>
passivating the catalyst in the absence of excess liquid. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the reduced catalyst is first cooled, in an inert atmosphere, and then<br>
exposed to air. In another preferred embodiment, the pores of the reduced<br>
catalyst may be filled with oil in an inert atmosphere. Since only the pores are<br>
filled with oil, the catalyst remains dry and free flowing.<br>
[0006] In a preferred embodiment, the supported metal catalyst is palladium<br>
and platinum supported on MCM-41 bound with alumina, which is described in<br>
U.S. 5,098,684.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011] The present invention is a method of ex-situ activation and dry<br>
passivation of supported noble metal catalysts. The method comprises a two<br>
step procedure. First, the supported noble metal oxides are first dried and<br>
reduced in a single step in the presence of a mixture of hydrogen and inert gas.<br>
Second, the reduced catalyst is dry passivated by cooling in an inert atmosphere<br>
and then exposing to air or by filling the pores of the catalyst with a ultra low<br>
sulfur mineral oil before exposing to air. The passivated catalysts are dry and<br>
free flowing and can be easily loaded into a commercial reactor, heated in<br>
hydrogen to remove free water &amp; oxygen of passivation, and then started on oil<br>
feed, without any further treatment.<br>
[0012] Ex-situ reduction and passivation will reduce start-up time and<br>
eliminates the potential to damage noble metal dispersion during in-situ<br>
reduction in the presence of moisture. While ex-situ passivation of reduced<br>
catalysts in excess oil or wax has been practiced commercially, dry passivation<br>
with air or by oil-pore filling is novel and offers the advantage of a free flowing<br>
catalyst. Further, pilot plant data show that ex-situ reduced and dry passivated<br>
catalysts have equivalent performance as catalysts having been subjected to a<br>
controlled in-situ drying and reductions step using completely dry gases. The<br>
method described in the examples below is for palladium and platinum<br>
supported on MCM-41 bound with alumina.<br>
Example 1: In-Situ Reduction<br>
[0013] The catalyst comprises 0.3 wt% platinum and 0.9 wt% palladium<br>
supported on MCM-41 bound with alumina. Platinum and palladium are highly<br>
dispersed on the surface of the catalyst support by first absorbing onto the<br>
support an aqueous solution of platinum and palladium tetrammine nitrate. After<br>
metals coating, the support is dried and then calcined in air to decompose the<br>
tetrammines, leaving behind finely dispersed platinum and palladium oxides.<br>
Prior to use, the catalyst must be activated by reducing the platinum and<br>
palladium oxides without damaging metal dispersion.<br>
[0014] Current practice is to load such noble metal catalysts into the<br>
commercial reactor and first dry the catalyst in nitrogen and then reduce the<br>
noble metals in hydrogen. As shown in the Table 1 below, the catalyst must be<br>
completely dried in inert gas such as nitrogen prior to reduction and water partial<br>
pressure must be maintained at extremely low levels during hydrogen reduction<br>
to prevent damaging the dispersion of the noble metals, while the temperature<br>
must be at least 150°C to fully reduce the noble metals.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0015] For some limited applications, the noble metals can be reduced exsitu<br>
and the reduced catalysts immediately immersed into excess oil, wax, or<br>
other liquid (in an inert atmosphere) to passivate the noble metals. However,<br>
catalysts immersed in excess liquid are very difficult to handle and are only<br>
useful for single bed reactors because they are impossible to load into most<br>
multi-bed reactors.<br>
Example 2: Ex-Situ Reduction and Passivation<br>
[0016] In ex-situ reduction, the supported noble metal oxides are first dried<br>
and reduced in a single step in the presence of a mixture of hydrogen and inert<br>
gas in a rotary calciner. As shown in Table 2, oxygen chemisorption results on<br>
the nitrogen blanketed samples following ex-situ reduction in a rotary calciner<br>
show that the catalyst was fully reduced with no agglomeration of noble metals.<br>
[0017] The air-passivated catalyst was prepared by cooling the reduced<br>
catalyst in nitrogen and then slowly exposing the reduced catalyst to air at room<br>
temperature. In this step, oxygen is absorbed onto the catalyst surface preventing<br>
oxidation of the reduced noble metals. Oxygen chemisorption measurement<br>
(0.01 O/M) shown in Table 2 indicates that the noble metal sites are covered<br>
with oxygen. Further, chemisorption experiments also indicate that the oxide<br>
coating can be easily removed at very mild conditions (&gt;35°C in hydrogen) to<br>
expose fully reduced and highly dispersed, active noble metal sites.<br>
[0018] The oil pore-filled passivated catalyst was prepared, under inert gas<br>
(N2), using a oil pore-filled passivation technique. In this case, medicinal grade<br>
white oil was added to the reduced catalyst to fill about 95% of the pores<br>
volume. Reduced catalyst samples passivated with oil could not be analyzed by<br>
oxygen chemisorption.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3: Evaluation of Ex-situ Reduced and Dry Passivated Catalysts<br>
[0019] The reduced and passivated catalyst samples from Example 2 were<br>
loaded into a pilot plant reactor and the performance of each catalyst was<br>
evaluated for hydrofmishing a hydrotreated 600N dewaxed oil. The dewaxed oil<br>
was previously hydrotreated to reduce the sulfur content to about 200 wppm.<br>
 [0020] Approximately 5 cc of three, ex-situ reduced and passivated noble<br>
metal catalysts were loaded into an upflow micro-reactor. These included noble<br>
metal catalysts that were all ex-situ reduced and passivated by (1) immersion in<br>
excess oil, as currently practiced, (2) exposure to ambient air or (3) pore filing<br>
with mineral oil. The catalysts were heated to 150°C in hydrogen with 2 psi<br>
water partial pressure, simulating a typical commercial start-up with recycled<br>
hydrogen and treat gas scrubbing. Oil feed was then started and operating<br>
conditions were adjusted to 2 LHSV, 1000 psig, and 2,500 scf/bbl. Reactor<br>
temperature was increased to 275°C and then held constant for about 7-10 days.<br>
Hydrogen purity was 100% and no gas recycle was used.<br>
[0021] For comparison, a sample of commercial catalyst was reduced insitu,<br>
and performance was then evaluated for hydrofinishing the same 600N<br>
dewaxed oil. In this case, the catalyst was loaded using the same procedure and<br>
then dried in nitrogen at 260°C, cooled to room temperature, reduced in dry<br>
hydrogen at about 260°C, and then cooled to 150°C. This sequence represents a<br>
"best case" for a perfect in-situ reduction of the noble metal catalyst. Then oil<br>
feed was introduced and operating conditions were adjusted as described above.<br>
[0022] Product quality as defined by aromatics, sulfur, and nitrogen<br>
contents was monitored daily. Aromatics were measured by UV absorption<br>
(mmoles/kg). Total aromatics as a function of time on stream are shown in<br>
Figure 1. As shown, the initial aromatic saturation (arosat) performance of all<br>
ex-situ hydrogen reduced and passivated catalysts are equivalent to, or better<br>
than, the in-situ reduced catalyst. Further, the samples that were ex-situ reduced<br>
and dry passivated, either with air or by filling the pores with oil, had better<br>
aromatic saturates performance than the ex-situ reduced sample that was<br>
passivated by immersion in white oil.<br>
Advantage of Dry Oil Over Air Passivated<br>
 [0023] The example below compares the performance of the two dry<br>
passivated catalysts of Example 2, air and oil pore-filled to protect the reduced<br>
noble metals, under more severe start-up conditions. In addition to passivation<br>
of the reduced metals, the oil pore-filled technique also offers the advantage of<br>
minimizing water adsorption by the catalyst during storage and handling, and<br>
therefore reducing water evolution during start-up and further mitigating the risk<br>
for metal sintering.<br>
[0024] Hydrotreated dewaxed oil was used as the process feedstcock for<br>
catalyst evaluation. This oil is a dewaxed oil (-18°C) containing traces level of<br>
sulfur (4.7 wppm) and approximately 5.5 wt% aromatics (124 mmol/kg).<br>
Example 4: Oxide Catalyst<br>
[0025] The wet-gases treatment on the oxide catalyst was a base case<br>
against which air and oil passivated catalyst performance was compared. The<br>
noble metal catalyst in its oxide state was subjected to a drying step (140°C) and<br>
a reduction step (220°C) with wet gases containing about 2.2 psia water partial<br>
pressure. Previous studies have shown that under these reduction conditions<br>
metal sintering will occur resulting in a lower performing catalyst.<br>
[0026] Towards the end of the wet gases treatment, and as the unit<br>
conditions were changed, the catalyst was subjected to an increase in water<br>
partial pressure to 3.5 psia for about 1 hour, at 150°C, prior to switching to dry<br>
hydrogen. The unit pressure was then slowly increased to 2000 psig operating<br>
pressure, and the dewaxed oil was introduced. Subsequently, reactor temperature<br>
was increased to the operating temperature of 220°C.<br>
[0027] In addition, catalyst performance was again compared to the<br>
performance of the oxide catalyst that was dried and reduced using the<br>
conventional pilot plant start-up with dry-gases. This catalyst was dried in N2 at<br>
150°C and reduced in H2 at 250°C for 8 hours.<br>
 [0028] As expected, treatment of the oxide catalyst with wet gases resulted<br>
in a lower performing catalyst than that for the dry treatment. The oxide wet and<br>
dry gases treated catalyst performances are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 2.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 5: Air and Oil Pore-Filled Passivated Catalysts<br>
[0029] The air and oil pore-filled reduced and passivated catalysts were all<br>
subjected to wet-gas treatment. Two reactors were loaded with the airpassivated<br>
catalyst. One catalyst was subjected to a 2 hours drying step (140°C)<br>
and a 16 hours reduction step (140°C) with wet gases containing about 1-psia<br>
water partial pressure. The second air-passivated catalyst was directly reduced<br>
with wet hydrogen at 140°C for 16 hours, eliminating the drying step.<br>
[0030] Two other reactors were loaded with the oil pore-filled passivated<br>
catalyst in, either extrudates or crush form. The two reactors were maintained<br>
under a static dry nitrogen pressure (200 psig) while the other catalysts were<br>
treated. Wet hydrogen (1-psia) was processed over the oil pore-filled passivated<br>
catalyst for about 4 hours at 140°C before switching to dry hydrogen gas.<br>
Results<br>
[0031] Figure 3 and Table 4 indicate lower performance of the air<br>
 [0032] Figure 3 and Table 4, indicate lower performance of the air<br>
passivated catalysts when treated with wet nitrogen and hydrogen. It is clear that<br>
the catalyst activity is significantly lower to that of the catalyst dried and<br>
reduced with dry gases.<br>
[0033] The hydrogenation performance of the air-passivated catalyst<br>
subjected to wet hydrogen only was found to be marginally higher than that of<br>
the oxide catalyst of Example 4 treated with wet nitrogen and wet hydrogen.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0034] Figure 4 and Table 4, show that oil pore-filled passivated catalyst<br>
performance is similar to that of the oxide catalyst of Example 4 dried and<br>
reduced following the conventional pilot plant procedure, using dry gases. These<br>
results would indicate that no significant metal sintering occurred and that the<br>
active metal was fully accessible for the hydrogenation reaction.<br>
[0035] The small performance differences observed between the extrudates<br>
and the crush catalysts could be a result of a better packing when using crushed<br>
catalyst in the small diameter reactor or perhaps mass transfer restrictions.<br><br><br><br>
