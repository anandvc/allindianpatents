TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
FABRIC CARE COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br>
FABRIC CARE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to fabric care compositions, including detergent compositions and laundry rinse compositions.  The invention also relates, to methods of treating fabric using the compositions-'of the invention and to the use of anionic polymers in fabric care compositions.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
The laundry process generally has several benefits for fabric, the most common being to remove dirt and stains from the fabric during the wash cycle and to soften the fabric during the rinse cycle.  However, there are numerous disadvantages associated with repeated use of conventional laundry treatment compositions and/or the actual laundry process; one of. these being a fairly harsh treatment of fabric in the laundry process.<br>
Fabrics can be damaged in several ways as a result of repeated laundering and/or wear.  Fabric pilling and less cf fabric surface appearance eg fuzzing, shrinkage (or expansion), loss cf colour from the fabric or running of colour on the fabric (usually termed dye transfer) are some of the common problems  associated  with repeated  laundering. These problems may occur merely from repeated hand washing as well as the more vigorous machine washing process. Furthermore, problems relating to damage of fabric over time through normal use, such as loss of shape and increased<br><br><br>
likelihood of wrinkling are also significant, especially with articles of clothing.<br>
Laundry detergent compositions containing polyamide-polyamine fabric treatment agents are described in WO 98/2 9530.  The compositions are claimed to impart improved overall appearance to fabrics laundered using the detergent compositions, in terms of surface appearance properties such as pill/fuzz reduction and antifading.  Laundry compositions containing polyamide-pciyamine treatment agents of similar types are taught' in V10  97/42287.<br>
An industrial process for treating fibres is disclosed in US 3949014.  This document describes the use of a polyamine-epichlorohydrin resin in a binder, together with an amphoteric high molecular weight compound having at least 2 cationic groups and at least 2 anionic groups per molecule. US 3949014 mentions the treatment of fabrics with the binder but it is clear that the treatment is intended to be carried out industrially as part of a fabric;- treatment process rather than as part of a domestic laundering process and. this conclusion is supported by the fact that the fabric treated with the binder required curing at a relatively high temperature.  Industrial curing of fabrics treated with this type of polymer is normally carried cut at about 150=C.<br>
Methods for treating wool with compositions containing an amino functional polymer and a silicone polymer so as to impart shrink resistance are known.  However,, as described in ZP-A-0315477, wool requires a pretreatment before such compositions can be used.  Furthermore, EP-A-0372732<br><br>
explains that the chemistry of wool is quite different from that of cellulosic fibres such as cotton and the requirements for shrink resistance treatments for cotton are generally very different from those for wool.<br>
US 4371517 discloses a composition for treating fibrous materials which contain cationic and anionic polymers.  In a non-domestic treatment, the compositions increased the rigidity of cotton fabric.<br>
Detergent compositions which prevent dye transfer are   taught in EP-.-.-CQ53232.  The compositions contain nonionic or zwittericnic surfactants in combination with water-soluble, amino and/or amide group-containing polymers.<br>
WO 9S/17764 discloses the use of polyamidoamines, in washing and cleaning compositions, as soil release agents.<br>
Co-emulsifiers, for use in fabric softener and other compositions, which cont-ai-n cationi.c. quaternary amine polymers, are taught in DD 221922..<br>
G3 20C5322 discloses a method of treating textiles which involves treating the materials with a water-soluble polymeric material and an exhaustion agent. The polymers disclosed include the anionic polycarbamcyi-suphonates. The exhaustion agents are inorganic salts.<br>
US 41213G2 discloses a textile treatment composition which comprise water-soluble anionic polymers (poiycarbamoylsuphonates) and at least 20% of a water-<br><br>
insoluble organic polymer. Optional ingredients which may be present include cationic derivatives of polyamides (such as epichlorohydrin derivatives) or  cationic surfactants.<br>
G3 1329247 discloses a process for rendering keratinous or other protein material resistant to shrinkage. The process comprises a treatment with a resin followed treatment with a  soil release agent. The resin can be a cationic derivatives  of polyamide (such as an epichlorohydrin derivative).<br>
G3. 203 993 8 discloses a textile treatment composition which includes both anionic and cationic polymers.<br>
WO 98/29530 discloses the use of amine-amide epichlorohydrin resins to impart benefits regarding overall appearance, pill-fuzz reduction and antifading in the domestic laundry.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
According' to the present invention&gt; there- is.-provided- a-fabric care composition adapted for use in a domestic laundering process and comprising:<br>
a)	at least one reactive cationic polymer, which is an<br>
amine or amide epichlorhydrin resin,<br>
b)	at least one reactive anionic polymer of net negative<br>
charge, and,<br>
c)	at least one textile compatible carrier,<br>
said reaccive polymers each being capable of self cross-linking and/or cross linking co cellulose, wherein the cationic polymer and the anionic polymer are present in amounts such that the overall charge provided by the<br><br><br>
polymers is positive, and wherein the composition comprises less than 10% of water-insoluble organic polymers.<br>
It is believed that the use of an anionic polymer improves the dye transfer properties of a fabric care composition which comprises a cationic polymer.<br><br>
It is also believed that use of an anionic polymer improves the stain release properties of a fabric care composition which comprises a cationic polymer.<br>
Also provided by the present invention is a method of creating fabric comprising applying to the fabric a fabric care composition according to the invention as part of a laundering process.<br>
Detailed Descriction of the Invention<br>
n	MI<br>
Preferabiv, the reactive cationic polymer is an amine- or mide-epichlorohydrin resin or derivative thereof. Preferably these cationic polymers have a weight average {mean molecular weight of from 300 to 1,000,000 Dalton.<br>
The preferred epichiorohydrin resins of the invention are sometimes referred to below as amine-epichlorohydrin resins and polyamine-epichiorohydrin- v?AE7 resins- (-the two terms-<br>
being used synonymously) although these terms' encompass both<br>
i	.      ■ • ■•<br>
the amir.e and amide resins of the invention and their<br>
derivatives.  The resins may also have a mixture of amine<br>
and amide groups.<br>
The amine- or amide-epichiorchydrin resins may have one or mere functional groups capable of forming azetidinium groups and/or one or more azetidinium functional groups.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the resins may have one or more functional groups that contain epoxide groups or 'derivatives thereof eg Kymene™ 4 50 (ex Hercules).<br>
Suitable poiyamine-epichlorohydrin (?AE) resins include those described in "Wet Strength Resins and Their Application", pp 16-35, ed. LL Chan, Tappi Press, Atlanta, 1994.  Suitable resins can be identified by selecting those resins which impart increased wet strength to paper, after treatment, in a relatively simple test.<br>
Any amine- or amide-epichlorohydrin resin having an epoxide functional group or derivative thereof is suitable for use according, .to the. invention...<br>
A particularly preferred class of amine- or amide-epichicrohydrin resins for use in the invention are secondary amine- or amide-based, azetidinium resins, for example those resins derived from a polyalkylene poiyaraine eg ciethyienetriamine (DETA), a polycarboxyiic acid eg acipic acid or other dicarbcxylic acids, and epichlorohydrin.  Other polyamines or polyamides car. also be advantageously used in the preparation of suitable PAE resins<br><br>
Another preferred class of amine-epichlorohydrin resins for use in the invention are those having an epoxide functional group or derivative thereof eg a chlorohydrin group.<br>
The resin is preferably present in the product in a sufficient quantity to give an amount of 0.0005-5% by weight on the fabric based on the weight of fabric, (owf), more preferably 0.001-2% owf.  The amount of the resin in the  composition required to achieve the above %"by weight on  fabric will typically be in the range 0.01% to 35% by<br>
weight, preferably 0.1% to 13.5% by weight.<br>
	:<br><br>
 The resin may be a PDAA-epichlorohydrin resin or a PMDAA-<br>
 epichiorohydrin resin.  PDAA is poly(dialiyiamine) and PMDAA<br><br>
is  poly(methyldiallyl (amine)}.<br><br><br>
The fabric care compositions of the invention also comprise at least one reactive anionic polymer.<br>
The reactive, anionic .polymer is present in the composition in an amount such that the overall' negative charge contributed by the anionic groups of the anionic polymer is  less than the positive charge provided by the cationic groups of the cationic polymer (such as the amine-epichiorohydrin resin) and any cationic groups in the anionic polymer.<br>
Suitable amounts of reactive anionic polymer in the composition are in the range of from 0.01% to 35% by weight, preferably 0.1% to 13.5% by weight.  If the overall charge provided by the anionic polymer and the cationic polymer, as<br><br>
described above, is not positive, it is believed that the cationic polymer tends not to impart the benefits to  -he fabric which are imparted to the fabric in the absence of the anionic polymer.<br>
The anionic polymer may be any polymeric compound having a single unit which repeats .in the compound, on average at least five times, a plurality of anionic groups and a molecular weight of at least 400 Dalton, . preferably at least  600 Dalton.  The anionic polymer has negatively charged<br>
groups which may be present in the repeating group and/or at  one or bozh  of the ends of the polymer chain and may be introduced during polymerisation or after the polymer has<br>
been formed.  The anionic polymer may contain cationic  groups as well as anionic groups but the net charge on the  polymer chain must be negative.  The anionic polymer can be  wholly or partly amphoteric, provided that it is capable of having a net negative charge in the presence of the cationic polymer.  It is preferred that the anionic polymer comprises anionic groups which are oxo-anions of sulphur, carbon or phosphorus, or derivatives thereof such as, for example  sulphonate (SO3") and carboxylate (CO:-) groups.<br>
Preferred anionic polymers are polyisocyanate derivatives, preferably the bisulphite addition products such as  polycarbarr.oyl suiphamates. Preferably, the anionic polymer is selected from carbamoyl suichonate terminated poly (ether) urethane resins, bur.te salt terminated polymers and mixtures thereof.  Suitable polymers include those having the formula (I):<br><br>
CH2-0 [CK2CH (CH3) -0] n-Y-S03"M+ I<br>
[CH-0 [CH2CH (CH3) -0] „-Y-S03-M+j m I<br>
CH2-0 [CH2CH (CH3) -0] „-Y-503"M+ (I)<br>
wherein:<br>
Y   is   a  divalent   radical   selected  from  -CH2-CH (OH)-CH2-S-  and<br>
-CO-NH-(CH2)p-NH-C0-;<br>
m is an integer from 0 to 4;<br><br>
n is an integer from 5 to 20;<br>
M is an alkali metal; and<br>
P is an integer irom 2 to 12.<br><br><br>
 Preferably, m is equal to 1.<br>
Conveniently, Y is -C0-NH- (CH2)p-MK-C0-<br>
and, preferably, p is from 4 to- 3, such-as' about 6-.<br><br>
!	■	' ■ ■'<br>
It is also preferred that n is 10 to 15, such as about 13,<br>
for example.<br>
M is advantageously sodium or potassium, more preferably sodium.<br>
Polymers in which Y is -CO-NH-(CH2) p-N'H-C0- are commercially available under the Trade Mark SYNTKAPPRE? BAP (Bayer).<br><br>
Polymers in which Y is -CHi-CH (OH) -CH2-S- are available under the Trade Mark NOPCOLAN SKR3 (Henkel).<br>
The compositions of the invention, when applied to a fabric, may be cured by a domestic curing step including ironing and/or domestic tumble drying, preferably tumble drying. Preferably, these curing steps are carried out at temperatures in the range of from 60 to 100°C, more preferably from 80 to 100°C.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be used before, during or after a conventional laundry process and are preferably packaged and labelled as such.  The laundry process includes large and small scale processes, and is preferably a domestic process.<br>
When the compositions of the invention are to be used before or after the laundry process, they may be in the form of a spray or foaming product.<br>
When the compositions of the invention-are to be used during the laundry process, they may be used at any convenient stage of the process,   such as,   for example, in a pre-wash composition, in the main wash detergent composition and/or a rinse composition.<br>
In the context., of ..the .present invention the term 'textile compatible carrier' means a component which can assist in the interaction of the cationic polymer with the fabric. The carrier can also provide benefits in addition to those provided by the cationic polymer e.g. softening, cleaning<br><br>
etc.  The nature of the carrier will deoend upon at what stage of the laundry process the composition of the invention is used.  The carrier may be water or a detergent-accive compound or a fabric softener or conditioning compound or other suitable detergent or fabric treatment agent.<br>
If the composition of the invention is to be used in a laundry process as part of a conventional fabric treatment product, such as a detergent composition, the textile-compatible carrier will typically be a detergent-active compound.  Whereas, if the fabric treatment product is a rinse conditioner, the textile-compatible carrier will be a fabric softening and/or conditioning compound.<br>
Detergent Active Compounds<br>
If the composition of the present invention is in the form of a detergent composition (such as a main wash composition.), the  textile-compatible, carrier., may. be- chosen, from.soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>

 Quaternary ammonium compounds having two long-chain aliphatic groups, for example distearyldimethyl ammor.ium chloride and di (hardened tallow alkyi) dimethyl ammonium<br>
 chloride, are widely used in commercially available rinse conditioner compositions.  Other examples cf these cationic compounds are to be found in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch. Any of the conventional types of such compounds may be used in the compositions of the present invention.<br><br>
The fabric softening compounds are preferably compounds that orovide excellent softening, and are characterised by a chain melting LP to La transition temperature greater than 25CC, preferably greater than 35°C, most preferably greater than 4 5°C.  This LP to La transition can be measured by DSC as defined in "Handbook of Lipid Bilayers", D Marsh, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 1990 (pages 137 and 337). Substantially water-insoluble fabric softening compounds are defined as fabric softening compounds having a solubility of less than 1 x 1C'J wt % in demineraiised water at 20°C. Preferably the fabric softening compounds have a solubility of less than 1 x 10 wt %, more preferably less than 1 x 10" to 1 x 10"6 wt %.<br>
Especially preferred are cationic fabric softening compounds that are water-insoluble quaternary ammonium materials having two C12-22 alkyl or alkenyl groups connected to the molecule via at least one ester link, preferably two ester links'.  An especially preferred'ester-linked quaternary ammonium material can be represented by the formula II:<br><br><br>

Preferred materials of this class such as 1,2-bis (hardened tallowoyloxy) -3-trimethylammonium propane chloride and their methods of preparation are, for example, described in US 4 137 180 (Lever Brothers Co).  Preferably these materials comprise small amounts of the corresponding monoeszer as described in US 4 137 180, for example, 1-hardened tallowoyloxy-2-hydroxy-3-trimethy1ammonium propane chloride.<br>
Other useful cationic softening agents are alkyl pyridinium salts and substituted imidazoline species. Also useful are primary, secondary and tertiary amines and the condensation products of fatty acids with aikylpoiyamines.<br>
The compositions may alternatively or additionally contain water-soluble cationic fabric softeners, as described in GB 2 039 556B (Unilever).<br>
The compositions may comprise a cationic fabric softening compound and an oil., f,or example, as disclosed,,-Ln. EP.-A-0329531.<br>
The compositions may alternatively or additionally contain nonionic fabric softening agents such as lanolin and derivatives thereof.<br>
Lecithins are also suitable softening compounds.<br>
Nor.ionic softeners include LP phase forming sugar esters (as described in M Hato et al Langmuir 12, 1659, 1966,  (1996)) and related materials such as glycerol monostearate<br><br>
or sorbitan esters.  Often these materials are used in conjunction with cationic materials to assist deposition (see, for example, GB 2 202 244 ).  Silicones are used in a similar way as a co-softener with a cationic softener in rinse treatments (see, for example, GB 1 549 180) .<br>
The compositions may also suitably contain a r.onionic stabilising agent.  Suitable nonionic stabilising agents are linear Cg to C21  alcohols alkoxylated with 10 to 20 moles of alkylene oxide, C10 to C20 alcohols, or mixtures thereof.  Advantageously the nonionic stabilising agent is a linear C8   to C22 alcohol alkoxylated with 10 to 20 moles of alkyiene oxide.  Preferably, the level of nonionic stabiliser is within the range from 0.1 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight, most preferably from 1 to 4% by weight.  The mole ratio of the quaternary ammonium compound and/or other cationic softening agent to the nonionic stabilising agent is suitably within the range from 40:1 to about 1:1, preferably within the range from 18:1 to about 3:1.-<br>
The composition can also contain fatty acids, for example C$ to C24 alkyl or alkenyl monocarboxylic acids or polymers thereof.  Preferably saturated fatty acids are used, in particular hardened tallow C16 to C18 fatty acids.  Preferably the fatty acid is non-saponified, more preferably the fatty acid is free, for example oleic acid, lauric acid or tallow fatty acid.  The level of fatty acid material is preferably more than 0.1% by weight, more preferably more than 0.2% by weight.  Concentrated compositions may comprise from 0.5 to<br><br>
20% by weight of fatty acid, more preferably 1% to 10% by weight.  The weight ratio of quaternary ammonium material or other cationic softening agent to fatty acid material is preferably from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
The fabric conditioning compositions may include silicones, such as predominantly linear polydialkylsiloxanes, eg polydimethylsiloxanes or aminosilicones containing amine-functionalised side chains; soil release polymers such as block copolymers of polyethylene oxide and terephthalate; amphoteric surfactants; smectite type inorganic clays; zwitterionic quaternary ammonium compounds; and nonionic surfactants.  Preferably, the silicone component is a dimethylpolysiloxane with aminoalkyl groups.<br>
Preferably the ratio of amine- or amide-epichlorohydrin resin to the silicone component is from 1:1 to 30:1.<br>

Further optional ingredients include non-aqueous solvents, perfume carriers, fiuorescers, colourants, hydrotropes, antifoaming agents, antiredeposition agents, enzymes, optical brightening agents, opacifiers, anti-shrinking agents, anti-wrinkle agents, anti-spotting agents, dye transfer inhibitors, germicides, fungicides, anti-oxidants, UV absorbers (sunscreens), heavy metal sequestrants,  chlorine scavengers, dye fixatives, anti-corrosion agents,<br>
 draoe imoarting agents, antistatic agents and ironing aids.<br><br>
 This list is not intended to be exhaustive.<br><br><br><br>
 Fabric Treatment Products<br>
r  The composition of the invention may be in the form of a<br>
.<br>
 licuid, solid (eg powder or tablet), a eel or paste, spray,  stick or a roam or mousse.  Examples mcluae a soaking  product, a rinse treatment (eg conditioner or finisher) or a mainwash product.  The composition may also be applied to a substrate (eg a flexible sheet) or used in a dispenser which can be used in. the wash cycle, rinse cycle or during the  dryer cycle..<br>
The fabric care compositions of the present invention have beer,  found to possess the advantages of compositions containing cationic amine-epichiorohydrin resins, such as improved surface colour definition of the fabric following multiple washings and/or improved dimensional stability of the fabric and/or  reduced fabric fibrillation.. Moreover, the compositions of the invention exhibit reduced dye transfer and/or improved stain release properties relative to those comoositions.<br><br>
The use of anionic polymers to improve the dye transfer properties of a fabric care composition and/or to improve the stain release properties of a fabric care composition is applicable to compositions containing amine-epichiorohydrin resins and/or other cationic polymers.  Fabrics treated with the compositions of the invention can also exhibit beneficial properties due to the anionic polymer itself, such as antistatic properties, for example.<br>
The fabrics which may be treated in the present invention mav be in the form of garments and preferably comprise cellulcsic fibres, preferably from 1% to 100% celluiosic fibres (more preferably 5% to 100% celluiosic fibres, most preferably 40% to 100% such as 75% to 100%).  When the fabric contains less than 100% celluiosic fibres, the balance comprises other fibres or blends of fibres suitable for use in garments such as polyester or polyamide, for example.  Preferably, the cellulcsic fibres are of cotton or regenerated cellulose such as  viscose.<br>
The invention will now be described by, way of example only and with reference to the. following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 TO 2<br>
Fabric Preparation<br>
All samples were prepared by repeating the following method<br><br>
730g of fabric (3 "pieces undyed woven cotton sheeting, 1 piece of printed fabric for fabric care evaluation) was washed at 40 SC on a cotton wash cycle with 35g of Persil Original Non-3iological (trade mark) detergent. Samples were treated by rinse applying the required amount of product in the rinse cycle.<br>
The products applied were:<br>
Dontroi - 0.1% Apomul SAK™ (polyamine-epichlcrohydrin resin, 25 about 13% aqueous solution, Brookstone Chemicals) Example 1 - 0.1% Apomul SAK™ + 0.1% Synthappret 3A?™ Example 2 - 0.1% Apomul SAK™ + 0.15% Synthappret 3AP™<br>
Synthappret BAP™ is a polycarbamoyl sulphonate (a bisulphite adduct of a polyisocyanate) .<br>
After the five applications, samples of each treatment were evaluated for dye transfer and stain release.<br>
Dye transfer<br>
30 cm square samples of the control and the product treated according to the invention were washed at 40°C on a cotter: wash cycle in a Zar.ussi Jetsystem 1200 (trade mark) washing machine with 35g of Persil Original Non-Biological (trade mark) detergent together with Direct Red 3 0 standard cloths at a ratio of 6:1 treated : Direct Red SC followed by tumble drying in a Miele Novotronic T430 (trade mark) tumble dryer on wextra dry" setting.  The change in colour (AI) of the<br><br>
treated fabrics relative to untreated cloth subjected to the same dye transfer test was then measured using the Soectraflash (trade mark) spectrometer.<br>
Treatment	AE<br>
Control	3.12<br>
Example 1	4.92<br>
Example 2	4.4 9<br>
Stain Release<br>
Samples of the treated fabrics had 1 ml of red wine applied to the centre of the sample.  After the wine had soaked in, the sample was left under ambient conditions for five days. The stained area was then measured using the Soectraflash {trade mark) spectrometer.  The samples were then washed at 40CC with 35g of Persil 3iological Powder (trade mark), tumble dried and the stains measured again.<br>
Treatment   ' AE of stain   AE after .-washing   AAE<br>
Control       25.36	11.32	13.54<br>
Example 1     25.82	12.15	13.67<br>
Example 2      25.39	10.26	15.11<br>
In this  case  the larger AAE value, the more stair, has been, removed (ie the colour is paler).<br><br>
Garment Care Benefits<br>
The method used to determine the garment care benefit from the cationic polymers involved the determination of the effect of  washing  treatment on  the colour and  lightness  of  a printed fabric which is particularly susceptible to surface damage which appears as a change in the colour of the print.<br>
The load used for the experiment consisted of three pieces of woven cotton sheeting lm x i.52m weighing approximately 700 g in total, and a piece of the printed fabric measuring 0.5m x lm weighing approximately 30g, giving a total load weight of 730g.  This allows the fabric freedom to move within the machine resulting in more damage.<br>
The wash was carried out in a Zanussi Jetsystem 1200 (trade mark) washing machine at 40°C using 35g of Persil Original Non-Biological (trade mark) washing powder in the main wash. Treatments were applied in the rinse at a level to deliver 0.2% o.w.f. of active ingredient.<br>
After each cycle, the load was tumble 'dried in a Mieie Kovotronic T43C (trade mark) dryer using the extra-dry setting.<br>
After five wash/dry cycles, the appearance was compared to an untreated sample and colour measurements were taken as necessary -<br>
Where colour measurements were taken, the greater the change in colour (AE) or lightness (AL) indicates more severe<br><br>
damage which causes the colour to change more dramatically. The smaller the AE and AL values, the closer the fabric appearance is to the original, indicating a positive garmen: care benefit.<br>
Colour measurements were.carried out on areas of the printed fabric which had been dyed black and red.  The results are as follows:<br>
