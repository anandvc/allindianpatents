SPLIT-PRESSURE DUAL PUMP HYDRAULIC FLUID SUPPLY SYSTEM<br>
FOR A MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION AND METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to hydraulic fluid control systems, namely<br>
oil supply systems for multi-speed transmissions having dual pumps working in unison<br>
and controlled by a regulating valve.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Automotive and commercial vehicles include a powertrain that is<br>
comprised of an engine, a multi-speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The<br>
multi-speed power transmission requires a supply of pressurized fluid to properly<br>
operate. The pressurized fluid may be used for such functions as cooling, lubrication,<br>
and torque converter operation. It is well known that the lubricating and cooling<br>
capabilities of transmission oil systems greatly impact the reliability and durability of the<br>
transmission. Additionally, multi-speed power transmissions require the hydraulic<br>
system to provide controlled engagement and disengagement, on a desired schedule, of<br>
the various torque transmitting mechanisms that operate to establish the speed ratios<br>
within the internal gear arrangement.<br>
[0003]	Transmissions are traditionally supplied with hydraulic fluid by a wet<br>
sump (i.e., single-pump, internal reservoir), cascading oil system, which is separate from<br>
the engine oil system. The fluid is typically stored in a main reservoir or main sump<br>
volume where it is introduced to a pickup or inlet tube for communication to the single<br>
hydraulic pump. The pump operates to pressurize the fluid for subsequent<br>
communication to the transmission.<br>
[0004]	It is well known to utilize one or more fixed displacement (or "PF'1,<br>
according to industry custom) pumps in multi-speed transmissions. A PF pump can<br>
generate relatively instantaneous pressure and flow to a hydraulic circuit when the circuit<br>
is opened due to the positive displacement characteristic of PF type pumps.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005]	A high-pressure PF pump serves a number of important roles.  First,<br>
high oil pressure has traditionally been required to maintain torque converter charge<br>
pressure, which is the torque converter oil inlet pressure at the centerline of the<br>
transmission. It is necessary to maintain this pressure to avoid cavitation, which is not<br>
only inefficient, but can be damaging to the internal componentry of the torque<br>
converter. More notably, the high-pressure pump supplies the fluid pressure necessary<br>
to selectively apply the transmissions torque transmitting mechanisms.  The single PF<br>
pump is required to satisfy both the high-pressure/low-flow requirements while<br>
simultaneously satisfying the low-pressure/high-flow requirements. The single PF<br>
system is inefficient in applications requiring high-pressure fluid because the PF pump<br>
continues to deliver high flow, high pressure fluid even when only low pressure and/or<br>
low flow is needed. Hence, the single PF pump is expending power equal to its total<br>
output flow and pressure (i.e., high-pressure and high-flow), even though the<br>
transmission is using only a portion of that flow. This parasitic loss results in<br>
unnecessary consumption of power from the motor vehicle engine or battery and may<br>
tend to reduce the overall life of the pump.<br>
[0006]	In systems where the hydraulic circuit has a relief valve, the valve will<br>
"dump" excess fluid flow as it is being pumped by the PF pump, thereby generating<br>
undesirable heat in the hydraulic fluid. Multiple PF pump systems are designed to<br>
minimize this undesirable behavior by having a different PF pump that can be called<br>
upon to deliver a required fluid flow or pressure depending upon the operating<br>
conditions. However, PF systems with multiple pumps still have the high pressure<br>
deficiencies mentioned above.<br>
[0007]	A common type of PF pump used in multi-speed transmissions is a gerotor<br>
pump ("GP"). The GP includes a ring gear supported by a pump housing. In addition, a<br>
pinion gear is rotatably mounted inside the ring gear for rotation about parallel, laterally<br>
separated centerlines. The teeth on the respective gears cooperate to define a plurality of<br>
variable volume pumping chambers. During rotation of the gear members, each pumping<br>
chamber expands in an inlet half, and collapses in a discharge half. Fluid from the GP's<br>
low-pressure, inlet port is drawn into pumping chambers that are increasing in volume.<br><br>
3<br>
Upon further rotation, when the pumping chambers are decreasing in volume, the fluid is<br>
pushed out through the pump's outlet or discharge port at a higher pressure. The inlet and<br>
the discharge ports are separated angularly or "timed" to prevent the pump chambers<br>
from simultaneously overlapping both the inlet port and the discharge port.<br>
[0008]	It is also known to use a single variable displacement (or "PV", according<br>
to industry custom) pump to satisfy the hydraulic fluid needs of a multi-speed<br>
transmission. The PV pump produces a variable flow on demand. Thus, in standby<br>
conditions, PV pump systems do not circulate as much hydraulic fluid.<br>
[0009]	A single PV pump traditionally employs a rotor having multiple slots<br>
circumferentially disposed about the rotor, wherein a plurality of vanes are slidably<br>
disposed, and a slide member to vary the volume of fluid delivered to a hydraulic work<br>
circuit. The slide member is eccentrically offset from the rotor to create fluid chambers<br>
defined by the vanes, rotor, and inner surface of the slide. A compression spring,<br>
connected to a regulator arm on the periphery of the slide, positions the slide to create<br>
large fluid chambers as the default. When the transmission requires less fluid, a pressure<br>
regulator directs fluid from the pump output line to a regulating chamber in the PV pump.<br>
Pressure in the regulating chamber pivots the slide against the force of the spring to more<br>
closely align the centers of the rotor and slide, reducing the eccentricity offset, thereby<br>
reducing the size of the fluid chambers. This reduces the amount of fluid drawn into the<br>
pump from the fluid reservoir and likewise, the amount of fluid output by the pump.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	A hydraulic fluid supply system is provided that utilizes a split-pressure<br>
work circuit configuration in cooperation with first and second pumps to continuously<br>
deliver variable flow, high-pressure fluid and fixed flow, low-pressure fluid, depending<br>
on the individual needs of two independent work circuits.<br>
[0011]	In one embodiment of the present invention, a split-pressure hydraulic<br>
fluid supply circuit for supplying pressurized fluid to a multi-speed transmission is<br>
provided. The transmission has a power source for driving the hydraulic system, and one<br>
or more reservoirs for storing and supplying the system with hydraulic fluid. The split-<br><br>
4<br>
pressure hydraulic fluid supply circuit includes a first pump, a second pump, a low-<br>
pressure circuit portion, and a high-pressure circuit portion. The first pump has both<br>
inlet and outlet ports, and is driven by the power source to provide a continuous flow of<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid at a fixed rate. The second pump has an inlet port, an outlet<br>
port, and a regulator port, and is driven by the power source to provide a continuous flow<br>
of pressurized hydraulic fluid at variable rates. The low-pressure circuit portion includes<br>
a low-pressure work circuit fluidly coupled to the first pump. The low-pressure circuit<br>
portion is preferably adapted to supply all of the low-pressure hydraulic fluid necessitated<br>
by the multi-speed transmission. The high-pressure circuit portion includes a high-<br>
pressure work circuit fluidly coupled to the second pump. The high-pressure circuit<br>
portion is preferably adapted to supply all of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid<br>
necessitated by the multi-speed transmission.   It is further preferred that there be no fluid<br>
coupling between the high-pressure work circuit and the low-pressure work circuit.<br>
[0012]	In a preferred embodiment, the first pump is a fixed displacement ("PF")<br>
pump and the second pump is a variable displacement ("PV") pump. However, it is also<br>
considered to be within the scope of the present invention that both pumps be PV pumps.<br>
It is preferred that the high-pressure work circuit is not fluidly coupled to the first pump,<br>
and the low-pressure work circuit is not fluidly coupled to the second pump. In this<br>
preferred embodiment, the invention separates the low-flow, high-pressure needs of the<br>
transmission into a separate work circuit from the high-flow, low-pressure needs, and<br>
optimizes pump design separately for each circuit portion to maximize transmission<br>
efficiency. The combination of a PF pump and PV pump in a regulated system has the<br>
advantage of the instant acting fluid delivery inherent in a fixed displacement pump, and<br>
the high pressure, low horsepower consuming characteristics available with a variable<br>
displacement pump. A combination pump system therefore maximizes performance,<br>
efficiency, and dependability while minimizing costs.<br>
[0013]	In a second embodiment, an oil pump assembly is provided. The oil pump<br>
assembly includes a fixed displacement PF pump, a variable displacement PV pump, a<br>
regulator, and one or more power sources connected to the oil pump assembly. One or<br>
more reservoirs are fluidly coupled to the oil pump assembly in order to store and supply<br><br>
5<br>
hydraulic fluid to both the PF and the PV. The power source(s) drive the fixed<br>
displacement pump and the variable displacement pump in order to supply hydraulic<br>
pressure.<br>
[0014]	The oil pump assembly includes a plurality of hydraulic conduits for<br>
transferring oil to and from the PF and PV pumps.   A first conduit defines a low-pressure<br>
work circuit for supplying a continuous flow of oil at low pressure and a fixed rate. The<br>
low-pressure work circuit is fluidly coupled to the PF pump, but is not fluidly coupled to<br>
the PV pump. A second conduit defines a high-pressure work circuit for supplying a<br>
continuous flow of oil at high-pressure and variable rates. The high-pressure work circuit<br>
is fluidly coupled to the PV pump, but is not fluidly coupled to the PF pump. It is<br>
preferred, but not required, that the low-pressure work circuit supply only low-pressure<br>
hydraulic fluid at a high flow, and the high-pressure work circuit supply only high-<br>
pressure hydraulic fluid at either a high flow or a low flow.<br>
[0015]	The oil pump assembly also includes a third conduit which defines a<br>
decrease circuit that is fluidly coupled to the regulator and the PV pump for reducing the<br>
flow of fluid to the high-pressure work circuit. It is preferred that there is no fluid<br>
coupling between the decrease circuit and either the PF pump or the reservoir.  The oil<br>
pump assembly preferably also includes a fourth conduit that defines an overage circuit.<br>
The overage circuit is fluidly coupled to the regulator and the PV pump, but is not fluidly<br>
coupled to the PF pump. The overage circuit is a "backup' feature for further reducing<br>
the flow of fluid to the high-pressure work circuit when the decrease circuit is at full<br>
capacity and the PV pump is still pumping more fluid then demanded by the high-<br>
pressure work circuit.<br>
[0016]	An additional aspect of the present invention is to provide a novel<br>
method of supplying a variable flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid to a multi-speed<br>
transmission. The method includes the steps of: pumping a fixed flow of low-pressure<br>
fluid to a low-pressure work circuit using a fixed displacement pump; pumping a variable<br>
flow of high-pressure fluid to a high-pressure work circuit using a variable displacement<br>
pump; and, operating the fixed displacement pump to supply fluid to the low-pressure<br>
work circuit at substantially the same time as the variable displacement pump supplies<br><br>
6<br>
fluid to the high-pressure work circuit. It is preferred that the high pressure work circuit<br>
is not fluidly coupled to the low pressure work circuit or the PF pump. The method may<br>
also include, as an additional step, regulating the flow of high-pressure fluid into the<br>
high-pressure work circuit with a decrease circuit that is fluidly coupled to the PV pump<br>
and not fluidly coupled to the low-pressure work circuit or the reservoir.<br>
[0017]	The above features and advantages, and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention, will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of<br>
the preferred embodiments and best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in<br>
connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0022]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components throughout the several views, Fig. 1 illustrates an oil pump assembly or oil<br>
pump system, shown generally as 10, in accordance with the present invention. The oil<br>
pump assembly 10, described herein for supplying hydraulic fluid to a multi-speed<br>
power transmission (not shown) of an automobile (not shown), may also be applied in<br>
other various applications, such as, by way of example, aeronautical vehicles (e.g.,<br><br>
7<br>
airplanes, helicopters, etc.), agricultural vehicles (e.g., combine, tractor, etc.),<br>
construction vehicles (e.g., forklift, backhoe, excavator, etc.), and stationary machines<br>
(e.g., hydraulic press, hydraulic drill, etc.).<br>
[0023]	The oil pump assembly 10 includes an assembly housing 12 having<br>
opposing front and rear faces 14, 16 (Fig. 1), respectively, and a first pump 18 in face-to-<br>
face relation with a second pump 20. The first pump 18 (illustrated in an exemplary<br>
embodiment in Fig. 4) is preferably a fixed displacement pump of the positive<br>
displacement type (also referred to herein as "PF"), and the second pump 20 (illustrated in<br>
an exemplary embodiment in Fig. 3) is a variable displacement pump (also referred to<br>
herein as "PV"), as is understood by those skilled in the art. It is also considered to be<br>
within the scope of the present invention that both pumps 18, 20 be PV pumps. The first<br>
pump 18 includes a pump body 22 having opposing front and rear faces 24, 26,<br>
respectively (illustrated in Fig. 4). The second pump 20 includes a pump body 28 having<br>
opposing front and rear faces 30, 32, respectively (illustrated in Fig. 3). As seen in Fig. 1,<br>
the front face 30 of the second pump 20 is secured in a face-to-face relation to the rear face<br>
16 of the assembly housing 12 by, e.g., bolts 34. As seen in Fig. 3, the front face 24 of the<br>
first pump 18 is secured to the rear face 32 of the second pump 20 by, for example, bolts<br>
36. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the housing assembly 12<br>
depicted in Fig. 1 may include any convenient structural member commonly associated<br>
with the transmission or surrounding vehicle structure (not shown).<br>
[0024]	The oil pump assembly 10 also includes a power source 38, depicted<br>
schematically in Fig. 2, to communicate a driving force to both the first and second<br>
pumps 18, 20. It should be recognized that Fig. 2 is only a schematic representation and<br>
alternate methods of pump driving are available, including, e.g., the vehicle's engine, an<br>
electric motor, and the like. Furthermore, the oil pump assembly 10 may include multiple<br>
power sources for driving each of the first and second pumps 18, 20.<br>
[0025]	The oil pump assembly 10 preferably includes or is in fluid<br>
communication with a single internal reservoir, depicted generally as 40 in Fig. 2,<br>
commonly referred to as a sump volume, in fluid communication with an inlet port 42 of<br>
the first pump 18 and an inlet port 44 of the second pump 20 via a pickup or reservoir<br><br>
8<br>
circuit 46. However, the oil pump assembly 10 may include multiple reservoirs, and the<br>
reservoir(s) 40 may be packaged at locations outside of the pump assembly 10. The<br>
reservoir 40 stores and supplies the hydraulic fluid 41 (i.e., oil) pressurized and fed to the<br>
transmission by the oil pump assembly 10, as understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0026]	Turning to Fig. 2 of the drawings, a partial schematic view of a dual-<br>
pump, split-pressure hydraulic fluid supply circuit, shown generally as 11, is illustrated<br>
in accordance with the oil pump assembly 10 of Fig. 1.  The dual-pump, split-pressure<br>
hydraulic fluid supply circuit, referred to hereinafter as DPSP 11, includes a low-pressure<br>
side or circuit portion, identified generally by the dashed box 48, and a high-pressure<br>
side or circuit portion, identified generally by the dashed box 50.<br>
[0027]	The low-pressure circuit portion 48 includes a low-pressure work circuit<br>
52 fluidly coupled to the first pump 18 via outlet port 56. The first pump 18 is driven by<br>
the power source 38 to provide a continuous or uninterrupted flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid 41 at a fixed rate, depending upon the needs of the low-pressure work<br>
circuit 52. The low-pressure circuit portion 48 is preferably adapted to supply all of the<br>
low-pressure hydraulic fluid necessitated by the multi-speed transmission.<br>
[0028]	The high-pressure circuit portion 50 includes a high-pressure work circuit<br>
54 fluidly coupled to the second pump 20 via outlet port 58. The second pump 20 also<br>
includes a regulator port 60 having an orifice 62, and is driven by the power source 38 to<br>
provide a continuous or uninterrupted flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid 41 at variable<br>
rates, depending upon the needs of the high-pressure work circuit 54. The orifice 62 is<br>
located between the regulator port 60 of the second pump 20 and a regulator valve 94.<br>
The orifice 62 functions acts as a hydraulic damper and exhaust. The high-pressure<br>
circuit portion 50 is preferably adapted to supply all of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid<br>
necessitated by the multi-speed transmission.   In other words, the DPSP 11 separates the<br>
high-pressure needs of the transmission into a separate work circuit from the low-<br>
pressure needs, and optimizes pump design separately for each side or circuit portion 48,<br>
50 to maximize transmission efficiency and reduce parasitic losses.<br>
[0029]	By splitting the high- and low-pressure work circuits 52, 54, respectively,<br>
along with the use of the second pump 20 for supplying the high-pressure work circuit<br><br>
9<br>
54, the oil pump system 10 is more efficient because the second pump 20 can be<br>
selectively regulated to supply a low rate of flow, while the first pump 18 is putting out a<br>
high rate of flow. High-flow/high-pressure hydraulic fluid is only needed intermittently<br>
when a torque transmitting mechanism (i.e., a clutch, not shown) is being filled, whereas<br>
high-flow/low-pressure fluid is needed continuously for lubrication and cooling purposes.<br>
Less power is consumed by the oil pump assembly 10 because the low-pressure circuit<br>
portion 48 is separated from the high-pressure circuit portion 50; thus, the low-pressure<br>
work circuit 48 does not require an initial supply of hydraulic fluid 41 at high-pressure,<br>
and thereafter be cascaded down to a lower pressure, as in traditional wet sump,<br>
cascading oil systems, which unnecessarily consumes power and produces heat, as<br>
explained above. It should be noted that the high pressure work circuit 54 is not<br>
restricted to filling the aforementioned torque transmitting mechanisms. In the same<br>
regards, the low pressure work circuit 52 is not restricted to cooling and lubrication<br>
purposes. A work circuit, as understood by those skilled in the art, may include one or<br>
more of a hydrostatic or hydraulic transmission means (not shown), direction control<br>
means (not shown), and any other unspecified fluid operated apparatus as can be<br>
imagined. By way of example, the low-pressure work circuit 52 may be employed to<br>
supply the torque converter (not shown) with hydraulic fluid 41, and the high-pressure<br>
work circuit 54 may have additional internal actuators (not shown) that require hydraulic<br>
fluid 41 at high-pressure.<br>
[0030]	As depicted in Fig. 2, there is no fluid coupling between the high-pressure<br>
work circuit 54 and the low-pressure work circuit 52. It is also preferred that the high-<br>
pressure work circuit 54 is not fluidly coupled to the first pump 18, and the low-pressure<br>
work circuit 52 is not fluidly coupled to the second pump 20.<br>
[0031]	Now referring to Figure 3 of the drawings, the second (PV) pump 20, in<br>
accordance with the embodiments of Figs. 1-2, is depicted in an exemplary embodiment<br>
as a vane-type PV pump. The second (PV) pump 20 includes a pivot pin 70 mounted to<br>
the pump body 28. A ring member, also referred to as a slide 72, is pivotally mounted on<br>
the pivot pin 70. The slide 72 is urged to the position shown in Fig. 3 by a compression<br><br>
10<br>
spring 74, which is disposed in a cylindrical opening 76 formed in the pump body 28, and<br>
abuts a regulator arm 78 formed on the slide 72.<br>
[0032]	A pump drive shaft, depicted schematically in Fig. 2 as 80, is rotatably<br>
mounted to the assembly housing 12 through a needle bearing (not shown) or the like.<br>
The drive shaft 80 is drivingly connected to a coupling feature, such as spline 81 formed<br>
in a pump rotor 82, which is slidably disposed on an inner peripheral side of the slide 72.<br>
The pump rotor 82 has a plurality of circumferentially disposed radial slots 84 formed<br>
therein. Within each slot 84 is slidably disposed a vane member 68. The vanes 68 are<br>
urged radially outward by vane positioning rings (not shown) and centrifugal force<br>
towards an inner cylindrical surface 86 of the slide 72<br>
[0033]	The pump body 28 has formed therein a pair of kidney shaped ports,<br>
acting as an inlet port 88 and an outlet port 90. A plurality of fluid chambers 92 are<br>
formed by the rotor 82, vanes 68, and an inner cylindrical surface 86 of the slide 72, and<br>
are successively connected to the inlet and outlet ports 88, 90. The chambers 92 rotate<br>
with the rotor 82 (indicated by the directional arrows in Fig. 2) and expand and contract<br>
during rotation due to an eccentric offset between the slide 72 and rotor 82. The<br>
chambers 92 expand in the area of the inlet port 88, which accepts hydraulic fluid 41<br>
from the reservoir 40, and passes it to the chambers 92. Thereafter, the chambers 92<br>
contract in the area of the outlet port 90 to discharge the hydraulic fluid 41 through the<br>
outlet port 90 to the high pressure work circuit 54.<br>
[0034]	Referring again to Fig. 2, the high pressure circuit portion 50 further<br>
includes a decrease circuit 64 fluidly connected to the regulator valve 94 and the second<br>
(PV) pump 20 via the regulator port 60. The decrease circuit 64 acts as a "'feedback<br>
circuit" for the second (PV) pump 20, essentially redirecting hydraulic fluid 41 from the<br>
regulator valve 94 back to the slide 72 via the regulator port 60. When there is little<br>
demand from the high pressure work circuit 54, pressure in the high pressure work circuit<br>
54 will begin to rise as the hydraulic fluid 41 begins to backup. Once the backup<br>
pressure reaches a certain first threshold, the regulator valve 94 is actuated (or "stroked")<br>
to a first position 96 thereby redirecting some of the flow of hydraulic fluid 41 back to<br>
the second (PV) pump 20 via the decrease circuit 64. As the pressure in the decrease<br><br>
11<br>
circuit 64 increases, the eccentricity between the slide 72 and the rotor 82 of the second<br>
(PV) pump 20 decreases; as the eccentricity decreases, the chambers 92 also decrease in<br>
size, thereby reducing the volume of fluid 41 transferred to the outlet port 90.<br>
Consequently, the volume of hydraulic fluid 41 delivered from the second (PV) pump 20<br>
to the high-pressure work circuit 54 decreases (i.e., less flow, same high pressure.)<br>
[0035]	Still referring to Fig. 2, the high pressure circuit portion 50 preferably also<br>
includes a main overage circuit 66 fluidly connected to the regulator valve 94 and the<br>
inlet port 44. In an instance where the second (PV) pump 20 is fully "de-stroked" (i.e.,<br>
the eccentricity between the slide 72 and rotor 82 is at its physical minimum), and<br>
continues to output more hydraulic fluid 41 than is demanded by the high-pressure work<br>
circuit 54, the pressure in the high-pressure work circuit 54 will again start to increase.<br>
Once the backup pressure reaches a second threshold, the regulator valve 94 will stroke<br>
to a second position 98 and thereby divert surplus hydraulic fluid 41 from the high-<br>
pressure circuit 54 to the main overage circuit 66. It is preferred that the main overage<br>
circuit 66, in turn, re-direct the hydraulic fluid 41 to the inlet port 44, and not the<br>
reservoir 40, in order to avoid "turnover" of the hydraulic fluid 41. Conversely, it is<br>
contemplated that the main overage circuit 66 redirect the hydraulic fluid 41 to the<br>
reservoir 40 without compromising the scope and intent of the present invention. In this<br>
regard, it should be noted that the main overage circuit 66 is more of a backup feature in<br>
the regulator valve 94, and is not a critical feature to the functionality of the present<br>
invention. In addition, the regulator valve 94 is depicted in Fig. 4 as a single mechanical<br>
valve. However, it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize alternative<br>
means for regulating the flow of hydraulic fluid 41 to the high-pressure work circuit 54,<br>
such as, by way of example, one or more electro-mechanical valves (i.e., a solenoid, not<br>
shown), electro-hydraulic valves (not shown), and the like.<br>
[0036]	In an exemplary embodiment, the first (PF) pump 18 is depicted in Fig. 4<br>
as a gerotor-type lube pump. The gerotor pump 18 includes a ring gear 120 having a<br>
cylindrical outside surface 124 cooperating with a cylindrical inside surface 126 of a<br>
pump body 22, which supports the ring gear 120 for rotation about a first axis A. A<br>
pinion gear 128 of the gerotor pump 18 is disposed inside of the ring gear 120 and<br><br>
12<br>
coupled to the drive shaft 80 (depicted schematically in Fig. 2) through connection points<br>
(not shown) for rotation as a unit with the drive shaft 80 about a second axis B. The first<br>
axis A is radially offset at a fixed eccentricity from the second axis B, which creates the<br>
eccentric rotational meshing of the two gears 120, 128 commonplace with gerotor type<br>
pumps.<br>
[0037]	The lateral separation between the two axis's A, B defines a crescent<br>
shaped cavity 132 between the ring gear 120 and the pinion gear 128, fluidly sealed on<br>
opposite sides by both the rear face 16 of the assembly housing 12 and an outboard cap<br>
37 (Fig. 1.) The two ends of the cavity 132 are separated from each other by a pinion<br>
gear tooth 134 in full mesh with ring gear teeth 136. The pinion gear 128 has one less<br>
tooth than the ring gear 120. With rotation of the ring gear 120 and the pinion gear 128<br>
(indicated by the directional arrows in Fig. 2) a pinion gear tooth 134 cooperates with a<br>
ring gear tooth 136 in dividing the cavity 132 into an inlet half 138 and a discharge half<br>
140. The gear teeth 134, 136 on the pinion gear 128 and the ring gear 120 cooperate in<br>
defining a plurality of pump chambers 142 of the gerotor pump 18 which expand in the<br>
inlet half 138 and collapse in the discharge half 140 of the crescent-shaped cavity 132.<br>
[0038]	The hydraulic fluid 41 is drawn in through a low-pressure, inlet port 144<br>
into a pumping chamber 142 (at the inlet half 138) that are increasing in volume. Upon<br>
further rotation, when the pumping chambers 142 are decreasing in volume, the hydraulic<br>
fluid 41 is pushed out through the pump's outlet or discharge port 146 at a higher<br>
pressure. The inlet and discharge ports 144, 146, respectively, are separated angularly or<br>
"timed" to prevent the pump chambers 142 from simultaneously overlapping both the<br>
inlet port 144 and the discharge port 146, as is understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0039]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize<br>
various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the<br>
scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
