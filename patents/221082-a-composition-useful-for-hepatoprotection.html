Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition useful for hepatoprotection, said composition comprising polar extract of plant Cryptolepis Buchanani and/or fractions of the said extract, and optionally pharmaceutically acceptable additives and a method of producing said composition and also a method of treating a subject using said composition.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Cryptolepis  buchanani  Roem.   &amp;   Schult.   (Family  Asclepiadaceae)  is  distributed<br>
throughout hot deciduous forests of India and holds a very prestigious position in<br>
Ayurveda.<br>
It is a very useful plant because of its multiple uses as a traditional medicine, such as<br>
anti-diarrheal, anti- bacterial, anti-ulcerative, anti-inflammatory, blood purifier and for<br>
lactation in women [Bhakuni, D.S., Dhar, M.L.,Dhar, M.M., Dhawan, B. N., and<br>
Mehrotra, B. N.,. Ind. J. Expt. Biol., 7: 250 - 262 (1969), Bhav Prakash, Commentary<br>
on Bhav Prakash Nighantu edited by C.K. Chunekar, Chowkhamba Vidya Bhavan,<br>
Varanasi 4th edition: 427 (1969)].<br>
Ethanolic  extract  of roots  and  stem  show hypotensive,  central  nervous  system<br>
depressant and antiamphetaminic activity [Joshi, M.C., Patel, M.B. and Mehta, P. J.<br>
Bull. Med. Ethno. Bot. Res., 1: 8-24 (1980)].<br>
Ethanolic extract of aerial parts of plant shows diuretic activity [Dhawan, B.N., Patnaik,<br>
O.K., Rastogi, R.P., Singh, K.K. and Tandon, J.S.,   Ind. J. Expt. Biol.,15: 208-219<br>
(1977)].<br>
Root bark is used in rheumatic pains [Mudgal, V. and Pal, D.C., Bull. Bot. Surv. Ind.,<br>
22:59-62(1980)].<br><br>
Stem constituents are alkaloids and triterpenes, leaves constituents are a and P amyrin ( Asolkar, L.V., Kakkar, K.K. and Chakre, O.J., Glossary of Indian Medicinal Plants with active principles, part -1, A-K., 1965-1981(1992)] and cryptolepine - the methyl-quinolanol alkaloid of cryptolepis sanguinolenta. Pyridine alkaloid, buchanine [Dutta, Sunil K, Sharma, Batuk N, Sharma, Priya V. Phytochemistry 17, 2047(1978)] and a cardenolide cryptosin, 7,8-Epoxy- 3, ll,14-trihydroxy-12-0xocard 20 (22)-enolide [Venkateshwara R; Narendra N; Viswametra M.A; Vaidyanathan C.S.; Phytochemistry 28, 1203 (1989)] are the major chemical constituent of the plant. Apart from these chemical constituents cryptanoside -A to D and germenicol [Purshothman K.K; Saradha V; Connolly J.D; Rycroft D.S, Rev. Latinomer Quint., 19, 28 (1988)], 1, 3, 6-trinicotinoyl-p-D-glucopyranoside and 1, 3, 6-trinicotinoyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, n-trinicontanol, n-triactonoic acid, p-amyrin and p-sitosterol glucoside [Dutta S.K; Sharma B.N; Sharma P.V., Phytochemistry, 17, 2047 (1978), Dutta S.K; Sharma B.N, Sharma P.V; (1980) Phytochemistry, 19, 1278 (1980)].<br>
The alcoholic extract of the root shows the presence of sterols, reducing sugars and traces of glycosides and exhibited antiplatelet effects in vitro in humans, rabbits and rats. In rats, it exhibited ADP- aggregation in vitro with delayed onset and prolonged action. It exhibited an indirect fibrinolytic action in the rat possibly by causing the release of plasminogen activators from the vascular endothelium [Oyekan, A.O., Sotting, J.H. andNoamesi, B.K., General Pharmacol, 19: 223 -227 (1988)]. Liver has a pivotal role in regulation of physiological processes. Toxic chemicals and infections mainly cause liver diseases. Hepatocyte alterations of various origins result in acute and chronic dysfunctions, which may be lethal [Decker K. and Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol., 71, 79-106 (1974)].<br>
Liver disorders are still the major hazard both in urban and rural population. Despite scientific advances in our understanding in the management of liver disorders and the leads provided by traditional system of medicine, no specific treatment for liver ailments is available except a few herbal preparations, WHO, Regional Office Manila, 1993.; [Subeamoniam and Pushpangadan, Indian Journal of Pharmacology, 31,166-175 (1999)].<br><br>
It is emphasized that hepatotoxin that causes acute hepatitis should have close resemblance with the viral hepatitis, clinically, biochemically and histologically. In many instances drug induced hepatitis proves indistinguishable from viral hepatitis. Chemically induced hepatic injury for experimental studies should be severe enough to cause death or to modify hepatic function. The mechanism of acute hepatic injury depends upon the chemical compound and the species of animals used. Many chemicals produce parenchymal damage (cytotoxic injury), arrest bile flow and cause jaundice. The damage may be acquired or toxicological phenonmenon, therapeutic misadventure or induced experimentally. Drugs also cause chronic hepatic diseases such as hepatitis, fatty liver, cirrhosis, and several vascular lesions of the liver.<br>
It is the role of hepatoprotective agents to interfere with these pathological processes by blocking their evolution and helping recovery by preventing hepatocytes degeneration, necrosis, steatosis and inflammation, stimulate regeneration processes, and inhibit fibrosis which leads to cirrhosis and death [Doreswamy, R., Sharma, D., Indian Drugs, 32, 139-144 (1995)], Kumar et al, Cell injury and adaptation. In: "Basic Pathology", 5th. Edn. Prime Books (pvt.) Ltd., Banglore, India. 1992, pp. 3-24.<br>
Acute hepatitis closely resembling viral hepatitis clinically, biochemically and histologically, can be produced by chemicals and drugs in humans and experimental animals, [AL-Tuwaijiri A. et al Heptology, 51: 107-113 (1981); Decker K. and Keppler D. Rev Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol, 71, 79-106 (1974); Kumar et al, Cell injury and adaptation. In: "Basic Pathology", 5th. Edn. Prime Books (Pvt.) Ltd., Banglore, India. 1992, pp. 3-24].<br>

The first group served as normal control and received vehicles by gavage (normal saline and liquid paraffin) only.<br>
The second group served as CCU control and received by gavage vehicle (normal saline) and liquid paraffin (1:1).<br>
The remaining groups were respective drug and CCU by gavage.<br>
The percentage hepatoprotective activity (H) was calculated by the following equation:<br>
H= (1 -   TC-V ) xlOO VC-V<br>
The results are compared and calculated as:<br>
V = is the negative control group treated with vehicle as normal saline or liquid paraffin only.<br>
T C = is the Drug + CCU treated group. V C = is the Vehicle + CC14 treated group<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A composition useful for hepatoprotection, said composition<br>
comprising polar solvent extract from plant Cryptolepis buchanani<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable additives in a ratio ranges<br>
between 1 : 1 to 1 : 10.<br>
2.	A composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein said additives are<br>
selected from a group of nutrients comprising proteins,<br>
carbohydrates , sugar, talc, magnesium stearate, cellulose, calcium<br>
carbonate, starch-gelatin paste, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, excipient, diluent, or solvent.<br>
3.	A composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein polar solvents are<br>
selected from a group comprising alcohol, rectified spirit, aqueous<br>
rectified spirit, and water.<br>
4.	A composition as claimed in claim 1 - 3 wherein the method of<br>
preparing polar solvent extract A001 and its four fractions F001,<br>
F002, F003 and F004 as described in the figure 1 accompanying<br>
the specification from plant Cryptolepis buchanani having<br>
hepatoprotective activity , said method comprising:<br>
(i)       powdering said plant,<br>
(ii)       percolating said powder in cold with polar solvent, (iii)      concentrating said percolate to prepare polar solvent extract (iv)      triturating the above said extract successive with solvents of increasing polarity using hexane and chloroform,<br><br><br>
14.	A method as claimed in claims 1-13, wherein said fractions have<br>
concentration of:<br>
(a)	F001 - about 11 % (w/w),<br>
(b)	F002 - about 15% (w/w),<br>
(c)	F003 - about 40% (w/w),<br>
(d)	F004 - about 35% (w/w).<br>
15.	A composition useful as hepatoprotectant comprising extract of<br>
plant Cryptolepis buchanani and a method thereof substantially as<br>
herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
