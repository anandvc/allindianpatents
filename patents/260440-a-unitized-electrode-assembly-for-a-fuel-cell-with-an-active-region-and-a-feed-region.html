FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell and, more particularly, to a<br>
fuel cell unitized-electrode-assembly (UEA) having an electrolyte membrane with<br>
optimized dimensions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient and environmentally<br>
responsible power source for various applications. In particular, individual fuel<br>
cells can be stacked together in series to form a fuel cell stack capable of<br>
supplying a quantity of electricity sufficient to power an electric vehicle.<br>
Accordingly, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential alternative for a<br>
traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern vehicles. A common type of fuel cell is known as a proton exchange membrane<br>
(PEM) fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell includes three basic components: a cathode<br>
electrode, an anode electrode, and an electrolyte membrane. The electrodes<br>
typically include a finely divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon<br>
particles and mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is disposed<br>
between the electrodes and is generally formed from a proton-conducting<br>
polymer such as NafionÂ® polymer, commercially available from E.I. du Pont de<br>
Nemours and Company, for example. The electrolyte membrane and electrodes<br>
are disposed between porous diffusion media (DM). The DM facilitates a<br>
delivery of gaseous reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen, to the electrodes<br>
for an electrochemical fuel cell reaction. Generally, the catalyst is coated on the<br>
electrolyte membrane (CCM) to form a membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA).<br>
In another typical configuration, the DM is catalyst-coated (CCDM) to form the<br>
electrodes of the fuel cell. The electrolyte membrane, electrodes, and DM are disposed between a<br>
pair of fuel cell plates and sealed with a gasket. When the electrolyte membrane,<br>
electrodes, and DM are assembled as a unit, for example, with other components<br><br>
such as the gasket and the like, the assembly is called a unitized electrode<br>
assembly (UEA).<br>
 Each fuel cell plate has an active region to which the gaseous reactants<br>
are delivered for distribution to the electrodes. The fuel cell plate also includes a<br>
feed region having flow channels configured to deliver the gaseous reactants<br>
from a supply source to the active region. The electrolyte membrane typically<br>
extends across the feed region and terminates at the gasket. The electrolyte<br>
membrane is employed to separate and inhibit an intermixing of the gaseous<br>
reactants. However, the DM is generally limited to the active region so that there<br>
is adequate space for the gaseous reactants to flow through the flow channels in<br>
the feed region. The fuel cell may also include metal shims or foils in the feed<br>
region that provide a stiffness to the electrolyte membrane and that militate<br>
against a blockage of the flow channels by the membrane.<br>
 The electrolyte membrane in the feed region is typically coated or<br>
laminated with a chemically inert material to inhibit a corrosion of the fuel cell<br>
plates that contact the electrolyte membrane. However, both the electrolyte<br>
membrane and the inert materials are prone to swelling. Swelling of the<br>
electrolyte membrane is known to cause flow channel blockage, delamination<br>
from the metal shims, and result in fuel cell instability. The electrolyte membrane<br>
also is generally not compatible with certain fuel cell or automotive fluids, such as<br>
coolants, grease, and oil, with which the electrolyte membrane may come into<br>
contact during operation. The electrolyte membrane that extends into the feed<br>
region or to an outer perimeter of the fuel cell is particularly susceptible to<br>
contamination with these types of fluids.<br>
 There is a continuing need for a fuel cell having an electrolyte membrane<br>
with optimized dimensions. Desirably, the optimized membrane dimensions<br>
increase fuel cell robustness and reliability. The optimized electrolyte membrane<br>
also desirably reduces the fuel cell complexity and cost and improves<br>
manufacturability of the fuel cell.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 In concordance with the instant disclosure, a UEA that has an electrolyte<br>
membrane not substantially disposed in the feed region of a fuel cell, increases<br>
the fuel cell robustness and reliability by militating against flow channel blockage<br>
and corrosion of the fuel cell plate, and reduces the fuel cell manufacturing<br>
complexity and cost, is surprisingly discovered.<br>
 In one embodiment, a UEA is employed in a fuel cell having an active<br>
region and a feed region. The UEA includes an electrolyte membrane disposed<br>
between a pair of electrodes. The electrolyte membrane and the pair of<br>
electrodes are disposed between a pair of DM. The electrolyte membrane, the<br>
pair of electrodes, and the DM are configured to be disposed adjacent the active<br>
region of the fuel cell. A barrier layer coupled to the electrolyte membrane is<br>
configured to be disposed adjacent the feed region of the fuel cell.<br>
 In a further embodiment, a fuel cell includes the UEA disposed between a<br>
pair of fuel cell plates. Each of the fuel cell plates has an active region and a<br>
feed region. The electrolyte membrane, the electrodes, and the DM are<br>
disposed adjacent the active region. The barrier film is disposed adjacent the<br>
feed region. The dimensions of the electrolyte membrane are thereby optimized.<br>
 In another embodiment, a plurality of the fuel cells with the optimized<br>
electrolyte membrane may be stacked to form a fuel cell stack. The fuel cell<br>
stack has an enhanced robustness and reliability.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
 FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary fuel cell stack 2 according to the present<br>
disclosure. The fuel cell stack 2 has a pair of MEAs 4, 6 separated from each<br>
other by an electrically conductive bipolar plate 8. Although MEAs 4, 6 of a CCM<br>
design are shown for purpose of simplicity, it should be understood that the fuel<br>
cell stack 2 may employ a CCDM design if desired.<br>
 The bipolar plate 8 has an active region 9 and a feed region 10. The<br>
bipolar plate 8 may have a nested plate design, for example, as is described in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,974,648 and in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2006/0127706, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. For<br>
simplicity, only a two-cell stack (i.e. one bipolar plate) is illustrated and described<br>
in FIG. 1, it being understood that the typical fuel cell stack 2 will have many<br>
more such cells and bipolar plates.<br>
 The MEAs 4, 6, and particularly the electrolyte membranes of the MEAs 4,<br>
6, have optimized or "thrifted" dimensions that do not extend substantially beyond<br>
the active region 9. For example, the MEAs 4, 6 are substantially limited to the<br>
locations of the fuel cell stack 2 electrochemical reactions. It should be<br>
understood that the MEAs 4, 6 may be optimized on all edges, or on select<br>
edges, as desired.<br>
 The MEAs 4, 6 and bipolar plate 8 are stacked together between a pair of<br>
clamping plates 11,12 and a pair of unipolar end plates 14, 16. The clamping<br>
plates 11, 12 are electrically insulated from the end plates 14, 16 by a gasket or a<br>
dielectric coating (not shown). The unipolar end plates 14, both working faces of<br><br>
the bipolar plate 8, and the unipolar end plate 16 include flow fields 18, 20, 22,<br>
24. The flow fields 18, 20, 22, 24 distribute reactants, such as hydrogen gas, for<br>
example, from a compressed hydrogen source or a reformate, and oxygen, for<br>
example, from air over an anode and a cathode, respectively, of the MEAs 4, 6.<br>
 Nonconductive gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32 provide seals and an electrical<br>
insulation between the several components of the fuel cell stack 2. Gas-<br>
permeable DM 34, 36, 38, 40 abut the anodes and the cathodes of the MEAs 4,<br>
6. The end plates 14, 16 are disposed adjacent the DM 34, 40, respectively,<br>
while the bipolar plate 8 is disposed adjacent the DM 36 on the anode face of<br>
MEA 4. The bipolar plate 8 is further disposed adjacent the DM 38 on the<br>
cathode face of MEA 6.<br>
 Barrier films 42, 44 are positioned between the MEAs 4, 6 and the<br>
nonconductive gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32. The barrier films 42, 44 are disposed<br>
adjacent the feed region 10 of the bipolar plate 8. The barrier films 42, 44 are<br>
electrically nonconductive. The MEAs 4, 6 are coupled to the barrier films 42, 44.<br>
The barrier films 42, 44 may also be coupled to the nonconductive gaskets 26,<br>
28, 30, 32. In particular examples, the barrier films 42, 44 may be formed<br>
respectively integral with the nonconductive gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32. The barrier<br>
films 42, 44 may include at least one seal, for example, molded on the barrier<br>
films 42, 44 as seal carriers. It should be appreciated that having the seal<br>
formed on the barrier films 42, 44 may facilitate the employment of fewer<br>
components in assembling the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
 The bipolar plate 8, unipolar end plates 14, 16, and the gaskets 26, 28, 30,<br>
32 each include a cathode supply aperture 72 and a cathode exhaust aperture<br>
74, a coolant supply aperture 75 and a coolant exhaust aperture 77, and an<br>
anode supply aperture 76 and an anode exhaust aperture 78. Supply manifolds<br>
and exhaust manifolds of the fuel cell stack 2 are formed by an alignment of the<br>
respective apertures 72, 74, 75, 77, 76, 78 in the bipolar plate 8, unipolar end<br>
plates 14, 16, and the gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32. The hydrogen gas is supplied to<br>
an anode supply manifold via an anode inlet conduit 80. The air is supplied to a<br>
cathode supply manifold of the fuel cell stack 2 via a cathode inlet conduit 82. An<br><br>
anode outlet conduit 84 and a cathode outlet conduit 86 are also provided for an<br>
anode exhaust manifold and a cathode exhaust manifold, respectively. A coolant<br>
inlet conduit 88 is provided for supplying liquid coolant to a coolant supply<br>
manifold. A coolant outlet conduit 90 is provided for removing coolant from a<br>
coolant exhaust manifold. It should be understood that the configurations of the<br>
various inlets 80, 82, 88 and outlets 84, 86, 90 in FIG. 1 are for the purpose of<br>
illustration, and other configurations may be chosen as desired.<br>
 The barrier films 42, 44 are employed to separate the hydrogen gas and<br>
the air supplied to the fuel cell stack 2 in the feed region 10, particularly since the<br>
optimized MEAs 4, 6 are limited substantially to the active region 8. It is<br>
surprisingly found that joint configurations for the MEAs 4, 6 and barrier films 42,<br>
44, as described in various embodiments hereinafter, militate against a<br>
separation of the MEAs 4, 6 and the barrier films 42, 44 under typical fuel cell<br>
stack 2 operating conditions. The joint configurations may be employed to<br>
reliably couple the MEAs 4, 6 and the barrier films 42, 44, thereby enabling the<br>
use of optimized electrolyte membrane dimensions. At least one of bonding,<br>
such as with a chemical adhesive, fusing, and compression may be employed to<br>
further couple the MEAs 4, 6 and the barrier films 42, 44 under the joint<br>
configurations described.<br>
 In the various exemplary joint configurations shown in FIGS. 2a to 5d, a<br>
UEA 200 of the fuel cell stack 2 may include a barrier layer 202, an electrolyte<br>
membrane 204, a first electrode 206, a second electrode 208 at least one of a<br>
first joint film 210 and a second joint film 212, a first DM layer 214, and a second<br>
DM layer 216. The first electrode 206 and the second electrode 208 may be<br>
bonded to either the membrane 204 in a CCM configuration or one of the DM<br>
layer 214, 216 in a CCDM configuration as desired. Combinations of the joint<br>
configurations shown in FIGS. 2a to 5d, for example, having one configuration<br>
along the feed region 9 and another configuration along the active region 10 may<br>
also be employed. A skilled artisan should appreciate that the joint<br>
configurations described are for the purposes of illustration and that other<br>
suitable joint configurations may be selected as desired.<br><br>
 The barrier layer 202 corresponds substantially to one of the barrier films<br>
42, 44 shown in FIG. 1. The barrier layer 202 is formed from a material that does<br>
not substantially swell or degrade with exposure to the fuel cell reactants and<br>
automotive fluids, such as coolant, oil, and grease. In particular, the barrier film<br>
202 is formed from a material that is able to provide both electrical and<br>
mechanical separation. The barrier layer 202 may also be formed as a unitary<br>
layer to militate against delamination. As a nonlimiting example, the barrier layer<br>
202 is formed from one of a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), a polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET), and a polyimide polymer such as KaptonÂ® polymer<br>
commercially available from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, for<br>
example. It should be understood that other suitable polymeric materials for the<br>
barrier layer 202 may be selected as desired.<br>
 The electrolyte membrane 204, the first electrode 206, and the second<br>
electrode 208, when assembled, correspond substantially to one of the MEAs 4,<br>
6 described in FIG. 1. The first and second DM layers 214, 216 correspond<br>
substantially to the DMs 36, 38 disclosed in FIG. 1.<br>
 Referring now to FIGS. 2a to 2d, first, second, third, and fourth joint<br>
configurations, where the barrier layer 202 overlaps the electrolyte membrane<br>
204 to form a joint 218, respectively, are shown. Both the first DM layer 214 and<br>
the second DM 216 layer overlap the joint 218 in FIGS. 2a to 2c.<br>
 In the first joint configuration shown in FIG. 2a, an exposed portion 220 of<br>
the electrolyte membrane 204 extends beyond the first and second electrodes<br>
206, 208. The exposed portion 220 thereby provides a non-coated surface for<br>
coupling to the barrier layer 202. The barrier layer 202 is disposed on at least a<br>
portion of the electrolyte membrane 204 and may be bonded, for example, as<br>
described hereinabove. The first joint film 210 covers and seals an end of the<br>
first electrode 206 and the electrolyte membrane 204. As the first and the<br>
second electrodes 206, 208 are separated by the first joint film 210 and the<br>
barrier layer 202, respectively, contact between one of the electrodes 206, 208<br>
and the opposing DM 214, 216 is inhibited. A short circuit is thereby militated<br>
against.<br><br>
 The barrier layer 202, the electrolyte membrane 204, the first and second<br>
electrodes 206, 208, and the joint film 210 are layered between the first DM 214<br>
and the second DM 216. The first DM 214 and the second DM 216 overlap the<br>
joint configuration. The first and second DMs 214, 216 provide a mechanical<br>
pressure on the barrier layer 202 and the electrolyte membrane 204 when the<br>
fuel cell stack 2 is placed under compression during an assembly thereof. In<br>
particular embodiments, the mechanical pressure is sufficient to couple the<br>
barrier layer 202 and the electrolyte membrane 204 with or without a<br>
supplemental bonding such as by bonding with a chemical adhesive.<br>
 As shown in the second joint configuration of FIG. 2b, both the electrolyte<br>
membrane 204 and the second electrode 208 are disposed on a portion of the<br>
barrier layer 202. The barrier layer 202 is disposed between the second<br>
electrode 208 and the second DM 216. The exposed portion 220 of the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204 that extends beyond the first and second electrodes<br>
206, 208 is coupled to the barrier layer 202.<br>
 With reference to FIG. 2c, the third joint configuration includes the barrier<br>
layer 202 disposed between the second electrode 208 and the electrolyte<br>
membrane 204. It should be recognized that the second and third joint<br>
configurations do not employ the first and second joint films 210, 212, and<br>
therefore, may have a reduced manufacturing complexity.<br>
 In FIG. 2d, the fourth joint configuration includes the barrier layer 202<br>
disposed between the first DM 214 and the electrolyte membrane 204. The first<br>
DM 214 is catalyst coated to form the first electrode 206. The second DM 216 is<br>
also catalyst coated to form the second electrode 208 and the electrolyte<br>
membrane 204 disposed thereon, for example, by bonding before a cutting of the<br>
second DM 216. An edge of each of the electrolyte membrane 204, the<br>
electrodes 206, 208, and the DM 214, 216 are also aligned in the fourth joint<br>
configuration shown.<br>
 Exemplary fifth and sixth joint configurations are shown in FIGS. 3a and<br>
3b, respectively. In the fifth and sixth joint configurations, the barrier layer 202<br>
overlaps at least one of the first and second joint films 210, 212. At least one of<br><br>
the first and second joint films 210, 212 is further disposed on the exposed<br>
portion 220 of the electrolyte membrane 204. The first DM 214 and the second<br>
DM 216 sandwich the joint 218 formed by the overlapping of the barrier layer 202<br>
and at least one of the first and second joint films 210, 212.<br>
 In the fifth joint configuration shown in FIG. 3a, the exposed portion 220 of<br>
the electrolyte membrane 204 and the barrier layer 202 are layered between the<br>
first and second joint films 210, 212. The first joint film 210 is disposed above the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204 and the barrier layer 202 and is further disposed<br>
adjacent the first electrode 206. The second joint film 212 is disposed below the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204 and the barrier layer 202 and is further disposed<br>
adjacent the second electrode 208. The ends of the first and second electrodes<br>
206, 208 are sealed, respectively, by the first and second joint films 210, 212.<br>
 In FIG. 3b, the sixth joint configuration includes an overlapping of the first<br>
joint film 210 with each of the first electrode 206, the exposed portion 220 of the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204, and the barrier layer 202.<br>
 Seventh and eighth joint configurations are shown in FIGS. 4a and 4b.<br>
The seventh and eighth joint configurations include the barrier layer 202<br>
disposed outside of the first DM 214 and the second DM 216. In FIG. 4a, the first<br>
and the second joint films 210, 212 are disposed on the first and second<br>
electrodes 206, 208, respectively, and the exposed portion 220 of the electrolyte<br>
membrane 204. The exposed portion 220 terminates substantially at edges 222,<br>
224 of the first DM 214 and the second DM 216, respectively. The first and<br>
second joint films 210, 212 extend beyond the first and second DMs 214, 216<br>
and sandwich the barrier layer 202.<br>
 In the eighth joint configuration shown in FIG. 4b, only the first joint film<br>
210 overlaps a portion of the barrier layer 202 film outside of the first DM 214 and<br>
the second DM 216. The first and second DMs 214, 216 may be compressed at<br>
the edges 222, 224 thereof with the first joint film 210 to seal the exposed portion<br>
220 of the electrolyte membrane 204.<br>
 As the barrier layer 202 is not covered by the first and second DMs 214,<br>
216, the joint films 210, 212 may be bonded to the barrier layer 202 by means<br><br>
other than compressive force. A thickness of the barrier layer 202 in the seventh<br>
and eighth joint configurations may be greater than when the barrier layer 202 is<br>
layered between the DMs 214, 216. The thicker barrier layer 202 provides an<br>
improved stiffness that militates against blockage of flow channels in the feed<br>
regions 10 of the fuel cell stack 2. A skilled artisan should also appreciate that<br>
suitable thicknesses may vary with the fuel cell stack 2 design, and may be<br>
employed as desired.<br>
 Referring now to FIGS. 5a to 5d, exemplary ninth, tenth, eleventh, and<br>
twelfth joint configurations for the UEA 200 are shown, respectively. The barrier<br>
layer 202 is disposed in-line with one of the first DM 214 and the second DM 216.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the barrier layer 202 has a thickness that is<br>
substantially the same as a thickness of one of the first and second DM 214, 216.<br>
It should be understood that, having substantially the same thickness as the in-<br>
line DM 214, 216, a compressive force may be provided that is sufficient to seal<br>
the joint 218 between the barrier layer 202 and the electrolyte membrane 204,<br>
with or without supplemental bonding.<br>
 In the ninth joint configuration shown in FIG. 5a, the barrier layer 202 is<br>
disposed in-line with the first DM 214. A portion of the barrier layer 202 is<br>
layered with each of the first joint film 210, the exposed portion 220 of the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204, and the second DM 216. The first joint film 210 and<br>
the second joint film 212 sandwich the assembly of the first electrode 206, the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204, and the second electrode 208. The first and second<br>
joint films 210, 212 seal the first and second electrodes 206, 208, respectively.<br>
 The tenth joint configuration of FIG. 5b includes the barrier layer 202<br>
disposed in-line with the second DM 216. The barrier layer 202 is layered with<br>
the exposed portion 220 of the electrolyte membrane 204 and the first DM 214.<br>
The second electrode 208 terminates substantially at the edge 224 of the second<br>
DM 216.<br>
 In the eleventh joint configuration shown in FIG. 5c, a portion of the barrier<br>
layer 202 is disposed on each of the first joint film 210, the exposed portion 220<br><br><br>
of the electrolyte membrane 204, and the second DM 216. The eleventh<br>
configuration does not include the second joint film 212.<br>
 With reference to FIG. 5d, the barrier layer 202 is disposed in-line with the<br>
first DM 214. A portion of the barrier layer 202 is further disposed on each of the<br>
first electrode 206, the electrolyte membrane 204, and the second DM 216. The<br>
twelfth joint configuration according to FIG. 5d does not employ the joint films<br>
210, 212. It should be appreciated that the joint configurations of FIGS. 5c and<br>
5d, employing one or none of the joint films 210, 212, provides for less<br>
manufacturing complexity in comparison to the joint configurations having both<br>
joint films 210, 212.<br>
 It is surprisingly found that the joint configurations disclosed herein<br>
facilitate a bond between the barrier layer 202 and the electrolyte membrane 204<br>
that allows the dimensions of the electrolyte membrane 204 and the electrodes<br>
206, 208 to be optimized. In particular embodiments, the electrolyte membrane<br>
204 does not extend substantially into the feed region 10 of the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
Thus, the electrolyte membrane 204 does not become contaminated with fuel cell<br>
and automotive fluids such as coolant, grease, and oil, which the fuel cell stack 2<br>
may be exposed to in operation.<br>
 A skilled artisan should appreciate that at least one of the barrier layer 202<br>
and the joint films 210, 212 of the present disclosure, depending on the joint<br>
configuration selected, may also militate against a degradation of the electrolyte<br>
membrane 204 caused by the DM 214, 216. For example, the barrier layer 202<br>
and the joint films 210, 212 overlap the electrolyte membrane 204 and may<br>
inhibit a degradation or cutting by the DM 214, 216 edges 222, 224, when the<br>
components are placed under compression.<br>
 Various joint configurations according to the present disclosure may<br>
further minimize a volume necessary to form the bond, due to the elimination of<br>
supplemental adhesives. In particular embodiments, when the DM 214, 216<br>
overlap the joints 218 and the fuel cell stack 2 is placed under compression, a<br>
mechanical pressure sufficient to couple the barrier layer 202 and the electrolyte<br>
membrane 204 is provided. The coupling of the exposed portion 220 of the<br><br>
electrolyte membrane 204 to the barrier layer 202 may also provide a robust seal<br>
substantially impervious to the fuel cell stack 2 fluids.<br>
 A thickness of the barrier layer 202 may further be selected to militate<br>
against an undesirable over-compression of the joint 218 or an undesirable<br>
reliance on supplement bonding such as by chemical adhesion between the<br>
barrier layer 202 and the electrolyte membrane 204. The barrier layer 202<br>
thickness may be suitable for supporting one or more polymeric seals. The<br>
barrier layer 202, having a suitable thickness, also provides an improved stiffness<br>
to the feed region 10. The barrier layer 202 may militate against a blockage of<br>
flow channels in the feed regions 10 of the fuel cell stack 2, particularly if the<br>
barrier layer 202 is not otherwise supported, for example, with a metal shim. The<br>
barrier layer 202 minimizes to flow channel intrusions and the accompanying flow<br>
maldistribution throughout the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
 It should be appreciated that the barrier layer 202 is employed as a flow<br>
support for the hydrogen gas and the air because the gases flow thereover and<br>
are transported to and from the fuel cell stack 2 along the barrier layer 202. As<br>
the hydrogen gas and the air flow thereover, the substantially impermeable<br>
barrier layer 202 also advantageously resists a crossover and intermixing of the<br>
hydrogen gas and the air. The barrier layer 202 also militates against a short<br>
circuit of the fuel cell stack 2, for example, by providing an insulating layer<br>
between at least one of the first and second electrodes 206, 208, the first and<br>
second DM 214, 216, the first electrode 206 and the second DM 216, the second<br>
electrode 208 and the first DM 214, and the plates of the fuel cell stack 2, such<br>
as between bipolar plate 8, and one of the unipolar plates 14, 16.<br>
 It should also be understood that the optimized dimensions of the<br>
electrolyte membrane 204, which are facilitated by the joint configurations of the<br>
present disclosure, allows for an efficient use of the electrolyte membrane 204<br>
materials. A quantity of the electrolyte membrane 204 material employed<br>
according to the present disclosure may be minimized. Illustratively, electrolyte<br>
membrane 204 material along at least one of the active region 9 and the feed<br>
region 10 may be replaced with the barrier layer 202. Additionally, as the<br><br>
electrolyte membranes 204 may not extend substantially into the feed regions 10<br>
of the fuel cell stack 2, additional protective coatings and layers are not required<br>
to militate against corrosion of the bipolar plate 8, and unipolar plates 14, 16. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown<br>
for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
