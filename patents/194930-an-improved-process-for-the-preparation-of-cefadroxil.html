Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cefadroxil of the formula (I). More, particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cefadroxil having water content in the range of 4-5 %.<br><br>
Cefadroxil is chemically known as 7-[D-a-amino-a-(p-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-methyl-3-cephem»4-carboxylic acid. It is a well-known antibiotic substance having antibacterial activity and is disclosed in US Patent No. 3,489,752. US patent No. 3,985,741 discloses preparation of cefadroxil by acylation of 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) with the mixed anhydride of D-(-)-a-(p-hydroxyphenyl)glycine.<br>
US patent No. 4,504,657 claims a different form of cefadroxil that is the crystalline form of cefadroxil, known as cefadroxil monohydrate having a well-defined X-ray diffraction pattern. This crystalline cefadroxil monohydrate is<br>
obtained by acylation of silylated 7-ADCA acid with D(-)a-amino-a-(p-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl chloride hydrochloride.<br>
US patent No. 4,962,195 discloses yet another novel crystalline cefadroxil having water content of about 3% and characterized by distinct X-ray diffraction properties. This novel cefadroxil is called "cefadroxil hemihydrate" and is shown to be more stable than crystalline cefadroxil monohydrate.<br>
US patent Nos. 4,962,195 and 5,023,331 discloses a method of producing cefadroxil hemihydrate by adding to an aqueous solution containing cefadroxil prepared from 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid, a solvent selected from the group consisting of dimethylacetamide, monomethylformamide or N-methyl-<br><br>
2-pyrrolidone at a controlled pH (5.5 to 6.0) to give the corresponding cefadroxil solvate which precipitates and is filtered off. After the cefadroxil solvate is dried, it is slurred with a mixture of methanol-isopropyl alcohol 30:70 to 50:50 by volume at a temperature in the range of 45°C to 55 °C, to give crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate which is isolated by filtration.<br>
Both these patents report that the use of the cefadroxil solvates of dimethylacetamide, of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and of monomethylformamide is critical for the preparation of crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate and that it was impossible to obtain the desired crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate from the known cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,985,741, 4,504,657 and U.S. Pat. No. RE 31,730). It always resulted in the isolation of the known crystalline cefadroxil monohydrate due to the fact that the cefadroxil dimethyl    formamide    solvate    has    a   K.F.    value    of    1.8%    or   more.<br>
US patent No. 4,358,588 discloses a process for the preparation of cefadroxil comprising silylating 7-ADCA with silylating agent selected from trimethylchlorosilane and treating the resulting silylated ADCA with an equimolar amount of mixed anhydride in the presence of inert anhydrous, organic solvent.<br>
US patent No. 5,998,610 discloses a process for the silylation of 7-amino-desacetoxy-cephalosporanic acid by silylation in certain carboxylic acid esters and its use in the production of 6-alpha-aminoacyl-penicillins and 7-alpha-aminoacyl-desacetoxy-cephalosporins.<br>
US patent No. 6,337,396 discloses a method of producing crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate, from cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate which comprises slurrying cefadroxil dimethyl formamide solvate with a mixture of a lower alkanol and water, at a temperature in the range of about 40 °C to 50 °C and isolating the crystalline cefadroxil hemihydrate from the reaction mixture.<br>
US patent No. 5,329,001 disclose a method oT producing crystalline cefadroxil having a water content from about 0.8 % to about 3.9 %.<br><br>
Objective of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to provide a new method for the preparation of cefadroxil of the formula (I), having water content in the range of of 4-5 %.<br>

7-Amino desacetoxy cephalosporanic acid (100 gm) was taken in methylene chloride (275 ml), trimethyl silyl chloride (35.6 g) and hexamethyl disilazane (51 g) were added. The reaction mass was stirred for 120 - 130 minutes at 38 -46 °C to get silylated derivative of 7-aminodesacetoxy cephalosporanic acid, which was condensed with the mixed anhydride of D(-) a 4-hydroxyphenyl phenyl glycine Dane salt methyl, potassium, obtained by reaction of D(-) a 4-hydroxyphenyl glycine Dane Salt methyl, potassium (152 g) with methyl chloroformate (48 g) in a mixture of dichloromethane (530 ml) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (170 g), in presence of catalytic N-methyl morpholine (1.4 g) at -44 to -40 °C for 90-100 minutes. After completion of reaction, the reaction mass was subjected to hydrolysis in dilute hydrochloric acid (325 ml, 6.2 % aqueous hydrochloric acid). Aqueous layer was separated from the organic layer and to this N,N-dimethylformamide (1050 ml) was added. pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.6 - 6.0 with dilute ammonia (80 ml) at 24 - 32 °C to get cefadroxil DMF solvate, which was filtered and washed with aqueous DMF (100 ml) followed by acetone wash (400 ml). Cefadroxil DMF solvate was desolvated in purified water (300 ml) at 38 - 54°C for 90 - 120 minutes.  The<br><br>
product slurry was cooled to 10°C and filtered, washed with acetone (250 ml) and dried to get cefadroxil monohydrate (157-162 g), water content 4.7%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
