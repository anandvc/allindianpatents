The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. They are neuropeptide ligands, for example neuropeptide receptor antagonists and in particular, they are selective neuropeptides Y Y5 receptor antagonists.<br>
Neuropetide Y is a 36 amino acid peptide that is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This peptide mediates a number of physiological effects through its various receptor subtypes. Studies in animals have shown that neuropeptide Y is a powerful stimulus of food intake, and it has been demonstrated that activation of neuropeptide Y Y5 receptors results in hyperphagia and decreased thermogenesis. Therefore compounds that antagonise neuropetide Y at the Y5 receptor subtype represent m approach to the treatment of eating disorders such as obesity and hyperphagia.<br>
The current approach is aiming at medical intervention to induce weight loss or prevention of weight gain. This is achieved by interfering with appetite control, which is nediated by the Hypothalamus, an important brain region proven to control food intake, herein, neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been proven to be one of the strongest central nediators of food intake in several animal species. Increased NPY levels result in profound bod intake. Various receptors of neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been described to play a role n appetite control and weight gain. Interference with these receptors is likely to reduce ippetite and consequently weight gain. Reduction and long-term maintenance of body veight can also have beneficial consequences on con associated risk factors such as Lrthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and renal failure.<br><br>
Accordingly, the compounds of formula I, their salts and esters can be used in the prophylaxis or treatment of arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure and particularly eating disorders and obesity.<br>

Processes for the manufacture of compounds of formula I are an object of the invention.<br>
The substituents and indices used in the following description of the processes have the significance given above unless indicated to the contrary.<br>
Compounds of general formula IA (R = OR , A = CH2) can be prepared according to scheme 1 in two steps from (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methanol derivative A as follows:<br>
a)   For the conversion of A into (7-quinolylmethyl) ether B, A is reacted with a phenol derivative, R41-OH (R41 = aryl, heterocyclyl), in the presence of triphenylphosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate (e. g., diisopropyl azodicarboxylate) in a non-protic solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene at about room temperature (Mitsunobu-reaction, for a review see Org. React. 1992,42,335). Alternatively, A is treated with R41-X (R41is aryl or heterocyclyl and X is halogen, preferably F) or R^-Y (R42 is alkyl or cycloalkyl; Y is a leaving group, preferably Br or I) in the presence of a base, e. g., sodium hydride, in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, at temperatures<br><br>
between 20-100°C. Alternatively, the transformation of A into B is accomplished by cross-coupling reaction with an halide R41-X (R41 is aryl or heterocyclyl; X is hal, preferably Br or I), in the presence of a base, e. g., sodium hydride or sodium tert-butylate, and a palladium catalyst system, e. g.,<br>
tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipafladium(0) and2,2'-bis(ch-p-tolylphosphino)-l,r-binaphthyl (Tol-BINAP), in a solvent such as toluene, at about 50-100°C (/. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997,119,3395).<br>
b) The conversion of (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methyl ether B to compound IA is<br>
accomplished with an appropriate amine at temperatures between 0-200°C optionally in a sealed tube and/or under microwave irradiation, either using a large excess of the amine without solvent, or on reaction with a 2-20-fold excess, in a suited solvent such as ethanol or l-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, optionally in the presence of hthium chloride or sodium iodide and pyridine. In the case of R30 = halogen, the isomeric 2-aminoquinoline derivative, which may result as a side product, is separated from the desired 4-aminoquinoline, e. g., by chromatography or crystallization.<br>
Alternatively, the conversion (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methanol derivative A to IA can be accomplished via IB, by inverting the order of the reaction steps described above (scheme<br>
1).<br><br><br>
R30 is H, alkyi or halogen;<br>
The synthesis of (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methanol derivative A from 4-chloroquinoline C is outlined in scheme 2.<br>
a)	Cross-coupling reaction of C with a metal cyanide, e. g., potassium cyanide, in the<br>
presence of a palladium catalyst, e. g., tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and<br>
copper(I)iodide, in a solvent such as acetonitrile, at 80°C (J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63,<br>
8224), produces 4-chloroquinoline-7-carbonitrile D.<br>
b)	Alcoholysis of the cyano group of D, preferably in ethanolic or mefhanolic hydrogen<br>
chloride solution, at temperatures between 20°C and the boiling point of the alcohol,<br>
affords 4-chloroquinoline-7-carboxylic ester E.<br>
c)	Hydride reduction of E with a suited reagent, preferably with diisobutylaluminum<br>
hydride, in a solvent such as THF or dichloromethane, at temperatures between -78°C<br>
and +20°C, yields (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methanol A.<br><br>
Alternatively, A is obtained from D by a two-step sequence, in which the cyano group of D is reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofaran, at temperatures between -78°C and 0°C, and the 4-chloroquinoline-7-carbaldehyde (F) obtained is treated with sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol, at 0-20°C.<br>
Alternatively, a one-step conversion of C into E is accomplished by carbonylation, i. e., by reacting halide or triflate C with an appropriate alcohol (Ra-OH, where Ra is lower alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl), either using a large excess of the alcohol without solvent, or on reaction with a 2-10-fold excess, in a suited solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or methyl sulfoxide, under a carbon monoxide atmosphere at pressures between 1 and 100 bar, in the presence of a palladium catalyst system, e. g., palladium(II)acetate and triphenyl phosphine or bis(l,3-diphenylphosphino)propane, and a base, e. g., triethylamine, at about 40-80°C.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
R   is hydrogen, alkyl or halogen; Ra is methyl or ethyl; X is a leaving group, preferably I or OSO2CF3.<br><br>
The synthesis of quinoline-7-carboxamide compounds of the general formula IC from from 4-chloro-7-haloquinoline C is outlined in scheme 3:<br>

b)	4-Aminoquinoline-7~carbonitrile derivative H is produced from G by cross-coupling reaction with a metal cyanide, in analogy to the transformation of C into D, as described above.<br>
c)	Hydrolysis of H, e. g., with hydrogen peroxide and and potassium hydroxide, preferably in a two-phase mixture of water and dichloromethane and in the presence of a phase-transfer catalyst, e. g., tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, at a temperature of 0-20°C, yields primary amide ID.<br>
d)	Finally, the conversion of ID into IC is performed, either by reaction with a halide or sulfonate, R -Y (R   = (substituted) alkyl or cycloalkyl, Y = leaving group, preferably Br or I), in the presence of a base, e. g., sodium hydride, in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, at temperatures between 20-100°C, or by cross-coupling reaction<br>
with a halide, R41-X (R41 = aryl, heterocyclyl, X = halogen, preferably Br or I), in the presence of a base, e. g., cesium carbonate, and a palladium catalyst system, e. g., palladium(II)acetate and 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (Xantphos), in a solvent such as 1,4-dioxane, at about 50-100°C (Org. Lett. 2000,2, 1101).<br><br><br>
R   is hydrogen, alkjd or halogen; X is a leaving group, preferably I or OSO2CF3.<br>
*<br>
The synthesis of 4-aminoquinoline-7-carboxamide derivatives IE and (4-aminoquinolin-7-ylmethyl)amines IF is outlined in scheme 4:<br>
a)	Ester E is converted into the corresponding amide J by reaction with an appropriate<br>
amine, either using a large excess of the amine without solvent, or on reaction with a 2-<br>
10-fold excess of the amine, in a suited solvent such as ethanol or N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, at temperatures between 0°C and the boiling point of the amine<br>
or solvent.<br>
b)	The reaction of J with appropriate amines to produce IE is performed in analogy to the<br>
synthesis of IA from B as described above.<br>
c)	The conversion of IE into IF is accomplished by hydride reduction, e. g., with lithium<br>
aluminumhydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures between 0°C<br>
and the boiling point of the solvent<br><br><br>
R30 is hydrogen, aUcyi or halogen; Ra is methyl or ethyl.<br>
An alternative entry to compounds IF (especially preferred in the case of R5 = aryl or heterocyclyl) is outlined in scheme 5:<br>
a)	Oxidation of (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methanol A with manganese dioxide in a solvent<br>
such as dichloromethane or chloroform, at temperatures between 20°C and the boiling<br>
point of the solvent, affords quinoline-7-carbaldehyde derivative F.<br>
b)	Reductive animation of F, using an appropriate amine and a borohydride reagent, e. g.,<br>
sodium borohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, in a solvent system such as<br>
ethanol/ acetic acid, ethanol/aq. hydrochloric acid, or 1,2-dichloroethane/acetic acid, at<br>
0-20°C, affords (4-chloroquinolin-7-yl)methylamine K.<br>
c)	The reaction of K with appropriate amines to produce IF is performed in analogy to<br>
the synthesis of IA from B as described above.<br><br>
Alternatively, IF may be synthesized from alcohol IB by oxidation with manganese dioxide (according to step a), followed by reductive amination (according to step b)<br>

Quinoline derivatives IH (R ° = amino, alkoxy) can be prepared from 6-haloquinoline derivatives IG, by cross-coupling reaction with appropriate amines (R5-NH-R6) or<br>
A 2<br>
alcohols (IT-OH), in the presence of a catalyst system and a base as follows (scheme 6):<br>
a)  In the case of R   = alkoxy, the cross-coupling reaction is performed either by the Ullmann method, using a copper catalyst system, e. g., copper iodide with or without 1,10-phenanthroIine, and a base, e. g., sodium tert-butylate or cesium carbonate, in the<br>
alcohol, R43—OH, as the solvent, or in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide and at elevated temperatures (Synthesis 1998,1599 or Org. Lett. 2002,4,973), or by the Buchwald method, using a palladium catalyst system, e. g.,<br>
tris(dibeiizyhdeneacetone)dipaUadium(0)and2,2,-bis(di-p-tol)dphosphino)-l,r-binaphthyl (Tol-BINAP), in a solvent such as toluene, at about 50-100°C (J. Am. Chent Soa 1997,119,3395).<br><br>
b) In the case	= amino, the conversion is accomplished by Buchwald cross-<br>
coupling reaction in the presence of a suited catalyst system such as palladium(II)acetate and 2,2,-bis(diphenylphosphino)-l,l'-binaphthyl (BINAP) and a base, e. g„ sodium tert-butylate, in a solvent such as toluene, at 20-110°C (/. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 7240).<br><br>
R20 is alkoxy or amino; X is Cl, Br or I; R43 is alkyl.<br>
Quinoline derivatives IK can be prepared from 2-chloroquinoline derivatives IJ and appropriate amines, according to scheme 7, either in analogy to the synthesis of IA from B, or by Buchwald cross-coupling reaction, in analogy to the synthesis of IH from IG, as described above.<br><br><br>
Quinoline-7-carboxylic acid ester derivatives of general fornula IL can be prepared from compounds G by carbonylation, in analogy to the synthesis of C to E, as described above. Esters IL can then be converted to alcohols IB by hydride reduction in analogy to the synthesis of E to A, as described above.<br><br>
R30 is hydrogen, alkyl or halogen; Ra is methyl or ethyl; X is a leaving group, preferably I or OSO2CF3.<br>
The preparation of 4-chloroquinolines C is depicted in schemes 9 and 10 and involves the elaboration of 3-haloanilines or 3-benzyloxyanilines of formula L according to methods<br><br>
known in the art (for a general review see G. Jones, 'The chemistry of heterocyclic compounds, vol. 32: Quiniolines', Part I, J. Wiley and Sons, London, 1977).<br>
For the preparation of 4-chloroquinolines according to formula CI, 3-haloanilines or 3-benzyloxyanilines (L) are transformed as follows, depending on the nature of the substituent Rc at C(2) of the quinoline:<br>
a)	Rc = H: Condensation with a dialkyl ethoxy methylenemalonate at 140-150°C produces intermediate Ml, which is cyclized under elimination of one equivalent of alcohol (Ra-OH) on heating at about 250°C in a high boiling solvent such as Dowtherm® A or diphenyl ether. The 4-quinolone-3-carboxylic ester thus obtained is saponified (aqueous sodium hydroxide, reflux) and decarboxylated under thermal conditions (ca. 250°C) in a solvent such as DowthermB A or diphenyl ether to give 4-quinolone Nl (scheme 9).<br>
b)	Rc = alkyl: Condensation with appriopriate 3-ketoesters in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid, in refluxing cyclohexane and under azeotropic removal of the water produced during the reaction, affords intermediate M2. Subsequent ring closure under elimination of one equivalent of alcohol (Ra-OH) is achieved on heating at about 250°C in a high boiling solvent such as Dowtherm® A to give 4-quinolone Nl (scheme 9).<br>
The conversion of the quinolones Nl thus produced into 4-chloroquinolines CI is accomplished, e. g., with phosphorus oxide chloride and, optionally, in the presence of catalytic amounts of N,N-dimethylformamide, at about 50°C (scheme 9).<br><br><br>
Ra is methyl or ethyl; Rb is alkyl; Rc is H or alkyl; X is I, OCH2Ph or Br, preferably I or OCH2Ph.<br>
For the preparation of 2,4-dichloroquinolines of formula C2, two equivalents of 3-haloaniline or 3-benzyloxyaniline (L) are condensed with one equivalent of a dialkylmalonate at a high temperature (ca. 210°C) and under continuous removal of the two equivalents of alcohol (Ra-OH) released. The dianilide intermediate M3 is cyclized 01 heating at about 250°C in a melt of aluminum chloride and sodium chloride to provide th 4-hydroxy-2-quinolone of the general formula N2. Finally, chlorination with POCI3 produces the 2,4-dichloroquinolines C2 (scheme 10).<br>
Alternatively, 2,4-dichloroquinolines C2 can be synthesized in one step from anilines L, malonic acid, and POCI3 (L Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans 1 1993,2747).<br><br><br>
Ra is methyl or ethyl, X is I, OCH2Ph or Br, preferably I or OCH2Ph.<br>
Quinoline derivatives C3 or Gl, having a benzyloxy group at the C(7) position, can be<br>
*<br>
converted to the corresponding quinolin-7-yl triflates C4 and G2, respectively, via a two-step sequence outlined in scheme 11:<br>
a)	The benzyl ether moiety in C3 or Gl moiety is cleaved, e. g., either using a Lewis acid<br>
(preferably titanium(IV) chloride in dichloromethane, at about 0°C) or reductively (by<br>
hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e. g., palladium on activated<br>
charcoal, in a solvent such as methanol), to afford the corresponding quinolin-7-ol.<br>
b)	The quinolin-7-ol intermediates are converted into the corresponding triflates C4 or<br>
