SPECIFICATION METHOD FOR FORMING ORGANIC THIN FILM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for forming an organic thin film for forming an organic thin film on a substrate surface, particularly to an improved method for forming an organic thin film consisting of hydrolysable products of a metal surfactant.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, property modification of a surface of a substrate consisting of glass, metal, plastic or ceramics, is performed in various field, according to its purpose. For example, a method comprising coating a fluorine-containing silane coupling agent, in order to confer water repellency and oil repellency to the surface of glass or plastics can be exemplified. [0003]<br>
As a method for forming a coating film to improve a substrate surface, for example. Patent References 1 to 3 disclose a method for producing a chemisorbed film, which has high peel resistance and high transparence, and which gloss of the substrate surface and transparency of the substrate are not lost. However, the methods for producing a chemisorbed film described in these references comprise forming a coating by a dehydrochloric acid<br><br>
reaction of a chlorosilane surfactant and an active hydrogen of the substrate surface, which had drawbacks of generating a harmful chlorine gas when producing the film. [0004]<br>
A method for forming a chemisorbed film by a dealcohol reaction of alkoxysilane surfactant is also known. However, this method had drawbacks that the reaction velocity of dealcohol reaction is slow and that the film forming was not easy to conduct. [0005]<br>
Further, a method of promoting dealcohol reaction by using a dealcohol catalyst is proposed, while by merely adding a dealcohol catalyst, the surfactant will cross-link by itself due to the moisture in the air, thereby inhibiting the reaction in the solid-liquid interface of the substrate surface, and it was difficult to form a monomolecular chemisorbed film with good efficiency. [0006]<br>
In order to resolve these problems, in Patent Reference 4 is proposed a method for forming a chemisorbed film covalently-bond via a siloxane-bond, by allowing the substrate surface to contact with a mixed solution containing at least an alkoxysilane surfactant, a non-aqueous solvent not containing active hydrogen, and a silanol condensation catalyst. As a silanol condensation catalyst, at least one substance selected from metal carboxylate, metal carboxylate ester, metal carboxylate polymer, metal chelate carboxylate, titanate<br><br>
ester, and titanate ester chelate, is exemplified. [0007]<br>
Further, as a method for forming a chemisorbed film having crystalline property on a substrate surface, a method of forming a crystalline monomolecular film comprising developing an organic solvent solution of silane surfactant on a silicone wafer surface where purified water has been dropped, is disclosed in non-patent reference 1. [0008]<br>
Further, in Patent Documents 5 and 6, it is known a method for fixing a water-repellant coating film consisting of monomolecular layer, to a substrate surface via a silanol group, by using a monomer or polymer of a hydrolysate of fluoroalkyl group-containing silane compound which has been hydrolysed in the presence of an acid catalyst. [0009]<br>
However, this method requires a long time for film forming, and it had drawbacks such that when film forming is conducted while silanol condensation catalysts, etc, are remained in the solution, these catalysts inhibit the adsorption, and a dense monomolecular film could not be formed. Further, in these methods, the types of substrates which can be used are limited, and a crystalline chemisorbed film could not be formed on a non-crystalline substrate. [0010]<br>
Therefore,  particularly  in  the  field  of  fine<br><br>
patterning  in  the  design  of  electric  devices,  the development of a technology for quickly forming a dense monomolecular film with less impurity was awaited. [0011]<br>
Thus, the present inventors developed a method for reducing the film forming time, by using a solution for forming an organic thin film which moisture content has been adjusted or kept to be 50 to 1000 ppm, when allowing the substrate to contact with an organic solvent solution obtained by mixing a metal surfactant having a hydrolysable group and a catalyst that can interact with the metal surfactant, or with the solution for forming an organic thin film obtained from the organic solvent solution and the metal surfactant having a hydrolysable group (Patent Document 7). [0012]<br>
However, with this method, as catalysts tend to precipitate, etc. due to the high catalyst concentration, the solution for forming an organic thin film cannot be stored for a long time. Further, this method requires a long time for preparing an organic thin film since it cannot be carried out with a low amount of water. [0013]<br>

In the above method (i), reaction can be conducted after adding a certain amount of water at an arbitrary temperature, and then adding further water under a temperature condition of a temperature below the temperature at which hydrolysis starts, or preferably<br>
below -20^*0., [0075]<br>
A reaction of metal alkoxides and water can be performed by mixing directly metal alkoxides and water without using an organic solvent, but;it is preferred to conduct the reaction in an organic solvent.

As an organic solvent to be used, it is preferred that the hydrolyzed products of metal alkoxides may be dispersed as a dispersed material in the organic solvent, and a solvent which solubility to water is high and does not clot at a low temperature is more preferred, because the reaction of treating metal surfactant with water may be conducted at a low temperature.

(Preparation of the solution for forming an organic thin film)<br>
At the time the hydroxyl group-containing compounds increase with the progress of the hydrolysis reaction, and the  concentration  of  the  hydroxyl  group  achieves<br>
44<br><br>
equilibrium, the final solution for forming an organic thin film is adjusted by diluting the solution with an organic solvent to 1.5 to 200-fold/ preferably 2 to 100-fold, and more preferably 10 to 50-fold, The time period for that the concentration of the hydroxyl group achieves equilibrium is not particularly limited, but is 1 hour to 1 month, preferably 1 to 2 weeks.<br>
Herein, the state where the concentration of the hydroxyl group achieves equilibrium can be confirmed by reverse HPLC by using a metal surfactant before hydrolysis, for example, octadecyltrimethoxysilane as a standard, and measuring over time the peaks of the position corresponding to monosilanol. [0118]<br>
At the time the hydroxyl group-containing compounds increase with the progress of hydrolysis reaction, and the concentration of the hydroxyl group achieves equilibrium, the conversion ratio of the starting material metal surfactant to a hydroxyl group-containing compound is 5 to 50 wt%, preferably 8 wt% to 30 wt%.

The solution for forming an organic thin film of the present invention has an excellent preservation stability and it can form an excellent organic thin film even after a tightly sealed-storage for 40 to 6 0 days , at room temperature (20°C to 30°C). Specifically, as for the solution for forming an organic thin film of the present invention, the remaining level of the contained metal surfactant reduces slowly with the passage-of time after preparation, while the production level of the hydroxyl group-containing compound is almost constant. [0125]<br>
The reaction to generate a hydroxyl group-containing compound by the hydrolysis of the metal surfactant is an equilibrium reaction, and some of the hydroxyl group-containing compounds dehydrate and condensate to become high molecular with the passage of time, and it is considered that the metal surfactant hydrolyses in an-amount corresponding, to the consumed amount of the hydroxyl group-containing compound, to generate a hydroxyl group-containing compound. Further, when using the storage solution of the solution for forming an organic thin film, an excellent organic thin film can be formed. Thus, it can be considered that a high molecule (or oligomer) obtained by dehydration and condensation of a hydroxyl group-containing compound does not affect the formation of the organic thin film.<br>

with water.  The metal surfactant of tha.t state reacts with<br>
the active hydrogen on the substrate surface and a thin<br>
film if formed by forming a strong chemical bond with the<br>
substrate.  The thin film is formed by reacting with the<br>
active hydrogen of the substrate, and becomes a<br>
monomolecular film.<br>

a monomolecular film of 1 to 5 nm, preferably 1.5 to 2.5<br>
nm.<br>
[0140]<br>
The organic thin film formed by the method of forming I* an organic thin film of the present invention is preferably<br>
a chemisorbed film, and it is more preferred that the<br>
chemisorbed film has a crystalline property.  In that case,<br>
the  crystalline  property  may  be  multicrystal,  or<br>
raonocrystal.  As a chemisorbed film, an organic thin film<br>
covalently bond via metal-oxygen bond can be exemplified.<br>
[0141]<br>
The organic thin film formed by a method for forming an organic thin film of the present invention is.preferred to be a self-assembled film. Herein, a self-assembled film relates to a film having a methodical structure<br>
52<br><br>
without external forcing. Molecules forming a self-assembled film are obtained from a metal surfactant used for preparing a solution for forming a self-assembeld film. Molecules of a metal surfactant do not exist independently by being solvated by a solvent in a solution for forming a self-assembled film, but several molecules are assembled to form an aggregate. [0142]<br>
The form of the aggregate may be a form wherein molecules are assembled by intermolecular .force, coordination bond, or hydrogen bond of the hydrophobic moieties, or of the hydrophilic moieties; a form wherein the molecules forming a film are assembled by being bound by covalent bond; a form wherein the other media such as water form a micelle as a nucleus or an intermediate; or a combination of these. [0143]<br>
The shape of the aggregate is not particularly limited and it may be in a shape of sphere, chain, band, etc. The average particle diameter of the aggregate is not particularly limited, and the range of 10 to 1000 nm is preferred.<br>
[0144]<br>
The level of zeta potential {electrokinetic potential) of the aggregate is preferred to be greater than the level of zeta potential of the substrate in the same solvent. It is particularly preferred that the zeta potential of the aggregate is positive, and the zeta potential of the substrate is negative.   By using a<br>
53<br><br>
solution for forming a self-assembled film forming an aggregate  having  such  zeta  potential,   a  dense monomolecular film having a crystalline property can be produced. [0145]<br>
As it is stated in the above, by using the method of the present invention, a dense organic thin film with less impurity can be formed at a higher speed compared to the conventional metal surfactant regardless of the type of substrate. Such organic thin films are used for forming design pattern of electric devices, etc. and can be very<br>
easily  applied  for  equipments  which  require  a<br>
i<br>
heat-resistant,	weather-resistant,	and<br>
abrasion-resistant ultra thin film coating,  such as<br>
electrical appliances, car, industrial devices, mirror,<br>
optical lenses, etc.	^<br>
