				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION GLOGURg FOR CABLE CONNECTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a closure for protection of a connection section or splicing section of a communication cable such as an optical fiber cable or the like, and more particularly to an improvement in a closure for cable connection for an optical fiber cable.<br>
In general, a closure for cable connection includes end plates through which cables with a cable connection section being interposed therebetween are inserted and a cylindrical sleeve formed of two split parts so as to cover the cable connection section and constructed in a manner to be split in a longitudinal direction.  The two parts for the sleeve arranged between the end plates are joined to each other through abutting portions thereof opposite to each other using any suitable fixing means such as a bolt, a band or the like, resulting in providing the sleeve for airtightly protecting the cable connection section.<br>
The conventional sleeve thus constructed for protecting the cable connection section is required to exhibit rigidity sufficient to prevent deformation of the sleeve and properties sufficient to prevent intrusion of moisture thereinto.  For this purpose, the sleeve is so constructed that components of the sleeve are intimately or tightly coupled to each other and coupling between the cable and the sleeve is likewise tightly carried out.  Unfortunately, such construction of the conventional sleeve causes setting of the cable led out of the end plates and handling of the sleeve to be substantially troublesome.  Also, the conventional sleeve has another disadvantage of requiring a cable storage provided with an airtight member in order to ensure sufficient fastening of the cable.  However, this renders manufacturing of the sleeve troublesome and costly and deteriorates durability of the sleeve. Further, in order to ensure that the conventional sleeve exhibits satisfactory airtightness, force for fastening the end plates must be strictly controlled and assembling of the sleeve is rendered laborious and time-consuming.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a closure for cable connection which is capable of preventing deformation of a storage for a cable connection section.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a closure for cable connection which is capable of facilitating introduction and setting of a cable with respect to the closure while enhancing both safety and airtightness of the closure.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a closure for cable connection which is capable of readily and positively accomplishing fixing of a cable with respect to the closure.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a closure for cable connection which is capable of substantially increasing workability in assembling of the closure.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a closure for cable connection which is capable of being significantly simplified in construction and reduced in manufacturing cost.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a closure for cable connection is provided.  The closure for cable connection generally includes a pair of sleeve members which are formed with .a semicylindrical shape and joined to each other in a manner to be vertically separable from each other, resulting in providing a cylindrical sleeve for surrounding a cable connection section and have abutting joint surfaces formed on both sides thereof, through which the sleeve members are joined together; end plates arranged on opposite ends of the sleeve and each formed with at least one cable guide hole through which a cable connected to the cable connection section is inserted; hinges and fasteners releasably hooked between the sleeve members to integrally connect the sleeve members to each other through the abutting joint surfaces arranged opposite to each other; and at least one cable clamp arranged opposite to one of the end plates and provided with at least one cable insertion portion through which the cable is fittedly inserted.  In the closure of the present<br>
invention thus generally constructed, the end plates are each formed with a slit in a manner to extend from the cable guide hole to a portion of the end plate in proximity to an outer periphery of the end plate so as to permit a wall of the end plate to open by cutting along the slit.  The cable guide hole is provided thereon with a thin-wall cap capable of being removed by cutting and the slit is detachably fitted therein with a rigidity holding member.  The cable clamp includes a clamp body formed with at least one cable guide recess and a pivotal support.  The closure also includes at least one curved holding member which is arranged opposite to the cable guide recess and pivotally supported by the pivotal support.  The curved holding member is fastened at a free end thereof to the clamp body of the cable clamp by means of a mounting member.  The cable guide recess and curved holding member are detachably provided with split spacers in a manner to be opposite to each other, respectively.<br>
In the closure for cable connection according to the present invention thus constructed, a jacket is removed by a required length from a cable and an internal slot rod is cut off by a predetermined dimension from a position of the cable at which removal of the jacket was carried out, followed by adjusting of tension members in a predetermined dimension, resulting in preliminary arrangement for cable connection being completed.  Then, the jacket at a predetermined position of the cable is subjected to polishing and cleaning in a circumferential direction thereof and the rigidity holding member is removed from the cable guide hole of each of the end plates and then the thin-wall cap is removed from the cable guide hole and the slit is opened.  Then, the slit is expanded to guide the cable through the expanded slit to the cable guide hole, to thereby insert the cable through the cable guide hole.  Subsequently, the slit is mounted therein with a seal member and then fitted therein with an opening prevention connection member, to thereby keep the slit closed, followed by adhesion of a tape-like gasket to an outer periphery of the end plate so as to cover a portion of the slit positioned contiguous to the outer periphery while being conformed thereto.  Thereafter, spacers having an inner diameter required for the cable clamp are fitted in the cable guide recess<br>
and curved holding member to fasten the jacket at the end of the cable to the cable clamp and fasten the tension members to a cable tension member clamp of a tension member clamp.  Then, the upper sleeve member is pivotally moved about each of the hinges on one side of the lower sleeve member while being kept held on the lower sleeve member by means of the hinges, resulting in the upper sleeve member being placed on the lower sleeve member while forcing the end plates against the lower sleeve member. Thereafter, the fasteners are fastened in order from a central portion of the sleeve members, to thereby provide the closure. The closure thus assembled permits mounting of a cable seal member and that of the end plates to be strengthened while stabilizing a posture of the closure and airtightness of the closure to be highly increased, so that charging of gas into the cable connection closure through a valve ensures that it satisfactorily exhibits its inherent function.<br>
Also, release of the fasteners permits the upper sleeve member to be readily pivotally moved about the hinges, resulting in the sleeve being open, so that a cable connection operation in the closure may be facilitated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Now, a closure for cable connection according to the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring first to Figs. 1 to 6, an embodiment of a closure for cable connection according to the present invention is illustrated embodiment.  Generally, a closure for cable connection according to the illustrated embodiment includes a cylindrical sleeve constructed of a lower sleeve member 1 and an upper sleeve member 2, as well as end plates 3 respectively fitted in end fitment portions 3L provided on opposite ends of the sleeve in a longitudinal direction thereof.  The end plates 3 are each adapted to permit at least one trunk optical fiber cable 10 to pass therethrough.  The closure of the illustrated embodiment also includes at least one cable clamp 4 for securing the trunk optical fiber cable 10 with respect to the closure and at least one tension member holder 5 which is adapted to have a tension member (not shown) of the cable 10 connected thereto. The lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2 of the cylindrical sleeve are each made of a synthetic resin material such as, for example, PP resin, flame-retardant FRPP resin filled with glass fiber, a thermoplastic elastomer or the like with a semicylindrical shape and joined to each other so as to be vertically separable from each other, resulting in providing the cylindrical sleeve.  For this purpose, the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2 have abutting joint surfaces formed on both sides thereof, respectively, through which the sleeve members 1 and 2 are joined together.  The end plates 3 respectively fitted in the end fit portions 3L provided on both ends of the thus-formed cylindrical sleeve may each be made of a suitable rubber plate material such as an EPDM plate material or the like which satisfactorily exhibits desired properties such as weatherability, ozone resistant properties and the like.<br>
The abutting joint surfaces of each of the lower and<br>
upper sleeve members 1 and 2, including a portion thereof adapted to be brought into contact with an outer periphery of each of the end plates 3, are provided thereon with recessed grooves 6 in a manner to extend in a longitudinal direction thereof or in an axial direction of the sleeve, in which gaskets 7 are fittedly held as shown in Fig. 1.  The sleeve is provided therein with the cable clamp 4 in a manner to be opposite to one of the end plates 3.  The cable clamp 4 includes curved holding members 17 each of which is adapted to conform to an outer periphery of the cable. Also, the sleeve is provided therein with a connection fitment 8 including the tension member holder 5 and at least one tension member connector 9.<br>
The gasket 7 fitted in each of the recesses 6 on both sides of the lower and upper sleeve members I and 2 is made of an elastic material such as a rubber material or the like and formed with an elliptic configuration in cross section.  The gasket 7 is arranged in the recess 6 while being compressed in such a manner that a major axis of a cross section of the gasket 7 is rendered perpendicular to the abutting joint surface of the sleeve member or a width direction of the recess 6.  This results in sealing between the lower sleeve member 1 and the upper sleeve member 2 being provided.<br>
The recesses 6, as shown in Figs. 4 to 6, are each so formed that both ends thereof are reduced in width, to thereby provide a gasket press-fit portion 6: for pressedly fittedly holding the gasket 7 therein.  Thus, fitting of the gasket in each of the recesses 6 is carried out by pressedly fitting both ends of the gasket 7 in the gasket press-fit portions 6: of the recess 6 while elongating it, to thereby provisionally or temporarily fix the gasket 7 in the recess 6.  This results in fitting of the gasket 7 in the recess 6 being positively accomplished while preventing undesired missing of the gasket 7 from the recess 6 and leaning of the gasket 7.  The gasket 7 may be provided on each of both ends thereof with a flange ll as required.  The flanges 7: may be pressedly abutted against outer ends of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2, to thereby temporarily fix the gasket 7 in the recess 6.<br>
Also, the upper sleeve member 2 and lower sleeve member 1<br>
are each provided with barriers 65 at different portions thereof defined along the recesses 6 and on both side edges thereof deviated from each other in a longitudinal direction thereof. During assembling of both sleeve members I and 2 into the sleeve, the sleeve members are joined together while mutually abutting the barriers 65 of each of the sleeve members against an inner surface of the other sleeve member, resulting in deviation of the upper and lower sleeve members 2 and 1 from each other in a horizontal direction thereof being effectively prevented.<br>
The upper and lower sleeve members 2 and 1 are vertically separably joined to each other while interposedly sealedly holding the gaskets 7 therebetween and interposedly arranging sealing members between the sleeve members and the end plates 3, resulting in ensuring airtightness- in the closure.  The upper and lower sleeve members 2 and 1 are integrally connected to each other through the abutting joint surfaces thereof using fixing or fastening means.  More specifically, the upper and lower sleeve members 2 and 1 are integrally connected together by means of hinges 60 each formed of a loop-like ring 61 and fasteners 70 each formed of a loop-like ring 71.  The loop-like rings 61 and 71 are each arranged so as to releasably fasten the sleeve members 1 and 2 to each other.<br>
Also, the cable clamp 4 is mounted on each of both ends of the connection fitment 8 fixed with respect to the lower sleeve member 1 while being rendered opposite to an inner surface of one of the end plates 3 and then the tension member clamp 5 are mounted on the connection fitment 8 by means of fixing screws.  This results in ensuring distribution and guide of fiber cables for connection thereof.  Also, the sleeve is provided therein with at least one fiber cable storage unit such as, for example, at least one storage tray 15 so as to be positioned at a middle portion thereof.  Also, the sleeve is mounted thereon with the tension member connectors 9 as shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 4.<br>
Each of the end plates 3, as shown in Figs. 7 to 12, is constructed of a rubber elastic material of a round shape such as an elliptic shape, a prolonged oval shape, a circular shape or the like and formed with at least one cable insertion or guide hole 20.  In the illustrated embodiment, four such cable guide holes<br>
20 are provided.  The cable guide holes 20 may be formed with the same diameter or different diameters.  The end plates 3 are each provided thereon with caps 21 of a reduced wall thickness for covering the respective cable guide holes 20.  The caps 21 are each arranged on the end plate 3 in a manner to be capable of being removed by cutting from the end plate 3.  Also, the end plates 3 are each formed with slits 22 in a manner to correspond to the cable guide holes 20, respectively.  The slits 22 are each so arranged that one end thereof communicates with the corresponding cable guide hole 20 and the other end thereof extends to a portion of the end plate 3 in proximity to the outer periphery thereof.  Also, the slits 22 are each arranged so as to obliquely extend in a direction inclined with respect to a horizontal direction.  The slits 22 are each closed on one side thereof and at an outer periphery thereof with thin-wall elements 22., and 222/ respectively, when the cable 10 is not inserted through the cable guide hole 20 corresponding thereto.  When the cable 10 is inserted through the cable guide hole 20, the cap 21 for covering the hole 20 is removed by cutting and the thin wall elements 22: and 222 of the end plate 3 are cut open along the slit 22, resulting in an end of the slit 22 being enabled to be widely opened.  This permits workability of cable connection and airtight properties thereof to be significantly enhanced.<br>
Each of the slits 22 and each of the cable guide holes 20 which do not have a cable inserted therethrough are removably fitted therein with a rigidity holding seal member 25X and a rigidity holding member 25, respectively.  Also, each of the end plates 3 is formed 'on both lateral sides thereof with a pair of recesses 23.  The recesses 23 are each securely fitted therein with an opening prevention connection member 24, which is arranged so as to vertically extend over both sides of each slit 22, to thereby prevent opening of the end plate 3.  The end plate 3 is also formed at a central portion thereof interposed between the cable guide holes 20 in two pairs with a recess 28, which is securely fitted therein with a rigidity holding member 29, which is arranged so as to be abutted against an end wall of the sleeve.  The connection member 24 fitted in each of the recesses 23 functions as an opening prevention fitment for preventing<br>
opening of the outer periphery of the end plate 3 and displacement thereof, when the slit 22 is cut open or expanded to insert the cable 10 through the cable guide hole 20 and then closed again.  The opening prevention connection members 24 and rigidity holding member 29, which are respectively held in the recesses 23 and 28 formed on an outer surface of the end plate 3, are provided on surfaces thereof facing the end plate 3 with mating engagements 242 and 292, respectively.  The mating engagements 24, and 292 respectively engage with recesses 24X and 29: formed on the end plate 3, to thereby function to positively hold the members 24 and 29 on the end plate 3, so that the members may be substantially prevented from being released therefrom.<br>
Insertion of the cable through the end plate 3 is carried out by removing the rigidity holding member 25 from the cable guide hole 20 through which the cable is to be inserted, selectively removing the thin-wall cap 21 by cutting from the cable guide hole 20 to open the hole 20, cutting the thin wall elements 22X and 222 of the end plate 3 to the outer periphery of the slit 22 along the slit 22 communicating with the cable guide hole 20, to thereby enable an outer end of the slit 22 to be widely opened, and then laterally inserting the cable 10 through the opened slit 22 toward the cable guide hole 20.  Then, the cable is inserted through the cable guide hole 20, to thereby cause the slit 22 to be returned to the original configuration, into which the seal member 25X is inserted, followed by adhesion of the seal member 25: to the slit 22 by means of an adhesive as required.  Then, the opening prevention connection member 24 is mounted in the recess 23, so that both sides of the end plate 3 with the slit 22 being interposed therebetween are fastened. When the end plate 3 is formed with a small size, it is not necessarily required to arrange the rigidity holding member 25. Also, when the end plate 3 is provided with one or two such cable guide holes 20 in a manner to be positioned on a horizontal central line thereof, the slits 22 may be provided along the horizontal central line.<br>
Further, the end plates 3 are each provided on an outer peripheral surface thereof with a plurality of peak-and-valley<br>
shaped grooves 26 in a manner to extend in a circumferential direction thereof, to thereby permit compression force to be produced between the inner surface of the sleeve and the end plate 3, resulting in airtightness of the closure being enhanced. Also, such construction permits the compression force to be inwardly transmitted, to thereby provide satisfactory airtightness between the cable 10 and the end plate 3 at a cable lead-out hole or at the cable guide hole 20 thereof.  Thus, airtightness between each of the end fit portions 3: of the sleeve and the end plate 3 is held in such a manner that fastening force generated by the fastener 70 is received by the upper and lower sleeve members 2 and 1 and then transmitted therefrom to the peak-and valley shaped grooves 26 formed on the outer peripheral surface of the end plate 3.  This results in workability in assembling and disassembling of the closure of the illustrated embodiment being highly enhanced without any separate end plate gasket being required.<br>
The end plate 3 is provided on the inner surface thereof with a holder 31 in order to accomplish securer arrangement of the end plate 3 and prevent deformation of the end plate 3 due to application of any external force thereto.  For this purpose, the holder 31 is formed with a recess 30 in which a projection 40 provided on the cable clamp 4 is fitted, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Also, the end plate 3 is constructed so as to be accommodated to cables of different diameters.  To this end, as shown in Figs. 13A to 13C, a spacer 43 made of a rubber or resin material is used for adjusting a diameter of the cable guide hole 20 of the end plate 3 depending on a diameter of a cable to be inserted therethrough.  Alternatively, an airtight tape may be used for this purpose.  The spacer 43 or airtight tape is wound on the cable 10, resulting in ensuring intimate contact of an outer peripheral surface of the cable 10 with the cable guide hole 20.<br>
The spacer 43 arranged on the periphery of the cable led out of the sleeve, as shown in Figs. 13A to 13C, is formed with a hollow cylindrical shape and provided on one side thereof with a slit 44 for cable insertion, resulting in the spacer 43 being permitted to open on the one side thereof.  Also, the spacer 43<br>
is provided on inner and outer surface thereof with annular grooves 46 and 45 of a peak-and valley shape, respectively, to thereby ensure satisfactory airtightness of the spacer 43 and facilitate assembling and disassembling of the spacer 43 with respect to the cable 10.<br>
The spacer 43 is placed in a natural environment, therefore, it is constructed of a rubber material or the like which is shrinkable or expandable depending on an environmental temperature, to thereby minimize a variation in pressure between the outer periphery of the end plate 3 and the sleeve and between an inner periphery of the cable guide hole and an outer periphery of the cable, resulting in providing satisfactory compression force and preventing shrinkage due to a decrease in temperature. In order to ensure that the cable guide hole 20 of the end plate 3 permits cables 10 of different diameters to be selectively inserted therethrough without changing a diameter of the cable guide hole 20, a plurality of spacer 43 may be prepared by forming an outer diameter thereof the same as a diameter of the cable guide hole 20 and inner diameters thereof in correspondence to respective outer diameters of the cables.<br>
The cable clamp 4, as shown in Figs. 14 to 19C, includes a clamp body formed with a plurality of cable guide recesses 16 and the curved holding members 17 are each detachably and pivotally mounted on the clamp body by means of a pin 18 in a manner to be opposite to a corresponding one of the recesses 16. The curved holding members 17 are each formed with a shape which permits it to surround the outer periphery of the cable 10 in cooperation with a corresponding one of the recesses 16.  The curved holding member 17 is then secured or fastened to the clamp body of the cable clamp 4 by means of a screw 19 acting as a fastening member to hold the cable in a manner to interpose it between the clamp body and the curved holding member 17.  Thus, it will be noted that the cable clamp 4 facilitates clamping of the cable.  More particularly, the curved holding member 17 which is arranged opposite to a corresponding one of the cable guide recesses 16 is constructed into an arm-like member which is provided at one end thereof with the pin 18 for pivotal movement of the member 17 and at the other end or free end 17, thereof with<br>
a screw insertion hole 172 through which the screw 19 is inserted. The pin 18 is provided with two surfaces parallel to each other and detachably fitted in a release prevention mechanism provided at the cable clamp 4, resulting in the pin 18 being pivotally supported on the cable clamp 4.  In the illustrated embodiment, the release prevention mechanism is provided by holding recesses 18X each formed with a narrow opening which permits the two parallel surfaces of the pin 18 to be inserted therethrough into the holding recess 18^  The fastening member or screw 19 for fastening each of the curved holding members 17 is threadedly fitted in a pivotal element 19: pivotally supported on the cable clamp 4 and has a head 192 thereof held on the free end lll of the curved holding member 17.<br>
Also, the cable guide recess 16 and curved holding member 17 are provided on an inner surface thereof with a plurality of annular projections 182 and 173, respectively, resulting in recesses 37 being provided, in which recesses 37 split spacers 33 adapted to be pressedly abutted against a jacket of a cable are detachably fitted.  The split spacers 33 are each constructed of an arcuate element which is formed on an arcuate inner peripheral surface thereof with a groove 31 of a peak-and-valley shape and on an outer peripheral surface thereof with a flange 32.  The spacer 33 is provided on the outer peripheral surface thereof with a projection 34.  The spacers 33 are each detachably fitted in the recess 37 of the cable guide recess 16 or that of the curved holding member 17 while the projection 34 is fitted in a hole 36 formed in the cable guide recess 16 or curved holding member 17.<br>
Now, the hinges 60 and fasteners 70 will be more detailedly described with reference to Figs. 20A to 25B.<br>
One of the sleeve members 1 and 2 or the lower sleeve member 1 is formed at a portion thereof in proximity to one of the side edges thereof with a plurality of ring receiving projections 63 in a manner to be spaced from each other in a longitudinal direction thereof.  In each of the ring receiving projections 63, a hinge member comprising the loop-like ring 61 is pivotally arranged.  Also, the lower sleeve member 1 is provided at a portion thereof in proximity to the other side edge<br>
thereof with a plurality of fastener receiving projections 73, in a manner to be spaced from each other in the longitudinal direction thereof.  Further, the other or upper sleeve member 2 is provided at a portion thereof in proximity to one of the side edges thereof with a plurality of holding projections 631 in a manner to be spaced from each other in correspondence to the hinge members 61 and at a portion thereof in proximity to the other side edge thereof with a plurality of ring receiving projections 73 in correspondence to the fastener receiving projections 73L.  The loop-like rings 71 are each pivotally movably arranged in a corresponding one of the ring receiving projections 73.  The loop-like ring 71 is pivotally mounted thereon with an operation lever 75 provided at a distal end thereof with a holding projection 74.<br>
The fasteners 70 arranged on one side of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2, as shown in Fig. 24, each include the loop-like ring 71 made of a metal rod and fitted in a ring insertion recess 72 formed at the ring receiving projection 73 provided on one side edge of the upper sleeve 2, the pivotable operation lever 75 provided with the holding projection 74, and a holding recess 721 formed at the fastener receiving projection 73: provided on one side edge of the lower sleeve member 1.  The holding projection 74 of the operation lever 75 is disengageably held in the holding recess 72X, to thereby act as a supporting point.  Also, the hinges 60, as shown in Fig. 21, each include a the loop-like ring 61 made of a metal rod and pivotally arranged in a ring insertion portion 62 formed at the ring receiving projection 63 provided on the other side edge of the lower sleeve member 1 and a ring holding recess 62L which is formed at the hinge holding projection 63: of the upper sleeve member 2 and in which the other end of the loop-like ring 61 is detachably held. Such construction of the hinge 60 and fastener 70 facilitates connection and disconnection between the lower sleeve member 1 and the upper sleeve member 2.<br>
In addition, the loop-like rings 61 and 71 of the hinge 60 and fastener 70 arranged on the opposite ends of the sleeve in the longitudinal direction thereof are each movably provided with a retaining member 77 along an outer side of each of the gaskets<br>
7 so as to be fitted in a recess 76 formed by chamfering outer side edges of the abutting joint surfaces of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2.  The retaining member 77 may be constructed of, for example, a ring rod.  Such construction, when a sticky sealant is charged between the abutting joint surfaces of the sleeve members 1 and 2, effectively prevents runout of the sealant.<br>
Reference numeral 64 designates stoppers each arranged in the vicinity of the ring receiving projection 63 of the lower sleeve member 1.  The stoppers 64 each function to hold the loop-like ring 61 of the hinge 60 at a predetermined pivotal angle about the ring insertion portion 62.  Mounting of the upper sleeve member 2 to the hinges 60 is carried out by abutting the loop-like ring 61 against the stopper 64 to keep the loop-like ring 61 from being pivotally moved and then placing the upper sleeve member 2 on the lower sleeve member 1.  Then, the upper sleeve member 2 is raised about the gasket 7 positioned on a side of the hinges 60 to engage a free end of the loop-like ring 61 . with the ring holding recess 62X of the ring holding projection 63X.  This results in a plurality of the loop-like rings 61 being concurrently engaged with the ring holding recesses 6217 so that the lower and upper sleeve members I and 2 may be joined on one side thereof to each other through the hinges 60 by a one-touch<br>
operation.  Then, the sleeve members I and 2 are joined on the other side thereof to each other by means of the fasteners 70, as shown in Fig. 24.<br>
The stopper mechanism for the hinges 60 may be constructed of end surfaces of the sleeve members 1 and 2 rendered opposite to each other when both side edges of the members 1 and 2 are aligned with each other, rather than or in place of the above-described stoppers 64.  For this purpose, the end surfaces may each be partially formed into an outwardly downwardly slanting surface portion, so that an angle 6 of 30 to 90 degrees may be defined between both slanting surface portions and therefore between both end surfaces.  The end surfaces thus formed permit the slanting surface portions to be abutted against each other, to thereby function as the stopper mechanism, when both sleeve members I and 2 are relatively rotated in a direction<br>
of opening thereof.  This results in an angle of opening of the sleeve members 1 and 2 being restricted to a range of between 30 degrees and 90 degrees.  Such setting of the opening angle of the sleeve members 1 and 2 to the range substantially prevents excessive leaning of the upper sleeve member 2 toward a side opposite to that on which working takes places, to thereby ensure satisfactory workability.<br>
In order to ensure that the loop-like rings 61 and 71 of the hinge 60 and fastener 70 are used in a way common to both, the ring insertion portion 62 and ring holding recess 62: of the hinge 60 may be constructed in substantially the same manner as the ring insertion portion 72 and also, holding recess 72: of the fastener 70; and also, the ring receiving projection 63 and ring holding projection 63: of the hinge 60 may be constructed in substantially the same manner as the ring receiving projection 73 and fastener receiving projection 73X of the fastener 70.  This leads to simplification of a molding die for the sleeve members 1 and 2.  Also, the loop-like ring 61 and loop-like ring 71 may be constructed in substantially the same manner, resulting in being used commonly on both side edges of the sleeve.<br>
The tension member holder 5, as shown in Figs. 26A and 26B, is mounted thereon with a cable tension member clamp 51 of the single hole type or multi-hole type, which includes one or more cable insertion portions provided on a mount plate 49 through one or more arms 48.  The cable tension member clamp 51 is secured in the lower sleeve member 1 to hold the tension member of the cable.  For example, the cable tension member clamp 51 arranged in the sleeve member 1, as shown in Figs. 26A and 26B, may be constructed in such a manner that one or more insertion members 47 through which tension members are fittedly inserted are mounted on the mount plate 49 through the arm or arms 48.  The insertion members 47 are each provided with a fastening screw 50.  The cable tension member clamp 51 thus constructed is mounted on the tension member holder 5 to thereby facilitate application of tension to a center of one or more cables.<br>
Either the sleeve member 1 or 2 or the end plate 3 may be provided with a valve-equipped gas inlet (not shown), through<br>
which sealing gas is charged into the closure to ensure protection of the cable connection section in the closure.<br>
Now, the manner of assembling of the closure for cable connection according to the illustrated embodiment thus constructed will be described hereinafter.<br>
A jacket is removed by a required length from each of the cables 10 and an internal slot rod is cut off by a predetermined dimension from a position of the cable at which removal of the jacket was carried out, followed by adjusting of tension members in a predetermined dimension, resulting in preliminary arrangement for cable connection being completed.  Then, the jacket at a predetermined position of each cable 10 is subjected to polishing and cleaning in a circumferential direction thereof and the spacer 43 is fitted on the cable 10 or a cable seal material is wound on the cable 10.  The rigidity holding members 25 and 25j_ are respectively removed from the cable guide hole 20 and slit 22 of each of the end plates 3 and then the thin-wall cap 21 and thin walls 22l and 222 of the end plate 3 are respectively removed from the end plate 3 by cutting to open the cable guide hole 20 and slit 22.  Then, the slit 22 is expanded to guide the cable 10 through the expanded slit 22 to the cable guide hole 20, to thereby insert the cable 10 through the hole 20. Subsequently, the. slit 22 of the end plate 3 is mounted therein with the rigidity holding seal member 251 and then fitted therein with the opening prevention connection member 24, to thereby close the slit 22, followed by adhesion of a tape-like gasket to the outer periphery of the end plate 3 so as to cover a portion of the slit positioned contiguous to the outer periphery while being conformed thereto.  Thereafter, the spacers 33 having an inner diameter required for the cable clamp 4 are fitted in the cable guide recess 16 and curved holding member 17 to fasten the jacket at the end of the cable 10 to the cable clamp 4 by tightening the screw 19 at torque of a predetermined level and to fasten the tension members to the cable tension member clamp 51 of the tension member holder 5 by fastening the screws 50 at torque of a predetermined level.  Then, the gaskets 7 are interposedly arranged between the abutting joint surfaces of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2, and the upper sleeve<br>
ember 2 is pivotally moved about each of the hinges 60 on one side of the lower sleeve member 1 while being kept held on the lower sleeve member 1 by means of the hinges 60, resulting in the upper sleeve member 2 being placed on the lower sleeve member 1 while forcing the end plates 3 against the lower sleeve member 1 so that the abutting joint surfaces of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2 may be abutted against each other.  Then, the fasteners 70 are fastened in order from a central portion of the sleeve members to end portions thereof, to thereby provide the sleeve.  As required, the sleeve thus provided may be wound thereon with bands to keep airtightness over a whole length thereof, to thereby exhibit airtightness with high reliability.<br>
In the closure of the illustrated embodiment thus<br>
assembled, the gaskets 7 are each kept compressed in a major axis direction thereof between the abutting joint surfaces of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2, resulting in the closure exhibiting increased airtightness at relatively reduced clamping force.  Also, the spacers 43 are each interposedly arranged in an axial direction of the cable 10 between the end plate 3 and the cable 10 so as to act as a seal material, to thereby stabilize a posture of the sleeve members 1 and 2, facilitate assembling of the sleeve and enhance airtightness of the sleeve.  The gasket 7 is formed with an elliptic shape in section and arranged in the recesses 6 of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2 while conforming a major axis thereof to a direction of clamping force between the sleeve members so as to attain a lip seal effect, so that assembling of the closure may be facilitated and airtightness thereof may be increased.<br>
Now, the manner of disassembling of the closure will be described hereinafter.<br>
First, the operation lever 75 of each of the fasteners 70 is pivotally moved to disengage the holding projection 74 thereof from the fastener receiving projection 73: to release connection between the lower sleeve member 1 and the upper sleeve member 2, so that the upper sleeve member 2 may be readily pivotally moved about the hinges 60 for opening of the sleeve.  Then, the opening prevention connection members 24 are removed from each of the end plates 3, followed by separation of the sleeve members 1 and 2<br>
from each other, so that replacement of the cable 10 may be readily carried out.<br>
As described above, connection or fastening between the abutting joint surfaces of the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2 while ensuring intimate contact therebetween may be attained by means of the hinges 60 on one of both sides of the sleeve members and the fasteners 70 on the other side thereof, resulting in workability being significantly improved.  Also, rotation or pivotal movement of the upper sleeve member 2 about the hinges 60 in a closing direction thereof permits the gasket 7 in the recess 6 of the lower sleeve member 1 on the side of the hinges 60 to be automatically received in the recesses 6 of the upper and lower sleeve members 1 and 2 opposite to each other. The hinges 60 may be arranged on the upper and lower sleeve members 1 and 2 either securely or detachably.<br>
The storage tray 15 for the fiber cable storage unit described above may be arranged in a stationary manner for every one optical fiber ribbon so as to realize mounting of 5 to 20 ribbons per one tray.  In this instance, it is desirable that such storage trays are superposed in a multistage manner and connected together by the hinges so as to permit a tray at a position required to be open, to thereby improve workability.<br>
The illustrated embodiment is constructed so as to carry out connection and fastening between the sleeve members on only one side of the sleeve.  Such construction, even when a sufficient working space cannot be ensured on the other side of the sleeve, permits an assembling operation of the closure to be readily executed so long as a working space is maintained on the worker's side (the one side of the sleeve).  When the sleeve members 1 and 2 which are connected together by means of the hinges 60 and fasteners 70 are rendered open with respect to each other, the stopper mechanism provided for each of the hinges 60 restricts an angle of opening, between both sleeve members 1 and 2.  Thus, relative pivotal movement of both sleeve members in a direction of opening thereof is limited to a predetermined angle, resulting in eliminating a disadvantage of causing one of the sleeve members to be excessively open when the other sleeve member is engaged with the connection section, to thereby bepivotally moved toward a side opposite to a working side, leading to a deterioration in workability.Also, in the closure of the illustrated embodiment, the lower and upper sleeve members 1 and 2 are constructed into substantially the same configuration, so that mounting of fastener members and hinge members for connection between both sleeve members may be carried out without paying attention to discrimination between both sleeve members.  Also, this permits both sleeve members to be produced by means of a single molding die.<br>
The sleeve members may each be formed on both inner and outer surfaces thereof with a corrugated shape and made of a material exhibiting satisfactory compression set such as a styrene or olefin thermoplastic elastomer material.  Such construction permits manufacturing of the sleeve to be readily accomplished at a reduced cost and facilitates recovery and recycling of the sleeve because of any vulcanizing treatment being eliminated.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the closure for cable connection according to the present invention is constructed so as to generally include the pair of the sleeve members which are formed with a semicylindrical shape and joined to each other in a manner to be vertically separable from each other, resulting in providing the cylindrical sleeve for surrounding the cable connection section and have the abutting joint surfaces formed on both sides thereof, through which the sleeve members are joined together; the end plates arranged on the opposite ends of the sleeve and each formed with at least one cable guide hole through which a cable connected to the cable connection section is inserted; the hinges and fasteners releasably hooked between the sleeve members to integrally connect the sleeve members to each other through the abutting joint surfaces arranged opposite to each other; and at least one cable clamp arranged opposite to one of the end plates and provided with at least one cable insertion portion through which the cable is fittedly inserted; wherein the end plates are each formed with the slit in a manner to extend from the cable guide hole to a portion of the end plate in proximity to the outer periphery of the end plate so as to permit<br>
the wall of the end plate to open by cutting along the slit.  The cable guide hole is provided thereon with the thin-wall cap capable of being removed by cutting and the slit is detachably fitted therein with the rigidity holding member.  The cable clamp includes the clamp body formed with at least one cable guide recess and the pivotal support.  The closure also includes at least one curved holding member which is arranged opposite to the cable guide recess and pivotally supported by the pivotal support.  The curved holding member is fastened at the free end thereof to the clamp body of the cable clamp by means of the mounting member.  The cable guide recess and curved holding member are detachably provided with the split spacers in a manner to be opposite to each other, respectively.  Such construction of the present invention permits the sleeve members to be safely fastened to each other by means of the fasteners while abutting the abutting joint surfaces of the sleeve member against each other, resulting in facilitating both an operation of joining the sleeve members together and an operation of protecting the cable connection section, as well as ensuring satisfactory sealing with increased reliability due to uniform pressing against the end plates while minimizing the number of locations at which fastening is carried out.  Also, it ensures simplified handling of the closure and facilitates assembling and disassembling thereof while keeping a posture of the sleeve stable.<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity with reference to the drawings, obvious modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings.  It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
