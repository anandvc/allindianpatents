HETEROCYCLIC ASPARTYL PROTEASE INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to heterocyclic aspartyl protease inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds, their use in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cognitive and neurodegenerative diseases, and their use as inhibitors of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, plasmepsins, cathepsin D and protozoal enzymes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Eight human aspartic proteases of the A1 (pepsin-like) family are known to date: pepsin A and Cf renin, BACE, BACE 2, Napsin A, cathepsin D in pathological conditions.<br>
The role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in regulation of blood pressure and fluid electrolyte has been well established (Oparil, Sf etal. N Engl J Med 1974; 291:381 -401/446-57). The octapeptide Angiotensin-H, a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator for release of adrenal aldosterone, was processed from the precursor decapeptide Angiotensin-I, which in turn was processed from angiotensinogen by the renin enzyme. Angiotensin-fl was also found to play roles in vascular smooth muscle cell growth, inflammation, reactive oxygen species generation and thrombosis, influence atherogenesis and vascular damage. Clinically, the benefit of interruption of the generation of ahgiotensin-ll through antagonism of conversion of angiotensin-l has been well known and there are a number of ACE inhibitor drugs on the market. The blockade of the earlier conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin-l, i.e.the inhibition of renin enzyme, is expected to have similar but not identical effects. Since renin is an aspartyl protease whose only natural substrate is angiotensinogen, it is<br><br>
believed that there would be less frequent adverse effect for controlling high blood pressure and related symptoms regulated by angiotensin-ll through its inhibition.<br>
Another protease, Cathespin-D, is involved in lysosomal biogenesis and protein targeting, and may also be involved in antigen processing and presentation of peptide fragments. It has been linked to numerous diseases including, Alzheimers, . disease, connective tissue disease, muscular dystrophy and breast cancer.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Disease progression is associated with gradual loss of cognitive function related to memory, reasoning, orientation and judgment. Behavioral changes including confusion, depression and aggression also manifest as the disease progresses. The cognitive and behavioral dysfunction is believed to result from altered neuronal function and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The currently available AD treatments are palliative, and while they ameliorate the cognitive and behavioral disorders, they do not prevent disease progression. Therefore there is an unmet medical need for AD treatments that halt disease progression.<br>
Pathological hallmarks of AD are the deposition of extracellular P-amyloid (AP) piaques and iniraceiiuiar neurofibrillary tangles comprised of abnormally phosphorylated protein tau. Individuals with AD exhibit characteristic Ap deposits, in brain regions known to be important for memory and cognition. It is believed that AP is the fundamental causative agent of neuronal ceil loss and dysfunction which is associated with cognitive and behavioral decline. Amyloid plaques consist predominantly of Ap peptides comprised of 40 - 42 amino acid residues, which are derived from processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is processed by multiple distinct protease activities. AP peptides result from the cleavage of APP by P-secretase at the position corresponding to the N-terminus of Ap, and at the C-terminus by y-secretase activity. APP is also cleaved by a-secretase activity resulting in the secreted, non-amyloidogenic fragment known as soluble APP.<br>
An aspartyl protease known as BACE-1 has been identified as the p-secretase<br>
activity responsible for cleavage of APP at the position corresponding to the N-	
terminus of Ap peptides.<br>
Accumulated biochemical and genetic evidence supports a central role of Ap in the etiology of AD. For example, Ap has been shown to be toxic to neuronal cells in<br><br>
vitro and when injected into rodent brains. Furthermore inherited forms of early-onset AD are known in which well-defined mutations of APP or the presenilis are present. These mutations enhance the production of AfJ and are considered causative of AD.<br>
Since Ap peptides are formed as a result p-secretase activity, inhibition of BACE-1 should inhibit formation of A0 peptides. Thus inhibition of BACE-1 is a therapeutic approach to the treatment of AD and other cognitive and neurodegenerative diseases caused by AP plaque deposition.<br>
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). It has been clinically demonstrated that compounds such as indinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir which are inhibitors of the HIV aspartyl protease result in lowering of viral load. As such, the compounds described herein would be expected to be useful for the treatment of AIDS. Traditionally, a major target for researchers has been HIV-t protease, an aspartyl protease related to renin.<br>
In addition, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is a human retrovirus that has been clinically associated with adult T-cell leukemia and other chronic diseases. Like other retroviruses, HTLV-I requires an aspartyl protease to process viral precursor proteins, which produce mature virions. This makes the protease an attractive target for inhibitor design. Moore, et al. Purification of HTLV-I Protease and Synthesis of Inhibitors for the treatment of HTLV-I Infection 55th Southeast Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society, Atlanta, GA, US November 16-19,2003 (2003), 1073. CODEN; 69EUCH Conference. AN 2004:137641 CAPLUS.<br>
Piasmepsins are essential aspartyl protease enzymes of the malarial parasite. Compounds for the inhibition of aspartyl proteases piasmepsins, particularly I, II, IV and HAP, are in development for the treatment of malaria- Freire, et al. WO 2002074719. Na Byoung-Kuk, et al. Aspartic proteases of Plasmodium vivax are highly conserved in wild isolates Korean Journal of Prasttology (2004 June), 42(2) 61-6. Journal code: 9435800 Furthermore, compounds used to target aspartyl proteases piasmepsins (e.g. I, II, IV and HAP), have been used to kill malarial parasites, thus treating patients thus afflicted. Certain compounds also exhibited inhibitory activity against Cathespin D.<br>

BACE-1 Cloning, Protein Expression and Purification. A predicted soluble form of human BACE1 (sBACEl, corresponding to amino acids 1-454) was generated from the full length BACE1 cDNA (full length human BACE1 cDNA in pCDNA4/mycHisA construct; University of Toronto) by PCR using the advantage-GC cDNA PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A Hindlll/Pmel fragment from pCDNA4-sBACE1myc/His was blunt ended using Klenow and subcloned into the Stu I site of pFASTBACI(A) (Invitrogen). A sBACEImycHis recombinant bacmid was generated by transposition in DHIOBac cells(GIBCO/BRL). Subsequently, the sBACEImycHis bacmid construct was transfected into sf9 cells using CellFectin (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in order to generate recombinant baculovirus. Sf9 cells were grown in SF 900-11 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3% heat inactivated<br><br>
FBS and 0.5X penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). Five milliliters of high titer plaque purified sBACEmyc/His virus was used to infect 1L of logarithmically growing sf9 cells for 72 hours. Intact cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000xg for 15 minutes. The supernatant, containing secreted sBACEl, was collected and diluted 50% v/v with 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The diluted medium was loaded onto a Q-sepharose column. The Q-sepharose column was washed with Buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCI).<br>
Proteins, were eluted from the Q-sepharose column with Buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCI). The protein peaks from the Q-sepharose column were pooled and loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column. The Ni-NTA column was then washed with Buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCI). Bound proteins were then eluted with Buffer D (Buffer C+250 mM imidazole). Peak protein fractions as determined by the Bradford Assay (Biorad, CA) were concentrated using a Centricon 30 concentrator (Millipore). sBACEl purity was estimated to be -90% as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Commassie Blue staining. N-terminal sequencing indicated that greater than 90% of the purified sBACEl contained the prodomain; hence this protein is referred to as sproBACEl.<br>

As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.<br>
Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>
The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 1 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 50 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to about 25 mg, according to the particular application.<br>
The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 1<br><br>
mg/day to about 300 mg/day, preferably 1 mg/day to 50 mg/day, in two to four divided doses.<br>
When a compound of formula I is used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor to treat cognitive disorders, these two active components may be co¬administered simultaneously or sequentially, or a single pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I and a cholinesterase inhibitor in a pharmaceuticalty acceptable carrier can be administered. The components of the combination can be administered individually or together in any conventional oral or parenteral dosage form such as capsule, tablet, powder, cachet, suspension, solution, suppository, nasal spray, etc. The dosage of the cholinesterase inhibitor can be determined from published material, and may range from 0.001 to 100 mg/kg body weight.<br>
When separate pharmaceutical compositions of a compound of formula I and a cholinesterase inhibitor are to be administered, they can be provided in a kit comprising in a single package, one container comprising a compound of formula I in a pharmaceuticalty acceptable carrier, and a separate container comprising a cholinesterase inhibitor in a pharmaceuticalty acceptable carrier, with the compound of formula I and the cholinesterase inhibitor being present in amounts such that the combination is therapeutically effective. A kit is advantageous for administering a combination when, for example, the components must be administered at different time intervals or when they are in different dosage forms.<br>
While the present invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and variations thereof will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such alternatives, modifications and variations are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
