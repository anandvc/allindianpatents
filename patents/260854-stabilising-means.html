An example of a stationary platform is a floating drilling platform which is maintained in station over a drilling site.<br>
A particular application of the invention relates to a stabilising means which can be utilised with waterborne vessels. The stabilising means according to the invention utilises a gyroscopic system. Gyroscopic stabilising systems have been proposed in the past but because of their mass and the space required to accommodate them they have generally been limited to use with large vessels. However, more recently, the availability of rolling element bearings and closed ioop control devices have also reduced cost and possibly sire. The orientation adopted limits the axial bearing load that would otherwise be required to support . the rotor weight. It is the axial load that limits the speed of the rotor and hence the weight of rotor required. Examples of arrangements which have been proposed in the past are disclosed in GB 243316. US 5S28267. GB 581776, GB 1315119.<br>
Some arrangements which have been proposed In the past have provided that the gyroscopic arrangement actively cooperates with a set of foils and/or the rudder in order to control movement of the vessel while other arrangements comprise passive an'angements to control the rolling of the vehicle.<br><br>

Detailed Description of a Specific Embodimente<br>
The embodiments each relate to a stabilising means which is intended for use is association with a motor yacht, commercial transport vessel or military vessel, in the past the application of a stabilising means utilising a gyroscopic system has been impractical in motor yachts because of the mass of the system and the volume occupied by such systems and the difficulty of servicing the rotors of such systems. In motor yachts, a large proportion of their operating time is spent stationary or moving at low speeds and under these conditions the rolling action which can be applied to the vessel by sea conditions can be very undesirable. Therefore it is desirable to minimise the amount of rolling action applied to a vessel.<br>
The first embodiment as shown at Figures 1 to 5 comprises a stabilising means which is intended for installation in a motor yacht, commercial transport vessel or military vessel where the stabilisation axis is parallel to the fore and aft axis of the vessel. The stabilising means comprises a pair of housings 11 and 13 and each housing is provided with a rotor cover 15 supported from a base 17. Each rotor covers encloses a rotor 19 having a pair of trunnions which are rotatabiy<br><br>
supported from a cradle 23, The cradle 23 is comprises a pair of upstanding supports 25 supported from a base 31. The supports 25 are positioned in spaced relation across the base 31 of the cradle and are located to each side of the rotor 19. The upper end of each upstanding support is provided with a journal 27 which accommodates appropriate bearings which receive the trunnions 21 of the rotor to enable free rotation of the rotors on the upstanding supports 25 about first axes which are central to each rotor. Each rotor is associated with a hydraulic motor 29 supported from the upstanding supports 25 to cause the rotation of the rotors on the cradle 23. In the case of the first embodiment each base 31 is supported from a mounting 17 and the mountings are interconnected in a side by side relationship such that under operation the mean orientation of the first axes of rotation of the rotors are substantially co-linear. The drive which is provided by each of the motors 29 will cause rotation of each of the rotors about the first axes at substantially equal and constant angular speed however the rotation of the rotors are in opposite directions.<br>
Each cradle is supported from the respective mounting 17 to be able to rotate on the mounting about a second axis of rotation which is perpendicular to the respective first axis of the rotor and intersects the first axis of the respective rotor 19. The rotational support for each base on the mounting Is provided by a slewing bearing 33. The mountings 17 are fixed In a side-by-side relationship such that the first axes of rotation of the rotor 19 are coliinear and the embodiment is positioned within the vessel such that the first axes are abeam of the hull of the vessel.<br>
Each of the cradles 23 are interconnected by a pair of pulleys belts 35 which each pass around both cradles but which also belts crossover between the cradles. As a result of the arrangement of the pulleys rotation of one cradle will cause the opposite and equal rotation of the other <br>
In addition each cradle is associated with an second drive (not shown) which is associated with a sensor and an associated controller which is able to detect when the cradle may be subjected to a processional torque applied to the cradle by the respective rotor 19 and provide an indication of the magnitude of the<br><br>
torque. The sensor may Itself incorporate a gyroscope. The operation of the second drive is to overcome the inertial and/or friction forces which are applied to the cradle on application of a precessiona! torque from the respective rotor 19 and in order that the movement of the cradle is immediately responsive to the application of any such precessional torque, and to overcome the momentum contained in the cradle when the influence of the precessional forces has dissipated.<br>
In addition each cradle is associated with a braking means (not shown) which is adapted to apply a braking torque to the cradle on tho precessional notation of the cradle causing movement beyond a predetermined posftfon angularly spaced from the neutral position of the cradle, and/or is caused to move at a rate which is greater than desired.<br>
The second embodiment as shown at Figures 6 to 10 (the same reference numerals are used as those used in relation to the first embodiment for correspondlng components) comprises a stabilising means which is intended for instellation in a motor yacht, commercial transport vessel or military vessel where the stabilisation axis is parallel to the fore and aft axis of the vessel. The stabilising means comprises a housing 11 which covers encloses a pair of rotors 19 each having a pair of trunnions which are rotatably supported from their own cradle 23, The cradles 23 each comprises a pair of upstanding supports 25 supported from a base 31, The supports 25 are positioned in spaced relation across the base 31 of the cradle and are located to each side of the rotor 19, The upper end of each upstanding support is provided with a journal 27 which accommodates appropriate bearings which receive the tnjnnions 21 of the rotor to enable free rotation of the rotors on the upstanding supports 25 about first axes which are central to each rotor. Each rotor is associated with a hydraulic motor 29 supported from the upstanding supports 25 and connected to the respective rotor through a pulley drive to cause the rotation of the rotor on the cradle 23. In the case of the second embodiment each base 31 is supported from a common mounting 17 in a side by side relationship such that when operating the mean orientation of the first axes of rotation of the rotors are substantially co-linear. The drive which is provided by each of the motors 29 will cause rotation of each of the<br><br>
rotors about the first axes at substantially equal and constant angular speed however the rotation of the rotors are in opposite directions.<br>
Each cradle is supported from the mounting to be able to rotate about a second axis of rotation which is peipendicular to the respective first a&gt;ds of the rotor and intersects the first axis of the respective rotor 19. The rotational support for each base on the mounting is provided by a shewing bearing 33 between the respective base and the mounting. The cradles are fixed in a side-by-side relationship such that when operating the mean orientation of the first axes of rotation of the rotor 19 are colllnear and the embodiment is located within the vessel such that the mean orientation of the first axes are abeam of the hufi of the vessel.<br>
The base of each of the cradles are provided with a ring gear 41 which is concentric with the second axis and the ring gears of the cradles 23 are meshingly interconnected. As a result of the meshing interengagement of the cradles through the ring gears the rotation of one cradle will cause the opposite and equal rotation of the other cradle.<br>
In addition each cradle is associated with a second drive 43 which is associated with a sensor and an associated controller which is able to detect when the cradle may be subjected to a processional torque applied to the cradle by the respective rotor 19 and provide an indication of the magnitude of the torque. The sensor may itself incorporate a gyroscope. The second drive is operatively connected to a spur gear 45 meshingly engaged with one of the ring gears whereby on activation of the second drive the spur gear is driven to cause rotation of the cradles. The operation of the second drive is to overcome the inertia! and/or friction forces which are applied to the cradles on application of a precessionat torque from the respective rotor 19 and (n order that the movement of the cradle is immediately responsive to the application of any such precessionai torque. In addition the second drive can serve as a braking means to control the continued rotation of the cradles under the influence of the momentum induced into the cradle with precession of the rotors on the cessation of the application of the precessionai forces to the cradle<br><br>
In addition each cradle is associated with a braking means (not shown) which is adapted to apply a braking tonque to the cradle on the precessional rotation of the cradle causing movement beyond a predetermined position angularly spaced from the neutral position of the cradle, and/or is caused to move at a rate vi'hich is greater than desired, The braking means serves to supplement the braking that is applied by the spur gear 45.<br>
The third embodiment as shown at Figure 11 comprises a single rotor which corresponds to one rotor of the second embodiment and where vessel where the stabilisation axis is parallel to the fore and aft axis of the vessel. The mean orientation of the first axis of the rotor when operating is substantially perpendicular to the stabilisation axis<br>
In the case of the fourth embodiment as shown at Figure 12 which is a variation of the second embodiment in that while the rotors 19 are located in a side by side relationship along a central fore and aft axis of the hull of the vessel the first axes of rotation of the rotors are parallel and directed abeam across the vessel. The stabilisation axis is parallel to the fore and aft axis of the vessel.<br>
In the case of the fifth embodiment as shown at Figure 12 which is a variation of the second embodiment in that white the rotors 19 are located in a side by side relationship they are mounted to a common mounting 17 such that the cradles are supported from opposite sides of the common mounting and such that the first axes of rotation of the rotors are parallel.<br>
According to a sixth embodiment of the invention the second axes (being the axes of rotation of the cradle on the respective base) are directed abeam and the first axes of notation being the axes of rotation of the rotors are upright with respect to the hull of the.vessel.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of each of the above embodiments the rotors are driven by an eiectric motor.<br><br>
It will be understood that the mounting of each of the embodiments can be positioned to be lowemost or uppermost or at any angular position therebetween around the stabilisation axis.<br>
In each of the above embodiments described, when they are applied to a waterbome vessel, where the stabilisation axis comprise an axis which is parallel to the fore and aft axis of the vessel, the use of a pair of rotors which are rotating In opposite directions but at substantially equal angular spaed ensures that in the event of the vessel being subjected to a rolling action about the fore-aft axis of the vessel fr»e. rolling action will be in part negated by the corresponding precession of the rotors. In addition in the event of the hull under-going a rotational movement about an upright axis {i.e. tuming)frie torque generated will be equal arKl opposite between rotors thus causing no affect on the vessel. In addition in the event of the hull undergoing a rotational movement about a horizontal axis that is perpendicular to the stabilisation axis the resultant precessional movement of the rotors will counteract each other to have no substantia! effect on such rotation or stabilisation in the other axis.<br>
The configuration of the each of the embodiments provides a stabilisation means which differs from all of the known prior art in that it has a reduced profile since the support for the rotors is to one side of the axes of rotation of the rotors. Furthermore this arrangement provides for easier servicing of the rotors and replacement of the rotors and motors. As a result the stabilisers according to the embodiment can have application in smaller vessels than has been the case for prior art stabilisers.<br>
Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word 'comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>
