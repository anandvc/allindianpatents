METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING APPLICATION-SPECIFIC<br>
REGISTRATION OR DEREGISTRATION DATA AND SYSTEM, SERVER<br>
AND COMMUNICATION TERMINAL FOR THIS<br>
The invention relates to a communication system, to a<br>
method for controlling a communication system, to a<br>
server, to a method for operation of a server, to a<br>
communication terminal and to a method for operation of<br>
a communication terminal.<br>
Mobile radio communication systems based on the GSM<br>
(Global System for Mobile Communications) Standard<br>
allow not only voice communication links but also the<br>
transmission and reception of text messages with a<br>
length of up to 160 characters, by means of the SMS<br>
(Short Message Service).<br>
One possible successor to this simple and generally<br>
successful communication service is the MMS (Multimedia<br>
Messaging Service) which, for example, is described in<br>
[1] and [2] .<br>
MMS is a communication service which allows the mobile<br>
transmission and the mobile reception of messages with<br>
multimedia contents. A message transmitted by means of<br>
the MMS is referred to in the following text as a<br>
multimedia message (MM) .<br>
In contrast to SMS, the content of MMS transmitted<br>
messages is not restricted to a text length of 160<br>
characters.<br>
A multimedia message may have a plurality of multimedia<br>
elements, that is to say multimedia files, different<br>
file types (for example audio files or still image<br>
files) and different file formats (for example GIF or<br>
JPEG in the case of a still image file).<br><br>
MMS also allows the transmission of relatively small<br>
multimedia presentations with a fixed time and/or<br>
spatial sequence.<br>
At the request of operators of GSM communication<br>
systems, that is to say mobile radio communication<br>
systems according to the GSM Standard, MMS message<br>
classes have been defined for Version 1.2 of the MMS,<br>
which will be introduced to the market in the near<br>
future, for example as described in [3].<br>
The maximum amount of data which the multimedia message<br>
may contain is fixed for a multimedia message in a<br>
specific MMS message class. Furthermore, the file types<br>
and file formats that may be used for multimedia<br>
elements are fixed, in order that the multimedia<br>
message may contain these multimedia elements.<br>
File formats are typically specified by means of MIME<br>
(Multi Purpose Intermail Extensions) Content Types, as<br>
described in [4].<br>
On the initiative of the JAVA Community, in particular<br>
the JSR-2 05 Expert Group (see for example<br>
http://www.jcp.org/en/home/index), work has been<br>
carried out under the heading "Application Addressing<br>
Scheme" within the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership<br>
Project), with the aim of extending the communication<br>
protocol used for MMS, so MMS can be used by<br>
applications, that is to say software applications, as<br>
a transport medium (carrier) , that is to say files and<br>
data which are transmitted within an application can be<br>
transmitted by means of MMS.<br>
This will supposedly make it possible for applications<br>
within which data is transmitted by means of MMS to be<br><br>
installed both on a network element in a mobile radio<br>
network and on a mobile communication terminal.<br>
In order to allow the data transmission carried out<br>
within an application by means of MMS, the addressing<br>
of applications will supposedly be possible in the case<br>
of MMS, that is to say a multimedia message can be<br>
transmitted with the statement of an application<br>
address which is addressed as an application, and/or of<br>
an application identifier, which identifies an<br>
application, from a sender to the addressed or<br>
identified application.<br>
As soon as this is the case, files with file types or<br>
file formats which until now it has not been possible<br>
to transmit by means of MMS will supposedly be<br>
transmitted by means of MMS, supposedly because a large<br>
number of applications installed on mobile<br>
communication terminals will receive and/or transmit<br>
data of application-specific MIME content types.<br>
A large number of files will accordingly supposedly be<br>
transmitted by means of MMS, having file types and file<br>
formats which will be used by an application installed<br>
on a communication terminal, but which are not<br>
"normally" supported by the communication terminal,<br>
that is to say cannot be used, if the application is<br>
not installed on that communication terminal.<br>
A conventional MMS relay/server according to the MMS<br>
Standard cannot distinguish whether a multimedia<br>
message to be transmitted is a multimedia message which<br>
contains a file with a file type or file format which<br>
can be used by a communication terminal, that is to say<br>
processed, that is to say for example can be displayed<br>
on the screen of the communication terminal, or whether<br>
the multimedia message is used as a transport container<br><br>
and contains a file with a file type, and/or a file<br>
format which is specifically intended for an<br>
application installed on the communication terminal,<br>
and which can be processed by the communication<br>
terminal only by means of this application.<br>
In particular, it is possible for an MMS relay/server<br>
to delete the content of a multimedia message, on the<br>
assumption that the content of the multimedia message<br>
cannot be processed by the communication terminal, in<br>
the course of a so-called content adaptation process<br>
based on the information that it knows about a<br>
communication terminal, even though the content can be<br>
processed by at least one application which is<br>
installed on that communication terminal.<br>
The information that the communication terminal cannot<br>
process files of a specific file type can be known to<br>
an MMS relay/server in the course of a so-called<br>
UA Prof (User Agent Profile) of the communication<br>
terminal, which is a profile of the communication<br>
terminal, and, as part of its capability to adapt the<br>
contents of multimedia messages to the capability and<br>
characteristics of communication terminals, the MMS<br>
relay/server could delete files of this file type in<br>
multimedia messages since the MMS relay/server does not<br>
know that an application which can process these<br>
contents is installed on that communication terminal.<br>
This can result in considerable quality losses and data<br>
losses.<br>
This behavior of the MMS relay/server is particularly<br>
disadvantageous when the user of the communication<br>
terminal incurs costs for the transmission of<br>
multimedia messages because, for example, he is a<br><br>
subscriber to a value added service provider (VASP)<br>
using MMS as the transport medium.<br>
At the moment, there are a large number of MMS<br>
providers who do not yet make use of the capability for<br>
content adaptation. However, this will supposedly<br>
change with the introduction of MMS Version 1.2 in the<br>
near future.<br>
The minimum requirements and guidelines for the<br>
interaction between MMS mobile telephones and MMS<br>
servers are specified in document [3] .<br>
The various headers which are used to describe the<br>
structure of MIME (Multi Purpose Internet Mail<br>
Extensions) messages are specified in [4].<br>
The UA-Prof (User Agent Profile) is specified in [5] .<br>
UA-Prof has been standardized by the WAP (Wireless<br>
Application Protocol) Forum in order that information<br>
about the characteristics of a communication terminal,<br>
for example a mobile communication terminal, can be<br>
signaled to a server in a communication system. The<br>
characteristics of a mobile communication terminal,<br>
that is to say of a mobile radio communication<br>
terminal, in a mobile radio system can obviously be<br>
made known at the network end in this way. UA-Prof,<br>
which was originally developed for mobile browsers for<br>
the Internet, is currently also being used for other<br>
mobile communication services, that is to say mobile<br>
radio communication services, for example MMS.<br>
The UA-Prof Standard is currently being developed<br>
further by the OMA (Open Mobile Alliance).<br>
UA-Prof can also be used to signal additional<br>
characteristics of further components in a<br><br>
communication system to a server, for example a WAP<br>
gateway which is coupled between the server and a<br>
communication terminal and can handle, and in the<br>
process change, the data being transferred between the<br>
server and the communication terminal.<br>
According to the prior art, a so-called resultant<br>
profile is transmitted to the server for this purpose.<br>
However, the server does not know whether the<br>
information contained in the resultant profile<br>
specifies characteristics of the further components or<br>
of the communication terminal, but, clearly, all of the<br>
specified characteristics of the transmission chain<br>
between the communication terminal and the server will<br>
be considered as characteristics of the communication<br>
terminal, so that the transmitted resultant profile<br>
will be interpreted as a profile of the communication<br>
terminal.<br>
The document [6] describes the XML (Extensible Markup<br>
Language).<br>
[7] describes the interchange of MMS Protocol Data<br>
Units (PDUs) between a terminal and a network unit.<br>
Document [8] describes a language tag for use in<br>
situations in which it is desirable to indicate the<br>
language which is being used for an information object.<br>
[9] is a document from 3GPP, in which protocols and<br>
codecs are specified for the packet-switched streaming<br>
service (PSS).<br>
Document [10] discloses a method and an apparatus for<br>
intelligent transcoding, (that is to say conversion, of<br>
multimedia data between two network elements, with<br>
transcoding information being stored and transmitted.<br><br>
[11] discloses an apparatus and a method for the<br>
transmission of information by means of a communication<br>
link to a client, with the information being converted<br>
to a format on the basis of the characteristics of the<br>
client and of the communication link, and being<br>
transmitted using this format.<br>
Document [12] discloses a method for the transmission<br>
of a message with a specific content to a terminal, in<br>
which case a specific application service center uses a<br>
short message to inform the terminal of the nature of<br>
the message, and the specific application service<br>
center sends the message to the terminal or for example<br>
to a website, depending on the reaction of the<br>
terminal, for subsequent access by means of a password.<br>
[13] Discloses a method for provision of signals for a<br>
coded still image to a terminal, with a network element<br>
in a communication system receiving the signals, at<br>
least partially converting them, and sending them to<br>
the terminal.<br>
Document [14] describes a communication system in which<br>
a client unit transfers its data processing capability,<br>
for example the characteristics of the display unit of<br>
the client unit or else possible characteristics of a<br>
loudspeaker or in general of the data formats which can<br>
in each case be processed, to a data formatting unit.<br>
Multimedia data is converted on a client-specific basis<br>
by the formatting unit, in terms of the client<br>
characteristics, and is then transmitted to the<br>
respective client unit.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of making it<br>
possible to use MMS as a transport medium for an<br><br>
application which is installed on a communication<br>
terminal.<br>
The problem is solved by a method for control of a<br>
communication system, by a server, by a method for<br>
operation of a server, by a communication terminal and<br>
by a method for operation of a communication terminal,<br>
having the features of the independent patent claims.<br>
A communication system having a communication terminal<br>
and a server is provided, with the communication<br>
terminal having a signaling device which is configured<br>
to transmit application-specific registration or<br>
deregistration data, which is specific for an<br>
application installed or deinstalled on the<br>
communication terminal, to the server; and the server<br>
has a control device which is configured to carry out a<br>
control action as a function of the transmitted<br>
application-specific registration or deregistration<br>
data.<br>
Furthermore, a method for control of a communication<br>
system, a server, a method for operation of a server, a<br>
communication terminal and a method for operation of a<br>
communication terminal on the basis of the<br>
communication system described above are provided.<br>
One concept on which the invention is based can clearly<br>
be seen in the communication terminal registering an<br>
application which is installed on the communication<br>
terminal with, the server, or deregistering an<br>
application which is deinstalled on the communication<br>
terminal with the server.<br>
In this context, an application means a software<br>
application which is installed on the communication<br>
terminal, for example a games application in the course<br><br>
of which data is transmitted in order to allow the game<br>
to be played by a plurality of players, or a banking<br>
application which, for example, allows the instructions<br>
to be actioned securely.<br>
Preferred developments of the invention are specified<br>
in the dependent claims. The further refinements of the<br>
invention, which are described in conjunction with the<br>
communication system, also apply in the same sense to<br>
the method for control of a communication system, to<br>
the server, to the method for operation of a server, to<br>
the communication terminal and to the method for<br>
operation of a communication terminal.<br>
It is preferable for the server to have a transmission<br>
apparatus which is configured to transmit messages to<br>
the communication terminal, and has a conversion device<br>
which is configured to convert messages to be<br>
transmitted to the communication terminal, and for the<br>
control action to be the activation or the deactivation<br>
of a conversion by the conversion device of messages to<br>
be transmitted by means of the transmission apparatus<br>
of the server to the communication terminal.<br>
The server thus clearly preferably has a control unit<br>
which is configured to influence the activation or the<br>
deactivation of a conversion by the conversion device.<br>
The expression "control action" should thus be<br>
understood as meaning, for example, the activation or<br>
deactivation of a conversion of messages to be<br>
transmitted by means of the transmission apparatus of<br>
the server to the communication terminal, by the<br>
conversion device.<br>
A conversion of a message is, for example, a content<br>
adaptation of the message, for example the content<br>
adaptation in accordance with MMS, a change to the file<br><br>
type of a file contained in the message, or a change to<br>
the file format of a file contained in the message.<br>
The communication terminal clearly signals to the<br>
server that no conversion must be carried out for<br>
messages which are transmitted to the communication<br>
terminal. <br>
The control action preferably also includes the<br>
determination of which messages to be transmitted by<br>
means of the transmission apparatus of the server to<br>
the communication terminal must be converted (partially<br>
or entirely) by the conversion device.<br>
The communication terminal can signal which messages<br>
should be converted, for example all of the messages<br>
sent from one specific sender, all of the messages<br>
which contain files of a specific file type and/or file<br>
format, or all the messages which are transmitted at a<br>
specific time or within a specific time window.<br>
In particular, registration or deregistration of an<br>
application may comprise signaling that no conversion<br>
or that a conversion must be carried out on messages to<br>
be transmitted to the communication terminal, and/or<br>
which messages to be transmitted to the communication<br>
terminal should be partially or entirely converted.<br>
It is preferable for the conversion device to be<br>
configured to convert messages which are to be<br>
transmitted to the communication terminal by means of<br>
the transmission apparatus using a multimedia<br>
transmission protocol.<br>
It is preferable for the signaling device to be<br>
configured to transmit the application-specific<br><br>
registration or deregistration data to the server using<br>
a multimedia transmission protocol.<br>
The multimedia transmission protocol is preferably the<br>
MMS transmission protocol.<br>
A further concept on which the invention is based can<br>
be seen in the registration and deregistration of the<br>
application being carried out by means of MMS.<br>
If the invention is used for MMS purposes, an MMS<br>
relay/server cash, for example, be made aware that an<br>
application which MMS is using as a transport medium is<br>
installed on a communication terminal. This makes it<br>
possible, in particular, to avoid undesirable content<br>
adaptation of a message to be transmitted to the<br>
communication terminal by means of the MMS<br>
relay/server, for example the undesirable deletion of a<br>
file contained ;in the me-ssage to be transmitted and/or<br>
the undesirable conversion of the file type and/or of<br>
the file format of a file contained in the message to<br>
be transmitted, in the MMS relay/server, temporarily or<br>
permanently.<br>
In this case, the server is an MMS relay/server and may<br>
identify and provide separate handling for a multimedia<br>
message which contains data intended for an application<br>
installed on the communication terminal, on the basis<br>
of the message header of the multimedia message, in<br>
particular on the basis of message header fields which<br>
have been inserted specifically for the situation in<br>
which applications are being addressed in the<br>
multimedia message, and, for example, it can decide as<br>
explained above that this is not converted.<br>
Analogously, an MMS user agent which is installed on<br>
the communication terminal and is a software program<br><br>
installed on the communication terminal and allows the<br>
use of MMS on the basis of the message header of the<br>
multimedia message, in particular on the basis of<br>
message header fields which have been inserted<br>
specifically for the situation in which applications<br>
are being addressed in the multimedia message, can<br>
identify the application and not present this to the<br>
user, for example in the form of a graphics display,<br>
but pass them directly to the application.<br>
Alternatively or in addition to this, the MMS<br>
relay/server can also indicate to the MMS user agent by<br>
means of at least one new message header field in the<br>
message header of the multimedia message that the<br>
multimedia message should not be presented to the user,<br>
for example by being displayed graphically, or it<br>
should be passed on directly to the application.<br>
It is preferable for the signaling device to be<br>
configured to transmit the application-specific<br>
registration or deregistration data in the form of a<br>
profile of the communication terminal.<br>
The communication terminal therefore transmits a<br>
profile indicating that the communication terminal is<br>
able to process messages of a specific type, since an<br>
application is installed on the communication terminal<br>
and therefore, for example, the server need not convert<br>
these messages since, after conversion, it may possibly<br>
no longer be possible for them to be used by the<br>
application, resulting in loss of data.<br>
The profile preferably complies with the UA-Prof<br>
Standard, as described in [5].<br>
A further concept on which the invention is based may<br>
comprise registration of an application which is<br><br>
installed on the communication terminal or on some<br>
other unit in the communication system, for example an<br>
MMS relay/server, for the unit on which the application<br>
is installed.<br>
In one embodiment, which is described in the following<br>
text, this registration process comprises notification<br>
to the unit on which the application is installed (or<br>
the negotiation between the unit on which the<br>
application is installed and the application) of an<br>
application identification and/or an application<br>
address for the application, and possibly the transfer<br>
of additional information in the form of values of<br>
additional parameters from the application to the unit<br>
on which the application is installed. This additional<br>
information is used to control the bidirectional data<br>
interchange between the application and the unit on<br>
which the application is installed, for example when<br>
the application wishes to send (payload) data via MMS,<br>
or the unit wishes to pass on (payload) data received<br>
via MMS to the application.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be<br>
explained in more detail in the following text, and are<br>
illustrated in the figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a communication system according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>

Figure 1 shows a communication system 100 according to<br>
one exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The communication system 100 is designed on the basis<br>
of the MMS communication network architecture specified<br>
within the 3GPP.<br>
A first MMS user agent 101 is coupled to a second MMS<br>
user agent 104 by means of a first MMS relay/server 102<br>
and a second MMS relay/server 103.<br>
An MMS user agent 101, 104 is a software program which<br>
is provided, for example, on a mobile radio subscriber<br>
appliance, on an appliance connected to a mobile radio<br>
subscriber appliance, for example on a laptop or on<br>
some other communication terminal, and provides MMS,<br>
that is to say allows the use of MMS.<br>
The first MMS user agent 101 is coupled to the first<br>
MMS relay/server 102 by means of a first interface 105,<br>
which is annotated MM1.<br>
The second MMS user agent 104 is coupled to the second<br>
MMS relay/server 103 by means of a second interface<br>
106, which is likewise annotated MM1.<br>
The first MMS relay/server 102 is coupled to the second<br>
MMS relay/server 103 by means of a third interface 107,<br>
which is annotated MM4.<br>
The first MMS relay/server 102 is located in a first<br>
responsibility area (Multimedia Messaging Service<br>
Environment, MMSE) 108 of a first MMS service provider<br>
(MMS provider) , and the second MMS relay/server 103 is<br>
located in a second responsibility area 109 of a second<br>
MMS service provider.<br><br>
An MMS relay/server 102, 104 is a network element which<br>
provides the communication service MMS in the<br>
responsibility area 108, 109 of an MMS service provider<br>
to those MMS user agents which are located in the<br>
responsibility area 108, 109, that is to say which are<br>
provided on communication terminals which are located<br>
in the responsibility area.<br>
The first MMS user agent 101 is located in the first<br>
responsibility area 108, and the second MMS user agent<br>
104 is located in the second responsibility area 109.<br>
An MMS relay/server 102, 104 can adapt contents of a<br>
multimedia message to the capabilities and<br>
characteristics of a communication terminal, and this<br>
is referred to as content adaptation.<br>
By way of example, the first MMS relay/server 102 can<br>
delete a file of one file type or of one file format<br>
when it has the information that the communication<br>
terminal to which a multimedia message which contains<br>
this file is being transmitted cannot process files of<br>
this file type or of this file format.<br>
Another option for content adaptation is for an MMS<br>
relay/server 102, 104 to convert a file in a multimedia<br>
message which is being transmitted to a communication<br>
terminal or to a user agent which is provided on the<br>
communication terminal, that is to say to change the<br>
file such that it is of a file type and a file format<br>
which can be processed by the communication terminal.<br>
This conversion process is also referred to as<br>
transcoding.<br>
In this embodiment, the information about the<br>
capabilities and characteristics of the communication<br><br>
terminal which has the first MMS user agent 101 and<br>
about the second communication terminal which has the<br>
second MMS user agent 104 is respectively available to<br>
the first MMS relay/server 102 and to the second MMS<br>
relay/server 103 in the form of a communication<br>
terminal profile for the communication terminal in each<br>
case, which is designed in accordance with the UA Prof<br>
(User Agent Profile) Standard described below.<br>
Further servers 111 are coupled to the first MMS<br>
relay/server 102 by means of a fourth interface 110,<br>
which is annotated MM3. The further servers 111 are<br>
external servers which, for example, provide e-mail.<br>
communication services, fax communication services or<br>
UMS (Unified Messaging) communication services.<br>
From the point of view of the first MMS relay/server<br>
102, the second MMS relay/server 103 is operated by an<br>
external MMS service provider.<br>
The second interface 107 can thus be regarded as a<br>
means for linking external MMS service providers.<br>
An HLR (Home Location Register) 113 is coupled to the<br>
first MMS relay/server 102 by means of a fifth<br>
interface 112, which is annotated MM5.<br>
The HLR 113 is a part of a mobile radio communication<br>
system by means of which the first MMS relay/server 102<br>
communicates with the first MMS user agent 101, that is<br>
to say that the first interface 105 is provided by<br>
means of the mobile radio communication system.<br>
The first MMS user agent 101 is implemented on a<br>
subscriber appliance in the mobile radio communication<br>
system, with this mobile radio communication system<br>
having the HLR 113.<br><br>
The mobile radio communication system is, for example,<br>
designed in accordance with the GSM Standard or the<br>
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)<br>
Standard.<br>
The individual customer data for the user of the<br>
communication terminal on which the first MMS user<br>
agent 101 is implemented and embodied is stored in the<br>
HLR 113. The HLR 113 is typically located in the<br>
responsibility area of the mobile radio communication<br>
system, and this need not be identical to the first<br>
responsibility area 108 or to the second responsibility<br>
area 109.<br>
One (or more) MMS user database (or bases) 115 is (or<br>
are) coupled to the first MMS relay/server 102 by means<br>
of a sixth interface 114, which is annotated MM6.<br>
A value added service (VAS) server 117 for a value<br>
added service provider (VASP) is coupled to the first<br>
MMS relay/server 102 by means of a seventh interface<br>
116, which is annotated MM7.<br>
Value added services (VAS) are provided by means of the<br>
value added service server 117 to the user of the first;<br>
MMS user agent 101, and possibly to further users of<br>
the MMS which is provided by means of the first MMS<br>
relay/server 102. A value added service is a<br>
communication service which goes beyond the pure<br>
provision of a communication link, for example the<br>
transmission of share price or telephone number<br>
information.<br>
A billing system 119, which is used to gather and<br>
evaluate all of the relevant information for charging<br>
for the MMS, is coupled to the first MMS relay/server<br><br>
102 by means of an eighth interface 118, which is<br>
annotated MM8.<br>
A ninth interface 120, which couples the relay element<br>
121 of the first MMS relay/server 102 and the server<br>
element 122 of the first MMS relay/server 102, is<br>
annotated MM2.<br>
The communication system 100 may have further<br>
interfaces.<br>
Interfaces with the designations MM9 and MM10 are<br>
currently being discussed in the standardization<br>
committees.<br>
Figure 2 shows a message flowchart 200 according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The message flow illustrated in Figure 2 takes place<br>
between a first MMS user agent 201, a first MMS<br>
relay/server 202, a second MMS relay/server 203 and a<br>
second MMS user agent 204, which are arranged and<br>
designed as described above with reference to Figure 1.<br>
The message flow illustrated in Figure 2 is carried out<br>
by means of a first interface 205, a second interface<br>
206 and a third interface 207, which are arranged and<br>
designed as described with reference to Figure 1.<br>
The message flowchart 200 illustrates the message flow<br>
and the data interchange between the MMS user agents<br>
201, 204 and the MMS relay/servers 202, 204 during a<br>
transmission of a multimedia message 208. The message<br>
flow illustrated in the message flowchart 200 is<br>
configured on the basis of the 3GPP transaction<br>
flowchart, as is described by way of example in [2].<br><br>
In particular, the messages transmitted in the course<br>
of the described message flow are configured in<br>
accordance with the 3GPP abstract messages as defined<br>
in [2] .<br>
The messages transmitted in the course of the<br>
illustrated message flow each have at least one message<br>
header field (information element). In step 209, the<br>
first MMS user agent 201, which is the sender of the<br>
multimedia message 208, uses the first interface 205<br>
which, for example, is an air interface to send the<br>
multimedia message 208 to the first MMS relay/server<br>
2 02 by means of an MM1_submit.REQ message.<br>
In step 210, the first MMS relay/server 202 confirms<br>
correct reception of the multimedia message 2 08 from<br>
the first MMS user agent 201 by means of an<br>
MM1_submit.RES message.<br>
Analogously to step 209, in step 211, the multimedia<br>
message 208 is transmitted from the first MMS<br>
relay/server 202 to the second MMS relay/server 203 by<br>
means of an MM4_forward.REQ message, and to the second<br>
interface 206, and correct reception of the multimedia<br>
message 208 is confirmed in step 212 by the second MMS<br>
relay/server 203 by means of an MM4_forward.RES message<br>
and the second interface 206.<br>
The second MMS user agent 204, which is the recipient<br>
of the multimedia message 208, is informed in step 213,<br>
by means of an MM1_notification.REQ message and the<br>
third interface 207, that the multimedia message 208 is<br>
available for downloading.<br>
The MMl_notification.REQ message contains a reference<br>
to the memory location of the multimedia message 2 08 in<br>
the responsibility area (MMSE) to which the second MMS<br><br>
relay/server 203 belongs, in the form of a URI (Uniform<br>
Resource Identifier).<br>
In step 214, the correct reception of the<br>
MM1_notification.REQ message is confirmed by the second<br>
MMS user agent 204 by means of an MM1_notif ication. RES<br>
message and the third interface 207.<br>
In step 215, the second MMS user agent 204 uses an<br>
MM1_retrieve.REQ message and the third interface 207 to<br>
initiate downloading of the multimedia message 2 08<br>
provided in the second MMS relay/server 203.<br>
In step 216, the multimedia message 208 is passed from<br>
the second MMS relay/server 203 to the second MMS user<br>
agent 204 by means of an MM1_retrieve. RES message and<br>
the third interface 207.<br>
In step 217, the second MMS user agent 204 informs the<br>
second MMS relay/server 203 by means of an<br>
MM1_acknowledgement.REQ message and the third interface<br>
207 that the multimedia message 208 which was provided<br>
in step 216 has been output, that is to say about the<br>
output for downloading of the multimedia message 208.<br>
Further messages can also be interchanged in accordance<br>
with the MMS Standard.<br>
Figure 3 shows a message flowchart 300 according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The message flow illustrated in Figure 3 takes place<br>
between a communication terminal 301, a gateway<br>
computer 302 and a server 303.<br>
By way of example, the communication terminal 301 is a<br>
subscriber appliance in a mobile radio communication<br><br>
system in which subscriber appliance the first MMS user<br>
agent 101 is implemented, as described above with<br>
reference to Figure 1.<br>
The server 303 is, for example, the first MMS<br>
relay/server 102, which has been described above with<br>
reference to Figure 1.<br>
The gateway computer 302 is, for example, a gateway<br>
computer by means of which data is transmitted between<br>
the communication terminal 301 and the server 303, for<br>
example by being part of the first interface 105, which<br>
has been described above with reference to Figure 1<br>
(corresponding to the third interface 207 in Figure 2).<br>
By way of example, the gateway computer 302 is a<br>
wireless application protocol (WAP) gateway computer.<br>
Computer terminals such as the communication terminal<br>
301 typically differ from one another in terms of their<br>
characteristics and capabilities. For example, the<br>
characteristics of the display apparatuses of the<br>
communication terminals may differ in terms of the<br>
display size, the range of colors and the resolution of<br>
the display apparatuses, or the capabilities of the<br>
communication terminals to display and/or process files<br>
of a specific file type and/or file format.<br>
The message flow illustrated in Figure 3 is used to<br>
transmit information about the capabilities and<br>
characteristics of the communication terminal 301 to<br>
the server 303.<br>
This is done using a communication terminal profile<br>
which is configured in accordance with the UA Prof<br>
(User Agent Profile), which has been standardized by<br>
the WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) forum.<br><br>
Furthermore, the message flow is also used to signal to<br>
the server 303 the capabilities of the gateway 302<br>
which handles the data being transferred between the<br>
server 303 and the communication terminal 301, and<br>
which may also change.<br>
The following text refers to Figure 3 in order to<br>
describe how the current communication terminal profile<br>
of the communication terminal 301 is signaled to the<br>
server 303.<br>
In step 304, a basic profile BP of the communication<br>
terminal 301 or a reference to a basic profile BP for<br>
the communication terminal 301 is transmitted by means<br>
of a first message 313 to the gateway computer 302, for<br>
example during registration of the communication<br>
terminal 301 with the server 303 or when setting up a<br>
communication link between the communication terminal<br>
301 and the server 303.<br>
If the characteristics and/or the capabilities of the<br>
communication terminal 301 which are specified by means<br>
of the basic profile BP have been changed or extended,<br>
for example as a result of additional hardware being<br>
connected, the first message 313 is updated by also<br>
transmitting a first difference profile DP1 for the<br>
communication terminal 301 or a reference to a first;<br>
difference profile DP1 for the communication terminal<br>
301 to the gateway computer 302 by means of the first<br>
message 313 in step 304, in addition to the basic<br>
profile BP.<br>
This example assumes that a first difference profile<br>
DP1 is transmitted.<br><br>
The basic profile BP and the first difference profile<br>
DP1 can be temporarily stored and evaluated by the<br>
gateway computer 302 in step 305. The gateway computer<br>
302 can add a second difference profile DP2, which is<br>
produced by the gateway computer 302 itself, to the<br>
basic profile BP and the first difference profile DP1.<br>
This is done, for example, when the gateway computer<br>
302 has special characteristics and/or capabilities<br>
which differ from or complement characteristics and<br>
capabilities of the communication terminal 301 as<br>
specified by means of the basic profile BP and the<br>
first difference profile DP1.<br>
This example assumes that a second difference profile<br>
DP2 is produced.<br>
The basic profile BP, the first difference profile DP1<br>
and the second difference profile DP2 are transmitted<br>
to the server 303 by means of a second message 314 in<br>
step 306.<br>
In step 307, the server 303 uses the basic profile BP,<br>
the first difference profile DP1 and the second<br>
difference profile DP2 as the basis to produce a<br>
resultant profile for the communication terminal 301.<br>
If only references to profiles, instead of the profiles<br>
themselves, that is to say of the first basic profile<br>
BP or of the first difference profile DP1 or of the<br>
second difference profile DP2, have been transmitted in<br>
step 304 or in step 306, it may be necessary to<br>
dereference before the processing in step 305 by the<br>
gateway computer 302 and/or before the processing 307<br>
by the server 303, that is to say the referenced<br>
profile may need to be downloaded from other servers in<br>
which they are stored.<br><br>
The resultant profile, which specifies the individual<br>
characteristics of the communication terminal 301,<br>
which in this exemplary embodiment is WAP-compatible,<br>
and, if appropriate, the supplementary capabilities of<br>
the gateway 302 and/or of any other network element,<br>
represents the current communication terminal profile,<br>
and is managed by the server 303.<br>
While a communication link or. a communication session<br>
is in existence, the downloading of data can be<br>
initiated by the communication terminal 301 by sending<br>
a data request message. In step 308, the communication<br>
terminal 301 transmits a data request message 315 such<br>
as this to the gateway computer 302. This example<br>
assumes that the characteristics or capabilities of the<br>
communication terminal 301 have changed since step 304.<br>
The data request message 315 is therefore used to<br>
transmit an updated basic profile BP and a third<br>
difference profile DP3 to the gateway computer 302.<br>
Steps 310, 311 and 312 which are then carried out are<br>
carried out analogously to steps 305, 306 and 307.<br>
If characteristics and capabilities of the<br>
communication terminal 301 have not changed since step<br>
304, then no updated basic profile BP and no third<br>
difference profile DP3 are transmitted in step 308, and<br>
the steps which follow step 308 are based on the use of<br>
the profiles of the communication terminal 301 as<br>
transmitted in steps 304 to 307 and stored in the<br>
gateway computer 302 and/or in the server 303, for<br>
example the already determined resultant profile. If<br>
the profile which is stored in the gateway computer 302<br>
has likewise not changed since step 304, then the<br>
server 303 uses the profile of the communication<br>
terminal 301 as transmitted in steps 304 to 307.<br><br>
A resultant profile comprising a basic profile and any<br>
desired number of difference profiles is thus generated<br>
in the procedure explained with reference to Figure 3,<br>
in which case the data can also be transmitted between<br>
the communication terminal 301 and the gateway computer<br>
302 in the form of references to the basic profile and<br>
to any difference profiles. The volume of data to be<br>
transmitted by means of the air interface for the<br>
current communication terminal profile is furthermore<br>
minimized because an updated basic profile and/or<br>
difference profile need be transmitted only following a<br>
change in the characteristics and/or capabilities of<br>
the communication terminal 301.<br>
According to [5], the transmitted profiles, that is to<br>
say the basic profiles and the difference profiles, are<br>
configured on the basis of the metalanguage XML<br>
(Extensible Markup Language) , which is described by way<br>
of example in [6].<br>
Formats based on XML are highly suitable for<br>
interchanging structure data in a manner that: is<br>
independent of the platform and independent of the<br>
software. This applies in particular to the data<br>
transfer between programs and computers of different<br>
manufacturers and systems.<br>
A plurality of components can be specified by means of<br>
one communication terminal profile, in which case each<br>
component may have a plurality of attributes with the<br>
associated values. For example, the hardware component<br>
attributes are, for example, the screen size, the color<br>
capability, and their values.<br>
The profiles (basic profiles BP and difference profiles<br>
DP1, DP2, DP3) transmitted in the message flow<br>
illustrated in Figure 3, and the resultant profile, are<br><br>
configured, for example, as shown in Table 1, which<br>
shows the basic structure of a profile, as defined by<br>
the WAP Forum for the UA-Prof Standard in [5].<br><br>
Information blocks and individual information items<br>
within a profile are delineated from one another by<br>
means of so-called tags (marks).<br>
In the case of XML-based documents, most tags occur in<br>
pairs as start commands and end commands, and indicate<br>
the meaning of the text enclosed between them. The<br>
enclosed text may itself be subdivided by means of<br>
further tags, so that, for example, lists of parameters<br>
can be produced for one attribute. The details relating<br>
to attribute in an XML-based file are always enclosed<br>
by quotation marks ().<br>
This type of subdivision has the advantages that all of<br>
the components and attributes can be used and extended<br>
flexibly. Furthermore, this allows the structure of a<br>
profile based on the UA-Prof Standard to be extended as<br>
required, and allows simple graphics display.<br>
The data request message 315 transmitted in step 308<br>
is, for example, the MM1_retrieve.REQ message as<br><br>
described with reference to Figure 2 and transmitted in<br>
step 215.<br>
This message is produced at the transport protocol<br>
level, for example by means of the data request command<br>
"WSP GET" in the transport protocol WSP (Wireless<br>
Session Protocol) that is used for MMS or the data<br>
request command "http GET" in accordance with the http<br>
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) transport protocol that<br>
is used for MMS.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, and corresponding to step<br>
308, the respective data request command contains a<br>
basic profile and one or more difference profiles.<br>
Figure 4 shows a message flowchart 400 according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The message flow illustrated in Figure 4 takes place<br>
between an MMS relay/server 401, an MMS user agent 402<br>
and an application 403.<br>
The MMS user agent 402 and the application 403 are<br>
installed on a communication terminal 404. By way of<br>
example, the communication terminal 404 is a subscriber<br>
appliance in a mobile radio communication system.<br>
The MMS relay/server is, for example, arranged and<br>
configured analogously to the first MMS relay/server<br>
102, which has been described above with reference to<br>
Figure 1.<br>
The MMS user agent 402 is, for example, arranged and<br>
configured analogously to the first MMS user agent 101,<br>
which has been described above with reference to Figure<br>
1.<br><br>
The message flow is carried out by means of a first<br>
interface 405, which is configured analogously to the<br>
first interface 105 (or the third interface 207), which<br>
has been described above with reference to Figure 1 (or<br>
Figure 2, respectively), and a second interface 406,<br>
which forms the interface between the MMS user agent<br>
402 and the application 403.<br>
In order to use MMS as a transport medium, after<br>
successful installation of an application on a<br>
communication terminal or in general on an MMS unit,<br>
for example an MMS relay/server or a VASP server, the<br>
MMS unit allocates an application identification for<br>
that application, which identifies the application,<br>
and/or an application address, by means of which the<br>
application can be addressed, or the application<br>
signals to the MMS unit an application identification<br>
for the application and/or an application address for<br>
the application.<br>
If possible, the application identification and/or the<br>
application address which are used for referencing of<br>
the application and are used in particular for sending<br>
multimedia messages, indicating the application<br>
identification of the application and/or the<br>
application address of the application, to the<br>
application, are chosen uniquely.<br>
In one embodiment and if required, a unique application<br>
identification and/or application address for the<br>
application are/is negotiated between the application<br>
and the MMS unit.<br>
In one embodiment, the application identification<br>
and/or application address contain a hierarchically<br>
subdivided URI (Uniform Resource Identifier; reference<br>
to a memory location), in order to always still ensure<br><br>
second manual or automatic resolution, for example by<br>
means of a different application, in the possible event<br>
of failure of automatic resolution of the application<br>
identification and/or application address by the<br>
addressed MMS unit.<br>
In a further embodiment, the application identification<br>
and/or application address differs by at least one<br>
specific element (preferably by the last element or<br>
elements) in the hierarchical subdivision, so that, for<br>
example, the addressing of different instances for the<br>
same application is ensured by resolution of this<br>
specific element or these specific elements.<br>
In this embodiment, the application 4 03 preferably<br>
signals to the MMS unit, that is to say in this case<br>
the MMS user agent 402, an application identification<br>
and/or application address, which is known to the<br>
application 403, to the application 403, since in this<br>
way senders which transmit to the communication<br>
terminal 404 a multimedia message by means of which<br>
data is transmitted to the application 4 03 can use the<br>
application identification and/or the application<br>
address that is known by the application 403, and need<br>
not be informed about an application identification<br>
and/or application address which has been allocated to<br>
the application 403 by the MMS unit or has been<br>
negotiated by the MMS unit and the application 403.<br>
In another embodiment, the MMS unit manages the<br>
allocation of an external identification (that is to<br>
say a second application identification and/or<br>
application address), which is used for addressing of<br>
an application on the first interface 405, to the<br>
internally negotiated application identification and/or<br>
application address which is used for addressing on the<br><br>
second interface 406. However, this embodiment involves<br>
more complexity than the embodiment described above.<br>
It is assumed that, in step 407, the application 403<br>
has been successfully installed on the communication<br>
terminal 404.<br>
In step 408, the application 403 notifies the MMS user<br>
agent 402, by means of an appropriate message, of the<br>
application identification allocated to it, and/or of<br>
the application address allocated to it.<br>
Steps 409 and 410 are carried out optionally, for<br>
example being carried out or not carried out depending<br>
on the application 4 03 and the communication terminal<br>
404.<br>
In step 409, the MMS user agent 402	requests the<br>
application 403 to transmit additional	information,<br>
which the application 403 transmits to	the MMS user<br>
agent 402 in step 410.<br>
By way of example, in step 410 (or even in step 408),<br>
the application 403 could transmit the information to<br>
the MMS user agent 402 that the MMS user agent 402, on<br>
reception of an MM1_notification.REQ message by the MMS<br>
User Agent 402, should transmit the content of the<br>
message header fields of the MM1_notification.REQ<br>
message, which specify the sender address of the<br>
MM1_notification.REQ message and the reference of the<br>
MM1_notification.REQ message, to the application 403,<br>
or transmit to the MMS user agent the information that<br>
the MMS user agent 402 should automatically request a<br>
transmission report (delivery report) for the<br>
MM1_submit.REQ message if it sends a multimedia message<br>
by means of an MM1_submit.REQ message within the<br>
application 403. In general, the application in the MMS<br><br>
unit on which it is installed uses the interchange of<br>
additional information in step 410 (or even in step<br>
408) as described above to indicate what data it<br>
intends to transmit in what format (if the application<br>
initiates the sending of a 3GPP abstract message, as<br>
defined in [2], from the MMS unit) or what data it<br>
intends to receive in what format (if the application<br>
receives the data from the MMS unit from a received<br>
3GPP abstract message as defined in [2]).<br>
The additional information transmitted from the<br>
application 403 to the MMS user agent may also include<br>
a difference profile in accordance with the UA Prof<br>
Standard with information about the application 403,<br>
that is to say a difference profile for the application<br>
403, which is transmitted to the MMS relay/server 401<br>
in step 411.<br>
The transmission of difference profiles for<br>
applications overcomes the problem of undesirable<br>
content adaptation but only if all of the applications<br>
which transmit data by means of MMS produce difference<br>
profiles. It is therefore not preferable for difference<br>
profiles for applications to be transmitted within the<br>
transmitted additional information.<br>
Steps 411 and 412 are carried out differently,<br>
depending on the embodiment, in particular depending on<br>
whether steps 409 and 410 have been carried out.<br>
In one embodiment, the MMS user agent 402 uses a<br>
corresponding message produced in step 412 to inform<br>
the MMS relay/server 401, in step 412, that a new<br>
application 403, which uses MMS as the transport<br>
medium, has been installed on the communication<br>
terminal 404. This can be done, for example, by means<br>
of a basic profile or by means of a difference profile,<br><br>
depending on the time at which the application 403 was<br>
installed on the communication terminal 404, as has<br>
been explained above with reference to Figure 3.<br>
In one embodiment, the MMS user agent 402 transmits the<br>
application identification and/or the application<br>
address of the application 403 in step 412, by means of<br>
an appropriate message to the MMS relay/server 401.<br>
In one embodiment, the MMS user agent 402 uses a<br>
communication terminal profile which has been upgraded<br>
in comparison to [3] and is compliant with the UA Prof<br>
Standard which transmits the profile of the MMS user<br>
agent 402 to the MMS relay/server 401 to request that<br>
the conversion of files for a specific file type and/or<br>
a specific file format be temporarily or permanently<br>
switched off in the MMS relay/server 401 in the course<br>
of the content adaptation in accordance with MMS. In<br>
one alternative refinement of the invention, upgrading<br>
of this control information is envisaged for<br>
transmission of specific constraints from the MMS user<br>
agent to the MMS relay/server.<br>
When steps 409 and 410 have been carried out and the<br>
transmitted additional information includes a<br>
difference profile for the application 403, then this<br>
difference profile is evaluated in step 411, and/or is<br>
transmitted from the MMS user agent 4 02 to the MMS<br>
relay/server 401 in step 412.<br>
As mentioned above, this procedure allows the problem<br>
of undesirable contact adaptation to be solved reliably<br>
only when all of the applications reliably support the<br>
transmission of information by means of a difference<br>
profile in accordance with the UA Prof Standard.<br><br>
Since it may not be possible to ensure this in<br>
practice, the following embodiment is preferable, in<br>
which there is no need to transmit a difference profile<br>
from the application 403 to the MMS user agent 402.<br>
In step 411, the MMS user agent 402 inserts a first<br>
information element into a communication terminal<br>
profile, for example into a difference profile in<br>
accordance with the UA Prof Standard or into a basic<br>
profile for the communication terminal 404 in<br>
accordance with the UA Prof Standard, which information<br>
element indicates to the MMS relay/server 401 that it<br>
should (permanently or temporary) not carry out any<br>
conversion of files to be transmitted to the MMS user<br>
agent 402 of a specific file type and/or a specific<br>
file format. Provision is also made, in one alternative<br>
refinement of the invention, for additional constraints<br>
(for example in the form of further information<br>
elements) to be transmitted from the MMS user agent 402<br>
to the MMS relay/server 401, in order to influence the<br>
conversion process.<br>
Examples of a communication terminal profile	in<br>
accordance with the UA Prof Standard, into which	an<br>
information element has been inserted, are explained	in<br>
the following text with reference to Tables 2 to 4.<br>
The first information element may have further<br>
supplementary conditions and/or restrictions, for<br>
example the information that, from the time of<br>
transmission of the first information element to the<br>
MMS relay/server 401, the suppression of the conversion<br>
of the files which are transmitted to the MMS user<br>
agent 402 with a specific file type and/or a specific<br>
file format should in general not be carried out, or<br>
the information that the conversion of files with a<br>
specific file type and/or a specific file format which<br><br>
are transmitted to the MMS user agent 402 should not be<br>
carried out only in those situations when the files are<br>
used as the transport medium for the application 4 03<br>
during the course of use of MMS, or the information<br>
that the conversion of files with a specific file type<br>
and/or file format which are sent to the MMS user agent<br>
402 should not be carried out only when the multimedia<br>
messages which contain the files are transmitted from<br>
one specific, stated sender to the MMS user agent 402.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, in which the<br>
application 403 has been de-installed from the<br>
communication terminal 404, for example in step 407,<br>
and the application 403 has logged off from the MMS<br>
user agent 402, the MMS user agent 402 inserts a second<br>
information element into a difference profile in<br>
accordance with the UA Prof Standard in step 411,<br>
indicating to the MMS relay/server 401, after<br>
transmission of the difference profile to the MMS<br>
relay/server 401, that files of a specific file type<br>
and/or file format which are transmitted to the MMS<br>
user agent 402 should once again be converted from the<br>
time of transmission of the second information element.<br>
Once an appropriate communication terminal profile, for<br>
example a difference profile in accordance with the UA<br>
Prof Standard, has been produced by insertion of a<br>
first information element or by the use of the<br>
additional information transmitted to the MMS user<br>
agent 402 in step 410, has been produced in step 411,<br>
the communication terminal profile is transmitted from<br>
the communication terminal to the MMS relay/server 401<br>
in step 412.<br>
In one embodiment, in which the application 403 has<br>
been de-installed, no second information element is<br>
inserted into a difference profile and transmitted, but<br><br>
the first information element as described above is<br>
transmitted once again by means of a difference profile<br>
in which first information element, however, the value<br>
contained in a message header field has been modified<br>
in such a way that, after transmission of the first<br>
information element, this indicates to the MMS<br>
relay/server 401 that files with a specific file type<br>
and/or file format which are transmitted to the MMS<br>
user agent 402 should (once again) be converted from<br>
the time of transmission.<br>
Transmission of the communication terminal profile in<br>
step 412 thus results in the MMS relay/server 401<br>
knowing how it should handle multimedia messages<br>
transmitted to the communication terminal 404,<br>
particularly in the situation in which MMS is used as<br>
the transport medium for applications.<br>
By way of example, a multimedia message is transmitted<br>
from the MMS relay/server 401 to the MMS user agent 402<br>
in step 413.<br>
If steps 409 and 410 have been carried out, and if<br>
additional information has been provided to the MMS<br>
user agent 402 in the process specifying that the MMS<br>
user agent 402 should handle received multimedia<br>
messages in a stated manner, then the MMS user agent<br>
402 does this in step 414.<br>
In step 415, the MMS user agent 402 transmits the data<br>
contained in the received multimedia message for the<br>
application 403 to the application 403. By way of<br>
example, this may be the content of individual message<br>
header fields in the multimedia message, or the entire<br>
multimedia message.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the data transmitted in step 415 is<br>
dependent on the additional information interchanged in<br>
steps 408 and/or 410.<br>
Examples of communication terminal profiles in<br>
accordance with the UA Prof Standard into which<br>
information elements are inserted in the manner carried<br>
out for example in step 411, will be explained in the<br>
following text with reference to Table 2, Table 3,<br>
Table 4 and Table 5.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Tables 2 to 5 each show one possible refinement of a<br>
communication terminal profile that has been extended<br>
in comparison to [7].<br>
A communication terminal profile which has been refined<br>
according to Table 2 contain an XML attribute, which is<br>
new in comparison to [7], entitled MmsBearerForApplic<br>
which, when the communication terminal profile is being<br>
transmitted from a communication terminal to an MMS<br>
relay/server, is used to transmit the information that<br>
at least one application which uses MMS as the<br>
transport medium has been installed on that<br>
communication terminal.<br>
In another embodiment, the XML attribute is used to<br>
switch content adaptation on and off in the MMS<br>
relay/server.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In another embodiment, a communication terminal profile<br>
configured as shown in Table 3 is used. This<br>
communication terminal profile has an XML attribute<br>
which is new in comparison to [7] entitled<br>
MmsCcppAcceptApplic, which is used to transmit<br>
information from a communication terminal to an MMS<br>
relay/server as to which MIME content types are<br>
supported by an application installed on that<br>
communication terminal.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In another embodiment, a communication terminal profile<br>
which is transmitted from a communication terminal to<br>
an MMS relay/server is refined as shown in Table 4 . In<br>
this case the communication terminal profile has an XML<br>
attribute which is new in comparison to [7] entitled<br><br>
MmsSuppressContentAdaptationApplic by means of which it<br>
is possible to inform the MMS relay/server that content<br>
adaptation should not be carried out in the MMS<br>
relay/server when MMS multimedia messages are being<br>
used for transmission of application data by an<br>
application which is installed in that communication<br>
terminal.<br><br><br><br>
In another embodiment, a communication terminal profile<br>
which is transmitted from a communication terminal to<br><br>
an MMS relay/server is refined as shown in Table 5. In<br>
this case, the communication terminal profile has an<br>
XML attribute which is new in comparison to [7]<br>
entitled MmsSuportedAppplics, which can be used to<br>
indicate to the MMS relay/server a list of applications<br>
(application identification) which are installed on<br>
that communication terminal and (at present) use MMS as<br>
the transport medium (or in principle could use it,<br>
that is to say possibly intend to use it) . If<br>
appropriate, the MMS relay/server can use this<br>
information to suppress contact adaptation if it<br>
intends to send a multimedia message (MM) in which the<br>
application identification and/or the application<br>
address match/matches the application identification<br>
signaled by the terminal in accordance with Table 5.<br>
Tables 2 to 5 show text coding of attributes in<br>
accordance with the UA Prof Standard. According to [5],<br>
a binary notation is also possible, in which all of the<br>
text attributes are allocated binary tokens. In another<br>
embodiment a communication terminal profile is used<br>
which has been binary-coded in this way and complies<br>
with the UA Prof Standard.<br><br>
