FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and pharmaceutical formulations that can be used to treat conditions mediated by nuclear hormone receptors, more specifically, to compounds and pharmaceutical formulations that modulate Peroxisome Prohferator Activation Receptor (PPAR) activity<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hypercholesterolemia, dyslipiderrua, diabetes, and obesity are well-recognized nsk factors in the onset of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The diseases are characterized by high levels of cholesterol and lipids in the blood. The blood cholesterol pool is generally dependent on dietary uptake of cholesterol from the intestine, and from the biosynthesis of cholesterol throughout the body, especially the liver. The majority of cholesterol in plasma is carried on apolipoprotein B-contaimng lipoproteins, such as low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)   The risk of coronary artery disease in man increases when LDL and VLDL levels increase. Conversely, high levels of cholesterol carried in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) is protective against coronary artery disease (Am. J. Med., 1977;62:707-714).<br>
The statins represent perhaps the most important classlpf lipid-lowering drugs. These compounds inhibit HMG-CoA reductase which is implicated in the rate-limiting step in cellular cholesterol biosynthesis. Representative statins include atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The effectiveness of these compounds depends on LDL receptor regulation. Other important antilipidemia drugs include fibrates such as gemfibril and clofibratc, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine and colestipol, probucol, and nicotinic acid analogs.<br>
To date, a number of oral antidiabetic agents have been developed. The most commonly used hypoglygemic drugs are the sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas are generally used to stimulate insulin. The biguanide metformin is generally used to improve insulin sensitivity and to decrease hepatic glucose output. Acarbose is used to limit postprandial hyperglycemia Thiazolidine 2,4 diones ate used to enhance insulin action without increasing insulin secretion.<br>
Obesity is a chronic disease that is highly prevalent in modern society and is associated not only with a social stigma, but also with decreased life span and numerous medical problems, including diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, thromboembolic disease, and coronary heart disease. Rissanen et al, British Medical Journal, 301:835-837 (1990).   Treatment of obesity remains a problem and it is unclear whether dieting results in decreased long-term risk of early death. A further important obesity intervention is physical activity. Exercise, however, in general, has been found to be only moderately successful in promoting weight loss. A program combining both dieting and exercise as well as behaviour modification is widely viewed as the optimal approach to weight loss. Studies have demonstrated that the combination of both food restriction and exercise promote a substantial loss of fat while maitaining lean tissue.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activation Receptors (PPAR) are implicated in a number of biological processes and disease states including hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors that includes steroid, thyroid, and vitamin D receptors. They play a role in controlling expression of proteins that regulate lipid metabolism. Furthermore, the PPARs are activated by fatty acids and fatty acid metabolites. There are three PPAR subtypes PPAR α, PPAR ß (also referred to as PPAR δ), and PPAR . Each receptor shows a different pattern of tissue expression, and differences in activation by structurally diverse compounds. PPAR., for instance, is expressed most abundantly in adipose tissue and at lower levels in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, intestine, kidney, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells jas well as macrophages. PPAR receptors are associated with regulation of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels, macrophage differentiation, inflammatory response, and cell differentiation. Accordingly, PPARs have been associated with obesity, diabetes, carcinogenesis, hyperplasia, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia.<br>
In addition, PPARα agonists lower plasma triglycerides and LDL cholesterol and are therefore useful in treating hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia and obesity. PPAR y is associated with the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia and certain malignancies. FinalJy, activation of PPAR ß has been demonstrated to increase HDL levels. (Leibowitz, W097/28149, Aug. 1997.) More recently, ja PPARß" selective agonist was reported to have shown a dose-related increase in sjerum HDL-C and decrease in LDL-C and VLDL-TG in insulin-resistant middle aged rhesus monkeys. (W. R. Oliver et a]., PNAS, v. 98, pp. 5306-5311, 2001)<br>
Antilipidemic, antidiabetic and anti-obesity agents are still considered to have non-uniform effectiveness. The effectivieness of antidiabetic and antilipidemic therapies is limited, in part because of poor patient compliance due to unacceptable<br>
side effects. These side effects include diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort, and in the case of antidiabetics, edema, hypoglycemia and hepatoxicity. Furthermore, each type of drug does not work equally well in all patients.<br>
For the reasons set forth above, there is a need for novel antilipidemic, antidiabetic, and anti-obesity agents that can be used alone or in combination. Furthermore, activation of multiple PPARs, for instance, PPARß alone or in combination with the simultaneous activation of PPAR a and/or PPAR, may be desirable in formulating a treatment for dyshpidemia in which HDL is increased and LDL lowered.<br>

A.        Selectivity Measurements<br>
1.	Test A. Transient transfections assay using the HepG2 hepatoma cell line.<br>
HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmids encoding hPPARa, hPPARß or mPPAR chimeric receptors and a reporter containing the yeast upstream activating sequence (UAS) upstream of the viral E1B promoter controlling a luciferase reporter gene. In addition, the plasmid pRSVß-gal was used to control for transfection efficiency. HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS and lµM non-essential amino acid. On the first day, cells were split into 100mm dishes at 2.5x10 /dish and incubated overnight at 37C°/5% CO2 On the second day the cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA encoding a chimeric receptor, the luciferase reporter gene; and ß-gal. For each 100 mm dish, 15µg of lucifease reporter (PG5Elb) DNA, 15µg of Gal4-PPAR chimeric receptor DNA, and 1.5µg of ß-gal plasmid DNA were mixed with 1.4ml of opti-MEM in the tube. 28µl of LipoFectamine-2000 reagent was added to 1.4ml of opti-MEM in the tube, and incubate for 5 irnn.at RT. The diluted Lipofectamine-2000<br>
reagent was combined with the DNA mixture, and incubate for 20 min at RT. After fresh medium was added to eachlOOmm dish of cells, 2.8ml of Lipofectamine2000-DNA mixture was added dropwise to the ]00mm dish containing 14ml of medium, and incubate 37°C overnight. On day three cells were trypsinized off thelOO mm dishes and re-plated on 96 well plates. Cells were plated at 2.5x'l04 cells per well in 150u.l of media and 50|il of compound diluted by media was added. The test compound added were in the range from 50fiM to 50pM. After addition of compounds, the plates were incubated at 37C° for 24 hours. Subsequently cells were washed with once with 100)11 of PBS, lysed, and processed for measuring luciferase and P-gal activity using Dual-Light luciferase kit from Tropix ®, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, on an EG&amp;G Bethold MicroLumat LB96P luminometer. EC50 values were obtained using the GraphPad Prism™ program. Surprisingly, the compounds of the present invention exhibit activity for both PPARa and PPARP- Compounds of the present invention exhibited a range of Hep G2-hBeta EC50's ("EC50P") and Hep G2-hAlpha EC50's ("EC50a") from greater than zero to about 20uM. Specifically, as shown in Table 1, the Hep G2-hBeta EC50's and Hep G2-hAlpha ECso's for the compounds of the present invention fall within the following 6 groups:<br>

B.        Effect of PPAR modulators on lipid and human apoprotein Al concentrations in the hApoAl transgenic mouse<br>
Mice, transgenic for human apoAl, were purchased from Jackson laboratories. AH animals were allowed normal chow (Ralstoh-Purina) and water ad libitum in temperature controlled rooms, under a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle beginning with lights on at 6 AM.   During the treatment phase of the study the mice were dosed daily between 6 and 9 AM by oral gavage using a suspension vehicle of 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose plus 0.2 percent Tween-20 (CMC/Tween) containing the specified compounds. Control animals received vehicle alone. Vehicle volume represented 0.25 percent of body weight. Under anesthesia, tail blood was obtained weekly in the morning at the indicated days of study. At termination, tissue samples (liver, intestine, fat, and muscle) were taken to study effects on genes effecting lipid metabolism. Each of the compounds of the present invention that were tested effected a significant increase in HDL over the values observed for the control animals. Furthermore, these compounds resulted in triglyceride levels which were lower than observed in controls. Compounds of the present invention tested in the hApoAl transgenic mouse model showed a range of HDL-c elevation and triglyceride lowering when dosed at 30 mg/kg/day. For instance, Example 4 raised HDL-c 97% and lowered triglycerides 65 % relative to the control population,<br>
Example 6 raised HDL-c 24% and lowered tnglycendes 59 % relative to the control population, and Example 3 raised HDL-c 9% and lowered tnglycendes 70% relative to the control population.<br>
C. Effect of Compounds of the Invention on Insulin Resistant or Diabetic Cynomolgus Monkeys<br>
Cynomolgus monkeys that were either insulin resistant or diabetic (type II) were treated for eight weeks with [5-Methoxy-2-rnethy]-4-(4'-trifluoromethyl-biphenyl-4-ylmetbylsulfanyl)-pheno\y]-aceuc acid in arising dose fashion (0.1 to 1 mg/kg). Plasma was sampled bi-weekly and analyzed for glycemics and leptin. Body weight was also measured at various time points across the study. The diabetic monkey mean body weight data is presented in Table 2 and the insulin resistant monkey mean body weight data is presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 2 Diabetic Monkey Mean Body Weight<br>
(Table Removed)   <br>
Table 3 Insulin Resistant Monkey Mean Body Weight<br>
(Table Removed)   <br>
Plasma leptin values, presented as baseline values vs. 8-week treatment, were determined by ELISA and are presented in Table 4. The effect of [5-Methoxy-2-methyl-4-(4'-trifluoromethyl-biphenyl-4-ylmethy]sulfanyl)-phenoxy]-acetic acid on plasma leptin values in.diabetic and insulin.resistant obese cynomolgus monkeys is demonstrated by the lesser increase in plasma leptin values seen in the treated animals.<br>
The amount of exogenous insulin the diabetic monkeys received to maintain proper glucose levels, the exogenous insulin requirement, is also presented in Table 4 as baseline values vs. 8-week treatment.   By definition, insulin resistant monkeys are not yet diabetic and do not receive exogenous insulin. A reduction in exogenous insulin requirements is a measure of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control.<br>
