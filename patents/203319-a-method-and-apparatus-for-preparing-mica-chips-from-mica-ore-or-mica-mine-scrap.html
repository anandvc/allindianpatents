In the drawings<br>
Washing cum centrifuging unit (10) A. 1lustrates<br>
a thin hollow cylinder (11^tapered at both sides for the easy access of the mica chips. The periphery of one end of said hollow cylinder is covered with a mesh of predetermined size for allowing the washing off the mud and other impurities from mica ore. A mobile water tank 
7 -<br><br>
tank is with a housing (15)so as to prevent the<br>
spillage of water when said cylinder is dipped into the water tank - There is a water reservoir (16) from which the water is supplied to the mobile water tank (12). After the mica ores are washed inyo^teter and centrifuged to remove the excess water, it is dried with hot air at about 200 C and is discharged into a mobile<br>
hopper  
o 200  C is blown to dry the washed and centrifuged mica ore.<br>
The washing-cum centrifuging unit (10) is located adjacent to a splitter-disintegrator (20) which is provided with a hopper at its upper end thereof through which the dried mica ore is fed into the said splitter-disintegrated (20), said splitter disintegrator (20).<br>
The splitter (20) is to disintegrate the mica ore/mica mine scrap Delete into chips of different sizes. The splitter/disintegrator is run by an electric motor and has arrangement for variable speed drive with the help of changing of pulley size, to achieve different speed for disintegrating different size materials. The material is fed from the side of the splitter. A wire net is provided at the bottom of the splitter i.e. at the discharge opening. The wire nets are of different mesh sizes and are interchangeable. This is to control the size of the end product to the required range. The splitters/hammers are of different sizes and shapes for splitting   and  disintegration to the required size.<br>
- a -<br><br>
The said splitter-disintegrator (20) is provided with asquare body made of steal with a casing of cast iron.<br>
At the bottom of the splitter-disintegrator (20) i.e. at its discharge point a thin removal box is tkd which allows removal of flaky and thin material. The box allows the material to free fall at a distance of 1200 mm and with the help of blower while the material is falling, the flaky and thin particles arc moved from the material and with the! help of ducting, is sent to the cyclone where the thin and flaky pieces, hut heavier falls through this cyclone and are collected in a bad under it.   The air together with dust with<br>
the help of ducting is further sent to a dust collector unit (26) fitted bags to<br>
A arrest the dust particles; which arc collected in the bags, and with the help of<br>
filter bags the fresh air Is released in the atmosphere.   The system is run by an electric motor.<br>
The splitter is provided with a central rotor (not shown) having a series of hammers to split the mica ore into chips. The said hammer comprises three plates as shown in Figure 3 of (he drawings (40,42,45), said three plates are joined together aud bolted (47) to form one single piece hammer.<br>
The rotor is rotated by means of a motor (not shown) with an arrangement to variable sped drive. The discharge end of the splitter is provided with an interchangeable wire net depending on the size of the discharge material required.<br>
_9_<br><br>
The splitter hammers generally comprises a set of four. The said hammersr , range in size from 12 mm to 60 mm in width and 80 mm to 200 in.length- The-splitter hammers are corrugated and the edges are sharpened for splitting the material effectively. The splitters  are normally of three peices and are bolted  together.<br>
The centre peices of hammers are straight and he other two pieces<br>
o located at the side are bent outside at an angle between  14-49 .<br>
Generally such sets are used at a time and also partly for achieving the desired results.<br>
The splitted mica chips are separated by suction to remove the dust therefrom and the heavier particles are taken out through an outlet (24) and collected 4n a collector (26). The mica chips are then lifted from the collector (26) by a bucket elevator (30) and discharged through a thin discharge box (32) .<br>
The bucket elevator (30) is required to carry the material from splitter-disintegrator (20) to a certain height ,so that it feeds the material to rotary screen. The bucket elevator is run through buckets, belts, dr.ive pulley, boot pulley, screw take up, motor, gear box, coupling ,etc. Pltform is required for maintaining the bucket elevator components at different fllor heights.<br>
Here again the dust particles are removed through suction  before feeding the bigger sized particles through a rotary screen (40<br>

speed variation. This speed variation could be between 1 ft - 10 ft per minute. This speed variation is achieved with the help of different sizes of pulleys attached with the main motor drive through reduction gearbox. All conveyors are driven by a common line shaft so as to maintain the same speed of all the conveyors. The belt is preferably made out of 2 ply polyester of white colour. The white colour is used for the purpose to give a contrast effect against the material and impurities for the purpose of manual picking of impurities from the material and to reduce the risk of impurities going with the main product and also to increase the production efficiency. The width of belt is 1000 mm so that the spread of material takes place properly in the whole width of the belt to avoid overlapping of materials at the time of manual picking.<br>
The purpose of the hopper and vibrating tray is to store and discharge material to conveyor at a constant and regulated speed. The vibrating tray has a 2 way discharge run by a electromagnetic electromechanical vibrator and supported on si ings from hopper. With the help of these vibrators the flow of material on to conveyor is controlled. The tray is designed in such a way so as to spread the material in whole of the width of the conveyor belt- The speed of the belt could vary from 1 ft per minute to 10 ft per minute.<br>
