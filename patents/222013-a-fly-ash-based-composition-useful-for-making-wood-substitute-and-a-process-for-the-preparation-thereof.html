				<td>The present invention relates to a fly ash based composition useful for making wood substitute.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a novel composition comprising of fly ash, natural fibre and polyurethane resin for making wood substitute therefrom.<br>
All over the world, thermal power plants produce large amount of fly ash .It is necessary to convert this waste in to a valuable product .A novel composition comprising of fly ash, fibre and polyurethane resin has been prepared, which can be used for making door shutters as wood substitute, partitions corrugated roofing and for insulation applications.<br>
Fly ash creates pollution in and around the dumping sites. Several researches have been done to utilise this waste as filler in cements and for making bricks. The reference can be made to U.S. Patents 5,047,145, 5,227,047 and 6,027,551 by Institute of Materials Processing at Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan wherein a mineral called Basanite (CaSO4) is removed from the surface of the fly ash. Basanite is a gypsum-like material that has a retarding effect on cement in concrete mixtures. Froth flotation process is used to remove carbon and enhance the fly ash.<br>
The removal via wet processing improves early set and strength in concrete. This process produces a consistent enhanced pozzolan product. Carbon content of 1.0% or less has no effect on entrained air in concrete.<br>
The reference can be made to patent application No.Hl 1-51745 wherein a method for producing composition by using coal ash, and heavy weight aggregate as remedy for its weight deficiency, yielding a hardened material, which can substitute for all kinds of concrete blocks is proposed.<br>
Vibration acceleration of 3G or greater is used for compacting to produce the solid.<br>
Reference may be made to September 3, 1998 announcement of First Energy Corporation (NYSE:FE), Crown Coal &amp; Coke Company and Canyon Resources, Inc. ,wherein the formation of Carbon Plus. Carbon Plus process separates coal from fly ash, creating high grade carbon and low carbon fly ash, products are utilized in the steel, foundry and cement industries. Reference may be made to Toyaki Miyagawa, Susumu Inoue's paper in Cement and Concrete Composites (2000) 22,1pp. v-v. wherein the attempts have been done of mixing fly ash with concrete.<br>
Reference may be made to the paper by Zouheir A. Hashem, Robert L. Yuan, Construction and Building Materials 2001,15,8, pp. 369-378 wherein short vs. long column behavior of pultruded glass-fiber reinforced polymer composites has been reported for construction,<br>
The drawbacks are that the above patents and papers are related to use of fly ash mixed concrete and cement in construction .Similarly pultruded glass-fiber reinforced polymer composites are used in construction. No report is available on the composition comprising of fly ash, fibre and polyurethane resin composition for application in wood substitution or in insulation, which needs desired density comparable to wood or insulation panel.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel composition comprising of the fly ash, fibre and polyurethane resin for making wood substitute there from, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for making a new type of wood substitute composition for insulation, which needs desired density comparable to wood or insulation panel.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a fly ash based composition useful for making wood substitute comprising fibre in the range of 0.5-5% by wt., fly ash in the range of 20-65 wt. %, thermosetting resin in the range of 30-40% by wt., diluents in the range of 5-50 wt %, additive in the range of 0-0.5wt % and the said composition has the following characteristics:<br>
compression strength is in the range of 19-120 kg/cm2, density is in the range of 0.7-0.8 g/cm3 and colour of the composition is grey.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the thermosetting resin used is of commercial grade room temperature fomable two component polyurethane resin system.<br>
In yet another embodiment the commercially available two component polyurethane resin is having foaming density ranging from 12 pcf to 50 pcf.<br>
In yet another embodiment the additive used is Ti02 or any other fibre retardant in less than 0.5 wt %.<br>
In yet another embodiment the fibre used is selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
Jute, Sun hemp, Minwool fibre, Polyester, Nylon and Sisal having length ranging from 15µm to 5 mm.<br>
In yet another embodiment the diluent used is selected from the group consisting of ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and acetone.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of a composition useful for making wood substitute which comprises drying fly ash and fibers, at a temperature in the range of 50-80°C, for a period of 45-60 minutes, mixing the above said dried fiber in the range of 0.5-5% by wt, dried fly ash in the range of 20-65 wt. %, additive 0-0.5wt %, polyurethane resin 30-40% by wt., diluents 5-50 wt % and pouring the above said ingredients mixture to a desired shaped mould, followed by curing, at a temperature in the range of 70-90°C, for a period of 3-10 hrs to make the desired component.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the heat treatment to ingredients mixture for curing with mould is done preferably at a temperature in the range of 60-80°C.<br>
