According to this invention, the kerosene burner is described herein comprising a kerosene fuel inlet nozzle, continuous looped metal tube, bent with 2 loops at least, combustion gas outlet nozzle holder, combustion gas out let nipple, a top flame spreader, flame ring and burner ring.<br>
The improved and modified kerosene burner's fuel inlet nozzle at least 5 milli meter diameter hole at bottom side and two holes at least 3 milli meter diameter at top, having the external tiireads(at bottom) with nut as single part. The said inlet nozzle is braced to the two ends of continuous looped tube, which is bent to form at least with 2 loops. The said continuous tube diameter is at least 3 milli meters. A combustion gas outlet nozzle holder is braced in upward direction at the bottom of centre looped pipe, which is having the internal threads, in which the combustion gas outlet nipple is fitted by<br><br>
screw fitment. The flame spreader is a sheet metal piece in curved shape, pressed to form as braced on the top of burner to reduce the obstructions to the combustion gas path and to guide the hot flames. A burner ring is braced at externally, center of the metallic pipe loops to position the metallic flame ring characterised by the comprises of single continuous loop shaped bend metallic tube (1). This metaiiic flame ring may be made in ceramic, metal, so that it will not absorb or dissipate heat and loss of heat can be avoided. This aspect increases the effective heat transfer.<br>
In order to more clearly, the said inlet nozzle purpose is to fit the burner in the stove with its threads and nut support. The purpose of the said continuous tube Is to supply the kerosene and convert the kerosene into gas form by the heat of the burner flames. The converted kerosene gas will come out from the nozzle. The purpose of the said flame spreader, which is on the top is to spread the flame equally around the bent loops and also to transfer the flame heat to the pressurised kerosene fuel, which is in the bent loop shaped pipe. The purpose of the burner ring is to hold the flame ring. The purpose of the said flame ring is to distribute the flame in circle shape equally In upward direction, around the metallic pipe bent loops top portion and to guide the flames for transferring the flame's heat covering loops.<br>
The working procedure of the improved and modified burner is as follows.<br>
The kerosene burner is ignited as usually like existing bumers igniting methods. The kerosene stove is to be fitted with this bumer and filled the kerosene, pressurise the kerosene stove container until the fuel come out from the nozzle( 4 ) of the burner. This kerosene is to be ignited with the extemal flames. After few minutes the bent looped pipe( 1 ) will be heated up and also the kerosene, which is in the bent looped pipe( 1 ) also heated up. Due to these phenomena the kerosene converts in to gas form and come out through the nozzie( 4 ) of the burner due to increase in pressure in the bent looped pipe(l). These kerosene fumes will be ignited by the extemal flames and the burner get ignited on Its own without external flames. After bumer ignited independently, the kerosene stored container of the stove should be pressurised by the air pump as required or up to the maximum. With this air pressure of the stove, the kerosene will come out from the stove tank and entered in to the improved &amp; modified burner through its inlet nozzle( 2 ). The pressurised kerosene, which Is passing through the bent looped pipes(l), is heated up by the burner's flames heat and also through the flame spreader(5). The said flame spreader( 5 ) is heated up by the burner's  flames.   Due  to  this  phenomenon,   the  pressurised  fuel<br><br>
convert Into gas form and exit through the nozzle(4), which is at bottom of the second bent ioop(l) in upward direction.<br>
Advantages of this modified &amp; improved burner as foilows:<br>
1.	The Utilisation of the calorific value of kerosene, as the<br>
combustion gas path is uniform passage from the inlet to<br>
nipple is incorporated with more volume of space in the bend<br>
looped pipe for expansion of gases due to super heating.<br>
2.	This burner is incorporated to eliminate the existing problems<br>
such as, trouble, explosion can be eliminated.<br>
3.	These type of burners are incorporated to increase the efficiency of the fuel and also the fuel consumption is very less.<br>
4.	These type of burners are incorporated in reducing the carbon.<br>
5.	The manufacturing cost is very less.<br>
6.	This burner Is Incorporated in reducing of bracing points, that are only two for the kerosene(or fuel) pipe line and one at nozzle holder.<br>
7.	This burner is incorporated by the single tube in two loops at least by bending as required. Due to this the more volume and same cross section throught the pipe enables the generation of kerosene combustion gas more due to super heating efficiently.<br><br>
8.	The super heating results in pressure and more volume of gas, unless until the combustion gas produced Is spent by burning the burner does not draw kerosene from the fuel tank. Thus this burner consumes lesser kerosene than any other existing ones.<br>
9.	This burner is having only 3 braced joints In the fuel lead pipe, two bracing joints at bottom of Inlet and one at nozzle fitments.<br>
10.	This burner is Incorporated in reducing the number of<br>
bracing joints in the gas path at the hottest region at the top<br>
of burner is eliminated by introducing the single looped pipe<br>
to avoid restriction to the fuel and provide safety to the user.<br><br>
11.	The burner will   produce less roaring sound while burning<br>
due to turbulence because of uniform path of combustion gas.<br>
12.	The burner is incorporated in carbon free combustion,<br>
13.	The life of the burner is longer life than the existing burners.<br>
14.	This burner can be used in industrial heating applications.<br>
15.	This burner principle can be used or can be incorporated for any fuel to convert into heat energy form.<br>
