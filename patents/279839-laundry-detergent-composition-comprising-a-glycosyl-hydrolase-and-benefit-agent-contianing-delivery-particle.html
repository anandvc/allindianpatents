				<td>LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING A GLYCOSYL HYDROLASE AND A BENEFIT AGENT CONTAINING DELIVERY PARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION The present application relates to a laundry detergent composition comprising a glycosyl hydrolase and a benefit agent containing delivery particle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benefit agents, such as perfumes, silicones, waxes, vitamins and fabric softening agents, are expensive and generally less effective when employed at high levels in fabric care compositions. As a result, there is a desire to maximize the effectiveness of such benefit agents. One method of achieving such objective is to improve the delivery efficiencies of such benefit agents. Unfortunately, it is difficult to improve the delivery efficiencies of benefit agents as such agents may be lost do to the agents' physical or chemical characteristics, or such agents may be incompatible with other compositional components or the situs that is treated.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a composition that provides improved benefit agent delivery efficiency.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition comprising a glycosyl hydrolase and a benefit agent containing delivery particles comprising a core material and a wall material that at least partially surrounds the core material. Without wishing to be bound by theory the Inventors believe that the action of certain glycosyl hydrolase on the fabric surface opens up the pore structure of the cotton fibres so as to increase the entrapment of the benefit agent containing particles in the fabric. In addition, the action of these certain glycosyl hydrolases increases the surface area of the fabric, further improving the performance of the benefit agent during the laundering process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glycosyl hydrolase<br>
The glycosyl hydrolase has enzymatic activity towards both xyloglucan and amorphous cellulose substrates, wherein the glycosyl hydrolase is selected from GH families 5, 12, 44 or 74.<br>
The enzymatic activity towards xyloglucan substrates is described in more detail below. The enzymatic activity towards amorphous cellulose substrates is described in more detail below.<br>
The glycosyl hydrolase enzyme preferably belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 44. The glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family definition is described in more detail in Biochem J. 1991, v280, 309-316.<br>
The glycosyl hydrolase enzyme preferably has a sequence at least 70%, or at least 75% or at least 80%, or at least 85%, or at least 90%, or at least 95% identical to sequence ED No. 1.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends in Genetics 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled "longest identity" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows: (Identical Residues x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment).<br>
Suitable glycosyl hydrolases are selected from the group consisting of: GH family 44 glycosyl hydrolases from Paenibacillus polyxyma (wild-type) such as XYG1006 described in WO 01/062903 or are variants thereof; GH family 12 glycosyl hydrolases from Bacillus licheniformis (wild-type) such as Seq. No. ID: 1 described in WO 99/02663 or are variants thereof; GH family 5 glycosyl hydrolases from Bacillus agaradhaerens (wild type) or variants thereof; GH family 5 glycosyl hydrolases from Paenibacillus (wild type) such as XYG1034 and XYG 1022described in WO 01/064853 or variants thereof; GH family 74 glycosyl hydrolases from Jonesia sp. (wild type) such as XYG 1020 described in WO 2002/077242 or variants thereof; and GH family 74 glycosyl hydrolases from Trichoderma Reesei (wild type), such as the enzyme described in more detail in Sequence ID no. 2 of WO03/089598, or variants thereof.<br>
Preferred glycosyl hydrolases are selected from the group consisting of: GH family 44 glycosyl hydrolases from Paenibacillus polyxyma (wild-type) such as XYG1006 or are variants thereof.<br>
Enzymatic activity towards xyloglucan substrates<br>
An enzyme is deemed to have activity towards xyloglucan if the pure enzyme has a specific activity of greater than 50000 XyloU/g according to the following assay at pH 7.5.<br>
The xyloglucanase activity is measured using AZCL-xyloglucan from Megazyme, Ireland as substrate (blue substrate).<br>
A solution of 0.2% of the blue substrate is suspended in a 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 20°C under stirring in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (0.75ml to each), 50 microlitres enzyme solution is added and they are incubated in an Eppendorf Thermomixer for 20 minutes at 40°C, with a mixing of 1200 rpm. After incubation the coloured solution is separated from the solid by 4 minutes centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and the absorbance of the supernatant is measured at 600nm in a 1cm cuvette using a spectrophotometer. One XyloU unit is defined as the amount of enzyme resulting in an absorbance of 0.24 in a 1cm cuvette at 600nm.<br>
Only absorbance values between 0.1 and 0.8 are used to calculate the XyloU activity. If an absorbance value is measured outside this range, optimization of the starting enzyme concentration should be carried out accordingly.<br>
Enzymatic activity towards amorphous cellulose substrates<br>
An enzyme is deemed to have activity towards amorphous cellulose if the pure enzyme has a specific activity of greater than 20000 EBG/g according to the following assay at pH 7.5. Chemicals used as buffers and substrates were commercial products of at least reagent grade.<br>
Endoglucanase Activity Assay Materials:<br>
0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5<br>
Cellazyme C tablets, supplied by Megazyme International, Ireland.<br>
Glass microfiber filters, GF/C, 9cm diameter, supplied by Whatman.<br>
Method:<br>
In test tubes, mix 1ml pH 7,5 buffer and 5ml deionised water.<br>
Add 100 microliter of the enzyme sample (or of dilutions of the enzyme sample with known<br>
weighf.weight dilution factor). Add 1 Cellazyme C tablet into each tube, cap the tubes and mix<br>
on a vortex mixer for 10 seconds. Place the tubes in a thermostated water bath, temperature 40°C.<br>
After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes, and replace in<br>
the water bath. After 60 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inversion and then filter<br>
through a GF/C filter. Collect the filtrate in a clean tube.<br>
Measure Absorbance (Aenz) at 590nm, with a spectrophotometer. A blank value, Awater, is<br>
determined by adding 100µl water instead of 100 microliter enzyme dilution.<br>
Calculate Adelta = Aenz - Awater.<br>
Adelta must be 
Determine DFO.l, where DFO.l is the dilution factor needed to give Adelta = 0.1 .<br>
Unit Definition: 1 Endo-Beta-Glucanase activity unit (1 EBG) is the amount of enzyme mat gives Adelta = 0.10, under the assay conditions specified above. Thus, for example, if a given enzyme sample, after dilution by a dilution factor of 100, gives Adelta= 0.10, then the enzyme sample has an activity of 100 EBG/g.<br>
