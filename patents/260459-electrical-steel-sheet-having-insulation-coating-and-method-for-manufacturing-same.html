				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ELECTRICAL STEEL SHEET HAVING INSULATION COATING AND METHOD FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an electrical steel sheet<br>
having an insulation coating, and specifically relates to an<br>
electrical steel sheet having an insulation coating which does<br>
not contain chromium, being used mainly in motors and<br>
transformers, friendly to environment, free from toxic<br>
substances such as hexavalent chromium in the coating and also<br>
in the coating liquid for forming the coating.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Insulation coating on an electrical steel sheet used for<br>
motors, transformers, and the like is requested to have not only<br>
interlaminar resistance but also varieties of characteristics<br>
such as convenience during working and forming and stability<br>
during storage and use. Furthermore, since electrical steel<br>
sheets are used in varieties of applications, there are developed<br>
various kinds of insulation coating responding to each<br>
application.<br>
For example, when an electrical steel sheet is treated by<br>
punching, shearing, bending, and the like, the residual strain<br>
deteriorates the magnetic characteristics. To recover the<br>
deteriorated magnetic characteristics, stress relieving<br><br>
annealing is often applied to thus treated electrical steel sheet<br>
at an approximate temperature range from 750°C to 850°C. On<br>
applying the stress relieving annealing, the insulation coating<br>
has to endure the annealing treatment.<br>
The insulation coating is roughly grouped into three kinds :<br>
(a) inorganic coating which emphasizes weldability and heat<br>
resistance, and endures the stress relieving annealing,<br>
(excluding organic resin, in principle); (b) semi-organic<br>
coating comprising an inorganic compound as the basis and<br>
containing an organic resin, which aims to have both punchability<br>
and weldability, and endures the stress relieving annealing; and<br>
(c) organic coating for special applications, which cannot be<br>
treated by stress relieving annealing. As of these, the ones<br>
for general use, which endure the stress relieving annealing,<br>
are (a) and (b) which are the coatings containing inorganic matter,<br>
both of which contain chromium compound in the coating.<br>
Particularly, the chromate-based insulation coating of (b) type,<br>
containing organic resin, is widely used owing to the<br>
considerable improvement of punchability compared with the<br>
inorganic-based insulation coating.<br>
For example, Examined Japanese Patent Publication No.<br>
60-36476 describes an electrical steel sheet having an electrical<br>
insulation coating, which is manufactured by applying a coating<br>
liquid on the surface of a steel sheet, followed by baking by<br>
a known method, which coating liquid is prepared by mixing a<br><br>
bichromate-based aqueous solution containing at least one kind<br>
of bivalent metal with 5 to 120 parts by weight of solid content<br>
of a resin emulsion (vinyl acetate and VeoVa (TM) at a ratio<br>
ranging from 90/10 to 40/60), and 10 to 60 parts by weight of<br>
an organic reducing agent, to 100 parts by weight of CrC&gt;3 in the<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
Most of that type of chromate-based coatings for electric<br>
steel sheet contains trivalent chromium as the steel sheet<br>
products, iraising no toxicity problem. Since, however, toxic<br>
hexavalent chromium has to be used in the stage of coating liquid<br>
(coating liquid applied on the steel sheet to form an insulation<br>
coating), there is required to observe strict handling<br>
regulations as well as establishing satisfactory apparatus to<br>
secure good workplace environment.<br>
Under the present state and responding to the recent<br>
increasing concern about the environment, also the field of<br>
electrical steel sheet faces the request of customers to supply<br>
products having insulation coating free from chromium.<br>
As the technology using a main component other than chromic<br>
acid, many kinds of semi-organic insulation coatings containing<br>
inorganic colloid such as silica as the main component are<br>
disclosed. Owing to unnecessariness of handling toxic<br>
hexavalent chromium solution, those semi-organic insulation<br>
coatings containing inorganic colloid as the main component are<br>
highly advantageously used in view of environment. For instance,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-34812 discloses a method to<br><br>
improve the corrosion resistance of inorganic-colloid-based<br>
coating by regulating the quantity of C1 and S in the resin/silica<br>
coating to a specified level or below. The method improves the<br>
corrosion resistance of the product sheet in a humidity cabinet<br>
test environment. However, the corrosion resistance thereof<br>
under severe conditions such as salt spray cannot reach the level<br>
of the corrosion resistance of the case applying Cr-containing<br>
insulation coating. Furthermore, with the addition of silica,<br>
punchability also cannot reach the good level of the case applying<br>
Cr-containing insulation coating, as in the case of corrosion<br>
resistance.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]<br>
The electrical steel sheet is required to have wet<br>
corrosion resistance and salt spray corrosion resistance, each<br>
under normal temperature environment, and corrosion resistance<br>
after high temperature treatment (stress relieving annealing)<br>
at 700°C or above. Different from surface-treated steel sheet<br>
with plating of zinc, tin, or the like in order to have sacrifice<br>
corrosion prevention in a corrosive environment, the electrical<br>
steel sheet exposes the steel portion to atmosphere. In this<br>
case, it is important to suppress the cathodic corrosion by<br>
providing high grade barrier property as a coating characteristic,<br>
thus by rejecting water, oxygen, chlorine, and the like becoming<br>
the cause element of corrosion. To provide that high barrier<br>
characteristic, it is preferred to have continuous and dense<br><br>
structure such as that of inorganic coating.<br>
On the other hand, to obtain good punchability, or to<br>
suppress wear of mold after successive punching cycles, which<br>
wear is drawback in punching, the addition of lubricant component<br>
to the coating is effective. However, when the coating is a mixed<br>
coating of inorganic and organic resins to establish both the<br>
corrosion resistance and the workability, the continuity of<br>
coating deteriorates, and the corrosion resistance deteriorates .<br>
Responding to the above conditions, an object of the<br>
present invention is to provide an electrical steel sheet having<br>
an insulation coating which has performance equivalent to or<br>
higher than that of Cr-containing insulation coating even as an<br>
insulation coating containing an inorganic matter free from Cr<br>
as the main component, giving excellent corrosion resistance and<br>
punchability.<br>
[MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM]<br>
To solve the above problem, the inventors of the present<br>
invention conducted detail study and derived the following<br>
findings.<br>
The corrosion resistance of product sheets with<br>
silica-based chromate-free coating cannot fully be improved even<br>
by the currently proposed' decreased amount of impurities such<br>
as C1- and SO42-, and the corrosion resistance thereof becomes<br>
nonuniform depending on the manufacturing conditions. To this<br>
point, the inventors of the present invention variously<br><br>
investigated the causes.<br>
The investigation of the inventors of the present invention<br>
confirmed that many cases of deteriorating the corrosion<br>
resistance are accompanied with cracks in the coating. That is,<br>
since colloidal silica does not allow the silica to form a<br>
three-dimensional network (three-dimensional structure) at a<br>
baking temperature ranging from about 200°C to about 300°C, thus -<br>
the silica itself has no film-formability, which is presumably<br>
the cause of crack generation in the coating and of nonuniformily<br>
of corrosion resistance depending on the manufacturing<br>
conditions.<br>
From the above findings, it was found that the formation<br>
of three-dimensional network of -Si-O-Si-, or three-dimensional<br>
cross-linking, is important to form a coating having good<br>
corrosion resistance, and that the problem is solved by a mean<br>
of forming the above three-dimensional network by polymerizing<br>
the polysiloxane with an organic resin (a polymer containing<br>
carbon element). Furthermore, when the polysiloxane polymer is<br>
three-dimensionally cross-linked using a cross-linking agent<br>
such as melamine, isocyanate, silane coupling agent, and<br>
oxadoline, it was found that an electrical steel sheet having<br>
an insulation coating having more excellent characteristics in<br>
relation to the corrosion resistance after stress relieving<br>
annealing is obtained. The embodiments are described below.<br>
(I) Forming composite material integrating inorganic<br>
component with organic component<br><br>
The inorganic component and the organic component (organic<br>
resin) are brought into composite (copolymerized) in the step<br>
of synthesizing the resin, instead of conventional technology<br>
in which the inorganic component and the organic component are<br>
simply mixed together in the coating liquid. That is,<br>
polysiloxane (inorganic component) and one or more of organic<br>
resins such as acrylic resin are copolymerized, thus obtaining<br>
the polysiloxane polymer. Since, in the polysiloxane polymer<br>
(inorganic composite resin), the silanol group (-SiOH) of<br>
polysiloxane and the hydroxyl group (-OH) of organic resin are<br>
dehydrated-condensed to form covalent bond, this is a composite<br>
having strongly bonding the inorganic component with the organic<br>
component. The polysiloxane polymer has hardness and barrier<br>
performance of inorganic properties, and flexibility and<br>
workability of organic properties.<br>
(II) Forming three-dimensional network<br>
(three-dimensional cross-linking)<br>
For further improving the barrier performance, the<br>
polysiloxane polymer is brought into three-dimensional<br>
cross-linking via a cross-linking agent. In concrete terms,<br>
cross-linking is conducted using one or more cross-linking agents<br>
selected from the group consisting of melamine, isocyanate,<br>
silane coupling agent, and oxadoline, which show reactivity with<br>
both the polar groups of hydroxyl group in the organic resin and<br>
silanol group in the polysiloxane portion.<br><br>
The present invention has been perfected on the basis of<br>
the above findings, and the essence of the present invention is<br>
the following.<br>
(1)	An electrical steel sheet having an insulation<br>
coating prepared by applying a coating liquid on the surface of<br>
an electrical steel sheet, followed by baking, which coating<br>

selected from the group consisting of acrylic resin, styrene<br>
resin, vinyl acetate resin, polyester resin, urethane resin,<br>
polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, polyamide resin,<br>

as the organic resin, and 1 to 50 parts by weigh of one or more<br>

isocyanate, silane coupling agent, and oxadoline, as the<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described in detail in the<br>
following.<br>
The electrical steel sheet according to the present<br>
invention is a steel sheet having an insulation coating. The<br>
insulation coating contains a composite resin (polysiloxane<br>
polymer) prepared by copolymerizing polysiloxane with an organic<br>
resin (polymer containing carbon element) in advance. The<br><br>
chemical composition is the most important requirement of the<br>
present invention. With that insulation coating, there are<br>
provided corrosion resistance (specifically corrosion<br>
resistance of annealed sheet) and punchability equivalent to or<br>
higher than those of the electrical steel sheet having a<br>
Cr-containing insulation coating.<br><electrical steel sheet><br>
The description begins with the electrical steel sheet<br>
applied in the present invention.<br>
The electrical steel sheet (also referred to "electrical<br>
iron sheet") before forming the coating, which can be used in<br>
the present invention, may be the one having any composition,<br>
not specifically limited, if only it is a steel sheet (iron sheet)<br>
which is adjusted to have at least the specific resistivity to<br>
obtain the desired magnetic characteristics (such as low iron<br>
loss) . Specifically preferred one is to apply to medium to high<br>
grade electrical steel sheets containing sole Si or (Si + Al)<br>
in a range from about 0.1 to about 10.0% by mass, and giving about<br>
W15/50 ≤5.0 W/kg.<br>
The surface of the electrical steel sheet on which the<br>
insulation coating is to be formed may be subjected to arbitrary<br>
preliminary treatment such as degreasing by alkali or the like,<br>
pickling by hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
and the like, intensifying, and magnetic domain refining, and<br>
may be as-manufactured surface (untreated).<br>
Although the forming of a third layer between the<br><br>
insulation coating and the steel sheet surface is not necessarily<br>
required, the third layer may be formed at need. For example,<br>
ordinary manufacturing method may form an oxide film of the metal<br>
of steel sheet between the insulation coating and the steel sheet<br>
surface. The step of removing the oxide film can be eliminated.<br>
Although a forsterite film may be formed depending on the<br>
manufacturing method, the step of removing the film can be<br>
eliminated.<br><insulation coating><br>
Next is the description about the insulation coating of<br>
the present, invention, applied on the surface of the above steel<br>
sheet.<br>
The insulation coating according to the present invention<br>
is obtained by applying a coating liquid containing polysiloxane<br>
and an organic resin, which are the essential components<br>
described below, on the surface of the electrical steel sheet,<br>
followed by baking. In the preparation step, a polysiloxane<br>
polymer prepared by copolymerizing the polysiloxane with the<br>
organic resin in advance is added to the coating liquid.<br>
• Polysiloxane<br>
Polysiloxane is a polymer which has -Si-O- (siloxane bond)<br>
in the main molecular chain. The polysiloxane is copolymerized<br>
with an organic resin in advance. The copolymerization provides<br>
covalent bond created by dehydration and condensation of silanol<br>
group (-SiOH) of the polysiloxane and hydroxyl group (-OH) or<br><br>
silanol group (-SiOH), (in the case that silanol group is<br>
introduced in the organic resin, in advance) , of the organic resin,<br>
thereby providing composite of strongly bonding the inorganic<br>
component with the organic component. That is, since the<br>
inorganic component and the organic component form a<br>
three-dimensional network in advance, there can be obtained<br>
homogeneous coating free from cracks, and can be formed a coating<br>
having good corrosion resistance.<br>
The blending ratio of polysiloxane to the total solid<br>
content in the insulation coating, (or the total coating amount<br>
after baking) , is preferably adjusted to a range of 10% by mass<br>
or more and 90% by mass or less as SiO2. If the blending ratio<br>
thereof is less than 10% by mass, the percentage of remained<br>
coating after the stress relieving annealing becomes small so<br>
that the removal property of stiction deteriorates in some cases.<br>
When the blending ratio of polysiloxane increases, the coating<br>
becomes strong. If, however, the blending ratio thereof exceeds<br>
90% by mass, the flexibility becomes insufficient, and the<br>
corrosion resistance may deteriorate depending on the<br>
manufacturing conditions. The blending ratio of polysiloxane<br>
to the total coating amount after the stress relieving annealing<br>
significantly increases owing to the decomposition of organic<br>
component, (50%), thus the blending ratio thereof after the<br>
stress relieving annealing is not required to stay within the<br>
above preferable range.<br>
On assessing the amount of polysiloxane, the term "as SiO2"<br><br>
(i.e. in terms of SiO2) means that the content of SiO2 is<br>
calculated on the assumption that all the contained Si<br>
forms SiO2. For example, when sole Si amount is<br>
measured, the amount is converted into the amount of<br>
"SiO2", and the ratio of the converted amount to the total<br>
coating is determined.<br>
Although the particle size of polysiloxane is not<br>
specifically limited, a preferable size range is larger<br>
than 0.3 μm and smaller than 0.5 μm. That is, small<br>
particle size deteriorates the stability of solution so<br>
that the size is preferably regulated to larger than 0.03<br>
μm in view of operability. Since smaller particle size<br>
is more preferred from the point of coating appearance,<br>
the size is preferably adjusted to smaller than 0.5 μm.<br>
The particle size is determined by observing particles<br>
under electron microscope or the like to measure the<br>
maximum diameter and the minimum diameter for individual<br>
particles, and by calculating the average of them.<br>
• Organic resin (polymer containing carbon element)<br>
Regarding the organic resin which is<br>
copolymerized with the above polysiloxane in the present<br>
invention, the following resins are applicable: acrylic<br>
resin, styrene resin, vinyl acetate resin, polyester<br>
resin, urethane resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene<br>
resin, polyamide resin, polycarbonate resin, phenol<br>
resin, alkyd resin, and epoxy resin. One or more<br>
resins selected from above-given resins are<br>
copolymerized with the polysiloxane. On forming a<br>
three-dimensional network by forming<br><br>
cross-links in the polysiloxane polymer, which is<br>
prepared by copolymerizing the polysiloxane with the<br>
organic resin, via -Si-O-C- bond or -Si-O-Si-C- bond,<br>
it is more preferable to have a functional group<br>
bondable to the side chain of the skeleton of organic<br>
resin<br>
The blending ratio of polymer having carbon<br>
element to the total solid content in the insulation<br>
coating is preferably regulated to 0.1 times or more<br>
the blending ratio of polysiloxane, (above given SiO2<br>
converted value)<br>
•	Polysiloxane polymer<br>
The degree of polymerization of the polysiloxane<br>
polymer is in an arbitrary range for applying without<br>
raising problem if only the degree provides the coating<br>
liquid.<br>
The particle size of polysiloxane polymer is<br>
preferably adjusted to larger than 0,. 04 μm and smaller<br>
than 0.6 μm. If the size is smaller than 0.04 μm, the<br>
stability of solution deteriorates. If the size is 0.6<br>
μm or larger, the coating becomes rough and the<br>
appearance deteriorates.<br>
•	Cross-linking agent<br>
According to the present invention, there is<br>
further added 1 to 50 parts by weight of cross-linking<br>
agent as the total of one or more of melamine ,<br>
isocyanate, silane coupling agent, and oxadoline to 100<br>
parts by weight of the polysiloxane polymer. Addition<br>
of cross-linking agent induces cross-linking between<br>
polysiloxane polymers, thus forming further dense<br>
coating to<br><br>
improve corrosion resistance, specifically the corrosion<br>
resistance after the stress relieving annealing. If the added<br>
amount of cross-linking agent as the total is less than 1 part<br>
by weight, the effect of cross-linking cannot be attained, and<br>
the corrosion resistance after the stress relieving annealing<br>
becomes insufficient. If the added amount thereof exceeds 50<br>
parts by weight, non-reacted cross-linking agent remains, which<br>
deteriorates the coating adhesion property and the hardness of<br>
coating.<br>
The above-described means provides the characteristics<br>
aimed in the present invention. Adding to the above components,<br>
the following-given additives and other inorganic compounds and<br>
organic compounds can be added to achieve the object described<br>
below within a range not to deteriorate the coating property and<br>
effect of the present invention. On adding the following-given<br>
additives and other inorganic compounds and organic compounds,<br>
addition of excess amount thereof deteriorates the coating<br>
performance so that it is preferable to adjust the total amount<br>
of additives and other inorganic compounds and organic compounds<br>
to about 75% by mass or less to the total coating amount of the<br>
insulation coating according to the present invention, and more<br>
preferably about 50% by mass or less.<br>
• Additive<br>
Applicable additive includes known surface-active agent,<br>
rust-preventive agent, lubricant, and defoaming agent. The<br><br>
adding amount of the additive is preferably adjusted to about<br>
30% by mass or less to the total solid content of the coating.<br>
• Other inorganic compound and organic compound<br>
The insulation coating according to the present invention<br>
can contain other inorganic compound and/or organic compound<br>
which is not copolymerized with polysiloxane at a level not<br>
deteriorates the effect of the prevent invention. As for the<br>
inorganic compound, for example, other oxide (sol) can be added<br>
if the liquid stability is assured. Applicable oxide (sol)<br>
includes silica (sol), (silica or silica sol, same is applied in<br>
the following), alumina(sol), titania(sol), tin oxide(sol),<br>
cerium oxide sol, antimony oxide(sol), tungsten oxide(sol), and<br>
molybdenum oxide(sol). For the case of specifically small<br>
blending ratio of polysiloxane, the addition of inorganic<br>
compound is preferred to improve adhesion property, corrosion<br>
resistance, and removal property of stiction of annealed sheet.<br>
The inorganic compound is added preferably by an amount of 75%<br>
by mass or less, more preferably 40% by mass or less, to the total<br>
solid content in the coating. Preferably the adding amount<br>
thereof is 5% by mass or more, and more preferably 10% by mass<br>
or more.<br>
The organic compound which is not copolymerized with<br>
polysiloxane includes an organic resin similar to the<br>
above-described organic resin which is copolymerized with<br>
polysiloxane.<br><br>
The present invention aims to obtain good coating<br>
characteristics without adding chromium compound. Therefore,<br>
from the point of preventing the environmental pollution caused<br>
by the manufacturing process and by the products, preferably the<br>
insulation coating of the present invention substantially does<br>
not contain chromium. The allowable chromium amount as impurity<br>
is preferably regulated to 0.1% by mass or less as CrO3 to the<br>
total mass of solid content (total coating amount) in the<br>
insulation coating.<br><manufacturing method><br>
The following is the description about the method for<br>
manufacturing the electrical steel sheet having the insulation<br>
coating according to the present invention.<br>
The preliminary treatment for the electrical steel sheet<br>
used as the starting material of the present invention is not<br>
specifically limited. Non-preliminary treatment or preliminary<br>
treatment is applicable. Preferred preliminary treatment<br>
includes degreasing by alkali or the like, and pickling by<br>
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
On the steel sheet, there is applied a coating liquid which<br>
contains above-described polysiloxane and the cross-linking<br>
agent. There are several known applicable methods of<br>
copolymerization to obtain the polysiloxane polymer, including<br>
the method of copolymerization of monomers, the method of<br>
preparing a polymer of one of the monomers, followed by<br><br>
copolymerizing the polymer with other monomer, and the method<br>
using one copolymer as the basis, while polymerizing other<br>
monomer or other copolymer as a branch.<br>
After that, baking treatment is given to the surface of<br>
the electrical steel sheet applied with the above coating liquid,<br>
thus forming the insulation coating on the electrical steel sheet.<br>
The treatment provides formation of dense and strong<br>
three-dimensional network in the coating.<br>
At this step, the coating liquid preferably has the<br>
blending ratio of polysiloxane within a range from 10 to 90% by<br>
mass as SiO2 to the total solid content. As described above, the<br>
blending ratio thereof of less than 10% by mass results in reduced<br>
percentage of remained coating after the stress relieving<br>
annealing, which may deteriorate the removal property of stiction.<br>
When the blending ratio of polysiloxane increases, the coating<br>
becomes strong. If, however, the blending ratio thereof exceeds<br>
90% by mass, the flexibility becomes insufficient, and the<br>
corrosion resistance may deteriorate depending on the<br>
manufacturing conditions.<br>
The raw material of the coating to be applied on the<br>
electrical steel sheet is preferably aqueous or oily material<br>
of paste or liquid type. From the point not to increase<br>
unnecessarily the coating thickness (coating weight), however,<br>
the raw material thereof is preferably of liquid type with the<br>
basis of water or organic solvent. In the following description,<br><br>
the term "coating liquid" also includes the paste type in<br>
principle.<br>
Applicable method for applying the insulation coating<br>
adopts varieties of apparatuses used generally in industries,<br>
such as roll coater, flow coater, spray, knife coater, and bar<br>
coater.<br>
Also for the baking method, ordinarily applied ones can<br>
be used, such as hot air type, infrared heating type, and induction<br>
heating type. The baking temperature may be at an ordinary level.<br>
To avoid thermal decomposition of the resin, however, the baking<br>
temperature is preferably selected to 350°C or below, and more<br>
preferable range is 150°C or above and 300°C or below.<br><coating weight of insulation coating><br>
Although the coating weight of the insulation coating is<br>
not specifically limited, it is preferred to regulate the range<br>
from 0.05 g/m2 or more to 10 g/m2 or less per one coating side,<br>
and more preferably from 0.1 g/m2 or more to 10 g/m2 or less per<br>
one coating side. If the coating weight thereof is less than<br>
0.05 g/m2, industrial means is difficult to attain uniform<br>
application, and in some cases, stable punchability and corrosion<br>
resistance cannot be attained. If the coating weight thereof<br>
exceeds 10 g/m2, further improvement of coating performance<br>
cannot be obtained, and economy may be lost. The measurement<br>
of coating weight is conducted on the steel sheet which completed<br>
baking treatment and does not receive stress relieving annealing,<br>
and the measurement can adopt the weight method in which only<br><br>
the coating is dissolved in hot-alkali or the like, and the weight<br>
change before and after dissolving is determined.<br>
Preferred range of coating weight after the stress<br>
relieving annealing is from about 0.01 g/m2 or more to about 9.0<br>
g/m2 or less.<br>
The insulation coating according to the present invention<br>
is preferably formed on both sides of the steel sheet. Depending<br>
on the object, however, the insulation coating may be formed only<br>
on one side thereof. That is, depending on the object, the<br>
insulation coating according to the present invention is formed<br>
only on one side of the steel sheet, while other side is coated<br>
by other insulation coating, or other side is left non-coating.<br><use embodiments><br>
The applications of the electrical steel sheet having the<br>
insulation coating according to the present invention are not<br>
specifically limited. To utilize the heat resistance of the<br>
coating, however, most suitable application is to use the<br>
electrical steel sheet being subjected to stress relieving<br>
annealing at an approximate temperature range from 750 °C to 850 °C.<br>
For example, specifically suitable use is the manufacture of<br>
laminated iron core by punching electrical steel sheets, and by<br>
applying stress relieving annealing to them, then by laminating<br>
them.<br>
[EXAMPLES]<br>
(EXAMPLE 1)<br><br>
The effect of the present invention is described in detail<br>
referring to the examples. However, the present invention is<br>
not limited to these examples.<br>
As the electrical steel sheet, there was adopted a fully<br>
processed electrical steel sheet which contained the steel<br>
components of 0.45% by mass Si, 0.25% by mass Mn, and 0.48% by<br>
mass Al, and which was treated by finish annealing having a sheet<br>
thickness of 0.5 mm. The coating liquid was prepared by adding<br>
the respective cross-linking agents given in Tables 1 and 3 to<br>
the polysiloxane polymers obtained by copolymerizing, in advance,<br>
polysiloxane with the respective organic resins under the<br>
respective conditions given in Tables 1 and 3. Thus prepared<br>
coating liquid was applied on the surface of the respective<br>
electrical steel sheets using roll coater. The coated steel<br>
sheets were baked in a hot-air furnace at a baking temperature<br>
of 230°C as the peak metal temperature, thus prepared the<br>
respective specimens. For some of Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples, the chemicals given in Tables 1 and 3 were added as<br>
the component other than the polysiloxane polymer.<br>
For thus prepared specimens (electrical steel sheets<br>
