				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a ring spinning machine.<br>
Ring spinning machines are used for producing short staple or long staple yarn from roving or from sliver. Conventional ring spinning machine has a plurality of spindles mounted on a ring frame and the yarn produced is wound on bobbins provided on these spindles.<br>
Long length spinning frames housing at least a thousand spindles are very common now. Though there are practical problems associated with operating a large number of spindles, due to considerable reduction in cost, operation, maintenance and space, the trend in textile industry is for multiple spindle ring spinning machinery.<br>
A major drawback while operating long spinning frames with a large member of spindles is the considerable downtime for cleaning and maintenance. Stoppage of the machine is also necessary during piecing of yarn. Simultaneous piecing of yarn produced on both sides of the ring spinning machine would require more man power. Drive also requires to be disengaged or engaged manually.<br>
In order to overcome the above discussed drawbacks, bottom rollers on both sides of the spindle are run by independent driving means provided on each end. Bottom rollers are also segmented such that stopping of one set of rollers would not affect the running of the other rollers on the same or opposite sides. Maintenance schedule also may be preprogrammed for sequentially engaging and disengaging each segment of the rollers  such that during the maintenance of one set of  rollers,<br><br>
the production and running of the other portions of the machine are not affected. The downtime is thereby reduced as much as SOX.<br>
Ring frames are provided with plurality of suction tubes below the bottom cylinder to suck the fibres in case of end breaks. In longer machines, the suction pressure at the suction tubes drop significantly at the far end of the suction system. The suction efficiency is considerably improved as suction systems are provided on both ends of the machine deviced by us.<br>
Conventional spinning machines are provided with spindles in a row on both sides of the longitudinal section. The front roller of the drafting zone is arranged diagonally above the spindle. The drafted roving travels through the front roller and reaches the spindle through a lappet arranged in alignment with the centre of the spindle. During operation, lappet travels up and down to introduce a twist in the yarn, upto the nipping points. This also helps to maintain uniform tension in the yarn for winding it on a bobbin mounted on the top part of the spindle. Angles formed by the yarn in respect of the vertical plane of the lappet is known as the spinning angle and is determined by the height and distance between the nipping point of the yarn in the front roller and the centre point of the lappet.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide multiple spinning angles to enable the operation or the machine interchangeably between these spinning angles, depending on the count and quality of the yarn to be processed. A set of interchangeable spinning boxes having at least two types of spinning boxes of different width and mounting holes are provided<br><br>
for modifying the spinning angle desirably. Mounting holes are provided at different heights for increasing/decreasing the distance between the nipping points of the front rollers and lappet. For instance, a spinning box with higher width increases the distance between the spindles on two sides of the machine and reduces the distance between the nipping point and lappet. The height between the front rollers and the lappet is increased/decreased by selecting the mounting holes. The side of the spinning box near the spinning rail has at least two mounting holes or means. These spinning boxes are located between the spinning frame and an intermediate frame. The side of the box adjacent to the intermediate frame has at least three mounting means.<br>
In conventional spinning machines, the roving passes between cots and aprons in the drafting zone through a condensing means. If the roving travels on a single path, considerable roving breaks occur. This also reduces the life of the cot; condensing roving bars are continuously traversed to allow the roving to pass through a predetermined width. Primary and secondary traversing are already known in the art. The speed of this primary and secondary traversing is preset. This invention provides means for changing the preset speeds of primary and secondary traversing of the condensing bar based on the yarn count to be processed. A control system consisting of a programmable microprocessor connected to a voltage source, linear actuator and a position sensor is connected to the shaft for controlling the speed of primary and secondary traverse. Smaller stroke lengths are achieved by controlling the voltage of the drive.<br><br>
In another embodiment, this invention provides programmable control means for lifting the ring rail to the desired level for traveller replacement. The program and control means has a warning system such as a warning light to indicate that traveller replacement is due. After such replacement, the ring rail is automatically restored to the actual position.<br>
In yet another embodiment, air used for cooling the main motor is recycled to cool the control panels and servomotors.<br>
The control system is programmed for periodic maintenance schedule with automatic warning and display device. Details of process parameters, downloading data and net working means are provided in the control means which is a microprocessor.<br>
The ring spinning machine according to this invention comprises drafting zone, spinning zone, control means and drive means wherein said spinning zone has plurality of spingles mounted on the longitudinal sides of a ring frame having at least one intermediate frame member connected thereto, through a set of interchangeable spinning boxes, the sides of said box adjacent to said intermediate frame member and the side opposite thereto, have at least three and two mounting means respectively, said drafting zone consisting of a set of top, middle, rear and bottom rollers, each said top rollers being disposed diagonally above each spindle, said drafting rollers are segmented into at least two separately drivable groups on either side of said ring frame, drive means being provided with synchronising means for individually driving said segmented rollers, and control and regulating means provided for controlling the speed of  primary<br><br>
and secondary traversing of roving condensor.<br>
This invention will be further described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. I is a sectional view which shows the spinning zones on both the sides of the machine. The incoming roving is indicated by reference numeral (1). The roving is guided by means of top arm (2) to top, middle, rear and bottom rollers represented by T, M, R and B respectively. Suction channel is shown by numeral (3). Spindle indicated by reference numeral (4) is driven by tape driving means 6. Numeral 5 indicates mounting means for mounting the spindle 4. Spinning box is indicated by numeral 7. The intermediate frame drive shaft with the intermediate frame member are indicated by reference numerals 8 and 9 respectively.<br>
Fig II shows the circuit diagram by the control means for controlling the speed of primary and secondary traverse of the condensor.<br>
C represents the programmed microprocessor control unit which is connected to V, a voltage source. LA is a linear actuator connected to the voltage source and S is the sensor for position sensing. The circuit is connected to the shaft Sh of the drive and the voltage is regulated to increase or decrease the speed of primary and secondary traverse as desired.<br>
Though this invention is described and illustrated with specific embodiments, alterations and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are not excluded from the appended claims.<br><br><br>
