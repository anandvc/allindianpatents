				<td>OXY SUBSTITUTED CHALCONES AS ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AND ANTIDYSLIPIDEMIC AGENTS Field Of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to synthesis of suitably substituted chalcone derivatives which exhibit pronounced antihyperglycemic activity in conjunction with antidyslipedemic activity. More particularly the invention relates to synthesis of compound having formula I and pharmaceutical composition containing these compounds, as described in the following description. Background of the Invention and Prior art<br>
Type II diabetes mellitus accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. Changed sedentary life style has contributed towards affliction of the disease to adult population also. The main force driving this increasing incidence is a staggering increase in obesity, the single most important contributor to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Prolonged disease condition leads to chronic macrovascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. The disease is collectively referred, as metabolic syndrome encompasses type II diabetes and common constellation of closely linked clinical features. Characteristic factors include insulin resistance per se, obesity, hypertension and a common form of dyslipidemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Metabolic syndrome is associated with marked increased incidence of coronary, cerebral and peripheral artery disease [Executive summary of the third report of the National Cholesterol Program Expert Panel on detection, evaluation and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults (2001), J. Am. Med. Asso. 285, 2486-2496.].<br>
The role of peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus is undisputed. Insulin resistance can be due to multiple defects in signal transduction such as impaired activation of insulin receptor-tyrosine kinase and reduced activation of insulin-stimulated phosphatidyl inositol-3-hydroxy kinase. The resistance of insulin due to diet-induced obesity [Elchebly, M. et al. (1999), Science, 283, 1544.] has given the critical role of obesity in the development of insulin resistance and other features of the metabolic syndrome. Successful approaches attenuating appetite and/or enhancing energy expenditure will prove of great benefit in preventing and treating type II diabetes. Abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism are increasingly recognized as key components of the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes. A critical player in potentiating the promoting effect of<br>
hyperinsulinaemia on hepatic lipid accumulation is the anabolic transcription factor SREBP-1, which upregulates genes such as that for fatty acid synthase [Shimomura, I. et al. (2000), Mol. Cell, 6, 77-86.]. These observations support a unified "lipotoxicity" hypothesis, which states that metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes can be caused by the accumulation of triglycerides and long chain fatty-acyl-CoA in liver and muscle. The third causal factor of metabolic syndrome is oxidative stress. Excess levels of oxygen in the living body can also pose a serious health threat; the so-called oxygen toxicity is brought about by oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and oxy radicals and damage living tissue. The active oxygen species are associated with diabetes mellitus and are destructive towards various tissues as occurring in diabetes mellitus. There have been many reports discussing relationships between peroxidation and diseases such as diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia in terms of radical oxidation. Glucose is oxidized under oxidative stress to highly reactive species, which ultimately reacts with proteins. Glucose, like other alpha hydroxy aldehydes, can enolize and thereby reduce molecular oxygen under physiological conditions, catalyzed by transition metals, yielding alpha keto aldehydes and oxidizing intermediates. These secondary compounds are more reactive than monosaccharides and can react with proteins to form cross-linked Maillard products (Simon P. Wolff et al. (1991); Free Radical Biology and Medicine, 10, 339-352.).<br>
Oxidative stress also modifies lipids. Like glucose, LDL also undergoes oxidative modification to form modified LDL (oxidized LDL). The actual oxidation process is believed to begin with lipid peroxidation, followed by fragmentation to give short chain aldehydes. These aldehydes in turn react with the lysine residues of apo-B, creating a new epitope, which is recognized by the scavenger receptor of macrophages. During this same process, lecithin is converted to lysolecithin, which is a selective chemotactic agent for monocytes. The monocytes enter the subendothelium and undergo a phenotypic change to a macrophage, which avidly take up the oxidized LDL via the scavenger receptor. The uptake of oxidized LDL continues until the macrophage is so engorged with cholesteryl esters that it transforms into a foam cell. Groups of these foam cells constitute a fatty streak, the earliest hallmark of atherosclerosis. By inhibiting the oxidation of LDL, it is hoped that the modification of apo B and the production of chemotactic lysolecithin can be prevented and inturn the atherosclerosis.<br>
At present, therapy for type II diabetes relies mainly on several approaches intended to reduce the hyperglycemia itself: sulphonylureas which increase insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells; metformin which acts to reduce hepatic glucose production, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-y agonists which enhance insulin action and a-glucosidase inhibitors which interfere with gut glucose absorption. These therapies have limited efficacy, limited tolerability and mechanism-based toxicity. Of particular concern is the tendency for most treatments to enhance weight gain. A problem particular to the sulphonylureas is that many patients who respond initially become refractory to treatment overtime.<br>
The increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated comorbidities including type II diabetes and related cardiovascular disorders has stimulated efforts to develop effective new approaches in the treatment of this condition. While most therapeutic approaches involve altering the balance of metabolic energy by reducing energy intake, an alternative approach for the management of obesity is to affect an increase in the rate of energy expenditure. In 1984, compounds of the phenethanolamine class (as shown below), having thermogenic properties in rodents were first disclosed. Despite their structural similarity to known Pi and p2 adrenoceptor ligands, pharmacological studies indicated that these compounds stimulated a third or 'atypical' P-adrenergic receptor (P-AR) that is now described as p3-AR. P3 agonist also increased insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization. Later studies suggested that Tyr 64 Arg P3-AR mutation in the human population plays a role in the development of diabetes mellitus and/or obesity in some individuals possessing this genetic variant [Turner, N. C; (1996), DDT, 1, 109-116].<br><br>

A family of transcription factors, known as PPAR-y plays a crucial role in regulating the storage and catabolism of dietary energy producing materials. There are three PPAR subtypes that are the products of distinct genes and are commonly designated as PPPAR a, y and 8. PPAR-y affect body weight through regulation of<br>
fatty acid catabolism or energy expenditure. PPAR-y expressed mainly in adipose<br>
tissue plays a pivotal role in regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis [Willson, T.<br>
M. et al. (2000), J. Med. Chem. 43, 527-550].<br>
Troglitazone   effectively   reduces   hyperglycemia,   hyperinsulinaemia   and<br>
hypertriglyceridemia   in   patients   with   type   II   diabetes.   The   mechanism   of<br>
pharmacological effects has been shown to involve increased insulin sensitivity<br>
effects in skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue via the activation of PPAR-y. As<br>
vitamin-E   analogue,   troglitazone   has  been  demonstrated  to   be   an  effective<br>
antioxidant; oxidative ring opening and subsequent quinone metabolite formation is<br>
believed to be the cause of hepatotoxicity and withdrawal of the drug [Kan He, et al.<br>
(2001), Biochemical Pharmacology, 62, 191-198.]. This has led to the modification and resulted in several new molecules.<br>

Grafting of pharmacophores on systems own or very close metabolites may exhibit some times undesired effects. For example first generation of statins though derived from fungal metabolite, is very close analogue of mevalonic acid and therefore function as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, block mevalonate production which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and hence cholesterol synthesis is inhibited in the cell. Mevalonate is a common precursor for all isoprenoids such as ubiquinones (co enzyme Q 10), the dolichols, and isopentenyl tRNA etc. Therefore, there is a decrease in the synthesis of non-sterol constituents, which may contribute significantly to the side effects, observed with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Similarly in designing of troglitazone, vitamin-E component was used which<br>
metabolized to quinonoid intermediate after one electron oxidation. This intermediate is speculated to be the cause of toxicity of troglitazone.<br>
Flavonoids are among the most ubiquitous groups of polyphenolic compounds in foods of plant origin. Chalcones and flavones are among various subgroups of flavonoids. As integral constituents of the diet, they may exert a wide range of beneficial effects on human health. Flavonoids produce such biological effects through their free radical scavenging antioxidant activities and metal ion chelating abilities. (Cotelle, N. et al, Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1992, 13, 211.). These properties led us to utilize chalcones for the synthesis of hybrid molecules as antidiabetic and antidyslipidemic agents by substitution with thermogenic as well as insulin sensitizing pharmacophores.

All the chalcones [7-12] were prepared using the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which has been previously reported (Sogawa, S.; Nihro, Y.; Ueda, H.; Izumi, A.; Miki, T.; Matsumosa, H.; Satoh, T. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 3904). Hydroxy acetophenone [1-3] and appropriately substituted benzaldehyde [4-6] were reacted using aqueous sodium hydroxide in methanol at room temperature to provide corresponding chalcones [7-12]. Chalcones 10-12 were prepared under reflux. Yields ranged from 65% to quantitative. The chalcones were always obtained as trans-alkenes (E-form) as judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The chalcones thus obtained were reacted with epichlorohydrin using sodium hydride as base in dry dimethyl formamide. The purified epoxide [13-17] was heated under reflux with various amines in methanol to yield corresponding propanolamines [18-35] as presented in Scheme 1 (Table 1). Scheme 1<br>

The biological screening of the synthesized compounds for antihyperglycemic and antidyslipidemic activities were carried out in Biochemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute. Sucrose loaded rat model was used for primary screening followed by streptozotocin induced beta cell damaged diabetic model of Sprague Dawley strain male albino rat model. The compounds, which exhibited significant activity repeatedly in STZ model, were subjected to screen in db/db mice. The serum of the mice was also analyzed for lipid profile of the compounds exhibiting antihyperglycemic activity. All the compounds were also screened for antidyslipidemic activity in triton model. Evaluation of antihyperglycemic activity Sucrose loaded rat model (SLM)<br>
Male albino rats of Charles Foster/Wistar strain of average body weight 160 ± 20 g were selected for this study. The blood glucose level of each animal was checked by glucometer using glucostrips (Boehringer Mannheim) after 16 h starvation. Animals showing blood glucose levels between 3.33 to 4.44 mM (60 to 80 mg/dl) were divided into groups of five to six animals in each. Animals of experimental group were administered suspension of the desired synthetic compound orally (made in 1.0% gum acacia) at a dose of 100-mg/kg-body weight. Animals of control group were given an equal amount of 1.0% gum acacia. A sucrose load (10.0 g/kg) was given to each animal orally exactly after 30 min post administration of the test sample/vehicle. Blood glucose profile of each rat was again determined at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post administration of sucrose by glucometer. Food but not water was withheld from the cages during the course of experimentation. Quantitative glucose tolerance of each animal was calculated by Area Under Curve (AUC) method (Prism Software). Comparing the AUC of experimental and control groups determined the<br>
percentage antihyperglycemic activity. Statistical comparison was made by Dunnett's<br>
test.<br>
Sucrose-challenged streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-S)<br>
Male albino rats of Sprague Dawley strain of body weight 160±20g were selected for this study. Streptozotocin (Sigma, USA) was dissolved in 100 mM citrate buffer pH 4.5 and calculated amount of the fresh solution was injected to overnight fasted rats (45 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Blood glucose level was checked 48 h later by glucostrips and animals showing blood glucose values between 144 to 270 mg/dl (8 to 15 mM) were included in the experiment and termed diabetic. The diabetic animals were divided into groups consisting of five to six animals in each group. Animals of experimental groups were administered suspension of the desired test samples orally (made in 1.0% gum acacia) at a dose of 100-mg/kg-body weight. Animals of control group were given an equal amount of 1.0% gum acacia. A sucrose load of 2.5-g/kg body weight was given after 30 minutes of compound administration. After 30 minutes of post sucrose load blood glucose level was again checked by glucostrips at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 min and at 24 h, respectively. Animals not found diabetic after 24 hours post treatment of the test sample were not considered and omitted from the calculations and termed as non-responders. The animals, which did not show any fall in blood glucose profile in a group while the others in that group, showed fall in blood glucose profile were also considered as non-responders. Food but not water was withheld from the cages during the experimentation. Comparing the AUC of experimental and control groups determined the percent antihyperglycemic activity. Statistical comparison between groups was made by Student's 't' test.<br>
Average blood glucose level of test % Antihyperglycemic Activity = 100 - substance treated group at test time       x 100<br>
Average blood glucose level of control<br>
group at test time Evaluation of antidyslipidemic activity Triton model<br>
Male Charles foster rats weighing 200-225 g were divided into control, hyperlipidemic and hyperlipidemic plus drug treated groups containing six animals in each group. Hyperlipidemia was induced by administration of triton WR-1339 (200 mg/kg i.p.). All animals were maintained on a special pellet diet and water ad libitum.<br>
Compounds and standard drug were macerated with 0.2% aqueous gum acacia suspension. The suspension was fed orally at the dose of 100 mg/kg simultaneously with triton in drug treated group. The animals of control group received the same amount of gum acacia by similar route of administration. At the end of the experiment, after 18 h, blood was withdrawn from retro orbital plexus and plasma was used for the assay of total cholesterol, phospholipid and triglycerides. Lipid estimation Cholesterol<br>
Cholesterol was estimated using the kit provided by Roche Diagnostics. Cholesterol esters are enzymatically hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase (CE) to cholesterol and free fatty acids. Free cholesterol, including that originally present, is then oxidized by cholesterol oxidase (CO) to cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide combines with hydroxy benzoic acid (HBA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (4 AAA) in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to form a chromophore (quinoneimine dye), which may be quantitated at 500-505 nm. The intensity of red colour formed is directly proportional to the concentration of total cholesterol in the specimen and measured spectrophotometrically (Searcy, C. L. Diagnostic Biochemistry, 1969, McGraw Hill, New York; Ellefson, R. D.; Caraway, W. T. Fundamentals of clinical chemistry, 1976, Ed Tietz NW, 506-515.) Triglycerides<br>
Triglycerides were estimated using the kit provided by Roche Diagnostics. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyses triglycerides to yield glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol kinase converts glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate, which is oxidized by glycerol phosphate oxidase to dihydroxy acetone phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide oxidatively couples with 4-aminoantipyrine and 4-chloro phenol to produce red quinonimine dye. The intensity of red colour formed is directly proportional to the concentration of triglycerides in the specimen and is measured by photometrically (Wahlefeld, A. W.; Bergmeyer, H. U. Ed. Methods of enzymatic analysis, 2nd English edition, New York, NY, Academic press inc, 1831-1840.). Phospholipids<br>
Serum (0.2 mL) and perchloric acid (1.0 mL) was digested at 180°C for 1-1.5 h till the solution became colorless. The liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (Fiske, C. H.; Subbarow, V. J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 1925, 66, 375.). 1 mL of 2.5% ammonium molybdate (prepared in 5 N sulphuric acid) and 0.5 mL reducing agent (4-amino naphthol sulphonic acid, 0.2%), sodium metabisulphite (2.4% w/v in distilled water) was added to the above tubes and mixed well. The reaction mixture was distilled with 2.5 mL of triple distilled water and kept at 60°C in water bath for 20 min. For standard, an appropriate amount of potassium dihydrogen phosphate dissolved in triple distilled water containing 2-10 (ig phosphorous (Pi) was run simultaneously with the experiment tubes. The optical density of the blue colour was recorded at 620 nm against reagent blank. The values of Pi were converted into phospholipid by multiplying with 25 (a constant calibrated from Pi value of lecithin).<br>

Evaluation of antihyperglycemic and antidyslipidemic activity in db/db mice<br>
The db/db mouse is a well-characterized model of type II diabetes. The background for the db/db mouse is the C57BL/Ks strain. The major deficiency of the C57BL/KsBom-db mouse (db/db) is lack of a functional leptin receptor. This leads to defective leptin signaling and a complete lack of feedback from leptin. Both hypothalamic NPY content and secretion are consequently elevated, and this result in hyperphagia and decreased energy expenditure, obesity, insulin-resistance, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The db/db mouse develops NIDDM from around week 10. The disease is stable until week 20, where destruction of pancreatic P-cells can be recognized clinically as decreasing levels of plasma insulin and very severe hyperglycemia. The male mice are more diabetic than female and will normally die earlier. The advantage of using male mice for experimental purposes is that the fluctuations in plasma parameters are less than in the females where the estrogen cycle affects the clinical diabetes mellitus. The optimal age of db/db mice used for experiments will be from week 12 to 18 when they have developed NIDDM with diabetic dyslipidemia but still have functional P-cells in the pancreas. C57BL/KsBom-db mice 12-18 weeks, 40-50 g bred in the animal house of CDRI, Lucknow. 10 male mice were used in the experiments. The mice were housed in groups of 5 individuals in a room controlled for temperature (23 ± 2° C) and 12/12 hours light/dark cycle (lights on at 6.00 am). Body weight was measured daily from day 1 to day 10. All animals had free access to fresh water and to normal chow except on the days of the postprandial protocol day 6 and during the overnight fast before the OGTT on day 10. Blood glucose was checked every morning up till day 5. On day 6 postprandial protocol was employed, in this method blood glucose was checked at -0.30 min and 0 h. Test compounds were given to the treatment group whereas control<br>
group received only gum acacia (1.0%); the blood glucose was again checked at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h post test compound treatment. Finally on day 10 an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after an overnight fasting. Blood glucose was measured at -0.30 min and test drugs were fed, blood glucose was again measured at 0.0 min post treatment, at this juncture glucose solution was given at a dose of 3 gm/kg to all the groups including control group; the profile of blood glucose was checked at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min post glucose administration. Quantitative glucose tolerance of each animal was calculated by Area Under Curve (AUC) method (Prism Software). Comparing the AUC of experimental and control groups determined the percentage antihyperglycemic activity. Statistical comparison was made by Dunnett's test. Lipid estimation<br>
Cholesterol and triglycerides were estimated using the same procedures as given above. HDL-Cholesterol<br>
HDL- Cholesterol was estimated using the kit provided by the Roche Diagnostics. Cholestest N HDL is a liquid reagent that directly measures the HDL-cholesterol concentration in serum by a new method that is based on the selective solubilising effect of proprietary detergent to the different lipoproteins. In the assay system, only HDL is solubilised by a special detergent; other lipoproteins are not disrupted. After HDL is selectively disrupted, HDL cholesterol is measured enzymatically (Gordon, T.; Casstelli, W. P.; Hjortland, M. C; Kannel, W. B.; Dawber, T. R. High density lipoproteins as a protective factor against coronary heart disease, Am. J. Med. 1977, 62, 707-714.). Table 4: Antihyperglycemic activity in db/db mice<br><br>
