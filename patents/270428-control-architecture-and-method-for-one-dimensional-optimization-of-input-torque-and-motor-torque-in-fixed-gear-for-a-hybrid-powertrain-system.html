				<td>CONTROL ARCHITECTURE AND METHOD FOR ONE-DIMENSIONAL<br>
OPTIMIZATION OF INPUT TORQUE AND MOTOR TORQUE IN FIXED<br>
GEAR FOR A HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for powertrain<br>
control systems employing electro-mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline. Electrical machines, operatively connected to an electrical<br>
energy storage device, comprise motor/generators operable to generate motive<br>
torque for input to the transmission, independently of torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electrical machines are further operable to<br>
transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to<br>
electrical energy potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage<br>
device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the<br>
operator and provides operational control of the powertrain system, including<br>
controlling transmission gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative<br>
devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical<br>
energy storage device and the electrical machines.<br>
[0003] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear modes and continuously variable modes through<br>
actuation of the torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic<br>
circuit to effect clutch actuation. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational<br><br>
speed of the transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of<br>
the input member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more<br>
torque-transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when<br>
rotational speed of the transmission output member is variable based upon<br>
operating speeds of one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines<br>
can be connected to the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct<br>
connection. Clutch actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a<br>
hydraulic circuit.<br>
[0004] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions are tasked with implementing control schemes to<br>
monitor system states and control operation of various systems and actuators<br>
to effectively control powertrain operation. Such a system is described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and an<br>
apparatus are provided to control operation of a powertrain system comprising<br>
a electro-mechanical torque transmission device operative to transmit torque<br>
input from a plurality of torque-generative devices.<br>
[0006] The method comprises operating the powertrain to determine a range<br>
of permissible input torques from the internal combustion engine to the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission. States for input torque from the range of<br>
permissible torques are iteratively selected, and a motor torque output from the<br>
first electrical machine is optimized based upon the selected state for the input<br>
torque. A motor torque output from the second electrical machine is<br>
determined based upon the optimized motor torque output from the first<br>
electrical machine. A cost for each of the iteratively selected states for the<br>
input torque and the motor torques from the first and second electrical<br>
machines is calculated. A preferred input torque is identified based upon the<br>
plurality of costs.<br><br>
[0007] The invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon<br>
reading and understanding the following detailed description of the<br>
embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0009] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0010] Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0011] Fig. 3 is a graphical depiction, in accordance with the present<br>
invention; and,<br>
[0012] Figs. 4 - 9 are schematic flowcharts, in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The control scheme described<br>
herein comprises a method to determine operating conditions for a powertrain<br>
comprising an internal combustion engine and a hybrid transmission<br>
selectively operative to transmit torque therebetween. The method comprises<br>
determining a torque output and an operating cost for operating the electrical<br>
machines of the hybrid transmission effective to meet an operator torque<br>
request when the engine is operating in an engine-off operating state, effective<br><br>
to meet the operator torque request. Determining torque output for operating<br>
the electrical machines comprises executing a predetermined system equation<br>
effective to determine motor torque outputs from each of the electrical<br>
machines based upon the selected state value for the input torque and the<br>
operator torque request.<br>
[0014] Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, an exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system is depicted, comprising an engine 14, transmission 10, control system,<br>
and driveline 90 which has been constructed in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system is configured to execute the tactical control scheme for controlling the<br>
engine depicted in Figs. 3-9. Mechanical aspects of the exemplary<br>
transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical<br>
Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios", which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmission embodying the concepts of the present invention is<br>
depicted in Fig. 1. The transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12 having an<br>
input speed, N1 that is preferably driven by the internal combustion engine 14,<br>
and an output shaft 64 having an output rotational speed, No. The engine 14<br>
has a crankshaft having characteristic speed NE which is operatively connected<br>
to the transmission input shaft 12. When a torque converter clutch device (not<br>
shown) operatively connects the engine and transmission, the engine speed NE<br>
and output torque TE can differ from transmission input speed N, and input<br>
torque T1.<br>
[0015] The transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28,<br>
and four torque-transmittmg devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. An electro hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, is qperative to control actuation and<br>
deactivation of the clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-actuated rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 and C3<br><br>
preferably comprise comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices<br>
grounded to the transmission case 68.<br>
[0016] There is first electrical machine comprising a motor/generator 56<br>
('MG-A'), and a second electrical machine comprising a motor/generator 72<br>
('MG-B') operatively connected to the transmission via the planetary gears.<br>
Transmission output shaft 64 is operably connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to<br>
provide motive output torque, To to vehicle wheels. Each clutch is preferably<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump,<br>
described below, via an electro-hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0017] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-generative<br>
devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, and referred<br>
to as 'T1', 'TA', and 'TB' respectively, as a result of energy conversion from<br>
fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD)<br>
74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter<br>
module ('TPIM') 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an<br>
element of the control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The<br>
TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy to and from MG-A 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical energy to and<br>
from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase AC<br>
machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that is mounted<br>
on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics devices.<br><br>
[0018] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and TPIM 19. A hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides<br>
overarching control and coordination of the aforementioned control modules.<br>
There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices<br>
through which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation of the<br>
powertrain including the transmission 10 through a request for a torque output.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The<br>
LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control parameters and<br>
commands between the various control modules. The specific communication<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate<br>
protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing<br>
between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules<br>
providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle<br>
stability.<br><br>
[00191 The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque request ('TO_REQ') output to driveline<br>
90, the input torque T, originating from the engine, clutch torque, ('TCL_N') for<br>
the N various torque-transfer clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10;<br>
and motor torques TA and TB for MG-A and MG-B. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, including monitoring<br>
various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and executing<br>
control signals for various solenoids to control pressure switches and control<br>
valves contained therein.<br>
[0020] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual input torque, T1, to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12 which translate to<br>
transmission input speed, N1, manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0021] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques (TCL_EST_N) for each of the N clutches C1, C2, C3, and,<br>
C4 and transmission output rotational speed No of shaft 64. Other actuators<br><br>
and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to<br>
the HCP for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids<br>
to actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes,<br>
as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0022] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power,<br>
referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0023] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0024] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br><br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0025] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and Table 1,<br>
below.<br><br>
[0026] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating range states. A first mode, i.e., Mode 1, is<br>
selected when clutch C1 70 is actuated in order to "ground" the outer gear<br>
member of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine 14 can be either on or<br>
off. A second mode, i.e., Mode 2, is selected when clutch C1 70 is released<br>
and clutch C2 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. Again, the engine 14 can be either on<br>
or off. For purposes of this description, Engine Off is defined by engine input<br>
speed, NE, being equal to zero revolutions per minute (RPM), i.e., the engine<br>
crankshaft is not rotating, typically as a result of the engine being decoupled<br>
from the transmission. Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect<br><br>
when the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are<br>
not discussed herein.<br>
[0027] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds at shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each operating range state. The combination of two<br>
modes with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each range state allows the<br>
transmission 10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway<br>
speeds, and meet various other requirements as previously described.<br>
Additionally, the control system coordinates operation of the transmission 10<br>
so as to allow synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0028] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e., either<br>
clutch C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0029] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e., N1/No, is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors or<br>
generators. They are independent of engine to output power flow, thereby<br>
enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any combination<br>
thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio 1 that<br>
motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by power<br>
from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B, through planetary gear set<br>
28 by accepting power from ESD 74.<br><br>
[0030] Referring now to Fig. 3, various transmission operating modes are<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, No, and transmission input<br>
speed, N, for the exemplary powertrain control system shown in Fig. 1 and 2.<br>
The Fixed Ratio operation is shown as individual lines for each of the specific<br>
gear ratios, GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, as described with reference to Table 1,<br>
above. The continuously variable Mode operation is shown as ranges of<br>
operation for each of Mode 1 and Mode 2. The transmission operating range<br>
state is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and continuously variable<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific clutches. The control<br>
system is operative to determine a specific transmission operating mode based<br>
upon various criteria, using algorithms and calibrations executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention. Selection of the<br>
operating range state of the transmission depends primarily on the operator<br>
torque request TO_REQ and the ability of the powertrain to meet that output<br>
torque request.<br>
[0031] Referring to Table 1 and again to Fig. 3, the low range operating state<br>
includes selective actuation of clutches C2, C1, and C4, facilitating operation<br>
in any one of continuously variable Mode 1, and fixed gears GRl, and GR2.<br>
The high range operating state includes selective actuation of clutches C2, C3,<br>
and C4, facilitating operation in any one of continuously variable Mode 2 and<br>
fixed gears GR3 and GR4. The ranges of continuously variable operation for<br>
Mode 1 and Mode 2 can overlap.<br>
[0032] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine the operator torque request TO_REQ, to be executed at shaft<br>
64. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g.,<br>
road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating mode is determined<br>
for the exemplary transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an operator demand for<br>
torque, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously<br><br>
described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external<br>
conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load.<br>
The operating mode may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused<br>
by a control module command to operate of the electrical machines in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating mode can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine<br>
operable to determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The control system manages torque<br>
inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 based upon an<br>
outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system optimization occurs<br>
to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery<br>
charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the<br>
torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br>
required to arrive at the desired torque output, as described hereinbelow.<br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Figs. 4 - 9, controlling operation of a hybrid<br>
powertrain is described, with reference to the exemplary powertrain described<br>
in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Referring specifically to Fig. 4, the method and system<br>
described herein comprise an aspect of strategic control optimization (Block<br>
110), wherein a preferred or desired operating range state (Op_RangeDES) is<br>
selected based primarily upon output speed, No of shaft 64 and the operator<br>
torque request, TO_REQ. Output of the strategic control includes the preferred or<br>
desired operating range state ('Op_RangeDES') and desired input speed<br>
('N1_DES') each which are input to a shift execution control block 120. Other<br>
aspects of the overall architecture for strategic optimization and control of the<br>
exemplary powertrain are described in co-pending U.S. patent application<br>
serial number 11/561,140 (Attorney Docket No. GP-308478-PTH-CD),<br><br>
entitled CONTROL ARCHITECTURE FOR OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL OF A<br>
HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM which is incorporated by reference, and need<br>
not be described herein. Further details can be found in commonly assigned,<br>
co-pending U.S. patent application Serial No.11/561,156 (Attorney Docket<br>
No. GP-308470-PTH-CD), entitled CONTROL ARCHITECTURE FOR SELECTION<br>
OF OPTIMAL MODE OR GEAR AND INPUT SPEED FOR A HYBRID POWERTRAIN<br>
SYSTEM, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The method<br>
comprises the following steps, executed as one or more algorithms in the<br>
control modules of the distributed control module architecture. The method<br>
includes monitoring output of the transmission, typically No, the operator<br>
torque request, TO_REQ, at shaft 64, and, the available battery power PBAT__MIN<br>
and PBAT_MAX. At least one allowable operating range state, described with<br>
reference to Table 1, is identified. A torque range for each of the allowable<br>
range states is determined. A cost for operating in each of the determined<br>
torque ranges is calculated, and one of the determined torque ranges is<br>
selected as a preferred operating range state based upon the calculated costs<br>
for each determined torque range. The powertrain is controlled to the<br>
preferred operating range state thereafter.<br>
[0034] Referring now to Fig. 5, a functional block diagram details the<br>
strategic control block 110 of Fig. 4, and depicts inputs No and TO_REQ to a<br>
strategic manager segment 220, which has outputs to a system constraint<br>
segment 240 and an optimization segment 260. The output of the system<br>
constraint segment 240 is input to the optimization segment 260. The outputs<br>
of the optimization segment 260 are input to the shift stabilization and<br>
arbitration segment 280, which has an output comprising the preferred<br>
operating range state, OP_RangeDES and desired input speed, N1_DES.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Fig. 6, the strategic manager segment 220 includes<br>
operator inputs, typically torque requests and other inputs through the UI 13,<br>
cost structure information, described hereinbelow, and raw strategic inputs,<br>
comprising raw signals related to the hybrid powertrain operating conditions,<br><br>
including those related to the ESD 74. Outputs from the strategic manager<br>
segment 220 comprise cost structure information (COST), strategic inputs<br>
including transmission output speed No, range of available battery power<br>
PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX, and the operator torque request TO_REQ.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Fig. 7, a detailed description of the strategic system<br>
constraints segment 240 is now described. The output speed No is input to<br>
strategic speed constraint segment 230. The speed constraint segment 230<br>
determines minimum and maximum input speeds for operating in each<br>
continuously variable mode, i.e., N1_MIN_M1, N1_MAX_M1, N1_MIK_M2, and<br>
N1_MAX_M2. The minimum and maximum input speeds, the available battery<br>
power PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX, and the operator torque request TO_REQ are output<br>
to strategic system constraints segment 250 which determines the inputs to the<br>
strategic optimization segment 260 for each of the hybrid operating range<br>
states, i.e., GR1, GR2, GR3, GR4, M1_Eng_Off, M1_Eng_On, M2_Eng_Off,<br>
and M2_Eng_On, based upon current operating constraints, specifically output<br>
speed No. There are three output paths 242, 244, 246 from segment 250 which<br>
supply inputs to optimization segment 260. In this invention, output path 244<br>
provides relevant system constraint information, comprising a range of torque<br>
values in form of minimum and maximum input torques (T1_MIN, T1-MAX) for<br>
each of the fixed gear operations, i.e., GR1, GR2, GR3, and, GR4. This<br>
information is communicated to each of segments 270, 272, 274, and 276 of<br>
segment 260.<br>
[0037] Referring now to Fig. 8, the strategic optimization segment 260 is<br>
now described. The allowable hybrid operating range states output from<br>
segment 240 to the strategic optimization segment 260 are used to identify<br>
which of the optimization segments 270, 272, 274 and 276 are to be executed.<br>
Segments 262, 264, 270, 272, 274 and 276 comprise optimization segments<br>
and segments 266 and 268 comprise evaluation segments, wherein an<br>
optimum operating cost (PCOST) is determined for each of the permissible<br>
operating range states, based upon the inputs previously described, including<br><br>
the previously described range of torque values and costs related to<br>
driveability, fuel economy, emissions, and battery life. The optimum<br>
operating cost preferably comprises a minimum operating cost at a powertrain<br>
operating point within the range of attainable torque or speed values for each<br>
operating range state.<br>
[0038] Referring now to Fig. 9, a method to determine preferred operating<br>
conditions for operating the exemplary powertrain in fixed gear mode<br>
operating range state, i.e., any one of GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, is described.<br>
The range of permissible input torque values to the transmission, comprising<br>
minimum and maximum input torques T1_MIN and, T1_MAX are input from<br>
segment 244 to segment 360 for each of blocks 270, 272, 274, and 276. Block<br>
360 comprises a one-dimensional search engine ("ID Search Engine"), which<br>
iteratively generates state values for input torque, [T1]j within the range of<br>
permissible input torques, for execution in an iterative loop 366. The subscript<br>
"j" refers to a specific iteration, and ranges in value from 1 to n. The quantity<br>
of iterations, n, can be generated by any one of a number of methods, either<br>
internal to the search engine, or as a part of the overall method.<br>
[0039] The state value for input torque, [T1]j is input to a system equation<br>
362 comprising a one-dimensional optimization equation from which an<br>
optimum state value for motor torque TA is determined. A state value for<br>
motor torque TB is determined based upon the determined optimum state value<br>
for motor torque TA. The motor torques TA and TB and input torque Tr are<br>
input to a cost function 364, which calculates a cost (PCOST)J for operating the<br>
exemplary powertrain to achieve the specific input torques. The cost<br>
determined each iteration is returned and captured, or analyzed, in the search<br>
engine 360 depending upon specifics of the search engine 360. The search<br>
engine 360 iteratively calculates values for the cost (PCOST)j and identifies a<br>
preferred cost, which comprises a minimum cost for all the iteratively<br>
calculated values in this embodiment. The preferred cost and corresponding<br>
value for input torque [T1, PCOST)PREF are output to block 280 from each of<br><br>
blocks 270, 272, 274, and 276, and comprise a preferred cost for each of the<br>
fixed gear ratios.<br>
[0040] The method includes determining the range of permissible input<br>
torques T1_MIN to T1_MAX. The permissible input torques comprise practical<br>
constraints associated with the specific engine embodiment, and are based<br>
upon operating characteristics of the specific engine used, with limits related<br>
to combustion stability and fuel cutoff. The permissible transmission input<br>
torques and the "n" quantity of iterations are preferably input through line 244<br>
for each of the gears GR1, GR2, GR3, GR4 to segment 360, which comprises<br>
an element of each of segments 270, 272, 274, 276, and comprise an output<br>
from segment 240, described above.<br>
[0041] The range of permissible input torques T1_MIN and T1_MAX comprise<br>
boundary conditions that are input to the one-dimensional search engine 360<br>
including iterative search loop 366. The one-dimensional search engine<br>
comprises any one of several known methods executed as an algorithm in one<br>
of the control modules which is operative to generate state values for T1 within<br>
the ranges of permissible values, output the state values [T1]j to the iteration<br>
loop 366 to determine a correlated cost, (PCOST)J, and evaluate the resultant, i.e.,<br>
[T1, PCOST]J in the search engine 360. The search engine determines a preferred<br>
resultant, i.e., [T1, PCOST]PREF, by comparing the resultant from each iteration<br>
with a previously determined resultant. When the preferred resultant<br>
comprises a minimum value for the correlated cost, the engine 360 selects and<br>
captures and stores the lesser value of the resultant and the previously<br>
determined resultant. When the search engine has executed the search over<br>
the range of state values for T1, the final captured resultant comprises the<br>
preferred resultant, [T1, PCOST]PREF, which is then output to block 280.<br>
[0042] The one-dimensional search engine 360 can comprise any one of<br>
several known search engines operative to iteratively generate a value for T1<br>
within the ranges of permissible values therefor. By way of example, one<br>
such search engine iteratively generates inputs over the entire range of<br><br>
permissible input torques T1_MIN to T1_MAX. By way of example, another search<br>
engine comprises a heuristic sampling search process wherein a state value for<br>
T, is determined for input to the system equation (Block 362), based upon<br>
previously determined state values for T, and PCOST. The one-dimensional<br>
search method solves optimization problems looking for the value of the<br>
objective function, i.e., the output of the cost equation, to be lower than the<br>
value at the current point. Regardless of the search engine utilized, it resides as<br>
an algorithm in one of the control modules for execution during ongoing<br>
operation of the vehicle.<br>
[0043] Each state value for input torque, (T1)j is input to system equation<br>
block 362, from which state values for motor torques TA and TB are<br>
determined. The torque relationship between MG-A and MG-B is as defined<br>
in Eqs 1 and 2, below:<br><br>
wherein T1 is the input torque originating from engine 14, To is the<br>
transmission output torque, i.e., the requested output torque, TO_REQ, TA and TB<br>
are the operating torques for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, N x represents time-<br>
rate change in transmission input speed N,, and d11, d12, d13, d14, and g11, g12,<br>
g13, g14 are known scalar values determined for each of the fixed gears of the<br>
specific application. In this application, when the transmission output torque<br><br>
To is known, there are two degrees of freedom, i.e., T1 and TA, by which TBcan<br>
be optimized and determined, or T1 and TB, by which TA can be optimized and<br>
determined, depending upon the fixed gear operating range state.<br>
[0044] The system equation (Block 362) operates in two parts to determine a<br>
preferred or optimum value for T1 In the first part, an optimum value for TA is<br>
determined for each iterated value for T1, or over the range of permissible<br>
input torques T1-MIN and T1_MAX, and is based upon minimization of the battery<br>
power, PBAT, to operate the electrical motors MG-A and MG-B, which can<br>
comprise a predetermined calibration or a one-dimensional optimization<br>
search. Torque TB is calculated based upon the optimized TA using one of Eq.<br>
1 and Eq. 2, above. Thus the system reduces to a single degree of freedom<br>
i.e., T1, by which TA can be optimized and TB can be determined, or by which<br>
TB can be optimized and TA can be determined.<br>
[0045] The selected state values for T1 and the optimized value for TA and the<br>
calculated state value for motor torque TB are all input to the cost equation<br>
(Block 364) to calculate a cost, PCOST, which is associated with the selected<br>
state values for T1 The input torque and cost [T1, PCOST]J are input back through<br>
the search loop to segment 360, which iteratively executes the one-<br>
dimensional search method over the range of permissible input torques T1 to<br>
converge on a preferred or optimal value for cost, PCOST. The optimal value for<br>
cost, PCOST is preferably a minimum cost value.<br>
[0046] The cost information used in the cost function 364 preferably<br>
comprises operating costs which are generally determined based upon factors<br>
related to vehicle driveability, fuel economy, emissions, and battery life for the<br>
determined torque range. Furthermore, costs in this invention are assigned<br>
and associated with only electrical power consumption associated with a<br>
specific operating point of the powertrain system for the vehicle. Lower<br>
operating costs are generally associated with lower battery power usage, and<br>
lower emissions for an operating point, and take into account a current<br>
operating range state of the powertrain system. The optimum operating cost<br><br>
(PCOST) can be determined by calculating a total powertrain system loss,<br>
comprising an overall system power loss and a cost penalty, such as can be<br>
associated with controlling battery state of charge. The overall system power<br>
loss comprises a term based upon losses in the electrical system (e.g. wire<br>
impedances and switching and solenoid losses), and heat losses. Other losses<br>
include electrical machine power losses and internal battery power losses.<br>
Other factors may also be considered, including factors related to battery life<br>
due to depth of discharge of the ESD 74, current ambient temperatures and<br>
their effect on state of charge of the battery. Operating costs are preferably<br>
developed relative to specific powertrain/vehicle applications during vehicle<br>
calibration pre-production. An exemplary method for determining engine<br>
power losses are described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication Number 2005/0256633 A2, entitled COST STRUCTURE METHOD<br>
INCLUDING FUEL ECONOMY AND ENGINE EMISSION CONSIDERATIONS, the<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0047] The preferred operating range is thus identified based upon the costs,<br>
including the preferred input torque which expends a minimum cost. Ranges<br>
of permissible motor torques from MA and MB can be determined based upon<br>
the range of permissible input torques, based upon available battery power.<br>
This leads to determining a preferred fixed gear operating range state based<br>
upon the preferred input torque.<br>
[0048] The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations<br>
may occur to others upon reading and understanding the specification. It is<br>
