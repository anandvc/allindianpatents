				<td>CERIUM CONTAINING SCINTILLATING MATERIAL AND METHOD OF<br>
GROWING THE SINGLE CRYSTAL SCINTILLATING MATERIAL THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to scintilla tor crystals, to a manufacturing method<br>
allowing them to be obtained and to the use of said crystals, especially in<br>
gamma-ray and/or x-ray detectors.<br>
Scintiilator crystals are widely used in detectors for gamma-rays, x-rays, cosmic<br>
rays and particles whose energy is of the order of 1 keV and also greater than<br>
this value,<br>
A scintiilator crystal is a crystal which is transparent in the scintillation<br>
wavelength range, which responds to incident radiation by emitting a fight puise.<br>
From such crystals, generally single crystals, it is possible to manufacture<br>
detectors in which the light emitted by the crystal that the detector comprises is<br>
coupled to a light-detection means and produces an electrlca! signal proportional<br>
to the number of light pulses received and to their intensity. Such detectors are<br>
used especially in industry for thickness or weight measurements and in the<br>
fields of nuclear medicine, physics, chemistry and oil exploration.<br>
A family of known scintiilator crystals widely used is of the thallium-doped<br>
sodium iodide Tl:Nal type. This scintillating material, discovered in 1943 by<br>
Robert Hofstadter and which forms the basis of modern scintillators, still remains<br>
the predominant material in this field in spite of almost 50 years of research on<br>
other materials. However, these crystals have a scintillation decay which is not<br>
very fast.<br>
A material which is also used is Csl which, depending<br>
On the applications, may be used pure, or doped either with thallium (Tl) or with<br>
sodium (Na),<br>
One family of seintsllator crystals which has undergone considerable development<br>
is of the bismuth germanate (BGO) type. The crystals of the BGO family have<br>
high decay time constants; which limit the use of these crystals to low count<br>
rates.<br>
A more recent family of scintillator crystals was developed in the 1990s and is of<br>
the cerium-activated iutetium oxyorthosilicate Ce:LSO type. However these<br>
crystals are very heterogeneous and have very high melting points (about<br>
2200Â°C).<br>
The development of new scintillating materials for improved performance is the<br>
subject of many studies.<br>
One of the parameters that it is desired to improve is the energy resolution.<br>
This is because in the majority of nuciear detector applications, good energy<br>
resolution is desired. The energy resolution of a nuclear radiation detector<br>
actually determines its ability to separate radiation energies which are very close.<br>
It is usually determined for a given detector at a given energy, such as the width<br>
at mid-height of the peak in question on an energy spectrum obtained from this<br>
detector, in relation to the energy at the centroid of the peak (see in particular:<br>
G.F. Knolf, "Radiation Detection and Measurement, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,<br>
2nd edition, p. 114). In the rest of the text, and for aH measurements carried out,<br>
the resolution is determined at 662 keV, the energy of the main gamma emission<br>
of 137Cs.<br>
The smaller the energy resolution, the better the quality of the detector. It is<br>
considered that energy<br>
resolutions of about 7% enabie good results to be obtained. Nevertheless, lower<br>
values of resolution are of great benefit,<br>
For example, in the case of a detector used to analyze various radioactive<br>
isotopes, improved energy resolution enables improved discrimination of these<br>
isotopes.<br>
An increase in the energy resolution is particularly advantageous for a medical<br>
imaging device, for example of the Anger gamma-camera or positron emission<br>
tomography (PET) type, since it enables the contrast and the quality of the<br>
images to be considerably improved, thus allowing more accurate and earlier<br>
detection of tumors.<br>
Another very important parameter is the scintillation decay time constant; this<br>
parameter is usually measured by the "Start Stop* or "Multi-hit" method",<br>
(described by W.W. Moses (Nucl. Instr and Meth. A336 (1993)253).<br>
The smallest possible decay time constant is desired, so as to be able to increase<br>
the operating frequency of the detectors. In the field of nuclear medical imaging,<br>
this makes it possible, for example, to considerably reduce the length of<br>
examinations. A decay time constant which is not very high also enables the<br>
temporal resolution of devices detecting events with temporal coincidence to be<br>
improved. This is the case for positron emission tomographs (PET), where the<br>
reduction in the scintillator decay time constant enables the images to be<br>
significantly improved by rejecting noncoincident events with more accuracy.<br>
In general, the spectrum of scintillation decay as a function of time may be<br>
broken down into a sum of exponentials, each characterized by a decay time<br>
constant.<br>
The quality of a scintillator is essentially determined by the properties of the<br>
contribution from the fastest emission comoonent.<br>
The standard scintillating materials do not allow both good energy resolutions<br>
and fast decay time constants to be obtained,<br>
This is because materials such as Tl:NaI have good energy resolution under<br>
gamma excitation, of about 7%, but a high decay time constant o" about 230 ns.<br>
Similarly, T1:CsI and Na:CsI have high decay time constants, especially greater<br>
than 500 ns.<br>
Decay time constants which are not very high can be obtained with Ce:LSO,<br>
especially of about 40 ns, but the energy resolution under gamma excitation at<br>
662 keV of this material is generally greater than 10%.<br>
Recently, scintillating materials have been disclosed by 0. Ouillot-Noel et a!.<br>
("Optical and scintillation properties of cerium doped LaCl3,LuBr3 and LuC13" in<br>
Journal of Luminescence 85 (1999) 21-35). This article describes the scintillation<br>
properties of cerium-doped compounds such as LaCla doped with 0.57 mol% Ce;<br>
LuBr3 doped with 0.021 mol%, 0.46 molÂ°/o and 0.76 mol% Ce; LuCl3 doped with<br>
0.45 mo!% Ce. These scintillating mterials have quite useful energy resolutions,<br>
of the order of 7%, and decay time constants of the fast scintillation component<br>
which are fairly low, especially between 25 and 50 ns. However, the intensity of<br>
the fast component of these materials is low, especially of the order of 1000 to<br>
2000 photons per MeV, which means that they cannot be used as a component<br>
of a high-performance detector.<br>
The object of the present application relates to a material capable of having a<br>
low decay time constant.<br>
especially at least equivalent to that of Ce.LSO, and where the intensity of the<br>
first scintillation component is suitable for producing a high-performance<br>
detector, in particular is greater than 4000 ph/MeV (photons per MeV)/ or even<br>
greater than 8000 ph/MeV (photons per MeV) and, in a preferred manner, a<br>
good energy resolution, especially at least as good as that of Tl:NaI.<br>
According to the invention, this aim is achieved by an inorganic scintillating<br>
material of general composition M1-xCexBr3,<br>
Where M is chosen from the lanthanides or mixtures of lanthanides of the<br>
group: La, Gd, Y, especially chosen from the lanthanides or the mixtures of<br>
lanthanides of the group; La, Gd,<br>
and where x is the molar level of substitution of M by cerium,<br>
subsequently called "cerium content", where x is greater than or equal to 0.01<br>
mol% and strictly less than 100 mol%.<br>
The term "lanthanide" refers to the transition elements of atomic numbers 57 to<br>
71, and to yttrium (Y), as is standard in the technical field of the invention.<br>
An inorganic scintillating material according to the invention substantially consists<br>
of M1-xCexBr3 and may also comprise impurities usual in the technical field of the<br>
invention. In general, the usual impurities are impurities coming from the raw<br>
materials whose content is in particular less than 0.1%, or even less than 0.01%,<br>
and/or the unwanted phases whose volume percentage is especially less than<br>
1%,<br>
In fact, the inventors have known how to show that the M1-xCexBr3 compounds<br>
defined above, comprising cerium, have remarkable properties. The scintillation<br>
emission of these materials has an intense fast component (of at least 10000<br>
ph/Mev) and a low decay time constant, of<br>
the order of 20 to 40 ns.<br>
A preferred material according to the invention has the formula La1-xCexBr3; in<br>
fact this material has simultaneously an excellent energy resolution at 662 kev, in<br>
particular less than 5% , and even than 4%.<br>
According to one embodiment, the scintillating material according to the<br>
invention has an energy resolution of less than 5% at 562 kev.<br>
According to another embodiment, the scintillating material according to the<br>
invention has a fast decay time constant of less than 40 ns, or even of Jess than<br>
30 ns.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the scintillating material according to the<br>
invention has both an energy resolution less than 5% at 662 keV and a fast<br>
decay time constant of less than 40 ns, or even less than 30 ns.<br>
In a preferred manner, the cerium content x is at least 1 mol% and is in<br>
particular between 1 and 90 mo(%, and even in particular greater than or equal<br>
to 2 mol%, or even greater than or equal to 4 mol% and/or preferably less than<br>
or equal to SO mol%, or even less than or equal to 30 mol%.<br>
According o another embodiment, the cerium content x Is between 0,01 mol%<br>
and 1 mol%, in particular at least equal to 0.1 mol%, even at least equal to 0.2<br>
mol%. In a preferred manner, the cerium content is substantially equa! to 0.5<br>
mol%.<br>
According to one embodiment, the scintillating material according to the<br>
invention is a single crystal making it possible to obtain components of high<br>
transparency, the dimensions of which are enough to efficiently stop<br>
and detect the radiation to be detected, including at high energy. The volume of<br>
these single crystals is in particular of the order of 10 mm3, or even greater than<br>
1 cm3 and even greater than 10 cm3.<br>
According to another embodiment, the scintillating material according to the<br>
invention is a powder or polycrystal, for example in the form of powders mixed<br>
with a binder or else in the form of a sol-gel.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for obtaining the scintillating material<br>
M1-xCexBr3 defined above, in tine form of a single crystal by the Bridgman growth<br>
method, for example in evacuated seated quartz ampoules, in particular from a<br>
mixture of commercial MBr3 and CeBr3 powders.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the scintillating material above as a<br>
component of a detector for detecting radiation in particular by gamma rays<br>
and/or X-rays.<br>
Such a detector especially comprises a photodetector optically coupled to the<br>
scintillator in order to produce an electrical signal in response to the emission of<br>
a light pulse produced by the scintillator.<br>
The photodetector of the detector may in particular be a photomuitiplier, or else<br>
a photodiode, or else a CCD sensor.<br>
The preferred use of this type of detector relates to the measurement of gamma<br>
or X-ray radiation; such a system is also capable of detecting alpha and beta<br>
radiation and electrons. The invention also relates to the use of the above<br>
detector in nuclear medicine apparatuses, especially gamma cameras of the<br>
Anger type and position emission tomography scanners (see for example C.W.E.<br>
Van Eijk, "Inorganic Scintiiiator for<br>
Medical Imaging", International Seminar New types of Detectors, 15-19 May<br>
1995 - Archamp, France. Published in "Physica Medica", Vol. XII, Supplement 1,<br>
June 96).<br>
According to another variant, the invention relates to the use of the above<br>
detector in detection apparatuses for oil drilling, (see for example "Applocations<br>
of scintillation counting and analysis", in "Photomu!tipSier tube, principle and<br>
application", chapter 7, Philips}.<br>
Other details and characteristics will emerge from the description below of<br>
preferred nonlimiting embodiments and of data obtained on samples constituting<br>
single crystals according to the invention,<br>
Table 1 shows the characteristic scintillation results for examples according to<br>
the invention (examples 1 to 5) and for comparative examples (examles A to G),<br>
X is the cerium content, expressed in mol%, substituted into the atom M.<br>
The measurements are carried out. under y-ray excitation at 662 keV, The<br>
measurement conditions are specified in the publication by 0. Guillot-Noel, cited<br>
above.<br>
The emission intensity is expressed in photons per MeV.<br>
The emission intensity is recorded as a function of the integration time up to 0.5;<br>
3 and 10 microseconds.<br>
The fast scintillation component is characterized by its decay time constant, xt in<br>
nanoseconds, and by its scintillation intensity (in photons/MeV), which represents<br>
the contribution of this component to the total number of photons emitted by the<br>
scintilSator.<br>
The samples used in the measurements of examples are<br>
small single crystals of about 10 mm3.<br>
From table 1, it is noticed that the compounds according to the invention o the<br>
M1-xCexBr3 type comprising cerium (ex1 to ex5) all have very advantageous<br>
decay time constants of fast fluorescence component, between 20 and 40 ns and<br>
lhe scintillation intensity of this fast component is remarkable and is very much<br>
greater than 10000 ph/MeV: in fact it reaches about 40000 ph/MeV.<br>
In addition, the resolution, R%, of the examples according to the invention (exl<br>
to ex4) where MLa, is excellent and has an unexpected nature, with values<br>
between 3 and 4%, which is a considerable improvement with respect to Tl:NaI.<br>
This is because the known ianthanide bromide compounds (examples A, B and<br>
C) do not have as remarkable a set of scintillation characteristics. For example,<br>
the cerium-doped lutetium bromides (examples B and C) have a good resolution,<br>
R%, but the intensity of the fast component is low, very substantially less that<br>
4000 ph/MeV, As for the known Ianthanide fluorides (examples D, E, F, G), they<br>
have a very low emission intensity.<br>
In a particularly surprising manner, the inventors noticed a considerable increase<br>
in the intensity of the fast emission component for the La and Gd bromides<br>
containing cerium.<br>
The scintillating materials according to the invention, in particular the materials<br>
of general composition La1-xCexBr3 have a performance which is particularly<br>
suitable for increasing the performance of detectors, both in terms of energy<br>
resolution, temporal resolution and count rate.<br>
