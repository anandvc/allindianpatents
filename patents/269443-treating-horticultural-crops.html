				<td>BACKGROUND:<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No, 60/800,516 filed on May 15,2006.<br>
Crop plants are often treated by contacting them with compositions. One possible benefit of such treatment is the improvement of crop yield. For example, US Patent Publication 2006/0160704 discloses treating non-citrus plants with compositions that contain at least one cyclopropene and that contain at least one plant growth regulator that is not a cyclopropene. It is desired to provide methods that involve treating certain specific crop plants with liquid compositions at developmental stage or stages appropriate for those specific crop plants.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treating horticultural crop plants comprising the step of contacting said plants one or more times with a liquid composition, wherein said liquid composition comprises one or more cyclopropenes, and wherein said contacting is performed during a reproductive stage of said plants.<br>
L<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
The practice of the present invention involves the use of one or more cyclopropenes. As used herein, "a cyclopropene" is any compound with the formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where each R1, R2, R3 and R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of H and a chemical group of the formula:<br>
-CLVZ<br>
where n is an integer from 0 to 12. Each L is a bivalent radical. Suitable L groups include, for example, radicals containing one or more atoms selected from H, B, C, N, O, P, S, Si, or mixtures thereof. The atoms within an L group may be connected to each other by single bonds, double bonds, triple bonds, or mixtures thereof. Each L group may be linear, branched, cyclic, or a combination thereof. In any one R group (i.e., any one of R1, R2, R3 and R4) the total number of heteroatoms (i.e., atoms that are neither H nor C) is from 0 to 6. Independently, in any one R group the total number of non-hydrogen atoms is 50 or less. Each Z is a monovalent radical. Each Z is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo, cyano, nitro, nitroso, azido, chlorate, bromaie, iodate, isocyanato, isocyanido, isothiocyanato, pentafluorothio, and a chemical group G, wherein G is a 3 to 14 membered ring system.<br>
The R\ R2, R3, and R4 groups are independently selected from the suitable groups. The R\ R2, R3, and R4 groups may be the same as each other, or any number of them may be different from the others.

As used herein, a chemical group of interest is said to be "substituted" if one or more hydrogen atoms of the chemical group of interest is replaced by a substituent. It is contemplated that such substituted groups may be made by any method, including but not limited to making the unsubstituted form of the chemical group of interest and<br>
then performing a substitution. Suitable substituents  include, for example, alkyl, alkenyl, acetylamino, alkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkoxyimio, carboxy, halo, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, alkylsulfonyl, alkylthio, trialkylsilyl, dialkylamino, and combinations thereof. An additional suitable substituent, which, if present, may be present alone or in combination with another suitable substituent, is<br>
  -(L)m-Z<br>
where m is 0 to 8, and where L and Z are defined herein above. If more than one substituent is present on a single chemical group of interest, each substituent may replace a different hydrogen atom, or one substituent may be attached to another substituent, which in turn is attached to the chemical group of interest, or a combination thereof.<br>
Among the suitable R , R , R , and R groups are, for example, substituted and unsubstituted aliphatic-oxy groups, such as, for example, alkenoxy, alkoxy, alkynoxy, and alkoxycarbonyloxy.<br>

The cyclopropenes applicable to this invention may be prepared by any method. Some suitable methods of preparation of cyclopropenes are the processes disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 5,518,988 and 6,017,849.<br>
In some embodiments, one or more composition of the present invention includes at least one ionic complexing reagent. An ionic completing reagent interacts with a cyclopropene to form a complex that is stable in water. Some suitable ionic complexing reagents, for example, include lithium ion. In some embodiments, no ionic complexing reagent is used.<br>
In some embodiments, no composition of the present invention includes any molecular encapsulating agent. In other embodiments, one or more composition of the present invention includes at least one molecular encapsulating agent.<br>
When a molecular encapsulating agent is used, suitable molecular encapsulating agents include, for example, organic and inorganic molecular encapsulating agents. Suitable organic molecular encapsulating agents include, for example, substituted cyclodextrins, unsubstituted cyclodextrins, and crown ethers. Suitable inorganic molecular encapsulating agents include, for example, zeolites. Mixtures of suitable molecular encapsulating agents are also suitable. In some embodiments of the invention, the encapsulating agent is alpha-cyclodextrin, beta-cyclodextrin, gamma-cyclodextrin , or a mixture thereof. In some embodiments<br>
of the invention, particularly when the cyclopropene is 1-methylcyclopropene, the encapsulating agent is alpha-cyclodextrin. The preferred encapsulating agent will vary depending upon the structure of the cyclopropene or cyclopropenes being used. Any cyclodextrin or mixture of cyclodextrins, cyclodextrin polymers, modified cyclodextrins, or mixtures thereof can also be utilized pursuant to the present invention. Some cyclodextrins are available, for example, from WackerBiochem Inc., Adrian, MI or Cerestar USA, Hammond, IN, as well as other vendors.<br>
In some of the embodiments in which a molecular encapsulating agent is present, at least one molecular encapsulating agent encapsulates one or more cyclopropenes. A cyclopropene or substituted cyclopropene molecule encapsulated in a molecule of a molecular encapsulating agent is known herein as a "cyclopropene molecular encapsulating agent complex." The cyclopropene molecular encapsulation agent complexes can be prepared by any means. In one method of preparation, for example, such complexes are prepared: by contacting the cyclopropene with a solution or slurry of the molecular encapsulation agent and then isolating the complex, using, for example, processes disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,017,849. For example, in one method of making a complex in which ;1-MCP is encapsulated in a molecular encapsulating agent, the 1-MCP gas is bubbled through a solution of alpha-cyclodextrin in water, from which the complex first precipitates and is then isolated by filtration. In some embodiments, complexes are made by the above method and, after isolation, are dried and stored in solid form, for example as a powder, for later addition to useful compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, one or more molecular encapsulating agent and one or more cyclopropenes are both present in a composition; in some of such embodiments, the amount of molecular encapsulating agent can usefully be characterized by the ratio of moles of molecular encapsulating agent to moles of cyclopropene. In some embodiments, the ratio of moles of molecular encapsulating agent to moles of cyclopropene is 0.1 or larger; or 0.2 or larger; or 0.5 or larger; or 0.9 or larger. Independently, in some of such embodiments, the ratio of moles of molecular encapsulating agent to moles of cyclopropene is 2 or lower; or 1.5 or lower.<br>
In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention has no abscission agent.<br>
The practice of the present invention involves one or more liquid compositions. Liquid compositions are liquid at 25°C. In some embodiments, liquid compositions are liquid at the temperature at which the composition is used to treat plants. Because plants are often treated outside of any buildings, plants may be treated at temperatures ranging from 1°C to 45°C; suitable liquid compositions need not be liquid over that entire range, bit suitable liquid compositions are liquid at least at some temperature from 1°C to 45°C.<br>
If a liquid composition contains more than one substance, that liquid composition may be a solution or a dispersion or a combination thereof. If, in the liquid composition, one substance is dispersed in another substance in the form of a dispersion, the dispersion may be of any type, including, for example, a slurry, a suspension, a latex, an emulsion, a miniemulsion, a microemulsion, or any combination thereof.<br>
The amount of cyclopropene in the composition may vary widely, depending<br>
on the type of composition and the intended method of use. In some embodiments,<br>
the amount of cyclopropene, based on the total weight of the composition , is 4% by<br>
weight or less; or 1% by weight or less; or 0.5% by weight or less; or 0.05% by<br>
weight or less. Independently, in some embodiments, the amount of cyclopropene,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition , is 0,000001% by weight or more; or<br>
0.00001 % by weight or more; or 0.0001% by weight or more; or 0.001 % by weight<br>
or more.	<br>
Among embodiments of the present invention that use a composition of the present invention that contains water, the amount of cyclopropene may be characterized as parts per million (i.e., parts by weight of cyclopropene per 1,000,000 parts by weight of water in the composition, "ppm") or as parts per billion (i.e., parts by weight of cyclopropene per 1,000,000,000 parts by weight of water in the composition, "ppb"). In some embodiments, the amount of cyclopropene is 1 ppb or more; or 10 ppb or more; or 100 ppb of more. Independently, in some embodiments, the amount of cyclopropene is 10,000 ppm or less; or 1,000 ppm or less.<br>
In some embodiments, a liquid composition of the present invention is used in which some or all of the cyclopropene is encapsulated in one or more encapsulating agent<br>
In some embodiments, no composition of the present invention includes metal-complexing agents. In some embodiments, one or more compositions of the present invention includes one or more metal-complexing agents.<br>
One or more metal-complexirjg agents may be included in one or more liquid compositions. A metal-complexing agent is a compound that is capable of forming coordinate bonds with metal atoms. Some metal-complexing agents are chelating agents. As used herein, a "chelating agent" is a compound, each molecule of which is capable of forming two or more coordinate bonds with a single metal atom. Some metal-complexing agents form coordinate bonds with metal atoms because the metal-complexing agents contain electron-donor atoms that participate in coordinate bonds with metal atoms, Suitable chelating igents include, for example, organic and inorganic chelating agents. Among the suitable inorganic chelating agents are, for example, phosphates such as, for example, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, and hexametaphospnoric acid. Among the suitable organic chelating agents are those with macrocyclic structures and non-macrocyclic structures.<br><br>

polymethacryloylacetones, poly(acrylic acid), and poly(methacrylic acid). Poly(acrylic acid) is used in some embodiments.<br>
Some suitable metal-complexing agents that are not chelating agents are, for example, alkaline carbonates, such as, for example, sodium carbonate.<br>
Metal-complexing agents may be present in neutral form or in the form of one or more salts. Mixtures of suitable metal-complexing agents are also suitable.<br>
En some embodiments of the present invention, no composition contains water. In some other embodiments, the composition of the present invention contains water.<br>
Independently, in some embodiments in which a liquid composition that includes water is used, and in which the liquid composition contains one or more metal-complexing agent, the amount of metal-complexing agent can usefully be characterized by the molar concentration of metal-complexing agent in the liquid composition (i.e., moles of metal-complexing agent per liter of liquid composition). In some of such liquid compositions, the concentration of metal-complexing agent is 0.00001 mM (i.e., milli-Molar) or greater; or 0.0001 mM or greater; or 0.001 mM or greater; or 0.01 mM or greater; or O. imM or greater. Independently, in some embodiments in which a liquid composition of the present invention includes water, the concentration of metal-complexing agent  is 100 mM or less; or 10 mM or less; or 1 mM or less.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, one or more adjuvants is also included in the composition of the present invention. The use of adjuvants is considered optional in the practice of the present invention. Adjuvants may be used alone or in any combination. When mote than one adjuvant is used, it is contemplated that any combination of one or more adjuvants may be used. Some suitable adjuvants are surfactants, alcohols, oils, extenders, pigments, fillers, binders, plasticizers, lubricants, wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, defoamers, thickeners, transport agents, and emulsifying agents.<br>
In some embodiments, a composition of the present invention is used that contains at least one adjuvant selected from alcohols, oils, and mixtures thereof; such a composition may or may not additionally contain one or more surfactant.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, one or more surfactants are used. Suitable surfactants include, for example, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, nomonic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, and mixtures thereof. In<br>
some embodiments, one or more anionic surfactant is used. Mixtures of suitable surfactants are also suitable.<br>
Among embodiments in which one or more liquid compositions are used that include one or more surfactants, some liquid compositions contain surfactant in amounts, by weight based on the total weight of the liquid composition, of 0.025% or more; or 0.05% or more; or0.1% or  more. Independently, some liquid compositions use surfactant in amounts, by weight based on the total weight of the liquid composition, of 75% or less; or 50% or less; or 20% or less; or 5% or less; or 2% or less; 1% or less; or 0.5% or less; or 0.3% or less.<br>
In some of the embodiments, no oil is included in the composition.<br>
Independently, in some of the embodiments, one or more oils are used. As used herein, an "oil" is a compound that is liquid at 25°C and 1 atmosphere pressure and that has a boiling point at 1 atmosphere pressure of 30°C or higher. As used herein, "oil" does not include water, does not include surfactants (as described herein above), and does not include alcohols (as described herein below). Some oils are hydrocarbon oils, while other oils are lion-hydrocarbon oils. Hydrocarbon oils are straight, branched, or cyclic alkane compounds with 6 or more carbon atoms. As used herein, "non-hydrocarbon" means any compound that contains at least one atom that is neither hydrogen nor carbon.<br>
In some embodiments in which a liquid composition is used, one or more hydrocarbon oils are included in the composition.

and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, spraying or dipping or both is used<br><br>
In some embodiments, spraying is used.<br><br>
Some plants are grown for the purpose of removing one or more plant parts,<br>
when such parts are considered a useful product. Such plants are known herein as<br>
"crop plants." Removal of such usefulplant parts is known as harvesting. In the practice of the present invention, plants  that produce useful plant parts are treated with composition of the present invention prior to the harvesting of the useful plant parts.<br>
In such embodiments, each composition  that is used may, independently of any other<br>
compositions that may be used, be brought into contact with all of or with some<br>
portion of the plant. If a composition is brought into contact with a portion of the<br>
plant, that portion may or may not include the useful plant part intended to be<br>
harvested.	<br>
A composition of the present invention  is used to contact plants. It is<br><br>
contemplated that, in performing the treatment the composition of the present<br><br>
invention may be contacted with the entire plant or may be contacted with one or more plant parts. Plant parts include any part of a plant, including, for example,<br>
flowers, buds, blooms, seeds, cuttings, roots, bulbs, fruits, vegetables, leaves, and combinations thereof.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the liquid composition of the present invention is<br><br>
sprayed onto crop plants growing in a fiend. Such a spraying operation may be performed one time or more than one time on a particular group of crop plants during a single growing season. In some embodiments, the amount of cyclopropene used in<br><br>
one spraying operation is 0.1 gram per he<br>
hectare (g/ha) or more; or 0.5 g/ha or more; <br>

The growth and development process of many crop plants can be described by  certain developmental stages. For example, many crop plants develop through vegetative stages followed by reproductive stages. Some crop plants develop through ripening stages after their reproductive stages. In the practice of the present invention,<br>
crop plants are contacted with a composition of the present invention one or more<br>
times during one or more reproductive stages. In some embodiments, crop plants may<br>
optionally be additionally contacted with a composition of the present invention one or more times prior to any reproductive stage, one or more times during any ripening stage, or a combination thereof.<br>
Some crop plants develop through vegetative and reproductive processes<br><br>
simultaneously. It is contemplated to contact such crop plants with one or more<br><br>
composition of the present invention one or more times after germination but before<br>
harvest.	<br>
It is contemplated that, in some embodiments, contacting horticultural crop<br>
;<br>
plants with a liquid composition of the  present invention will result in improved crop<br>
yield. It is contemplated that, for some specific crop plants, there may be an optimum<br>
stage or stages at which to perform the contact with the composition of the present<br>
invention, in order to achieve the maximum  improvement in crop yield. It is<br>
contemplated that such optimum stage or stages may be different for each type of crop<br>
plant, and such optimum stage or stages may, in some cases, depend on the specific<br>
growing conditions.	<br>
In some embodiments, it is contemplated to contact a group of crop plants at a<br><br>
certain desired stage of development. In such cases, it is contemplated that such<br><br>
contacting may be performed when the ratio of the number of plants that have reached<br><br>
 number of plants in the group is at least<br>
the desired stage of development to the total<br>
0.1, or at least 0.5, or at least 0.75, or at 1east0.9 (i.e., when the portion of plants that<br>
have reached the desired stage of development  is at least 10%, or 50%, or 75%, or<br>
90%).	<br>

In some embodiments of the present invention, a group of plants is treated<br><br>
simultaneously or sequentially. One characteristic of such a group of plants is the crop yield, which is defined as the amount (herein called "crop amount") of useful<br><br>
plant parts collected from a defined group of plants. In one useful definition of the<br><br>
crop yield, the defined group of plants is  the group that occupies a certain area of<br>
ground (this definition is often used when plants are growing in a contiguous group in<br>
a field). Li another useful definition of the crop yield, the defined group of plants is a<br>
specific number of individually identified plants (this definition may be used for any<br>
group of plants, including, for example, plants in fields, in pots, in greenhouses, or<br>
any combination thereof).	<br>
The crop amount may defined in  a variety of ways. In the practice of the<br>
i<br>
present invention, the crop amount may be measured, for example, by any of the<br>
following methods: weight, volume, number of harvested plant parts, or biomass.<br>
Also contemplated are methods in which the crop amount is measured as the amount<br>
in the crop of a specific constituent (such as, for example, solids, sugar, starch, or protein). Further contemplated are methods in which the crop amount is measured as the amount of a certain characteristic (such as, for example, redness, which is sometimes used to measure the amount of a crop of tomatoes). Additionally contemplated are methods in which the drop amount is measured as the amount of a specific portion of the harvested plant part.<br>
In some embodiments, the crop yield is defined as the crop amount per unit of area of land. That is, the land area from Much the crop was harvested is measured, and the crop amount is divided by the land area to calculate the crop yield. For<br><br>
example, a crop amount measured as the weight of harvested plant parts would lead to a crop yield that is reported as a weight per area (for example, kilograms per hectare).<br><br>
It is contemplated that, in some embodiments, the harvested plant parts that contribute to the crop amount are those plant parts that meet the minimum quality<br>
criteria that are appropriate for that type of plant part. That is, when plant parts are harvested from certain plants, the crop amount is,  for example, the weight of the plant parts of acceptable quality that are harvested from those plants. Acceptable quality may be determined by any of the common criteria used by persons who harvest or handle the plant part of interest. Such criteria of acceptable quality of a plant part may<br><br>
be, for example, one or more of size, weight, firmness, resistance to bruising, flavor,<br>
sugar/starch balance, color, beauty, edibility, cosmetic appeal, overall appearance,<br>
suitability for sale, other quality criteria, or any combination thereof. Also<br>
contemplated as a criterion of quality, either alone or in combination with any of the<br>
foregoing criteria, is the time over which the plant part maintains its quality (as judged<br>
by any of the forgoing criteria).	<br>
A few illustrative (but not limiting) examples of crop amount are, for example,<br>
itotal weight of crop harvested; total number of plant parts harvested; weight (or number) of harvested plant parts that each meet or exceed some minimum weight for that type of plant part; or weight (or number) of harvested plant parts that each meet or<br>
exceed some minimum quality criterion  (e.g., color or flavor or texture or other<br>
criterion or combination of criteria) for that type of plant part; weight (or number) of<br>
harvested plant parts that are edible; or weight (or number) of harvested plant parts that are able to be sold. In each case, as  defined herein above, the crop yield is the crop amount per unit area of land on which the crop was grown.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, treatment of a group of plants with the methods of the present invention will increase the crop yield of that group of plants, compared to the crop yield that would have been obtained from that group of plants if it had not been treated with the methods of the present invention. The<br>
increase in crop yield may be obtained hi any of a wide variety of ways. For example,<br>
one way an increase in crop yield may be obtained is that each plant may produce a<br>
greater number of useful plant parts. As to other example, one way an increase in crop yield may be obtained is that each useful plant part may have higher weight. As a third example, crop yield may increase when a larger number of potentially useful plant parts meets the minimum criteria for acceptable quality. Other ways of increasing the crop yield may also result from the practice of the present invention. Also contemplated are increases in crop yield that happen by any combination of ways.<br>
Another contemplated benefit of practicing some embodiments of the present invention is that the general quality of the crop may be improved. That is, a crop produced by methods of the present invention may have a general or average level of quality higher than comparable crops produced without the methods of the present invention, as judged by the quality criteria appropriate for that crop. In some cases, such higher-quality crops may command higher prices when sold.<br>

t<br>
In the following examples, these  procedures were used:<br>
Spray tank was filled with approximately two-thirds of the total volume of<br><br>
water required. The amount of Powder 1 or Powder 2 was weighed according to the intended treatment rate and total volume of spray being prepared The appropriate amount of was calculated to give 0.38% v/v of total spray volume. Adjuvant 1 was added to the spray tank, which was agitated until the mixture turned milky white. Powder 1 or Powder 2 was added to the spray container, which was then gently (not vigorously) agitated. The remaining water was added, making sure all of the powder<br><br>
was wet and washed off of the sides of the tank (if any had deposited there). The spray tank was then swirled or stirred for 2 to 5 minutes to ensure good mixing. Between 5 and 60 minutes thereafter, plants were sprayed with the mixture.<br>
Flat fan nozzles were used, producing droplet size of 100 to 500 micrometers. Spray rate of mixture was 187 to 373 liter per hectare (20 to 40 gallons per acre). Carbon dioxide-powered backpack sprayer was used. Spraying was performed before 10:00 am.<br>
