				<td>LONGITUDINALLY REINFORCED CURED IN PLACE LINER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to cured in place liners for trenchless rehabilitation of<br>
existing conduits and pipelines, and more particularly to a cured in place liner<br>
longitudinally reinforced with a scrim on a surface of a liner in lay flat condition between<br>
the resin impregnable layer and an outer impermeable coating suitable for trenchless<br>
rehabilitation of existing conduits by pulling in and inflating.<br>
[0002] It is generally well known that existing conduits and pipelines, particularly<br>
underground pipes, such as sanitary sewer pipes, storm sewer pipes, water lines and gas<br>
lines that are employed for conducting fluids frequently require repair due to fluid<br>
leakage. The leakage may be inward from the environment into the interior or conducting<br>
portion of the pipelines. Alternatively, the leakage may be outward frorn the conducting<br>
portion of the pipeline into the surrounding environment. In either case of infiltration or<br>
exfultration, it is desirable to avoid this type of leakage.<br>
[0003] The leakage in the existing conduit may be due to improper installation of the<br>
original pipeline, or deterioration of the pipe itself due to normal aging, or the effects of<br>
conveying corrosive or abrasive material. Cracks at, or near pipe joints may be due to<br>
environment conditions such as earthquakes, or the movement of large vehicles on the<br>
overhead surface, or similar natural or man-made vibrations, or other such causes.<br>
Regardless of the cause, such leakages are undesirable and may result in waste of the<br>
fluid being conveyed within the pipeline, or result in damage to the surrounding<br>
environment and possible creation of dangerous public health hazards. If the leakage<br>
continues it can lead to structural failure of the existing conduit due to loss of soil and<br>
side support of the conduit.<br>
[0004] Because of ever increasing labor and machinery costs, it is increasingly more<br>
difficult and less economical to repair underground pipes or portions that may be leaking<br>
by digging up the existing pipe and replacing the pipe with a new one. As a result,<br><br>
various methods have been devised for the in place repair or rehabilitation of existing<br>
pipelines. These new methods avoid the expense and hazards associated with digging up<br>
and replacing the pipe or pipe sections, as well as the significant inconvenience to the<br>
public during construction. One of the most successful pipeline repair or trenchless<br>
rehabilitation processes that is currently in wide use is called the InsituformÂ® Process.<br>
The Insituform Process is described in detail in U.S. Patents No. 4,009,063, No.<br>
4,064,211 and No. 4,135,958, the contents of which are all incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0005] In the standard practice of the Insituform Process an elongated flexible tubular<br>
liner of a felt fabric, foam or similar resin impregnable material with an outer<br>
impermeable coating that has been impregnated with a thermosetting curable resin is<br>
installed within the existing pipeline. In the most widely practiced embodiment of that<br>
process, the liner is installed utilizing an eversion process, as described in the '211 and<br>
'958 Insituform patents. In the eversion process, radial pressure applied to the interior of<br>
an everted liner presses it against and into engagement with the inner surface of the<br>
pipeline as the liner unfolds along the length of the pipeline. The Insituform Process is<br>
also practiced by pulling a resin impregnated liner into the conduit by a rope or cable and<br>
using a separate fluid impermeable inflation bladder or tube that is everted within the<br>
liner to cause the liner to cure against the inner wall of the existing pipeline. Such resin<br>
impregnated liners are generally referred to as "cured-in-place-pipes" or "CIPP liners"<br>
and the installation is referred to a CIPP installation.<br>
[0006] Conventional cured in place flexible tubular liners for both the eversion and<br>
pull-in-and-inflate CIPP installations have an outer smooth layer of relatively flexible,<br>
substantially impermeable polymer coating in its initial state. The outer coating allows a<br>
resin to be impregnated into the inner layer of resin impregnable material, such as felt.<br>
When everted, this impermeable layer ends up on the inside of the liner with the resin<br>
impregnated layer against the wall of the existing pipeline. As the flexible liner is<br>
installed in place within the pipeline, the pipeline is pressurized from within, preferably<br>
utilizing an eversion fluid, such as water or air to force the liner radially outwardly to<br>
engage and conform to the interior surface of the existing pipeline. Cure of the resin is<br><br>
initiated by introduction of hot curing fluid, such as water into the everted liner through a<br>
recirculation hose attached to the end of the everting liner. The resin impregnated into the<br>
impregnable material then cures to form a hard, tight fitting rigid pipe lining within the<br>
existing pipeline. The new liner effectively seals any cracks and repairs any pipe section<br>
or pipe joint deterioration in order to prevent further leakage either into or out of the<br>
existing pipeline. The cured resin also serves to strengthen the existing pipeline wall so<br>
as to provide added structural support for the surrounding environment.<br>
[0007] When tubular cured in place liners are installed by the pull-in-and-inflate<br>
method, the liner is impregnated with resin in the same manner as in the eversion process<br>
and pulled into and positioned within the existing pipeline in a collapsed state. In a<br>
typical installation, a downtube, inflation pipe or conduit having an elbow at the lower<br>
end is positioned within an existing manhole or access point and an everting bladder is<br>
passed through the downtube, opened up and cuffed back over the mouth of the<br>
horizontal portion of the elbow and inserted into the collapsed liner. The collapsed liner<br>
within the existing conduit is then positioned over and secured to the cuffed back end of<br>
the inflation bladder. An everting fluid, such as water, is then fed into the downtube and<br>
the water pressure causes the inflation bladder to push out of the horizontal portion of the<br>
elbow and cause the collapsed liner to expand against the interior surface of the existing<br>
conduit. The eversion of the inflation bladder continues until the bladder reaches and<br>
extends into the downstream manhole or second access point. At this time the liner<br>
pressed against the interior surface of the existing conduit is allow to cure. Cure is<br>
initiated by introduction of hot curing water introduced into the inflation bladder in much<br>
the same manner as the recirculation line tied to the end of the everting bladder to cause<br>
the resin in the impregnated layer to cure.<br>
[0008] After the resin in the liner cures, the inflation bladder may be removed or left<br>
in place in the cured liner. Both the pull-in and inflate method as well as the eversion<br>
method typically require man-access to restricted manhole space on several occasions<br>
during the process. For example, man-access is required to secure the everting liner or<br>
bladder to the end of the elbow and insert it into the collapsed liner.<br><br>
[0009] Regardless of how the liner is to be installed a curable thermosetting resin is<br>
impregnated into the resin absorbent layers of a liner by a process referred to as "wet-<br>
out." The wet-out process generally involves injecting resin into resin absorbent layers<br>
through an end or an opening formed in the outer impermeable film, drawing a vacuum<br>
and passing the impregnated liner through nip rollers as is well known in the lining art. A<br>
wide variety of resins may be used, such as polyester, vinyl esters, epoxy resins and the<br>
like, which may be modified as desired. It is preferable to utilize a resin which is<br>
relatively stable at room temperature, but which cures readily when heated with air, steam<br>
or hot water, or subjected to appropriate radiation, such as ultra-violet light.<br>
[0010] One such procedure for wetting out a liner by vacuum impregnation is<br>
described in Insituform U.S. Patent No. 4,366,012. When the liner has inner and outer<br>
impermeable layers, the tubular liner may be supplied flat and slits formed on opposite<br>
sides of the flattened liner and resin injected and on both sides as described in the '063<br>
Patent. Another apparatus for wetting out at the time of installation while drawing a<br>
vacuum at the trailing end of the liner is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,182,262. The<br>
contents of each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0011] Recent efforts have been made to modify the pull-in and inflate method to<br>
utilize air to evert a bladder into the pulled-in liner from a proximal access point. When<br>
the everting bladder reaches the distal access point, steam is introduced into the proximal<br>
access point to initiate cure of the resin impregnated layer. This process offers the<br>
advantage of faster cure due to the increased energy carried by the steam as the curing<br>
fluid. However, the process still requires eversion of a bladder into the pulled-in<br>
impregnated liner. Efforts to avoid this step of everting the bladder into the pulled-in<br>
liner include performing the eversion step above ground. For example, in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,270,289, the process includes everting a calibration hose into a flat-lying lining hose<br>
above ground prior to pulling the hose assembly into the existing conduit. This process<br>
avoids the eversion below grade, but is severely limited into the length of lining that can<br>
be laid out above ground prior to pulling-in.<br>
[0012] A further suggestion to avoid this eversion is to manufacture a liner having an<br>
inner coating and an outer coating so that a curing fluid can be introduced directly into a<br><br>
pulled-in liner. The disadvantages here involves the difficulty faced when trying to<br>
impregnate the resin impregnable material disposed between the inner and outer<br>
impermeable coatings. The outer coating remains essential for handling the impregnated<br>
liner and to allow the liner to be pulled into the existing conduit and the inner coating is<br>
desired to all for curing with the steam.<br>
[0013] A typical 8 inch diameter 6 mm thick liner weighs about 7.5 ounces per foot<br>
prior to wet out. About 3 pounds of resin per foot are impregnated, resulting in almost a<br>
seven fold increase in weight to about 3.5 pounds per foot. In this case, a 200 foot length<br>
of liner subject to a load of 350 pounds stretches about 3 percent in length. At 5000<br>
pounds of load the 8 inch liner will stretch as much as 35 to 40 percent. Thus, a typical<br>
300 foot liner between manholes may stretch as much as 30 feet. The increase in weight<br>
of the liner for larger diameter liners makes the load required for pull-in even more<br>
staggering. Thus, there are significant limitations on the lengths of liner that can be<br>
pulled in. The same is true to a greater extent for larger diameter liners.<br>
[0014] One solution to tin's problem involves addition of a layer of reinforcing fibers<br>
into the liner. For example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,868,169 a web or mesh of reinforcing<br>
fibers is stitched or flame bonded to one of the resin absorbent layers of the liner. The<br>
webs disclosed are in a graphical or grid pattern, include longitudinal fiber held together<br>
by radial fibers, cross-hatched or a cross-hatched web with randomly oriented fibers.<br>
[0015] While these suggestions to increase longitudinal strength are available, there<br>
are difficulties in handling webs and attaching them to one of the resin absorbent layers as<br>
a heavy web tends to hinder impregnation and reduce the circumferential stretch need for<br>
CIPP installation. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a longitudinally reinforced liner<br>
that can be easily manufactured and avoid the difficulties faced in the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention, a longitudinally<br>
reinforced resin impregnated cured in place liner suitable for pull-in and inflate<br>
rehabilitation of existing pipelines is provided. The liner may be continuously formed<br>
from a length of a resin absorbent material having an impermeable layer bonded to one<br><br>
surface formed into a tubular shape and sealed with the impermeable layer on the inside<br>
of the tube. The tube may be wrapped with additional layers of resin absorbent material<br>
in tubular form and impregnated with a thermosetting resin. Prior to final placement of<br>
the outer coating, a scrim having greater strength in the warp direction is applied to a<br>
surface of the flattened impregnated tube. Generally, the scrim will be applied in a width<br>
to cover about one-quarter to one-half of the tube circumference and is applied to the<br>
flattened bottom surface. An outer impermeable layer maybe applied to the tube by<br>
everting a tube of impermeable material onto the inner tubular member as the tube and<br>
scrim are fed into a tubular stuffing device, or by wrapping and sealing continuously with<br>
an impermeable film.<br>
[0017] The scrim provides longitudinal reinforcement and is positioned at the bottom<br>
half of the liner and acts as a pull-in sled. This increase in longitudinal strength allows<br>
for pulling-in of long lengths of liner, and substantially reduces stretch of the resin<br>
impregnated liner during pull-in.<br>
[0018] Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved<br>
longitudinally reinforced cured-in-place liner having an inner impermeable coating.<br>
[0019] Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method for<br>
manufacturing a longitudinally reinforced liner having an inner impermeable coating.<br>
[0020] Another object of the invention is to add a scrim during the manufacture of a<br>
CEPP tube that will limit longitudinal stretch without reducing circumference stretch.<br>
[0021] A further object of the invention is to provide an improved method of<br>
manufacture of a longitudinally reinforced cured in place liner by disposing a sheet of<br>
scrim on a portion of the outer layer of resin absorbent material before an impermeable<br>
wrapping is everted about the inner tubular layer of resin absorbent material and scrim.<br>
[0022] Yet another object of the invention is provide an improved method of<br>
continuously manufacturing a longitudinally reinforced resin impregnated cured in place<br>
liner having an inner and outer impermeable layer.<br><br>
[0023] Still another object of the invention is to provide a method of applying a<br>
longitudinal reinforcement to a CTPP tube after the impregnable layer is wet-out with<br>
resin.<br>
[0024] Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a<br>
cured in place liner having inner and outer impermeable layers for pull-in and inflate<br>
trenchless pipeline installation.<br>
[0025] Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will<br>
in part be apparent from the specification.<br>
[0026] The invention accordingly comprises the several steps and the relation of one or<br>
more of such steps with respect to each of the others, the apparatuses embodying features of<br>
construction, combinations and arrangement of parts that are adapted to effect such steps,<br>
and the products that possess the characteristics, features, properties, and the relation of<br>
components, which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the<br>
invention will be indicated in the claims.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0037] A resin impregnated cured in place liner prepared in accordance with the<br>
invention has a longitudinal reinforcing scrim so that is can be installed by the pull-in-<br>
and-inflate method. When prepared with an integral internal impermeable layer it may be<br>
inflated and cured with a heated fluid without the use of an inflation bladder. A liner with<br>
inner impermeable layer and longitudinal reinforcement is prepared in continuous<br>
lengths. It may be impregnated as it is assembled in view of the increased effort<br>
necessary to impregnate a flattened liner having a resin absorbent material between an<br>
inner and an outer coating using convention vacuum impregnation technology.<br>
[0038] FIG. 1 illustrates a flexible cured in place liner 11 of the type generally in use<br>
today and well known in the art. Liner 11 is formed from at least one layer of a flexible<br>
resin impregnable material, such as a felt layer 12 having an outer impermeable polymer<br>
film layer 13. Felt layer 12 and outer polymer layer 13 are stitched along a seam line 14<br>
to form a tubular liner. A compatible thermoplastic film in a form of a tape or extruded<br>
material 16 is placed on or extruded over seam line 14 in order to ensure the<br><br>
impermeability of liner 11. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 and used throughout<br>
this description, liner 11 includes an inner tube of a second felt layer 17 also stitched<br>
along a seam line 18 positioned at a point in the tube other than the location of seam line<br>
14 in outer felt layer 12. Outer felt layer 12 with polymer layer 13 is then formed around<br>
inner tubular layer 17. After impregnation liner 11 in a continuous length is stored in a<br>
refrigeration unit to suppress premature cure of the resin. Liner 11 is then cut to a desired<br>
length after being pulled into the existing pipeline, or is cut prior to being everted into the<br>
existing pipeline.<br>
[0039] Liner 11 of the type illustrated in FIG. 1 is impermeable to water and air. This<br>
will allow use in an air or water eversion as described above. However, in a pull in and<br>
inflate installation in accordance with the invention, the outer coating on the liner need<br>
only be sufficiently impermeable to allow for easy handling wet-out and retention of resin<br>
and to prevent damage to the liner as it is pulled into the existing pipeline.<br>
[0040] For larger liner diameters, several layers of felt or resin impregnable material<br>
may be used. Felt layers 12 and 17 may be natural or synthetic flexible resin absorbable<br>
material, such as polyester, acrylic polypropylene, or inorganic fibers such as glass and<br>
carbon. Alternatively, the resin absorbent material may be a foam. Impermeable film 13<br>
on outer impregnable layer 12 may be a polyolefm, such as polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene, a vinyl polymer, such as polyvinyl chloride, or a polyurethane as is well<br>
known in the art. Any form of sewing, adhesive bonding or flame bonding, or any other<br>
convenient means can be used to join the material into tubes. In the initial step in all<br>
trenchless rehabilitation installations, the existing pipeline is prepared by cleaning and<br>
videotaping.<br>
[0041] Referring now to FIG. 2, a longitudinally reinforced cured in place liner 21<br>
prepared in accordance with the invention is shown in cross-section. Liner 21 is<br>
constructed in similar fashion to convention liner 11, but includes an inner impermeable<br>
layer 22 that has a thin felt or resin impregnable layer 23 bonded thereto. Inner felt layer<br>
23 and impermeable layer 22 have been sewn along a seam line 24 by a row of stitches 26<br>
and sealed with a tape 27 applied over stitches 26. An outer felt layer 28 is wrapped<br>
about inner thin felt layer 23 and formed into a tube by stitches 29. A longitudinal<br><br>
reinforcing scrim 33 is disposed on the bottom of outer felt layer 28. Finally, an outer<br>
layer or wrapping 31 is formed into a tube with an edge seal 32 and continuously everted<br>
over outer felt layer 28 so that an edge seal 32 is encapsulated under outer impermeable<br>
layer 31 as will be described in more detail below.<br>
[0042] By manufacturing a liner in this manner, it is not necessary to evert the liner<br>
during installation or evert an inflation bladder after the liner has been pulled into the<br>
existing conduit. Longitudinal reinforcement of scrim 33 allows pulling-in of longer<br>
length while avoiding stretch and inherent thinning of liner wall.<br>
[0043] Felt layers 23 and 28 may be impregnated in the usual manner using vacuum.<br>
Alternatively, felt layers 23 and 28 are first impregnated with resin, scrim 33 is applied<br>
and then outer impermeable coating 31 is applied. This avoids the difficulty with<br>
impregnating a finished liner having a reinforcing scrim and felt layers between an inner<br>
and outer impregnable layer. Liner 21 is manufactured from endless rolls of flat coated<br>
felt and plain felt and continuously impregnated prior to mating with scrim 33 and<br>
application of outer wrapping 31. This may be accomplished by the method using the<br>
apparatuses illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5 resulting in a liner 21 and 74 as illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 2 and 7.<br>
[0044] While felt layers 23 and 28 are formed into tubes by stitching and/or taping,<br>
any of the conventionally blown methods for forming felt or other resin impregnable<br>
material into tubes is suitable. For example, tubes can be formed by use of various glues<br>
or adhesives as well as flame bonding. Tape may be applied to inner felt layer 23 and<br>
inner impermeable layer 22 by applying an adhesive strip or extruding a layer of<br>
polymeric material in order to seal the butted edges of the felt material and the holes<br>
formed in layer 22 during a sewing operation.<br>
[0045] Referring now to FIG. 3, a method for continuously forming a length of a tube<br>
or resin impregnable material with a sealed inner impermeable layer is shown. A roll of<br>
coated felt 36 having a continuous length of felt 37 with an impermeable layer 38 is fed<br>
over a directional roller 39 in flat form with coated side facing roller 39 to a tube forming<br>
device 41.<br><br>
[0046] Tube forming device 41 includes a tubular support frame 42 having a proximal<br>
end 42a and a distal end 42b and a film deformer 40. A seaming device 43 that may be a<br>
sewing and taping machine, gluing machine or flame bonding apparatus is mounted<br>
above support frame 42. Felt 37 with impermeable layer 38 facing roller 39 is fed in the<br>
direction of an arrow A to the proximal end of tube forming device 41 where it is<br>
deflected by deflector 40 and wrapped around support frame 42 and seamed into a tube<br>
44	along a seam line 46 with felt 37 on the inside and impermeable layer 38 on the<br>
outside. Tube 44 then passes a taping device 47 where a tape 48 is placed over seam line<br>
46 to form an impermeable coated taped tube member 45.<br>
[0047] Taped tube member 45 then continues to travel along tubular support frame 42<br>
to an inverter ring 49 at the distal end of support frame 42. Taped tube 45 is then everted<br>
into tubular support frame 42 so that impermeable la}rer 38 is now on the inside of tube<br>
45	as it is withdrawn from the proximal end of tubular support frame 42 along a line<br>
defined by an arrow B. At this point everted tube 45 has the structure illustrated in cross-<br>
section in FIG. 4 with impermeable layer 38 on the inside and felt layer 37 on the outside.<br>
Tube 45 is then stored for further use or may be passed directly to a resin impregnation<br>
step and reinforcement as shown in FIG. 5 prior to final wrapping.<br>
[0048] FIG. 5 illustrates in schematic impregnation of a supply 51 of taped tube 45.<br>
Here, tube 45 is pulled in a direction indicated by arrow C by a pair of rubber covered<br>
pulling rollers 52 and 53 into an open top resin tower 54. Resin tower 54 is filled to a<br>
predetermined level with a curable thermoset resin 57 to form an impregnated or wet-out<br>
tube 55. Tube 45 passes over roller 53 and down the full height of tower 54 to a bottom<br>
roller 59 that rums tube 45 in an upward direction to a pair of calibration rollers 61 and<br>
62. Tower 54 is between about six to fourteen feet in height, but can be any height<br>
sufficient to provide a pressure head sufficient to wet out and impregnate the outer<br>
impregnable layer of tube 45. The height necessary to provide sufficient head to<br>
impregnate the impregnable material is dependent on the viscosity of the resin, the<br>
thickness of the impregnable material and the speed through the tower.<br>
[0049] At this time, impregnated tube 55 exiting tower 54 in the direction of an arrow<br>
D is ready for adding the reinforcing scrim and final wrapping with an outer impermeable<br><br>
coating. Also shown in FIG. 5 adjacent to tower 54 is a scrim supply 50 and a wrapping<br>
and sealing station 63. Scrim supply 50 includes a roll 75 of longitudinal reinforcing<br>
scrim 76. Scrim 76 is fed up over a tension bar or roller 77 and into contact with the<br>
lower portion of wetout tube 55. Scrim 76 is kept at a sufficient tension as it passes over<br>
tension bar 77 prior to contact with wet out tube 55 to avoid any slack and to achieve<br>
effective reinforcement. Resin impregnated tube 55 and scrim 76 are then pulled along in<br>
a direction indicated by an arrow D' into former pipe 64 of film wrapping and sealing<br>
station 63 and tube 72 of impermeable material is everted onto impregnated tube 55 and<br>
scrim 76 to form a wrapped tube 74 having impermeable outer wrapping 72 with an edge<br>
seal 73 as shown in cross-section in FIG. 7. Wrapped tube 74 is pulled by a pair of final<br>
pulling rollers 79 and 81 and fed along an arrow F to a refrigerated truck for shipment to<br>
an installation site.<br>
[0050] Film wrapping and sealing station 63 shown in FIG. 5 includes a former pipe<br>
64 having an inlet end 64a and an outlet end 64b and an edge sealer 65 positioned above<br>
the mid-section of former pipe 64. A roll 66 of a resin impermeable film material 67 that<br>
is to be wrapped about impregnated tube 55 as it is fed in a direction indicated by an<br>
arrow D' into former pipe 64. Resin impermeable film material 67 is fed from roll 66<br>
about a series of direction rollers 68a - e and pulled by a pair of drive rollers 69a and 69b<br>
as film 67 is fed over rollers 70a - d to former pipe 64. A deflector 71 and onto former<br>
pipe 64 prior to being fed into edge sealer 65 to form film 67 into a tube 72 with an edge<br>
seal 73 extending outwardly therefrom. Tube 72 of impermeable material moving along<br>
former pipe 64 is pulled in a direction indicated by an arrow E to inlet end 64a of former<br>
pipe 64 whereupon tube 72 is continuously everted into the interior of former pipe 64 and<br>
onto impregnated tube 55 and scrim 76 and pulled in the opposite direction indicated by a<br>
dashed arrow F.<br>
[0051] Referring to FIG. 6, a cross-sectional view through sealer 65 and former pipe<br>
64 along line 6-6 in FIG. 6 is shown. Sealer 65 forms edge seal 73 in film tube 72 as film<br>
tube 72 passes over the outside of former pipe 64. Once tube 72 is everted, edge seal 73<br>
is now inside wrapped wet-out tube 74 as it is pulled from outlet end 64b of forming pipe<br>
68. Outer impermeable film 72 may be applied prior to or after wet-out. In the case<br><br>
where this is prior to wet out, tube 45 prepared as shown in FIG. 3 is fed directly to tube<br>
forming assembly in FIG. 5 and provides liner 74 shown in cross-section in FIG. 7.<br>
[0052] FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative apparatus for wrapping an outer impermeable<br>
tube 81 about impregnated tube 55 is shown generally as 82. Here tube 55 may be<br>
impregnated in the same manner as described in connection with tower 57 as shown in<br>
FIG. 5, or into an open resin tank with compression rollers. Tube 55 is then fed in a<br>
direction of arrow D' into a stuffer pipe 83 having an inlet end 83a and an outlet end 83b.<br>
Reference numerals as used in FIG. 5 are applied to identical elements here.<br>
[0053] A supply of a flexible impermeable tube 81 is loaded onto the outside surface<br>
of stuffer pipe 83 having an inlet end 83a and an outlet end 83b. Impregnated tube 55<br>
leaving resin tank 53 is fed into inlet end 83a of stuffer pipe 83. As tube 55 enters inlet<br>
end 83a of stuffer pipe 83, impermeable tube 81 is pulled off the outside of stuffer pipe 83<br>
and everted about inlet end 83a into the inside of stuffer pipe 83 to envelope impregnated<br>
tube 55 as it leaves outlet end 83b. This forms a complete liner 86 having inner<br>
impermeable layer 38 and outer impermeable coating 81. Tube 86 with outer coating 81<br>
is removed from outlet end 83b of stuffer tube 83 by a pair of drive rollers 87 and 88, or<br>
other pulling device such as tractors, in a direction of an arrow F. When an extruded tube<br>
is used in this embodiment, there is no seam in outer impermeable coating 81. The sole<br>
limitation of preparing tube 86 in this manner is the length of impermeable tube 81 that<br>
can be placed on stuffer tube 83. It has been found that about 1,000 feet of an<br>
impermeable tube can be compressed onto a stuffer tube of about 20 feet in length.<br>
Longer lengths can be stored on longer stuffer tubes.<br>
[0054] FIG. 9 is cross-section of finished CIPP liner 86 as it exits stuffer tube 83.<br>
Liner 86 includes inner tubular member of resin absorbent material 37 having an<br>
impermeable inner coating 38 sealed with a tape 48 as described in connection with FIG.<br>
3. After exiting stuffer tube 83, liner 86 includes outer tubular wrapping 81. In view of<br>
the fact that tubular wrapping 81 is a previously extruded tube, outer wrapping 81 does<br>
not have any seams as liner 21 in FIG. 2 or liner 74 in FIG. 7.<br><br>
[0055] Once at the installation site, reinforced and wrapped impregnated tube 74 or 86<br>
having inner impermeable layer 38 and outer unpermeable wrapping 67 or 81 is ready for<br>
installation by the pull-in-and-inflate method. This method is fully described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,009,063, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the<br>
case of installation by the pull-in-and-inflate method, a separate eversion bladder is not<br>
necessary to inflate the liner due to the presence of inner impermeable layer 38. By<br>
proper selection of materials for inner impermeable layer 38, such as polypropylene,<br>
curing can be done with steam introduced into the liner 74 once in position in the existing<br>
conduit.<br>
[0056] As can be readily seen, there is provided a convenient method of increasing the<br>
longitudinal strength of a flexible cured in place liner having inner and outer impermeable<br>
layers. By placing a scrim having greater strength in the warp direction on the bottom of<br>
the lay flat liner, a flexible cured in place liner of increased potential longitudinal strength<br>
is obtained. This allows for pulling in long lengths of liners or liners of substantially<br>
larger than the 8 inches typically utilized for main lines and conventional sanitary sewers<br>
without experiencing unwanted stretch of the liner. The reinforcing scrim can be formed<br>
of any high-strength low-elongation fibers, such as glass, polyester, polyethylene,<br>
fibulated polypropylene, nylon, carbon, Aramid and even steel. The scrim may be woven<br>
or non-woven, but preferably is woven. It can be formed of any continuous, flexible,<br>
high strength and low elongation fabrics or films, since they will not affect the<br>
impregnation process and circumferential expansion of the finished liner. The ease of<br>
fabrication allows for the continuous assembly of the longitudinally reinforced liner from<br>
plain felt supplies in a continuous manner by the apparatus disclosed.<br>
[0057] The tube prepared in accordance with the process described in connection with<br>
FIG. 3 is then readily impregnated in an open top resin tower and enveloped with the<br>
reinforcing scrim within an impermeable wrapping as described in connection with the<br>
apparatus shown in FIG. 5. The smooth outer surface renders the liner ready for pull-in-<br>
and-inflate installation.<br>
[0058] It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent<br>
from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be<br><br>
made in carrying out the above process, in the described product, and in the construction(s)<br>
set forth without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, it is intended that all<br>
matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawing(s) shall<br>
be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>
[0059] It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of<br>
the generic and specific features of the invention herein described and all statements of the<br>
