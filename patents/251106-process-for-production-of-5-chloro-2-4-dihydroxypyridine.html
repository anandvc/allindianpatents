Process for Production of 5-Chloro-2,4-Dihydroxypyridine<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, which is useful as an inhibitor of a biodegradation enzyme that biodegrades an anti-malignant-tumor agent 5-fluorouracil exhibiting an excellent anti-tumor effect, and to a pyrone derivative, which is a production intermediate. Background Art [0002]<br>
5-Chloro-2 , 4-dihydroxypyridine  (non-proprietary name: Gimeracil) is known to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (an anti-malignant-tumor agent) by inhibiting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is a biodegradation enzyme which acts on 5-fluorouracil (see Patent Document 1) . As a commercial product, a 5-fluorouracil-based anti-tumor agent, which is a combination drug of Gimeracil, Tegafur, and Oteracil Potassium, is available on the market as TS-1 (trade name).<br>
Hitherto, the following 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine production processes are known.  Note that,  in the following schemes, symbols "Ac" and "Et" denote an acetyl group and an ethyl group, respectively.<br>
A process disclosed in Non-Patent Document 1 includes a step performed under very severe conditions  (i.e., under acidic conditions, in an autoclave at 200°C), which makes the process industrially unsuitable.<br>
[0003]<br>
[F1]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0004]<br>
A process disclosed in Non-Patent Document 2 includes a large number of steps, which make the process difficult to carry out on an industrial scale.<br>
[0005]<br>
[F2]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0006]<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses a process in which an a, ß-unsaturated keto ester derivative is synthesized from malonyl dichloride, and ammonia is reacted with the ester derivative, to thereby produce 2,4-dihydroxy-5-halogenopyridine derivative.  In this process, handling of starting materials for producing the a, ß-unsaturated keto ester derivative serving as an intermediate is problematic, and there are some problems associated with reaction conditions.  For the above reasons the process is difficult to be employed on an industrial scale.<br>
[0007]<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
[0008]<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses a process in which the 5-position of 3-cyano-2-hydroxy-3-methoxypiridine is selectively halogenized, and the cyano group is removed through hydrolysis/decarbonation by use of strong acid with heating, to thereby produce 2,4-dihydroxy-5-halogenopyridine derivative.  In this method, a large amount of strong acid is employed for hydrolysis, and a large amount of base is<br>
employed for neutralizing the strong acid. As a result, a large amount of salts are formed as industrial wastes, which are not preferred from the viewpoint of the environment.<br>

[0033]<br>
In step (b) , the 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (1), which is a final product of the reaction, is synthesized. The pyrone derivative represented by formula (4) is treated with acid, and then reacted with ammonia in an excessive amount, to hereby allow ring transformation reaction to proceed.<br>

[0042] Example 4 Synthesis of 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine<br>
Xylene (8 mL) was added to 2,2-cyclohexyl-5-chloro-l,3-dioxin-4-one (0.81 g, 0.004 mol), produced in Referential Example 2, and ketene diethyl ether (0.56 g, 0.0048 mol), and the mixture was refluxed under nitrogen for 20 minutes.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and concentrated, to thereby yield 0.92 g of 5-chloro-2,2-diethoxy-2,3-dihydropyran-4-one as a concentration residue. The residue was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) , and acetyl chloride (0.5 mL) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at room temperature for one hour.  The reaction mixture was concentrated, and ethanol  (10 mL) was added to the residue.  The mixture was concentrated again, and the residue was dissolved in ethanol (1.4 mL) .  Concentrated aqueous ammonia (28%)  (0.5 mL) was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The precipitated crystals were collected through filtration, washed with ethanol, and dissolved in water (5 mL) .  To the solution, acetic acid (0.5 mL) was added, followed by<br>
stirring at room temperature for two hours.  The precipitated crystals were collected through filtration, washed with water,<br>
and dried under reduced pressure at 40 to 50°C for 18 hours, to thereby yield 0.31 g of the title compound (yield with respect to 2,2-cyclohexyl-5-chloro-l,3-dioxin-4-one: 53.3%). [0043] Example 5 Synthesis of 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine<br>
Xylene (40 mL) was added to 2,2-cyclohexyl-5-chloro-1,3-dioxin-4-one (4.25 g, 0.021 mol), produced in Referential Example 2, and ketene diethyl ether (2.91 g, 0.025 mol), and the mixture was stirred under heating at 128 to 130°C (internal temperature) for 40 minutes.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in ethanol (60 mL) , and at room temperature, acetyl chloride (0.17 g, 0.0022 mol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring for one hour.  To the reaction mixture, concentrated ammonia (28%)  (4.2 mL) was added, followed by stirring at room temperature for four hours. A 30% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (3 g, 0.0225 mol) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by stirring at room temperature for 12 hours.  The precipitated crystals were collected through filtration, washed with ethanol (10 mL, two times), and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature for five hours, to thereby yield 3.04 g of a product as crystals.  The thus-obtained crystals were dissolved in water (30 mL) under heating, and the solution<br>
was cooled to room temperature.  6N Aqueous hydrochloric acid (4.5 g) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at room temperature for five hours.  The precipitated crystals were collected through filtration, washed with water, and<br>
dried under reduced pressure at 40 to 45°C for 18 hours, to thereby yield 2.21 g of the title compound (yield with respect to 2,2-cyclohexyl-5-chloro-l,3-dioxin-4-one: 72.4%).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.        A process for producing a 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine represented by formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
characterized in that the process comprises reacting a 5-chloro-l, 3-dioxin-4-one compound (2) represented by formula (2):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(wherein R1 and R2, which are identical to or different from each other, each represent a C1 to C6 linear-chain or branched-chain alkyl group, or R1 and R2 may be linked to form a C3 to C6 cycloalkane with adjacent carbon atoms) with a ketene acetal compound (3) represented by formula (3):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(wherein R3 and R4, which are identical to or different form each other, each present a C1 to C6 linear-chain or branched-chain alkyl group, or a silyl group having a C1 to C6 linear-chain or<br>
branched-chain alkyl group), wherein the ketene acetal compound (3) is employed 0.7 to 5 equivalent weight with respect to the 5-chloro-l,3-dioxin-4-one compound (2), at the reaction temperature of 50° to 150° C for 5 to 120 minutes, to thereby form a pyrone compound (4) represented by formula (4):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(wherein R3 and R4 have the same meanings as defined above):<br>
treating the pyrone compound (4) with an acid; wherein the acid is employed in an amount of<br>
0.01 to 10 equivalent weight with respect to the pyrone compound (4), at the reaction temperature<br>
of 0 °C to 100°C for 5 to 120 minutes;<br>
and subsequently, reacting the product with ammonia wherein the ammonia is employed in an<br>
amount of 1 to 30 equivalent weight with respect to the pyrone compound (4), at the reaction<br>
temperature of 0° C to 100°C for 0.5 to 24 hours.</td>
