SUPPORT RING FOR ACCOMMODATING A PLATE-LIKE<br>
ELEMENT IN A VESSEL<br>
OUTOTEC OYJ<br>
a company incorporated in Finland<br>
of Riihitontuntie 7, FIN - 02200, Espoo Finland<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br>
This invention relates to a support ring for accommodating a plate-like element in a vessel, in particular a tray or separating plate in a converter for producing S03 from S02-containing gas, wherein the plate-like element rests on a bracket attached to the wall of the vessel.<br>
In the converter of a sulphuric-acid plant, sulfur dioxide (S02) is converted to sulfur trioxide (S03) by means of a catalyst. The gas containing sulfur dioxide is introduced into the converter together with oxygen, guided through a plurality of contact stages or trays of the converter arranged one after the other, and at least partly converted to sulfur trioxide by catalytic oxidation. The reaction of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide is strongly exothermal, so that heat exchangers are provided between the individual contact stages, in order to dissipate the heat produced. To achieve a compact construction, one or more heat exchangers often are formed inside the converter, and the contact trays are arranged annularly around the central tube accommodating the heat exchangers. The construction and operation of a converter is described for instance in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th edition, vol. A25, pages 649 to 653.<br>
The individual contact stages of the converter are separated from each other by separating plates. In the contact stages, the catalyst usually containing vanadium pentoxide as active component is arranged on so-called trays. Converters for producing sulfur trioxide usually are very large for economic reasons. For instance, the vessel can have a diameter of 15 m. With a diameter of the central tube of 7 m, an annular width of 4 m thus is obtained for the trays carrying the catalyst. It is quite obvious that due the weight of the catalyst, the pressure loss of the process gas and the high temperatures existing in the converter a high load is exerted on the trays, which leads to a plastic deformation. In general, it is assumed for instance in the case of austenitic steel that an elongation of about 30% leads to rupture. To avoid an excessive deflection and rupture of the trays, stiffening is required. For this purpose, a grid structure usually is incorporated in the converter, on which the trays configured as perforated plates are disposed, which are traversed by the process gas. Due to the high temperature caused by the exothermal reaction, which for instance in the first contact stage is about 625°C, it is necessary to use expensive stainless steels for the trays carrying the catalyst and the separating plates between the contact stages. Since the grid structure must also be made of stainless steel because of the high temperatures and must have a sufficient thickness to bear the catalyst weight, high weights and hence costs are obtained for these boiler inserts.<br>
It is the object of the invention to optimize the consumption of material for manufacturing a sulphuric acid converter.<br>
This object substantially is solved with the invention in that the bracket has an upper supporting surface which is inclined downwards with respect to the horizontal.<br>
When the tray now is loaded and deflected by the applied catalyst and by the pressure loss of the process gas, this leads to a plastic deformation of the tray. But before the deforming tray reaches the allowed elongation limit of about 15 times the elastic elongation, the plastic deformation of the tray is limited by abutting against the support. At the end of this supporting range, a deformation of the sheet starting at zero can possibly be initiated again. By a corresponding inclination of the bracket a defined transition from the bending stress to a mere tensile stress can be achieved in addition, for which tensile stress distinctly higher load limit values do exist. The invention thus allows a restricted plasticity of the supported tray (plastic hinge), in order to selectively convert the bending stress into a tensile membrane stress.<br>
If, as is common practice in conventional converters, the plate-like element constitutes a circular ring which on its inside rests on a second bracket, the upper supporting surface of the second bracket also is inclined downwards with respect to the horizontal in accordance with an aspect of the invention. The tray thus can equally be held on both sides.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, the upper supporting surface is curved downwards. By a corresponding selection of the curvature, it is possible, so to speak, to "follow" the physical line of the plastic deformation of the sheet, in order to achieve a maximum admissible elongation.<br>
In accordance with a particularly preferred aspect of the invention, the upper supporting surface has at least two successive radii of different magnitude. As a result, a smooth transition between the individual regions of curvature can be achieved, wherein an edge which might potentially cause a rupture of the plate-like element is avoided at the transition between the radii.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the magnitude of the radii is decreasing proceeding from the radius closest to the wall of the vessel to the radii located further away (Rl &gt; R2 &gt; ... &gt; Ri &gt; ... Rn). When using two radii, the first radius located close to the wall of the Vessel can define the bend of the platelike element, whereas the second radius, which is further away from the wall and smaller, serves the detachment of the plate from the bracket.<br>
In a converter of the usual size, the radius closest to the wall of the vessel lies in the range from 500 to 900 mm, preferably 600 to 800 mm, and in particular is about 700 mm in accordance with the invention. The radius succeeding the radius closest to the wall of the vessel lies in the range from 300 to 700 mm, preferably 400 to 600 mm, and in particular is about 500 mm in accordance with the invention. These values should of course be adapted to the size of the vessel accommodating the plate-like element.<br>
It is of course also possible to adapt the bedding of the elastic deformation to the physical/mechanical bend of the plate-like element. Instead of adapting the radii, this can for instance also be effected by using a curve geometry, such as cycloids.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the upper supporting surface of the bracket is inclined downwards. In particular when no very high loads act on the plate-like element, for instance in the case of the separating plates in the converter, gradually supporting the deflecting plate by a plurality of adjoining regions of different curvature can be omitted and merely one straight supporting surface can be provided. In this way, the manufacturing costs for the bracket can further be reduced. In this case, the angle of inclination of the upper supporting surface preferably is about 4 to 9°, in particular about 6 to 7°, in order to achieve a defined transition from the bending stress of the deflecting plate to a mere tensile stress.<br>
If for instance in the case of separating plates of a converter a load acts on the sheet from below due to the gas pressure, the sheet can rest against the bracket from below in an alternative aspect of the invention and said bracket can have a lower contact surface which is inclined upwards with respect to the horizontal. The configuration of this contact surface is effected similar to the configuration of the contact surface described above. As a result, the supporting/contact surface recedes in the direction of the force exerted on the sheet in both embodiments, in order to allow a plastic deformation of the sheet.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a uniform support of the plate-like element on the wall of the vessel is achieved in that the bracket is a ring extending around the inner wall of the vessel. On the opposite side of the plate, a corresponding support of the plate is of course provided, for instance an outer ring extending around the central tube of the converter.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the connection between bracket and platelike element can be improved in that through holes for mounting bolts are formed in the same. By means of such mounting bolts, the bracket and the plate-like element can be welded, riveted or screwed to each other. The connection can of course also be improved by other mounting possibilities, e.g. grooves, seams or bevels.<br>
Furthermore, it can be provided in accordance with the invention that the bracket is supported from below by a supporting cone or a supporting bar.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, a supporting cone or supporting bar connected with the wall of the vessel supports on the plate-like element from above, in order to retain the same on the bracket.<br>
The connection between wall of vessel, supporting cone or supporting bar, bracket and plate; preferably is effected by welding.<br>
Developments, advantages and possible applications of the invention can also be taken from the following description of embodiments and the drawing. All features described and/or illustrated per se or in any combination form the subject-matter of the invention, independent of their inclusion in the claims or their back-reference.<br>
In the drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a converter for the conversion of S02 to SO3, Fig. 2 schematically shows the support of a plate on a vessel wall in accordance with the invention,<br>
Figs. 3 to 7 show variants of the support ring in accordance with the invention, and<br>
Fig. 8 shows the support ring of the invention in accordance with another embodiment.<br>
The contact boiler (converter, for example) 1 for converting SO2 to SO3 as shown in Fig. 1 includes a total of four contact stages (trays) K1 to K4, in which a catalyst containing in particular vanadium pentoxide is provided, in order to convert the sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide. S02-containing process gas is supplied to the converter 1 via a duct 2, which process gas traverses the contact stages K1 and K2 upon being heated in internal heat exchangers WT. The contact stages K1 to K4 are arranged annularly around a central tube 3 serving the gas supply and the accommodation of the heat exchangers WT.<br>
Via a duct 4, the S03-containing gas obtained is supplied to a non-illustrated heat recovery system and to the intermediate absorption, in order to largely remove the sulfur trioxide from the process gas. Via a duct 6, the S02- containing process gas is supplied to the top of the converter 1 and traverses the contact stages K3 and K4, before it is supplied to a non-illustrated heat recovery system and the final absorption via a duct 7. In so far, this is the conventional design of the converter of a sulphuric acid plant.<br>
The catalyst of the contact stages K1 to K4 is supported on trays 8 made of stainless steel. The trays 8 each constitute a circular ring around the central tube 3. The contact stages K1 to K4 are separated from each other by separating plates 9 made of stainless steel.<br>
As illustrated more clearly in Fig. 2, a bracket 11 is provided on the inner wall 10 of the converter 1, on which a tray 9 is supported. The bracket 11 constitutes a supporting ring, which extends around the entire inner circumference of the converter 1. On the outside of the central tube 3, a circumferential bracket is provided in a corresponding way not illustrated here, on which rests the ring-shaped tray 9. Accordingly, the tray 9 is annularly supported on the inside and on the outside.<br>
The supporting surface 12 of the bracket 11, on which rests the tray 8, is inclined downwards with respect to the horizontal proceeding from the inner wall 10 of the converter 1. Here, the supporting surface 12 has two succeeding radii R1 and R2 of different magnitude. The radius Rl, which is closer to the vessel wall 10, is larger than the radius R2 located further to the inside. The magnitude of the radii Rl, R2 is chosen in dependence on the size of the converter 1, the material characteristics of the tray 8 and the load applied by the contact stages K1 to K4 such that a plastic deformation of the tray 8 is limited by abutting against the bracket 11, before the deformation reaches a limit value in the amount of 10 to 20 times the elastic deformation. In commonly used converters, the radius Rl lies in the range from 500 to 900 mm, preferably 600 to 800 mm, and in particular is about 700 mm. The radius R2 generally lies in the range from 300 to 700 mm, preferably 400 to 600 mm, and in particular is about 500 mm. At the free end of the bracket 11, a radius R3 is provided, in order to avoid a sharp edge which might lead to a rupture of the tray 8. It is possible to provide a plurality of radii R1 to Rn on the supporting surface 12 of the bracket 11 , in order to prevent the deformation of the tray 8 in a corresponding number of stages n, with R1 &gt; R2 &gt; ... &gt; Ri &gt; ... &gt; Rn.<br>
Figs. 3 to 7 show different variants of the support ring of the invention, which effect an additional support of the connection between vessel wall 10, bracket 11 and tray 8.<br>
In Fig. 3, the bracket 11 is supported from below by a supporting bar 13, which is braced against the wall 10 of the converter 1.<br>
In the variant shown in Fig. 4, a supporting bar 14 connected with the wall 10 of the converter 1 supports on the tray 8 from above.<br>
In the variant shown in Fig. 5, a flat retaining plate 15 is provided above the tray 6, which retains the same on the bracket 11.<br>
In the variant shown in Fig. 6, through holes 16 and 17 are formed in the bracket 11 and the tray 8, respectively, through which extends a mounting bolt 18 which is welded to the tray 8 and the bracket 11. <br>
In the variant shown in Fig. 7, a mounting screw 19 extends through the through holes 16,17, so that the bracket 11 and the tray 8 are screwed to each other.<br>
It should be appreciated that the through holes 16, 17 and the mounting bolts 18 or screws 19 extending through the same are provided at numerous positions in the bracket 11 or the tray 8, which preferably are uniformly distributed over the circumference of the converter 1.<br>
It should also be appreciated that in the variants shown in Figs. 5 to 7 the supporting bar 13, 14 can also be provided above and/or below the bracket 11. The supporting bar 13, 14 can also constitute a plate extending around the circumference of the converter 1, which is welded to the wall 10 of the converter 1 and to the bracket 11 or the tray 8.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further variant of the configuration of the bracket, which can be provided in particular for use for supporting the separating plates 9 between the contact stages K1 to K4 of the converter 1.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the supporting surface 12 of the bracket 11a has a downward inclination proceeding from the inner wall 10 of the converter 1 in the range from 4 to 9°, preferably 5 to 8°, and in particular 6 to 7°. In this case, the inclined supporting ring 11a forms a tangent for the separating plate 9, when the same is deformed due to the high temperatures and the pressures in the vessel 1. It can also be provided that the separating plate 9 already is provided with a precurvature, so that the step of the initial plastic deformation of the separating plate 9 can be omitted and the tensions are directly converted into a tensile stress due to the tangent effect of the supporting plate 11a.<br>
The Figures each show embodiments, in which the supporting surface 12, 12a for the trays 8 or the separating plates 9 is inclined downwards. These embodiments are suitable in particular for applications in which the pressure load is exerted on the sheets 8, 9 from above. On the other hand, if a load acts on the sheet from below, for instance in the case of the separating plates 9 of a converter, the sheet can rest against the bracket from below in a manner not illustrated here, and the lower contact surface of the bracket can recede upwards with respect to the horizontal, in order to allow a plastic deformation of the sheet in the direction of the force exerted on the sheet. The configuration of this contact surface is effected similar to the configuration of the supporting surface 12, 12a described above.<br>
As a result of the inventive idea to stop the plastic deformation of the platelike element by abutting against the bracket 11, 11a and substantially completely convert the bending stresses into tensile stresses, a much smaller deformation of the system can be achieved. An additional support of the tray by means of a heavy and expensive grid structure can be omitted. With equal safety, a considerable saving of material thus can be achieved.<br>
By means of the invention, at least 70% of the material can be saved by omitting the grid structure supporting the tray.<br>
