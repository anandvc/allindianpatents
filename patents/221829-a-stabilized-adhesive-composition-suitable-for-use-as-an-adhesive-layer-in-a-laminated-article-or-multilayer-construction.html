STABILIZED ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING HIGHLY SOLUBLE,<br>
RED-SHIFTED. PHOTOSTABLE BENZOTRIAZOLE UV ABSORBERS AND<br>
LAMINATED ARTICLES DERIVED THEREFROM<br>
This invention pertains to stabilized adhesive compositions containing an effective amount of a benzotriazole UV absorber having enhanced solubility, durability and absorption in the 350 to 400 nm range. Also subject of the invention are stabilized adhesive compositions containing an effective amount of a benzotriazole substituted in the ortho position of the hydroxyphenyl ring by α-cumyl or phenyl, such as 2-(2-hydroxy-3-α-cumyl-5" tert-octylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole having enhanced solubility and durability. A further subject of the invention pertains to novel asymmetrical bisbenzotriazole compounds which are red-shifted, and are particularly soluble due to that asymmetry and which are useful in a host of end-use applications.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Adhesives are made up of various components such as polymers, tackifiers, waxes and oils. Adhesive formulations based on these ingredients are susceptible to degradation. The consequences of degradation are discoloration, loss of elongation, loss of tensile strength, loss of tack and change in viscosity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Degradation can be caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight. Sunlight contains invisible ultraviolet (UV) radiation with wavelengths between 290 and 400 nm. This radiation is responsible for the initiation of photodegradation.<br>
Absorption of UV light by chromophores present in the adhesive formulation transforms the chromophores into their excited states which can undergo further undesired reactions. Some polymers contain strongly absorbing chromophores as a major part of their structures. Other polymers contain unintentional impurities such as ketones and hydroperoxide moieties and catalyst residues which act as chromophores. Absorption of UV radiation by these chromophores eventually results in bond cleavage, chain scission and/or crossiinking reactions.<br>
Photostabilization of adhesives can be achieved by the addition of UV absorbers which convert the absorbed energy into harmless heat. An ideal UV absorber should be<br><br>
extremely photostable and have strong abdorption over the UV range from 29 to 400, but particularly the range of 350 to 400 nm. Classes of UV absorbers include the salicylates, cyanoacrylates. malonates, oxanilides, benzophenones, s-triazines and benzotriazoles.<br>
Salicylates, cyanoacrylates. malonates and oxanilides absorb UV light primarily at the lower wavelengths of the UV range. These compounds have little to no absorption in the range of 350 to 400 nm which make them unsuitable for the instant applications. Benzophenones absorb over the lower half of the UV range, and they tend to be prone to yellowing upon light exposure due to photodegradation. Recently, it has been shown photochemically that benzophenones decompose prematurely in ethylene-vinyl acetate encapsulants which lead to the production of polyenic chromophores. This color generation from light yellow to brown is not only highly undesirable and unsightly in adhesive systems, but also can result in a loss of adhesive properties. By contrast, selected benzotriazole UV absorbers are particularly useful because of their increased photostability.<br>
Some polymers such as polycarbonates, polyesters and aromatic polyurethanes contain strongly absorbing chromophores as a major and integral part of their structures. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate) (PEN) are particular examples the latter of which absorbs into the red UV region and especially need red-shifted benzotriazoles for UV protection. U.S. Patent No. 5,294,473 and WO 98/34981 teach the use of coatings containing UV absorbers including some benzotriazoles in stabilizing PEN films. Adding an adhesive UV screening layer containing the benzotriazoles, especially those described in the instant invention, further protects such polymers in multilayered constructions and articles.<br>
The description, preparation and uses of the 2H-benzotriazole UV absorbers are described in United States Patent Nos. 3.004,896; 3,055,896; 3,072,585; 3,074,910; 3.189.615; 3,230.194; 4,127,586; 4,226.763; 4,278,589; 4,315.848; 4,383.863; 4,675,352; 4,681.905 and 4,853.471,<br>
Selected benzotriazoles with just hydrogen or halogen at the 5-position of the benzo ring are photostable and soluble in adhesive formulations. One such benzotriazole is 2-(2-hydroxy-3-a-cumyl-5-tert-octytphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole as described in United States Patent Nos. 5.554.760; 5,563,242; 5,574,166 and 5,607,987. These patents are<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference. While the absorbance of this benzotriazole is not red-shifted toward longer UV wavelengths, it is very photostable and is amazingly soluble in adhesives making it especially well-suited for the instant applications.<br>
Although benzotriazoles with just hydrogen at the 5-position of the benzo ring are photostable and useful in adhesive formulations, they lack a red-shifted absorbance toward longer UV wavelengths which would be most useful in giving added protection to the substrates. United States Patent Nos. 5,319,091 and 5,410,071 described the preparation of benzotriazoles substituted at the 5-position of the benzo ring with alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyl moieties. It is taught in United States Patent No. 5,280,124 that by introducing a higher alkyl or aryl sulfoxide or sulfone at the 5-position of the benzo ring of the benzotriazole, the resulting benzotriazole exhibits enhanced absorption in the near visible range (over 350 nm). Such sulfone substituted products were shown to be useful in automotive coatings applications. Additionally such an electron withdrawing group dramatically increases the photostability of these benzotriazole UV absorbers in automotive coatings. Quite surprisingly, these red-shifted benzotriazoles and particularly the asymetric substituted ones are amazingly soluble in adhesives making them especially well-suited for the instant applications.<br>
It is known in the art that the concomitant use of a hindered amine light stabilizer with a UV absorber such as a benzotriazole provides excellent-stabilization in many polymer compositions as summarized by G. Berner and M. Rembold, "New Light Stabilizers for High Solids Coatings", Organic Coatings and Science and Technology, Vol. 6, Dekkar, New York, pp 55-85.<br>
The benzotriazole UV absorbers represent a special class of commercial UV absorbers as described above. Only a few references refer to substitution on the benzo ring by an aryl or alkyl sulfoxide or sulfonyl moiety.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,218.332 discloses benzotriazoles substituted at the 5-position of the benzo ring by a lower alkyl sulfonyl moiety. However, this patent deals with putting reactable groups, namely alkenyl groups, at the 3-position on the phenyl ring and is of little relevance to the instant application. United States Patent Nos. 5,268,450 and 5,319.091 disclose polymer compositions and a process for the production of substituted aryl thio and<br><br>
aryl sulfonyl benzotriazoles which are covalently bound to polymers, sucn as poly{phenytene sulfide), RYTON®. Phillips Petroleum. United States Patent No. 5,280,124 discloses benzotriazoles with only higher alkyl or aryl sulfinyt or sulfonyl moieties at the 5-position of the benzo ring which are useful for protecting thermoset automotive coatings.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 92-352228 discloses the use of 5-ethylsulfonyi benzotriazoles with the 3-position of the phenyl ring being unsubstituted or substituted by methyl for the UV protection of dust proof poly(vinyl chloride) resin films. These compounds when studied in the instant adhesive compositions were found to be quite insoluble and totally useless for the instant adhesive compositions. By contrast, when a tertiary alkyl group is inserted at the 3-position of the phenyl ring, the solubility of the thus substituted benzotriazole in adhesive composition is surprisingly enhanced.<br>
The instant in 5 position substituted compounds exhibit enhanced broadened absorption characteristics particularly in the long wavelength UV region (over 350 nm) when compared with compounds of the prior art. Additionally, the instant compounds have surprising and unexpectedly high solubility in adhesives making them especially well suited for use in adhesive formulations.<br>
Bisbenzotriazoles such as 2,2'-methylene-bis[4-tert-octyl-6-(2H-ben20triazolyl-2-yl)phenol], TINUVIN® 360 (Ciba) are described in United States Patent No. 5,299,521. While useful, these compounds are not red-shifted.<br>
German 1,670,951 describes generically both symmetrical and asymmetrical alkylene-bisbenzotriazoles, but specifically only some symmetical bisbenzotriazoles which are outside of the scope of the instant claims. None of the compounds described in German 1,670,951 are substituted by a perfluroalkyi moiety, such as by CF3.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,812,498 describes symmetrical bisbenzotriazoles as stabilizers for polycarbonate resins. The bisbenzotriazoles are symmetrical in structure, do not contain perfluoroalkyi moieties, and are clearly outside the scope of the instant compounds.<br>
EP 924,203 A1 describes bisbenzotriazole compounds each containing a polymerizable made therefor,. None of these prior art bisbenzotriazoles is red-<br><br>
shifted or contains a perfluoroaikyl group. The instant compounds are clearly aisiinguisned From these prior bisbenzotriazoles.<br>
The effect of UV light on laminated articles that are exposed to the sun or other sources of UV light are of great concern to the manufacturers of such articles. Over time, constant or repeated exposure to UV light can result in dye and/or pigment fade for dyes and/or pigments used in such articles and in the degradation or breakdown of the adhesives, polymers or other materials used in the construction of the articles. The aforementioned fading and degradation shorten the useful life of the articles in question, making protection from UV light exposure an issue of great importance to the manufacturers of such articles.<br>
Molecules known as UV absorbers are generally known in the art. However, due to the differences discussed above between the various UV absorber classes, it is the benzotriazoles and articles containing them which will be discussed here. Due to the incompatibility and low solubility of certain benzotriazoles, a need exists for selected benzotriazoles that are highly soluble and which would provide added protection in the 350 to 400 nm region of the ultraviolet. T. Nagashima et al.. J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 178 (1994). 182. report recently ultraviolet light (UV) shielding glass, which is UV absorbing over the range of long wavelengths (320-400 nm) to avoid sunburn effects, has become an important issue because of the possible hazard of skin cancer due to depletion of the ozone layer."<br>
In addition, articles which incorporate the selected benzotriazoles of the instant invention are useful in protecting interior structures, textiles and fabrics from UV induced photodegradation such as in automotive applications.<br>
International application WO 97/32225 describes the use of PEN films having reflective and polarizing elements for use as optical films.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,770,114 discloses stabilized compositions containing soluble benzotriazoles that are used in electrochromic devices. However, these benzotriazoles lack the red-shifted absorption at the 350 to 400 nm region.<br>

In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the organic material is a recording material.<br>
The recording materials according to the invention are suitable for pressure-sensitive copying systems, photocopying systems using microcapsules, heat-sensitive copying systems, photographic materials and ink jet printing.<br>
The recording materials according to the invention are distinguished by an unexpected improvement in quality, especially with regard to the fastness to light.<br>
The recording materials according to the invention have the construction known for the particular use. They consist of a customary carrier, for example, paper or plastic film, which has been coated with one or more layers. Depending on the type of material, these layers contain the appropriate necessary components, in the case of photographic materials, for example, silver halide emulsions, dye couplers, dyes and the like. Material particularly suitable for ink jet printing has a layer particularly absorptive for ink on a customary carrier. Uncoated paper can also be employed for Inkjet printing. In this case the paper acts at the same time as the carrier material and as the ink-absorbent layer. Suitable material for ink jet printing is, for example, described in United States Patent No. 5,073,448 which is incorporated herE1n by reference.<br>
The recording material can also be transparent as, for example, in the case of projection films.<br>
The compounds of formula lllc can be incorporated into the carder material as early as the production of the latter, in the production of paper, for example, bE1ng added to the paper<br><br>
pulp. A second method of application is to spray the carder material with an aqueous solution of compounds of formula lllc or to add the compounds to the coating composition.<br>
Coating compositions intended for transparent recording materials suitable for projection cannot contain any particles which scatter light, such as pigments and fillers.<br>
The dye-binding coating composition can contain a number of other additives, for example, antioxidants, light stabilizers (including also UV absorbers which do not fall under the scope of the UV absorbers of this invention), viscosity improvers, fluorescent brighteners, biocides and/or antistatic agents.<br>
The coating composition is usually prepared as follows: the water-soluble components, for example, the binder, are dissolved in water and stirred together; the solid components, for example, fillers and other additives already described, are dispersed in this aqueous medium; and disperison is advantageously carried out by means of devices, for example, ultrasonic systems, turbine stirrers, homogenizers, colloid mills, bead mills, sand mills, highspeed stirrers and the like. The compounds of formula lllc can be easily incorporated into the coating composition.<br>
The recording material according to this invention preferably contains 1 to 5000 mg/m2 in particular 50-1200 mg/m2, of a compound of formula lllc.<br>
As already mentioned, the recording materials according to the invention embrace a wide field. The compounds of formula lllc can, for example, be employed in pressure-sensitive copying systems. They can be introduced E1ther into the paper in order to protect the microencapsulated dye precursors there from light, or into the binder of the developer layer in order to protect the dyes formed there.<br>
Photocopying systems using light-sensitive microcapsules which are developed by means of pressure are described in United States Patent Nos. 4,416,966; 4,483,912; 4,352,200; 4.535.050; 4,535.463; 4,551.407; 4,562,137 and 4,608,330; and also in EP-A 139.479; EP-A 162.664; EP-A 164.931; EP-A 237,024; EP-A 237,025 and EP-A 260,129. In all these systems, the compounds can be put into the dye-recE1ving layer. The compounds can, however, also be put into the donor layer in order to protect the color formers from light.<br><br>
Photographic materials which can be stabilized are photographic dyes and layers containing such dyes or precursors thereof, for example, photographic paper and films. Suitable materials are, for example, described in United States Patent No. 5,364,749 which is incorporated herE1n by reference. The compounds of formula I lIe act here as a UV filter against electrostatic flashes. In color photographic materials, couplers and dyes are also protected against photochemical decomposition.<br>
The instant compounds of formula lllc can be used for all types of color photographic materials. For example, they can be employed for color paper, color reversal paper, direct-positive color material, color negative film, color positive film, color reversal film and the like. They are preferably used inter alia for photographic color material which contains a reversal substrate or form positives.<br>
Color-photographic recording materials usually contain, on a support, a blue-sensitive and/or a green-sensitive and/or a red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and. if desired, a protection layer, with the instant compounds bE1ng, preferably, E1ther in the green-sensitive or the red-sensitive layer or in a layer between the green-sensitive and the red-sensitive layer or in a layer on top of the silver halide emulsion layers.<br>
The compounds of formula lllc can also be employed in recording materials based on the principles of photopolymerization, photoplasticization or the rupture of microcapsules, or in cases where heat-sensitive and light-sensitive diazonium salts, leuko dyes having an oxidizing agent or dye lactones having Lewis acids are used.<br>
Furthermore, the instant compounds can be employed in recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing, thermal wax transfer printing and non-matrix printing and for use with electrostatic, electrographic, E1ectrophoretic, magnetographic and laser-electrophotographic printers and pen-plotters. Of the above, recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing are preferred, for example, as described in EP-A 507,734.<br>
The instant compounds of formula lllc can also be employed in inks, preferably for ink jet printing, for example, as described in United States Patent No. 5,098.477 which is incorporated herE1n by reference.<br><br>
The compounds exhibit superior hydrolytic stability, handling and storage stability as well as good resistance to extractabiiity when present in a stabilized composition.<br>
The instant benzotriazoles are made by conventional methods for preparing such compounds. The usual procedure involves the diazotization of a substituted o-nitroaniline followed by coupling the resultant diazonium salt with a substituted phenol and reduction of the azobenzene intermediate to the corresponding desired benzotriazole. The starting materials for these benzotriazoles are largely items of commerce or can be prepared by normal methods of organic synthesis.<br>

Example A3 Benzotriazole Solubility in Adhesive To measure this solubility a number of structurally different benzotriazoles are added to a typical adhesive GELVA® 263 (Solutia) which is a 44.5% solution of a polyacrylate in a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane. The polyacrylate is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
The test benzotriazole is dissolved in 5 mL of ethyl acetate, toluene or a mixture of ethyl acetate and toluene. To the solution is added 5 g of GELVA® 263 and 2-3 mL of the resulting solution is placed into individual watch glasses. Solubility is then evaluated based upon observed crystallization once the solvent has evaporated. Observations start after<br><br>
several hours and then continue over a period of several weeks.<br>
The solubility values given in the table below are approximate maximum concentrations where no sign of subsequent crystallization is evident. Solubilities are reported in wE1ght of total benzotriazole added to GELVA® 263 as is. From these data it dear that the instant benzotriazoles are considerably more soluble in adhesives (in this case GELVA® 263) than many benzotriazoles of the prior art. The use of many benzotriazoles in adhesives has been limited in the past by the limited solubility and compatibility of some benzotriazole compounds. By using the instant benzotriazoles, the use levels can be increased substantially to add greatly increased stabilization protection which is further augmented by the photostability and the red-shiftedness of the instant benzotriazoles.<br><br>

Example A5 Weathering Experiments To ascertain the effect of durability and loss rate of various benzotriazole test compounds, the following test is carried out on adhesive compositions in selected articles.<br>
GELVA® 263 (Solutia) adhesive is described in Example 3. A biaxially oriented poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film is obtained from United States Plastics.<br>
The GELVA® 263 is reduced 50% by dilution with ethyl acetate to a final resin solids content of 23%. The test compound is dissolved in the GELVA® 263 solution and samples are prepared in duplicate. The formulations seen in the table below are based on total coating solids. Approximately 8 micron coatings are applied to 1.5 inch glass discs for<br><br>
ch formulation using a Headway Research Inc. Photo Resist Spinner (Model EC101DT)<br>
o<br>
erating at 5000 rpm for 10 seconds. All formulations recE1ve the same 80 C x 3 minute ke in a Hereaus model LUT 6050F oven operating at 3 air changes/minute.<br>
Since the adhesive remains tacky even after baking a direct thickness sasurement is not possible. Indirect film thickness is determined by creating an adhesive ndwich between to layers of PET film and comparing its thickness versus two PET sheets thout adhesive using magnetic induction methodology.<br>
The spin coating conditions are thus obtained. Further, since the spin coating nditions are not changed for applying the adhesive onto the glass, very little if any ickness variations are expected. After curing it in an oven, a layer of PET (ca 2 mils) is aced over the adhesive and pressed down.<br>
Absorbance spectra are collected using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 ^ectrophotometer running UVWINLAB software. Absorbance data are collected from 400-)0 nm every half nanometer at a speed of 240 nm/minute and a slit width of 2 nm.<br>
Weathering is done at a controlled irradiance at 6500 W. The cycle is as follows: 8 hours straight irradiance with no water spray, followed by one hour darkness. In the light<br>
0<br>
'cle, the black panel temperature is controlled at 89 C. The chamber (dry bulb) temperature 62 C in the light cycle. The relative humidity in the light cycle is in the range of 50-55% id in the dark cycle 95%. The chamber (dry bulb) temperature is 38 C in the dark cycle.<br>
The test samples are placed in a Xenon Arc Weather-O-meter with the glass facing e Xenon lamp to emulate articles such as solar films. UV spectra are obtained at about 50 hour intervals. UV spectra are obtained at 500 hours and the samples are rotated to sure that all samples recE1ve similar weathering conditions.<br>
To follow the loss of the UV absorber from the adhesive composition, UV spectra leasured initially and after weathering. The UV spectrophotometer measure absorbance learly up to 5.5 absorbance units using a reference beam attenuation technique.<br>
It is assumed that the degradation products for the UV absorber do not contribute to<br><br>
the UV spectrum. This is tested by following the ratio of absorbance of the band at 300 nm and the band at about 340 nm. The ratio does not change upon weathering the sample. This suggests that the UV spectrum of the weathered films correspond to the amount of UV absorber remaining in the film with very little if any contribution to the spectrum by the photodegradants.<br>
The results after 893 hours exposure are given in the table below.<br>

These data clearly show that the instant benzotriazole is especially durable in adhesives as measured by the low loss rate of absorbance values after exposure to actinic radiation. The instant benzotriazoles such as 2-(2-hydroxy-3-α-cumyl-5-tert-octylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole even though not red-shifted as well<br><br>
as the red-shifted benzotriazoles are far superior to the benzophenones in adhesive compositions. Furthermore, the combination of the benzotriazoles with a hindered amine stabilizer offers quite superior performance. In summary, the instant benzotriazoles combine both great photostability and unexpectedly high solubility in adhesive systems.<br>

Example A7 Windshield InteHayer Assembly ' When an adhesive composition containing a benzotriazole UV absorber is placed between two sheets of glass, the assembly resembles a typical windshield. In this confined environment, there is no chance that the benzotriazole stabilizer can escape by volatility since the glass sheets provide a impervious container for the adhesive interlayer. The photostability and durability of the soluble benzotriazole stabilizer is now paramount. Benzotriazole UV absorbers whose structures causes them to be volatile and which precludes thE1r use in other types of applications can be used in such windshield interiayer assemblies with impunity to achieve long lasting and stable windshield structures.<br>

Example B6 Bisbenzotriazole Solubility in Adhesive<br>
To measure the solubility of the instant bisbenzotriazole UV absorber in an adhesive composition, the compound is added to a typical adhesive GELVA® 263 (Solutia) which is a 44.5% solution of a polyacrylate in a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane. The polyacrylate is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
The test compound is dissolved in 5 mL of ethyl acetate, toluene or a mixture of ethyl acetate and toluene. To the solution is added 5 g of GELVA® 263. 2-3 mL of the resulting solution is place into individual watch glasses. Solubility is then evaluated based upon observed crystallization once the solvent has evaporated. Observations start after several hours and then continue over a period of several weeks.<br>
The solubility values given in the table below are approximate maximum concentrations where no sign of subsequent crystallization is evident. Solubilities are reported in wE1ght of total bisbenzotriazole added to GELVA® 263 as is. From these data, it<br><br>
is clear that some of the instant bisbenzotriazoles are considerably more soluble in adhesives, in this case GELVA® 263, than some bisbenzothazoles of the prior art. The use of many UV absorbers in adhesive compositions has been limited in the past by the limited .  solubility and compatibility of some UV absorber compounds.<br>
By using the selected instant bisbenzotriazoles, the use levels for the UV absorber can be raised substantially to add greatly to increased stabilization protection afforded by the instant compound. This is further augmented by the excellent photostability and red-shifted nature of the instant bisbenzotriazoles.<br>

The dry blend is extruded and pelletized using a twin screw extruder at a melt temperature of about 410°F (210°C). The pellets are molded into test plaques (2- x 2- x 0.060-) using an injection molder operated at 410-420°F (204-216°C). The plaques are exposed in a Xenon-arc Weather-Ometer according to automotive test procedure SAE J1885. Exposure is measured in terms of the total irradiation, measured in kilojoules per square meter (kJ/m^). Color change in the exposed samples is determined by measuring the color of the exposed samples compared to the unexposed samples as color difference (AE) according to ASTM D2244.<br>

The pellets are molded into test plaques (2- X 2- X 0.060-) using an injection molder operated at 475-515°F (246-268°C). The plaques are exposed in a Xenon arc Weather-Ometer according to ASTM G26 test method A. Gloss is measure at 60o on the unexposed and exposed samples using a glossmeter according to ASTM D523.

Example 35<br>
Poly(methyl methacrylate) The durability of the instant benzotriazoles in thermoplastic substrates is determined by incorporating various test compounds into solvent cast films of a poly(methyl methacrylate) resin.

Loss of UV absorber is determined by monitoring the loss of diagnostic UV absorption as described eariier. Performance is measured by a change in color or the physical integrity of the film, or in loss of absorbance of the UV absorber at λmax.<br><br>
Poly(methyl methacrylate), medium molecular wE1ght, Aldrich, is dissolved in methylene chloride at room temperature along with between 1 and 3% by wE1ght of test benzotriazole, based on the PMMA resin. Films are cast using a calibrated drawdown bar to prepare 1 mil thick film after drying.<br>

Example 36<br>
Polyurethane An acrylic polyol (RK 4037, DuPont) which is 75% solids in methyl amyl ketone is used in these experiments. The molecular wE1ght is 7000-9000 and the OH number is 145. To 595 g of the acrylic polyol are added 26.2 g of butyl acetate, 5.8 g of ethyl acetate and 0.4 g of 50% strength FC 439 (flow control aid, 3M). Bis(1-octylocy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate (0.75 g T1NUV1N®123, Ciba), 1% by wE1ght based on resin solids, is added to the mixture. To 2.43 g of the above mixture is added 0.9 g of DESMODUR®N-3390 (Bayer), an aliphatic polyisocyanate, 90% solids. The UV absorber is incorporated into the acrylic polyol component. The polyurethane formed is applied as a coating onto a quartz disc by spin coating at 1000 rpm for two seconds. The wet coating is cured at 260°F (127*^C) for 30 minutes.<br>
UV spectra are collected using a X-9 spectrophotometer from Perkin Elmer every half nm at 120 nm/min using a slit width of 2 nm.<br>
Loss rates are measured from a 1.4 mil coating. The absorbance of the long wavelength UV absorbance band is around 2.3 before weathering. Weathering is done according to SAE J-1960 (exterior automotive weathering conditions): 0.55 watts/sq. in. at 340 nm using inner and outer borosilicate filters, 40' straight irradiance with no water spray; 20' light plus front spray; 60' light and 60' dark plus rear spray (condensation). Black panel temperature in light cycle is 70±2°C and relative humidity of 50-55% in light cycle and 100%<br><br>
in dark cycle. The loss of long wavelength absorbance band is followed after approximately every 200 hours.<br>

This test shows that the instant bisbenzotriazoles are especially durable in PVC films as judged by low loss rates.<br>
Example 38<br>
Coating Composition A high solids thermoset acrylic clear coat is prepared by mixing an experimental acrylic polyol resin and hexamethoxymethylmelamine (Resimene® 747, Monsanto) at a solids ratio of 60/40. The dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid catalyst (Nacure®5225; King Industries) is added at 0.70% by wE1ght. A flow aid Modaflow® (Monsanto) is added at 0.25% by wE1ght to form a model acrylic melamine resin system.<br>
The model clear coat is reduced with xylene to a viscosity of 26-27 second using a Zahn #2 cup and applied via a conventional air spray at 50 psi (3,5 Kg/cm^) over a 1- x 3-(2.54 cm x 7.62 cm) quartz slide. Cure is achieved by baking the slide for 30 minutes at 260°F (127°C). The clear coat is stabilized with 1% by wE1ght of a hindered amine light stabilizer, bis-(1-octyloxy-2.2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate, (TINUVIN® 123, Ciba). The various test benzotriazole UV absorbers are incorporated at the 5 mmol % by wE1ght in<br><br>
the clear coat. The film thickness on the quartz slides/ange from 1.15 to 1.41 mils (0.029 to 0.036 mm).<br>
The films on the quartz slides are weathered according to the following conditions in Xenon Arc Weather-Ometer with a controlled irradiance at 6500 W, using inner quartz and outer borosilicate S-type filter. The irradiation cycle is as follows: 40 minutes of straight irradiation with no water spray, followed by 20 minutes of light plus front spray, followed by 60 minutes of light irradiation and finally by 60 minutes dart plus rear spray (condensation). The setting is at 0.55 W/M2 at 340 nm, 1.98 kJ/hour. In the light cycle the black panel temperature is controlled at 70±2°C. The relative humidity in the light cycle is in the range of 50-55% and in the dark cycle 100%. The absorbance of the long wavelength UV band as a function of Xenon arc weathering hours are recorded,<br>
To follow the loss of UV absorbers from the clear coats, UV spectra are measured initially and after weathering at regular time intervals. The UV spectrophotometer measures absorbance linearly up to 5.5 absorbance units using a reference beam attenuation technique.<br>
It is assumed that the degradation products from the UV absorber do not contribute to the UV spectrum. This is tested by following the ratio of absorbance of the band at about 300 nm and the band at about 340 nm. The ratio does not change upon weathering the sample, This suggests that the UV spectrum of the weathered films correspond to the amount of UV absorber remaining in the film with very little if any contribution to the spectrum by photo degradants.<br>
Representative bisbenzotriazole test compounds are incorporated into a high solid thermoset acrylic melamine resin at concentrations between 1.93 and 3% by wE1ght to give equal molar concentrations of the test benzotriazole in equal film thickness and sufficient to give a starting absorbance of approximately 2.0 absorbance units. The test samples are exposed for 2000 hours.<br>
The test shows that the instant bisbenzotriazoles are especially durable in automotive coatings as judged by low loss rates.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
