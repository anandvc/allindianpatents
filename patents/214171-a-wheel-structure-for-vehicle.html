COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
A WHEEL STRUCTURE FOR VEHICLE<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
not influenced by wear powders of a brake mechanism and the brake mechanism is not influenced by heat of the electric motor, and which is suited to be small and compact. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
As a wheel structure for a vehicle, for example, one described in the publication "Electrically-operated small vehicle" of Japanese Unexamined Utility Model No. Sho-49-13 2 54 6 is known.<br>
FIG. 2 of the publication describes a wheel structure such that a hub 5 (which is a reference numeral used in the publication, the other numerals are also numerals used in the publication) is rotatably attached to an axle 6 via a bearing 7, a tire 4 is attached to the hub 5, and an electric motor is disposed in a wheel by attaching an armature 9 to the axle 6 and attaching a field 8 to the hub 5. [0003]<br>
[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
A brake mechanism is usually attached to a wheel.  In the case of attaching a brake mechanism to the above-described wheel, for example, a structure that a drum brake or a disc brake is disposed between a side wall of the hub 5 and the vehicle body side may be used. [0004]<br>
In such a structure, the wheel and the brake mechanism are arranged in the extending direction of the axle 6, so that the vehicle width increases. Consequently, the structure is not suitable for, for example, a motorcycle. Also in the case<br><br>
where the drum brake is disposed in the wheel and adjacent to the armature 9, the width of the wheel increases. Moreover, there is the possibility that wear powders of the brake mechanism are adhered to the field 8 in the wheel and exert an influence on the performance of the electric motor. Also heat generation of the electric motor may exert an influence on the performance of the brake mechanism. [0005]<br>
An object of the invention is therefore to improve the wheel structure, thereby preventing the electric motor from being influenced by wear powders of the brake mechanism and preventing the brake mechanism from being influenced by heat generation of the electric motor and, to provide a small and compact wheel having therein an electric motor. [0006]<br>
[Means for solving the Problems]<br>
To achieve the object, in claim 1, there is provided a wheel structure of a motor-built-in type, having an electric motor for driving a wheel for a vehicle, which is provided in the wheel, characterized in that a brake mechanism for braking the wheel is disposed on the inside in the radial direction of the electric motor. [0007]<br>
When the brake mechanism and the electric motor are separated from each other, the wear powders of the brake mechanism do not adhere a permanent magnet of the electric motor, so that an influence is not exerted on the performance of the electric motor. Thus, the performance of the electric motor<br><br>
can be maintained.<br>
The electric motor and the brake mechanism can be disposed concentrically, so that the width of the wheel can be reduced, and a small and compact wheel can be achieved. [0008]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the electric motor and the brake mechanism are provided on the same side of a disc of the wheel.<br>
Since the electric motor and the brake are provided on the same side of the disc of the wheel, performance of assembling the electric motor and the brake mechanism to the wheel and performance of maintenance on the electric motor and the brake mechanism can be improved. [0009]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that the brake mechanism is a drum brake, and an arm member for rotatably supporting the wheel is a member which serves as a brake panel of the drum brake and to which a stator of the electric motor is attached. [0010]<br>
Since the arm member serves as the brake panel of the drum brake and the member to which the stator is attached, as compared with the case of specially providing a brake panel and a member to which a stator is attached, the number of parts can be decreased, and the part cost can be suppressed. Parts of the drum brake and the stator can be sub-assembled to the arm member at the time of manufacture. By attaching the wheel to the arm member to which the parts are sub-assembled, the productivity can be increased.<br><br><br>
[0011]<br>
Claim 4 is characterized in that the electric motor has a rotary magnet member rotating integrally with the wheel, the rotary magnet member has a magnetic ring and a permanent magnet fixed to the magnetic ring, and the magnetic ring is positioned in the wheel by a positioning pin.<br>
[0012]		<br>
By providing the wheel with the rotary magnet member, for example, as compared with the case where the wheel is provided with the stator which takes the form of a coil, a slip ring mechanism for passing current to the stator and the like becomes unnecessary and the structure is simplified. By constructing the rotary magnet member by the magnetic ring and the permanent magnet fixed to the magnetic ring, the magnetic ring to which the permanent magnet is preliminarily fixed can be attached to the wheel. Therefore, the assembly performance can be improved as compared with the case of directly attaching the permanent magnet to the wheel.<br>
Further, by the positioning pin, the magnetic ring can be prevented from rotating. [0013]<br>

An embodiment of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the attached drawings. The drawings are to be seen according to the direction of a reference numeral.<br><br><br>

The folding action of the two-wheel vehicle 10 will be described briefly.<br>
FIG. 3 is an action diagram for explaining folding of the two-wheel vehicle according to the invention and will be described in order.<br>
1) In a state shown in FIG. 2, first, the brake is applied on the front wheel 11 to lock the front wheel 11 and a switch for making the electric motor in the rear wheel 12 operate is turned on. Specifically, the rear wheel.12 is rotated in the same rotating direction (forward rotation) as that in a driving mode. In FIG. 3, by the rotation, the rear wheel 12 approaches the front wheel 11, the front swing arm 37 on the front wheel<br><br>
11 side and the rear swing arm 42 on the rear wheel 12 side<br>
i<br>
swing in the directions of the arrows (D and (2) around the front swing shaft 57 and the rear swing shaft 58 as a center, respectively. When the switch is turned on, the control unit releases the lock mechanism of the front and rear wheels and drives the motor in a procedure which will be described hereinlater. [0021]<br>
2)	As shown by ®, the handlebars 17 and 18 (the handlebar<br>
18 on the depth side is not shown) are folded to the inside,<br>
the rear-view mirrors 21 and 22 (the rear-view mirror 22 on<br>
the depth side is not shown) are folded as shown by the arrow<br>
(3), the handle post 23 is tilted to the rear portion of the body<br>
as shown by the arrow (D, and the handlebars 17 and 18 and the<br>
rear-view mirrors 21 and 22 are housed in the body via the<br>
opening. During the operation, the housing net 66 and the<br>
handlebars 17 and 18 do not interfere with each other, so that<br>
the folding operation can be performed in a state where articles<br>
are housed.<br>
[0022]<br>
3)	As shown by the arrow ©, the seat 13 is moved forward.<br>
4)	The steps 15 and 16 (the step 16 on the depth side is not shown) are jumped upward as shown by the arrow ©. [0023]<br>
The operation of folding the two-wheel vehicle 10 is completed. The folding order is not limited to the above. For example, after moving the seat 13 forward, the handle post 23 may be tilted backward together with the folded handlebars 17<br><br>
and 18.<br>
By folding the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12, the minimum road clearance of the body becomes higher than that in the driving mode shown in FIG. 2. Consequently, the stand 51 is swung from the position shown in FIG. 2 to a downward position and fixed.<br>
In a state where th§ two-wheel vehicle 10 is folded, the two-wheel vehicle 10 has an almost rectangular parallelepiped shape which is flat in the lateral direction, and has a width almost equal to the width of 170 mm of the number plate 14 of a motor-bike. Thus, the two-wheel vehicle 10 can be easily housed in a member of a four-wheel vehicle, particularly, an outer panel, so that both reinforcement of the four-wheel vehicle and mounting of the two-wheel vehicle can be achieved. [0024]<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing a state where the two-wheel vehicle according to the invention is mounted on a four-wheel vehicle. It shows a state where the two-wheel vehicle 10 is housed in a door 72 attached to a side body 71 as a component of the body of a four-wheel vehicle 70.<br>
The parts of the two-wheel vehicle 10 are folded so that the vehicle width is within the width of the number plate 14 (refer to FIG. 3) as described above, so that the width of a space for housing the two-wheel vehicle 10 can be reduced and the door 72 can be made thin. Therefore, the space in the compartment of the four-wheel vehicle 70 can be sufficiently assured. [0025]<br><br>
The four-wheel vehicle 70 has outer panels 76, 77, and 78 made of transparent or semi-transparent outer-panel material (such as glass) in the door 72 having pipe members forming the outline as a body constructing member and side walls 73 and 74 as body constructing members.  Consequently, the two-wheel vehicle 10 mounted on the four-wheel vehicle 70 can be seen from the outside. The design has a feature that it is known at a glance that the folded two-wheel vehicle 10 is mounted on the four-wheel vehicle 70. The attractiveness of the product can be improved and there is no worry that the user forgets to unload the two-wheel vehicle 10. [0026]<br>
The four-wheel vehicle 70 also has an in-vehicle generator 301 disposed in a lower space S of the side wall 74. The in-vehicle generator 301 is a water-cooled four-cycle engine integrated multi-pole alternator having therein a starter. [0027]<br>
FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view showing a wheel structure according to the invention and shows the wheel 68 of the rear wheel 12.<br>
The wheel 68 of the rear wheel 12 has a magnet ring 106 for a sensor, which is detected by a not-illustrated rotation sensor provided on the rear swing arm 42 side, a rotary magnet member 12 obtained by alternately arranging a plurality of permanent magnets 107 and 108 on the inside of a magnetic ring 111, and a fixing ring 113 for fixing the rotary magnet member 112 to the inside of the wheel 68.  The rear swing arm 42 has<br><br><br>
a stator 115 for integrally supporting a not- shown stator coil. [0028]<br>

[0030]<br><br>
The rear swing arm 42 has a projection 135 around the axle 117. The stator 115 is attached to the projection 135 by bolts 137 ... and the projection 135 serves as a brake panel (a component of the drum brake 126).<br>
Specifically, the projection 135 is a member to which brake shoe shafts 138 and 138 (one of which is not shown) and a camshaft 143 are attached. The brake shoe shafts 138 and 138 serve as swing shafts of a brake shoe (not shown) coming into contact with the inner face of the iron cast liner 128 of the drum 127. At one end of the camshaft 143, a cam 141 for moving the brake shoe toward the drum 127 side is formed. To the other end of the camshaft 143, an arm member 142 which swings in association with the braking operation is integrally attached. [0031]<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross section showing the wheel structure according to the invention and shows a state in which the axle 117, the stator 115 of the electric motor 116, brake shoe shafts 13 8 and 138 (one of which is not shown) of the drum brake 126, and the camshaft 143 are attached to the projection 135 of the rear swing arm 42, the wheel 68 is rotatably attached to the axle 117 via bearings 145 and 146, the drum 127 of the drum brake 126 is integrally formed in the disk 122 of the wheel 68, the magnet ring 106 for a sensor is attached to the disk 122 by using bolts 147 ..., and the rotary magnet member 112 is attached to the inner face of the rim 123. 148 denotes a collar, 151 and 152 denote dust seals, 153 indicates a washer, 154 indicates a nut, 155 indicates a return spring of the arm member 142, and 156 expresses an air valve of the tire.<br><br>
As described above, the wheel 68 is a motor built-in type wheel with a drum brake. [0032]<br>
FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a main portion on the front wheel side of the two-wheel vehicle according to the invention, and shows a state where the projection 135 is provided for the front swing arm 37, the brake shoe shaft 138 and the camshaft 143 are attached to the projection 135, and brake shoes 162 and 162 are swingably attached to the brake shoe shaft 138. 158 indicates a window provided in the upper part of the front swing arm 37, 161 indicates a projected piece to be inserted into the window 158 to integrally connect the front swing arm 37 to the lower arm 36, and 165 denotes an arm lock pin slidably attached to the front swing arm 37 so as to be connected to the projected piece 161.<br>
The brake shoes 162 and 162 are members also employed for the drum brake 126 shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. [0033]<br>
As described by referring to FIGS. 5 and 7, first, the invention is characterized in that, in the motor built-in type wheel structure in which the electric motor 116 for driving the wheel 68 is provided in the wheel 68 for vehicle, the drum brake 126 as a brake mechanism for braking the wheel 68 is disposed on the inside in the radial direction of the electric motor 116. [0034]<br>
The drum brake 126 and the electric motor 116 are separated from each other by the drum 127 of the drum brake<br><br>
126. Thus, wear powders of the brake shoe 162 are not adhered to the permanent magnets 107 and 108 of the electric motor 116, so that no influence is exerted on the performance of the electric motor 116, and the performance of the electric motor 116 can be therefore maintained. The electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 can be disposed concentrically, so that the width of the wheel 68 can be made narrow, and the small and compact wheel 68 can be achieved.<br>
Further, the influence of heat of the electric motor 116 is not exerted on the drum brake 126 because of the drum 127, so that the braking performance can be maintained. [0035]<br>
Second, the invention is characterized in that the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 are provided on the same side as the disc 122 of the wheel 68, that is, on the side facing the rear swing arm 42 of the disc 122. [0036]<br>
The electric motor 116 and drum brake 126 are provided on the same side of the disc 122 of the wheel 68, so that the magnet ring 106 for a sensor of the electric motor 166, rotary magnet member 112, brake shoe shaft 138 of the drum brake 126, camshaft 143, and the brake shoe can be assembled from the same side of the disc 122 to the wheel 68. Thus, the performance of assembling the electric motor 116 and drum brake 126 to the wheel 68 can be improved. [0037]<br>
In addition, maintenance on the electric motor 116 and drum brake 126 can be performed from the same side of the disc<br><br>
122, so that the performance of maintenance on the electric motor 116 and drum brake 126 can be improved. [0038]<br>
Third, the invention is characterized in that, as shown in FIG. 6, the drum brake 126 is used as a brake mechanism, and the rear swing arm 42 for rotatably supporting the wheel 68, more particularly, the projection 135 provided for the rear swing arm 42 is used as a member which serves as a brake panel of the drum brake 126 and to which the stator 115 of the electric motor 116 is attached. [0039]<br>
Since the rear swing arm 42 serves as the brake panel of the drum brake 126 and the member to which the stator 115 is attached, as compared with the case of specially providing a brake panel and an attaching member of the stator 115, the number of parts can be decreased, so that the cost of the parts can be suppressed. At the time of manufacture, the parts (such as the brake shoe shaft 138, brake shoe, camshaft 143, and arm member 142) of the drum brake 126 and the stator 115 can be sub-assembled to the rear swing arm 42.  Separately, the magnetic ring 106 for a sensor and the rotary magnet member 112 may be sub-assembled to the wheel 68. By attaching the sub-assembled wheel 68 to the sub-assembled rear swing arm 42, the productivity can be increased. [0040]<br>
Fourth, the invention is characterized in that, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the rotary magnet member 112 rotating integrally with the wheel 68 is provided for the electric motor<br><br>
116, the rotary magnet member 112 has the magnetic ring 111 and the permanent magnets 107 and 108 fixed to the magnetic ring 111, and the magnetic ring 111 is positioned to the wheel 68 by the positioning pin 133. [0041]<br>
By providing the wheel 68 with the rotary magnet member 112, for example, as compared with the case where a wheel is provided with a stator which takes the form of a coil, a slip ring mechanism for passing current to the stator and the like becomes unnecessary and the structure is simplified. By constructing the rotary magnet member 112 by the magnetic ring 111 and the permanent magnets 107 and 108 fixed to the magnetic ring 111, the magnetic ring 111 to which the permanent magnets 107 and 108 are preliminarily fixed can be attached to the wheel 68 . The assembly performance can be improved as compared with, for example, the case where the permanent magnets 107 and 108 are directly attached to the wheel 68.<br>
Further, by the positioning pin 133, the magnetic ring 111 can be prevented from rotating. [0042]<br>
Although the motor built-in wheel with a drum brake is employed as the rear wheel in the invention, the invention is not limited to the configuration. The motor built-in wheel with a drum brake may be employed as the front wheel or as front and rear wheels. The brake mechanism is not limited to the drum brake but may be a disc brake. [0043]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br><br>
The invention displays the following effects by the above-described configuration.<br>
In the wheel structure of Claim 1, the brake mechanism for braking the wheel is disposed on the inside in the radial direction of the electric motor. When the brake mechanism and the electric motor are separated from each other, the wear powders of the brake mechanism are prevented from exerting an influence on the electric motor, so that the performance of the electric motor can be maintained.<br>
The electric motor and the brake mechanism can be disposed concentrically, so that the width of the wheel can be reduced, and the small and compact wheel can be achieved. [0044]<br>
In the wheel structure of Claim 2, the electric motor and the brake mechanism are provided on the same side of a disc of the wheel.  Consequently, performance of assembling the electric motor and the brake mechanism to the wheel and performance of maintenance on the electric motor and the brake mechanism can be improved. [0045]<br>
In the wheel structure of Claim 3, the brake mechanism is a drum brake, and an arm member for rotatably supporting the wheel is a member which serves as a brake panel of the drum brake and to which a stator of the electric motor is attached. Therefore, as compared with the case of specially providing a brake panel and a member to which a stator is attached, the number of parts can be decreased, and the part cost can be suppressed.  Parts of the drum brake and the stator can be<br><br>
sub-assembled to the arm member at the time of manufacture. By attaching the wheel to the arm member to which the parts are sub-assembled, the productivity can be increased. [0046]<br>
In the wheel structure of Claim 4, the electric motor has a rotary magnet member rotating integrally with the wheel, the rotary magnet member has a magnetic ring and a permanent magnet fixed to the magnetic ring, and the magnetic ring is positioned in the wheel by a positioning pin.  Consequently, for example, as compared with the case where the wheel is provided with the stator which takes the form of a coil, a slip ring mechanism for passing current to the stator and the like becomes unnecessary and the structure is simplified.  By constructing the rotary magnet member by the magnetic ring and the permanent magnet fixed to the magnetic ring, the magnetic ring to which the permanent magnet is preliminarily fixed can be attached to the wheel. Therefore, the assembly performance can be improved as compared with the case of, for example, directly attaching the permanent magnet to the wheel.<br>
Further, by the positioning pin, the magnetic ring can be prevented from rotating.<br>
