				<td>RUBBER ROLL HUSKER<br>
The invention relates to a rubber roll husker, in particular for husking rice or cereals, preferably for separating out the raw husk.<br>
Generic rubber roll huskers are known from DE-C-2705334 and DE-C-2838518,  for example.  These have a pair of rubber rolls with pneumatically regulated contact pressure. The raw rice is fed centrally into the roll nip. The rolls are movably mounted and easy to replace. A frame that rotates around the drive roll, both rolls (belt pulleys) and a compensating roll achieves a constant belt tensioning until the rubber roll is worn out without having to retension. The drive speed is constant, so that the faster roll is subject to a higher rate of wear. To achieve a uniform wear on both rolls,  the latter must be switched repeatedly, resulting in a high maintenance and long downtimes. Roll diameter decreases at varying rates due to wear, so that the differential and circumferential speeds change to the • detriment of the husking process.<br>
This concept is also retained in a new husker according to EP-A-771590, as in EP-A-820814. The latter also discloses existing problems with a shifting of the roll nip due to rubber roll wear, so that the feeder position must be shifted given a constant location of the roll axes, in particular in cases where the grinding material must be supplied to the grinding nip very precisely, in only a few layers ,or only in a single layer. EP-A-820814 describes a roll wear and nip shifting of ± 10 mm, which would require a slide that could shift by ± 5 mm to supply the grinding material. Such a tracking device including controller is correspondingly expensive.<br>
In a rubber roll husker according to DE-A-19910337 of the applicant, each roll of the roll pair is allocated a drive<br>
motor, so that the speed of the rolls can be independently controlled. This rubber roll husker also exhibits opposing rockers with a jointly acting advancing and withdrawal device.<br>
The object of the invention is now to improve a generic rubber roll husker so that simple means can be used to achieve a uniform wear on both rubber rolls of a roll pair, independently design the feeder, and hence roll nip, and minimize temporary downtimes when switching the rolls.<br>
The object is achieved based on the features in claim 1. The rubber rolls are driven by separate motors and compact gearbox (e.g., a gearbox with integrated spur gear stage, containing a motor, transmission ratio, shaft bearing, and roll shaft), and can be driven and controlled independently of each other. The provided drives preferably have a speed that can be regulated, e.g., with a frequency converter. Each rubber roll operates faster or slower in intervals to achieve a uniform wear on both rubber rolls of the roll pair. As a result, standard rubber rolls can be completely worn before having to replace them. This eliminates the previous  allocation  of  rolls  (driven  and  co-rotating rolls). In addition, roll speed can be adapter to different diameters in order to achieve the optimum circumferential and differential speeds for a husking process.<br>
The subclaims disclose preferred embodiments. For example, mirror-image gearboxes can be sued for both rubber rolls, and the rocker levers secured to the gearbox so they can be swiveled around an axis, enabling them to give way under an overload. If the actuator is a linear motor, this takes place around the rotational axis with a spring attached, and,  when using pneumatic  cylinders,  they are  rigidly attached to the gearbox, since the air is compressible, should foreign bodies pass by the roll nip.<br>
Both rockers can be connected with a coupling rod. It is also possible to install a gearbox immovably in the casing of the rubber roll husker, and only have the second gearbox swivel.<br>
When adjusting the rolls with a spindle motor, roll adjustment can be realized without exposure to a response by husking forces.<br>
Hence, the roll or grinding nip is independent of the precision of grinding material supply, the position of the grinding nip remains nearly constant, eliminating the need for tracking the feeder, while still maintaining a high level of precision for the supply process. The variety of assemblies in different models is reduced.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below in an exemplary embodiment based on a drawing. The drawing shows:<br>
Fig. 1: The rubber roll husker according to the invention, diagrammatic;<br>
Fig. 2:   A side view of same.<br>
A rubber roll husker has a frame 1 (not explicitly shown), with a feeder 11, a pair of moving rubber rolls 2, 3 (not explicitly visible), and a product discharge. The rubber rolls 2, 3 are arranged with the respective drives as compact gearboxes in add-on rockers 6, 7. The compact gearboxes are provided top and bottom with symmetrical terminals, so that the gearboxes can mirror . each other right and left, and the add-on rockers 6, 7 and upper rocker levers can be connected. The add-on rockers 6, 7 are pivoted to the frame 1 at a fulcrum 8, 9, and interconnected by a coupling rod 10. The add-on rockers are mounted in the fulcrums 8, 9 via tapered roller bearings 11<br>
of pivoting bolts 12 in such a way as to minimize play and<br>
friction.<br>
The contact pressure of the rubber rolls 2, 3 can be controlled with an actuator, while the rolls 2, 3 are movably mounted.<br>
Each motor 4 has a frequency converter for continuous speed control.<br>
The cereals to be husked, rice in this case, are already largely isolated when supplied to the roll nip 13 via a metering element of the feeder.<br>
The husked rice exits the rubber roll husker via the product discharge along with the detached husks, which are separated out in a known manner further on in the process.<br>
