Method for manipulation identification on a sensor<br>
The invention relates to a method for identification of<br>
manipulation to an arrangement comprising a sensor which emits<br>
pulses and a recording unit.<br>
Particularly in the field of operating data recording for a<br>
commercial vehicle by means of a tachograph, it is essential to<br>
avoid manipulation on the basis of the original character of<br>
the recordings. In addition to the relevance of these<br>
recordings as evidence in legal disputes, the safety of the<br>
vehicle operation and labor-law aspects are also important<br>
here. With the new generation of digital tachographs in<br>
accordance with EU Order EU-VO 3821/85, these appliances are<br>
being developed against the requirement to reliably prevent<br>
manipulation of this new technology. One obvious method for<br>
deceitful manipulation of the recordings is the capability to<br>
modify, for example electromagnetically, the signal from a<br>
sensor which is generally fitted in the transmission area of<br>
the motor vehicle. For example, if the regularly pulsed signals<br>
from the sensor which are transmitted in real time could be<br>
delayed thus resulting in the recorded speed always being<br>
slower than the speed of travel.<br>
One object of the invention is thus to make it harder to<br>
manipulate the transmission of a signal which is correlated<br>
with the distance traveled and/or with the speed from a sensor<br>
which emits pulses to a recording unit.<br>
The invention proposes a method as claimed in claim 1 in order<br>
to achieve the object. The dependent claims contain<br>
advantageous developments of the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The method according to the invention is used particularly<br>
advantageously for personnel-related recording of data relating<br>
to the operation of a motor vehicle, when the recording unit is<br>
in the form of a tachograph and the sensor which emits pulses<br>
transmits a signal which is unambiguously correlated with the<br>
distance traveled by the vehicle to the recording unit or to<br>
the tachograph, since this application is subject to<br>
particularly stringent requirements for manipulation security.<br>
The sensor which emits pulses is in this case advantageously in<br>
the form of a Hall probe and interacts with a rotating<br>
transmission component which has projections and cutouts<br>
alternately, and in this way, the permeability in the vicinity<br>
of the Hall probe measurably changes a pulsed signal,<br>
preferably an approximately square-wave signal. The sensor<br>
accordingly transmits to the recording unit real time pulses<br>
whose period duration is unambiguously correlated with the<br>
rotation frequency of the corresponding transmission component,<br>
and is unambiguously correlated with the vehicle speed and the<br>
distance traveled. The method according to the invention<br>
achieves excellent manipulation security in that the<br>
measurement results of the sensor measurement are transmitted<br>
to the recording unit both as real time pulses and as data<br>
signals. For this purpose, the sensor has a corresponding<br>
evaluation unit which translates the real time pulses into data<br>
signals with more information content, and which are then<br>
transmitted to the recording unit in parallel with the real<br>
time pulses. According to the invention, such transmission is<br>
initiated by the recording unit, in particular by a data<br>
evaluation module in the recording unit, by means of a first<br>
request instruction, to which the sensor responds with the data<br>
signal. Because of the cyclic transmission of the first request<br>
instruction to the sensor, the data signal evaluation module in<br>
the recording unit can complete the measurement of the sensor<br>
by means of the data signals without any gaps. The real time<br>
pulses which are transmitted from the sensor to the recording<br>
unit in parallel with the data signal are received by the<br>
recording unit by means of a real time signal interface, and<br>
the number of these pulses is added to form a number of real<br>
time pulses. The data signal evaluation module uses a second<br>
request instruction to request the number of real time pulses<br>
from the real time signal interface at cyclic intervals, and<br>
compares the difference between the number of real time pulses<br>
relating to the current request to that of the previous request<br>
for the number of pulses, which the data signal evaluation<br>
determined from the cyclically transmitted data signals for the<br>
same time period.<br>
The data signal evaluation module thus always compares the<br>
numbers of real time pulses associated with the correct time<br>
interval for measurement with corresponding numbers of data<br>
signal pulses, and in order to ensure that there is no<br>
incorrect association during this process, the first request<br>
instruction and the second request instruction are transmitted<br>
offset by a specific time interval At. This time interval At is<br>
matched to the cycle of the first request instructions and of<br>
the time difference in the signal transmission between the real<br>
time signal on the one hand and the real time pulses and the<br>
data signal.<br>
The method according to the invention is particularly<br>
advantageous when the cyclic transmission of the data signal<br>
from the sensor to the recording unit takes place at regular<br>
time intervals, in particular at one-minute intervals.<br>
Approximately one-minute intervals have been found to be<br>
particularly advantageous since, particularly when using the<br>
method according to the invention for the recording function of<br>
a tachograph, with software in which the method is implemented<br>
being configured in a modular form in layers, the software<br>
modules can reliably complete one cycle during this time<br>
between the interfaces and the evaluation with respect to the<br>
processing and transmission of the real time signals and of the<br>
data signals.<br>
A layered structure of the method according to the invention<br>
and a corresponding implementation in such a manner that data<br>
signal evaluation is arranged in a layer which produces,<br>
receives and processes raw data, result in major advantages in<br>
the implementation and in the event of changes, with a second<br>
layer, which communicates with the first layer, looking after<br>
the transfer of data in such a way that data is transformed<br>
conformally in accordance with data transmission protocols, or<br>
is additionally also scrambled. A third layer, which<br>
communicates with the second layer, comprising, by way of<br>
example, a serial data interface and a real time signal<br>
interface, in this case expediently addresses a processor<br>
register and generates processor interrupts for processing of<br>
data streams. One component of the second layer is expediently<br>
a transfer module, which transforms the data signals from the<br>
data signal evaluation module to a form which is matched to the<br>
data transmission protocol, and accordingly transforms received<br>
data signals which conform with the protocol from the sensor to<br>
the recording unit back, for internal further processing in the<br>
recording unit.<br>
In order to prevent any manipulation, it is worthwhile for the<br>
recording unit to transmit the data signals to the sensor and<br>
for the sensor to transmit them to the recording unit in a<br>
scrambled form, and for a transfer module to be a component of<br>
the recording unit, which transfer module scrambles and<br>
descrambles data signals from the recording unit to the sensor<br>
and from the sensor to the recording unit, respectively. Real<br>
time pulses can expediently be transmitted from the sensor to a<br>
real time signal evaluation module essentially independently of<br>
this, without scrambling and without conforming with a data<br>
transmission protocol.<br>
The real time signal evaluation module which converts real time<br>
pulses (which have been transmitted from the real time signal<br>
point) in particular to information about speed when using the<br>
method for a tachograph, is advantageously connected for<br>
signaling purposes to the data signal evaluation module, to<br>
which the results of this evaluation are transmitted as a<br>
second data signal. Such transmission and communication between<br>
the real time signal evaluation module and the data signal<br>
evaluation module expediently take place asynchronously by<br>
means of a communication memory which is arranged between the<br>
two modules.<br>
In practice, it has been found to be worthwhile for the time<br>
interval between the first request instruction and the second<br>
request instruction to have a length of between 50 ms and<br>
300 ms. A time interval of between 147 ms and 172 ms allows the<br>
best stability to be achieved for the method according to the<br>
invention, as well as minimal susceptibility to faults, so that<br>
the data signal evaluation always associates the number of real<br>
time pulses with a correct number of data signal pulses, and<br>
arrives at the correct comparison results.<br>
In consequence, the invention will be explained in more detail<br>
using one specific exemplary embodiment and with reference to a<br>
drawing for illustrative purposes, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the method<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an arrangement comprising a tachograph DTCO and<br>
a sensor S. The tachograph DTCO is connected to the sensor S by<br>
means of a real time signal line RTL and a data line DL. Major<br>
components of the tachograph DTCO are a serial data signal<br>
interface DSI, a transfer module TM, a data signal evaluation<br>
module DSE, a communication memory PCM, a real time signal<br>
evaluation module RTSE and a real time signal interface RTI .<br>
The tachograph DTCO in this case carries out the function of a<br>
recording unit RM, according to the invention.<br>
At the start of a signal transmission process, the tachograph<br>
DTCO sends authentication data 70 to the sensor S, initiated by<br>
the data signal evaluation DSE, followed by a response request<br>
80. After successful authentication by both parties and the<br>
interchange of a session key, the tachograph DTCO and the<br>
sensor S start to transmit data related to the operation of the<br>
commercial vehicle, in accordance with ISO 16844-3. Every<br>
minute, the data signal evaluation module DSE uses a first<br>
request instruction 1.0 to initiate transmission of the<br>
measurement results from the sensor for the intermediate period<br>
as a data signal DS to the data signal evaluation module DSE.<br>
During this process, the method according to the invention<br>
operates in accordance with a layered implementation in such a<br>
way that the data signal evaluation module DSE transmits and<br>
receives the first request 1.0 and the data signal DS in the<br>
form of raw data, since the real time signal evaluation module<br>
RTSE, the communication memory KM and the data signal<br>
evaluation DSE are associated with a first layer l.L.<br>
First request instruction 1.0 is passed as raw data from the<br>
data signal evaluation module DSE to the transfer module TM,<br>
which is associated with the second layer 2.L. As an element in<br>
the second layer 2.L, the transfer module TM transforms the<br>
first request instruction 1.0 to a form in accordance with a<br>
data transmission protocol DSP.<br>
The data signals which conform with the protocol are also<br>
scrambled by the transfer module TM, and are passed to an<br>
element in a third layer 3.L for implementation of the method<br>
according to the invention, specifically to the data signal<br>
interface DSI. The third layer 3.L addresses a process register<br>
at the lowermost level and generates interrupts in particular<br>
for the data interchange with the sensor S. The first request<br>
instruction is in this way passed via the data signal interface<br>
DSI by means of the data line DL to the sensor S. A<br>
corresponding path in the reverse direction with essentially<br>
inverse processes is used to take the data signal DS emitted<br>
from the sensor to the data signal evaluation module DSE.<br>
Essentially independently of the processes D which are<br>
associated with the data signal DS and, illustrated<br>
schematically, are located on a side D, which is annotated D,<br>
of a boundary line G, processes which are associated with real<br>
time pulses RTS take place on the side RT, which is annotated<br>
RT, at the same time beyond this boundary line G. The sensor S<br>
uses the real time signal line RTL to send real time pulses RTS<br>
to the real time signal interface RTI.<br>
The real time signal interface RTI, which is located in the<br>
third layer 3.L, transmits corresponding signals RTS to the<br>
real time signal evaluation module RTSE, with the number of<br>
real time signals RTS being continuously added to the number of<br>
real time pulses RTSN.<br>
The data signal evaluation module DSE sends a second request<br>
instruction 2.0 to the real time signal interface RTI, with the<br>
interposition of the transfer module TM delayed by a specific<br>
time interval At with respect to the first request instruction<br>
1.0, specifically by about 147 ms to 172 ms, matched to the<br>
processes, which take place in the second layer 2.L and in the<br>
third layer 3.L, for transmission of the data signal DS and of<br>
the first request instruction 1.0, respectively. The real time<br>
signal interface RTI transmits the number of real time pulses<br>
RTSN directly to the data signal evaluation module DSE with a<br>
corresponding time offset with respect to the arrival of the<br>
data signal DS from the sensor S in the data signal evaluation<br>
module DSE.<br>
The data signal evaluation module DSE and the real time signal<br>
evaluation module RTSE interchange data asynchronously by means<br>
of the communication memory KM. The data signal evaluation<br>
module DSE compares the number of real time pulses RTSN with<br>
the number of data signal pulses DSN and, if there is a<br>
discrepancy between these two values that is greater than a<br>
specific no longer tolerable amount, sets a fault flag FF in<br>
the communication memory KM, and this fault flag FF is read<br>
there by the real time signal evaluation module RTSE. In this<br>
case, the fault flag FF is used as an indicator of manipulation<br>
and is passed to a recording memory R. At the same time,<br>
instead of the real time pulses RTS, the real time signal<br>
evaluation module RTSE receives the information from the data<br>
signal DS for determination of the distance traveled by the<br>
commercial vehicle.<br>
A discrepancy which is defined as a limit is permissible in the<br>
comparison of the number of real time pulses RTSN and the<br>
number of data signal pulses DSN, and the fault flag FF is set<br>
if this discrepancy is exceeded.<br>
Depending on the real time pulses RTS, the real time signal<br>
evaluation module RTSE transmits a motion signal V or a stop<br>
signal ST to the data signal evaluation module DSE.<br>
If the real time signal evaluation module RTSE transmits the<br>
stop signal ST to the data signal evaluation module DSE, the<br>
data signal evaluation module DSE signals that the vehicle is<br>
stationary.<br>
If the real time evaluation module RTSE does not transmit any<br>
signal V to the data signal evaluation module DSE in a<br>
situation in which the real time signal evaluation module RTSE<br>
identifies the "stop" state, and the real time signal interface<br>
RTI supplies an excessively low number of real time pulses<br>
RTSN = 0 in comparison to the number of data signal pulses DSN,<br>
the fault flag FF is set and the distance traveled, as<br>
determined from the data signal, is used as the basis for<br>
recording, and the state is confirmed that the connection by<br>
means of the real time signal line RTL is faulty.<br>
If the real time signal evaluation module RTSE transmits a<br>
signal V to the data signal evaluation module DSE in a<br>
situation in which the real time signal evaluation module RTSE<br>
identifies the "drive" state, and the real time signal<br>
interface RTI produces an excessively low number of real time<br>
pulses RTSN in comparison to the number of data signal pulses<br>
DSN, the fault flag FF is set and the distance traveled or<br>
speed of travel as determined from the data signal DS is used<br>
as the basis for recording.<br>
If the data signal DS is completely absent for the purposes of<br>
the cyclic request instructions 1.0, the fault flag FF is<br>
likewise set. and the state is confirmed that the connection by<br>
means of the data line DL is faulty.<br>

recorded that the connection by means of the data line<br>
(DL) is faulty.<br>
The invention relates to a method for identification of<br>
manipulations on an arrangement comprising a sensor (S) which<br>
emits pulses and a recording unit (RM) . Particularly in the<br>
case of a tachograph (DTCO), any possibility of manipulation<br>
must be overcome. For this purpose, the invention proposes that<br>
the sensor (S) transmits real time pulses (RTS) to the<br>
recording unit (RM) and, cyclically in response to first<br>
request instructions (1.0), transmits higher data signals (DS)<br>
for a measurement, and receives a number of real time pulses<br>
(RTSN) in response to second request instructions (2.0) which<br>
are offset in time with respect to the first request<br>
instructions (1.0). A data signal evaluation module (DSE)<br>
compares the number of real time pulses (RTSN) with the number<br>
of data signal pulses (DSN) and thus achieves a very high level<br>
of security against manipulation.</td>
