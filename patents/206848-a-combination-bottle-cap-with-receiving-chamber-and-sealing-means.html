				<td>TITLE: COMBINATION BOTTLE CAP BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to bottle caps and, more particularly to a combination bottle cap, which has an inside receiving chamber holding a filler, and sealing means sealing the filler in the inside receiving chamber.<br>
A mineral water or beverage bottle is capped with a bottle cap (see FIG. 8). The bottle cap has an inner thread adapted for threading onto the threaded neck of the bottle. This bottle cap is simply designed to close the bottle. Further, when drinking a bottle of coffee or sarsaparilla, one may add milk or salt to the bottle to change the taste of coffee or sarsaparilla. However, it is not convenient to carry milk or salt with a bottle of coffee or sarsaparilla outdoors.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to bottle caps and, more particularly to a combination bottle cap, which has an inside receiving chamber holding a filler, and sealing means sealing the filler in the inside receiving chamber.<br>
The invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. According to one aspect of the present invention, the bottle cap has at least one receiving chamber adapted to hold filler means. According to another aspect of the present invention, sealing means, for example, a foil flap is fastened to the bottle cap to seal filler means in each receiving chamber. According to another aspect of the present invention, the filler means can be salt, milk, fruit juice, or the like that matches the content of the bottle. Because the filler means is kept in the bottle cap, the user needs not to carry filler means separately. When opened, the user can add filler means to the bottle subject to the desired concentration. Further, the filler means can be a small gift to attract consumer to buy the bottled commodity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings.   Specific language will be used to describe same.   It will, nevertheless, be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a combination bottle cap in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown comprising a cap body 10 adapted for threading onto the threaded neck of a bottle a to close the bottle a. The cap body 10 comprises an inside receiving chamber 11, an inside annular flange 12, a filler 20 mounted in the inside receiving chamber 11, and a foil flap 21 fastened to the inside annular flange 12 to close the inside receiving chamber 11 and to keep the filler 20 in the inside receiving chamber 11. The type of the filler 20 is determined subject to the content contained in the bottle a. For example, the filler 20 can be milk powder for mixing in coffee contained in the bottle a.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the cap body 10 comprises an inside receiving<br><br>
chamber 11, an inside annular flange 12, a foil flap 14 fastened to the inside annular flange 12 to close the inside receiving chamber 11. Before fastening the foil flap 14 to the inside annular flange 12, a filler, for example, fluid sugar, milk, salt water, lemonade, fruit juice, medicine, etc., is filled in the inside receiving chamber 11.   After the cap body 10 had been disconnected from the bottle a, the user can open the foil flap 14 easily with the fingers or a pointed object, and then pull the filler out of the cap body 10 to the liquid contained in the bottle a. If the bottle a contains sarsaparilla, the filler can be salt or salt water. If the bottle contains mineral water, the filler can be lemonade or fruit juice.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the cap body 10 comprises a transverse partition wall 14, an inside receiving chamber 11 defined above the partition wall 14 and adapted to hold a filler, an inside annular flange 12 spaced above the partition wall 14, a foil flap 13 fastened to the inside annular flange 12 to close the inside receiving chamber 11, and a hinged closure 15 adapted to protect the foil flap 13 against outside dust. The hinged closure 15 has a finger strip 151 at the free end thereof.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the cap body 10 comprises a transverse partition wall 14, an inside receiving chamber 11 defined above the partition wall 14 and adapted to hold a filler, and a hinged closure 30 adapted to close the inside<br>
8<br><br>
receiving chamber 11.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the cap body 10 comprises a transverse partition wall 14, two receiving chambers 11 respectively defined above and below the partition wall 14, an inside annular flange 12 spaced below the partition wall 14, a foil flap 13 fastened to the inside annular flange 12 to close the bottom receiving chamber, and a hinged closure 30 adapted to close the top receiving chamber. Different fillers can be kept in the receiving chambers 11.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the cap body 10 comprises a transverse partition wall 14, two receiving chambers U respectively defined above and below the partition wall 14, an inside annular flange 12 spaced below the partition wall 14, a foil flap 13 fastened to the inside annular flange 12 to close the bottom receiving chamber, and an auxiliary cap 50 threaded onto the top end thereof to close the top receiving chamber. The auxiliary cap 50 comprises a top chamber 51 adapted to hold a filler, and a screw cap 40 threaded onto the top end thereof to close the top chamber 51.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the cap body 10 comprises a transverse partition wall 14, an inside receiving chamber 11 defined above the partition wall 14 and adapted to hold a filler, and a screw cap 40 threaded onto the top end thereof to close the inside receiving chamber 11.<br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or<br>
9<br><br>
two or more together may also find a useful application in other types of methods differing from the type described above.<br>
While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and described and are pointed out in the annexed claim, it is not intended to be limited to the details above, since it will be understood that various omissions, modifications, substitutions and changes in the forms and details of the device illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
