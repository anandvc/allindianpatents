PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE AMINE<br>
DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
production of an optically active amine derivative having<br>
high purity, wherein the formation of side products is<br>
suppressed.<br>
Background Art<br>
Although JP-A 11-140073 and JP-A 2002-212063 disclose<br>
a method for producing (S)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-<br>
indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine hydrochloride by means<br>
of asymmetric reduction from (E)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-<br>
indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-ylidene)ethylamine hydrochloride as<br>
starting material, both methods are not enough as an<br>
industrial production method in which the formation of side<br>
products is suppressed and high-purity crystals of (S)-2-<br>
(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine<br>
hydrochloride are produced with high yield. In particular,<br>
problems are to control the side products represented by<br>
the following formulae (III') and (IV').<br><br><br>
On the other hand, dimerization of benzofuran compound<br>
under the presence of Pd-catalyst is described in Liebigs.<br>
Ann. Chem., 10,945 (1989) and J. Chem. Soc. (A), 1324<br>
(1968). However, these cases are the dimerization by<br>
binding of two aromatic rings, and the structures of their<br>
dimers are different from those of dimers formed by the<br>
reaction between aromatic ring and benzyl position, like<br>
compound represented by the above formula (IV). In<br>
addition, J. Chem. Soc. D, 736 (1970) discloses that<br>
oxidation of benzyl position of benzofuran compound takes<br>
place under the presence of Pd-catalyst, but formation of<br>
dimer is not described therein.<br>

industrial process for production of an optically active<br>

problem, the present inventors found that in the steps of<br>
production of the optically active amine derivative, the<br>

pH and temperature of the reaction solution at the time of<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Examples of the salt of (S)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-<br>
indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine in the present invention<br>
include salts with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid, salts with an organic<br><br>
acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, and trifluoroacetic<br>
acid, and the like.<br>
In addition, (E)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-<br>
b]furan-8-ylidene)ethylamine which is a raw compound to be<br>
used for the production of (S)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-<br>
indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine or a salt thereof of the<br>
present invention can be produced by a method described in<br>
JP-A 2002-212063, that is, method of catalytically reducing<br>
4,5-dibromo-l,2,6,7-tetrahydro-8H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-one<br>
with catalytic reduction catalyst such as Pd-C, then<br>
reacting the obtained 1,2,6,7-tetrahydro-8H-indeno[5,4-<br>
b]furan-8-one with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate, followed<br>
by hydrogenating with cobalt catalyst, or analogous methods<br>
thereto.<br>
In the catalytic reduction step, catalytic reduction<br>
of 4,5-dibromo-l,2,6,7-tetrahydro-8H-indeno[5, 4-b]furan-8-<br>
one can be carried out by mixing 4,5-dibromo-l,2,6,7-<br>
tetrahydro-8H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-one, organic solvent,<br>
and if desired, a base, then preferably after displacing<br>
the system with nitrogen, adding catalytic reduction<br>
catalyst thereto, followed by pressurizing with hydrogen<br>
and stirring.<br>
Here, from the viewpoint of formation control of side<br>
product (specifically, dimer), it is preferred that the<br>
reaction should be carried out under the condition of<br><br>
hydrogen pressure and gas-liquid overall mass transfer<br>
volume coefficient, which meets the inequality:<br>
hydrogen pressure (MPa) &gt; -0.02 x gas-liquid overall mass<br>
transfer volume coefficient (1/hr) + 0.43.<br>
Herein, the gas-liquid overall mass transfer volume<br>
coefficient can be determined with Na2SO3 method as<br>
described in detail in the after-mentioned Example 1.<br>
Further, the hydrogen pressure in the present reaction<br>
is usually 0.1 to 1 MPa, preferably 0.3 to 0.5 MPa.<br>
In gas-liquid system, rate NA in which gas dissolves<br>
in solution per unit contact area can be expressed like in<br>
the case of dissolution rate in solid-liquid system,<br>
extraction rate in liquid-liquid system and transfer<br>
phenomenon in heat transfer by convection, and given in the<br>
form of (mass transfer coefficient) x (concentration<br>
difference).<br>
NA = KL(C1-C) (1)<br>
Here, KL is a mass transfer coefficient for liquid, C1 is a<br>
concentration which is in equilibrium with gas partial<br>
pressure in gas bubble and C is a saturated concentration<br>
at a given time, and (C1-C) is a driving force for gas<br>
absorption.<br>
In addition, given that A is a gas-liquid contact area<br>
and VL is a volume of liquid, since increasing rate VLdC/dt<br>
of gas concentration in solution is equal to dissolution<br><br>
rate of gas, the following equation can be given.<br>
NAA = VLdC/dt (2)<br>
Thus, equation:<br>
dC/dt = KLA(C1-C)/VL (3)<br>
is derived from formulae (1) and (2).<br>
Furthermore, given that A/VL is represented by a: gas-<br>
liquid interface area per unit area, equation:<br>
dC/dt = KLa(C1-C) (4)<br>
is given.<br>
Since it is difficult to obtain the gas-liquid<br>
interface area: a independently in gas-liquid stirring<br>
operation, mass transfer volume coefficient for liquid KLa<br>
which is a product of a and mass transfer coefficient for<br>
liquid KL is used as an index to express gas absorbability.<br>
In addition, from the fact that when stirring rate is<br>
increased, gas-liquid interface area: a becomes larger, it<br>
can generally be said that KLa becomes larger with stirring<br>
rate.<br>

reduction reaction is filtered to remove the catalyst, and<br>
treated using a method known per se (e.g., concentration,<br>
crystallization, recrystallization, chromatography, etc.)<br>
to give (S)-2-(1, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-<br>
yl)ethylamine.<br>
Furthermore, the resulting (S)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-<br>
2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine can be converted to a<br>
desired salt according to a conventional method.<br>
When the reaction and the post-treatment of the above-<br>
mentioned step (ii) are carried out without pH control,<br>
that is, under a strongly acidic condition below about pH 1,<br>
the above-mentioned benzofuran derivative (III1) is formed<br>
with about 5 to 10% and dihydrobenzofuran dimer (IV) is<br>
formed with about 0.2%, which are side products. In<br><br>
contrast, the production amount of these side products can<br>
be suppressed to below 0.07%, and to below 0.02%,<br>
respectively, by carrying out under the condition of pH 3<br>
to 9, preferably pH 5 to 7 of the present invention.<br>
The process for producing a crystal of (S)-N-[2-<br>
(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-<br>
yl)ethyl]propionamide of the present invention will be<br>
described below. The process is comprised of step (a) for<br>
propionylating the amino group of (S)-2-(1,6,7,8-<br>
tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine, and step<br>
(b) for crystallizing out of the reaction solution obtained<br>
in step (a). Namely, in step (a), the amino group of (S)-2-<br>
(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethylamine<br>
obtained in the above-mentioned process is reacted with a<br>
propionylating agent to propionylate. When the raw material,<br>
(S)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-<br>
yl)ethylamine is used in the form of salt, it is converted<br>
to free compound by a conventional method, followed by<br>
subjecting to propionylation reaction. Examples of the<br>
propionylating agent include propionyl halides such as<br>
propionyl chloride and propionyl bromide. The amount of<br>
propionylating agent to be used is a ratio of 1 - 2 mol to<br>
1 mol of (S)-2-(l,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-<br>
yl)ethylamine.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a solvent, and examples<br><br>
of the solvent include ethers such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
diethyl ether, dioxane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane, alcohols<br>
such as methanol, ethanol and propanol, hydrocarbons such<br>
as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane and hexane, amides such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, sulfoxides<br>
such as dimethylsulfoxide, and the like and a mixed solvent<br>
thereof, inter alia, tetrahydrofuran is preferred. The<br>
reaction time is usually 5 minutes to 48 hrs, preferably 30<br>
minutes to 6 hrs. The reaction temperature is usually -20<br>
to 200°C, preferably -10 to 50°C.<br>
In step (b), crystals of (S)-N- [2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-<br>
2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide	is<br>
crystallized by adding aqueous solvent to the reaction<br>
solution obtained in step (a) . Examples of the aqueous<br>
solvent include city water, pure water, purified water, etc.<br>
The amount of aqueous solvent to be added is a ratio by<br>
volume of 0.5 - 5 to the reaction solution obtained in step<br>
(a). The crystallization temperature is usually -20 to 60°C,<br>
preferably -10 to 40°C.<br>
The crystals of (S)-N-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-<br>
indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide is obtained with<br>
high yield of 97% by collecting the precipitated crystals<br><br>
by filtration. Highly pure crystals of (S)-N-[2-(1,6,7,8-<br>
tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5, 4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide<br>
can be obtained by further recrystallizing the obtained<br>
crystals from ethanol-water (1:2).<br>
Although the crystals of (S)-N-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-<br>
2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide obtained in<br>
the process of the present invention may have a possibility<br>
of containing the compounds represented by the following<br>
formulae (I) to (IV) as impurities (in the present<br>
specification, hereinafter, sometimes referred to as<br>
compound (I) to (IV), respectively), each content of the<br>
compounds (I) to (IV) is 0.15% by weight or less and<br>
further total content of the compounds (I) to (IV) is about<br>
0.20% by weight or less.<br><br>
For example, in the crystals of (S)-N-[2-(1,6,7,8-<br><br>
tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide obtained in the process<br>
of the present invention, the contents of compound (III) and (IV) are each below the<br>
detection limit of less than 0,02% by weight (HPLC), the content of compound (I) is<br>

compound (II) is about 0.02 to about 0.15% by weight, and further total content of<br>
the compounds (I) to (IV) is about 0.20% by weight or less.<br>

content of impurities, and as a result, improvement of crystallinity accompanied with<br>
improvement of purity, improvement of stability and the like are expected.<br>
Furthermore, when (S)-N-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-<br>

and cooled. Water (306 L) was added thereto under cooling,<br>
matured for 1 hr, and the precipitate was collected by<br>
filtration, followed by drying under reduced pressure to<br>

(3)	Gas-liquid overall mass transfer coefficient<br>
Here, the gas-liquid overall mass transfer coefficient<br>
was determined by Na2SO3 method.<br>
1) Na2SO3 method (sodium sulfite method)<br>
(a) Principle<br>
Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) , in an aqueous solution<br>
thereof, converts to sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) by reacting<br>
with oxygen which was incorporated from air. The reaction<br>
rate is sufficiently fast compared to absorption rate of<br><br>
oxygen (oxygen absorption is rate-determining step).<br>
Therefore, oxygen absorption rate (NA) can be obtained by<br>
measuring the concentration change of sodium sulfite.<br>
Now, the gas-liquid overall mass transfer volume<br>
coefficient KLa is defined by the following equation.<br>
NA = KLa(C*-C)<br>
Since actually in this measurement system,<br>
concentration of dissolved oxygen in the aqueous solution<br>
of sodium sulfite can be deemed as 0, the following<br>
equation is given.<br>
KLa = NA/C*<br>
On the other hand, solubility of oxygen in aqueous solution<br>
can be expressed by the following, using Henry's law.<br>
C* = p/H<br>
From these, KLa can be calculated.<br>
In addition, symbols in the above equation have the<br>
following meanings.<br>
KLa: gas-liquid overall mass transfer volume coefficient<br>
[1/Hr]<br>
NA: oxygen absorption rate [mol/L-Hr]<br>
C: oxygen concentration in liquid [mol/L]<br>
C*: solubility of oxygen in saturation [mol/L]<br>
p: partial pressure of oxygen in gas phase [Pa]<br>
H: Henry constant [Pa-L/Hr]<br>
(b) Measurement method<br><br>
(i) Pure water (475 ml, same liquid volume as feed scale of<br>
BIF 23.34 g) is charged into 1 L autoclave (Glass Reactor,<br>
TEM-V-1000 type).<br>
(ii) Na2SO3 (9.5 g) is added thereto, and mixed for about 2<br>
minutes to dissolve.<br>
(iii) A prepared 0.1 mol/L CuSO4 solution (4.75 ml) is<br>
added to the aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (CuSO4 concentration<br>
after the addition = 1x10-3 M) , and the reaction solution is<br>
stirred slowly for 1 minute (reaction initiation).<br>
(iv) Immediately, 10 ml of the dissolution solution is<br>
precisely sampled, and titrated according to the procedure<br>
of the following (c) . (titration volume = T1 [ml] )<br>
(v) The reaction solution is stirred with a given rotation<br>
rate for a given time ∆θ (= 1.0 [Hr] ) . At this time, a<br>
certain amount of air is streamed into the upper of the<br>
vessel to prevent decrease in partial pressure of oxygen in<br>
gas phase in autoclave (about 200 ml/L).<br>
(vi) 10 ml is precisely sampled from the solution of (v) ,<br>
and titrated according to the procedure of the following<br>
(c) . (titration volume = T2 [ml] )<br>
(vii) From the result of titration, oxygen absorption rate<br>
NA is calculated according to the following equation. Here,<br>
F represents a factor of N/10 iodine solution reagent.<br><br><br>
(c) Titration method (method for titration of sodium<br>
sulfite)*1<br>
(i) A 200 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing pure water (100 m),<br>
acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer*2 (10 ml) , and N/10<br>
iodine solution reagent (40 ml) is prepared beforehand,<br>
(ii) Sample solution (10 ml) is added thereto gently,<br>
(iii) After about 5 minutes, the sample solution is<br>
titrated with N/10 sodium thiosulfate solution using a<br>
starch solution*3 (0.5 - 1 ml) as an indicator.<br>
*1: Titration principle is based on that after<br>
oxidizing sulfite radical existing in the sample solution<br>
with iodine, the remaining iodine is titrated with sodium<br>
thiosulfate, and each step can be represented by the<br>
following reaction formula.<br>
oxidation of sulfite radical: Na2SO3 + I2 + H2O - 2NaI +<br>
H2SO4<br>
titration of iodine: I2 + 2Na2S2O3 - 2NaI + Na2S4O6<br>
*2: 75 g of sodium acetate (CH3COONa-3H2O) is dissolved<br>
in 500 ml of aqueous acetic acid (CH3COOH : H2O = 1 : 2) .<br>
*3: 1.0 g of starch is scrubbed and mixed with 10 ml<br>
of water, and the resulting mixture is fed into 200 ml of<br>
hot water. After boiling until this turns into semi-<br>
transparent, it is left to cool.<br>

ylidene)ethylamine hydrochloride<br><br>
To a mixed suspension of (E)-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-<br>
indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-ylidene)acetonitrile (10.0 g, 50.7<br>
mmol) in toluene (37.5 mL) and methanol (12.5 mL) were<br>
added activated cobalt (7.22 g) and 14.4% aqueous solution<br>
of potassium hydroxide (1.4 g), and stirred for 6.5 hrs at<br>
34 to 50°C under hydrogen atmosphere (0.2 MPa). The<br>
reaction solution was filtered, and to the filtrate were<br>
added toluene (170 mL) and methanol (35 mL) to separate the<br>
layers. 0. 5N Hydrochloric acid (101 mL) was added to the<br>
organic layer, and stirred for 30 minutes at 25 to 30°C.<br>
Then, the layers were separated, and active charcoal (1 g)<br>
was added to the aqueous layer, followed by stirring. The<br>
active charcoal was removed by filtration to give an<br>
aqueous solution of title compound (246 g, Net 12.0 g,<br>
yield 99.6%).<br>
Example 2<br>
(S)-2- (1,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-<br>
yl)ethylamine hydrochloride<br><br><br>
To an aqueous solution of (E)-2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-<br>
2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan-8-ylidene)ethylamine hydrochloride<br>
(1979 kg, Net 122kg, 513 mol) were added toluene (532 L)<br>
and 5% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (456 L) , and<br>
stirred. The layers were separated, and to the organic<br>
layer were added methanol (155 kg) and [RuCl (bebzene) (R)-<br>
BINAP]C1 (894 g) under nitrogen atmosphere, followed by<br>
stirring at 80°C for 15 hrs under hydrogen atmosphere (4.9<br>
MPa) . The reaction solution was cooled, and water (330 L)<br>
and concentrated hydrochloric acid (52.3 kg) were added at<br>
below 30°C, followed by stirring for 30 minutes, then the<br>
layers were separated. The aqueous layer was washed with<br>
toluene (195 L), and pH was adjusted to about 6.0 by adding<br>
5% aqueous solution of NaOH to the aqueous layer<br>
(containing 5.0% of compound III'). 5% Pd-C (50% wet, 9.7<br>
kg) was added thereto, and stirred at 60 °C for 6 hrs under<br>
hydrogen atmosphere (4.9 MPa). The reaction mixture was<br>
filtered, and the filtrate was adjusted to around pH 6.0<br>
with 5% aqueous solution of NaOH or dilute hydrochloric<br>
acid, followed by concentration under reduced pressure. The<br>
residue was recrystallized from mixed solution of n-butanol<br><br>
and water to give title compound (88.6 kg, yield 73.0%,<br>
compound (III') is not detected, compound (IV) is not<br>
detected).<br>
In addition, the content of compound (III') and<br>
compound (IV) (dimer) in the obtained crystals of the<br>
title compound was determined by HPLC under the following<br>
condition.<br>

were added 30% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (70 L)<br><br>
and propionyl chloride (32.8 kg), and stirred at room<br>
temperature for 1 hr. To the reaction solution was added<br>
city water (592 L) , and cooled. The precipitated crystals<br>
were collected by filtration, and dried under reduced<br>
pressure to give title compound (78.0 kg, yield 97.4%).<br>
(ii) Purification step<br>
The crystals (77.3 kg, 298 mol) obtained in (i) were<br>
dissolved in mixed solution (178 kg) of ethanol and<br>
purified water (10 : 1), and active charcoal (0.78 kg) was<br>
added thereto, then stirred for 10 minutes, followed by<br>
filtration (washed with mixed solution (74 kg) of ethanol<br>
and purified water (10 : 1) ) . To the filtrate was added<br>
water (588 L) under warming, cooled, and the precipitated<br>
crystals were collected by filtration, which were dried<br>
under reduced pressure. The resulting crystals were<br>
pulverized with jet mil to give title compound (74.0 kg,<br>
yield 95.7%, compound (I) 0.02%, compound (II) 0.06%,<br>
compound (III) and (IV) less than 0.02%, total analogous<br>
material 0.08%) .<br>
(iii) Analysis condition<br>
The content of compound (I) to (IV) in the crystals of<br>
