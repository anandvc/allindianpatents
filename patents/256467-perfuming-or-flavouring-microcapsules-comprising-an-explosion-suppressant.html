Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery and to the flavour industry.<br>
It concerns more particularly perfuming or flavouring microcapsules characterised by the<br>
fact that, when subjected to a sufficiently powerful ignition source, their rapid combustion<br>
reaction is weak or moderate. In fact, the microcapsules of the invention comprise an<br>
effective amount of a explosion suppressant susceptible of reducing the violence of their<br>
explosion, so as to classify these particles in a dust hazard class St-1.<br>
Background of the Invention and Problems to be Solved<br>
Microcapsules are employed to a large extent in the perfumery and flavouring<br>
industries. They constitute delivery systems for perfuming or flavouring ingredients and<br>
can be advantageously used in a very large number of applications. The encapsulation of<br>
active substances such as perfuming or flavouring ingredients provides at the same time a<br>
protection of the ingredients there-encapsulated against "aggressions" such as oxidation or<br>
moisture and allows, on the other hand, a certain control of the kinetics of flavour or<br>
fragrance release to induce sensory effects through sequential release.<br>
Now, the numerous advantageous properties of microcapsules in these fields are<br>
opposed to other properties that must be taken into account during their preparation,<br>
transportation, storage and handling. In fact, such delivery systems, due to their nature,<br>
and in particular to the fact that they encapsulate volatile and flammable substances,<br>
constitute combustible dusts which can, when dispersed in air or another oxygen-<br>
containing gas, form readily ignitable mixtures. When ignited by a sufficient powerful<br>
ignition source, the result is a rapid combustion reaction with advancing pressure and<br>
flame front.<br>
This issue becomes important during the preparation of microcapsules. In<br>
particular, spray-drying and fluidised-bed encapsulation processes are highly concerned<br>
by this issue, as they are both based on the use of an equipment wherein particles are<br>
suspended in hot air as fine particles and can therefore undergo explosion during their<br>
preparation.<br><br>
Spray-drying is the most common encapsulation technique used to stabilise<br>
volatile substances such as flavours or fragrances, by encapsulating them in a solid form,<br>
suited to many applications. Spray-dried powders are commonly made in an usual spray-<br>
drying equipment. Spray-drying is usually effected by means of a rotating disc or of<br>
multicomponent nozzles. Detailed techniques are described for instance in K. Masters,<br>
Spray-drying Handbook, Longman Scientific and Technical, 1991.<br>
Fluidised beds are used for spraying a coating on a core material fluidised in a<br>
bed, or agglomerating and/or granulating powders. This encapsulation technique is also<br>
well known and is described for instance in EP 70719 or in US 6,056,949, the contents of<br>
which are hereby included by reference.<br>
Both the above-described encapsulation equipments being susceptible to<br>
explosions of particles suspended in the air, they thus have to be adapted as a function of<br>
the technical safety parameters characterising the particles there-treated. In particular,<br>
they have to be dimensioned as a function of the violence of explosions that can occur<br>
during the preparation of microcapsules. Therefore, the problem of reducing the violence<br>
of possible explosions of powder products resulting from such encapsulation processes is<br>
of paramount importance for the industry.<br>
For the safe handling of combustible substances, it is imperative to know the<br>
dangerous properties of a product. The reliable way to characterise the combustible and<br>
explosive properties of a product is to subject a sample of the product to various tests and<br>
classify the results in accordance with the technical safety characteristics. The<br>
international standards (VDI Guideline 2263 part 1 : Dust Fires and Dust Explosions,<br>
Hazard Assessment - Protective Measures, Test Methods for the Determination of Safety<br>
Characteristics of Dusts, Beuth, Berlin, May 1990) describe the test equipments<br>
(Modified Hartmann apparatus and Close apparatus, 20-litre sphere apparatus) and<br>
methods, namely the ISO standard procedure ISO 6184/1. These methods allow to<br>
determine physical constants such as the maximum explosion behaviour of a combustible<br>
dust in a closed system. A pyrotechnic igniter with a total energy of 10 kJ is used as<br>
ignition source. From test methods described in the mentioned guidelines, a characteristic<br>
constant, KSt, which is dust specific is determined. As there are so many such dusts<br>
produced and processed in industrial practice, for example for pharmaceutical and cereal,<br>
flour products, it is appropriate to assign this maximum explosion constant to one of the<br>
several dust explosion classes and to use these as a basis for the dimensioning of<br><br>
constructional protective measures. The correspondence between these classes hereafter<br>
referred as dust hazard classes, and the constant K-st is the following :<br>
Dust Hazard Class	Product Specific Constant K-st [bar.m.s-1]<br>
St-1	0 to 199<br>
St-2	200 to 299<br>
St-3	&gt; 300<br>
Now, although some perfuming and flavouring ingredients are classified in a dust<br>
hazard class St-1, a large number of these ingredients and thus the microcapsules<br>
encapsulating them, and depending on the volatility of the perfuming or flavouring<br>
ingredients, are still classified under an St-2 dust hazard class and thus require production<br>
equipments specifically adapted to the violence of possible explosions, which of course<br>
can be very costly.<br>
WO 03/043728 A1 (FIRMENICH) discloses perfuming or flavouring<br>
microcapsules having fireproofing agents dispersed in or absorbed within a polymeric<br>
carrier material, whereby these fireproofing agents were basically inorganic salts. In view<br>
of these fireproofing agents, other agents suitable as explosion suppressants having<br>
further beneficial properties are needed. There is in particular a need of finding more<br>
efficient fireproofing agents, which can be used with similar efficiency in smaller<br>
amounts, and there is a need of fireproofing agents that have a beneficial effect on the<br>
hygroscopicity of the perfuming or flavouring microcapsules, notably it would be an<br>
advantage to have a fireproofing agent that reduces hygroscopicity of the perfuming or<br>
flavouring microcapsules if compared to fireproofing agents of the prior art. In addition,<br>
the fireproofing agents disclosed in WO 03/043728 are not always suitable for use in food<br>
applications and other solutions have thus to be found.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Remarkably, we have been able to establish that new explosion suppressants being<br>
C1-C12 carboxylic acids, salts of C1-C12 carboxylic acids, and mixtures thereof could be<br>
added directly to perfuming and flavouring microcapsules in an amount effective to<br>
reduce the violence of possible explosions during their preparation, in particular when<br><br>
suspended in hot air. The K.St constant of microcapsules comprising the new explosion<br>
suppressants could thus be effectively reduced. Very surprisingly, these new explosion<br>
suppressants also reduce the hygroscopicity of powders comprising the microcapsules of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Therefore, in a first aspect, the present invention provides perfuming or flavouring<br>
microcapsule comprising at least one perfuming or flavouring ingredient dispersed in or<br>
adsorbed within a polymeric carrier material, characterised in that the microcapsule<br>
further comprises an effective amount of a explosion suppressant selected from the group<br>
of C1-C12 carboxylic acids, salts of C1-C12 carboxylic acids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides methods for the preparation of<br>
perfuming or flavouring compositions according to the invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a explosion<br>
suppressant selected from the group consisting of C1-C12 carboxylic acids, salts of C1-C12<br>
carboxylic acids, and mixtures thereof in the composition of a microcapsule for reducing<br>
the violence of the explosion of the microcapsule.<br>
In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a method for reducing<br>
explosivity of a powdered composition, the method comprising the step of<br>
-	adding to the powdered composition a fireproof agent selected from the group<br>
consisting of C1-C12 carboxylic acids, salts of C1-C12 carboxylic acids, and mixtures<br>
thereof to the powdered composition, and/or,<br>
-	incorporating the fire proof in and/or within particles of the powdered composition,<br>
and/or,<br>
-	coating the fire proof agent onto the powdered composition.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides perfumed product and a food,<br>
beverage or pharmaceutical product, characterised in that it comprises the flavouring<br>
and/or perfuming microcapsule of the present invention.<br>
As mentioned above, the St-class of a microcapsule is deduced from the value of<br>
its product specific constant K.st (see correspondance Table above). The K.st parameter is<br>
measured by means of the ISO standard procedure ISO 6184/1 in a 201 sphere apparatus.<br>
This equipment and the methods of measurement of K.st are described in International<br>
standards, hereby included by reference (VDI Guideline 2263 part 1 : Dust Fires and Dust<br>
Explosions, Hazard Assessment - Protective Measures, Test Methods for the<br>
Determination of Safety Characteristics of Dusts, Beuth, Berlin, May 1990).<br><br>
The perfuming or flavouring microcapsules of the invention comprise an effective<br>
amount of a explosion suppressant which is capable of reducing the violence of the<br>
explosion of the microcapsules possibly induced by their suspension in the air during their<br>
preparation. This is very advantageous considering that such delivery systems are mainly<br>
composed of highly volatile ingredients which constitute therefore combustible dusts.<br>
Such volatile ingredients had to be used in the past in limited proportions in compositions<br>
subjected to processes involving the suspension of particles in hot air. Now, the solution<br>
provided by the present invention allows to use higher quantities of these ingredients, and<br>
therefore provides an advantageous alternative to the prior use of precursors of certain<br>
particularly volatile ingredients.<br>
The invention therefore provides an advantageous solution as regards the problem<br>
of the preparation of perfuming and flavouring microcapsules and powder products, in<br>
particular for preparations via processes involving a spray-drier or a fluidised bed,<br>
wherein fine particles are suspended in the air and are therefore more susceptible of<br>
exploding. Under an St-1 class, the violence of the explosion will be a weak or at least<br>
moderate reaction, whereas it would be a strong reaction for a dust hazard class St-2, and<br>
a very strong reaction for a dust hazard class St-3. As a consequence, the equipment used<br>
for the preparation of microcapsules according to the present invention can be<br>
dimensioned accordingly i.e. as St-1 and thus become less costly, whilst guarantying the<br>
same or better manufacture safety conditions.<br>
The term C1-C12 carboxylic acids refers to carboxylic acids that have 1 to<br>
12 carbon atoms, including the C-atom of the carboxyl group. Therefore, if more than one<br>
carboxylic group are present in the carboxylic acid of the present invention, these further<br>
carboxylic group are, equally, to be counted to the 1 to 12 carbon atoms of the carboxylic<br>
acid used as a explosion suppressant according to the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acids and/or their salts that are used as explosion<br>
suppressants in microcapsules of the present invention are linear, branched, cyclic, and/or<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids and/or their salts. The carboxylic acids may be saturated<br>
hydrocarbons. Alternatively, the carboxylic acids may be unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Examples of cyclic carboxylic acids are lactones, for example ascorbic acid. An<br>
example for an aromatic carboxylic acid is salicylic acid.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acids and/or their salts are functionalised hydrocarbon<br>
carboxylic acids and/or their salts.<br><br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acid comprise less than 7, more preferably less than 5<br>
and most preferably less than 3 carbon atoms covalently bound to 2 hydrogen atoms.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acid of the present invention comprises 5 or less carbon<br>
atoms with an oxidation number of (-II) or more negative. More preferably, the<br>
carboxylic acid comprises 3 or less carbon atoms having a oxidation number of (-II) or<br>
more negative.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the carboxylic acids and/or their salts<br>
are hydroxy- and/or ceto-functionalised hydrocarbon carboxylic acids and/or their salts.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acid of the present invention comprises at least 1 hydroxy<br>
group. Preferably, it comprises at least 2 hydroxy groups.<br>
In a further embodiment of the microcapsules of the present invention, the<br>
carboxylic acids and/or their salts are di-, tri-, or multi carboxylic acids and/or their salts.<br>
Examples of multi carboxylic acids include citric acid, which is C6-tricarboxylic acid.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acid is at least a di carboxylic acid. More preferably, it<br>
is at least a tri carboxylic acid, meaning that it carries at least three carboxylic groups.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acid and/or their salt is a C4-C8 carboxylic acid and/or<br>
their salt.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the carboxylic acid and/or<br>
their salts are selected from C2-C6 carboxylic acids and/or their salts.<br>
In an embodiment of the perfuming or flavouring microcapsule of the present<br>
invention, the carboxylic acid and/or its salt is selected from the group consisting of acetic<br>
acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, citric acid,<br>
succinic acid, hydroxysuccinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, oxylic acid, glyoxylic<br>
acid, adipic acid, lactic acid, lactic acid, tartric acid, salicylic acid, ascorbic acidthe<br>
potassium, calcium and/or sodium salts of any of the fore-mentioned acid, and mixtures<br>
of any of these.<br>
Preferably, the salts of the carboxylic acids are potassium and/or sodium salts.<br>
More preferably, it is the tripotassium and/or trisodium salt of a tricarboxylic acid. Most<br>
preferably, it is the tripotassium and/or trisodium salt of citric acid.<br>
The above acids and their salts are commercially available and their synthesis, or<br>
isolation from raw materials, is known to the skilled person.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the microcapsule comprises from 0.5<br>
to 80% by weight of explosion suppressant relative to the dry weight of the microcapsule.<br>
Preferably, the microcapsule comprises 1 to 40%, more preferably 2 to 20%), and most<br>
preferably 2 to 10% by weight of explosion suppressant relative to the dry weight of the<br>
microcapsule.<br>
The microcapsule of the invention is based on the presence of at least one<br>
perfuming or flavouring material and a polymeric carrier material.<br>
The perfuming or flavouring ingredient, in the form of one sole ingredient or in<br>
the form of a composition, either in isolation or, optionally, in a solution or suspension in<br>
solvents and adjuvants of current use, represents from 1 to 70%, and preferably from 15<br>
to 60%, most preferably 20 to 45% by weight relative to the total weight of the<br>
microcapsule.<br>
The terms perfume or flavour ingredient or composition as used herein are<br>
deemed to define a variety of fragrance and flavour materials of both natural and<br>
synthetic origins. They include single compounds and mixtures. Specific examples of<br>
such components may be found in the current literature, e.g. in Perfume and Flavour<br>
Chemicals by S. Arctander, Montclair, N.J. (USA); Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavour<br>
Ingredients, CRC Press or Synthetic Food Adjuncts by M.B. Jacobs, van Nostrand Co.<br>
Inc., and other similar text books ; and are well-known to the person skilled in the art of<br>
perfuming, flavouring and/or aromatising consumer products, i.e. of imparting an odour<br>
or a taste to a consumer product.<br>
According to the present invention, the perfume or flavour ingredient or<br>
composition is dispersed in, coated onto or absorbed in a carrier material.<br>
Preferably, the carrier material comprises carbohydrates. For example, the carrier<br>
material comprise mono-, oligo- and/or polysaccharides, wherein the prefixes oligo- and<br>
poly are as defined below.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the carrier material comprises a<br>
monomelic, oligomeric or polymeric carrier material, or mixtures of two or more of these.<br>
An oligomeric carrier is a carrier wherein 2-10 monomeric units are linked by covalent<br>
bonds. For example, if the oligomeric carrier is a carbohydrate, the oligomeric carrier<br>
may be sucrose, lactose, raffinose, maltose, trehalose, fructo-oligosaccharides, to name a<br>
few examples only.<br><br>
Examples of a monomelic carrier materials are glucose, fructose, mannose,<br>
galactose, arabinose, fucose, sorbitol, mannitol, for example.<br>
Polymeric carriers have more than 10 monomeric units that are linked by covalent<br>
bonds. Non limiting examples of the latter include polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
dextrines, maltodextrines, natural or modified starch, vegetable gums, pectins, xanthanes,<br>
alginates, carragenans or yet cellulose derivatives such as for example carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, methylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose, and generally all materials currently<br>
used for encapsulation of volatile substances. Preferably, the polymeric carrier comprises<br>
maltodextrin. Most preferably it comprises maltodextrin and modified starch, such as, for<br>
example, alkenyl-succinated starch.<br>
In another embodiment, the perfume or flavour ingredient or composition is<br>
adsorbed within a polymeric carrier material. As non limiting examples of the latter, one<br>
can cite amorphous silica, precipitated silica, fumed silica and aluminosilicates such as<br>
zeolite and alumina.<br>
According to an aspect, the present invention provides methods for the preparation<br>
of perfuming and flavouring microcapsules comprising a explosion suppressant. There are<br>
several alternatives to the method for the preparation of the microcapsules of the<br>
invention. In a first embodiment, the explosion suppressant is added to an aqueous<br>
emulsion consisting of the perfuming or flavouring ingredient or composition dispersed in<br>
the polymeric carrier material. The obtained emulsion is then spray-dried in order to form<br>
a powder. Optionally, an emulsifier may be added to the initial emulsion. This<br>
encapsulation technique does not require a more detailed description herein, as it relies on<br>
conventional spray-drying techniques, which are perfectly well documented in the prior<br>
art [see for example Spray-Drying Handbook, 3rd ed., K. Masters ; John Wiley (1979)]<br>
and currently applied in the food industry or in the flavour and perfume industries.<br>
In another embodiment, the explosion suppressant, in the form of a solid powder,<br>
is simply blended with a spray-dried powder formed from the aqueous emulsion of<br>
perfuming or flavouring ingredient or composition in the polymeric carrier material and<br>
the emulsifier.<br>
A third alternative for the preparation of the microcapsules of the invention<br>
presenting an explosion reaction of reduced violence, is to firstly adsorb the perfuming or<br>
flavouring ingredient or composition within a porous polymeric carrier material as<br>
described above and to further coat the resulting system with a explosion suppressant.<br><br>
This method of preparation can be carried out in a fluidised bed apparatus, according to<br>
conventional techniques such as those described for instance in EP 70719 or in<br>
US 6,056,949 the contents of which are hereby included by reference. The particles<br>
formed by adsorption of a fragrance or flavour ingredient or composition within the<br>
carrier can thus be coated after granulation, e.g. by spraying a solution, emulsion or melt<br>
of the explosion suppressant, which forms a protective film around the core.<br>
During the granulation process, there can also be used usual additives such as<br>
artificial sweeteners, food dyes, vitamins, antioxidants, anti-foam agents, carbonic acid<br>
generators, or additional flavorants etc. which can be added to the core material or to the<br>
spray emulsion.<br>
The microcapsules of the invention have an average diameter varying from<br>
usually 5 to 800 µm, more preferably 50 to 300 µm.<br>
In an aspect, the present invention provides a method for reducing violence of<br>
explosion of a powdered composition. The composition is preferably a perfuming or<br>
flavouring composition. More preferably, it is a composition comprising flavouring<br>
perfuming and/or perfuming microcapsules. Violence of explosion is determined by the<br>
K.st constant described above. The adding of the explosion suppressant to a powdered<br>
composition may be performed by adding to a spray-dried powdered. However, any way<br>
of dry- or wet-adding the explosion suppressant to a powdered composition is<br>
encompassed. For example, the adding is a dry-blending or dry-mixing with the<br>
components of the powdered composition. Alternatively, the explosion suppressant may<br>
be incorporated in and/or within the particles of a powdered composition. This step may<br>
be performed by adding the explosion suppressant to an aqueous emulsion dispersed in a<br>
polymeric carrier material as described above, followed by drying the obtained emulsion,<br>
for example by spray drying.<br>
In a further alternative, the explosion suppressant may simply be coated onto a powdered<br>
composition. The coating may be performed by coating onto a porous polymeric carrier<br>
material, for example with a fluidised bed apparatus, as discussed above, for example.<br>
The microcapsules of the invention can advantageously be used to impart,<br>
improve, enhance or modify the organoleptic properties of a great variety of edible or<br>
perfumed end products. In the field of perfumery, the perfuming microcapsules resulting<br>
from any embodiment of the process according to the invention can be incorporated in a<br>
perfuming composition such as a perfume, a Cologne or an after-shave lotion, or yet they<br><br>
can be added to functional products such as detergents or fabric softeners, soaps, bath or<br>
shower gels, deodorants, body lotions, shampoos and other hair-care products, household<br>
cleansers, cleaning and deodorising blocks for toilet tanks. On the other hand, in the case<br>
of flavours encapsulated, the consumer products susceptible of being flavoured by the<br>
microcapsules of the invention may include foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals and the<br>
like.<br>
The concentrations in which the microcapsules of the invention can be<br>
incorporated in such consumer products vary in a wide range of values, which are<br>
dependent on the nature of the product to be perfumed or flavoured. Typical<br>
concentrations, to be taken strictly by way of example, are comprised in a range of values<br>
as wide as from a few ppm up to 5 or 10% of the weight of the flavouring or perfuming<br>
composition or finished consumer product into which they are included.<br>
The invention will be now illustrated but not limited by way of the following<br>
examples wherein temperatures are given in degrees centigrade and abbreviations have<br>
the meaning common in the art.<br>

In Examples 1- 9 given in Table 1, stabilizers were first dissolved in the perfume.<br>
The remaining ingredients were homogenised with an equivalent amount of water and<br>
then the perfume was emulsified in this dispersion by means of a Silverstone type fast<br>
stirrer. The mixtures were then spray dried in a Sodeva apparatus with an emulsion output<br>
of 2 kg/h, drying air: 320 m3/h at 350°C and 0.45xl05 Pa.<br>
There were thus obtained 9 fine powders comprising microcapsules, the diameter<br>
of the microcapsules being comprised between 10 and 100µm and the content of liquid<br>
perfume being 36-40% by weight.<br>
The explosive character of the powders was measured with a 20 1 sphere apparatus<br>
(see VDI Guideline 2263 part 1 : Dust Fires and Dust Explosions, Hazard Assessment -<br>
Protective Measures, Test Methods for the Determination of Safety Characteristics of<br>
Dusts, ISO standard procedure ISO 6184/1, Beuth, Berlin, May 1990), and the powders<br>
were attributed dust hazard classes St-1 (Examples 1-8, comprising fireproof agents),<br>
and St- 2-3 (Example 9, no fireproof agent), see details in Table 1.<br>
From Table 1 it can be seen that citric acid, sodium and potassium citrate<br>
effectively reduced explosive violence of the microcapsules. The most effective explosion<br>
suppressant was potassium citrate, which was added at 5% of the composition and which<br>
reduced explosivity to 119 Kst (perfume B) and 132 Kst (perfume A), respectively.<br>
Potassium citrate had thus the same, or even better reducing effect on violence of<br>
explosion than the explosion suppressant of the prior art (WO 03/043728), mono-sodium<br>
phosphate, which was used at much higher concentrations (15wt.-%, Example 9).<br>
In conclusion, the new explosion suppressants of the present invention can reduce<br>
the violence of explosion of perfuming microcapsules and are effective at substantially<br>
lower concentration than explosion suppressant used in similar compositions from the<br>
prior art.<br><br><br><br>
Example 10<br>
Hygroscopy of new explosion suppressants in comparison with the prior art<br>
Hygroscopicity (the tendency to absorb water) of the microcapsules of Examples 5<br>
(present invention) and 7 (prior art) is determined in a Dynamic Vapor Sorption,<br>
commercialised by Surface Measurements Systems Ltd, 3 Warple Mews, Warple Way,<br>
London, W3 ORF, at increasing relative humidity (40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%) to<br>
determine the "melting" point of the two powders at 30°C. The "melting point", in the<br>
context of the present Example 10, refers to the relative humidity at which a powder has<br>
absorbed so much water that it loses its powdery aspect and starts to flow like a liquid,<br>
that is, it "melts". The specific relative humidity at which this happens can be determined<br>
due to the observation of the powder during the water-absorption from humid air by aid of<br>
a camera.<br>
The perfuming microcapsules of Example 5, comprising 5% of potassium citrate<br>
"melts" at a relative humidity of 80% RH, while the perfuming powder of Example 7<br>
(prior art) already "melts" at 60% RH. In additional test, a powdered perfuming<br>
composition comprising 15% potassium citrate was prepared, which was found to "melt"<br>
at 70% RH.<br>
The difference in hygroscopicity in powders comprising microcapsules of the<br>
present invention can be attributed, without being bound by theory, first to the fact that<br>
potassium citrate leads to less hygroscopicity powders than sodium phosphate. In<br>
addition, less of the explosion suppressant needs to be used, which further reduces<br>
hygroscopicity of the powder. In conclusion, the present invention surprisingly provides<br>
powdered perfuming compositions that withstand very humid environments of up to 80%<br>
RH at 30°C.<br>
Example 11<br>
Based on the composition of the perfuming microcapsules given below,<br>
microcapsules are prepared by dry blending a spray dried powder comprising polymeric<br>
carrier and a perfuming ingredient with a explosion suppressant in a powdered form.<br><br>

The theoretical yield after evaporation of water is of 100 g of powder containing<br>
33% of perfume.<br>
The explosive character of the powder is measured with a 201 sphere apparatus<br>
(see Examples 1-9), and the powder was attributed a dust hazard class St-2.<br>
The same powder is then mixed with potassium citrate (K3 citrate x 1H2O) in a<br>
powder form, in a ratio of 85:15.<br>
The analysis of the explosive character of the homogeneous mixture, made under<br>
the same condition demonstrated that the mixture is classified as St-1.<br><br><br>
