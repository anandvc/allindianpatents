TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"NEW POLYMORPH OF TEMZOLAMIDE AND PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Ahmedabad -380 015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   present   invention   relates  to  an   improved   process   for  the   preparation  of Temozolomide. The present invention also relates to novel crystalline form X of crude Temozolomide. The crystalline form X of crude Temozolomide is a solvated form of Temozolomide, and preferably a DMSO solvate. BACKGROUNG OF THE ART<br>
Temozolomide (also known as 3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,l-d]-l,2,3,5-<br>
tetrazine-8-carboxamide;	8-carbamoyl-3-methyiimidazo[5,1 -d]-1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4(3H)-one;<br>
methazolastone; M &amp; B 39831 ; CCRG-81045; NSC-362856; Temodal; Temodar) is a well known anti-neoplastic agent that acts as an alkylating agent. Its primary application is in the treatment of brain cancer (e.g., glioma). Temozolomide is indicated in the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma, a form of brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme and metastatic melanoma.<br>
Temozolomide is a prodrug, being cleaved in a multi-step pathway firstly to liberate an unstable monomethyl triazeno Imidazole carboxamide (MTIC), which then suffers proteolytic fragmentation to generate a highly-reactive methylating agent (methanediazonium ion) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (see, e.g., Arrowsmith et al, 2002, J. Med. Chem. Vol. 45, pp. 5458-5470).<br>
TMZ is the abbreviation commonly used for a compound having the chemical name 3,4-dihydro-3- methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,l-d]-l,2,3,5-tetrazine-8-carboxamide or 3-methyl-8-amino carbonyl-imidazo [5,l-d]-l,2,3,5-tetrazin-4(3H)-one. It has the following structure.<br>
 <br>
Formula (I)<br>
It is described in US 5260291 together with compounds of broadly similar activity such as higher alkyl analogs at the 3-position. Also described therein is a process for the preparation of Temozolomide and its derivatives involving condensation of 5-diazo-5H-imidazole-4 carboxamide (and related compounds) with an isocyanate. However, the process described is very slow, involving reaction times of up to 3 weeks.<br>
J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 196-201 describes a process wherein 5-amino-lH-imidazole-4-carboxamide is converted into 5-diazo-lH-imidazole-4-carboxamide, which is then cyclised with methyl isocyanate in dichloromethane. However, the cycloaddition of Methyl isocyanate (MIC)<br>
 <br>
requires a long reaction time i.e. 20 days and also it is essential to limit dichloromethane content in the final API below 600 ppm as per ICH guideline.<br>
US 2002/0133006 discloses a process for the preparation of compound of formula (I) using methyl hydrazine which is a toxic and flammable liquid, hence not feasible on industrial scale and the final isolation involves tedious workup including column chromatography. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 7288-7294 describes a process wherein the final step of diazotization provides equal-formation of aza-hypoxanthine and Temozolomide, resulting in low yield. This literature does not provide the experimental procedure for work up.<br>
US 2005/0131227 describe a process involving the use of a bulky protecting group on nitrogen of the primary amide for cyclisation in presence of LiCl to minimize the undesired cyclisation product. After cyclisation the protecting group has to be removed which makes the process more laborious with more number of steps.<br>
US 2007/0225496 describes a process for the preparation of Temozolomide comprising pyrrolysing N'-methyl-N,N-diphenyl urea to form Methyl isocyanate (MIC) vapour and slowly condensing the Methyl isocyanate (MIC) vapour into a reservoir of a solution of 5-diazo-5H-imidazoIe-4-carboxamide in dimethyl sulphoxide. A yield of crude Temozolomide of 68.6% is reported. During filtration of the crude Temozolomide produced in this process, excess Methyl isocyanate (MIC) vapors may be released to the atmosphere.<br>
US 2480088 discloses a process for the preparation of Methyl isocyanate (MIC) comprising the conversion of N-methyl carbamoyl chloride (NMCC) by using toluene in the presence of pyridine.<br>
However, US4082787 also disclosed the process for the preparation of Methyl isocyanate (MIC) but a drawback associated with this process is that it is not possible to charge whole of the raw material in one slot and the process also required column for final distillation.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the compounds described in US5260291 can be prepared by a new process developed under the present invention that avoids many of the problems encountered in the prior art.<br>
The process of the present invention is a convenient process for the preparation of Temozolomide with desired purity and yield by using better preparation techniques, which are eco-friendly, cost-effective, robust and well suited for use on an industrial scale. The US 2007/0225496 patent describes the process for the preparation of Temozolomide comprises of pyrrolysing N'-Methyl-N,N-diphenyl urea to form Methyl isocyanate (MIC) vapour which slowly condenses the Methyl isocyanate (MIC) vapour into a reservoir of a solution of 5-diazo-lH-imidazole-4-carboxamide in dimethyl sulphoxide whereby they have employed 300 Â°C temperature for pyrolysis.<br>
 <br>
The inventors of the present invention have come out with a unique process whereby MIC is prepared by using N-methyl carbamoyl chloride (NMCC) and does not employ that much of higher temperature as mentioned in prior art. The present process is thus found to be more industrially feasible as compared to the conventional processes for the preparation of Temozolomide.<br>
It is well known that pharmaceutical solids can exist in different physical forms. Polymorphism is often characterized as the ability of a drug substance to exist as two or more crystalline forms that have different arrangements and/or conformations of the molecules in the crystalline lattice.<br>
These polymorphs differ in internal solid state structure, and, therefore, possess different chemical and physical properties, including packing, thermodynamic, spectroscopic, kinetic, interfacial, and mechanical properties. These properties can have a direct impact on drug product quality/performance, including stability, dissolution, therapeutic efficacy and bioavailability. Some of these forms may or may not be suitable therapeutically, but may have important benefits as being suitable as intermediates to obtain the therapeutically active form in better yield, purity etc. Therefore, such alternate forms have their utility as intermediates and are therefore are attractive commercially. We herein disclose such alternate forms having one or more of the above advantages, in addition/alternate to the known utility of the base and salt.<br>
The most stable polymorphic form of a drug substance is often used in a formulation because it has the lowest potential for conversion, from one polymorphic form to another. On the other hand, metastable and even amorphous forms may be chosen to enhance the bioavailability of the drug product. An amorphous form, being a disorganized solid mass, does not need to lose crystal structure before dissolution in the gastric juices, and, thus, often has greater bioavailability than a crystalline form. Further, such forms can be used for obtaining the stable form/marketed form.<br>
The preparation of new crystalline form of active pharmaceutical ingredients provides opportunities to improve the performance characteristics of a pharmaceutical product. Such preparation enlarge the repertoire of materials that formulation scientist have available for designing, for example, a pharmaceutical dosage form of a drug with a targeted release profile or other desired characteristic and so the present invention provides new crystalline form Temozolomide.<br>
