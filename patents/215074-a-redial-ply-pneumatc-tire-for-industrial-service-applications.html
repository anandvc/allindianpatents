				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a pneumatic agricultural tire for an industrial type tractor or like vehicle.<br>
 Background Art<br>
Farm tire designs for industrial service are classified as R-4 service. Overall R-4 service is quite severe and typically involves high loads at a large degree of roading. The vehicles to which the tires are mounted typically are exposed to large amounts of debris, hard packed soil conditions and high load service conditions.<br>
Often times the vehicle has a back hoe bucket or a front skid loader attached to the vehicle. The tires must traverse gravel and broken concrete and hard packed dirt normally. Occasionally the work site can get rain soaked requiring good traction in wet soil conditions.<br>
These tires are generally relatively small and typically have a nominal rim diameter of 28" (71 cm) or less. They generally have a nonskid depth at the centerline of the tire at approximately 1" (2.54 cm). A typical tire may be a 400/70R24 tire. This tire when produced in a radial construction will have a carcass with 3 to 4 plies of synthetic cord reinforcement. The cords generally are nylon or polyester. The carcass will further include four belts of high flex polyester, nylon or aramid. Historically, these tires have been all fabric reinforced in order to provide better ride and handling.<br>
There has been a continual tradeoff in attempting to increase the aggressive offroad and tractor performance of these tires while maintaining the treadwear durability and ride requirements. The invention disclosed in this patent application teaches a novel tread that is both comfortable riding, long wearing while also achieving superior offroad traction in both the forward and reverse direction of vehicle travel. <br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>

Each lug 50 of the second row lies within a second tread half 32B. The lugs 60 of the central row lie in both the first tread half 32A and second tread half 32B. All lugs 40,50,60 have a leading edge 41,51,61 and a trailing 42,52,62 edge. The leading edge 41 of a lug 40 of the first row and a majority of the leading edge 61 of the central lug 60 are defined by a single constant radius of curvature R1 The trailing edge 52 of a second row lug 50 and a majority of the trailing edge 62 of the central lug 60 are defined by a single constant radius curvature R2, wherein the origin of the radii of curvature Rl, R2 are circumferentially oppositely located in one tread half 32A or 32B relative to the other tread half.<br>

More preferably, the trailing enlarged lug head 66 of a central lug 60 is connected to a leading enlarged lug head 64 of a circumferentiaUy adjacent central lug head 60 by a reduced height tie bar 70. The central lug 60 has a radial height h as measured from the inner tread base 34 and the tie bar 70 connecting the lug heads 64,66 has a radial height hT1 of at least 30 % h. The lugs 40 of the first row and the axially adjacent central lugs 60 are spaced a distance S less than the minimum width of the lug 40, within the distance S a tie bar 80 extends between the axially adjacent lugs 40 of the first row and the lugs 60 of the central row, the tie bar 80 having a radial height hT2 of at least one half the lug height h.<br>
Similarly, the lugs 50 of the second row and the axially adjacent central lugs 60 are spaced a distance S less than the minimum width of the lug 50, within the distance S a tie bar 80 extends between the axially adjacent lugs 50 of the second row and the lugs 60 of the central row, the tie bar 80 having a radial height hT2 of less than one half the lug height h.<br>
The radial ply pneumatic tire 20 according to the invention has the net-to-gross ratio as measured around the circumference of the tire less than 50%.<br>
The curvatures R1 and R2 when extended to intersect the equatorial plane EP of the tire 20 have tangent lines 90 at the point of intersection which are inclined at an angle θ,θ being<br>
less than 60° relative to the equatorial plane. Preferably 6 equals less than 45° relative to the equatorial plane.<br>
The leading and trailing edges 41,42,51,52 of the first and second rows of lugs 40,50 have tangency lines 92 relative to the curvature R1 or R2 at an axially outermost point 45,55 along the respective edge, the tangency being inclined at an angle a0 of about 90° relative to the equatorial plane EP.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention. Now referring to Fig. 4 a tire is shown in cross-sectional view generally as reference numeral 20. The tire has a casing 21 having one or more carcass plies 22 extending circumferentially about the axis rotation of the tire. As illustrated the tire preferably has 3 to 4 cord reinforced plies having synthetic nylon or polyester cords. The carcass plies are anchored around a pair of substantially inextensible annular beads 24. A belt reinforcing member 26 has one or more belt plies disposed radially outward from the carcass plies. Preferably four belts are employed. The belts being of a polyester, nylon or aramid cord reinforcement alternatively the cords can be of an ultra high tensile monofilament<br>
steel cord reinforcement. These belt plies provide reinforcement for the crown region of the tire 20. A circumferentially extending tread 32 is located radially outwardly of the belt reinforcing structure 26.<br>
A sidewall portion 33 extends radially inwardly from each axial or lateral tread edge 33A,33B of the tread to an annular bead portion 35 having the beads 24 located therein. Carcass plies 22 preferably have the cords oriented radially. The number of plies depends on the load carrying requirements of the tire. The figures illustrate the preferred tread pattern made in a nondirectional fashion.<br>
Now referring to Figs. 1, a tire 20 according to the present invention, is illustrated. The tire 20 according to the present invention as a unique nondirectional tread 32. The tread 32 has a first tread edge 33A and a second tread edge 33B. Disposed between the tread edges 33A and 33B is an inner tread 34 and a plurality of lugs 40,50 and 60 extending radially outwardly from the inner tread 34. As illustrated in Fig. 2 each central lug 60 has a radially outer surface 68, a leading first edge 61, a trailing second edge 62, and a center line 63 between the first and second edges. Each central lug 60 extends generally circumferential from an enlarged lug head portion 64 to a trailing enlarged lug head portion 66.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the average distance along the center line 63 between the leading and trailing ends 61,62 defines the total lug length L1 of the central lug 60. The length L1 is at least 10% of the tread width, preferably about 30%.<br>
The distance extending substantially perpendicularly between the first and second edges 61,62 of the central lug 60 define the average lug width (Iw). The radial distance extending between the inner tread 34 and the tread edges 61,62 of the lug 60 defines the radial lug height h. At the equatorial plane of the tire 20 the lug height preferably is an R-4 type lug height as specified by the Tire &amp; Rim Industry standard for industrial service applications.<br>
The central lugs 60 are arranged in a circumferentially repeating row of lugs 60, each lug 60 extends crossing the equatorial plane (FP). The circumferentially adjacent central lugs 60 are similarly oriented. Each lug 60 preferably lies equally within each of the respective tread halves 32A or 32B. The leading edges 61 as shown lie entirely within tread half 32A while the trailing edges 62 lie entirely the tread half 32B. These central lugs 60 have an enlarged lug heads 64,66 at both the trailing and leading ends 61,62 of the lug 60. The average width of the lugs 60 is slightly enlarged relative to the average width of the shoulder lugs 40,50. This enlarged central lug 60 is extremely durable and provides excellent traction and ride performance.<br>
The ride performance and traction capabilities is further enhanced by the employment of a plurality of shoulder lugs 40,50 which extend from each respective tread edge 33A or 33B and lie entirely within their respective tread half 32A or 32B. The shoulder lugs 40 and 50 have a total lug length L1 about equal to the total lug length L1 of the central lug 60. As shown, the shoulder lugs have a lug length L1 of about 10 to 30% of the tread width. The shoulder lugs 40,50 are divided into two rows. The first row of shoulder lugs 40 has an axially inner end 43 that is located substantially circumferentially aligned with the axially inner ends 53 of the second row of lugs 50. The second row of shoulder lugs 50 extend from the tread edge 33B and have a length substantially equal to the length of the first row of shoulder lugs 40. The second row of shoulder lugs 50 have an axially inner end 53 that is circumferentially located generally aligned with the axially inner ends 43 of the first row of lugs 40. As shown in Fig. 6, both the first row and second row of shoulder lugs 40,50 have preferably a uniform curvature. The axially inner inclination α1 being about 45° relative to the equatorial plane of the axially outer inclination α0 is about 90° relative to the equatorial plane. As further shown in Fig. 6, the central lug 60 has a middle portion which has a center line 63 intersecting the leading and trailing ends 64,66 lying between edges 61,62. The centerline 63 is oriented at an angle ß of less than 50°, preferably about than 45° relative to the equatorial plane.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the net-to-gross ratio of the tread is less than 50% preferably 45%. The space between the lugs creates large soil discharge channels 36. These channels create a very open tread pattern. The openness of the tread pattern further enhances the self-cleaning properties of the tread 32 keeping it from packing with mud.<br>
It is understood that one can vary the overall shape of the lugs 40,50 and can modify the general orientation or appearance of the lugs without departing from the spirit of the claimed invention which is directed to the novel tread patterns disclosed herein.<br>
With further reference to Fig. 5, the first row and second row of shoulder lugs 40,50 and the central lugs 60 are axially spaced at the outer surface 48,58 and 68 of the lugs 40,50,60 such that the axially inner ends 43,53 of the first and second rows of shoulder lugs 40,50 are axially aligned within each respective row. The leading ends 64 and the trailing ends 66 of the central lugs 60 are also axially aligned with each circumferentially adjacent central lugs respective leading and trailing ends. A plane P1  is tangent to the inner ends 43 of the first row of shoulder lugs 40 and is spaced an axially distance d1 from a plane CT tangent to the trailing ends 66 of the central lugs 60. A plane P2 tangent to the axially inner ends 53 of the second row of the shoulder rows 50 is spaced a distance d2 from a plane CL. The plane CL is tangent<br>
to the leading ends 51 of the central lugs 50. The distance d1 and d2 form two circumferentially continuous straight channels 72 around the periphery of the tread 32. The agricultural tire preferably has the distances d1 and d2 being equal and the planes CT and CL each located an axial distance of 5% of the tread width or more from the equatorial plane (EP) as illustrated. Preferably the plane CT and CL are equally spaced from the equatorial plane (EP) a distance of at least 10% of the tread width.<br>
With reference to Figs. 1-6 a tread 32 of the tire 20 is shown having a nondirectional tread pattern. The tread 32 of tire 20 has the first row of shoulder lugs 40 oppositely oriented but similarly inclined relative to the shoulder lugs 50 of the opposite row as can be seen from the perspective view of Fig. 6 and the plan view of Fig. 7, the lugs 40 and 50 extend in a substantially curvalinear fashion across the tread 32. In the tire 20 when the tire is normally loaded and inflated, the tread 32 exhibits a net-to-gross ratio of less than 50% preferably about 45 %. The tire 20 exhibits a nominal rim diameter of 28" (71 cm) or less and a tread lug height h that is measured from the inner tread 34 to the radially outer surface 68 of the lugs 60 at the equatorial plane of an industry standard R-4 lug height. For example, in a 400/70R24 tire, the nonskid depth at the centerline of the tires 20 will be approximately one inch (2.5 cm).<br>
With reference to Fig. 4 as can be seen from the cross-sectional view of the tire, the tire 20 has a constant tread arc at the shoulder, the nonskid depth increases to approximately 125% to 175%, preferably 150%, of the nonskid depth as measured from the equatorial plane (EP) of the tire 20.<br>
Due to the contour of the tread 32 it can easily be appreciated that the center of the tread bears most of the load carrying capacity while the shoulder regions are provided to increase traction and provide additional biting or digging surfaces which provide traction particularly in loose soil or loose debris. It is believed preferable that the tread lugs 40,50 be reasonably braced using generous angles and tie bar bracing 70,80 to further enhance the stiffness of the lugs and to improve its durability.<br>
One novel feature of this nondirectional tread pattern of the tire 20 is in Figs. 1-5 is that the lugs 40 of the first row and the lugs 50 of the second row 46 do not axially overlap at the equatorial plane. This was a common feature employed in industrial service R-4 tires of the prior art. Secondarily, the central lugs 60 do not overlap or interlock with either the first or the second rows of shoulder lugs 50. Again, this feature is not believed to have been employed in this type of tire heretofore. The benefits of this feature is that the tread pattern remains<br>
relatively open increasing the overall tractive performance of the tire while not sacrificing the overall ride performance.<br>
An equally important novel feature of the lugs 40,60 and 50,60 is that a leading edge 51,61 and trailing edges 42,62 of the shoulder lug and central lugs are of identical curvatures R! or R2 respectively as shown. This means that the biting edges of two lugs 40,60 or lugs 50,60 depending on the direction of travel enter the footprint of the tire with a similar single radius of curvature and in combination with an enlarged lug head of a central lug creating a traction enhancing elongated lug effect. This elongation of similar tractive curvature extends beyond the equatorial plane regardless of the direction of tread. This creates a balance of forward or reverse draw bar traction efficiency which is approximately equal regardless of the rotation direction.<br>
This further enables the tire to be produced in a single mold cutting tooling cost in one half.<br>
As shown the illustrated preferred embodiment tire in a 400/70R24 tire had an R1 of about 200 mm and an R2 equal to Rl preferably the tire shown had an R1 R2 of 205.8, R1 being the radius of curvature of the leading edge 41 of lug 40 and R2 being the radius of curvature of the trailing edge 52 of lug 50. The respective opposite edges 42,52 had radii of curvature less than R1 and R2, those curvatures R3 and R4 respectively were about 180 mm, actually 179.1 mm. This combination of curvatures means that the lugs 40,50 are wider at the lateral edges 33A, 335 and progressively narrower toward the ends 43,53 respectively. Similarly, the soil discharge channels 36 widen as they extend axially further enhancing the soil discharge performance of the tire 20.<br>
As further shown, the tie bars 70 in the preferred tire had a radial height equal to 40% lh and the tie bars 80 had a radial height of 33% to 40% 1h This insured that sufficient openness of the lug pattern prevents soil packing. The tie bars yield an open somewhat flexible tread with very durable lugs 40,50,60 due to the interconnection of the lug via the tie bars 70,80.<br><br><br><br><br>
