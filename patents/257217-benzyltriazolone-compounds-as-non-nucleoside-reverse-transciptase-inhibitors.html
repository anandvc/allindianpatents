BENZYLTRIAZOLONE COMPOUNDS AS NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS<br>
The human immunodeficiency virus HIV is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease characterized by the destruction of the immune system, particularly of the CD4+ T-cell, -with attendant susceptibility to opportunistic infections. HIV infection is also associated with a precursor AIDs-related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.<br>
In common with other retroviruses, the HIV genome encodes protein precursors known as gag and gag-pol which are processed by the viral protease to afford the protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), endonuclease/integrase and mature structural proteins of the virus core. Interruption of this processing prevents the production of normally infectious virus. Considerable efforts have been directed towards the control of HIV by inhibition of virally encoded enzymes.<br>
Currently available chemotherapy targets two crucial viral enzymes: HIV protease and HIV reverse transcriptase. (J. S. G. Montaner et al Antiretroviral therapy: 'the state of the art", Biomed &amp; Pharmacother. 1999 53:63-72; R, W. Shafer and D. A. Vuitton, Highly active retroviral therapy (HAART)for the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, Biomed. &amp; Pharmacother.1999 53:73-86; E. De Clercq, New Developments in Anti-HIV Chemotherap. Curr, Med. Chem. 2001 8:1543-1572) Two general classes of RTI inhibitors have been identified: nudeoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTT) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI).<br>
NRTTs typically are 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs which must be phosphorylated prior to interacting with viral RT. The corresponding triphosphates function as competitive inhibitors or alternative substrates for viral RT, After incorporation into nucleic acids the nucleoside analogs terminate the chain elongation process. HIV reverse transcriptase has DNA editing capabilities which enable resistant strains to overcome the blockade by cleaving the nucleoside analog and continuing the elongation. Currently clinically used NRTIs include zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddl), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (PMPA).<br>
NNRTIs were first discovered in 1989. NNRTI are allosteric inhibitors which bind reversibly at a nonsubstrate-binding site on the HIV reverse transcriptase thereby altering<br><br>
the shape of the active site or blocking polymerase activity. (R. W. Buckheit, Jr., Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: perspectives for novel therapeutic compounds and strategies for treatment of HIV infection, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2001 10(8)1423-1442; E. De Clercq The role ofnonO-nuceloside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the therapy of HIV-1 infection, Antiviral Res. 1998 38:153-179; G. Moyle, The Emerging Roles ofNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in Antiviral Therapy, Drugs 2001 61(l):19-26) Although over thirty structural classes of NNRTIs have been identified in the laboratory, only three compounds have been approved for HIV therapy: efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine. Although initially viewed as a promising class of compounds, in vitro and in vivo studies quickly revealed the NNRTIs presented a low barrier to the emergence of drug resistant HIV strains and class-specific toxicity. Drug resistance frequently develops with only a single point mutation in the RT.<br>
While combination therapy with NRTIs, Pis and NNRTIs has, in many cases, dramatically lowered viral loads and slowed disease progression, significant therapeutic problems remain. The cocktails are not effective in all patients, potentially severe adverse reactions often occur and the rapidly reproducing HIV virus has proven adroit at creating mutant drug-resistant variants of wild type protease and reverse transcriptase. There remains a need for safer drugs with activity against wild type and commonly occurring resistant strains of HIV.<br>

U.S. Serial No. 10/807,766 (U.S. Patent Publication 20040192704) filed March 23, 2004 discloses benzyl-triazolone andben2yl-oxa(thia)diazolone compounds which inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV RT)  U.S. Serial No. 10/807,993 filed March 23, 2004 (U.S. Patent Publication 20040198736)disdoses benzyl-pyridazinone compounds which inhibit HIV RT. A U.S. application filed April 22, 2005 by J. P. Dunn et al. claiming priority to U.S Ser. No 60/565,117 filed April 23,2004 discloses N-aryl 3-phenoxy-phenylacetamide compounds what are inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. These applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In U.S. Ser. No, 11/085,869 filed March 22,2005 J. P. Dunn et aL disclose prodrugs of benzyl-pyridazinone compounds, including N-acyloxymethyl derivatives.<br>
Drug failure can result in selection pressure for resistant strains. The facility which mutations occur during HIV replication has resulted in a large number of strains in the infected population. This has resulted in the need for drugs that exhibit activity against a spectrum of reverse transcriptase with one or more point mutations. Since the efficacy generally varies against different mutants, high circulating levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredient must be available to provide adequate activity against even the most resistant strain and avoid selection pressure which would favor resistant strains.<br><br>
The triazolones (I, R4 = H) previously disclosed lack sufficient bioavailability to produce blood levels high, enough to control all the commonly observed strains.<br>
Chemical derivatization of active drug moieties is frequently undertaken for a variety of reasons including modification of undesirable physical properties of the active drug, optimization of the pharmacokinetic parameters effected absorption, distribution and metabolism of the active ingredient and site-specific targeting or localization of the active moiety to specific target tissues or cells. Albert introduced the term prodrug to describe a compound which lacks intrinsic biological activity but which is capable of metabolic transformation to the active drug substance (A. Albert, Selective Toxicity, Chapman and Hall, London, 1951). While the metabolic transformation can catalyzed by specific enzymes, often hydroiases, the active compound can also be released by non-specific chemical processes. Prodrugs have been recently reviewed (P, Ettmayer et al, J. Med Chenu 2004 47(10):2393-24G4; K. Beaumont et al, Curt. DrugMetak 2003 4:461-485; H. Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs: Bioreversible derivatives for various functional groups and chemical entities in Design of Prodrugsy H. Bundgaard (ed) ElSevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam 1985; G. M. Pauletti etal Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997 27:235-256; K. Beaumont et al Cum DrugMetab. 2003 4:461-485),<br>
Amide (7) prodrugs have included N-hydroxymethyl derivatives (8a) the most common of which are N-acyloxymethyl (8b) compounds. (H. Bundgaard supra, pp 10-27; S. A. Varia et al.,. Pharm. So., 1984 73(8):1068-1073).<br><br>
Potential prodrug candidates can sometimes be identified based on the chemical functionality contained in the molecule. However, chemical modifications which alter one aspect of the physical, chemical and biological properties of a molecule may introduce other undesirable properties not observed in the parent molecule. Thus, the identification of prodrugs is an uncertain and challenging exercise.<br>

The compounds of the present invention are prepared from 3-aryloxy-phenylacetic acid compounds 10 by a multi-step process (SCHEME 1) comprising elaborating the triazolone 11, introducing a hydroxymethyl substituent on the nitrogen 12 (X = OH) and acyiating the hydroxymethyl adduct 13. A variant on this general procedure involves the intermediate conversion of 12 (X = OH) to the corresponding chloromethyl compound 12 (X = Cl) which is subjected to silver(I)-ion assisted nucleophilic displacement with a carboxylic acid, (see Example 6)<br><br>
Contacting the triazolone compounds 11 with formaldehyde affords the corresponding hydroxymethyl compound 12. While the adducts are herein depicted as N-hydroxymethyl adducts, a triazolone, in analogy with an amide, is an ambident nucleophile and formaldehyde can, in principle, react with either the nitrogen atom or the adjacent carbonyl oxygen atom. The product ratio derived from ambident nudeophiles is often influenced by subtle factors and both the N-hydroxymethyl or O-hydroxymethyl compounds are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention. Acylation of 12 (X = OH) affords esters 13 (R" = (CH2)2CO2H).<br>
The acylation is conveniently carried out by contacting 12 "(X = OH) with an acyl halide or acid anhydride in a solvent such as DCM, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ether, THF, dioxane, benzene, toluene, MeCN, DMF, optionally in the presence of an<br><br>
inorganic or organic base (e.g., triethylamine, DIPEA, DMAP or pyridine) at temperatures between -20 and 200° C, but preferably at temperatures between -10 and 80° C to afford 6 (Y = alkyl or heteroaryl). The acylation may also be carried out with the free acid in the presence of an acid-activating agent or a dehydrating agent, e.g. isobutyl chloroformate, TMS-C1, DCC, DCC/N-hydroxysuccinimide or HOBT, GDI, O-(benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-uronium tetrafluoroborate/NMM, O-(benzoixiazol-l-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-uronium tetrafluoroborate/ DIPEA, N,N'-thionyidiimidazole or (C6H5)5P/CCI, at temperatures between -20 and 200° C, but preferably at temperatures between -10 and 80° C (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1992 392-398; J. Mulzer Synthesis of Esters, Activated Esters &amp; Lactones in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, E.

The 2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4] triazol-3-ones 16 used to prepare compounds of the present invention were prepared by cyclization of an N'-acyl-N-carbamoylhydrazide derivative according to formula 15. The requisite hydrazides are prepared by contacting an acylhydrazone 14b with an alkylisocyanate. Alternatively substituted phenylacetic adds 14c are condensed with a 4-alkyl-semicarbazide in the presence of a carboxylic acid activating group. Protocols for efficient activation and coupling of carboxylic acids with amine compounds have been extensively refined and optimized (see e.g.,M, Bodanszky, 'Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer Verlag, New York 1993; P. Lloyd-Williams and F. Albericio Chemical Methods for the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL 1997). The N'-acyl-N-caxbamoylhydrazides 15 were cyclized to a triazolone 16 by treatment with methanolic KOH or potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol.<br><br>

3-Phenoxy-phenyl-acetic acid compounds 14a and 14c which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of the present compounds have been described (J. Dunn, et al U.S. Publication 20040192704, U.S. Publication 20040198736 and U.S. Non-Provisional Application filed March 22,2005). These applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Compounds of the present invention contain biaryl ethers and the preparation of diaryl ethers has been reviewed (J. S. Sawyer, Recent Advances in Diaryl Ether Synthesis, Tetrahedron 2000 56:5045-5065). Introduction of the aryloxy ether can often be accomplished by direct SNAr displacement on an aromatic ring substituted with a leaving group and electronegative substituents. Huoroaromatic compounds with electronegative substituents are known to be sensitive to nudeophilic attack by soft nucleophiles. Fluorine substituents are generally significantly more labile than other halogen substituents. While hard nucleophiles like water and hydroxide fail to displace fluoride, soft nucleophiles like phenols, imidazoles, amines, thiols and some amides undergo facile displacement reactions even at room temperature (D. Boger et al, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000 10:1471-75; F. Ferrier Nudeophilic Aromatic Displacement: The Influence of the Nitro Group VCH Publishers, New York, NY 1991). Phenols typified by 6b and 12a can be treated with appropriately substituted aryl fluorine compounds to produce diaryl ethers (infra).<br>
Aryl ethers also can be efficiently prepared by Cu(OAc)2 catalyzed condensation of substituted benzene boronic acids and phenols (D. A. Evans et aly Tetrahedron Lett, 1998 39:2937-2940 and D. M. T. Chan et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 1998 39:2933-2936). This protocol can also be adapted to phenols such as 6b and 12a. Benzene boronic acids with a variety of other substituents are widely available.<br>
Alternatively, variations of the Ullmann diaryl ether synthesis with Cu(I) salts (J.-F. Marcoux etal, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997 119:10539-540; E. Buck etal Org Lett. 2002 4(9):1623-1626) or palladium-catalyzed coupling procedures also has been reported (G. Mann etal, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1999 121:3224-3225) have been described. One skilled in the art will appreciate that optimal procedure will vary depending on the nature and position of substituents on the aryl rings to be coupled and useful conditions for the coupling can by identified without undue experimentation.<br>
4-Chloro-2-fluoro-3-phenoxy-phenylacetic acid compounds (SCHEME 3) can prepared by starting from l-chloro-3-fluoro-2-methoxy-4-methylbenzene (17a) utilizing a sequence (17a-17c) comprising benzylic bromination with NBS and AIBN, cyanide displacement, hydrolysis of the nitrile and esterification of the carboxylic acid. Demethylation of the ether affords a phenol 18a which can be used to introduce the<br><br>
biaryl ether by SNAT displacement of a fluorine substituent on a suitably substituted benzene (e.g, 5 fluoroisophthalonitrile) or by coupling with a substituted benzeneboronic add under Suzuki conditions.<br><br>
The synthesis of 2-fluoro substituted compounds also was accomplished starting from l,2,3-trifluoro-4-nitro-benzene (19). Treatment of 19 with an alkali metal phenolate results in displacement of the 3-fluoro group with good regiosdectivity to afford 20a (SCHEME 4). Treatment of 20a with carbanion formed by deprotonation of tert-butyl ethyl malonate results in the regio selective introduction of a malonic ester (20b) which is subjected to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ester and decarboxylation to afford 20c. After introduction of the phenoxy and acetic acid moieties, the nitro group can be converted to other substituents at the 4-position. Reduction of the nitro substituent afforded 21a which was subjected to Sandmeyer conditions to introduce a bromo 21b or chloro 21e substituent. The bromo substituent was further reacted with a dialkyl zinc (the Negishi Reaction) to afford 4-alkyl-3-aryloxy-2-fluoro-phenylacetic acid compounds exemplified by 21c and 21d.<br>

Alternatively, the reaction of the mixed tert-butyl ethyl ester of malonic add affords a regioisomeric mixture of adducts in which displacement of the fluorine at the 1-position 22a predominates. The ratio of 1:3 isomers is approximately 2:1 and the isomers are conveniently separated by silica chromatography. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of 22a affords the phenylacetic acid 22b which is an effective substrate for introduction of the aryl ether by a second SNAT displacement and replacement of the nitro group by Sandmeyer-type chemistry.<br>
4-Alkoxy-2-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenylacetic acid compounds were prepared from o-difluorobenzene (SCHEME 5). A mixture ortho-difluorobenzene (23a) and trimethylsilylchloride was treated with butyl lithium to produce 2,3-difluoro-l,4--bis-trimethylsilanyl-benzene (23b) which was brominated to afford 23c. Selective monometallation of 23c with iso-propylmagnesium chloride-lithium chloride complex and quenching the organomagnesium compound with DMF afforded 23d. Reaction of 23d with a phenol in the presence of K2CO3 resulted in displacement of the fluorine atom adjacent to the aldehyde to afford 24a. The aldehyde was subjected to a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with trifluoroperacetic acid which underwent concomitant hydrolysis to the phenol 24b which was alkylated with CS2CO3 and methyl iodide to afford the methoxy substituted analog 24c. Metallation of the remaining bromine substituent with iso~ PrMgCl/Lil/THF and allylation of the resulting Grignard reagent afforded 25a which was oxidatively cleaved with NaICVRu(I[I)Cl3 to produce the phenylacetic acid 25b.<br>
SCHEME 5<br><br><br>
The substituted phenylacetic add esters thus obtained were converted to the corresponding triazolones as described previously.<br>
Useful aryl fluorides, such as 3-chlro-5-fluoro-benzonitrile, l-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro-benzene, 5-fluoro-isophthalonitriie and 3,5-dibromo-fluoro-benzene are commercially available or readily prepared from commercially available precursors. 3-Difluoromethyi-5-fluoro-benzonitrile (34) was prepared by monometallation of 1,3-dibromo-5-fluorobenzene (33a) and quenching the aryl lithium intermediate with DMF and fluorinating the resulting benzaldehyde (33b) with DAST to afford 33c. Cyanide substituents can be introduced into a aromatic ring by Zn(CN)2/pafladium-cataly2;ed displacement of a halogen by cyanide which can be carried out either after formation of the biaryl ether or on a halogenated precursor (SCHEME 6) prior to formation of the ether. Displacement of the bromine substituent with zinc cyanide affords 34. These fluorinated compounds are suited to condensation with a phenolic substituent on the phenylacetic acid fragment   Phenols useful for condensation with 19 or 22b are also readily available. 3-Bromo-5-difluoromethyl-phenol (28b) can be prepared by fluorination of 3-acetoxy-5-bromo-benzaldehyde (27b) with DAST. Optionally, displacement of the bromine substituents by cyanide can be carried out either before or after formation of the biaryl ether. Thus treatment of 29 with Zn(CN)2 and Pd(Ph3P)4(0) affords 30. 3,5-dibromophenol is commercially available and palladium-catalyzed displacement of both bromine atoms by cyanide affords 5-hydroxy-isophtixalonitrile. 3-Chloro-5-hydroxy-benzonitrile (31c) was prepared from 3,5-dichlorobenzonitrileby SNAR displacement with sodium methoxide and cleavage of the resulting methyl ether 31b. Condensation of 31b with 19 introduces the 3-chloro-5-cyano-phenoxy substituents into the phenylacetic acid containing a 4-nitro substituents for further modification of the 4-position. Similarly 3-bromo-5-chloro-phenol can be condensed with 22b and which was further converted to 32c.<br>

Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into to the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polyactic acid.<br>
Suitable formulations along with pharmaceutical carriers, diluents and expcipients are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania. A skilled formulation scientist may modify the formulations within the teachings of the specification to provide numerous formulations for a particular route of administration without rendering the compositions of the present invention unstable or compromising their therapeutic activity.<br>
The modification of the present compounds to render them more soluble in water or other vehicle, for example, may be easily accomplished by minor modifications (salt formulation, esterification, etc.), which are well within the ordinary skill in the art. It is also well within the ordinary skill of the art to modify the route of administration and dosage regimen of a particular compound in order to manage the pharmacokinetics of the present compounds for maximum beneficial effect in patients.<br><br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means an amount required to reduce symptoms of the disease in an individual. The dose will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. That dosage can vary within wide limits depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the viral load, the age and general health condition of the patient, other medicaments with which the patient is being treated, the route and form of administration and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. For oral administration, a daily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. A preferred daily dosage is between about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1.0 and about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 7 mg to 0.7 g per day. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically between 1 and 5 dosages per day. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect for the individual patient is reached. One of ordinary skill in treating diseases described herein will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance on personal knowledge, experience and the disclosures of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease and patient.<br>
In embodiments of the invention, the active compound or a salt can be administered in combination with another antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, another non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or HIV protease inhibitor. When the active compound or its derivative or salt are administered in combination with another antiviral agent the activity may be increased over the parent compound. When the treatment is combination therapy, such administration may be concurrent or sequential with respect to that of the nucleoside derivatives. "Concurrent administration11 as used herein thus includes administration of the agents at the same time or at different times. Administration of two or more agents at the same time can be achieved by a single formulation containing two or more active ingredients or by substantially simultaneous administration of two or more dosage forms with a single active agent.<br>
It will be understood that references herein to treatment extend to prophylaxis as weft as to the treatment of existing conditions. Furthermore, the term "treatment" of a HCV infection, as used herein, also includes treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or a condition associated with or mediated by HCV infection, or the clinical symptoms thereof.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>

Example 9<br>
Determination of Pharmacokinetic parameters<br>
Intact female rats weighing 200-250 g were used. Groups of three or five rats were used for each dose level of an experimental compound and one rat was used as a vehicle control. Animals were allowed normal access to chow and water throughout the experiment The test substance was formulated as an aqueous suspension containing hydroxypropyl cellulose, polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol adjusted to pH 3.5 with HC1 or NaOH at a dose equivalent to (0.127 mmol) and was administered orally by gavage. A blood sample (0.3 mL) was collected from the treated rats at, ,2 4, 6 and 8 h from the orbital sinus and at 24 h by cardiac puncture. A sample of at least 0.3 mL of blood was withdrawn from the untreated animals 3 h after dosing. Potassium oxalateJNaF and lithium heparin were added to the samples which were stored on ice during sampling procedure. The samples were spun in a refrigerated centrifuge at -4° C as soon as possible and the plasma samples were stored -20° C immediately after centrifugation and later transferred to a -80° C freezer until analysis. Aliquots of plasma (0.05 mL) were mixed with 0.35 mL of an internal standard (and 0.05 mL of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. A set of calibration standards was prepared by mixing 0.05-mL aliquots of plasma from untreated rats with 0.05-mL aliquots of standard solution in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and 0.35-mL aliquots of the internal standard in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid). Each plasma sample and calibration standard was vortexed thoroughly and then centrifuged (3000 x g) at 4 °C for 20 min to precipitate the protein. Each supernatant from centrifugation was transferred into a separate injection '    vial for LCJMSJMS analysis.<br><br><br><br>

HIV Reverse Transcriptase Assay: Inhibitor IC50 determination<br>
HIV-1 RT assay was carried out in 96-weU Millipore MultiScreen MADVNOB50 plates using purified recombinant enzyme and a poly(rA)Joligo(dT)16 template-primer in<br>
a total volume of 50 μL. The assay constituents were 50 mM TrisJHCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 μM dTTP, 0.15μCi [3H] dTTP, 5 (μg/ml poly (rA) pre<br>
annealed to 2.5 μg/ml oligo (dT)ie and a range of inhibitor concentrations in a final concentration of 10% DMSO. Reactions were initiated by adding 4 nM HIV-1 RT and<br>
after incubation at 37° C for 30 min, they were stopped by the addition of 50 }J ice cold 20%TCA and allowed to precipitate at 4°C for 30 min. The precipitates were collected by applying vacuum to the plate and sequentially washing with 3 x 200 \A of 10% TCA and 2 x 200μl 70% ethanol. Finally, the plates were dried and radioactivity counted in a<br><br>
Packard TopCounter after the addition of 25 μl scintillation fluid per well. IC50's (Table 2) were calculated by plotting % inhibition versus logic inhibitor concentrations.<br><br>
