				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a refrigerator shelf.<br>
In the refrigerator sector, the need for internal chambers (in which to preserve food for example at a temperature different from that in the rest of the preservation compartment, or otherwise separated from other foods) is satisfied in various ways. One example of such a chamber is represented by the so-called crisper representative of a chamber specifically dedicated to the preservation of fruit and vegetables. Another example is represented by the generally transparent containers resting on the shelves, for preserving foods to be maintained separated from others, for example for olfactory reasons (in the case of cheese).<br>
There exist however situations which cannot be satisfied by the aforedescribed solutions, such as a partly consumed delicate cake, confectionery products and the like, which are usually preserved in a refrigerator by resting them on a shelf in the box in which they were sold, and hence exposed to odours, contamination due to other food, and damage due to careless insertion and extraction of other food products into and from the refrigerator.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a shelf which by virtue of its specific construction enables a closable chamber to be obtained inside the refrigerator.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a shelf able to form a closable chamber by retractable means.<br>
These and further objects which will result from the ensuing detailed description are attained by a refrigerator shelf in accordance with the teachings as described herein.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a refrigerator shelf comprising a plate surrounded by a frame, characterised in that to the frame there are connected guide means for the slidable guiding of a closure member formed from an assembly of bar elements hinged together and able to pass from an extracted position in which it closes a chamber formed between said shelf and an underlying shelf, to an opening position retracted within the guide means.<br>
The invention will be more apparent from the ensuing detailed description thereof provided by way of non-limiting example and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure I is a schematic section through parts of a shelf according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a section on the line A-A of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view of guide means for a retractable closure member.<br>
In the figures, the reference numeral 1 indicates the shelf overall. It comprises a plate 2 of glass or of crystalline engineering polymer surrounded by a frame 3 of a different engineering polymer.<br>
According to the invention, the shelf is provided, along its two lateral sides, with guide means 4 represented by C-shaped formations facing downwards and towards each other, they forming one piece with the frame 3 and having their front side (see Figure 1) terminating downwards in the form of an arch (as indicated at 4 A).<br>
The guide means 4 serve to guide a closure member 5, which for pure descriptive convenience is identified hereinafter by the term "roll shutter". The roll shutter is formed from a plurality of substantially identical bar elements 5A hinged together by the snap-engagement of a rectilinear bulge 6 in a matching groove 7 of the adjacent element. In other words each element presents the groove 7 on one side and the bulge 6 on the other side.<br>
The material of these elements is so-called crystalline polyvinylchloride.<br><br>
As can be seen from the figures, the rectilinear bulge 6 is situated at the end of a rib 6A which is inclined towards the lower side of the guide means 4A (when the element 5A is inside these latter), the matching groove 7 also being displaced towards this lower side, to enable the "roll shutter", as shown in Figure 1, to describe with the minimum possible radius the 90Â° bend through which the "roll shutter" passes from its horizontal path defined by the guides 4 to its vertical path in which, as will be apparent hereinafter, it closes a chamber S bounded upperly by the shelf which supports the roll shutter in question, frontally by this latter, lowerly by the underlying shelf and laterally by the walls of the refrigerator compartment. As shown in Figure 3, these walls can carry shaped vertical guide projections, indicated by 8 in said figure.<br>
The operation of the invention should be apparent from the aforegoing description.<br>
When the roll shutter 5 is substantially entirely within the guide means 4 of its shelf 1, the aforesaid chamber S is open.  By manually moving the roll shutter frontwards (arrow F) by sliding it, it passes between the guide projections 8 to frontally close said chamber.<br>
As will be apparent, movement in the opposite direction causes the roll shutter to retract, i.e. to substantially withdraw below the relative shelf.<br>
The figures also show that on the outside of the part 4A of the guide means a fixed rectilinear bulge 9 similar to the bulges 6 can be provided, to engage the groove 7A of the end element 5A in order to retain the roll shutter.<br>
The end element of the roll shutter can differ from the others by the presence of an operating appendix or handgrip 11 and possibly a lever 12 to facilitate release of the bulge 9 from the groove 7A with which it is engaged.<br><br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 1, the roll shutter elements 5A can be provided with longitudinal channels or depressions 13 with which there can engage toothed wheels 14 supported in appendices 15 of the guide means 4 and associated with torsion springs (not shown) which are loaded when the roll shutter is lowered (chamber closed) and are released on opening the chamber, to facilitate or cause retraction of the roll shutter.<br>
The roll shutter elements are essentially profile bars obtained by extrusion (hence at low cost) and can be easily adapted to refrigerator preservation compartments of different widths by cutting them to the required size. The elements are hollow and can hence be filled with heat insulating material, expanded in situ. The invention is versatile in the sense that, within determined limits (shelf depth), it can be used to close chambers of different heights by means of its roll shutter.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM   :<br>
1.	A refrigerator shelf comprising a plate surrounded by a frame, characterised in that to the frame (3) there are connected guide means (4, 4A) for the slidable guiding of a closure member (5) formed from an assembly of bar elements (5A) hinged together (6, 7) and able to pass from an extracted position in which it closes a chamber (S) formed between said shelf (1) and an underlying shelf, to an opening position retracted within the guide means (4, 4A).<br>
2.	A shelf as claimed in claim 1, wherein the guide means (4, 4A) form one piece with the frame (3) and extend below it.<br>
3.	A shelf as claimed in claim 1 or in claims 1 and 2, wherein the bar elements (5A) are hollow, and present on one side a rectilinear bulge (6) and in the opposite side a matching groove (7) which snap-engages a bulge to form therewith a hinge connection.<br>
4.	A shelf as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein, to enable the closure member to move along a 90Â° bend with the smallest possible radius of curvature, the rectilinear bulge (6) is disposed at the end of a rib (6A) inclined towards the lower side of the guide means (4, 4 A), and the groove (7) is situated close to said side.<br>
5.	A shelf as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein at one end (4A) of the<br>
guide means (4) there is provided a rectilinear bulge (9) for releasable snap-<br>
engagement in the groove (7 A) of the front element of the closure member.<br>
6.	A shelf as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the front element presents controllable release means (12).<br>
7.	A shelf as claimed claims 5 and 6, wherein the front element presents a gripping appendix (11).<br><br>
8.	A shelf as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein a device (13, 14, 15) is<br>
provided to facilitate or determine the retraction of the closure member (8) into the<br>
interior of the guides (4, 4A).<br>
9.	A shelf as claimed in claim 8, wherein the device (13, 14, 15) comprises toothed<br>
wheels (14) associated with torsion springs and cooperating with recesses present in<br>
the bar elements (5 A).<br>
10.	A refrigerator shelf substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.</td>
