                 GERMANY<br><br>
3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to an insert for a bearing box and a pivot bearing structured from this.<br>
An insert and pivot bearing of this kind are known from the EP1 315 911 Bl. The pivot bearing described there covers a bearing box developed as casting. The bearing box consists of at least two bearing parts rotating around a rotary axis and relative to each other, between which at least one insert is arranged. The manufacturing of the pivot bearing follows here cost effectively in a single casting process, wherein for developing the pivot bearing the insert or the insertion parts are inserted in a casting mold, and then the bearing are developed by the casting process and are formed at the same time according to the insertion part(s).<br>
The insert used for this purpose consists of two bearing bushes sliding in each other, which are provided with bearing surfaces sliding in each other and outer sides facing the respective bearing part. In this the bearing surfaces sliding in to each other are developed as smooth and without any play. Whereas, the outer sides are roughened up and, can be permanently joined with the respective bearing part.<br>
The bearing sleeves are developed in cap shape. Between these a bearing surface is developed, on which both the bearing bushes slide against each other. The bearing bushes form a single cylindrical lateral body, which is closed at one end through a cylindrical base and at its other end has a radial circulating edge oriented outwards. The bearing surface covers across the entire contour of the bearing bushes, because these are identically developed and rest next to each other as sliding across the entire contour.<br>
Though the pivot bearing structured with this insert can be produced rationally in a single casting process. However, the disadvantage here is that the intersections formed by the edges of the cap shaped insertion parts between both the bearing bushes are very narrow, that means these have a very small cross section surface. These intersections must be covered in the casting mold through apertures, so that<br>
no casting material can reach these during the casting and can penetrate in the gaps<br><br><br>
between the bearing bushes. Due to the small intersection between the bearing bushes these kinds of apertures must also be dimensioned very small. For this reason, very high requirements are to be put for the accuracies while executing apertures and their positioning. Although, while doing so, there is a danger that during the casting process casting material penetrates in the gaps between the bearing bushes.<br>
A further disadvantage of this pivot bearing is in the fact that this shows an undesirably low stability on occurrence of shearing forces. In this kind of shearing forces occurring diagonal to the axis of symmetry damages to the pivot bearing can be caused by the fact that the narrow front portion of the bearing part shears in a bearing bush of the insertion part. This is based on the fact that this front portion due to its low cross section is a weak point of the bearing part, which is insufficiently stabilized through the development of the bearing bushes.<br>
At the basis of the invention is the task to develop an insert of the kind mentioned at the outset in such a manner that the pivot bearing structured with this can be manufactured cost effectively and has at the same time a high stability.<br>
For resolving this task the characteristics of the claims 1 and 14 have been provided. Advantageous execution forms and appropriate further developments of the invention are described in the sub-claims.<br>
The invention based insert for a bearing box consists of bearing bushes sliding into each other, of which first bush is connected with a suspended bearing part and the second bush with a rotatable suspended bearing part as components of the bearing box. Each of the components of the bearing bushes sliding into each other consists of a sleeve and an edge closing at its open bottom side, oriented radialy outwards and running circular in circumference direction of the sleeve. At each edge closes one edge segment. The edge segments are oriented in axial direction of sleeves and project in opposite directions above the respective edges.<br><br><br>
For producing the invention based pivot bearing one or more invention based insertion parts are inserted in a casting mold. Then the pivot bearing in can be rationally produced in a single casting sequence. In the casting process casting material is poured in a casting mold, in which the insertion part(s) have been arranged, so that in this casting mold the bearings parts building the bearing box can be formed on the insert or the insertion parts. As casting material in this case metal as well as plastic can be used.<br>
A major advantage of an insertion part used for the production of such a pivot bearing is in the fact that the at the edge segments closing at the edges of the bearing bushes form a large area contact surface, which limits the intersection between the bearing bushes, at which in the casting mold matching large area apertures can be put, which prevent that the casting material penetrates during the casting process in the gaps between the bearing bushes of the insertion part. With the large area development of the contact surfaces and the apertures that are put on it a reproducible and secure cover of intersection between the bearing bushes of the insertion part is obtained.<br>
The edge segments of the bearing bushes provided in the invention based insert have further the advantage that the bearing parts formed at these insertion parts have a significantly increased stability against the shearing forces acting on the pivot bearing. This is based on the fact that the edge segments protruding from the edges of the bearing bush run in axial direction of the insertion part and thus enlarge the area of the proportion of the insertion part, which rests sideways on the portion of the bearing part, which protrudes in the area of the respective insertion part. Thus the stability in the shearing forces acting diagonal to symmetry axis of the insertion part is increased and especially the danger of shearing of portions of bearing parts of the bearing box protruding in the areas of the insertion part is prevented.<br><br><br>
The invention is explained below on the basis of drawings. These show:<br>
Figure 1:        Cross section through an insert for a bearing box.<br>
Figure 2: Schematic representation of a pivot bearing structured with insertion parts as per Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows an execution example of an insertion part 1 for a bearing box. The insert 1 can be inserted in a casting mold, wherein in one casting sequence casting material is poured in this and in this process at the insert 1 a suspending bearing part 2 and a suspended bearing part 3 are cast for forming the bearing box. Through the insert 1 the suspended bearing part 3 is rotatable with respect to the suspending bearing part 2.<br>
The insert 1 consists of two bearing bushes 4, 5, each of which consists preferably of a sheet metal part. The bearing bushes 4, 5 rotation symmetric with respect to a symmetry axis S are so developed that these can slide in to each other, so that with respect to the first bearing bush 4 with the suspending molded bearing part 2 the second bearing bush 5 with the molded suspended bearing part 3 can be rotated with respect to the symmetry axis S. Advantageously the surfaces of bearing bushes 4, 5 sliding against each other have sliding coatings, whereas the contact surfaces of the bearing bushes 4, 5 towards suspending bearing part 2 and towards suspended bearing part 3 can be roughened up.<br>
The contours of the bearing bushes 4, 5 are matched with each other in a way that their contact surfaces lie tight and as far as possible without play close to each other. In this both the bearing bushes 4, 5 are developed mainly in cap shape. Each bearing bush 4, 5 has a sleeve 4a, 5a with a cylindrical lateral body and a bottom closing the sleeve 4a, 5a at the top side. At the open bottom side of each sleeve 4a, 5a an edge 4b, 5b radialy outward oriented edge closes, which runs around the circumference direction. As is apparent from Figure 2, the sleeve 5a of the second, supporting<br><br><br>
bearing bush 5 protrudes in the hollow space of the sleeve 4a of the top, first bearing bush 4. Thus lie the top side of the sleeve 5a and the top side of the edge 5b of the second bearing bush 5 as sliding surfaces closely on the bottom side of the sleeve 4a and the bottom side of the edge 4b of the first bearing bush 4.<br>
Each of the edges 4b, 5b of both the bearing bushes 4, 5 run in a horizontal, level oriented vertically to the symmetry axis. The widths of the edges 4b, 5b are matched with each other in such a way that the edge 4b of the top bearing bush 4 rest fully on the edge 5b of the bottom bearing bush 5.<br>
At the edges 4b, 5b of both the bearing bushes 4, 5 one closes one each of an edge segment 4c, 5c as further component of the respective bearing bush 4, 5. The edge segment 4c protrudes above the top side of the edge 4b of the first bearing bush 4. Herein this edge segment 4c projects vertically upwards of edge 4c of the first bearing bush 4. The edge segment 4c is thus oriented in axial direction of the first bearing bush 4 and runs all around on the edge 4b at constant distance to lateral surface of the sleeve 4a of the first bearing bush 4.<br>
The edge segment 5c protrudes above the bottom side of the edge 5b of the second bearing bush 5. Herein this edge segment 5c projects vertically downwards of edge 5c of the second bearing bush 5. The edge segment 5c is thus oriented in axial direction of the second bearing bush 5 and runs concentric to the lateral surface of the sleeve 5b of the second bearing bush 5.<br>
The edge segments 4c, 5c protrude thus in opposite direction of the edges 4b, 5b of the bearing bushes 4, 5. The outer sides of edge segments 4c, 5c form surfaces flush to each other, which run along a lateral surface of a normal cylinder.<br>
The edge segments 4c, 5c of both the bearing bushes 4, 5 are developed identical in this case and have especially a same height, which is constant in circumferential direction of the bearing bushes 4, 5. The heights of edge segments 4c, 5c are, as is<br><br><br>
evident from Figure 1, smaller than the heights of sleeves 4a, 5a of bearing bushes 4, 5. Advantageously lie the heights of edge segments 4c, 5c are in the range of 25 % to 50 % of the heights of bearing bushes 4, 5. Especially advantageous is the height of an edge segment 4c, 5c about one third of the height of sleeve 4a, 5a of the respective bearing bushes 4, 5.<br>
The outer sides of both the edge segments 4c, 5c complement each other to a normal cylindrical lateral surface, which serves as contact surface of an aperture, which is pushed in the insert located in the casting mold, thereby during next casting sequence no casting material can penetrate in the gap between the bearing bushes 4, 5. Through the edge segments 4c, 5c a large size contact surface is made available. To match this size also the aperture can be developed, which is pushed against the insert located in the casting mold. Through this dimensioning of the aperture with high certainty a penetration of casting material in the gap between the bearing bushes 4, 5 during the casting process can be prevented.<br>
Further, the edge segments 4c, 5c of the bearing bushes 4, 5 ensure an increased stability against acting shearing forces, because with the edge segments 4c, 5c the shearing forces of the bearing bushes 4, 5 are significantly increased. In case of acting shearing forces, which act in specific angles to the symmetry axis S, that means diagonal to this, the edge segments 4c, 5c can take up these forces and prevent thus a shearing of segments of bearing parts of the bearing box protruding in the hollow space of the bearing bushes 4, 5.<br>
Figure 2 shows an execution example of a pivot bearing, which is structured from two insertion parts 1 as per Figure 1. In principle also developments of pivot bearings are possible with just one insert 1 or even three or more insertion parts 1. Both the insertion parts 1 of the pivot bearing according to Figure 2 are identically developed and correspond in their structure the insertion parts 1 as per Figure 1 that means the insertion parts 1 have in turn two bearing bushes 4, 5 sliding into each other.<br><br><br>
Between the insertion parts 1 a suspended bearing part 3 is provided. Outside on the insertion parts 1 two suspending bearing parts 2 or two segments of a suspending bearing part 2 close. The pivot bearing according to Figure 2 can for example be part of a hinge.<br>
The pivot bearing according to Figure 2 is produced in a single casting process, wherein the suspending bearing parts 2 forming the bearing box and the suspended bearing part 3 can be developed as pressure die cast part from light metal like aluminum or magnesium, or as plastic injection molded part.<br>
For the production of the pivot bearing both the insertion parts 1 in are inserted in a casting mold. For securing the intersections between the bearing bushes 4, 5 of the insertion parts 1 in turn apertures are put at the contact surfaces formed by the outer sides of the edge segments 4c, 5c of the bearing bushes 4, 5, according to which by pouring the casting material the pivot bearing is produced.<br><br><br>
