BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Call centers are typically used by organizations to service customers. Traditionally, customers called into a call center using POTS (plain old telephone service) but more and more organizations are implementing other types of media access such as email, voice mail, Web browsing, etc. to expand the ways by which their customers may contact them. Current attempts to integrate the different media into a single call center have proved ineffective because of the disparate nature of the different media types. For example, telephone calls usually average a few hundred a day, while emails often run into thousands a day, and daily hits on a Web site frequently number hundreds of thousands. Additionally, the response time expected by the customer varied depending on the media type used.<br>
One approach processes a contact based on its media type. This approach ignores the fact that the same media type can be used for different types of service. For example, a customer that calls a manned help line requires different handling than a customer calling an interactive voice response system. Another approach is to handle all contacts identically, regardless of media type. This approach fails to account for the different<br><br>
number of contacts and different expected response times for a customer independent of the various media types. Thus, a call center thai processes all calls as requiring an immediate response quickly becomes overloaded with cmnils.  Furthermore, both of these approaches involve extensive modifications to the systems that underlie the call center, such as the email system, the telephony system, etc., so that the many of the original features and benefits of the underlying systems are lost. Additionally, while some previous implementations appear to integrate analog contacts, such as voice calls, and digital contacts, such as email, the actual processing of the two types of contacts is separated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed by the present invention, which will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.<br>
A tiered service model for a digital multimedia contact center assigns an entering contact to an initial service tier based on routing criteria for the contact and may escalate or de-escalate the contact to a different service tier if the routing criteria changes. The routing criteria is initially determined based on a media type associated with the contact. The digital multimedia contact center contains a set of media routers, each of which passes a contact of a particular type to a workflow engine. The workflow engine starts a workflow for the contact and calls a dynamic automatic contact distributor to allocate an agent to the contact if the service tier of the contact requires agent activity. The workflow engine returns an identifier for the allocated agent to the media router, which then routes the contact to an agent desktop for the agent. The agent desktop presents the contact to the agent for processing. The workflow engine also creates a workflow for an agent to control the allocation of the agent to contacts.<br>
The digital multimedia contact center operates in conjunction with existing systems dedicated to a particular media type without requiring major modifications to those systems, thus leveraging the functionality of the existing systems. For example, emails are generally handled at one service tier by the standard operations of a conventional email system unless specially marked'in the email system as having been escalated to a higher service tier. Similarly, voice calls are initially assigned to a high<br><br>
service tier for handling by an agent but can be de-escalated to \\ lower service tier and muled l iin cxisling inlcnidivi: voico lespuiisn .syslem il'iippMiprinlr. Thus, llio diju'lnl multimedia contact cuntcr IWIIKIICH contacts in nccoidaucc with the contact's iciiuned level of service instead of relying solely on the media type to determine the necessary processing, r'urilicnuore, the digital multimedia contact center implements the most appropriate processing methodology for the number of contacts expected at each service tier.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, electrical, functional and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.<br>
The detailed description is divided into four sections and a conclusion. In the first section, a system level overview of the invention is presented. In the second section, methods for an embodiment of the invention are described with reference to flowcharts. In the third section, a particular Internet Contact Center (iCC) implementation of the invention is described. In the final section, an operating environment in conjunction with which embodiments of the invention may be practiced is presented.<br>
System Level Overview<br>
A system level overview of the operation of an embodiment of the invention is described by reference to FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a three-tiered service model 100 for a digital multimedia contact center. As shown, there are three service tiers: self-service tier 101, deferred service tier<br><br>
103, and immediate assistance tier 105. Contacts accessing the center at the self-service tier 101 do not require the assistance of an agent at the contact center, while contacts being serviced at the deferred tier 103 and the intermediate assistance tier 105 do require agent activity. A contact accessing the center at deferred tier 103 is presented to an agent in a "pull" model as a background task on the agent's computer desktop. An agent pulls a deferred contact for processing when there are no immediate assistance contacts to process. A contact at the immediate assistance tier 105 is presented in a "push" model as a foreground task. One immediate assistance contact is pushed to the agent's desk at any one time and in such a way that it is obvious to the agent that this contact must be handled immediately. As a particular contact is presented, any related customer information is also shown. The components for the different tiers are designed to handle different magnitudes of contacts. The self-service tier components will process orders of magnitude more contacts than the deferred tier components, which will process orders of magnitude more contacts than the immediate assistance tier components.<br>
A contact entering the contact center is initially assigned to one of the three tiers based on the type of media used by the contact in accessing the contact center. The embodiment shown in FIG. 1 is further described with reference to three media types: voice calls, emails, and World Wide Web, although the invention is not so limited. Voice calls are initially routed to the immediate assistance tier 103, emails are initially routed to the deferred tier 102, and Web contacts are initially routed to the self-service tier 101. Subsequent routing may be performed that escalates or de-escalates the contact to another tier (shown as arrows in FIG. 1). The subsequent routing can be based on one or more routing criteria, including factors defined by the contact center owner or subscriber, such as priority, access phone numbers, and time-out periods, and environmental factors such as contact activity. The routing criteria associated with a contact may change as the various components in the contact center process the contact. For example, if the routing criteria of a contact passes a pre-defined threshold, the contact may be escalated or de-escalated. Thus, an email is escalated (arrow 111) to the immediate assistance tier 103 if it has not been answered when a "lime-to-reply" period elapses. A voice call is initially routed to the immediate assistance tier 103 but is de-escalated (arrow 115) to the deferred tier 103 if the caller chooses to leave voice-mail, or de-escalated (arrow 113) to the self service tier 103 if the contact is sent to an interactive voice response (IVR) system for<br><br>
more processing. A self service Web contact can l&gt;e escalated (ai low 107) into the immediate assistance tier 103 by through "Click to Chat" -or "Click to Talk" buttons available on the Web site, or eocalated (arrow 109) to the deferred tier 103 if the contact chooses to send an email instead. Details of the escalation and de-escalation of each media type is described in more detail in conjunction with the flowcharts in the next section. Furthermore, although the exemplary embodiments focus on voice, email, and Web contacts for ease in understanding, it will be appreciated that the invention encompasses all potential analog and digital media types, including fax, "faxback," video, etc., in addition to being extensible to other WANs and to LANs, Tt will also be appreciated that the contact is not limited by its initial media type so, for example, the contact and agent in a collaboration session could be also taking by phone, an email message could generate a return fax or phone call, or the expiration of a time-out on a collaboration request might generate an email message to the contact promising a response within a set time period.<br>
The three-tier service model 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 operates within a digital multimedia contact system, one embodiment of which is shown in FIG. 2. The system architecture for contact center 200 is based on a workflow engine 201 that directs the activities of the agents in the center using workflow steps. A contact workflow is initiated by events that are routed into one of a set of workflow subsystems 205 by one of a set of media routers 221. Each media router 221 and each corresponding workflow subsystem 205 are dedicated to a contact media type. An agent workflow is initiated by events routed into an agent subsystem 219 by an agent desktop component 229. Events that trigger a workflow include a new call arriving at the contact center or an agent logging in. The workflow for a contact remains active until the contact is terminated; the workflow for an agent remains active until the agent logs out of the contact center 200.<br>
The workflows are executed by workflow logic 207. Events are passed between the workflow logic 207 and the workflow subsystems 205 by a message passing layer 203. The events can also modify the execution flow of existing contact or agent workflows.<br>
When executed by the workflow logic 207, a workflow for an immediate assistance contact causes a dynamic ACD (automatic contact distributor) 241 to allocate<br><br>
an agent lo the contact. The allocation is also reflected in the agent's workflow. The operation of the dynamic ACD. 241 is described in further detail below.<br>
A contact cominp, inlo llir contact rrntn ?.
A voice router 223 provides an interface between a voice subsystem 213 and a conventional digital telephony system (voice server 222), such as the DOT (Distributed Open Telephony) server from Tundo Corporation that handles IP (Internet Protocol) calls. The voice subsystem 213 starts a workflow when a call arrives at the contact center 200 and communicates a request to the voice server 222 to redirect the call to an agent (or to voice mail or IVR) as determined by the workflow. The voice server 222 receives digital voice calls (referred to as voice-over-IP or VoIP) directly from a digital wide-area network (WAN) 220, such as the Internet, or via a gateway 251, such as the Tundo Gateway, that converts analog voice calls 253 to VoIP calls. The gateway 251 also converts VoIP calls from the digital telephony system 222 into analog voice signal: for transmission buck to the caller.<br>
A conventional email system (email server 226), such as the Cisco Email Manager from Cisco Systems, processes deferred contacts received from the WAN 220 The email system uses its own in-line rules engine for processing incoming email and placing it into mailboxes to be accessed by the agents as background tasks. The agents retrieve deferred contacts from these mailboxes explicitly. An email escalator 227 provides an interface between an email subsystem 217 and the conventional email system for emails that are escalated from deferred to immediate assistance. The email escalator 227 periodically reviews the mailboxes for pending emails that meet per-<br><br>
determined criteria for escalation, such as lime-to-ieply or customer value parameters. It then collects information about the email (customer, priority etc) and passes this to the email subsystem 217. In one embodiment, the emails arc evaluated in chronological order and the emails that meet the escalation criteria are further broken down by classification and within a particular classification, the email is passed u&gt; Ihe email subsystem 217 on a first-in, first-out basis.<br>
The email subsystem 217 determines if the contact is entitled to be escalated to an immediate assistance contact based on the contact information and starts a contact workflow if it is. When the workflow succeeds in routing the email to an agent, the agent address is returned to the email escalator 227, which passes it to the email subsystem 217 for actual routing to the agent. In an embodiment in which voice mail is routed to an agent as an audio attachment to an email, the email escalator 227 also serves to escalate voice mails to the immediate assistance tier if appropriate.<br>
A conventional Web server 224 processes self-service contacts that originate from the WAN 220. Such a server can offer browsing and searching capabilities for a knowledge base, or a set of FAQs (frequently asked questions). A collaboration router 225 provides an interface between a collaboration subsystem 215 and a conventional collaboration system, such as the Cisco Collaboration Server from Cisco Systems, that executes on, or in conjunction with, the Web server 224. Web pages on the Web server 224 are modified to include "Click to Chat/Talk" buttons to connect to the collaboration system. When the button is clicked by a Web contact, the collaboration system sends an event to the collaboration router 225, which in turns sends an event to the collaboration subsystem 215. The collaboration subsystem 215 determines if the contact is entitled to be escalated to an immediate assistance contact and initiates a contact workflow if so. Once the collaboration request has been assigned to an agent, the agent address is passed back to the collaboration router 225 for actual routing. Other agents may be included in the collaboration session as necessary.<br>
An agent subsystem 219 provides an interface between one or more agent desktops 229 and the workflow logic 207 for agent events. When notified of an agent login by the corresponding agent desktop 229, the agent subsystem 219 validates the agent before starting an agent workflow that describe the agent's work process until the agent logs out. The agent desktop 229 notifies the agent subsystem 219 of all agent state<br><br>
changes. The agent subsystem 219 is also responsible lor watching the agent's phones for outbound call events. It passes this information to the workflow logic 207 to ensure the agent state is changed to "busy." In addition, when an agent initiates a call, the agent subsystem 219 sends an "outbound call" event to the agent's workflow so that agent-initiated contacts can be tracked.<br>
The agent desktop 229 controls the presentation of tasks on an agent's desktop. The tasks originate from the multiple conventional systems with which the contact center 200 interfaces as previously described, as well as from the workflow engine 201. Each of the conventional systems has its own user interface. Monitoring tools may also be available to certain agents, such as those providing statistics on the operation of the contact center and individual p^ents. The agent desktop 229 integrates the separate user interfaces into a single coherent interface that presents the agent with immediate assistance contacts as foreground tasks and deferred contacts as background tasks. Thus, for example, the foreground mode integrates the telephony interface, the collaboration interface, and the email interface (for escalated emails). Similarly, the background mode integrates the email interface (for non-escalated emails and other deferred contacts, such as voice mail, fax, forms, etc) and the monitoring tools, for example. The agent desktop 229 also integrates with any existing customer relation management application to provide customer information to the agent for the foreground and background tasks. The connections between the agent desktops 229 and the conventional systems 222, 224, 226 are not shown in FIG. 2 for clarity in illustration.<br>
In an alternate embodiment not shown, the agent desktops 229 do not communicate directly to the agent subsystem 219 but ate managed through a desktop manager component that handles concurrent requests from desktops and routes responses. To concurrently handle multiple desktops, a client portion of the desktop manager executes within each agent desktop component and communicates with a server portion that queues events arriving from the agent subsystem 219 and sends them to the appropriate desktop in response to polls from the desktops. Executing the server portion of the desktop manager on a machine separate from that executing the agent subsystem, provides additional scaling capabilities to the contact center.<br>
The relationship among the components of the contact center 200 described so far is most easily understood through an example. When an analog voice call 253 is received<br><br>
by the gateway 251,-it is convened to n VoIP call and directed by the voice, server 222 to a voice media router 223. The voice media router 223 informs the voice subsystem 213 of the incoming contact and the voice subsystem 2 13 creates ti workflow for llie eoniael. Assuming the contact is to remain at the immediate assistance tier 103, the workflow requests the dynamic ACD 241 allocate an agent lo the contact. The dynamic ACT) 241 passes the agent information back to the voice subsystem 213, which then sends the agent and contact information to the voice router 223. The voice router 223, in turn, sends the information to the voice server 222 for routing. The voice server 222 transfers the contact to the appropriate agent desktop 229 as a foreground task.<br>
Returning now to FIG. 2, the workflow engine 201 also contains a database 23 1 of contact 233 and agent records 235. A database unification layer 261 combines the information in the database 231 and information maintained by the voice 222, Web 224, and email 226 servers into a coherent view of the contact center. The contact and agent workflows query and update the database 231 through a database subsystem 211 that converts workflow requests into calls for the database unification layer 261. In an alternate embodiment not shown in FIG. 2, the contact and agent workflows query the database unification layer 261 directly. In yet another alternate embodiment, the database unification layer is incorporated into the database subsystem 211.<br>
The database unification layer 261 has access to, and is accessible by, all the Other components of the contact center to allow reporting and analysis of the activities of the contact center regardless of the media type used by the contacts. The connections between the database unification layer 261 and the other components are not shown in FIG. 2 for clarity in illustration. The information can be retrieved through the database unification layer 261 by a monitoring tool (not shown) to graphically and/or numerically illustrate the state of the contact center (number of contacts awaiting service, how many agents are on break, etc.). For instance, the monitoring tool may display the number of unserviced contacts broken down by classification. Additionally, a conventional reporting application can be employed to obtain information through the database unification layer* 261 for standardized reports. Agents, supervisors and managers may each have access to a set of such reports to gauge the efficiency of the contact center, a group, or individual agent. The database unification layer 261 also provides for the<br><br>
I collection of billing information and for the tracking of contacts through the contact center, both across media types.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the dynamic ACD 241 uses unordered lists of waiting contacts 237 and available agents 239 to match a contact with an agent. The workflow engine 201 causes the dynamic ACD 241 to create and manage the unordered lists of contacts 237 and agents 239. Although shown as separate from the database 231 in FIG. 2, it will be appreciated that the unordered lists 237, 239 may be database structures that are managed by the database subsystem 211 as instructed by the workflow engine 201 and the dynamic ACD 241.<br>
As previously described, contact requirements (e.g., product knowledge, language fluency, previous communication) are used to determine the set of agents to which a contact can be routed. Information used to decide the appropriateness of an agent within the set is referred to as "agent attributes" and may include such parameters as seniority and length of time waiting for a contact. Furthermore, agents may be dedicated to one or more contact classifications. When an immediate assistance contact requests an agent, the dynamic ACD 241 searches for an appropriate agent from the list 239 of available agents by filtering the agents against the contact classification and any requirements, and prioritizes the resulting agents according to their attributes. If an agent is available, the dynamic ACD 241 passes the information for the agent back to the appropriate subsystem to route the contact to the agent and removes the agent from the available agent list 239. If no appropriate agent is available, the contact is entered into the waiting contact list 237 until an appropriate agent becomes available to take the contact. Similarly, when an agent requests a contact, the waiting contact list 237 is filtered by classification and "agent requirements" (e.g., media type, territory) and prioritized according to contact attributes such as time in queue and business value. The matching process is invoked by a step in the contact workflow for an immediate assistance contact or in the agent workflow for an available agent as explained further below.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, there may be multiple instances of each of the media routers 221. There is also an instance of the agent desktop 229 running on each agent workstation in the contact center. Although only a single set of workflow subsystems 205 is shown, it will be appreciated that workflow engine 201 may contain multiple<br><br>
instances of one or more of the workflow subsystems 20.5 depending on workload. Additionally, multiple workflow engines 201 may be present within a contact center 200<br>
Furthermore, the architecture permits distribution of the various components among multiple computers, thus enabling scalability of the contact center 200. As described previously, each component provides services for other components. For instance, the dynamic ACD 241 provides an agent allocation service and the collaboration subsystem 215 provides a collaboration workflow service. In one embodiment, a service manager (not shown) provides a central location for registration and discovery of the contact center service providers. When a component needs a service (such as the initialization of a workflow), it calls the service manager to find the location of that service. The service manager reviews a list of all registered providers of that service and selects the appropriate providers (e.g., shortest routing to requester). Finally it chooses the best provider based on the unused capacity of each service. Thus, the contact center 200 may continue to start services on new or existing machines as necessary to deal with its workload.<br>
The system level overview of the operation of an embodiment of the invention has been described in this section of the detailed description. A tiered service model that allows the escalation and dc-cscalation of a contact has been described, along with its operation within a digital multimedia contact center. The digital multimedia contact center handles contacts in accordance with the contact's required level of service instead of relying solely on the media type to determine the necessary processing. Because different levels of service incur different quantities of contacts, different processing methodologies are appropriate within the contact center. Thus, workflows are used to handle immediate assistance contacts regardless of media type because a wurkl'low engine excels at processing relatively small numbers of contacts in real-time. A workflow engine also gives the subscriber fine-grained control over the handling of the high priority contacts that require immediate assistance. On the other hand, deferred contacts number least an order of magnitude greater than immediate assistance contacts and are handled most efficiently through an inline rule engine such as commonly implemented in an email (and/or voice mail) system. Finally, because the greatest number of contacts are self-service contacts which require no agent intervention,<br><br>
processing techniques such as interactive voice response, automatic email lesponsc, and knowledge base/FAQ logic on Web servers arc used.<br>
While ihe invention is no! limited to any particular minion ol sei vice tins, the invention has been described in terms of a three tier model. The invention has further been described using an example that mixes voice calls, emails, and Web contacts within the same contact center but the invention is not so limited. Additionally, the invention can be practiced with any underlying architecture that allows the escalation and de-escalation of contacts through a tiered service model.<br>
Methods of Embodiments of the Invention In the previous section, a system level overview of the operations of embodiments of the invention was described. In this section, the particular methods of one embodiment of the multimedia copy contact center 200 are described in terms of computer software with reference with a series of flowcharts and also a series of tier diagrams. The flowcharts and tier diagrams are grouped according to related components within the contact center. Thus, FIG. 3A and flowcharts FIGs. 4A-C illustrate the processing of the voice components. FIG. 3D and flowcharts 5A-C illustrate the processing of the email escalator components. FIG. 3C and flowcharts 6A-C illustrate the processing of the collaboration components. The processing of the agent .components are, illustrated only through flowcharts in FIGs. 7A-C.<br>
The methods to be performed by a computer constitute computer programs made up of computer-executable instructions. Describing the methods by reference to a flowchart enables one skilled in the art to develop such programs including such instructions to carry out the methods on suitably configured computers (the processor of the computer executing the instructions from computer-readable media) acting as one or more of the components of the contact center 200 in FIG. 2. The computer-executable instructions may be written in a computer programming language or may be embodied in firmware logic. If written in a programming language conforming to a recognized standard, such instructions can be executed on a variety of hardware platforms and for interface to a variety of operating systems. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the<br><br>
invention as described herein.

As shown in FIG. 3A, the voice components receive a voice phone call and direc it to either an agent for immediate assistance 305 or to an interactive voice response system 301 for self-service. If directed initially to an agent 305, the workflow engine may de-escalate the contact (represented by arrow 311) to voice mail 303 if an agent is not available within a given period of time. In addition, the workflow engine may de-escalate an immediate assistance contact, (represented by arrow 313) to interactive voice response (1VR) 301 if the call priority is less than a pre-determined amount or if the caller chooses self-service. A self-service contact may be escalated by a voice mail manager (represented by arrow 309) if the user chooses to leave voice mail. Alternatively, when a self-service contact requests active assistance from an agent, the workflow engine 201 and the dynamic ACD 241 escalate the contact into the immediate assistance 305 as represented by arrow 307. In an embodiment in which the voice mail recording is attached to an email for subsequent processing by an agent, the email with the voice mail attachment may be escalated through a combination of the email cscalaloi the workflow engine, and the dynamic ACD (represented by arrow 315) as explained below in conjunction with FIGs. 3B and 5A-C.<br>
Turning now to FIGs. 4A-C, the flowchart in FIG. 4A illustrates the acts performed by the voice router 223 component when executing a voice router method 400. The voice router method 400 receives notification of a call from the voice server 222 (block 401). As part of the information received from the gateway, the voice router method 400 receives the originating and destination phone'numbers for the call, which it then sends to the voice subsystem 213 (block 403). The voice subsystem determines how to route the call, as will be described further below, and sends the routing information to the voice ronler. The voice ronle.r method 400 receives die routing information (block 405) and then sends the routing information to the voice server 222 for routing (block 407).<br>
Turning now to FIG. 4B, a voice subsystem method 420 executed by the voice<br><br>
subsystem component 213 is described. The voice subsystem method 4?0 leceives (he • •lii'.lliillliif.', Illld doililllilioii (IIMUC iiiiiiilit'i.'i IIIMII Ilic Voire lonlei (block  I.'

FIG. 4C illustrates one embodiment of a voice workflow 450 that is executed by the workflow logic 207 for a voice contact. When the voice workflow 450 is initiated, it<br><br>
obtains contact information through the IVR process at block 451 (shown in phantom) if it is unable to determine the contact information from the oii|&gt;,inatiiij' phone nuinbei. The contact is classified based on its information at block 453. A determination is made as to the level of service to be given to this contact (block 455). II the contact is not entitled to immediate assistance, the voice workflow 450 requests the contact be routed to the IVR system by the voice subsystem (block 477). The voice workflow 450 continues to monitor the contact because a contact at the IVR self-service tier 301 may choose to leave a voice mail or wait for an agent during the IVR session by inputting certain digits. The input digits are captured as events by the voice workflow 450 at block 479 and, depending on the event, the voice workflow 450 escalates the contact to the deferred assistance tier 303 by transferring the contact into the voice mail system (block 471) or to the immediate assistance tier 305 by requesting an agent for the contact (block 457).   In one embodiment, the email system manager serves as the voice mail manager and the processing represented by block 471 is performed by the workflow. The workflow records the contact's message, attaches the recording to an email message addressed to a general mailbox, and sends the email to the email subsystem 217 for transmission to the email server 226,<br>
If the contact is entitled to immediate assistance, an agent is requested from the voice subsystem at block 457 and the caller is put on hold to wait for events from the voice subsystem (block 459). If a handle-agent event is injected into the voice workflow 450 by the voice subsystem because an agent allocated to this contact has answered the phone, the handle-agent event is detected at block 461 and contact information is sent to the voice subsystem (block 463). The voice workflow 450 then loops waiting for events and responding appropriately to those events, including updating the contact record, until the call is terminated as represented by block 465. Once the call is terminated, the voice workflow 450 sends a left-session event to the agent subsystem at block 467 that causes the agent to become available to receive a new contact.<br>
[f the contact chooses to be sent to voice mail prior to being routed to an agent (block 461), the voice workflow 450 sends a remove-contact event to the voice subsystem at block 469 to remove the contact from the list managed by the dynamic ACD. The voice workflow 4501 transfers the contact to the voice mail manager to record the message (block 471) and terminates the call after the messages is recorded (block<br><br>
473). The voice mail is then sent to a general mailbox to be acted upon by an agent at a later point (block 475). In one embodiment, the voice message is attached to an email • message and placed into the mailbox by the email system.<br>
Rctcrving, now to R'Gs. 3U and FKls. 5A-C, the email escalator component ul the .multimedia contact center 200 is described. As shown in FIGs. 3D, a defencd email 323 lis escalated into a high priority email 325 through a combination of the email escalator, the workflow engine, and the dynamic ACD (represented as arrow 327). Alternatively, an email message may be handled through an automatic response option in the conventional email system and such an email is dc-escalatcd by the email server 226 (represented as arrow 329) into an auto response contact 321. As automatic response options arc common in conventional email systems, the de-escalation process is not further described.<br>
FIG. 5A illustrates an email escalator method 500 performed by the email escalator 227. The email escalator method 500 constantly reviews the email system mailboxes or queues (block 501) to determine if any pending emails should be escalated based on factors previously described.  If an email is to be escalated (block 503), it is placed in a high priority queue (block 505) and the email information is sent to the email subsystem 217 at block 507. As will be explained in conjunction with FIG. 5B, the email subsystem 217 matches the contact to an agent and returns the agent identifier, which is received by the email escalator method 500 at block 509. The email escalator method 500 routes the email (via the email system) to the agent desktop (block 511) as a foreground task. In one embodiment, the email is presented on the desktop already opened. Once the agent has determined that he or she is ready to handle the email, the email escalator method 500 receives an agent-ready event from the agent desktop (block 5)3) and sends that event to the email subsystem at block 515. The agent workflow will not assign the agent to any other contacts until the email is handled. In another embodiment, the email escalator method 500 instructs the email subsystem to identify an email that is close to being escalated and to give the agent a visual clue, such as color or a special icon, that the email must be handled immediately.<br>
A component acting as the email subsystem 217 executes a email subsystem method 520 to perform the functions illustrated in FIG. 5D. The email subsystem method 520 receives the email information from the email escalator at block 521 and<br><br>
invokes the workflow lope 207 at block 523.  In OIK- embodiment, when ihe email subsysicm nii'lhod 520 receives ihe email inlm million ;tl block V ^ il K tealr, the contact record lor the email and marks it as escalated.  In an alternate embodiment, the email mnnaj'.er a contact record is created lor each email leceived al the contact center and the email subsystem method 520 marks the existing contact record us escalated at block 523.<br>
The workflow requests an agent from the email subsystem at block 525. The email subsystem method 520 requests the agent from the dynamic ACD at block 527. When an agent is allocated to the contact, the agent identifier is returned from the dynamic ACD to the email subsystem method 520, which, in turn, at block 529 returns the agent identifier to the email escalator to cause the contact to be routed to be identified agent. The email subsystem method 520 injects a handle-agent event into the email workflow at block 531 in response to receiving the agent-ready event from the email escalator. In one embodiment, the email subsystem method 520 generates events which create and update contact information regarding the escalated email in the database 231.<br>
A method 540 for a contact workflow for an escalated email is illustrated in FIG. 5C. When the escalated email workflow 540 begins, it requests an agent bom the email system at block 541, which causes the events previously described to occur. When the escalated email workflow 540 receives the handle-agent event at block 543, the workflow sends the email to the agent desktop at block 545 via the agent subsystem 219. As the agent is working with the escalated email message, the agent may generate events that cause the escalated email workflow 540 to perform certain functions, including updating the contact record, represented generally at block 547. When the agent is finished with the escalated email message, the escalated email workflow 540 sends a left-session event to the agent subsystem at block 549.<br>
FIG. 3C illustrates the escalation that is performed for a contact thai initially appears at the contact center 200 through a self-service Web site 341. By choosing to send an email, the contact can be escalated (represented by arrow 349) through the email manager into a deferred email contact 343. Alternatively, if the contact clicks on a collaboration/chat button, it is escalated by a combination of the workflow engine and the dynamic ACD (represented by arrow 347) into ah immediate assistance contact 345. As the sending of email is handled by the conventional email system, the escalation from a self-service contact 341 into a deferred email contact 343 is not further discussed.<br><br>

When the. collaboration router method 600 receives the agent identifier from the collaboration subsystem at block 005, then routes the collaboration session to the agent desktop for the identified agent (block 607) via the collaboration server.<br>
A coYiaboration subsystem method. lii'D executed. by the coVraboration subsystem 215 is next described in conjunction with FIG. 6D. The collaboration subsystem method 620 receives the contact information from the collaboration router at block 621 and invokes a collaboration workflow for the contact at block 623. A contact record for the collaboration contact is also created at block 623. The collaboration subsystem method 620 receives an agent request from the collaboration workflow (block 625) and requests an agent from the dynamic ACD (block 627). When the dynamic ACD returns the agent identifier to the collaboration subsystem method' 620, it returns the agent identifier to the collaboration router (block 629) for routing the collaboration session to the appropriate agent's desktop. The collaboration subsystem method 620 also injects a handle-agent event into the collaboration workflow at block 623. Events resulting from the collaboration session are injected into the workflow by the collaboration subsystem method 620 when the session terminates (block 633). In one embodiment, the collaboration subsystem method 620 generates events which create and update contact information regarding the collaboration session in the database 231.<br>
Turning now to HCJ. 6C, a collaboration workflow method 640 that is executed by the workflow logic 207 as a collaboration workflow for a contact is described. When the collaboration workflow method 640 begins, it requests an agent from the . collaboration subsystem at block 641. The collaboration workflow method 640 receives a handle-agent event from 'he collaboration subsystem at block 643. The handle-agent event informs the workflow that the agent is now ready for the collaboration session and collaboration workflow method 640 sends the contact information to the agent desktop (block 645) via the agent 219 subsystem.

The agcnl desktop method 700 receives a login event when an agent logs into the contact center (block 701). The agent desktop method 700 sends the agent information into the agent subsystem .'.19 at block 70T As pail ol thru pioccsing, the agcnl subsystem ',',19 and the agent workflow 207 make the agent available lor contacts. The agent desktop melhud 700 waits for messages from the agent and the agent, subsystem at block 705.   II the . .agent desktop method 700 receives the routed contacts (block 707), it passes the contact information ont.o to appropriate underlying system (such as the email system and the collaboration s-y.siem) at block 709.   When the appropriate system has terminated the contact, the agent desktop method 700 leceives a wrap-up event from the agent Subsystem (block 711), which causes it to put the agent into a wrap-up stale (block 71 .\). The agent desktop method 700 sends an end-of-wrap up event Lo the agent subsystem at block 715 when the agent lias finished the contact wrap up procedures.<br>
The agent desktop method 700 also handles the transition of the agent into various states such as break, logout, etc. If the agent is requesting a break (block 717), the agent desktop method 700 sends the break icqucst lo the agent subsystem (block 719), which forwards it onto the agcnl workflow for a decision (as described further below). If the break request is allowed (biock 721), the agent desktop method 700 waits for 111 e agent to return from break and sends an off-break event to the agent subsystem to inform it that the agent is again available, (block 7.'J).<br>
If the agent is logging out (block 725), the agent desktop method 700 semis an agent-logout event into the agent subsystem at block 729,  All other messages are sent to the agent subsystem at block 727.  One of skill in the art will readily understand the processing necessary to transition the agent into oilier states without furl her illustration<br>

If I he. event is a contact request fiom the agent win il low (block 7 W&gt;), the agent subsystem method 730 checks to see if there is a pending break request from the agent desktop (block 737). If not, the agent subsystem method 730 requests a contact lor the agent from the dynamic ACD at block 739. Once the dynamic ACD returns a contact, the agent subsystem method 730 injects a handle contact event into the agent workflow (block 740). When the agent or the contact terminates the call oi the session, the agent subsystem method 730 receives a left-session event from the corresponding contact workflow, i.e., the voice workflow, the email workflow, or the collaboration workflow, at block 741, and injects the event into the agent workflow at block 742. The agent subsystem method 730, in conjunction with the current session or call, also receives a wrap-up event from the agent workflow (block 743), which it sends to the agent desktop (block 745). When the agent desktop has determined that the agent is completely wrapped up the contact, the agent subsystem method 730 receives the end-wrap-up event from the agent desktop at block 746, and in turn, injects the event into the agent workflow at block 747. If a break request is pending (block 737), the agent subsystem .method 730 waits until the agent workflow makes a decision on the break request (block 748). If allowed, the agent subsystem method 730 waits at block 735 for an off-break event from the agent desktop. If not allowed, the agent subsystem method 730 requests a contact from the dynamic ACD at block 739,<br>
If the agent subsystem method 730 receives a break request from the agent desktop (block 749), it sends an on-break event to the agent workflow (block 770) and waits for a tesponsc, which it forwards to the agent desktop at block 75 I.  If the break is allowed by the agent workflow (block 752), the agent subsystem method 730 requests the agent be removed from the agent list by the dynamic ACD at block 753 and waits a block 735 for an off-break event from the agent desktop. When the off-break event is received (block 754), the agent subsystem method 720 injects the off-break event into the agent workflow at block 755 to cause the workflow to request a contact for the now-available agent,<br>
If a logout eve.nl is received (block 75(&gt;), the agent .subsystem method 730 requests the agent be removed from the agent list by the dynamic ACD (block 759) and<br><br>
The agent subsystem method 730 invokes an agent workflow from llie workflow engine 201 at block 733 and.waits for events from the agent workflow and the agent desktop 229 (block 735).  If the event is a contact request from the agent workflow (block 73d), the agent subsystem method 730 checks to see if there is a pending break request from the agent desktop (block 737). If noL, the agent subsystem method 730 requests a contact for the agent from the dynamic ACD at block 739, Once the dynamic ACD returns a contact, the agent subsystem method 730 injects a handle contact event into the agent workflow (block 740). When the agent or the contact terminates the call or the session, •   the agent subsystem method 730 receives a left-session event from the corresponding contact workflow, j.e,, the voice workflow, the email workflow, or the collaboration workflow, at block 741, and injects the event into the agent workflow at block 742. The agent subsystem method 730, in conjunction with the current session or call, also receives a wrap-up event from the agent workflow (block 743), which it sends to the agent desktop (block 745). When the agent desktop has determined that the agent is completely wrapped up the contact, the agent subsystem method 730 receives the end-wrap-up event from the agent desktop at block 746, and in turn, injects the event into the agent workflow at block 747. If a break request is pending (block 737), the agent subsystem method 730 waits until the agent workflow makes a decision on the break request (block 748).

It will be appreciated that the workflows described in conjunction with the How charts 40, 5C, 6C and 7C arc simplified examples of the actions available through the woikllow logic 20/ anil an-, mil intended lo linul 11 if. invention In only llnr.r ;n:iious ;uul sequences illustrated. A detailed description of one embodiment of the workflow logic 207 and the workflow actions is given in the next section.<br>
In addition, one of skill in the art will readily conceive of alternate logic flows with more or fewer processes or different processes that achieve the results of these method and such alternatives are considered within the scope of the invention. For example, instead of having the contact workflows inject the left-session events directly into the agent workflow, in one .alternate embodiment, the contact workflow sends a contact-ended event to the contact subsystem and thence to the appropiiate media router, which causes the router to send the left-session event to the agent subsystem for injection into the agent workflow. In another alternate embodiment, the termination of the contact workflow causes the contact subsystem to send the contact-ended event to the appropriate media router, causing the router lo send the left-session event lo the agent subsystem and thence to the agent workflow.<br>
The particular methods performed by components of one embodiment of the digital multimedia contact center of the present invention have been described in terms of media-specific processing diagrams and flowcharts.

Internet Contact Center (iC'C) liypjenicnjalion<br>
In this section of the detailed description, a particular implementation of the invention is described. Companies subscribe to the services of the IC 'C to manage their customer contacts. The iCC is sited remotely from the agents for the subscriber, who may be at various locations. The agent desktops 229 arc Web browser-based that connect to the agent subsystem(s) 219 in the remote iCC. The subscriber's customers contact the iCC directly through the Internet or POTS and are then routed to the appropriate agent desktop through a virtual pi ivale network. The browser-based agent desktops enables llic use of various plug-in applets thai extend the basic capabilities of the agent desktop without extensive re-programming. Additionally, a combination Java applel/servlct can be used to implement the desktop manager described previously.<br>
Messaging<br>
Communication between the workflow engine 201 and the media routers 221/agent desktop 229 is handled through a set of interfaces using Java RM1 (remote method invocation). Three generic interfaces are provided in a messaging library. All contact workflow subsystems, e.g., voice subsystem 213, collaboration subsystem 215 and email subsystem 217, are required to implement at least a generic contact service interface, such as "ContactWorkflowServicelntcrface" described below. All agent workflow subsystems, e.g. the agent subsystem 219, are required to implement at least a generic agent service interface, such as "AgentWorkflowServicelnterfacc" described below   Each media router 221 is required to implement at least a generic media router interface, such as "MediaKouterlnterface" described below. New inlcrlaces specific to the service requested can be defined that inherit from existing interfaces. Thus, for example, a voice service interface implements the generic contact service interface along with interfaces for telephony commands. Global variables pass information between the workflow subsystems 205 and the workflow logic 207. The global variables contain the values needed by the workflow logic 207 in the context of a particular workflow, and requests made by the workflow logic 207 to the workflow subsystems 205 through various workflow steps described further below,<br>
A media router 221 uses the ContactWorkflowServicefnterface of a particular contact workflow subsystem to 1) start a contact workflow and receive a contact identifier for the workflow, 2) inject an event into an existing workflow identified by a<br><br>
contact identifier, and 3) determine if the contact woikflow subsystcMi is handling ;i specified contact. To start a woikflow lor a contact, a media muter 221 invokes a "sturtWorkflow" method in the ContactWoi'kflow.ServiceliUerfacc of the desired contact workflow subsystem, passing in an identifier for the media router interface of the media router (client), and the attributes of the contact (attributes), and receives an identifier for the. newly created contact workflow in return (contactID), e.g.,<br>
startWorkflow(clicnt, contactID, attributes). To inject an event into an existing workflow, a media router 221 invokes an "injcclKvent" method in the ContaclWorkflowServicelnterfacc of the appropriate, contact workflow subsystem, identifying the contact workflow (contactID) and the event to be injected into the workflow (event), e.g.,<br>
injectEvent(contactlD, event). To determine if a particular contact workflow subsystem is handling a specific contact, a media router calls a "handlesContact" method in the ContactWorkflowServiccInterfacc of the contact workflow subsystem, passing in the identifier of the contact workflow (contactID) and receives a boolean value in return, e.g.,<br>
handlcsContact(contactld). An agent desktop 229 uses the AgentWorkflowServicelnicrl'acc to 1) start an agent workflow and receive an agent identifier for the workflow, 2) inject an event into . an existing workflow identified by an agent identifier, and 3) determine if a particular agent workflow subsystem is managing a specified agent. As described previously, when multiple agent workflow subsystem are present, an agent desktop is assigned to one of the agent workflow subsystems by a service manager. To start an agent workflow, an agent desktop invokes a "startWorkflow" method in theAgentWorkflowServicelnterface of the appropriate agent workflow subsystem, passing in the attributes of the agent (attributes), and receives an identifier for the newly created agent workflow in return (ngcnllD), e.g.,<br>
startWorkflow(agentfD, attributes). To inject an event into an existing workflow, an agent desktop invokes an "injeciEvent" method in the AgcntWorkfiowScrvicelnterfacc of the appropriate agent workflow subsystem, identifying the agent workflow (agcntID) and the event to be injected into the workflow (event), e.g.,<br><br>
injccfLveiit(agciitll), even I). To determine if a particular agent workflow subsystem is handling a specific agent, an agent desktop calls a "haiullesAgenl" method in the A gen I WoikflowSei vieelnlei lace of uV ;igrnl workflow subsystem, passing in the identifier of ibe agent workflow (ageniin) ami receives a boolean value in return, e.g., handles Agent(agentld).<br>
The McdiaRoutcrlntcrfacc allows contact workflow subsystems to route contacts to the agents allocated by the dynamic ACD and to terminate a contact session. To route a contact to an agent, a contact workflow subsystem invokes an "assignContactToAgent" method in the MediuRouterlnterface of the appropriate media router, passing in the workflow identifier for the contact (contactJOD) and the workflow identifier for the agent (agcntlD) and receiving a boolean in return that indicates whether the routing was successful, e.g.,<br>
assignContactToAgent(contactlD, agcntlD). To terminate a contact session, a contact workflow subsystem invokes a "terminateContact" method in the iCCMcdiaRouterlnterface of the appropriate media router, passing in the workflow identifier for the contact (contactlD), e.g., terminateContact(contactlD).<br>
Database Unification Layer<br>
The database unification layer 261 implements a unified schema consisting of information replicated from a number of different sources including the databases used by the third-party systems, and the internal iCC database 231 as described previously. Each different source is defined in a sub-schema including:<br>
■	Billing<br>
■	Customer Relationship Management (CRM)<br>
■	Entitlement (Billing option, maximum agents, maximum contacts, ,..)<br>
■	Provisioning (Agents, User IDs, Passwords, Classifications, Skills, Proficiencies, ...)<br>
■	Business Logic (Priority Expressions, Attributes, Stored Procedures, ...)<br>
■	Active State (Agent Stale, Session Slate, Contact Stale, Contact Center State, Customer State).<br><br>
Tlic database unification layer provides access to the information in the various databases through Java classes, such as CRM, Provisioning, Entitlement, Rules. Contact Delnil Record (CDR). Contact Conk-r Slate.<br>
Tl\e unified schema is synchronized with the vendor-specific sources by a set of database liiggcis. l;oi instance, many conventional email systems use event handlers thai watch for messages entering and changing state, ;md create and update CDN records as necessary, e.g. when an email message is responded to or forwarded to anothci agent. Updating one of the sources with information in the unified schema is accomplished through the Java classes.<br>
One embodiment o( a data structure 800 for a CDR is illustrated in lvIG. 8A. The contact represented by the CDR 800 is identified through a contact ID field 801. The media type through which the contact entered the iCC is specified in a media type field 803. Assuming the contact has been classified, the classification for the contact is stored in a contact class ID field 805. If the iCC is implemented in conjunction with a standard customer relationship management system, the CRM case identifier is stored in a case 11) field 807 to allow tracking of the contact. The agent assigned to handle the contact is identified through an assigned agent ID field 809. One or more fields 811 collectively record the history of the contact as it is process in the iCC. Each field till contains a contact state 813 and a timestamp 815. Thus, the change in state of the contact can be tracked chronologically for the life of the contact.  Exemplary contact states used by the iCC are shown in Table 1 below and it will be appreciated that more or fewer sLates may be used.<br><br><br><br>
Tabic I: i('(   ('oiiliirl Slates<br>
One embodiment of a dala structure 820 lor an agent record is illustrated in FIG. 8B. The agent represented by the agent record 820 is identified by an agent ID field 821, Assuming the agent has been classified, the classification for the agent is stored in an agent class ID field 823. The contact identifier for the current contact the agent is handling is stored in an assigned contact ID field 825. One or more fields 827 collectively record the history of the agent while he or she is logged into the iCC. Fach field 827 contains an agent state 829 and a timestamp 831. Thus, the change in state of the agent can be tracked chronologically during the workday of the agent. The agent stales used by the iCC are shown in Table 2 below and it will be appreciated that more or fewer states may be used.<br><br>
Table 2: iCC Agent States<br>
Soft ACD<br>
The iCC uses a software-implemented ACD to manage the allocation of all contacts and agents. The Soft ACD exists as a set of stored procedures in the contact center database that refer to special database tables used as the unordered lists of available agents and waiting contacts. The unordered lists may be further logically subdivided, e.g., by classification.<br>
The Soft ACD also loads business logic and provisioning information (described below) when required. Each classification within the organization (e.g.. Sales, Support, Customer Service, etc.) is associated with a particular set of business logic. If any of this<br><br>
information changes, the Soft ACD is notified, it reloads this iiitoiina'tioii, and immediately applies the new information to the iCC. While it is running, the Soft ACD<br>

When a tunning workflow requests an agent or contact, the appmpriale subsystem passes the request onto the Soft ACD as previously described. The Soft ACL) determines the best match for the agent or contact by filtering the opposite list on classification and in light of any requirements specified in the request, and prioritizing the filtered entries using one or more "priority expressions." Each priority expicssion contains a set of weighted contact/agent attributes that produce a priority from 0 to 100 when an entry is evaluated. The attributes and their weights exist as classes in the business logic sub-schema in the database unification layer and are described next.   It should be noted that the Soft ACD dynamically performs the filtering and prioritizing anew for each request for a match.<br>
While a contact or agent is waiting on a list, the requesting workflow is tree to continue executing, but when an actual allocation occurs, a resource allocator notifies the corresponding subsystem, which then interrupts the requesting workflow to route the contact.<br>
Business Logic<br>
The business logic used by the iCC for a subscriber is defined through an email manager, a workflow editor, and an administrative interface. The email manager is used to create email rules that route email contacts into various predefined mailboxes. These rules may reference text in the from, to, subject and body of the message as well as make database queries. Mailbox queues are separate message areas maintained by the email server. Agents retrieve messages from these queues. Individual queues can be set up, e.g., for each agent or for separate products, and additions or deletions to the existing set of queries can be made as necessary. For example, the subscriber could initially define one queue per product per classification ("SaleslYmters" or "SiipportlYinieis") and add more as business grows. The system administrator grants access to these queues on a per agent basis. An additional queue is defined for escalated email messages as previously described. After defining the queues, the rules which route messages into those queues are defined. Rules can also be specified that demote certain email messages into self-service by routing them to the auto-responder function.<br><br>
Tin: workflow editor defines a workflow lor handling a contact or an agent. A subscriber may defined any iiuuibei' of agent and contact workflows through the workflow editor,   For example, each agent might have a patliriilai woikllnw kasitl u Llie agent's login identifier. The workflows and their related invocation information are si oied for refrifiiec by (lie Work I low engine .'01 in an i ,1 )AI' diuvtoi y scivei 01 oilier directory structure. that defines hierarchical directory entries.

The administrative interface uses the classes in the business logic sub-schema to define logins, passwords, agent skills and proficiencies, call center classifications, service level objectives, email overdue/escalation thresholds, priority expressions, attributes, attribute weightings, etc. When the administrative interface starts up, it reads the system and subscriber business logic from the database using the business logic<br><br>
classes. When entities arc clian^ccl, the relevant data is written back lo the database through these same business logic classes.   The administrative interlace presents the subscriber wilb various graphical usei inleilnre ((il H) scuvn to assist the user in defining the subscriber business logic.<br>
Through one of the GUI screens, the subscriber sets up the. call center classifications, which define gross distinctions between contacts or between agents. The same set of classifications is used for both contacts and agents. Within a particular classification, the subscriber defines service level objectives for each media type. Service level objectives are defined as the percentage of contacts of a particular media type which must be handled in a specific time. Thus, the GUI screen for defining service level objectives presents the user with a list of the media types, an input area for a percentage value, and an input area for an elapsed time value.<br>
Each agent has a set of skills and a proficiency within each skill, which are specified and modified through the administrative interface. When a contact requests an agent, certain skills/proficiencies may be specified as contact requirements. The requirements may also include aging information for relaxing those requirements after a certain amount of time has elapsed without the contact being helped. For instance, the aging information might say that for the first 30 seconds a particular voice call will accept a proficiency of 5 for a particular skill, after 30 seconds a proficiency of 2 will be acceptable. This is referred to as "aging" a requirement.<br>
The iCC comes pre-configured with u number of system defined attributes including:<br>
TimelnQueue - the time a contact has been waiting for a resource (available through a database stored procedure and calculated on the fly by the Software AGO.)<br>
TsEmail - is this contact an email?<br>
Is Voice - is this contact a voice call?<br>
IsColiaboration - is this contact a web collaboration?<br>
MediaServiceLcvel - percentage of contacts of this media type handled within the specified media-specific service objective<br>

normalisation, and coi responding stored procedure. '1 lie subscriber dehncs die set of attributes using a GUI screen that prompts the user for input by displaying permitted choices or through visual clues, such as a choice of normalization curves. The stored procedure for an attribute calculates a value for the attribute when the attribute is used in a priority expression. The stored procedures can have been previously created or may be created when the attribute is created.<br>
The agent and contact priority expressions arc created through a graphical user interface that allows an administrator to drag-and-drop desired attributes into an expression and set their weighting through slider bars. There is one priority expression for agents and one for contacts within each classification. When a new priority expression is specified, a new stored procedure is generated in a database scripting language, such asPL/SQL, compiled, and added to the database. One exemplary priority expression is shown in the following pseudocode: For each attribute:<br>
Call the attribute's stored procedure passing ContactlD and CustomerlD;<br>
If value returned is-1. use the attribute's default value;<br>
If the attribute is symbolic, convert to a normalized value;<br>
Multiply result by specified weighting and add this to the accumulated<br>
total.<br>
Tor a more specific example, assume a subscriber specified two classifications "Sales" and "Support" and a contact attribute called "BusinessValue" (i.e., the value of this contact to the subscriber's business). For the Sales classification, the subscriber created a contact priority expression of:<br>
BusinessValue*0.2 + TimeInQueue*0.1 + IsEmail*0.1 + IsVoice*0.4 +<br>
IsCollaboration*0.2<br>
and for die Suppoil classification, a coiilael piiouly oxpicssioii of.<br><br>
Busiiics.sValue"'0.1 + 'l'iinc.'liiOucuL'"u. I  i lsHiiuiil'lU f + Is Voice'().(&gt; -I isCollaboration*0.1.<br>
When the Soft ACD is prioritizing the waiting contacts for assignment to an agent, it evaluates the expression for each contact of the appropriate classification by calling the stored procedure associated with the BusinessValue attribute and multiplying the value returned by 0.2 for a Sales contact or 0.1 for a Support contact. The weighted business value of the contact is then added to the appropriately weighted values of the system defined attributes to calculate the priority for the contact.<br>
The Soft ACD can prioritize each agent/contact before deciding on the appropriate match or alternately may employ an optimization scheme in which the first agent/contact that reaches a pre-determined priority value is chosen.<br>
Provisioning Information<br>
The underlying components of iCC must set up and configuied before the center is ready for operation. The email manager allows administrators lo define agents, agent passwords, mailboxes, as well as the rules by which contacts are routed to these mailboxes. An administration interface to the collaboration server is used to define agents, agent passwords, and agent extensions. The telephony server is set up by creating dial plans and associating phone numbers with applications, and agents with . phone extensions.<br>
Workflow Engine<br>
The iCC uses workflows to process contact, manage agents, and control the overall contact center functions. Workflow steps arc the basic building blocks of control in the iCC workflow engine. The workflow steps available lo a designer depend on the type of workflow being developed. For example, voice workflow steps include answer, collect digits, and record. Exemplary agent workflow steps include allow break, handle contact, and wrap up. Some workflow steps are applicable to all contact workflows, such as classify contact, request agent, and deliver contact. Control steps, e.g. end, wait, and if, are available for all workflows, along with a send email step. Additional slops for the contact and agent workflows will he readily apparent to one of skill in the art.<br>
Instead of hard-coded scripts typically used to implement workflows, the iCC workflow engine 900 dynamically creates a script for a workflow from two files as<br><br>
described in unijunction with FK.l. 9A.  Definitions I'oi pioiotypc nodes VI I, 913, 915, 917, 919 arc stored in a template tile 903. Uach node is associated with workflow code that implements a high-level, compound script action, such as "play menu with interrupliblc prompts" or "play music until an agent is available," that are available to the workflow engine 900. The script actions are built from workflow steps. For case of explanation, the script actions represented in FIG. 9A are simple, single commands, e.g., node A 911 represents the function "if(x boolean y)," where "x," "boolean," and "y" arc parameters that will be replaced by values specified by an instance of the node A 911. It will be appreciated that the invention is not limited by the exampleor by the workflow steps shown herein.<br>
When in configuration mode 901, the workflow engine 900 (or a supporting application) enables a user, such as a system administrator, to create a workflow 905 by selecting the appropriate nodes from the template file 903, specifying the appropriate values for the parameters in the script command, and linking the nodes together to form a directed graph that represents the desired workflow. Thus, lor example, when node A' 921 is executed, the function "if(number 
When the workfl ow 905 is to be executed by the workflow engine 900 in run¬time mode 909, the workflow engine 900 references the configuration file 907 and reconstructs the directed graph for the workflow 905 in memory by merging the corresponding prototype nodes from the template file 903 with the configuration data associated with the nodes in the configuration file 907. The workflow engine initiates a new thread of execution to execute the workflow script represented by the directed<br><br>
graph, Thus, ihc workflow engine 900 abstracts out the code anil connectors when the user creates a work/low and .subsequently reconstructs (he workflow from die abstractions when it is to be executed.<br>
Unlike typical workflow implementations, all iCC workflow steps can execute asynchronously by storing its result to a prioritized message queue in its thread of execution. Additionally, step may spawn another execution thread to create a multithreaded workflow. Similar classes of steps may share one queue with one execution thread for all requests of that type from a single workflow or across workflows. As previously described, various workflow steps request a service from a subsystem. The, subsystems inject service events into the workflow by placing event notifications in the message queue. The retrieval of messuges from the queue is implemented using three special workflow steps: RegisterEvent, UnRegisterEvent, and GetMessage.<br>
RegisterEvent and UnRegisterEvent modify handlers for events. By default, an event is handled in-line in the node that caused the event. Rcgisicrlivent specifies a target node thai will handle the event instead (referred to as "chaining"). Handlers are stacks: when a handler is registered using RegisterEvent, the target node for that event is pushed onto the stack; when UnRegisterEvent is called, the stack is popped.<br>
The GetMessage step fetches a message from the queue. When the message is an event notification for which a registration (via RegisterEvent) has been made, the workflow engine branches to the target node to handle the event.   If the event was not explicitly registered, the current node is pushed onto the slack lo handle Ihc cvcul.<br>
An example of the asynchronous processing of the workflow steps is illustrated in FIG. 9B. A workflow 904 begins at node A A 941. As part of its code, node A A 941 requests (arrow 951) that the database subsystem retrieve a record from the unified database 957. When the record is retrieved, the database subsystem stores (arrow 953) an event notification in a message queue 959. Instead of waiting for the database subsystem to retrieve the record, the node AA 941 registers itself as the target node to handle the event. The workflow continues processing, executing node LJB 943 and node CC 945, before reaching node DD 947, which requests (arrow 955) messages from a queue 959. Assuming that the event notification is in the queue 959, it will be returned (airow 955) to node DD 947, which in turns, returns (edge 967) the event notification to<br><br>
node AA 94 I lor handling. Once node A A 94 I has received the record, u passes (edge 969) it onto node CIS 949 Tor furlher processing.<br>
In one embodiment, the template and configuration files are XML documents, with the nodes represented by XML elements, and the code and configuration information stored as XML attributes for the corresponding XML elements. The code and configuration information arc written in the JPython scripting language, A JPython-aware execution proxy merges the information from the template and configuration files, and provides an interface between the thread of execution for the workflow and the actual workflow steps. Because the execution proxy insulates the thread of execution from the workflow steps, steps may use multiple scripting languages simultaneously, allowing the developer of the prototype nodes to chose the best code to perform a given function.<br>
Operating Environment<br>
The following description of FIGs. 10A-B is intended to provide an overview of computer hardware and other operating components suitable for implementing the invention, but is not intended to limit the applicable environments. One of skill in the art will immediately appreciate that the invention can be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network.<br>
FIG. 10A shows several computer systems 1 that arc coupled together through a network 3, such as the Internet. The term "Internet" as used herein refers to a network of networks which uses certain protocols, such as the TCP/IP protocol, and possibly other . protocols such*as the hypertext transfer protocol (1T1TP) for hypertext markup language (HTML) documents that make up the World Wide Web (web). The physical connections of the Internet and the protocols and communication procedures of the Internet are well-known to those of skill in the art. Access to the Internet 3 is typically provided by Internet service providers (ISP), such as the ISPs 5 and 7. Users on client systems, such as client computer systems 21, 25, 35, and 37 obtain access to the Internet<br><br>
through the Internet service providers, such as ISPs 5 and 7. Access to the Internet allows users of the client computer systems to exchange information, receive and send c-mails, and view documents, such as documents which have been prepared in the HTML format. These documents are often provided by web servers, such as web server 9 which is considered to be "on" the Internet. Often these web servers are provided by the ISPs, such as ISP 5, although a computer system can be set up and connected to the Internet without that system being also an ISP as is well known in the art.<br>
The web server 9 is typically at least one computer system which operates as a server computer system and is configured to operate with the protocols of the World Wide Web and is coupled to the Internet. Optionally, the web server 9 can be part of an ISP which provides access to the Internet for client systems. The web server 9 is shown coupled to the server computer system 11 which itself is coupled to web content 10, which can be considered a form of a media database. It will be appreciated that while two computer systems 9 and 11 ate shown in FIG. 10A, the web server system 9 and the server computer system 11 can be one computer system having ddlerenl software components providing the web server functionality and the server functionality provided by the server computer system 11 which will be described further below.<br>
Client computer systems 21, 25, 35, and 37 can each, with the appropriate web browsing software, view HTML pages provided by the web server 9. The ISP 5 provides Internet connectivity to the client computer system 21 through the modem interface 23 which can be considered part of the client computer system 21. The client computer system can be a personal computer system, a network computer, a Web TV system, or other such computer system. Similarly, the ISP 7 provides Internet connectivity for client systems 25, 35, and 37, although as shown in FIG. 10A, the connections are not the same for these three computer systems. Client computer system 25 is coupled through a modem interface 27 while client computer systems 35 and 37 are part of a LAN. While FIG. 10A shows the interfaces 23 and 27 as gencrically as a "modem," it will be appreciated that each of these interfaces can be an analog modem, ISDN modem, cable modem, satellite transmission interface (e.g. "Direct PC"), or other interfaces for coupling a computer system to other computer systems. Client computer systems 35 and 37 are coupled to a LAN 33 through network interfaces 39 and 41, which can be Ethernet network or other network interfaces. The LAN 33 is also coupled to a gateway computer<br><br>
system 31 which can provide liiewall and other Internet related sei vices loi the local aiea network. This gateway computer system 31 is coupled to the ISP 7 to provide Internet connectivity to the client computer systems 35 and 37. The gateway computer system 31 can be a conventional server computer system. Also, the web server system 9 can be a conventional server computer system.<br>
Alternatively, as well-known, a server computer system 43 can DC directly coupled to the LAN 33 through a network interface 45 to provide files 47 and other services to the clients 35, 37, without the need to connect to the Internet through the gateway system 31.<br>
FIG. 10B shows one example of a conventional computer system that can be used as a client computer system or a server computer system or as a web server system. It will also be appreciated that such a computer system can be used to perform many of the functions of an Internet service provider, such as ISP 105. The computer system 51 interfaces to external systems through the modem or network interface 53. It will be appreciated that the modem or network interface 53 can be considered to be part of the computer system 51. This interface 53 can be an analog modem, ISDN modem, cable modem, token ring interface, satellite transmission interface (e.g. "Direct PC"), or other interfaces for coupling a computer system to other computer systems. The computer system 51 includes a processor 55, which can be a conventional microprocessor such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor or Motorola Power PC microprocessor. Memory 59 is coupled to the processor 55 by a bus 57. Memory 59 can be dynamic random access memory (DRAM) andean also include static RAM (SRAM). The bus 57 couples the processor 55 to the memory 59 and also to non-volatile storage 65 and to display controller 61 and to the input/output (I/O) controller 67. The display controller 61 controls in the conventional manner a display on a display device 63 which can be a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display. The input/output devices 69 can include a keyboard, disk drives, printers, a scanner, and other input and output devices, including a mouse or other pointing device. The display controller 61 and the I/O controller 67 can be implemented with conventional well known technology. A digital image input device 71 can be a digital camera which is coupled to an I/O controller 67 in order to allow images from the digital camera to be input into the computer system 51. The non-volatile storage 65 is often a magnetic hard disk, an optical disk, or another<br><br>
farm of storage for large amounts of data. Some of this data is often wnileii, by a diiecl memory access process, into memory 59 during execution of software in the computer system 51. One of skill in the art will immediately recognize that the term "compulcr-rcadable medium" includes any type of storage device that is accessible by the processor 55 and also encompasses a carrier wave that encodes a data signal.<br>
It will be appreciated that the computer system 51 is one example of many possible computer systems which have different architectures. For example, personal computers based on an Intel microprocessor often have multiple buses, one of which can be an input/output. (I/O) bus for the peripherals and one that directly connects the processor 55 and the memory x59 (often referred to as a memory bus). The buses are connected together through bridge components that perform any necessary translation due to differing bus protocols.<br>
Network computers arc another type of computer system that can be used with the present invention. Network computers do not usually include a hard disk or other mass storage, and the executable programs are loaded from a network connection into the memory 59 for execution by the processor 55. A Web TV system, which is known in the art-, is also considered to be a computer system according to the present invention, but it may lack some of the features shown in FIG. 1013, such as certain input or output devices. A typical computer system will usually include at least a processor, memory, and a bus coupling the memory to the processor.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the computer system 51 is controlled by operating system software which includes a file management system, such as a disk operating system, which is part of the operating system software. One example o( an operating system software with its associated file management system software is the Windows family of operating systems from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington, and the associated file management systems. The file management system is typically stored in the non-volatile storage 65 and causes the processor 55 to execute (lie various acts required by the operating system to input and output data and to store data in memory, including storing files on the non-volatile storage 65.<br><br>
