Fabric softener compositions comprising homo- and/ or copolymers<br>
This invention relates to fabric softener compositions comprising homo- and/or copolymers as thickeners, as well as to new fabric softener compositions.<br>

The fabric softener compositions can, for example, be prepared as follows: Firstly, an aqueous formulation of the polymer is prepared as described above.

The fabric softener composition can, for example, also be prepared by mixing a preformulated fabric softener with the polymer. It is also possible to add independently the components of the softener and the additives to the aqueous solution of the polymer (preaddition).<br>
These fabric softener compositions are traditionally prepared as dispersions containing for example up to 30 wt-% of active material in water. They usually have a turbid appearance. However, alternative formulations usually containing actives at levels of 5 to 40 % along with solvents can be prepared as microemulsions, which have a clear appearance (as to the solvents and the formulations see for example US-A-5,543,067 und WO-A-98/17757).<br>

The monomer solution was then added to the agitated continuous phase and allowed to disperse for 3 minutes. The temperature of the suspension was adjusted to 25°C. The suspension was initiated by addition of Sulphur dioxide in Solvent D40 (0.656 mi of a 1%vol/voi solution).<br>
When the exothermic reaction was completed, water was azeotroped off the suspension under reduced pressure. The resulting suspension of polymer beads was cooled to 25°C, filtered and air-dried. The obtained polymer has an average particle size of about 240^m. The size is measured with a Sympatec HELOS laser diffraction apparatus (from Sympatec GmbH, Germany).<br>
