				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention, relates to a board magazine for printed circuit boards and more specifically to a board magazine for holding a plurality of printed circuit boards in an operative array with electrical connections between the printed circuit boards and to the surround¬ings .<br>
In larger electronic systems, it. is common to build the systems on a plurality of printed circuit boards arranged in holders from which the printed circuit boards can be rem.oved and exchanged individually, and in which the printed circuit boards/ when inserted, obtain electrical connections through a plug expediently arranged at an edge of the printed circuit board. The mating part of the printed circuit board plug nay expediently be provided on a special printed circuit board which will be fixedly mounted in Ihe meyazine in many cases.<br>
It is expedient to arrange the printed circuit boards such that they are vertical and mutually parallel with aic gaps between them thereby achieving a natural cool¬ing air circulation, provided the magazine itself is focned with $uitable openings. If the fixed printed cir¬cuit beard connection is likewise arranged vertically, it<br>
is ensured that said connection, will not obstruct the n i r circulation.<br>
Ths document JP 5-18 13 72 A discloses a printed circuit board arrangement comprising a mother board which is slightly inclined and. which has downwardly directed, ver¬tically arranged printed circuit boards mounted thereon. 11 is stated that; the stepped arrangement gives room for the storage of cables, and it is inentioned that. the non-used spac  contr butes to the  heat: dissipation on<br><br>
The prior art comprises board nsgazines Tor a large num¬ber of printed circuit boards held such that  they are ar¬ranged in a pattern forming two stacks - one stack of vertical printed circuit boards and one stack of horizon¬tal printed circuit boards - said two stacks interfacing at a partition panel, said printed circuit boards having plug connections to the partition panel. This arrangement makes it relativaly simple to provide connections between all the printed circuit boards, as any printed circuit board in one stack has a point of intersection adjacent any one o;c the boards in the other stack where direct connections may be established through plugs.<br>
In this known arrangement, cooling of the printed circuit boards in the vertical stack is favoured by the -natural air circulation. This, however, does not apply to the printed circuit boards in the opposite stack in which thay are positioned horizontally. These printed circuit boards have quite different thermal conditions, and in practice it is necessary to provide for forced air circu¬lation to achieve satisfactory cooling of the boards in the other stack.<br>
The invention provic.es a board magazine as defined in claim 1,<br>
With this board magazine, the printed circuit boards in both magazines will be cooled by natural air circulation.<br>
According to expedient embodiments/ the board ir.agazine may be arranged completely symnetrically so that the con¬ditions a::e the sa~* for the printed circuit boards in bcth stacks. For example, all boards may stand at: an •srgle of 4 5" to 'the  horizontal except the partition panel. which is  vertical How ever the invention does not<br>
prerequisite; in prs.ctice/ natural air circulation is achieved already at a smaller angle to the horizontal.<br>
The inclined arrangement of the printed circuit boards in both board magazines implies that within an ordinary rack having horizontal and vertical partition faces there will be some corner dieas which cannot be filled with printed circuit boards. However, these corner areas may expedi¬ently be used for electronic equipment which does not have to be provided on exchangeable printed circuit boards; e.g. cable connections/ power supplies, etc., and therefore these corners do not necessarily represent wasted space. Compared with the prior art,, a further space saving is achieved in that blowers for cooling need not be provided.<br>
According to expedient embodiments, the partition panel is provided with electric plugs for each individual printed circuit board and with a suitable system of con¬ductor paths which interconnect the individual plugs/ no matter whether they are provided on the sax.e side or op¬posite sides of the partition panel.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a board magazine for<br>
printed circuit boards, comprising holdersiprovided to hold a plurality of<br>
T*<br>
substantially planar parallel printed circuit boards in a pattern forming two stacks, wherein each stack comprises two or more printed circuit boards provided mutually in parallel, wherein an edge of the boards in one stack faces toward and is perpendicular to an edge of the boards in the other stack, and wherein electrical connections may be provided from any board in one stack to one or more boards in the other stack, characterized in that the holders are provided to hold the printed circuit boards in a position of use such that the printed circuit boards are inclined with respect to the horizontal.<br>
Further the details and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description of an embodiment thereof given with reference to the accompanying drawings in which,<br>
Fig. 1 is a vertical front view of a rack having a magazine according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 is an isometric view illustrating the orientation of some printed circuit boards within the magazine of fig. 1, and<br>
Fig, 3 is a front view of a plug connection used in the magazine.<br>
All figures are schematic and simplified and not neces¬sarily to scale. The figures only show details which are essential to the unclerstanding of the invention, while details of a routine: nature are left out for clarity. The same reference numerals are used in all figures for iden¬tical or corresponding items.<br>
Reference is first made to figure 1 which shows a front view of a board magazine 1 according to the invention. The magazine is provided in an ordinary rack 14 defining a box-shaped volume available for the individual board magazines. This box-shaped volume is traditionally formed with hori2ontal and vertical faces. It is important ac¬cording to the invention that this magazine makes room for natural air circulation either through the top and bottom faces or optionally through openings in the side faces or in the front and rear faces.<br>
The board magazine 1 is shown in figure 1 in an outline which is a square standing on the tip, the sides of the square being designated by the reference numerals 2, 3, 4 and 5. The magazine comprises a support frame ID which hclds a plurality of printed circuit boards 6 by board railc 9. The printed circuit boards 6 shown in front view ir. figure \ extend obliquely from the side edge at the bcttom left-hand side with the reference numeral 4 to the side edge at the top right-hand side with the reference mineral 2 in figure 1. The printed circuit boards are in¬serted from the front and obtain plug connection at the partition panel 11 which is fixedly mounted in the board magazine. The printed circuit boards mentioned here to¬gether form the fron stack 7 D:: boards.<br>
AnaJ.ogciu.sly/ a plurality ci printed circuit boards are ioserted from behind, as .seen in figure 1, to achieve P.UG 'ccnection with the partetion panol 11 the  princod<br>
circuit: boards inserted from the rear are likewise seated in board rails 9 supported by the support frame 10, and they are inclined so as to extend from the sida edge at the bottom right-hand side in figure 1 (the reference nu¬meral 5) -:o the side; face at the top left-hand side in figure 1 (reference numeral 3) . These printed circuit boards are indicated by the dashed line in figure 1, The boards inserted from the rear together form the rear stack 8 of boards.<br>
It is indicated in figure 2 how the individual printed circuit boards in the front and rear stacks of boards have points of intersection with the printed circuit beards in the opposite stack. "In the preferred embodi¬ment, the printed circuit boards do not touch each other directly, but have individual contact at a board plug 12 engaging with a corresponding plug connection on the par¬tition panel 11. The partition panel 11 has electrical connections between the individual plugs.<br>
Figure 3 is a front view of a board plug 12 having 25 pins 'which may be provided on each of the printed circuit boards according to the invention.<br>
A:; indicated in figure 1, various fixed components 13, which may e.g. be cable connections, power supplies or the like, are arranged at the four corners where the printed circuit boards dc not occupy the space com¬pletely. These components are merely to miake roora for natural air circulation which occurs in the heating of the various components, the fixed ones as well as the components on ~he printed circuit boards. In the front s;ack of boards, ths air circulation moves upwards frorr. the bottom left corner in figure 1 to the top right cor¬her, whihe the air flow in the: rear stack of. boards moves<br>
upwards from the bottom right corner to the top left cor¬ner.<br>
