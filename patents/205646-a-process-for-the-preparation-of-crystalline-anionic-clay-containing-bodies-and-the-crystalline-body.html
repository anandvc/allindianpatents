ATTRITION  RESISTANT,    SHAPEID,    CRYSTALLINE  ANIONIC   CLAY-CONTAINING   BODIES<br>
The present invention pertains to shaped crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies and a process for the preparation thereof. Examples of crystalline anionic clays include hydrotalcite, meixnerite, sjogrenite, pyroaurite, stichtite, reevesite, eardleyite, manassite, and barbertonite. Crystalline anionic clays have several applications in the catalyst field and as absorbents. For most commercial applications crystalline anionic clays are formed into shaped bodies such as spheres. In all applications where shaped bodies are exposed to severe processing conditions and environments, such as oil refinery applications, separations, purifications, and absorption processes, it is of paramount importance that the integrity of the crystalline anionic clay-containing shaped bodies is kept intact and attrition is prevented.<br>
In the prior art, crystalline anionic clays are usually incorporated into binder or matrix material, in order to obtain attrition resistant shaped bodies. Commonly used binder or matrix material is alumina prepared from alumina precursors such as aluminium chlorohydrol, soluble aluminium salts, and acid dispersed pseudoboehmite; silica such as silica sols, silicates, silica-alumina cogels, and combinations thereof. Thus in EP-0 278 535 FCC additive or catalyst particles are described which are prepared by embedding hydrotalcite and optionally zeolite in a silica, silica-alumina or alumina matrix. To this end, hydrotalcite is slurried in a matrix precursor dispersion or solution and spray-dried.<br>
However, when crystalline anionic clay is embedded in a matrix, the amount of active crystalline anionic clay ending up in the resulting shaped bodies is relatively small. There are applications in which for performance reasons it is<br><br>
desired that the shaped bodies consist or mostly consist of active crystalline anionic clay. Also, by the incorporation of crystalline anionic clay into matrix material, physical properties of the crystalline anionic clay such as specific surface area, pore size distribution; etcetera may be detrimentally affected. Further, the distribution of the crystalline anionic clay within the matrix is difficult to control. Another disadvantage of having to use a matrix to obtain attrition resistant bodies is the fact that most commonly used matrix/binder materials have some chemical activity, which in certain applications can cause undesirable side reactions. For instance, one of the most commonly used binder materials in FCC catalysts and additives is silica or silica based material. These types of binders are not suitable for use in sulphur oxides removal additives, because they detrimentally affect the sulphur removal.<br>
The present Invention provides crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies which are attrition resistant without high amounts of binder having to be present. In fact, crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies are provided which can be binder-free. The crystalline anionic clay distribution within the crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies of the invention can easily be controlled as will be explained further In the description. Within the context of the present specification, the term "crystalline anionic clay" means a clay which has an X-ray diffraction pattern containing the specific X-ray diffraction pattern which characterises the specific type of anionic clay.<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies from sources comprising an aluminium source and a magnesium source, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	preparing a precursor mixture.<br>
b)	shaping the precursor mixture to obtain shaped bodies,<br>
c)	optionally thermally treating the shaped bodies, and<br>
d)	aging to obtain crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies.<br><br>
The quintessence of the present invention is that crystalline anionic day is formed after shaping. This results in very attrition resistant bodies, without the need to add a binder material.<br>
The shaped bodies can be prepared in various ways. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an aluminium source and a magnesium source are combined in a slurry to form a precursor mixture. Subsequently, said precursor mixture is shaped. The resulting shaped bodies are aged, optionally after thermal treatment, in a liquid to obtain crystalline anionic clay-containing bodies.<br><br>
mixture, shape to form bodies, and then age the shaped bodies in a liquid containing additional magnesium source to form anionic clay-containing bodies with a higher magnesium content on the outside of the shaped body.<br>
Suitable alumina sources include aluminium oxides and hydroxides such as transition alumina, aluminium trihydrate (gibbsite, bayerite) and its thermally treated forms (including flash calcined alumina), sols, amorphous alumina, (pseudo)boehmite, aluminium-containing clays such as kaolin, sepiolite, hydrotalcite, and bentonite, chemically modified bentonite, phosphated bentonite, modified clays such as metakaolin, alumina salts such as aluminium nitrate, aluminium chloride, aluminium chlorohydrate, sodium aluminate. With the preparation method according to the invention it is also possible to use.<br><br>
cruder grades of aluminium trihydrate such as BOC (Bauxite Ore Concentrate) or bauxite. When clays are used as an Al-source, it may be necessary to activate the alumina in the clay by acid or base treatment, for instance acid-treated bentonite or acid or base treated (meta)kaolin, (hydro)thermal treatment, or combinations thereof, etcetera. Acid treatment comprises treatment, with nitric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, etcetera. Thermal treatment is usually performed at temperatures ranging from 30-1000°C, preferably 200-800°C, for a time ranging from several minutes to 24 hours, preferably 1-10 hours. Also mixtures of the above-mentioned aluminium sources can be used, and said different aluminium sources can be combined in the precursor mixture in any sequence.<br><br>
in liquid when contacted with the shaped bodies. This can be done by dispersing or dissolving the aluminium source and adding it to the shaped bodies. Alternatively, the aluminium source can be added to the liquid in which the shaped bodies are aged. Also other aluminium sources then clay such as aluminium trihydrate may be pre-treated prior to the addition to the precursor mixture or prior to contacting it with the shaped bodies. Said pre-treatment may involve treatment with acid, base treatmen.t, themial and/or hydrothermal treatment all optionally in the presence of seeds or combinations thereof. It is not necessary to convert all of the aluminium source into crystalline anionic clay. Any excess aluminium will be converted into siiica-alumina, alumina (usually in the form of y-alumina or (crystalline) boehmite) and/or aluminia-magnesia during the aging step. These compounds improve the binding properties of the shaped bodies and may also provide different types of desirable functionalities for the bodies. For instance, silica-aiumina and alumina provide acid sites for catalytic cracking and alumina (crystalline) boehmite also improves the  nickel  encapsulation   capacity of the shaped  bodies.  The<br><br>
formation of, for example, (crystalline) boehmite may be promoted by adding seeds, either in the precursor mixture, in the aluminium source or during aging.<br>
Suitable magnesium sources include magnesium oxides or hydroxides such as MgO, Mg(OH)2, hydromagnesite, magnesium salts such as magnesium acetate, magnesium formate, magnesium hydroxy acetate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxy carbonate,  magnesium bicarbonate, magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, magnesium aluminate, magensium calcium silicate, magnesium calcium carbonate, magnesium-containing clays such as dolomite, saponite, sepiolite. Also mixtures of the above-mentioned magnesium sources can be used, and said different magnesium sources can be combined in the precursor mixture in any sequence and/or in any process step after the shaping step. If a magnesium source is added after the shaping step, it is preferably in liquid when contacted with the shaped bodies. This can be done by dispersing or dissolving the magnesium source and adding it to the shaped bodies. Alternatively, the magnesium source can be added to the liquid in which the shaped bodies are aged. The magnesium source may be pre-treated prior to the addition to the precursor mixture and/or prior to the addition to the shaped bodies. Said pre-treatment may comprise a thermal and/or a hydrothemial treatment, an acid treatment, a base treatment, all optionally in the presence of a seed, and/or combinations thereof. It is not necessary to convert all of the magnesium source into crystalline anionic clay. Any excess magnesium will usually be converted into brucite, magnesia or alumina-magnesia. For the sake of clarity, this excess of magnesium compounds in the shaped particle will be referred to in the description as magnesia. The presence of magnesia or alumina-magnesia in the shaped body may provide desirable functionalities to the shaped bodies. The presence of magnesia provides basic sites which render the shaped body suitable for removing or neutralising strong acid streams of gases or liquids.<br><br>
Shaped bodies containing anionic day, anionic day and magnesia or anionic day and alumina, or even anionic clay, alumina and magnesia may be used in processes involving purification and/or separation or organic compounds in hydrocarbon streams, e.g. the removal of S-compounds and/or N-compounds in the gasoline and diesel fraction in FCC. Further, said shaped bodies may be used in water treatment for removing organic and inorganic compounds for the purpose of purifying, clarifying, and separating undesirable compounds from said water streams-, including ion exchange processes. Also, said shaped bodies may be used in the treatment of gaseous streams in industrial processes to remove and separate gaseous compounds such as process gaseous streams containing chlorine, hydrochloric acid, ammonia, sulphur compounds, and phosphorous compounds.<br>
The various process steps will be described in more detail below.<br>
Preparation of the precursor mixture<br><br>
magnesium source in a liquid. In fact, ail liquids are suitable, as long as they do not detrimentally interfere with the various sources. Suitable liquids are water, ethanol, propancl, etcetera. The amount of liquid can be chosen such that a mixture with a milky substance is obtained, but also mixtures with a higher viscosity, for instance doughs, are suitable<br><br>
added in liquid. The various sources can be added in any sequence. The preparation of the precursor mixture can be carried out with or without stirring, at room temperature or elevated temperature. Optionally, the precursor mixture and/or the separate sources are homogenised by, for instance, milling. Some conversion to crystalline anionic clay may already take place upon combining the various sources, in fact, it is preferred that at least 5 wt% of the final total<br><br>
amount of anionic clay is already formed because only in this case shaped bodies with an attrion resistance high enough for application in FCC are obtaiend. It should be noted though that for the present invention it is essential that conversion also takes place after the shaping step. Usually more than 25wt%, preferably more than 50 wt%, more preferably more than 75 wt% and most preferably between 80-95 wt% of the final amount of anionic clay in the shaped body is formed after the shaping step, because then shaped bodies with the highest physical strength are obtained. The Mg:AI ratio may vary from 1:10, preferably 1 to 6, most preferably 2 to 4.<br>
If desired, organic or inorganic acids and bases, for example for control of the pH, may be added to the precursor mixture or added to any one of the aluminium source and/or magnesium source before these are added to the precursor mixture. An example of a preferred modifier is an ammonium base, because upon drying no deleterious cations remain in the anionic clay. The precursor mixture may be pre-aged prior to the shaping step. Said pre-aging temperature may range from 30 to 500°C and may be conducted under atmospheric or increased pressure such as autogeneous pressure at temperatures above 100 °C. The aging time can vary from 1 minute to several days, for instance 2-4 days. By adding specific anions to the precursor mixture and/or any of the aluminium and or magnesium source the interlayer-charge balancing anions present may be controlled. Examples of suitable anions are carbonates,    bicarbonates,    nitrates,    chlorides,    sulphates,    bisulphates,<br><br>
acetate, and mixtures thereof. It is also believed that the presence of some of these anions such as carbonate, bicarbonate, sulphate and or nitrate influences the fonning of side products such as brucite. For instance, the addition of ammonium hydroxide promotes meixnerite formation, whereas the addition of ammonium carbonate promotes hydrotalcite formation.<br><br>
Shaping<br>
Suitable shaping methods include spray-drying, pelletising, extrusion (optionally combined with kneading), beading, or any other conventional shaping method used in the catalyst and absorbent fields or combinations thereof The amount of liquid present in the precursor mixture used for shaping should be adapted to the specific shaping step to be conducted. It might be advisable to (partially) remove the liquid used in the precursor mixture and/or add additional or other liquid, and/or change the pH of the precursor mixture to make the precursor mixture gellabie and thus suitable for shaping. Various additives commonly used in the various shaping methods such as extrusion additives may be added to the precursor mixture used for shaping.<br>
Thermal treatment<br>
After shaping the shaped bodies may optionally be submitted to a thermal treatment. Such a treatment increases the physical strength of the particles. The thermal treatment can be conducted in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, in an inert atmosphere or in steam at temperatures varying from 30 to 900°C for a time ranging from a few minutes to 24 hours, preferably 1-4 hours at a temperature in the range of 500 to 600°C. As in, for instance, spray-drying a thermal treatment is inherently involved, a further thermal treatment may not be necessary.<br>
Aging<br>
In this step, the shaped bodies are immersed in a protic liquid or protic gaseous medium. During the aging step crystallisation to crystalline anionic clay takes place. Suitable protic aging liquids or gaseous media are those liquids and<br><br>
gaseous media in which the shaped bodies do not dissolve, such as water, ethanol, methanol, propanol, steam, gaseous water, gaseous ethanol, etcetera. increasing the temperature of the liquid and/or the pressure can reduce the aging time. The aging can also be conducted under autogeneous conditions. The aging temperature may range from 30 to 500°C. The aging time can vary from 1 minute to several days, for instance 4 days. For some purposes it is advantageous to conduct several aging steps, optionally with intermediate drying steps, optionally followed by calcination steps. For instance, an aging step with a temperature below 100°C may be followed by a hydrothermal aging step at a temperature above 100°C and autogeneous pressure, or vice versa. As will be described below in further detail, additives can be added before, after or during any aging step. By adding specific anions to the aging medium the interlayer-charge balancing anions present may be controlled. Examples of suitable anions are carbonates, bicarbonates, nitrates, chlorides, sulphates, bisulfates,  vanadates, tungstates, borates, phosphates, pillaring<br><br>
the presence of some of these anions such as carbonate, bicarbonate, sulphate, and/or nitrate influence the forming of side products such as brucite. For instance, the addition of ammonium hydroxide promotes meixnerite-like clay formation, whereas the addition of ammonium carbonate promotes hydrotalcite-like clay formation.<br>
For some applications it is desirable to have additives present in and/or on the shaped bodies according to the invention, both metals and non-metals, such as rare earth metals (especially Ce and La), Si, P, B, Group VI metals, Group VIII metals, noble metals such as Pt and Pd, alkaline earth metals (for instance Ca and Ba) and/or transition metals (for example Mn, Fe, Ti, V, Zr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mo, Sn). Said metals and non-metals can be added separately or in mixtures in any of the preparation steps of the invention. For instance, they can easily be<br><br>
deposited on the shaped bodies before, during, or after aging, or else they can be added to the precursor mixture and/or any of the aluminium or magnesium sources. Suitable sources of metals or non-metals are oxides, halides or any other salt, such as chlorides, nitrates, phosphates, etcetera. As mentioned above, the metals and non-metals may be added in any of the preparation steps. This can be especially advantageous for controlling the distribution of the metals and non-metals in the shaped bodies. It is even possible to calcine the shaped bodies, rehydrate them and add additional additives. With the help of additives the shaped bodies may be provided with desired functionalities, or the desired functionality may be increased by the addition of additives. The suitability of anionic day-containing shaped bodies for the removal of SOx and/or NOx compounds in FCC may be improved by the addition of Ce and/or V. The presence of V and Zn improves the suitability for removal of S-compounds in the gasoline and diesel fraction of FCC. As described above, these functionalities may also be built in by using an excess of aluminium source and/or magnesium source. A combination of these measures increases the effect.<br>
The crystalline anionic day-containing bodies may also be prepared to contain conventional catalyst components such as matrix or filler materials (e.g. clay such as kaolin, titanium oxide, zirconia, alumina, silica, silica-alumina, bentonite etcetera), molecular sieve material (e.g. small and large pore zeolites which may be ion exchanged and/or ultra stabilized for instance zeolite Y , ZSM-5 etcetera). Said conventional catalyst components may be added prior to the shaping step. Because the anionic clay is formed in situ, the resulting body will have a homogeneous dispersion of anionic clay and catalyst components. With the method according to the invention, multiply functional bodies can be prepared which can be used as a catalyst or as a catalyst additive.<br><br>
The process according to the invention may be conducted batch-wise or in a continuous mode, optionally in a continuous multi-step operation. The process may also be conducted partly batch-wise and partly continuous.<br>
If desired, the crystalline anionic clay-containing shaped bodies prepared by the process according to the invention may be subjected to ion exchange, in which the interlayer charge-balancing anions of the clay are replaced with other anions. Said other anions are the ones commonly present in anionic clays and<br><br>
given in US 4,774,212, which is included by reference for this purpose. Said ion exchange can be conducted as soon as the crystalline anionic clay has been formed.<br>
The present invention is further directed to crystalline anionic clay-containing shaped bodies obtainable by the process according to the invention. As mentioned above, the shaped bodies appear to have high mechanical strength and attrition resistance, comparable with that of clay-containing bodies prepared by dispersing clay into a matrix or binder material and then shaping the clay- containing composition, yet without matrix or binder material having to be added to the crystalline anionic clay. The crystalline anionic clay described in this invention possesses binding properies which are not only sufficient to bind itself in 100 % anionic clay particles with good attrition resistance, but further the anionic clay possesses sufficient binding power to bind, in the same particle other non-binding catalyst components such as zeolites, alumina etcetera obtaining particles with attrition resistances comparable to regular FCC catalysts. This means that with the process according to the invention, crystalline anionic clay-containing shaped bodies can be prepared containing more than 50 wt%, preferably more than 70 wt %, or even more preferably more than 90 wt% crystalline anionic clay. Although binder material may be<br><br>
present in the shaped crystalline anionic clay containing bodies according to the invention, for instance as a result of an excess aluminium source present in the precursor mixture, any binder that is present in the shaped bodies according to the invention will be present as a discontinuous phase, as is depicted schematically in Figure 1. This is in contrast to clay-containing bodies prepared in the conventional way, i.e. by embedding clay into a matrix or binder material, where the binder material in the bodies is present in a continuous phase, as is schematically depicted in Figure 2. It is of course also possible to incorporate the crystalline anionic clay-containing shaped bodies into a matrix. In that case, composite particles are obtained which comprise crystalline anionic clay-containing shaped bodies with, optionally, binder material in a discontinuous phase, embedded in a binder material, as is schematically depicted in figure 3.<br>

EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
Catapal ® and MgO were mixed in a slurry at room temperature (Mg:AI atomic ratio 1:3). The slurry was aged for 40 hoursand subsequently spraydried. A sample of the aged slurry was examined with XRD which indicated that some hydrotalcite was formed. The resulting particles were calcined at 500°C for one hour. The calcined particles were re-slurried and aged overnight at 85 °C. XRD showed that the particles contained essentially only hydrotalcite. The amount of hydrotalcite already formed before spray drying was estimated to be approximately 10 wt% of the final amount of anionic clay formed. The particles had a good attrition index. The average particle size as measured by laser light scattering was 63 microns, the pore volume (H2O) was 0.35 ml/g, the L.O.I. was 31.5%, the average bulk density 0.688 g/l, the B.E.T. surface area 210 m2/g.<br>
Example 2<br>
Catapal ®, peptised with 0.5 wt% of formic acid, and MgO were mixed in a slurry (Mg:AI mole ratio 1:3). The mixture was homogenized in a colloid mill and allowed to age for 40 hours at ambient temperature and spray-dried. The resulting particles were calcined at 500 °C for one hour. The calcined particles were re-slurried and aged overnight at 85°C. XRD showed that hydrotalcite was present in the particles. The particles had a good attrition index. The average particle size as measured with laser light scattering was 67 microns, the L.O.i. was 32.7%, the average bulk density 0.703 g/l, the B.E.T. suri'ace area 217 m2/g.<br><br>
Example 3<br>

Subsequently, the calcined particles were suspended in water and aged for 18 hours at 65 °C. X-ray diffraction showed that hydrotalcite was present in the resulting particles.<br>
Example 4<br>
300 g of MgO and 300 g of Gibbsite were mixed in 5 liters of water at room temperature. Particles were made by spray drying. The particles were calcined at 500 °C for 18 hours. Subsequently, the calcined particles were suspended in water and aged for 18 hours at 65 °C.<br>
Example 5<br>
3 g of MgO and 3 g of Gibbsite were mixed in 50 ml water and 6 wt% ammonium vanadate and 3 wt% cerium nitrate (calculated on the reactant solids, defined as the oxides) at room temperature. Particles were made by pelletising. The particles were calcined at 500 °C for 18 hours. Subsequently, the calcined particles were suspended in water and aged for 18 hours at 65 °C.<br>
Example 6<br>
3 g of MgO and 3 g of Gibbsite were mixed in 50 ml water and 10 wt% copper nitrate (calculated on the reactant solids, defined as the oxide) at room temperature. Particles were made by pelletising. The particles were calcined at 500 °C for 18 hours. Subsequently, the calcined particles were suspended in<br><br>
water and aged for 18 hours at 65 °C. X-ray diffraction showed that hydrotalcite was present in the resulting particles.<br>
Example 7<br>
Fine ground gibbsite and magnesium oxide powder were slurried in water in quantities so that in the final mixture the molar ratio of Mg to Al (calculated as the oxides) was close to 2.3. The mixture was milled and homogenised with high shear mixing. The slurry contained about 20 wt% total solids and was pre-aged at ambient temperature overnight, A sample was taken out, filtered washed and dried at 120°C. XRD analysis of this sample indicated that some anionic clay was formed and the rest of the material was unreacted gibbsite, magnesium oxide and brucite. Subsequently the pre-aged matenai was spray dried. The formed microspheres were calcined at 500°C for 2 hours and then slurried in water and aged at 65°C for 8 hours. The product was filtered, washed, dried and subjected to XRD analysis which indicated that the product was anionic clay. The amount of anionic clay formed prior to spray-drying was estimated to be about 15 wt%. The product had good attrition resistance properties, bulk density, and surface area and comparable to a regular FCC catalyst.<br>
Example 8<br>
Example 7 was repeated except that the starting slurry was pre-aged at 60 °C overnight. XRD showed that in this stage the material contained anionic clay, unreacted gibbsite, unreacted magnesium oxide, and brucite. The pre-aged material was spray dried and calcined at 500°C for 2 hours and then slurried in water and aged at ambient temperature for 8 hours. The product was filtered, washed and dried at 120 X. XRD analysis indicated that the product was<br><br>
anionic clay. The particles were tested as above and were found to have acceptable attriton resistance properties.<br>
Example 9<br>
Example 7 was repeated except that in the slurry before pre-aging and spray drying, 8 wt% of cerium nitrate (calculated on the reactant solids, defined as the oxide) was added.
