				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a Trapped Vortex Combustor used in the field of combustion technology. More particularly, the invention relates to the design of a combustor especially suited for use in a gas turbine engine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Gas turbine engines have been widely utilized as prime movers in stationary power generation plants. However, improvements in combustion efficiency, which would be especially advantageous in order to reduce emissions, would be desirable. In various attempts to achieve such improvements, many different methods and structures have been tried, either experimentally or commercially. Some of such attempts have included the use of recirculation zones to provide a continuous ignition source by mixing hot combustion products with the incoming fuel and air mixture. Structural devices such as swirl vanes, bluff bodies, and rearward facing steps have commonly been employed to establish recirculation zones for flame stability. The challenge, however, has been in fuel introduction methodology, and the structure of a flame stabilizer that ensures performance (including acceptable emissions and acoustic stability) while reducing capital and operating costs.<br>
Flame stabilization criteria are even more important when operating at trans-sonic or supersonic inlet conditions. It would be especially desirable for<br><br>
burners operating under such conditions to have flame stabilizers that would be highly resistant to external flow field dynamics and/or perturbations.<br>
Consequently, it would be desirable to provide a combustor for z. gas turbine engine specifically including combustion chamber structure that enables the engine to maintain high combustion efficiency while reducing the emisscn of undesirable products-of combustion such as (a) nitrogen oxides, (b) panially oxidized hydrocarbons, and (c) carbon monoxide.<br>
Moreover, it is beneficial in such devices that efficient and effective "combustor cooling be achieved.   Such a design approach increases comb-.stor operating life (and thus achieves overall reduction in life cycle costs while maximizing combustion efficiency.<br>
Depending upon the specific operating needs of a particular implementation, certain subsets of (or even all) of the foregoing can be implemented using various combinations of exemplary embodiments, or variations of certain aspects of such exemplary embodiments.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
One embodiment of a novel combustor design for a gas turbine engine disclosed herein has a combustor configuration in which a flame holder is provided that extends between inner and outer combustion chamber walls. In one embodiment the inner and outer walls are each substantially cylindrical, and thus form an annular combustion chamber in which a plurality of radisfty extending flame holders are provided.<br>
One design utilizes an inlet center body in which compression is achieved at reselected inlet velocities by exploiting an oblique shock extending from a leading edge structure laterally outwardly to, at the design velocity, adjacent center body structures. In such case, the center bodies and accompanying aft bluff bodies are affixed in a reselected, substantially matched orientation, so as to smoothly and continuously acquire clean compressed inlet air, and to efficiently and reliably discharge the ‘resulting products of combustion. In one configuration, a plurality of center bodies are oriented at a helical angle within an annular combustor housing.<br>
The annular combustor housing is simplified in that a rear wall of an inlet center body serves as an upstream wall of a combustion chamber, providing flame holding. By virtue of the rear wall of the inlet center body extending outward from the inner chamber wall to the outer chamber wall, and the use of a first bluff body likewise extending outward between the inner chamber wall and the outer combustor wall, then located a distance downstream a trapped vortex combustor cavity is defined to provide for thorough mixing of fuel and air, sufficient residence time for reaction of fuel with oxidant to minimize the escape of incomplete combustion products, and general flame stability.<br>
The foregoing combustion chamber configuration is designed for efficient mixing of fuel and air, especially at supersonic inlet inflow velocities. By the utilization of a rear wall of an inlet body, a separation streamline is formed dividing the incoming cold charge with a highly energetic locked vortex pair located between the fore and aft bodies. This arrangement provides for a more<br>
compact primary zone and for Stacie flame holding that is desirable over an extended operating range.   Use of   -el and/or oxidizer injection opposite to the natural rotation sense of the trapper /ortices has found to still further enhance the mixing of fuel and air in such cz~z station chambers.   The above mentioned embodiment provides increased combustion intensity through improved fuel/air mixing, over conventional schemes    A still further feature is-provided by an embodiment incorporating side struts extending at or adjacent the rear wall of the center body, so that some primary zone hot products are more easily convected into the unreacted inlet flow for increased performance.   In another variation, multiple trapped vortex cavities are idled, by use of multiple aft bluff bodies, which may, but need not use seconds', injection to enhance performance.<br>
Further, it is to be understood rat although a combustor cavity' having roughly a segmented annular shape and having a substantially rectangular cross-section at any selected static- = ong the flow path is depicted, other designs utilizing an inlet body rear via  flame holder shape other than that just described are also possible (e.g., rectangular cross-sectional shard, or non-heptangular cross-sectional shape).   However by optimizing combustor volume, i.e., operating at desirable pressures ane temperatures to optimize heat release while ‘maintaining desirable temperature profile and emission results, the "hot section" components of an engine utilizing such trapped vortex combustors may be advantageously reduced.<br>
In another embodiment, a fuel/air ore-mixture may be supplied at high velocity via inlet fluid compression ducts adjacent to an inlet center body, so that<br>
flashback from the combustor may be reliably avoided even in the case of fuels that have a very high flame velocity. Such a high velocity inlet can also serve to acoustically decouple the upstream flow acoustics from combustion chamber acoustics.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A detailed  view of an exemplary embodiment of a trapped vortex combustor 30 for a gas turbine engine is provided in FIG. 1.   Inlet fluid, normally compressed air A as indicated by reference letter A is supplied through inlet 34 defined between inner inlet wall 36 and outer inlet wall 38.    Downstream from inlet 34, inlet fluid A is divided into three streams, namely an outer cooling air supply B, a combustion air supply C, and an inner cooling air supply D. Leading edges 40 and 42 split entering air supply A thusly.     The outer air cooling air supply B is contained within an outer plenum 44 defined between a combustor outer wall 46 and an outer plenum wall 48.   The inner cooling air supply D is contained within an inner plenum 50 defined between a combustor inner wall 52 and an inner plenum wall 54. As illustrated, each of walls 48, 46, 52, and 54 are provided  in  substantial  portion  by tubular cylindrical  sections of desirable diameter to fit other components in a gas turbine engine of desired size and power output. The location of combustor inner wall 52 and combustor outer wall 46 provide an annular combustor housing 60 within which a plurality of inlet<br>
centerbodies 62 (also called "forebodies") are placed. These centerbodies 62 extend from wall 52 to wall 46 and as shown, are offset at a helical angle alpha (a) with respect to the longitudinal axial centerline 64 of the combustor housing 60. One suitable angle alpha (a) is about 30 degrees (30°).<br>
In situations where environmental concerns are significant, in order to obtain the proper conditions for combustion while producing low-pollution products of combustion, a fuel supply system provides a pre-mixing stage in<br>
which the fuel and combustion air    are premixed prior to flow past the centerbodies 62.   In this stage, as better illustrated in FIG. 10, fuel injectors 70 add the fuel F to an inlet fluid, normally air A or other fuel free oxidant containing stream (but which may contain some high value fuel such as hydrogen, or some low value fuel, such as coal bed methane, coal mine purge gas, landfill methane, biomass produced fuel gas, sub-quality natural gas, or other low grade .fuels).  In order to carry out the actual combustion step in an operationally reliable manner, the velocity of the compressed inlet fuel air pre-mix should preferably be high at the intermixing point between the combustion chamber 72 and the delivery point of the combustible fuel/air mixture, so that flashback of the flame front from the combustion chamber 72 toward the fuel injectors 70 is reduced or avoided.   In the exemplary engine design described herein, when operated at the suitable conditions described herein, the residence time in the diffuser portion 74 is too short to initiate an auto-ignition process in the prescribed residence time. Further, the aerodynamics of the diffuser 74 design and of the inlet sections 76 and 78 are.not conducive to flame holding.<br>
In order to stabilize the combustion process downstream of the rear wall 104 of inlet centerbody 80, the velocity of gases through the combustion chamber 72 is reduced by providing a combustion chamber 72 having substantially larger cross-sectional flow area than provided by the inlet ducts 76 and 78 thereto. As seen in FIG. 10, localized recirculation zones are provided to confine trapped vortices V in order to have an adequate residence time to substantially minimize creation of carbon monoxide in the combustor 72, and a<br>
suitable length of burnout zone LBz is provided in order to bring the remaining CO in the exiting combustion gases to an environmentally acceptable low residual level.<br>
At the outset, we determined that the length of a primary .mixing zone "LPz" - in  a  combustor  can   be   shortened   considerably  by  adopting   the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8, even in the absence of trapped vortex  cavities. These figures are views taken looking inward along a combustor, such as if radially mounted in the manner first set forth in FIG. 1 above, looking down on the exemplary combustor 100 taught herein.    Combustor 100 is situated between a first wall 122 and a second wall  124, behind rear wall 126 of centerbody 128.    In one embodiment, rear wall 126 of the centerbody 128 includes provision by way of a perforated wall 130 operably communicating with cooling gas source (for example, by pressurization of the interior space 133 of centerbody 128), for impingement cooling of rear wall 126 by the use of perforations 138 in interior rear wall 140, as indicated by reference arrows 142 in FIG. 7.   Alternately, or in addition, effusion cooling is provided for rear wall 126, as indicated by cooling air flow 144 through perforations 146 in rear wall 126. The enhanced with the combination of impingement and effusion cooling on the rear wall/flameholder 126 of centerbody 128, utilizing an interior rear wall 140 with coolant passageways 138 therethrough, is useful in many configurations as indicated in other figures herein.    Although this simple, robust bluff body combustor design   allows  easy sizing for the  required  inlet velocity,  the combustion efficiency can be expected to be less than optimum since the length<br><br>
of primary zone is not as compact as it could be, and perhaps would encounter unsteady vortex shedding and reduced primary zone combustion intensity,.and thus, would not be an optimum design solution for many commercially important combustor, designs. Thus, combustion efficiency might be less than optimal. Therefore reduced combustion intensity would be expected, especially as compared to the novel trapped vortex combustors as explained below.<br>
Turning-now to FIG. 9, an exemplary combustor 200 has been developed. Combustor 200 is provided using an aft body 202 for provision of trapped vortices 204 and 206. This combustor 200 configuration has lower pressure drop through the combustor 200 relative to the simple bluff body configuration illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8. Additionally, flame stability is improved through the locking of downstream vortices 204 and 206 between the rear wall 126 of centerbody (or "forebody") 128 and the aft body 202. And, by providing for sufficient space rearward (flow-wise) of the aft body 202, the bumout zone of length LBz is provided. Thus, a compact primary zone Pz having a relatively high combustor efficiency is provided. Note that this and other designs provided herein can advantageously utilize the combination of impingement and effusion cooling methods first discussed in connection with FIGS. 7 and 8 above.<br>
In FIG. 9, the efficient combustion and high heat release per unit of combustor volume is made possible with a highly turbulent primary zone. Importantly, the jet impingement, and pumping action, as is further illustrated in FIG. 10, may increase combustor efficiency to at least 99% or more, and more preferably, to at least 99.5% or more.<br>
By comparison of FIG. 4 to FIG. 9, one of the improvements in the art can be easily noted with respect to the design illustrated in FIG. 4.     In FIG. 4. a trapped vortex combustor 300 for a gas turbine engine is provided. An air supply system provides inlet air A to the combustor 300.   A fuel supply system is provided for the supply of gaseous fuel F.   The fuel supply system has a premix stage wherein fuel F from the fuel supply system is- ejected from fuel supply structures 302 and mixed with inlet air A to provide "a lean pre-mixture 304 upstream of a first 306 of one or more trapped vortex cavities.   Here, a first trapped vortex cavity 303 is provided rearward of rear wall 306 of forebody 310. A first aft bluff body 310 with a front wall 312 is provided to define the rear or the first 303 trapped vortex cavity.    Due to the bulk flow of the premix past the forebody 308, a predetermined inward bulk fluid swirl direction in the manner indicated by reference arrows 320 and 322 is provided.    At least one pilot fuel stage is provided, using one or more pilot injectors 330 in fluid communication with the fuel supply system.   Each of the least one of the one or more pilot injectors 330 are configured to inject fuel into a first 306 of said one or more trapped vortex cavities. As indicated in FIG. 4, the pilot injectors are configured to inject fuel as indicated by reference arrows 332 and 334 into the first 306 of the one or more trapped vortex cavities in a direction oriented to provide a jet from the pilot injectors 330 to provide momentum of fuel and burning gases in opposition to the bulk fluid swirls 320 and 322 of predetermined direction. Here, two pilot injectors 330 are provided, although this number may be adjusted as necessary to provide the necessary mixedness and to achieve the combustion<br>
efficiencies desired, as well as to provide the proper quantity of supplemental fuel. For example, it has been found that providing about 95% of the necessary gaseous fuel in the bulk premix is acceptable, and in SUCH cases about 5% of the necessary gaseous fuel is then provided by the pilot fue; injector stage of the fuel supply system.<br>
FIG. 5 provides a partially broken away perspecti.e view of the exemplary trapped vortex combustor just illustrated in FIG. 4, now nore clearly showing the • use of first 340 and second 342 struts which are provided in partial airfoil shaped configuration with a rear wall 344 that is substantially cc-olanar with the rear wall 306 if forebody 308.   The struts 340 and 342 introduce yet additional vortex locations for trapping vortexes 350 and 352.  Note that t-e flow field will be three dimensional, not just in the transverse direction as indicated here for purposes of illustration and explanation.    Alternately, a cylindrical, dowel shaped strut 360 can be provided. The cylindrical strut 360 is shown spaced upstream a length SL from rear wall 306 of forebody 308, and, if desired, struts 340 and 342 can likewise be located upstream from rear wall 306.   As shown, struts, whether 340, 342, or 360, extend outward from first 362 or second 364 sidewalls of forebody 308 toward, and as configured in FIG. 5, to exterior sidewalls 370 and 372 of combustor 300.   It should be understood that the combustor shown in FIG. 4 can advantageously utilize the cooling techniques for rear wall 306 as taught above with respect to FIGS. 7, 8 and 9.<br>
Attention is again directed to FIG. 5, where combustor 300 is provided with one o'r more duct passageways 380 adjacent to the forebody 308.   Such<br>
passageways are in this configuration defined between walls 364 and 372 on one side, and walls 362 and 370 on the other side, and between floor 380 and roof 382 of the combustor on both sides. The forebody rear wall 306 defines a dump plane having a cross-sectional area defined between the floor 380 and roof 382, and sidewalls 370 and 372. The cross-sectional area of the dump plane is the sum of (i) the cross-sectional area of the forebody rear wall 306 and (i) the cross-sectional area of all of the one or more duct passageways adjacent to the forebody rear wall 306. A blockage ratio determined by dividing the cross-sectional area of the forebody rear wall 306 by the total cross-sectional area of the dump plane is in excess of 60 percent. In one embodiment, the blockage ratio is approximately 63 percent.<br>
Attention is now directed to FIG. 6, where a combustor 400 is provided with a unique trapped vortex cavity 403 with volume adjustment mechanism provided. This embodiment is shown as if taken through line 6-6 of FIG. 6, but with the addition of an adjustable aft bluff body 410. Aft bluff body 410 is provided with a substantially I-beam shape in which an upper flange 412 having a lower sealing surface 414 is provided for sealing against upper root sealing surface 416, A lower flange 422 is provided having an upper sealing surface 424 for sealing against floor lower sealing surface 426.

Adjustment is<br>
provided by action of servo motor 448 and appropriate gearing such as worm gear 450 acting on grooved teeth 452 in the upper flange 412. This configuration allows tuning of the vortex cavity 303 size for combustion efficiency.<br>
FIG, 11 illustrates the use of multiple inlet centerbodies 500 and 502 between sidewalls 506 and 508, offset at a spiral or helical angle alpha (a) with<br>
respect to the ceoterline 504 of a gas turbine or other engine. The helical angle in a gas turbine engine ean be up to about 30 degrees, or'more. As illustrated, aft bodies 510 and 512 are provided rearward of flameholding rear walls 514 and 516 of centerbodies 500 and 502, in order to provide for trapping of a vortex between the rear wall 514 and aft body 510, and between rear wall 516 and aft body 512.<br>
Jn FIG. 12, an exemplary enhanced double wall flameholding rear wall 600 with both impingement cooling passageways 602 in a first wall 603 and effusion cooling passageways 604 in a second wall 605 is provided for inlet centerbody 610. Also, pilot fuel ports 612 and 614 are provided. Additionally, an aft body 620 with pilot fuel ports 622 and 624 provide for trapped vortex operation of combustor 630.<br>
In FIG. 13, an exemplary double bluff body configuration is shown. Here both a first an bluff body 620 and a second aft bluff body 700 are illustrated. This exemplary embodiment may utilize the double wall flameholding rear wall 600 configuration as just illustrated in FIG. 12 above. However, a second bluff body 700 is provided for creating both a second recirculation zone 710, in addition to the first recirculation zone 720 as illustrated in FIG. 12 above. This configuration<br>
allows further enhancement of combustion efficiency<br>
For background and reference, FIG. 14 graphically illustrates one prior art trapped vortex combustor design which uses the basic concept of providing fuel and air injection in a manner wherein fuel and air are directed so that the injection fluid jet imparts momentum to the swirling gases in a direction which is supporting of, rather than in opposition to, the direction of swirl of .the trapped vortex. However, in the present invention, it has been discovered that improved combustion intensity and efficiency can be achieved by proving fuel and/or air injection directed so that the injection fluid imparts momentum to the swirling gases in a direction which is in opposition to, rather than supporting of, the direction of swirl of the trapped vortex.<br>
FIG. 15 shows one embodiment of a .unique trapped vortex combustor 800, wherein a simple bluff forebody (or "centerbody") 802 is provided having an interchangeable body module location 804 for the supply of an interchangeable rear wall portion 805.    The centerbody 802 has sidewalls 804 and 806 which define, together with combustor sidewalls 8,10 and 814, duct passageways 816. A first aft body 820 is provided having fuel passageways 830 and fuel injectors 832. Either a portion of burner fuel, or pilot fuel may be provided at injectors 832. Also provided in first aft body 820 are cooling air passageways 840 connected to a cooling air supply system, and cooling air injection ports 842 which deliver cooling air for film cooling of the aft bluff body 820.    A plurality of perforations 842 are in fluid communication with the cooling air supply system, so that the plurality of perforations provide effusion cooling to the walls, especially including<br>
the forward wall 821, of the first aft bluff body 820.  In the embodiment further indicated in FIG. 19, ihe perforations 842 are provided having a passageway 843 upstream of the outlet configured at a selected pitch angle (i.e. up and down with respect to the longitudinal flow axis indicated as centerline 850 in FIG. 15) and yaw angle (i.e., side to side with respect to the longitudinal flow axis indicated as centerline 850 in FIG. 15) with respect so said forward wall of'said first aft bluff body.    In one embodiment a pitch angle of the perforations is about 30 degrees upward in the upstream direction.   In such an embodiment, ft is also useful to provide the perforations in a yaw angle of about 30 degrees to one side or the other, so that a cooling film circulates around the bluff body 820, either clockwise or counterclockwise. Normally, such perforations are provided with uniform pitch and yaw angles, so as to create a uniform cooling air film that sweeps across said forward wall of said'first aft bluff body.  However, as further indicated in FIG. 18, the uniform pitch and yaw angles can be reversed on first 860 and second 862 sides (i.e., up on one side and down on the other) to create a swirling action for the film cooling.  In such cases an upward angle omega (Ω) may be provided equal to a downward pitch angle beta ((3), but preferably, the swirl direction is maintained uniformly.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 16, this embodiment similar to FIG. 15, but now shows an improved combustor 801 which utilizes the addition of side struts 870 and 872 which project laterally from the initial bluff forebody to create small recirculation zones for additional mixing of hot burning gases, to thereby improve combustion efficiency. As illustrated, such struts 870 and 872 are similar to struts<br>
340 and 342 depicted in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 17 is a partially cut away perspective view of an exemplary interchangeable aft bluff body 820, showing the location of cooling air ejection ports 842 and fuel injection ports 832. FIG. 18 is a partial cross-sectional view, taken through line 18-18 of FIG. 17, now showing the fuel 830 and air 840 passageways, as well as further-details of the cooling air outlets angled to "enhance flow of cooling" air circumferentially around the aft bluff body, as just discussed above. FIG. 19 is a partial side view of the aft bluff body 820, now showing the orientation of cooling air outlets 842, as well as several pilot fuel outlets 832.<br>
FIG. 20 depicts yet another embodiment for a combustor 803, similar to that shown in FIG. 16, including the use of side struts 870 and 872 adjacent the forebody 802, but now additionally showing the use of a second aft body 880 having a forward wall 882 to provide a secondary trapped vortex cavity 882 between wall 882 and rear wall 884 of first aft body 820, for providing a trapped vortex combustor of desired length.<br>
As previously mentioned the TVC combustion concept relies on inhibiting vortex shedding from the bluff body which would otherwise destabilize the primary zone and hence prematurely limit the system's operating envelop. Wide operating envelopes are highly desired for most combustion systems, especially for land based ones due to part power requirements. Furthermore, the intense combustion activity existing between the fore and aft bodies (see FIG. 16) should serve as a mechanism to facilitate the interaction between the cold charge and<br>
hot combustion products, thereby encouraging competitive emissions levels. For evaluation of performance, the values of the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio are normalized by the stoichiometric air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio, to obtain the equivalence ratio, 0 = (A/F) stoichiometric / (A/F) measured. With this definition, &gt;1 indicates fuel rich operation, and 
The discussion which follows details testing which was conducted on two TVC configurations: one as shown in FIG. 15, and another as shown in FIG. 16 with side struts located at the dump plane to further enhance mixing.<br>
First, with respect to the TVC depicted in FIG. 15, two tests were completed with the basic TVC and bluff body installation. Fueling was effectuated using the premixed fuel systems and TVC fuel legs. No bluff body fueling (partial premixing) or diffusion piloting were utilized. All testing centered on 5% (3.5% total air) front end air loading to the TVC and 95% front end air to the channel. Three distinct primary zone (front end) equivalence ratio (fe) points were tested (0.51, 0.55, 0.60), with variations in the TVC to main fueling fractions for the prescribed primary zone (front end) equivalence ratio (fe). The liner cooling air load was maintained at 25% (overall air flow percentage)<br><br>
throughout all JVC (FIG. 16 struts and FIG. 15 no strut configuration) tests. Attempts were made at increasing the air loading to the TVC to 10% front end air loading but were unsuccessful due to blow out and/or hardware overtemping (liner and/or IE module thermocouples). It should be noted that throughout all excursions, liner temperatures were not uniform -along the length of the combustor, ranging from 800T to 1700 F (427'C to 927'C) , depending on the location of the heat release and/or fuel loading (equivalence ratio). Full combustion pressure (275 pounds per square inch absolute or 1900 kilopascals absolute) and preheat temperatures (761T or 405'C) were attained.<br>
FIG. 23 and 24 denotes the NOx and CO emissions, respectively, versus primary zone (front end) equivalence ratio (fe) for all data acquired under this configuration, irrespective of the TVC/channel fuel splits. Note that emissions were corrected to a 15% O2 standard. The NOx emissions demonstrate the typical behavior with increasing primary zone (front end) equivalence ratio (fe) or front end flame temperature: increasing primary zone flame temperature<br>
increases NOx emissions due to the primary NOx generation mechanism.   The<br>
CO emissions, conversely, demonstrate the inverse trend which is again, typical for kinetic CO production. Apparently, the equilibrium CO production mechanism whereby CO levels begin to increase with temperature was not attained with excursions during testing. Note the use of a logarithmic scale on the y-axis is due to the rapid jump in CO levels with leaner mixtures.<br>
FIG. 25 compiles the three excursions in main equivalence ration values (051, 0.55 and 0.60) with a plot of NOx versus CO emissions.  At each channel<br>
based equivalence ratio, where cpma_ = channel fuel/channel air, the excursions in TVC based equivalence ratio, tvc = TVC fuel/TVC air, were undertaken in attempts at holding total fuel levels constant per the design table. This lead to wide excursions in TVC equivalence ratios: 0.51 - 1.5. Apparently the lower equivalence -ratio setting has a dramatic effect on the CO production in that high levels (hundreds of ppm) were produced -over the excursion. On richenmg the overall, front end equivalence ration, sizeable drops in CO were achieved as the mixture effectively "burnt out" or converted the CO to CO2.<br>
The optimal fueling split achieved was with a main equivalence ratio, main = 0.6 whereby a simultaneous NOx/CO values of 28/28 ppm corrected to 15% O2 were recorded. See FIG. 27 below which is an enlargement of the previous figure. Note that the main equivalence ratio, main = 0.51 curve, has been excluded from the data set for clarity.<br>
The final figure in the set (FIG. 26) denotes the emissions based combustion efficiency versus the Severity Parameter (SP) which was defined by<br>
Roquefort et al., in 2001, as follows:<br>
In essence, the Severity Parameter mimics a loading parameter which effectively standardizes various fuel/air scheduling studies. Clearly shown is the increase in efficiency as the loading parameter increases from 7.0 to 8.0, where-after it levels off. The increase is expected due to the intensification of turbulence and<br>
hence combustion activity within the TVC region (region between the bluff body and aft body) under the action of increasing fuel loading. More important, however, is the high levels of efficiency (&gt; 99.5%) demonstrated. This is a tribute to-the superior nature of the novel design provided herein as a whole relative to other flame stabilizer concepts such as axial and/or radial inflow premixers.<br>
With respect to the design depicted in FIG. 16, i.e., a TVC with struts, the data confirms that further augmentation of the interaction of the primary and highly energetic core flow with the cold, co-flowing channel flow is required to fully exploit the benefits of the TVC concept.    When the hot and turbulent combustion  products between the fore and aft body are distributed more effectively within the channel flow, higher combustion  intensity and  hence efficiency  results.      Furthermore,  this   heightened   interaction   reduces   CO emissions since ignition is commenced earlier within the liner, thereby allowing more time for burnout. In the test, four, 0.25 inch diameter rods were installed as struts at the dump plane, spanning equal flow areas to serve as conduits for the hot TVC combustion products into the channel flow.   A simple row of cooling holes 842 (see FIG. 21, for similar configuration) was employed along the axis of the rods to ensure reliability of the part at the combustor temperature. Table 1 details the exact data points run for this hardware configuration.  A combustion pressure  of  approximately  270   pounds  per  square   inch   absolute   (1860 kilopascals absolute) and TVC equivalence ratio (tvc) of 0.75 were maintained for all points.   After establishing these baseline conditions, excursions in front<br>
end equivalence ratio were conducted through adjustments of the channel or main equivalence ratio (main)<br>
FIG. 28 below compares the results of such a modification to the baseline TVC results shown earlier. Again, combustion efficiency is plotted versus the Severity Parameter, SP. Clearly shown is the greater breadth of near 100% combustion efficiency relative to the previous runs; the region of near perfect combustion efficiency extends to lower Severity Parameter values than before.<br>
Perhaps the greatest proof of this configuration's performance gains can be demonstrated by a plot of CO versus NOx (corrected to 15% O2) were achieved over a sizeable stoichiometric range, far superior to all prior configurations (TVC or bluff body). Furthermore, the 10 ppm NOx/10ppm CO threshold was even achieved and exceeded. The curve demonstrates both CO generation mechanisms: equilibrium production for richer mixtures and kinetic production for the leaner mixtures. The importance of encouraging the interaction between the cold and hot charge has been clearly demonstrated.<br>
Combustion testing on three hardware configurations has been completed. Testing commenced on .the simplest flame stabilizer (bluff body, i.e. FIG. 7) with a 63% blockage ratio with expected levels of success. Combustion efficiencies above 99% were routinely achieved but competitive combustion exhaust gas emissions were not. The second test series evaluated the TVC concept which relies on locking a vortex pair between a fore and aft body (i.e., FIG. 15). This configuration resulted in dropping emissions levels from the hundreds (characteristic of the bluff body configuration) to the 20-30 ppm range,<br>
with resulting gains is overall combustion efficiency (&gt; 99%). Knowledge that promoting the interaction between the highly turbulent TVC and channel flow is favorable for efficiency gains, lead to the evaluation of a third concept which utilized strgts within the channehtself 'FIGS. 4, 5 and 16). For testing purposes, rods were used as struts, as noted h FIG. 4. These sheltered conduits were<br>
shown to be  effective' in increasing ire interaction of the incoming coid premix stream and" the hot circulating burning gases. The 'resulting emissions levels (below 10 ppm NOX/CO and high combustion efficiencies (&gt; 99.9%) have proven the success of this configuration for possible implementation into an industrial gas turbine system.<br>
