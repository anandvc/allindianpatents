Composition and method for improving plant health<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to plant-protecting active ingredient mixtures having syn-<br>
ergistically enhanced action and to a method of improving the health of plants by apply-<br>
ing said mixtures to the plants or the locus thereof.<br>
One typical problem arising in the field of pest control lies in the need to reduce the<br>
dosage rates of the active ingredient in order to reduce or avoid unfavorable<br>
environmental or toxicological effects whilst still allowing effective pest and pathogen<br>
control.<br>
Another problem encountered concerns the need to have available pest control agents<br>
which are effective against a broad spectrum of pests and pathogens.<br>
Another problem underlying the present invention is the desire for compositions that<br>
improve plants, a process which is commonly and hereinafter referred to as "plant<br>
health". For example, advantageous properties that may be mentioned are improved<br>
crop characteristics including: emergence, crop yields, protein content, more developed<br>
root system (improved root growth), tillering increase, increase in plant height, bigger<br>
leaf blade, less dead basal leaves, stronger tillers, greener leaf color, pigment content,<br>
photosynthetic activity, less fertilizers needed, less seeds needed, more productive<br>
tillers, earlier flowering, early grain maturity, less plant verse (lodging), increased shoot<br>
growth, enhanced plant vigor, increased plant stand and early germination; or any<br>
other advantages familiar to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Another difficulty in relation to the use of pesticides is that the repeated and exclusive<br>
application of an individual pesticidal compound leads in many cases to a rapid selec-<br>
tion of pests or pathogens that have developed natural or adapted resistance against<br>
the active compound in question.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide pesticidal mixtures which<br>
solve the problems outlined above.<br>
The combating of harmful phytopathogenic fungi is not the only problem the farmer has<br>
to face. Also harmful insects and other pestscan cause a great damage to crops and<br>
other plants. An efficient combination of fungicidal and insecticidal activity is desirable<br>
to overcome this problem. Thus, it is a further object of the present invention to provide<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
2<br>
a mixture that, on the one hand, has good fungicidal activity, and, on the other hand,<br>
good insecticidal activity, resulting in a broader pesticidal spectrum of action.<br>
We have found that this object is in part or in whole achieved by the combination of<br>
active compounds defined at the outset.<br>
Especially, it has been found that a mixture of a neonicotinoid, preferably acetamiprid,<br>
clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid or thiamethoxam, more<br>
preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid or thiamethoxam most preferably<br>
thiamethoxam and one or two fungicides selected from pyraclostrobin and boscalid<br>
achieves and mixtures comprising boscalid and metalaxyl show markedly enhanced<br>
action against plant pathogens compared to the control rates that are possible with the<br>
individual compounds and/or is suitable for improving the health of plants when applied<br>
to plants, parts of plants, seeds, or at their locus of growth.<br>
Mixtures of thiamethoxam with certain strobilurine fungicides are known from<br>
WO99/48366. However, all of the strobilurines mentioned in that document are acetic<br>
acid derivatives, whereas pyraclostrobin of the present invention is a methyl car-<br>
bamate.<br>
WO02/102148 discloses mixtures of fludioxonil, metalaxyl and a strobilurine fungicide<br>
which optionally may further contain an insecticide, inter alia thiamethoxam. The stro-<br>
biiurine fungicides disclosed all are acetic acid derivatives.<br>
In WO 00/28825, at least quaternary compositions are described that comprise an in-<br>
secticide such as thiamethoxam and three fungicides selected from acylalanines, for<br>
example metaiaxyi, phenyipyrroies, for example fiudioxonil, and triazoles, for example<br>
difenoconazole. Preferred is a composition comprising thiamethoxam, mefenoxam,<br>
fiudioxonil and difenoconazole.<br>
None of this documents mentions mixtures of thiamethoxam with pyraclostrobin or<br>
boscalid or mixtures comprising boscalid and metalaxyl.<br>

tures comprising thiamethoxam, pyraclostrobin, boscalid and metalaxyl.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises mixtures comprising<br>
boscalid and metalaxyl<br>
All embodiments of the above-mentioned mixtures are herein below also referred to as<br>
"inventive mixtures" or "mixtures according to the invention".<br>
The inventive mixtures are suitable for foliar application in living crops of plants as well<br>
as, in particular, for dressing applications on plant propagation material. The latter term<br>
embraces seeds of all kinds (fruit, tubers, grains), cuttings, cut shoots and the like. One<br>
particular field of application is the treatment of all kinds of seeds.<br>
In addition to the mixtures, this invention also relates to a method of controlling fungi<br>
and/or improving the health of plants, which comprises treating a site, for example a<br>
plant or a plant propagation material, that is infested or liable to be infested by fungi<br>
with a) a neonicotinoid, preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid,<br>
nitenpyram, thiacloprid or thiamethoxam, more preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin,<br>
imidacloprid or thiamethoxam most preferably thiamethoxam, with b) pyraclostrobin,<br>
and/or with c) boscalid, in any desired sequence or simultaneously, that is, jointly or<br>
separately.<br>
In addition, the invention furthermore relates to a method of controlling fungi and/or<br>
improving the health of plants, which comprises treating a site, for example a plant or a<br>
plant propagation material, that is infested or liable to be infested by fungi with a)<br>
boscalid and b) metalaxyl, in any desired sequence or simultaneously, that is, jointly or<br>
separately.<br>
Generally, the invention furthermore relates to a method of controlling fungi and/or im-<br>
proving the health of plants, which comprises treating a site, for example a plant or a<br>
plant propagation material, that is infested or liable to be infested by fungi with the pes-<br>
ticides present in a inventive mixture in any desired sequence or simultaneously, that<br>
is, jointly or separately.<br>
Advantageous mixing ratios by weight of the active ingredients are neonicotinoid, pref-<br>
erably acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid or<br>
thiamethoxam, more preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid or thiamethoxam<br>
most preferablythiamethoxam : pyraclostrobin or: boscalid from 100:1 to 1:100. A pre-<br>
ferred ratio for neonicotinoid, preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imida-<br>
cloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid or thiamethoxam, more preferably acetamiprid,<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
7<br>
clothianidin, imidacloprid or thiamethoxam most preferably thiamethoxam:boscalid is<br>
10:1 to 1:10. For example, for seed treatment, ratios of 3 kg: 30 g a.i./100 kg, 100 g : 1<br>
g a.i./100 kg, 30 g : 3 kg a.i./100 kg or 1 g: 100g a.i./100 kg of seed are suitable. For<br>
some specific crop seeds, such as lettuce or onions, the rates can be higher.<br>
Furthermore, advantageous mixing ratios by weight of three active ingredients are<br>
thiamethoxam : pyraclostrobin : boscalid in which each combination of two ingredients<br>
in the mixture of three ingredients ranges from 100:1 to 1:100.. The amount of any one<br>
of the ingredients in the mixture may range from 1 g to 3 kg a.i./100 kg of seed. For<br>
example, ratios of 50 g: 5 g: 20 g a.i./100 kg is suitable.<br>
Advantageously, the pesticidal mixtures may comprise metalaxyl in which each combi-<br>
nation of two ingredients in the mixture of two to four ingredients ranges from 100:1 to<br>
1:100. .<br>
Advantageous mixing ratios by weight of the active ingredients are metalaxyl: boscalid<br>
from 100:1 to 1:100 by weight.<br>
The novel active ingredient mixtures have very advantageous curative, preventive and<br>
systemic fungicidal properties for protecting cultivated plants. As has been mentioned,<br>
said active ingredient mixtures can be used to inhibit or destroy the pathogens that<br>
occur on plants or parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) of dif-<br>
ferent crops or useful plants, while at the same time those parts of plants which grow<br>
iater are also protected from attack by such pathogens. Active ingredient mixtures have<br>
the special advantage of being highly active against diseases in the soil that mostly<br>
occur in the early stages of plant development.<br>
Specifically, they are suitable for controlling the following harmful fungi:<br>
•	Alternaria species on vegetables and fruit,<br>
•	Bipolaris and Drechslera species on cereals, rice and turf,<br>
•	Blumeria graminis (powdery mildew) on cereals,<br>
•	Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) on strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and<br>
grapevines,<br>
•	Didymella species on various plants,<br>
•	Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea on cucurbits,<br>
•	Fusarium and Verticillium species on various plants,<br>
•	Mycosphaerella species on cereals, bananas and peanuts,<br>
•	Phakopsara pachyrhizi and Phakopsara meibomiae on soybeans<br>
•	Phytophthora species on various plants,<br>
•	Plasmopara viticola on grapevines,<br>
•	Podosphaera leucotricha on apples,<br><br>
PF 56359<br>

•	Pseudocercosporella herpothchoides on wheat and barley,<br>
•	Pseudoperonospora species on hops and cucumbers,<br>
•	Puccinia species on cereals,<br>
•	Pyricularia oryzae on rice,<br>
•	Pythium species on various plants,<br>
•	Rhizoctonia species on cotton, legumes, rice and turf,<br>
•	Sclerotinia species on various plants,<br>
•	Septoria tritici and Stagonospora nodorum on wheat,<br>
•	Thielaviopsis species on various plants,<br>
•	Uncinula necator on grapevines,<br>
•	Ustilago species on cereals and sugar cane, and<br>
•	Venturia species (scab) on apples and pears.<br>

In particular, the inventive mixtures are suitable for combating pests of the orders Col-<br>
eoptera, Lepidoptera, Thysanoptera, Homoptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera.<br>
They are also suitable for controlling the following plant parasitic nematodes such as<br>
Meloidogyne, Globodera,Heterodera, Radopholus, Rotylenchulus, Pratylenchus and<br>
other genera.<br>
Suitable targets for seed treatment are various crop seeds, fruit species, vegetables,<br>
spices and ornamental seed, for example corn/maize (sweet and field), durum wheat,<br>
soybean, wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale, bananas, rice, cotton, sunflower, potatoes,<br>
pasture, alfalfa, grasses, turf, sorghum, rapeseed, Brassica spp., sugar beet, egg-<br>
plants, tomato, lettuce, iceberg lettuce, pepper, cucumber, squash, melon, bean, dry-<br>
beans, peas, leek, garlic, onion, cabbage, carrot, tuber such as sugar cane, tobacco,<br>
coffee, turf and forage, cruciferous, cucurbits, grapevines, pepper, fodder beet, oil seed<br>
rape, pansy, impatiens, petunia and geranium.<br>
The term seed treatment comprises all suitable seed treatment techniques known in<br>
the art, such as, but not limited to, seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed<br>
soaking, seed film coating, seed multilayer coating, seed encrusting, seed dripping,<br>
and seed pelleting.<br>
The active ingredient mixtures according to the invention are especially advantageous<br>
for seed treatment of oil seed rape, wheat, corn, rye, barley, oats, sorghum, sunflow-<br>
ers, rice, maize, turf and forage, sugar beet, beans, peas, soybeans, ornamentals, and<br>
vegetables such as cucurbits, tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes, pepper, lettuce, cabbage,<br>
carrots, cruciferous.<br>
Especially preferred is the seed treatment of oil seed rape, wheat, beans, corn, soy-<br>
beans, sugar beet, rice, vegetables, and ornamentals.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are most preferably used for the seed treat-<br>
ment of oil seed rape.<br>
In addition, mixtures according to the invention may also be used in crops which toler-<br>
ate the action of herbicides or fungicides or insecticides owing to breeding, including<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
12<br>
genetic engineering methods.<br>
For example, mixtures according to the invention can be employed in transgenic crops<br>
which are resistant to herbicides from the group consisting of the sulfonylureas, imida-<br>
zolinones, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous<br>
active substances (see for example, EP-A-0242236, EP-A-242246) (WO 92/00377)<br>
(EP-A-0257993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659) or in transgenic crop plants, for example cot-<br>
ton, with the capability of producing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which make<br>
the plants resistant to certain pests (EP-A-0142924, EP-A-0193259),<br>
Furthermore, mixtures according to the invention can be used also for the treatment of<br>
plants which have modified characteristics in comparison with existing plants consist,<br>
which can be generated for example by traditional breeding methods and/or the gen-<br>
eration of mutants, or by recombinant procedures). For example, a number of cases<br>
have been described of recombinant modifications of crop plants for the purpose of<br>
modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (e.g. WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO<br>
91/19806) or of transgenic crop plants having a modified fatty acid composition (WO<br>
91/13972).<br>
In addition, the synergistically enhanced action of the mixtures manifests itself, for ex-<br>
ample, in lower rates of application and/orin a longer duration of action and/or higher<br>
crop yields. Such enhancements were not to be expected from the sum of the actions<br>
of the individual components.<br>
It has been found that the action of the inventive mixtures, e.g. of the mixture of a<br>
neonicotinoid, preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacioprid, niten-<br>
pyram, thiacloprid or thiamethoxam, more preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, imida-<br>
cioprid or thiamethoxam most preferably thiamethoxam with pyraclostrobin and / or<br>
boscalid goes far beyond the fungicidal action of the fungicide(s) present in the mixture<br>
alone. It has been shown that the mixtures exhibit plant health effects (as outlined<br>
above) in the frame of the present invention. The term plant health comprises various<br>
sorts of improvements of plants that are not connected to the control of pests with the<br>
said mixture of a neonicotinoid, preferably acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imida-<br>
cioprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid or thiamethoxam, more preferably acetamiprid,<br>
clothianidin, imidacioprid or thiamethoxam most preferably thiamethoxam with pyra-<br>
clostrobin and/or boscaiid.<br>
The active ingredient mixtures can be used in the form of premix formulations or the<br>
active ingredients can be applied to the area, plant or seed to be treated simultane-<br>
ously or in immediate succession, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
13<br>
or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technol-<br>
ogy.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by extending the active<br>
compound with auxiliaries suitable for the formulation of agrochemicals, such as sol-<br>
vents and/or carriers, if desiredsurfactants (e.g. surfactants, adjuvans<br>
and/ordispersants), preservatives, antifoaming agents, anti-freezing agents, for seed<br>
treatment formulation also optionally colorants and/or binders and/or gelling agents,<br>

PF 56359<br>
15<br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous<br>

In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active compounds. The active compounds are employed in a<br>
purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are examples of formulations: 1. Products for dilution with water for foliar<br>
application / for seed treatment purposes, these products can be applied diluted or<br>
undiluted.<br>
A)	Soluble concentrates (SL, LS)<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in water or in a water-soluble<br>
solvent. As an alternative, wetters or other auxiliaries are added. The active compound<br>
dissolves upon dilution with water.<br>
B)	Dispersible concentrates (DC)<br>
20 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in cyclohexanone with<br>
addition of a dispersant, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone. Dilution with water gives a<br>
dispersion.<br>
C)	Emulsifiable concentrates (EC)<br>
15 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in xylene with addition of<br>
calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5% strength).<br>
Dilution with water gives an emulsion.<br>
D)	Emulsions (EW, EO, ES)<br>
40 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in xylene with addition of<br>
calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5% strength).<br>
This mixture is introduced into water by means of an emulsifier (Ultraturax) and made<br>
into a homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an emulsion.<br>
E)	Suspensions (SC, OD, FS)<br>
In an agitated ball mill, 20 parts by weight of the active compounds are comminuted<br>
with addition of dispersant, wetters and water or an organic solvent to give a fine active<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
16<br>
compound suspension. Dilution with water gives a stable suspension of the active<br>
compound.<br>
F)	Water-dispersible granules and water-soluble granules (WG, SG)<br>
50 parts by weight of the active compounds are ground finely with addition of<br>
dispersants and wetters and made into water-dispersible or water-soluble granules by<br>
means of technical appliances (for example extrusion, spray tower, fluidized bed).<br>
Dilution with water gives a stable dispersion or solution of the active compound.<br>
G)	Water-dispersible powders and water-soluble powders (WP, SP, WS)<br>
75 parts by weight of the active compounds are ground in a rotor-stator mill with<br>
addition of dispersant, wetters and silica gel. Dilution with water gives a stable<br>
dispersion or solution with the active compound.<br>
2. Products to be applied undiluted forfoliar application. For seed treatment purposes,<br>
these products can be applied diluted or undiluted.<br>
H) Dustable powders (DP, DS)<br>
 5 parts by weight of the active compounds are ground finely and mixed intimately with<br>
95% of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable product.<br>
I) Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of the active compounds is ground finely and associated with 95.5%<br>
carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-drying or the fluidized bed. This gives<br>
granules to be applied undiluted.<br>
J) ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in an organic solvent, for<br>
example xylene. This gives a product to be applied undiluted.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable<br>
products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended<br>
purposes; it is intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the<br>
active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
17<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance,<br>
wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such<br>
concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 1%.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or<br>
bactericides may be added to the active compounds, if appropriate just immediately<br>
prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the agents according to the<br>
invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The agrochemical compositions usually comprise 0.1 to 99%, preferably 0.1 to 95%, of<br>
active ingredients, 99.9 to 1%, preferably 99.9 to 5%, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and 0<br>
to 25%, preferably 0.1 to 25%, of a surfactant.<br>
Depending on the desired effect, the application rates of the mixtures according to the<br>
invention are from 0.1g/ha to 2000 g/ha, preferably from 50 to 1500 g/ha, in particular<br>
from 50 to 750 g/ha.<br>
In the treatment of seed, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.1 g to<br>
5 kg per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 g to 2.5 kg per 100 kg of seed, in particular<br>
from 1 g to 1 kg per 100 kg of seed.<br>
In the control of pests, the separate or joint application of the inventive mixtures or<br>
compositions comprising them is carried out by spraying or dusting or otherwise apply-<br>
ing the mixture to the seeds, the seedlings, the plants or the soils before or after sow-<br>
ing of the plants or before or after emergence of the plants.<br>
Conventional seed treatment formulations include for example flowable concentrates<br>
FS, solutions LS, powders for dry treatment DS, water dispersible powders for slurry<br>
treatment WS, water-soluble powders SS and emulsion ES and EC, wherein FS and<br>
WS are the most preferred ones.<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
18<br>
In accordance with one variant, a further subject of the invention is a method of treating<br>
soil by the application, in particular into the seed drill: either of a granular formulation<br>
containing the two active ingredients in combination or as a composition, or of a mix-<br>
ture of two granular formulations, each containing one of the two active ingredients,<br>
with optionally one or more solid or liquid, agriculturally acceptable carriers and/or op-<br>
tionally with one or more agriculturally acceptable surfactants. This method is advanta-<br>
geously employed in seedbeds of cereal, maize, cotton and sunflower.<br>
The invention also relates to the propagation products of plants, and especially the<br>
seed comprising, that is treated with a mixture as defined above or a composition con-<br>
taining the inventive mixture or a mixture of compositions each providing one of the<br>
active ingredients.<br>
The seed comprises the inventive mixtures in an amount of from 0.1 g to 5 kg per 100<br>
kg of seed.<br>
The synergistic pesticidal action of the inventive mixtures can be demonstrated by the<br>
experiments below:<br>
Treatments<br>
Each mixture partner is evaluated separately at the same rates as used in the mixtures.<br>
Synergism is determined by comparing the expected biological effect on plant health or<br>
on disease control from the mixture based on the individual effects from the separate<br>
partners to the biological effect seen with the mixture. Abbott's formula can be used to<br>
make this comparison.<br>
Seed Treatment - Cotton<br>
Compounds are used as technical materials and formulated in 15 % acetone in 0.05%<br>
aqueous Tween 20® (Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaureate). Fifty cotton seeds are<br>
placed in a 120 ml glass vial and 300 l of the compound preparation are pipetted onto<br>
the side of the vial just above the seeds. The vial can shaken for 3 minutes and the<br>
treated seeds were placed on aluminum foil to dry.<br>
Plant Health<br>
24 cotton seeds of each treatment are planted, 2 seeds per 7.5 cm square plastic pot<br>
containing Metro Mix 360 planting material and maintained in the greenhouse. Meas-<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
19<br>
urements taken of plant health are time to emergence, percent emergence, shoot bio-<br>
mass and root biomass at the 2-true-leaf stage.<br>
Synergistic Plant Disease Control<br>
To determine treatment effects on plant disease control, 12 cotton seeds of each<br>
treatment are planted, 2 seeds per 7.5 cm square plastic pot containing sandy soil and<br>
challenged with fungal pathogens. Two fungal pathogens can be used: Pythium sp.<br>
and Rhizoctonia sp. Plants are maintained in the greenhouse with bottom watering.<br>
Measurements of the severity of damping off and root rot are taken and then per cent<br>
disease control is calculated for each treatment based on the untreated controls.<br>
The test results will show that the mixtures according to the invention show a consider-<br>
able enhanced activity demonstrating synergism compared to the calculated sum of the<br>

The synergistic plant health effects of the inventive mixtures has been demonstrated by<br>
the experiments described below:<br>
To determine seed treatment effects of the inventive mixtures on plant health soft red<br>
winter wheat seeds (Variety Coker 9663) were treated with mixtures and with each mix-<br>
ture partner separately. Compounds were applied in water if formulated or in 25% ace-<br>
tone if technical material. For mixtures, water was used as the carrier unless one or<br>
more partners was used as technical material then 25% acetone was used as the car-<br>
rier. Each treatment was prepared in a 20 ml glass vial. Then 25 seeds were added,<br>
and the vial was vortexed for one minute. After treatment, seeds were allowed to dry.<br>
Plant growth pouches (18 cm x 16.5 cm cyg™ Germination Pouches, Mega-<br>
International) were watered with 17-20 ml water, and 4 seeds were placed in each<br>
growth pouch on the same day as treatment. Replication was 4x to 5x. Growth<br>
pouches were incubated at 25 C with 14 hours light and watered as needed. Germina-<br>
tion was evaluated at 3-4 and 7-8 days after treatment (DAT). Root length and wet<br>
weight mass and shoot length and wet weight mass were evaluated 7-8 DAT.<br>
Expected responses from the mixture were calculated based on the responses ob-<br>
served when each mixture partner was applied alone.<br><br>
PF 56359<br>
20<br>
Percent effects for each of the mixture partners (MP1 and MP2) applied solo were cal-<br>
culated as follows:<br>
MP1 = (Control response - MP1 response)/Control response * 100%<br>
MP2 = (Control response - MP2 response)/Control response * 100%<br>
The appropriate control response was used for each mixture partner.<br>
Then, the expected % response for the mixture was calculated using Abbott's formula<br>
as follows:<br>
E%response = (MP1 + MP2) - (MP1 * MP2) /100<br>
Finally, the expected response for the mixture was calculated by applying the expected<br>
% response to the appropriate control for the mixture, which is the solvent blank con-<br>
trol, as follows:<br>
Expected response = Control response - (Control response * E%response/100)<br>
Experiment 1<br>
For each of the four measures of wheat plant health (root length, root mass, shoot<br>
length, and shoot mass), the actual response observed for the thiamethoxam plus<br>
boscalid mixture (50 g ai + 20 g ai respectively per 100 kg seed) was greater than the<br>
expected response based on the responses observed when each partner was applied<br>
alone demonstrating a synergistic effect on plant health. (Table 1).<br>
Percent germination of the wheat seeds for all treatments was 100%.<br>

Experiment 2<br>
For three of the four measures of wheat plant health (root mass, shoot length, shoot<br>
mass), the actual response observed for the thiamethoxam and metalaxyl mixture (50 g<br>
ai + 20 g ai respectively per 100 kg seed) was greater than the expected response<br>
based on the responses observed when each partner was applied alone (Table 2).<br>
Percent germination of the wheat seeds for all treatments was 100%.<br>
Evaluations were conducted on 16 seedlings per treatment, 4 reps with 4 seedlings<br>
