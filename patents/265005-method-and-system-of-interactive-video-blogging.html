				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to the field of multimedia applications. The present invention involves to the use of Mobile phone with camera facility: Both Feature Phone (Mobile Phone) and Smart phone etc., handheld devices with camera, desktop application, network connectivity etc, and Desktop devices, PC. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of Interactive Video Blogging.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED PRIOR ART<br>
Patent publication number (W0/2004/102855) , titled "Content Publishing Over Mobile Networks" explains a system for using mobile phones for the purpose of generating instant and permanent publishing of text, images and audio files as so-called "mBlogs" over mobile networks. The system allows the user to generate and publish text, attach image files and audio files with time and location of the event as a non-revocable and integral part of the published content. Users are allowed to view and interact with the published content with mobile phones over mobile networks. The system allows for sorting of content by category and by indexing the material by the operator of a mobile network and allows the users of mBlogs to search for content by category as well as by the<br>
X. means of indexing. Furthermore the system allows users to subscribe to mBlogs as multimedia messages for viewing on mobile phones over mobile networks.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
•	The current approach allows user to create blog from mobile/PC with still images &amp; text. Also other users can participate in blogging by adding text comments or still images. The blogging does not allow adding information in the form of audio-video as a blog or adding audio video comment or combination of text, audio, video comment from mobile/PC.<br>
•	The current approach of video blogging is inefficient &amp; does not allow user to express his views in interactive way as it lack methods to co- relate user comment &amp; original content.<br>
•	Entering text as a comment is difficult &amp; cumbersome particularly if user is using handheld device like Mobile phone. It consumes lot of user time. It is difficult to associate text comment with specific portion of video blog. Allowing user to insert comment in the form of audio video adds more value &amp; meaning which is not possible with the current approach. <br>
•	The information or comments added by other users in video blog is just one after another &amp; there is no mechanism currently available to co- relate user comments &amp; specific portion of the original video blog. User may wish to add his audio, video or text comment with respect to specific point in original video while watching. But currently there is no method available that allows user to create audio, video or text comment with respect to a specific portion of the video or inserting comment at specific time while watching.<br>
•	Original blog &amp; comments added by other participants are inseparable. All comments are put just one after another &amp; every comment or information added by any user becomes integral part of the blog due to which the blog grows in size depending on the number of users participated &amp; the information added by each user.<br>
•	User has no provision to see the comments added by various users with respect to specific portion or instant of the original blog. He cannot see the added comments interleaved with original blog with respect to time and content, keeping the original blog and comments as separate entities.<br>
•	User needs to download/stream complete blog having original content &amp; comments added by all users every time whenever he wants to watch or participate.<br>
•	As video blog size grows depending on the number of users participated &amp; the content added by them, user who participate late feels a burden of uploading &amp; downloading/streaming video blog. It overloads the server, network &amp; consumes user time &amp; money.<br>
•	User has no choice of selecting specific comments of his interest made on his favorite video blog. He needs to download/stream &amp; watch complete blog in order to see who has commented on the blog. He needs to download/stream &amp; watch complete blog in order to see just one comment added by his friend.<br>
•	User has no choice to select particular comments &amp; watch/play directly.<br>
•	Currently there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to insert comment (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog &amp; upload only the comment. He needs to upload original blog, all previous comments &amp; new comment inserted by him.<br>
•	Currently there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to insert comments (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog instantaneously &amp; upload only comments associated with specific <br>
portion, specific instant of the original video blog.<br>
•	Currently there is no mechanism or method available, which allows user to see original blog &amp; comments (text, audio, audio-video) inserted till now by various user separately (each comment is a separate entity).<br>
•	Currently there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to see original blog &amp; all comments (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog separately associated with specific portion, specific instant of the original video blog.<br>
•	Currently there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to see original blog &amp; all comments (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog, comment to comment (comment of one user associated with another user's comment) separately associated with specific portion, specific instant of the original video blog or comment of original video blog.<br>
•	Currently there is no method which allows user to see original blog, each comment (text, audio, audio-video) added by other users as a separate entity &amp; therefore cannot download/stream original blog along with comments of his choice.<br>
•	User may wish to insert comment (text, audio, audio-video) at a specific time while watching original blog &amp; may want other users to see his inserted comment played at right/same time while watching video blog. The insertion of comment while watching blog by one user &amp; play-out of original blog along with inserted comment at right time is not supported by current approach.<br>
•	User may wish to insert multiple comments in various forms (text, audio, audio-video) at different point of time while watching original blog &amp; may want other users to see his inserted comments played at right/same time while watching video blog. The insertion of comment in various forms while watching blog by one user at various point of time &amp; play-out of original blog along with inserted comments at right time is not supported by current approach.<br>
•	User may have a video blog along with comments made by various users in various forms like text, audio, video. User has no choice of selecting comments category wise like text, audio, audio-video etc.<br>
•	User has no mechanism to play the comments added by his choice of friends. User has no mechanism to randomly select the comments he wishes to see. <br>
•	User may have a video blog along with comments made by various users in various forms like text, audio, video. User cannot select a particular comment &amp; play/watch directly the comment etc<br>
•	User may have a video blog along with comments made by various users in various forms like text, audio, video. User can not select a particular comment &amp; play/watch directly the comment along with associated video or specific portion of the video etc<br>
The present invention has been designed to address these needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for Video Blogging application that enhances the blogging from just image and text to audio-video and text content along with "Interactive blogging"<br>
The present invention relates to a method which helps users to create and participate in Video Blogging by inserting comments in the form of text, audio &amp; audio-video instantaneously at suitable location while watching original blog in Real Time without modifying it. The comments inserted by user become a separate descriptor file &amp; user needs to upload only descriptor file &amp; not the video<br>
&amp; blog. Every comment uploaded by any user is stored as a separate descriptor file at the server. If there are multiple comments available on one blog then user can select specific comments as per his wish for downloading &amp; watching.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method wherein user can watch original blog along with the comments inserted by other users at various locations i.e comments inserted with respect to the content / time of insertion. The blog along with the comments can be viewed online or can be downloaded/streamed &amp; viewed. The user can add or see comments interleaved with respect to the content / time of insertion, or with traditional back to back addition.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method of interactive blogging comprising the steps of:<br>
creating and inserting comments in the form of text, audio &amp; audio-video at various location in real time without modifying the blog;<br>
uploading and storing comments as descriptor file at a server; and<br>
acquiring and playing original blog by a user along with the comments inserted by other users at various locations; where if there are multiple comments available on one blog, the user select specific comments accordingly. <br>
The present invention further relates to a method wherein original blog &amp; comments inserted by various users with respect to the content / time of insertion are separate entities therefore user has lot of flexibility in uploading, selecting comments, downloading/streaming, sorting &amp; viewing as per his convenience/wish.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention is a new use case/method for Video Blogging application that enhances the blogging from just image and text to audio-video and text content along with "Interactive AV blogging". User can create a video blog using a device having camera &amp; recording facility. He can also use existing or pre¬recorded file as a video blog.<br>
User can upload video blog to server or video blogging site using conventional/ traditional methods like as an e-mail attachment, ftp or the method recommended <br>
^ by service provider or video blog site. The method suggested here assumes that some means are available to the user to upload video blog to server, video blog site using the device available with the user like mobile phone, feature phone, smart phone, PC or any handheld device. Once uploaded, accessing the same video blog by the owner or other users depends on the terms &amp; conditions offered by host server/video blog site or service provider. The method suggested here assumes that there are some means available to access the uploaded video blog either by owner, some users or group of people which are allowed by owner (limited access) or video blog sites or service provider or can be accessed by anybody (global access). Owner of the video blog may share his blog to some people by entering their (other users) mobile numbers or user ids &amp; may invite them to watch &amp; participate in the video blog. The invited people might get some notification of the invitation through e-mail, sms or mms. If video blog is shared for all, then notification is not necessary &amp; anybody can access uploaded video. People having access can watch the video blog online using web player. If any user wants to add his comment on video blog he needs to download the blog or should have a streaming client (player that can play data streamed by server). The method suggested here assumes that some means are available to the user to download/stream video blog from server, video blog site using the device available with the user like mobile phone, feature phone, smart phone, PC or any handheld device.<br>
With the existing methods user can add only text comments. But with the help of<br>
^r new invention (l-VB) proposed here, user can insert his comment in the form of text, audio or audio video at any point of time while playing video blog. User selects the video blog of his choice downloaded by him or selects video blog to be streamed from server &amp; starts playing the video file.<br>
The application shows two windows on LCD one playing video blog (W1) &amp; another is empty (W2). Whenever he wants to insert the comment in the video blog he should select "Insert" option. Whenever he selects insert option, application pauses playback of video blog playing in one window (W1). User needs to select type of comment like text, audio or Audio-video. If user selects "text" option then other window (W2) shows text editor &amp; allows user to input text character to add text comment. If user selects "Audio" option then application allows user to record his comment as audio clip. If user selects "Audio-Video" option then other window (W2) shows camera preview &amp; user can record audio- video comment. User can resume playback of video blog from the same position in window W1 by using option "resume" after recording his comment. User can repeat above procedure of "insert" &amp; "resume" while watching video blog to insert his comments in the form of text, audio or audio -video at various points of time.<br>
The inserted comment does not affect original video blog. The inserted comment becomes a separate descriptor file. Depending on the option selected by the user each insertion becomes a separate descriptor file or all insertions during a session can be merged into one descriptor file. <br>
The descriptor file has two major parts i.e. data &amp; metadata. The purpose of metadata in descriptor file is to allow user to define the type of comment (text, audio or audio-video) &amp; remember/record the information like for which file (downloaded/streamed video blog or for a comment on video blog) it is inserted, details of the video blog like date/time, at which point of time the comment is inserted while playing, video frame number, audio frame number of the video blog, time of insertion &amp; offset. This information helps to co-relate or associate the descriptor file with the correct video blog or comment on video blog &amp; provides the information about where exactly the comment is inserted. Along with the above information it stores the data (text, audio, video) inserted by the user in compressed /encoded form.<br>
The above information helps application to find relation between the descriptor file &amp; its associated video blog. It also gives perfect information of when a particular comment in descriptor file is inserted &amp; type of comment. Using the above information it is possible to play original video blog along with the comments inserted at various point of time at correct time if original blog &amp; descriptor file is available.<br>
In descriptor file the text information is stored in ASCII form whereas audio, video information is stored in the format as used in original video blog. For example if original blog is recorded in H.263 Video &amp; AAC format then inserted AV comment<br>
^ is also stored in H.263 &amp; AAC format. In order to support this functionality application in the beginning checks the codec type of video blog &amp; initializes the same for inserting audio-video comments.<br>
The present Invention proposes two formats of the descriptor file, one is proprietary (new/non-standard) &amp; other is 3gp/mp4 format. In case of 3gp/ mp4 format any audio or audio-video comment inserted by user is recorded as per the 3gp/mp4 specification. But all other information like metadata &amp; text comment is written as user defined atom. Due to this the descriptor file created by application can be played in any 3gp/mp4 compliant player. But as complete metadata is in user defined atom of the 3gp/mp4 descriptor file all players other than l-VB application can not co-relate descriptor file with its associated video blog &amp; can not play comments at right time.<br>
The present invention also suggests a proprietary way of writing metadata &amp; data as a descriptor file. In this case l-VB records metadata &amp; data required to associate descriptor file with a specific video blog along with the timing information. The disadvantage of this method is that only l-VB application can play &amp; co-relate descriptor file with its associated video blog &amp; can play comments at right time. There are two ways using which user can insert comments.User can download the blog &amp; can play the blog in l-VB application for inserting comments or he can insert comments while playing streamed blog in I- VB applicationon. Thus after downloading video blog or while streaming the <br>
original blog user can play it in l-VB application &amp; can insert comments in the form of text, audio or audio -video file. The inserted comment does not become part of original blog. The above method helps user to participate in Video Blogging by inserting comments in the form of text, audio &amp; audio-video instantaneously at suitable location while watching original blog in Real Time without modifying it. The comments inserted by user become a separate descriptor file. User needs to upload only descriptor file &amp; not the video blog. Multiple users at a time can download/stream the blog &amp; can participate in video blogging by creating descriptors files &amp; then only uploading descriptor file to server &amp; not the video blog. If there are already such descriptor files created &amp; uploaded by some users &amp; then new user can see original blog &amp; various separate descriptor file on the server. Server shows listing of original blog, comments added &amp; comment to comment added by the user as descriptor files. It is possible to play original video blog &amp; selected descriptor files on line or through web-player if server runs l-VB application. But user can only watch video blog &amp; inserted comments with respect to time &amp; can not insert any comment through web -player.<br>
New user can select the descriptor files of his choice &amp; can download along with original blog. New user opens original blog along with descriptor file/files of his choice. If user selects play option then application starts playing original blog. Application shows two windows on LCD i.e. W1 &amp; W2 &amp; plays original blog in W1. Application checks the metadata in various descriptor files &amp; keeps the track of the type of comment &amp; when it was inserted in original blog. Based on the information available whenever it finds any comment needs to be played at particular instant it pauses the playback of original video blog in W1 &amp; starts playing comment in W2. If the comment is text then it shows text comment in W2. For audio it plays audio comment whereas for audio video comment it plays comment in W2. It resumes playback when user selects resume or when the comment ends. Using the above method it is possible to see/watch all the comments inserted at various point of time during a playback of original video.<br>
The application also provides a quick &amp; easy access of the comments inserted in the blog &amp; directly go to the selected comment &amp; its associated video point in original video blog. User can select original blog along with descriptor files of his choice &amp; then type of comments like text, audio or audio-video. Application provides a listing of all text or audio or audio-video comments along with video thumbnail, which is starting point of associated video in video blog. User can select a comment &amp; can directly jump to that comment &amp; its associated video. The same user if interested can insert a new comment after watching other comments &amp; can upload to server.<br>
The application also allows user to convert descriptor file to a new video blog. In this case it deletes all references to the original video blog. The owner of the video blog can update original video blog by merging some or all descriptor files to the original video blog &amp; can again upload. For example user can merge 3 <br>
descriptor files with original blog out of 6 available on server. He needs to delete descriptor files merged with original file &amp; need to update remaining to upload on to the server. The application also provides an option of playing all comments back-to back.<br>
It is also possible to play/stream few or all the comments selected by user with respect to the time along with original blog at server if server uses l-V blog application.<br>
User can watch original blog along with the comments inserted by other users i.e comments inserted with respect to. the content / time of insertion using streaming player as server streams down the data using the technique described above to play the original blog &amp; comments using l-VB application.<br>
Referring to figure 4 following scenario is explained to describe the overall concept:<br>
Step 1: Userl creates an AV Blog B1 of duration 20 sec and uploads it. B1 is uploaded to the server.<br>
Implementation: This can be any UCC which user wants to publish. Step 2: User2 downloads/Streams B1 and view it.<br>
Implementation: This can be done using IVB player. B1 is a 3gp file and can be played in any compliant player.But IVB player will also allow the viewer to add the comments instantaneously while playing.<br>
Step 3: User2 while viewing adds a text comment TC1 to B1 at 5th Sec. Then uploads, it to the server.<br>
Implementation: This is possible when the user is viewing B1 in IVB player and wishes to insert a comment then the user presses an "insert" button. When the insert button is pressed: Two things happen:<br>
1.	The user is prompted with choice of comment he wishes to add i.e. text, audio or audio-video. Based on this type the other information is derived as below.<br>
2.	The time at which insert button is pressed is noted. Based on this time and the above chosen type of comment the information is stored.<br>
a. Text: The timestamp is stored (in example 5000 ms); the video frame with respect to this time is found out and is stored in user defined atom in Meta data of the descriptor file. The text track is stored as per 3gp file format specification. Text is entered as described in above Section<br>
Step4: User3 adds only audio comment AC1 to B1 at 7th Sec Implementation:<br>
1. Audio: The timestamp is stored (in example 7000 ms); the audio frame with respect to. this time is found out and is stored in user defined atom in Meta data of the descriptor file. The audio track is <br>
stored as per 3gp file format specification. Audio is recorded as described in above Section.<br>
Step5: User4 while viewing adds Audio-Video comment AVC1 to B1 at 10th Sec Implementation:<br>
1. Audio-Video: The timestamp is stored (in example 10000 ms); the nearest video l-frame with respect to. this time is found out and is stored in user defined atom in Meta data of the descriptor file. The audio-video tracks are stored as per 3gp file format specification. Audio video is recorded as described in above Section.<br>
Along with the timestamp and frame number information the associative information like creator's name, parent blog, creation date and time etc is also stored.<br>
Step 6: User 5 can selectively download the comments &amp; original blog B1 to watch blog &amp; comments offline. Or he can view them inline with B1 where in B1 &amp; selected comments would be streamed.<br>
Implementation: This can be broken into two parts and individually explained as below:<br>
1. Selectively Download Comments: This implies that user would be given a choice to select the category of comments he wishes to view. The categories can be: Type of comment, author of the comment, date and time of comment,<br>
-V comments associated with a portion of the blog etc. When he selects a category then all the comments which belong to that category would be displayed either the user can select all or any.<br>
2. View them inline where B1 can either be streamed or downloaded: User can either download comments &amp; original blog to watch it offline or can watch using streaming player .The technique used for local playback &amp; for streamed playback is same for playing comments with respect to time in original blog. This is implemented using the information stored in the descriptor file while addition of comments as described in above steps. The frame number and timing information is used to stop playing/streaming of B1 and start playing/streaming the comment at the appropriate frame number of B1.<br>
a.	Text Comment Play out: The frame number after which this comment is to be played is stored in the user defined data of the meta data in the descriptor file. The play out method is described in section<br>
b.	Audio Comment Play out: The frame number after which this comment is to be played is stored in the user defined data of the meta data in the descriptor file. The play out method is described in section<br>
c.	Audio Video Comment Play out: The frame number after which this comment is to be played is stored in the user defined data of the meta data in the descriptor file. The play out method is described in section<br>
Requirements to implement the invention <br>
•	A Mobile Terminal or An embedded device or any handheld device or PC with camera facility<br>
•	Software/hardware to encode camera frames to the format specified by user<br>
•	Software/hardware to decode frames from the file<br>
•	CPU to control &amp; meet the real time constraint of application<br>
•	Display device, audio capture &amp; playback in real time<br>
•	Media file reader &amp; writer for the format specified by the user<br>
•	Storage device or memory with read, write capability<br>
•	Software/hardware to upload/download video blog on to server<br>
•	Software/hardware to play streamed data from server(streaming playback)<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
•	The new approach l-VB allows adding information in the form of audio- video as a blog or adding audio video comment or combination of text, audio, video comment from mobile/PC instantaneously.<br>
•	The new approach of video blogging is easy, efficient &amp; does allow user to express his views in interactive way as it has methods to co- relate user comment &amp; original content.<br>
SK • Entering text as a comment is difficult &amp; cumbersome particularly if user is using handheld device like Mobile phone. It consumes lot of user time. It is difficult to associate text comment with specific portion of video blog. The new approach of video blogging allows user to insert comment in the form of audio video adds more value &amp; meaning.<br>
•	In the current method the information or comments added by other users in video blog is just one after another &amp; there is no mechanism currently available to co-relate user comments &amp; specific portion of the original video blog. With the new method User can add his audio, video or text comment with respect to specific point in original video while watching.<br>
•	In the current method original blog &amp; comments added by other participants are inseparable. All comments are put just one after another &amp; every comment or information added by any user becomes integral part of the blog due to which blog grows in size depending on the number of users participated &amp; the information added by each user. This problem is solved by the present invention as each comment becomes a separate descriptor file &amp; therefore original blog remains as it is.<br>
•	In the current method User needs to download/stream complete blog<br>
every time whenever he wants to watch or participate. The present invention enables user needs to download original blog &amp; comments of his choice.<br>
•	In the current method as video blog size grows depending on the number of users participated &amp; the content added by them, the user who participate late feels a burden of uploading &amp; downloading/streaming video blog. It overloads server, network &amp; consumes user time &amp; money. This is prevented in the present invention as the size of original blog remains same irrespective of number of user participated &amp; comments added by them.<br>
•	In the current method User has no choice of selecting specific comments of his interest made on his favorite video blog. He needs to download/stream &amp; watch complete blog in order to see who has commented on the blog. The present invention proposes a method wherein user knows how many comments &amp; who commented without downloading/streaming.<br>
•	In the current method User has no choice to select particular comments &amp; watch/play directly. User can select particular comment &amp; download in the present invention. <br>
•	In the current method there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to insert comment (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog &amp; upload only comment. He needs to upload original blog, all previous comments &amp; new comment inserted by him. In the present invention user needs to download/stream only original video blog to insert his comment &amp; needs to upload only comment.<br>
•	In the current method there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to insert comments (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog instantaneously &amp; upload only comments associated with specific portion, specific instant of the original video blog. The present invention allows user to insert a comment &amp; co-relate to specific point or portion of the original video.<br>
•	In the current method there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to see original blog &amp; comments (text, audio, audio- video) inserted till now by various users separately (each comment is a separate entity). In the present invention every comment can become a separate entity.<br>
•	In the current method there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to see original blog &amp; all comments (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog separately associated with specific portion, specific instant of the original video blog. The present invention allows user to watch original video blog &amp; comments inserted by various users associated with specific portion, specific instant of the original video blog.<br>
•	In the current method there is no mechanism or method available which allows user to see original blog &amp; all comments (text, audio, audio-video) on original blog, comment to comment (comment of one user associated with another user's comment) separately associated with specific portion, specific instant of the original video blog or comment of original video blog. The present invention makes it is possible to comment on previously inserted comment.<br>
•	User may wish to insert comment (text, audio, audio-video) at a specific time while watching original blog &amp; may want other users to see his inserted comment played at right/same time while watching video blog. The insertion of comment while watching blog by one user &amp; play-out of original blog along with inserted comment at right time is not supported by current approach but now possible with the new approach.<br>
•	User may wish to insert multiple comments in various forms (text, audio, audio-video) at different point of time while watching original <br>
blog &amp; may want other users to see his inserted comments played at right/same time while watching video blog. The insertion of comment in various forms while watching blog by one user at various point of time &amp; play-out of original blog along with inserted comments at right time is not supported by current approach but now possible with the new approach.<br>
•	User may have a video blog along with comments made by various users in various forms like text, audio, video. User has no choice of selecting comments category wise like text, audio, audio-video etc. This is possible with the new method proposed in the present invention.<br>
