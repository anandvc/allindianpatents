COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"CEMENT ADDITIVE"<br>
MBT HOLDING AG, of Vulkanstrasse 110,  CH-8048 Zurich, Switzerland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
 This invention relates to a cement additive and more particularly, to a cement additive used to improve the fluidity and appearance of strength of cement slurry, cement paste, mortar and concrete.<br>
Various cement additives comprising polycarboxylic acid type copolymers. have been proposed for enhancing the fluidity and flowability of concrete. While this works well for ordinary concretes, it is  not so effective when high strength and high durability are required, as such copolymers tend to entrain an excess of air and retard setting.<br>
In relation to pre-formed concrete products, it is strongly desired to decrease the total time spent in a form and to prevent defects when the form is removed. For such products, good appearance is also highly desirable, when the form is removed after steam curing.  Various polycarboxylate materials to achieve this have been proposed, but none have been entirely satisfactory, causing such problems as retarded setting and low fluidity.<br>
It has now been found that a cement additive containing apolycarboxylic acid type copolymer and a polyalkylene glycol derivative having a specific molecular structure can alleviate and sometimes completely remove all the above-mentioned problems, by having a high dispersing ability for various concretes, improving and retaining the fluidity of concrete, and also making it possible to increase the strength of pre-formed concrete, such that form removal after stetan curing can be carried out relatively early, giving a product with low aeration.<br>
The invention therefore provides a cement additive containing a polycarboxylic acid type copolymer and/or the salts thereof and a polyalkylene glycol derivative, said polycarboxylic acid type copolymer contains at least one species of copolymer, the monomers of which copolymer comprise at least an unsaturated polyalkylene glycol type monomer (A) and an unsatur-ated mono- or dicarboxylic acid type monomer (B).<br>

the monomer (D) is a compound according to the general formula (4): <br>
wherein RI5,R16,R18 and R19 are each independently hydrogen or methyl, provided that not all are methyl; R170 is one or more species of C2-C4 oxyalkylene groups, and in the case of two or more species may be block or random; w is an integer an average from 1 to 300; v and x are each independently an integer from 0 to 2,<br>
The invention also relates to the abovementioned cement additive, wherein the composition ratios of the monomers (A) and (B) in the polycarboxylic acid-type copolymers are 30-100 mole % based on the total mole amount of the monomers, and the average molecular weight of said polycarboxylic acid-type copolymer is from 3,000-<br><br><br>

One or more species of these may be used.<br>
Specific non-limiting examples of polycarboxylic acid type copolymers are those described in JP, A, H5-306152, JP, A, H6-211949, JP, A, H9-286647 and JP, A, HI 0-236858.<br>
The composition ratio of the monomers (A) and (B) in the polycarboxylic acid type copolymers in the invention to total amount of the monomers is preferably 30-100 mole %, and the average molecular weight is preferably 3,000-100,000.<br>
In the polyalkylene glycol derivatives of the invention, the average molecular weight is 1,000-150,000, preferably 1,000-100,000, more preferably 4,000-50,000, the alkylene is one or more C2-C4 species, and it may be block or random in the case of 2 or more species, the terminal groups of polyalkylene glycol are hydrogen, C18 maximum alkyl or phenyl groups.<br>
In a cement additive of the invention, the preferred proportions are 100 weight parts of polycarboxylic acid type copolymers and 10-50 weight parts of polyalkylene glycol derivatives.<br>
A cement additive of the invention is preferably used in such a quantity that polycarboxylic acid type copolymers are present in the proportion 0,05-1.0 % by weight based on cement weight and polyalkylene glycol derivatives are present in the proportion 0.005-0.5 % by weight based on cement weight. However, the amount of the cement additive according to the invention to be used can be appropriately determined according to a cement composition used, it basically being the amount which is necessary to attain the desired strength development and improved time to form removal after steam curing,<br><br>
and it is possible that suitable proportions outside these limits may be found.<br>
A cement additive according to the invention may be used for stiff consistency concrete, plastic concrete, high fluidity concrete, high strength concrete, cement paste as generally used, mortar, grout, concrete and the like, although the beneficial effects of the invention are most noticeable in high strength concrete in which the water/cement ratio is low.<br>
A cement additive according to the invention may be mixed, if desired, with other additives to expand its versatility. Typical examples of other additives are conventional water-reducing agents (lignosulfonate, oxycarboxylate, polyalkylsulfonate, polycarboxylate), air content-regulating agents, drying shrinkage reducing agents, accelerators, retarders, foaming agents, anti-foaming agents, anti-rust agents, set acceleration agents, high early-strengthening agents, efflorescence-inhibiting agents, bleeding inhibitors, pumping aids, and water-soluble polymers.<br>
A cement additive according to the invention exhibits a high dispersing ability of a degree never obtained by use only of polycarboxylic acid-type copolymers to various concretes such as ordinary concrete, high strength concrete and steam curing concrete. Without restricting the scope of the invention in any way, it is believed that this is the result of a synergistic effec+ of the polycarboxylic acid type copolymers and the polyalkylene glycol derivatives. It both enhances the fluidity of concrete and maintains this fluidity, thereby making it possible to increase the strength development and decrease the time for form removal after steam curing. The latter is particularly valuable in that it permits economies such as the reduction of time spent in a form used and the reduction of defects in concrete products manufactured in a concrete factory.<br>
The invention is now further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples wherein are used the cement additives containing polycarboxylic acid type copolymers and polyalkylene glycol derivatives according to the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
The compositions of the polycarboxylic acid type copolymers in the cement<br><br>
additives used in the examples and in the comparative examples are shown in Table 1. Said polycarboxylic acid type copolymers can be obtained by known polymerization methods described in, for example, JP, A, H5-306152, JP, A, H6-211949, JP, A, H9-286647 and JP, A, H10-236858. The polyalkylene glycol derivatives in the cement additives used in the examples and in the comparative examples are also shown in Table 2.<br>
In order to illustrate the effect of these cement additives, the concrete compositions (shown in Table 3) are designed to have slump of 18.5±1 cm and air content 4.5%. The total quantity of materials in each case is 80 litres, and all the materials are added to a 100 litre pan-type forced mixing mixer, and mixed for 120 sec. to give the concrete compositions. The concrete compositions thus obtained are measured for slump , air content, setting time and compressive strength. Further, the compressive strength in the case of accelerating the appearance of strength by steam curing was measured.<br>
1)	Slump: measured according to JIS A 1101,<br>
2)	Air content: measured according to JIS A 1128,<br>
3)	Setting time: measured according to JIS A 6204 Supplement 1,<br>
4)	Compressive strength<br>
Ordinary curing: measured according to JIS A 1108,<br>
Steam curing: the sample is pre-cured at 20°C for 2 hr, then warmed to 65°C in 2 hrs 30 min, kept at 65°C for 4 hrs. After allowing to cool to 20°C over 4 hrs, the testing is carried out according to JIS A 1108.<br>
(Materials used) Mixing water: tap water,<br>
Cement: ordinary portland cement (density 3.16 g/cm3), Fine aggregate: Oi River pit sand (specific gravity 2.59, FM=2.74), Coarse aggregate: Oume crushed stone (specific gravity 2.65, MS [median size?]=20mm).<br>
The results of the above measurement are shown in Table 4. In the Table, the examples 1-13 and the comparative examples 1-4 are for the results obtained from the ordinary cement, and the examples 14,15 and the comparative examples 5, 6 are those<br><br>
obtained from the high strength concrete.<br>
The examples 1-7 show the cases in which the type of the polycarboxylic acid type copolymers is changed, and the examples 1 and 8-13 are the cases in which the type of the polyalkylene glycol derivatives is changed.<br>
The comparative examples 1 and 5 show the cases in which a polyalkylene glycol derivative is not used, and the comparative examples 2-4 and 6 are the cases in which compounds other than the polycarboxylic acid type copolymers in the invention are used.<br>
As is evident from the comparison between the comparative example 1 and the examples 1-13, and from the comparison between the comparative example 5 and the examples 14 and 15, the ordinary concrete and the high strength concrete, in which the cement additives together with the polyalkylene glycol derivatives of the invention are used, both show a tendency to accelerate setting, whereby the slump values are large (fluidity) and their slump lowering over 60 min is small (high flowability), demonstrating a preferable compressive strength both for ordinary curing and steam curing.<br>
The comparative examples 2-4 and 6 are those in which compounds other than the polycarboxylic acid type copolymers in the invention are used, though in these examples the development of compressive strength is not sufficient, because there is demonstrated a retardation of setting.<br><br>
