1,3-dioxan-2-yl]propylcarbamate.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be<br>
prepared according to various methods, illustrated by the following schemes.<br>
Thus, a method of preparation (Scheme 1) consists in reacting an amine of general formula (II), in which R1 and n are as defined in general formula (I), with a carbonate of general formula (III), in which U represents a hydrogen atom or a nitro group and R2 is as defined in general formula (I), in a solvent such as toluene or dichloroethane, at a temperature of between and 80°C.<br><br>
The carbonates of general formula (III) can be prepared according to any method described in the literature for example by reacting an alcohol of general formula HOR2 with phenyl or 4-nitrophenyl<br>
chloroformate, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) for which R2 represents more particularly an optionally substituted phenyl group (Ar) can be prepared by reacting an amine of general formula (II), as defined<br><br>
8<br>
above, with an aryl chloroformate of general formula (IIIa) in a solvent such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the ...solvent.,, <br>
According to Scheme 2, the compounds of general formula (I) for which R2 represents more particularly a group of general formula CHR3CONHR4 can be prepared by reacting an amine of general formula (II), as defined above, with carbon dioxide in the presence of a base such as caesium carbonate and a phase-transfer agent such as tetra-n-butylammonium iodide, in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, and then with a haloacetamide of general formula (IV) in which V represents a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom and R3 and R4 are as defined in general formula (I).<br><br><br>
9<br>
A variant (Scheme 3) for obtaining the compounds of general formula (I) in which R2 represents<br>
more particularly a group of general formula CHR3CONHR4 consists in reacting an amine of general formula (II), as defined above, with a carbonate of general formula (IIIb) in which U represents a hydrogen atom or a nitro group, R3 is as defined in general formula (I) and R5 represents a methyl or ethyl group. The carbamate ester of general formula (Ia) thus obtained is then converted to a compound of general formula (I), either by direct aminolysis by means of an amine of general formula R4NH2 in which R4 is as defined in general formula (I), or by hydrolysis to an acid of general formula (Ia), in which R5 represents a hydrogen atom, followed by coupling with an amine of general formula R4NH2 in which R4 is as defined in general formula (I). The aminolysis reaction can be carried out in a solvent such as methanol or a mixture of solvents such as methanol and tetrahydrofuran. The coupling reaction can be carried out according to any known method from the literature, for example using isobutyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine.<br><br>
10 Scheme 3<br><br>
The carbonates of general formula (IIIb) can be prepared in a manner similar to the carbonates of formula (III) .<br>
Another variant (Scheme 4) for obtaining the compounds of general formula (I) in which R2 represents more particularly a group of general formula CHR3CONHR4 consists in reacting a derivative of general formula (IIa), in which Z represents a hydroxyl, mesylate or tosylate group, or a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, and R1 and n are as defined in general formula (I), with an oxazolidinedione of general structure (V) in which R3 is as defined in general formula (I), to provide the oxazolidinedione derivative of general structure (VI). When Z represents a hydroxyl group, the reaction can be carried out according to the conditions of Mitsunobu (Synthesis, 1981, 1-28), for<br><br><br>
The amines of general formula (II) can be prepared according to the methods of preparation described in patent applications EP 0461958, WO 97/20836 and WO 98/55474, optionally adapted<br><br>
12<br>
according to techniques known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The compounds of general formulae (IIa), (IIIa) , (IV) and (V), and also the amines R4NH2, when their method of preparation is not described, are commercially available or described in the literature, or else can be prepared according to methods which are described therein or which are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of general formula (Ia), in which R1, R3 and n are as defined in general formula (I) and R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group, and the compounds of general formula (VI), in which R1, R3 and n are as defined in general formula (I), are novel and are also part of the invention. They are of use as synthetic intermediates for preparing the compounds of general formula (I).<br>

preparation of some compounds of the invention. These examples are not limiting and merely illustrate the invention. The microanalyses, the IR and NMR spectra and/or the LOMS (liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy) confirm the structures and the purities of the compounds obtained.<br>

The compounds of the invention have been the subject of pharmacological tests to determine their inhibitory effect on the enzyme FAAH (Fatty Acid Amido Hydrolase).<br>
The inhibitory activity was demonstrated in a radioenzymatic assay based on measuring the product of hydrolysis (ethanolamine [1-3H]) of anandamide [ethanolamine 1-3H] by FAAH (Life Sciences (1995), 56, 1999-2005 and Journal of Pharmacology and Experimented<br><br>
30<br>
Therapeutics (1997), 283, 729-734). Thus, mouse brains (minus the cerebellum) are removed and stored at -80°C. Membrane homogenates are prepared extemporaneously by homogenization of the tissues with a Polytron in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The enzyme reaction is then carried out in 70 µl of buffer containing bovine serum albumin without fatty acids (1 mg/ml). The compounds tested, at various concentrations, the anandamide [ethanolamine 1-3H] (specific activity of 15-20 C1/mmol) diluted to 10 µM with non-radiolabelled anandamide and the membrane preparation 1400 µg of frozen tissue per assay) are added successively. After 15 minutes at 25°C, the enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 140 µl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) . The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes and then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3 500 g. An aliquot (30 µl) of the aqueous phase containing the ethanol amine [1-3H] is counted by liquid scintillation.<br>
Under these conditions, the most active compounds of the invention exhibit IC50 values (concentration which inhibits by 50% the control enzyme activity of FAAH) of between 0.005 and 1 µM.<br>
It therefore appears that the compounds<br>
according to the invention have an inhibitory activity on the FAAH enzyme.<br>
The in vivo activity of the compounds of the invention was evaluated in a test for analgesia.<br><br>
31<br>
Thus, intraperitoneal (1.p.) administration of PBQ (phenylbenzoquinone, 2 mg/kg in a solution of 0.9% NaCl<br>
containing 5% of ethanol) to male OF1 mice weighing 25 to 30 g causes abdominal pulls, on average 30 twists or contractions during the 5 to 15 minute period after injection. The compounds tested are administered orally or 1.p- in suspension in Tween 80 at 0.5%, 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 120 minutes before administration of PBQ. Under these conditions, the most potent compounds of the invention reduce by 50 to 70% the number of pulls induced by the PBQ, within a dose range of between 1 and 30 mg/kg.<br>
The FAAH enzyme (Chemistry and Physics of Lipids, (2000), 108, 107-121) catalyses the hydrolysis of endogenous derivatives of amides and of esters of various fatty acids such as N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), N-palmitoylethanolamine, N-oleoylethanolamine, oleamide or<br>
2-arachidonoylglycerol. These derivatives exercise various pharmacological activities by interacting, inter alia, with cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors. The compounds of the invention block this degradation pathway and increase the tissue level of these endogenous substances. They can be used in this respect in the prevention and treatment of any pathological condition in which endogenous cannabinoids and/or any other substrate metabolized by the FAAH enzyme are involved.<br><br>
