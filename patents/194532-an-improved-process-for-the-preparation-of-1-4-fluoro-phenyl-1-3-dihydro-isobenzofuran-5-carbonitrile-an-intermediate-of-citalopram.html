				<td>INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 5-bromo-l-(4"-flurophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran of formula-I and l-(4"-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile of formula-II. The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of the compound of formula-1.<br><br>
The compounds of the formulae-I &amp; II are key intermediates used in the synthesis of known antidepressant drug l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-l-(4"-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile (citalopram), of the formula-Ill) and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof<br><br>
The process for the preparation of antidepressant citalopram and its pharmaceutical properties was first disclosed in DE Patent no. 2,657,013 (1977) corresponding to US Patent no, 4,136,193 (1979). Subsequently it was also disclosed in GB patent no.l,526,331 (1978).<br>
The basic process for the preparation of citalopram described in the above-referred patents involves two major routes illustrated in Scheme-1 and Scheme-2. Major difference in these two routes is introduction of dimethylaminopropyl side chain at an early stage (Scheme-1) or at a later stage (Scheme-2).<br><br>
In the first route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-lV is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get a benzophenone derivative of the formula-V. This benzophenone derivative is reacted with 3-N,N-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride to get the dihydroxy intermediate of the Formula-VI. Cyclization of this with an acid catalyst resulted in the formation of phthalane derivative of the Formula-VII. This bromophthalane derivative is reacted with copper cyanide to get the citalopram base of the Formula-Ill.<br><br>
In the second route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-IV is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get the corresponding benzophenone derivative of the Formula-V. This compound is reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to get the dihydroxy compound of the formula-VIII, which is cyclized with an acid catalyst to get the<br><br><br>
phthalane derivative of the formula-I. The bromo group is replaced with a cyano group and alkylated with the required side chain to get the citalopram base.<br>
Bogeso (EP patent no.171,943, corresponding to US patent no.4,650,884) has indicated that the methods described in the above patents for the preparation of citalopram possess some problems in the scale-up to commercial production.<br>
In an attempt to develop a shorter route for the preparation of citalopram and to avoid the risk involved in the metalation step used previously, Bogeso started with 5-cyanophthalide of the Formula-IX and surprisingly found that cyano group survived the cyclization step where 70% sulfuric acid was used at 80°C temperature (Scheme-3).<br><br><br>
Further processes have been disclosed in international patent application nos. WO 98/019511, WO 98/019512, WO 98/019513, WO 99/030548, WO 00/011926, WO 00/013648, and WO 00/023431. International patent application no. WO 98/019511 discloses a process for the manufacture of citalopram wherein a compound of the Formula-X was reduced with sodium borohydride to get a compound of the Formula-XII. However, yield is only 40% and large quantity (-50 times) of alcohol was used. This compound of the Formula-XII is subjected to ring closure and the resulting 5-substituted dihydroisobenzofuran derivative is converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative and alkylated with (3-dimethylamino) propyl halogenide to obtain citalopram.<br><br><br>
wo 98/019512 and WO 98/019513 relate to methods wherein a 5-amino-, 5-carboxy- or 5-(sec-aminocarbonyl) phthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resulting 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram.<br>
International patent application no. 99/030548 discloses a process for the preparation of citalopram wherein cyano group was introduced from the corresponding 5-aldehyde analogue of citalopram.<br>
International patent application nos. WO 00/011926 and WO 00/013648 disclose an improved process for the preparation of citalopram wherein 5-halogen (C1 or Br) analogue of citalopram is activated by using palladium or nickel complex catalyst to introduce the corresponding cyano group present in citalopram.<br>
International patent application no. WO 00/023431 discloses a process for introduction of cyano group present in citalopram via the corresponding 5-oxazolyl analogue of citalopram.<br>
A major drawback in the scale up to commercial production of citalopram by following the original patent process (disclosed in US patent no.4,136,193) is removal of impurities present in citalopram to an acceptable level of pharmaceutical quality. Methods followed to improve the quality of citalopram are either by chemical purification (via acid addition salt where ever applicable) or by high vacuum distillation. Chemical method does not<br><br><br>
seem to remove the impurities up to the acceptable level because some of the impurities like compound of Formula-VI, Formula-VII or Formula-XIII have similar salt formation properties with an acid.<br>
All the intermediates involved in the original patent for the preparation of citalopram have very high boiling point (~200°C at 
Second route of the original patent for the preparation of citalopram involves purification of intermediate compounds of the Formula I and II by high vacuum distillation (180-200°C at 
Third and simplified route (disclosed in EP Patent no. 171,943) for the preparation of citalopram involves the introduction of 5-cyano group present in citalopram at the beginning itself This route also has major drawback of removal of impurities present in citalopram. Repeated recrystallization technique was described in making pharmaceutically acceptable quality citalopram. Also, there is a considerable loss if required product (citalopram) in this technique.<br>
All other international patents published between 1998 and 2000 are involving with various methods to introduce 5-cyano group from different functional groups. All these methods are focusing on new chemistry and are not adaptable for commercial production.<br>
Citalopram has become a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market and has shown great promise as a valuable antidepressant drug with few side effects. Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of citalopram, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of citalopram.<br>
We observed that a promising approach for such a process is to (a) improve the quality of one or more of the isolable intermediates by simple techniques (b) avoid costly and risky reagents like lithium aluminum hydride and (c) minimize the effluents like large quantity of phosphoric acid.<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding that if the (3-dimethylamino) propyl side chain present in citalopram is introduced at an early stage, it is difficuh to remove the related impurities by conventional methods. Further if a simple crystallization technique for the formation of one or more of the isolable intermediates, it becomes easy to get citalopram with acceptable pharmaceutical quality.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-II, which is useful for the preparation of citalopram of the formula-Ill.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-II useful for the preparation of citalopram of the formula-Ill avoiding the formation of impurities.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-II useful for the preparation of citalopram with high yield (&gt;90%) and high purity (&gt;99%)<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-II useful for the citalopram of the formula-Ill, which is simple, economical and environmentally safe.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-II, which is useful for the preparation of citalopram employing a simple crystallization technique.<br>
Further objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the formula-II, which is useful for the preparation of citalopram by replacing the costly and hazardous lithium aluminum hydride with simple sodium borohydride and with no involvement of additional steps.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the formula-II which is usefial for the preparation of citalopram by replacing or reducing the acid catalyst used in the cyclization step of the synthesis.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of intermediate of formula-II,<br><br>
which is useful for the preparation of citalopram which comprises:<br>
(i)       reducing the magnesium salt of a benzophenone derivative of the formula-V<br><br><br>
(iii) reacting the compound of the formula-I obtained in step (ii) with copper (I) cyanide in dimethylformamide solvent medium and isolating the resulting cyano compound, by re-crystallization by using polar and or alcoholic solvents to obtain the compound of the formula-II<br><br><br>
The intermediate compound of the formula-II so formed may be converted into citalopram of the formula-Ill by any conventional methods. The process for the preparation of citalopram based on the present invention has been made the subject matter of our co-pending application no 157/MAS/01.<br>
Similarly, the process of preparing another key intermediate of the formula-I useful for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula-II which is also a key intermediate for the preparation of citalopram has been made the subject matter of our above said co¬pending application no 946/MAS/01, which is divided out of our application no 157/MAS/Ol.<br>
In another co-pending application no 948/MAS/01, which is divided out of our application no 157/MAS/Ol we have described and claimed a process for preparing another intermediate of the formula-VIII useful for the preparation of the intermediate of the formulae-I &amp; II which is also a key intermediate for the preparation of citalopram.<br>
The reduction in step (i) may be effected at a temperature in the range of -25°C to 25°C preferably at a temperature in the range of -10°C to 0°C. The protic solvent used in step (i) may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, t-butanol and the like.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the non-polar solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane and the like may be used in the step (ii). The acid catalyst such as p-toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and sulphuric acid and the like may be used.<br>
The crystallization method employed for the isolation of the compound of formula-II consists of dissolving the crude compound of the formula-II formed in single solvent like methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or mixed solvent like isopropyl alcohol/methanol, isopropyl alcohol/dimethylformamide, methanol/dimethylformamide, etc. The ratio of the combination may be 4-5:1-3, preferably 3-4:1-2.<br>
The isolated intermediate of formula-II by the process of the present invention is found to be of very high purity (&gt;99% by HPLC) with a melting point of 96-97°C. Further confirmation of the quality was checked by converting this intermediate to the required<br><br>
citalopram hydrobromide salt by known method (US patent no.4,136,193) without requiring any re-crystallization process. It is interesting to note that the intermediate of formula-II has got good crystallization property leaving all the impurities in the solvent medium of crystallization.<br>
This simplification has led to the synthesis of this crucial intermediate of the formula II in a very simple and easy to adopt manner suitable for any commercial scale. Also, without any repeated re-crystallization techniques, citalopram hydrobromide could be prepared.<br>
The advantage of the invention is that the compound of the formula-II can be prepared without isolating the intermediate of the formula-I, which enhances the yield of the compound of the formula-II, Consequently when the process is employed for the preparation of citalopram flirther increases the yield of citalopram.<br>

The solids formed were filtered and the wet cake washed with 20ml of isopropyl alcohol to get white crystalline solid. M.P. is 97-98°C. Purity by HPLC is 98.5%.<br><br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
1.	Replacing lithium aluminum hydride with sodium borohydride is very much cost effective and free of any hazardous nature.<br>
2.	Simple crystallization method for the cyano compound of the formula-II has avoided the high vacuum distillation of the corresponding bromo derivative of the formula-I.<br>
3.	The resulting compound of the formula-II is produced in high yield (&gt;90%) and of high purity (&gt;98%).<br>
4.	The process is useful for any commercial scale and environmentally safe and economical.<br><br><br>
