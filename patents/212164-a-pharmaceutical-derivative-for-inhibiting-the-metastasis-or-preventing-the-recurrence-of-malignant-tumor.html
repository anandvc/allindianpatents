The present invention relates to a polysaccharide derivative for   inhibiting the metastasis or preventing the<br>
recurrence of a malignant tumor. More particularly, the<br>
«<br>
present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the metastasis or preventing the recurrence of a malignant tumor, which comprises as the active ingredient a polysaccharide derivative comprising a polysaccharide having a carboxyl group bound to an active substance having an anti-tumor activity, for example, a camptothecin derivative of the formula (I) or (II) as mentioned below, via an amino acid or a peptide consisting of 2 to 8 amino acids which are the same or different, or a<br>
salt thereof.<br>
&gt;<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Malignant tumors are one of the main causes of death in the developed countries, and the majority of malignant tumors related deaths are due to metastasis into distant organs or recurrence accompanied by metastasis to distant<br><br>
organs after a topical therapy.  The metastasis to distant organs may be caused by hematogenous metastasis or lymphogenous metastasis, and it is known that a patient having lymphogenous metastasis has a high risk of recurrence of a malignant tumor after topical therapy.  The main organs of recurrence are brain, lung, liver, and bone. Especially, a tumor in digestive apparatus, for example, colon cancer from which a large number of patients are suffered, may often invade and spread to the liver, and a breast cancer and a lung cancer as well often invade and spread to the liver.  Further, a lymphoma and a lymphatic leukemia may spread mainly to the lymph system, and it has been reported that the metastasis to liver was observed in high rate by autopsy.<br>
In order to inhibit the recurrence including the metastasis to distant organs such a metastasis to the liver and to prolong life, a chemotherapy, etc. is employed as a supportive care after a topical therapy, but the chemotherapy has a potent toxicity and cannot be used for chronic administration.  In addition, it has scarcely been reported that the lifetime is more prolonged by a supportive care of chemotherapy than a topical therapy alone.  For example, in the trials of post-surgery chemotherapy for the patient who is the subject of surgery of advanced gastric cancer, one of the cancers of digestive<br><br>
organs, clinical tests of various agents for anti-malignant tumors have been tried, but any therapeutic method exhibiting a remarkably better survival rate than a surgery alone has not been established yet.<br>
Under these circumstances, it has been desired to find a new agent effective in inhibiting recurrence or in prolonging life after topical therapy, which is applicable to the lymph node and the distant organs of metastasis with little side effects, and is suitable for chronic administration.<br>
On the other hand, WO 94/19376, WO 97/46260, WO 97/38727, JP-A-10-72467 and JP-A-10-95802 disclose a polysaccharide derivative comprising a polysaccharide bound to an active substance having an anti-tumor activity via an amino acid or a peptide.<br>
However, these publications disclose the use of these polysaccharides in the treatment of cancers by accumulating at the tumor site and killing the tumor cells, but never indicate activities of inhibiting metastasis or preventing recurrence of a malignant tumor.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the<br>
metastasis or preventing the recurrences of a malignant<br>
»<br><br>
tumor.<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied, and have found that a polysaccharide derivative comprising a polysaccharide having a carboxyl group bound to an active substance having an anti-tumor activity via an amino acid or a peptide exhibits an excellent effect in the. inhibition of metastasis and/or prevention of recurrence of a malignant tumor, and have accomplished the present invention* That is, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the metastasis or preventing the recurrence of a malignant tumor, which comprises as the active ingredient a polysaccharide derivative comprising a polysaccharide having a carboxyl group bound to an active substance having an anti-tumor activity via an amino acid or a peptide consisting of 2 to 8 amino acids which are the same or different, or a salt thereof.<br>

(Compound A; the compound obtained in Preparation 1 as described below and Irinotecan (CPT-11)) was dissolved in a physiological saline solution, and each amount as indicated in Table 1 as mentioned below was administered intravenously to the mice on the 4th, 8th and 12th day after the implantation, and the mice were observed for 120 days after the implantation of tumor.  In the control group<br>
(untreated with test compound), only a physiological saline solution was administered.  The survival time (days) was measured in both the test compound-treated groups and the control group, and the prolongation rate of survival was calculated according to the following equation.  The results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1.<br><br><br>
Preparation 1 as mentioned below (Compound A) exhibited an excellent activity of prolonging lifetime in M5076 liver metastatic models. Meanwhile, Irinotecan is not known as an agent for inhibiting the metastasis or preventing the reoccurrence of a malignant tumor, but it was merely tested as a drug of camptothecin derivatives. Experiment 2 (HT-29 metastatic models)<br>
A segment (2 mm2) of HT-29 cells (human colon cancer) was implanted into the vermiform appendix of lOONCr nu/nu female mice (5 to 6 weeks old, 10 animals per group) .  A test compound (Compound A; the compound obtained in Preparation 1 as mentioned below, Compound B; the compound obtained in Preparation 4 as mentioned below, and<br><br>
Irinotechan (CPT-11)) was dissolved in a physiological saline solution, and each amount as indicated in Table 2 as mentioned below was administered intravenously to the mice on the 15th/ 19th, 23rd and 25th day after the implantation of tumor.  On the other hand, in the control group (untreated with test compound), only a physiological saline solution was administered.  The presence or absence of the metastasis of each organ was checked on the 84th day after the implantation of tumor.  The results are shown in the following Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Experiment 3 (HT-29 metastatic models)<br>
A segment (2 mm2) of HT-29 cells (human colon cancer) was implanted into the vermiform appendix of lOONCr nu/nu female mice (5 to 6 weeks old, 10 animals per group). Since the lymph node metastasis was observed on the 49th day after the implantation of tumor, a test compound (Compound A; the compound obtained in Preparation 1 as mentioned below, and Irinotechan (CPT-11)) was dissolved in a physiological saline solution, and each amount as indicated in Table 3 as mentioned below was administered intravenously to the mice on the 51st, 55th, 59th, and 63rd day after the implantation of tumor.  On the other hand, in the control group (untreated with test compound), only a physiological saline solution was administered.  The presence or absence of the metastasis of each organ was checked on the 84th day after the implantation of tumor. The results are shown in the following Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Experiment 4 (H460 metastatic models)<br>
A segment (2 mm2) of H460 cells (human lung cancer) was implanted into the left lung of lOONCr nu/nu female mice (5 to 6 weeks old, 10 animals per group).  Since the metastasis was observed on the 14th day after the implantation of tumor in another control group, a test compound (Compound A; the compound obtained in Preparation 1 as mentioned below, Compound B; the compound obtained in Preparation 4 as mentioned below, and Irinotechan (CPT-11)) was dissolved in a physiological saline solution, and each amount as indicated in Table 4 as mentioned below was administered intravenously to the mice on the 14th, 18th, 22nd and 26th day after the implantation of tumor.  On the other hand, in the control group (untreated with test compound), only a physiological saline solution was administered.  The presence or absence of the metastasis of each organ was checked on the 36th day after the implantation of tumor.  The results are shown in the following Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
