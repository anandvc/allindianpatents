ENDOSCOPIC ANCILLARY ATTACHMENT DEVICES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to methods and devices for attaching one or more ancillary<br>
devices to an endoscope.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Minimally invasive procedures are desirable because such procedures can reduce pain<br>
and provide relatively quick recovery times as compared with conventional open medical<br>
procedures. Many minimally invasive procedures are performed with an endoscope (including<br>
without limitation laparoscopes). Such procedures permit a physician to position, manipulate,<br>
and view medical instruments and accessories inside the patient through a small access opening<br>
in the patient's body. Laparoscopy is a term used to describe such an "endosurgical" approach<br>
using an endoscope (often a rigid laparoscope). In this type of procedure, accessory devices are<br>
often inserted into a patient through trocars placed through the body wall.<br>
[0003] Still less invasive treatments include those that are performed through insertion of an<br>
endoscope translumenally, i.e., through a natural body orifice to a treatment site. Examples of<br>
this approach include, but are not limited to, cystoscopy, hysteroscopy,<br>
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy. Many of these procedures employ the use of a<br>
flexible endoscope during the procedure. Flexible endoscopes often have a flexible, steerable<br>
articulating section near the distal end that can be controlled by the user by utilizing controls at<br>
the proximal end.<br>
[0004] Some flexible endoscopes are relatively small (lmm to 3mm in diameter), and may have<br>
no integral accessory channel (also called biopsy channels or working channels). Other flexible<br>
endoscopes, including gastroscopes and colonoscopes, have integral working channels having a<br>
diameter of about 2.0mm to 3.5mm for the purpose of introducing and removing medical devices<br>
and other accessory devices to perform diagnosis or therapy within the patient. As a result, the<br>
accessory devices used by a physician can be limited in size by the diameter of the accessory<br>
channel of the scope used. Additionally, the physician may be limited to a single accessory<br>
device when using the standard endoscope having one working channel.<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
[0005] Certain specialized endoscopes are available, such as large working channel endoscopes<br>
having a working channel of 5mm in diameter, which can be used to pass relatively large<br>
accessories, or to provide capability to suction large blood clots. Other specialized endoscopes<br>
include those having two working channels. One disadvantages of such large diameter/multiple<br>
working channel endoscopes can be that such devices can be relatively expensive. Further, such<br>
large diameter/multiple working channel endoscopes can have an outer diameter that makes the<br>
endo scope relatively stiff, or otherwise difficult to intubate.<br>
[0006] It is thus often desirable to position an ancillary device, such as a tool or a working<br>
channel for receiving a tool, along side an external surface an endoscope. While various<br>
techniques are known for attaching ancillary devices to an endoscope. one drawback of current<br>
techniques is the potential for the ancillary device to move as the endoscope is inserted through a<br>
tortuous pathway. This can affect the surgeon's ability to control the device and to maintain the<br>
device within a desired field of view of the imaging capability of the endoscope.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, there remains a need for improved methods and devices for attaching an<br>
one or more ancillary devices to an endoscope.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] The present invention provides methods and devices for attaching an ancillary device,<br>
such as an accessory channel or a surgical tool, to an endoscope. In one exemplary embodiment,<br>
an ancillary attachment device is provided and includes a clamp having an axial pathway formed<br>
therethrough and configured to receive an endoscope and an ancillary device.   The axial pathway<br>
is expandable to allow the clamp to expand to be positioned radially around an endoscope and an<br>
ancillary device extending axially adjacent to the endoscope, and to allow the clamp to close<br>
around the endoscope and the ancillary device to mate and maintain the ancillary device in a<br>
substantially fixed position relative to the endoscope.<br>
[0009] While the clamp can have a variety of configurations, in one embodiment the clamp can<br>
include a plurality of segments spaced axially apart from one another and defining the axial<br>
pathway extending therethrough. In certain exemplary embodiments, each segment can include<br>
a tool engaging portion adapted to be disposed radially around and to engage a shaft of an<br>
-2-<br><br>
endoscope, and a tool sealing portion adapted to scat an ancillary device therein to attach the<br>
ancillary device to the endoscope. The tool engaging portion can be in the form of a ring-shaped<br>
member, and the tool seating portion can be in the form of a protrusion formed in the ring-shaped<br>
member and defining a groove for seating a portion of an ancillary device. In use, the tool<br>
seating portion can maintain an ancillary device in a fixed radial position relative to an<br>
endoscope. In another embodiment, each segment can include first and second terminal ends<br>
that overlap to form a circular member. At least one of the terminal ends of each segment can be<br>
mated to one another. In other embodiments, the clamp can be in the form of a coiled body<br>
having a plurality of successive turns, with each turn of the coiled body forming a segment. The<br>
clamp can also include a variety of other features to facilitate mating of an ancillary device to an<br>
endoscope. For example, the clamp include a coating disposed on at least a portion of an internal<br>
surface of the clamp to prevent slippage between the clamp and an endoscope and/or ancillary<br>
device extending therethrough.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, an endoscopic kit is provided and includes an endoscope having<br>
an elongate shaft with a viewing element located at a distal end thereof, an ancillary device<br>
configured to be positioned axially adjacent to the endoscope, and at least one attachment device<br>
having a plurality of axially spaced, expandable segments sized to be disposed radially around a<br>
portion of the endoscope and the ancillary device to mate the ancillary device to the endoscope.<br>
The attachment device can be adapted to maintain the ancillary device in a substantially fixed<br>
radial position relative to the endoscope, yet to allow axial sliding of the ancillary device relative<br>
to the endoscope. in an exemplary embodiment, the kit includes a plurality of attachment<br>
devices for mating an ancillary device to an endoscope at a plurality of locations.<br>
[0011] A method for attaching an ancillary device to an endoscope is also provided, and in one<br>
embodiment the method can include positioning an ancillary device axially adjacent to an<br>
elongate insertion portion of an endoscope, and positioning at least one radially expandable<br>
attachment device radially around the endoscope and the ancillary device to attach the ancillary<br>
device to the endoscope such that the ancillary device moves in coordination with the endoscope.<br>
The attachment device(s) can maintain the ancillary device in a substantially fixed radial position<br>
relative to the endoscope, yet allow axial sliding of the ancillary device relative to the endoscope.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of radially expandable attachment devices arc disposed<br>
-3-<br><br>
radially around the endoscope and the ancillary device at a plurality of locations along a length<br>
of the endoscope and the ancillary device.<br>
[0012] Various techniques can be used to position the attachment device(s) around, the<br>
endoscope and the ancillary device, and the technique will vary depending on the configuration<br>
of the attachment device(s). In one embodiment, the attachment device can have a coiled<br>
configuration that is positioned around the endoscope and the ancillary device by rotating the<br>
attachment device around the endoscope and the ancillary device. In another embodiment, the<br>
attachment device can include a plurality of ring-shaped segments each having first and second<br>
terminal ends. The attachment device can be positioned around the endoscope and the ancillary<br>
device by separating the terminal ends of each segment to expand the attachment device, and<br>
positioning the expanded attachment device around the endoscope and the ancillary device. The<br>
terminal ends of each segment can come together to engage the endoscope and the ancillary<br>
device. The attachment device(s) can also include other features, such as a groove formed on an<br>
internal surface thereof and adapted to seat the ancillary device therein to maintain the ancillary<br>
device in a fixed radially position relative to the endoscope.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall<br>
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices<br>
and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the devices and<br>
methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-<br>
limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by<br>
the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment<br>
may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0021] The present invention generally provides methods and devices for attaching one or more<br>
ancillary devices to an endoscope. The ancillary device can be any device that is used in<br>
conjunction with endoscopic procedures, such as, by way of non-limiting example, an accessory<br>
channel, tube, or sleeve, an indwelling tube or feeding tube, and surgical tools such as graspers,<br>
snares, etc. The ancillary device(s) can be positioned adjacent to and along side an external<br>
surface of an insertion portion of an endoscope for inserting into a body lumen, and one or more<br>
attachment devices can be used to mate the ancillary device(s) to the endoscope at one or more<br>
attachment locations. In use, the attachment device(s) will allow the ancillary device to move in<br>
coordination with the endoscope, thus allowing the endoscope and the ancillary device(s) to be<br>
introduced and guided through a tortuous pathway. In certain exemplary embodiments, the<br>
attachment device(s) can be configured to prevent radial movement, i.e., twisting, of the ancillary<br>
device relative to the endoscope, yet allow axial sliding of the ancillary device relative to the<br>
endoscope. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the term "endoscope" as used herein is<br>
intended to include any endoscopic or laparoscopic viewing apparatus.<br>
-5-<br><br>
[0022] FIG. 1A illustrates one exemplary embodiment of an ancillary attachment device 10 for<br>
attaching one or more ancillary devices to an endoscope. In general, the attachment device 10 is<br>
in the form of an elongate body formed from a plurality of segments 10a, 10b, 10c, l0d, l0e that<br>
are spaced apart from one another along an axis A1 of the attachment device 10. The segments<br>
l0a-c define a pathway 12 formed therethrough for receiving an endoscope and one or more<br>
ancillary devices therein. The shape of the segments l0a-e. and thus the shape of the pathway<br>
12, can vary depending on the configuration of the endoscope and ancillary device(s). In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, each segment l0a-c is ring shaped with first and second terminal ends<br>
(terminal ends 14a, 14b are shown on segment 10a) that overlap to form the ring. Thus, each<br>
segment l0a-e has a substantially circular cross-sectional shape. The inner diameter D1 of the<br>
segments, and thus the pathway 12, can vary depending on the size of the endoscope and<br>
ancillary device(s), as well as the desired strength of the mating connection. For example, the<br>
pathway 12 can have an inner diameter D1 that is less than a maximum outer diameter of the<br>
endoscope and the ancillary device, such a friction fit is formed between the attachment device<br>
10 and the endoscope and ancillary device. The friction fit can be configured to prevent any<br>
movement between the ancillary device and the endoscope. As will be discussed below, other<br>
techniques can be used to facilitate engaging between the attachment device 10 and an<br>
endoscope and ancillary dcvicc(s), and other types of fits can be used such as a slip fit. which<br>
allows the ancillary device to slide relative to the endoscope. A person skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the segments l0a-c can have other cross-sectional shapes such as square, ovular,<br>
rectangular, triangular, etc. The segments l0a-e can also have an open configuration. For<br>
example, the terminal ends of each segment l0a-e can be spaced apart to form a C-shapcd<br>
member. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the attachment device 10 can include<br>
only one segment, such that the device is in the form of a single ring-shaped member.<br>
[0023 ] The particular quantity of segments l0a-e can also vary depending on the desired<br>
portions of an ancillary device to be attached to an endoscope, and the desired strength of the<br>
mating connection between an ancillary device(s) and an endoscope. For example, the<br>
attachment device 10 can include numerous segments such that the device 10 has a length L1 that<br>
is substantially the same as the length of an insertion portion of an endoscope, thus allowing the<br>
ancillary device 10 to be attached to the endoscope along the entire length thereof. Alternatively,<br>
-6-<br><br>
the attachment device l0a-e can include a few segments such that only a portion of an ancillary<br>
device is attached to an endoscope. With such a configuration, multiple attachment devices can<br>
be used and positioned at various locations along the length of an endoscope and an ancillary<br>
device, as will be discussed in more detail below. The size of each segment l0a-c, e.g., the<br>
width, length, thickness etc., can also vary to obtain a desired mating connection between an<br>
ancillary device(s) and an endoscope.<br>
[0024] As noted above, the segments l0a-e can be spaced axially apart from one another, i.e.,<br>
spaced along the axis A1. Such a configuration allows the attachment device 10 to flex axially in<br>
coordination with flexion of the endoscope and ancillary device as the devices are inserted<br>
through a tortuous pathway, as will also be discussed in more detail below.  While various<br>
techniques can be used to mate the segments l0a-e and maintain them in an axial spaced<br>
relationship, FIG. 1A illustrates a cross-connector bar 16 extending axially along the attachment<br>
device 10 and attached to the first end of each segment l0a-e. The cross-connector bar 16 can<br>
also facilitate mating of the attachment device 10 around an endoscope and ancillary device(s),<br>
as the cross-connector bar 16 can be engaged and pulled into an open configuration wherein the<br>
device 10 can be positioned around the endoscope and ancillary device(s).<br>
[0025] FIG. IB illustrates the attachment device 10 in use disposed around an endoscope 20 and<br>
an ancillary device 30 to mate the ancillary device 30 to the endoscope 20. While various<br>
techniques can be used to position attachment device 10 radially around the endoscope 20 and<br>
the ancillary device 30, in an exemplary embodiment the attachment device 10 is expandable. In<br>
particular, the terminal ends of each segment l0a-e can be moved away from one another to form<br>
an axial opening in the attachment device 10. This can be achieved by merely grasping and<br>
pulling the cross-connector bar 16 away from the device 10 to form an opening between the first<br>
and second terminal ends of each segment l0a-e. The attachment device 10 can then be placed<br>
radially around the endoscope 20 and the ancillary device 30 and the terminal ends can move<br>
together to cause the attachment device 10 to engage the endoscope 20 and ancillary device 30<br>
therein. While each segment 10a-e can include a hinge or other joint formed thereon for<br>
allowing the ends to move relative to one another, in an exemplary embodiment the terminal<br>
ends are biased to a closed configuration, as shown in FIGS. 1A and IB. This can be achieved<br>
by forming the attachment device 10, or at least the segments l0a-e of the attachment device 10,<br>
-7-<br><br>
from a flexible material, such as a plastic or metal. A person skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that a material can be selected to produce an attachment device 10 having a desired amount of<br>
strength and flexibility.<br>
[0026] FIG. 2A illustrates another embodiment of an attachment device 100 for removably<br>
attaching one of more ancillary devices to an endoscope. In this embodiment, the attachment<br>
device 100 has a coiled configuration with each successive turn forming a segment 100a-d of the<br>
coil. The coiled attachment device 100 also includes first and second terminal ends 114a, 114b<br>
formed at opposed ends thereof. As noted above, the number of turns or segments, as well as the<br>
amount of spacing between the segments, can be varied to obtain a desired amount of flexibility.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the device 100 has a flexibility that allows a pathway 112<br>
extending through the device to expand to receive an endoscope and one or more ancillary<br>
devices therein, and an inner diameter D3 that allows the device 100 to engage and maintain the<br>
ancillary device(s) in close contact with the endoscope, and more preferably in a substantially<br>
fixed radial position relative to the endoscope.<br>
[0027] FIG. 2B illustrates the device 100 in use disposed around an endoscope 120 and an<br>
ancillary device 130. In order to mate the attachment device 100 to the endoscope 120 and the<br>
ancillary device 130, the first terminal end 114a of the attachment device 100 can be placed<br>
around the endoscope 120 and the ancillary device 130. The attachment device 100 can then be<br>
rotated to rotatably place the attachment device 100 around the endoseopc 120 and ancillary<br>
device 130, thereby mating the ancillary device 130 to the endoscope 120. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the diameter D2 of the pathway 112 is smaller than a maximum diameter of the<br>
endoscope 120 and the ancillary device 130, such that the attachment device 100 is slightly<br>
expanded when it is disposed around the endoscope 120 and the ancillary device 130 to form a<br>
tight mating connection, such as a friction fit or a slip fit, between the devices. As previously<br>
explained with respect to FIGS. 1A and IB, various materials can be used to form an expandable<br>
attachment device.<br>
[0028] In other embodiments, the attachment device can include features to help prevent radial<br>
movement, i.e., twisting, of the ancillary device about the outer perimeter of the endoscope. By<br>
way of non-limiting example, the attachment device can be formed from a non-slip material that<br>
-8-<br><br>
is effective to grip the endoscope and the ancillary device. In another embodiment, a portion of<br>
the attachment device, such as the inner surface of the device, can include a non-slip surface<br>
coating disposed thereon, or can include other surface features, such as gripping teeth or<br>
protrusions, that engage the endoscope and the ancillary device. The engagement features or<br>
coating can also be disposed or formed on only portions of the attachment device to allow the<br>
device to engage the endoscope, yet allow free slidable movement of an ancillary device.<br>
[0029] FIG. 3 A illustrates another embodiment of a technique for preventing radial movement<br>
between an endoscope and an ancillary device. As shown, the attachment device 200 is similar<br>
to the device 100 of FIG. 2A, and has a coiled configuration with successive turns, each of which<br>
forms a segment 200a-e. In this embodiment, however, each segment 200a-e includes a detent<br>
202a-e or protrusion formed therein that defines a groove 204a-e on an inner surface of the<br>
segment 200a-e for seating an ancillary device. The grooves 204a-e of the segments 200a-c are<br>
aligned axially, such that the ancillary tool can extend axially through the pathway 212 and can<br>
sit within each of the grooves 204a-e. In use, as shown in FIG. 313, the grooves 204a-e will<br>
engage the ancillary device 230 and will prevent radial movement of the device 230 relative to<br>
the endoscope 220. Thus, the ancillary device 230 will remain in a substantially fixed radial<br>
position about the endoscope 220. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of<br>
techniques can be used to substantially prevent movement between the attachment device, the<br>
endoscope, and the ancillary dcvice(s).<br>
[0030] While FIGS. IB, 2B, and 3B illustrate a single attachment device disposed around a<br>
distal portion of an endoscope and ancillary device, the various attachment devices disclosed<br>
herein can be disposed around any portion of an endoscope and one or more ancillary devices to<br>
mate the ancillary dcvice(s) to the endoscope at desired mating locations. For example, a kit<br>
containing multiple attachment devices can be provided and they can be positioned a distance<br>
apart from one another at various locations along a length of an endoscope and an ancillary<br>
device, thereby forming various attachment points. Depending on the configuration of each<br>
attachment device, the attachment device(s) can prevent radial movement, i.e., twisting, of the<br>
ancillary device(s) while allowing axial, i.e., sliding, movement of the ancillary dcvice(s) relative<br>
to the endoscope. As a result, the attachment device(s) can allow the ancillary dcvicc(s) to move<br>
in coordination with the endoscope as it is guided through a tortuous pathway.<br>
-9-<br><br>
[0031] One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention<br>
based on the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited by<br>
what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended claims. All<br>
publications and references cited herein are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entirety.<br>
[0032] What is claimed is:<br>
-10-<br><br>
CLAIMS:<br>
1.	An ancillary attachment device, comprising:<br>
a clamp having an axial pathway formed therethrough configured to receive an<br>
endoscope and an ancillary device, the axial pathway being expandable to allow the clamp to<br>
expand to be positioned radially around an endoscope and an ancillary device extending axially<br>
adjacent to the endoscope, and to allow the clamp to close around the endoscope and the<br>
ancillary device to mate and maintain the ancillary device in a substantially fixed position<br>
relative to the endoscope, the clamp including a plurality of segments spaced axially apart from<br>
one another and defining the axial pathway extending therethrough.<br>
2.	The device of claim 1, wherein the clamp has a substantially circular cross-sectional<br>
shape.<br>
3.	The device of claim 1, wherein each segment includes a tool engaging portion adapted to<br>
be disposed radially around and to engage a shaft of an endoscope, and a tool seating portion<br>
adapted to seat an ancillary device therein to attach the ancillary device to the endoscope.<br>
4.	The device of claim 3, wherein the tool engaging portion comprises a ring-shaped<br>
member, and the tool seating portion comprises a protrusion formed in the ring-shaped member<br>
and defining a groove for seating a portion of an ancillary device.<br>
5.	The device of claim 3, wherein the tool seating portion is adapted to maintain an ancillary<br>
device in a fixed radial position relative to an endoscope.<br>
6.	The device of claim 1, wherein each segment includes first and second terminal ends that<br>
overlap to form a circular member, at least one of the terminal ends of each segment being mated<br>
to one another.<br>
7.	The device of claim 1, wherein the clamp comprises a coiled body having a plurality of<br>
successive turns, each turn of the coiled body comprising a segment.<br>
8.	The device of claim 1, further comprising a coating disposed on at least a portion of an<br>
internal surface of the clamp to prevent slippage between the clamp and an endoscope and/or<br>
ancillary device extending therethrough.<br><br>
Methods and devices are provided for attaching one or more ancillary devices to an<br>
endoscope. The ancillary device can be any device that is used in conjunction with endoscopic<br>
procedures, such as, by way of non-limiting example, an accessory channel, tube, or sleeve, an<br>
indwelling tube or feeding tube, and surgical tools such as graspers, snares, etc. The ancillary<br>
device(s) can be positioned adjacent to and along side an external surface of an insertion portion<br>
of an endoscope for inserting into a body lumen, and one or more attachment devices can be used<br>
to mate the ancillary device(s) to the endoscope at one or more attachment locations. In use, the<br>
attachment device(s) will allow the ancillary device to move in coordination with the endoscope,<br>
thus allowing the endoscope and the ancillary device(s) to be introduced and guided through a<br>
tortuous pathway. In certain exemplary embodiments, the attachment device(s) can be<br>
configured to prevent radial movement, i.e., twisting, of the ancillary device relative to the<br>
endoscope, yet allow axial sliding of the ancillary device relative to the endoscope.<br></td>
