Description<br>
Axial rotor section for a rotor of a turbine<br>
The invention relates to an axial rotor section for a rotor of<br>
a turbine, having an outer circumferential surface which is<br>
adjacent to two end first side surfaces, in which rotor blade<br>
holding grooves for rotor blades of the turbine, are<br>
distributed over the circumference and extend in the axial<br>
direction, and having a further circumferential surface which,<br>
radially further inwards, is adjacent to one of the two first<br>
side surfaces, in which further circumferential surface at<br>
least one sealing groove is provided, is open radially<br>
outwards, extends in the circumferential direction and has a<br>
plurality of sealing elements which are inserted therein and at<br>
least partially cover the end openings of the rotor blade<br>
holding grooves.<br>
An axial rotor section of this generic type for a turbine, and<br>
a rotor of this generic type, are disclosed, for example, in<br>
Laid-Open Specification DE 1 963 364. The rotor section is<br>
formed by a rotor disk and is equipped with holding grooves,<br>
which run in the axial direction, for the turbine rotor blades,<br>
with an endlessly circumferential holding groove for sealing<br>
plates being provided at the end. A plurality of projections<br>
are provided on one side wall of the retaining groove, are<br>
distributed uniformly in the circumferential direction and<br>
partially cover the groove base on the retaining groove.<br>
Furthermore, the laid-open specification discloses a sealing<br>
plate in the form of a plate which, adjacent to its inner edge<br>
that is arranged radially inwards, has a thickened area on both<br>
sides which corresponds approximately to the groove width of<br>
the retaining groove. The thickened area is in this case<br>
interrupted in places, viewed in the circumferential direction,<br>
by recesses which are designed with a width that corresponds to<br>
that of the projections of the retaining groove. In<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
consequence, the sealing plate can be inserted into the<br>
retaining groove from the outside by a purely radial movement<br>
and, following a movement in the circumferential direction<br>
which corresponds approximately to the width of the projection,<br>
is hooked thereto. The thickened area of sealing plate then<br>
engages behind the projections on the retaining groove, so that<br>
the sealing plate cannot move outwards. In order to fit all the<br>
sealing plates, they are successively inserted into the<br>
retaining groove and only then can they be moved jointly in the<br>
circumferential direction. This avoids the need for a sealing<br>
plate lock. After insertion and movement of the sealing plates,<br>
the rotor blades are pushed into their grooves. The outer edge<br>
of the sealing plates are then pushed into grooves on the<br>
platform side of the rotor blades so that they are secured<br>
against axial movement. In order to complete the assembly<br>
process, the sealing plates are fixed in a raised position by<br>
means of a screw. Each widened area then rests on the<br>
projection. This arrangement of the components makes it<br>
possible to separate a first area, which is located between the<br>
sealing plate and the end face of the rotor disk, from a second<br>
area, which is located beyond the sealing plate, for guiding<br>
different media. In order to achieve particularly good sealing,<br>
the widened area of the sealing plate rests on that side wall<br>
of the retaining groove on which no projection is provided.<br>
Furthermore, an inner, conically running edge of the projection<br>
ensures that the sealing plate is pressed against that side<br>
wall of the retaining groove which has no projection, by the<br>
influence of centrifugal force.<br>
One disadvantage of the known arrangement is the complex design<br>
of the side surfaces of the rotor disk and of the sealing<br>
plate, with projections and recesses. A further disadvantage is<br>
the use of a screw to secure the sealing plates against<br>
movement in the circumferential direction. Corrosion and<br>
strength problems can occur in the screw connection as a result<br>
of the alternating thermal stress that occurs between operation<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
and shutdown and as a result of the hot gas flowing through the<br>
turbine. In some circumstances, this screw connection cannot be<br>
released correctly. In this situation, the screw is drilled<br>
out, with this process generally also being carried out on the<br>
rotor while it is still located in the lower housing half of<br>
the gas turbine. During this process, it is possible for swarf<br>
to fall into the lower housing half, which can lead to<br>
inadvertent contamination during subsequent operation.<br>
Furthermore, FR 2 524 933 discloses a means for securing rotor<br>
blades against axial movement, with the rotor blades being held<br>
by means of a plate which can move in the circumferential<br>
direction. However, the arrangement disclosed in this document<br>
is not suitable for sealing an area close to the disk from an<br>
area beyond the plate.<br>
Furthermore, laid-open specification DE 30 33 768 Al discloses<br>
a rotor assembly for a rotor disk of a turbine which has an<br>
integral sealing ring in order to secure the rotor blades<br>
axially. However, because of the integral sealing ring, this is<br>
suitable only for aircraft gas turbines since these are formed<br>
by stacks in the axial direction. In contrast, stationary gas<br>
turbines are composed of two housing halves which surround the<br>
completely assembled rotor. The integral sealing ring in DE 3 0<br>
33 768 Al is hooked to the turbine disk in the form of a<br>
bayonet fitting. For this purpose, projections and recesses,<br>
which are distributed along the circumference, are arranged<br>
alternately both on the turbine disk and on the sealing ring.<br>
For assembly, the sealing ring is placed on the rotor disk,<br>
with the recesses and projections opposite one another. These<br>
can then be hooked to one another by slightly twisting the two<br>
parts with respect to one another.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide an axial<br>
rotor section for a stationary turbine and to provide a sealing<br>
element for a turbine rotor which is fitted with rotor blades,<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
with an improvement to the installation and removal of the<br>
sealing elements and rotor blades.<br>
This object is achieved by an axial rotor section having the<br>
features as claimed in claim 1.<br>
The axial rotor section as claimed in the precharacterizing<br>
clause of claim 1 is distinguished in particular in that the<br>
means comprises a securing plate having at least one hole which<br>
is aligned with one of the holes in the side walls of the<br>
sealing groove, such that the bolt which is inserted into the<br>
respectively aligned holes secures the securing plate against<br>
becoming loose.<br>
The invention therefore provides for the bolt which has been<br>
inserted into the holes to secure the securing plate and,<br>
conversely, for the securing plate to secure the bolt, against<br>
becoming loose. This makes it possible to secure the sealing<br>
elements against movement in the circumferential direction in a<br>
manner which allows them to be fitted and removed quickly and<br>
easily. The use of a bolt which is seated in a hole and is<br>
likewise interlocked to each sealing element associated with it<br>
makes it possible to specify a reusable component for securing<br>
the sealing elements. Only the securing plates are designed as<br>
a spare part for single use, thus making it possible to remove<br>
and fit rotor blades and sealing elements at low cost.<br>
Furthermore, the securing plates and bolts can be produced at<br>
low cost.<br>
Advantageous refinements are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
According to a first advantageous development, a securing<br>
groove% is provided in the further circumferential surface and<br>
is adjacent to the sealing groove, and in which the securing<br>
plates are inserted. Although the securing plates can also be<br>
arranged in the sealing groove, both the sealing elements and<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
the securing plates can be placed considerably more easily and<br>
with less effort, however, according to the abovementioned<br>
refinement if a groove intended for this purpose is provided<br>
adjacent to the axial rotor section for each of the two<br>
elements. In the abovementioned case, the hole in which the<br>
bolt is inserted also extends through the side walls of the<br>
securing groove.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to seat the securing plate in<br>
its own securing groove when the securing plate must be<br>
plastically deformed, that is to say bent around, during<br>
fitting. The side walls of the securing groove are particularly<br>
suitable for absorbing the forces which occur during this<br>
process.<br>
The securing plate is preferably in the form of a plate and is<br>
provided with a radial extent in an operating position which is<br>
greater than the depth of the securing groove. In particular,<br>
the securing plate has a radial length such that, after<br>
insertion in the securing groove, it can be bent around the<br>
further circumferential surface until, in the bent-around<br>
state, it at least partially covers the hole which is arranged<br>
in the second side surface and through which the bolt has been<br>
inserted. By way of example, the securing plate may be formed<br>
by two plate limbs. One of the two plate limbs has a hole for<br>
holding the bolt, and the other plate limb is in the form of a<br>
tongue which can slightly cover the hole which is arranged in<br>
the side surface. In consequence, the tongue blocks the opening<br>
of the hole, so that the bolt is blocked. This can then not<br>
slide out of the hole even in response to the vibration which<br>
occurs during operation of the turbine. In order to remove the<br>
bolt, the sealing element and the rotor blade, the tongue<br>
provided on the securing plate just has to be bent back by<br>
means of a flat bar such that the opening of the hole in which<br>
the bolt is seated is released again. The bolt can then be<br>
removed through the opening.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
In another advantageous refinement, one end of the bolt<br>
projects partially out of the hole in the second side surface<br>
so that this end can be connected to the securing plate with an<br>
interlock. By way of example, that end of the bolt which<br>
projects out of the rotor section is provided with at least one<br>
projection behind which the plate limb of the securing plate<br>
which covers the hole can engage. This ensures that the plate<br>
limb of the securing plate is firmly connected to the end of<br>
the bolt, further preventing the securing plates from being<br>
bent up in response to centrifugal force. In this refinement,<br>
the bolt is secured particularly reliably against inadvertently<br>
becoming loose.<br>
The interlock may in this case be designed such that that plate<br>
limb of the securing plate which is connected to the projecting<br>
end of the bolt is forced against the second side surface by<br>
the influence of centrifugal force. A minimum friction force<br>
between the bolt and the securing plate must then be overcome<br>
in order to open the interlock, thus always reliably preventing<br>
the security plate from being bent up inadvertently during<br>
operation of the gas turbine.<br>
In a further refinement of the securing plate, the securing<br>
plate is U-shaped with two freely ending plate limbs, with a<br>
hole for the respective bolt being provided in each of the<br>
plate limbs. The two holes are in this case not located exactly<br>
opposite one another. The U-shape of the securing plate is in<br>
this case designed such that, once it has been inserted into<br>
the sealing groove or securing groove, it can be operated<br>
resiliently in order that the holes in the securing plate as<br>
well as the hole provided in the second side surface can be<br>
moved to align them in order to allow the bolt to be inserted.<br>
The bolt is in this case provided at its end projecting out of<br>
the side surface with an annular groove into which one of the<br>
holes in the securing plate can be snapped. This refinement<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
also allows self-securing attachment of the bolt to be<br>
achieved.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the securing plate, the<br>
hole has an opening in the form of a keyhole with a smaller and<br>
a larger diameter, with the bolt having an external diameter<br>
which is larger than the smaller diameter of the keyhole and<br>
being provided with an endlessly circumferential annular groove<br>
in which the keyhole in the securing plate engages. In order to<br>
fit this securing means, the securing plate is first of all<br>
inserted into the securing groove, and the bolt is then<br>
inserted into the hole provided for this purpose. The securing<br>
plate is then raised outwards so that the smaller diameter of<br>
the keyhole engages in the endlessly circumferential annular<br>
groove on the bolt. The securing plate is then bent around the<br>
raised position in order to fix it in this position in this<br>
way. The outer end of the securing plate then rests on the<br>
further circumferential surface of the rotor section.<br>
The rotor section is expediently formed by a rotor disk which<br>
may be one of the parts of the rotor of a turbine.<br>

refinement of a securing plate, and<br>
Figure 16 shows the securing plate designed as shown in<br>
Figure 15, in the installed state.<br>
Gas turbines and their methods of operation are generally<br>
known. The rotors of gas turbines may, for example, be formed<br>
from a plurality of rotor discs which are located adjacent to<br>
one another and are braced by one central tie rod, or by a<br>
plurality of off-center tie rods. Each rotor therefore<br>
comprises a plurality of rotor sections, each of which may be<br>
formed by a rotor disk.<br>
Figure 1 shows the cross section through the outer area 8 of a<br>
rotor disk 10 according to the invention, which represents an<br>
axial section 12 of the turbine rotor. The rotor disk 10 has a<br>
hub hole, which is not shown, for holding the central tie rod.<br>
The outer area 8 of the rotor disk 10 is formed by two opposite<br>
end first side surfaces 14, which are connected to one another<br>
by a circumferential surface 16. A plurality of rotor blade<br>
holding grooves 18 are distributed uniformly along the<br>
circumference. The section through the rotor disk 10 is in this<br>
case located such that it runs through one of the rotor blade<br>
holding grooves 18 which are provided in the circumferential<br>
surface 16. Each rotor blade holding groove 18, which has a<br>
cross section in the form of a fir tree, extends in the axial<br>
direction of the rotor and is in this case open both radially<br>
outwards and axially at the end. The rotor blade holding groove<br>
18 is intended to hold one rotor blade of the turbine.<br>
In the illustrated example, further circumferential surfaces 22<br>
are provided adjacent to, but radially further inwards than,<br>
the two first side surfaces 14. By way of example, as<br>
illustrated on the left for the rotor disk 10, the<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
circumferential surface 22 may be formed by a step. A sealing<br>
groove 24 which is open radially outwards and extends in the<br>
circumferential direction is provided in the circumferential<br>
surface 22. An endlessly circumferential end projection 28 is<br>
provided in or above the opening 20 of each sealing groove 24<br>
and in each case at least partially covers the opening 2 0 of<br>
the sealing groove 24 in the axial direction, forming an<br>
undercut 30. The projection 28 has a contact surface 31<br>
pointing towards the sealing groove 24.<br>
A likewise endless circumferential securing groove 2 6 is<br>
provided, adjacent to the sealing groove 24, in every other<br>
circumferential surface 22. Securing plates - which will be<br>
described later - are fitted in this securing groove 26 and are<br>
used to secure bolts and sealing elements. Holes 27 are<br>
provided for the bolts, extend in the axial direction of the<br>
rotor and each pass through the side walls of the securing<br>
groove 26 and one of the side walls of the sealing grove 24.<br>
The drilled holes 27 in this case also each extend through<br>
second side surfaces 29 of the rotor disk 10.<br>
Both the sealing groove 24 and the securing groove 26 may also<br>
be formed by projections which project upwards, rather than by<br>
a step, with these projections being provided on a balcony.<br>
This is illustrated on the right-hand side of the rotor disk 10<br>
in Figure 1.<br>
Each sealing groove 24 is intended to hold sealing elements 32,<br>
which are shown in the perspective illustration in Figure 2.<br>
The sealing element 32 comprises an essentially quadrilateral<br>
base body 34 which is in the form of a plate and has a center<br>
area 40 between an inner edge 36, which is provided radially<br>
inwards in an operating position, and an outer edge 38, which<br>
is provided radially outwards in an operating position. The<br>
center area 40 is formed by two side walls 48, 49 which are<br>
essentially at the same constant distance from one another,<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
that is to say the wall thickness of the center area 40 is<br>
essentially constant. The inner edge 3 6 and the outer edge 3 8<br>
are connected to one another via two straight side edges 42.<br>
The inner edge 3 6 has a bead-like widened area 44 with respect<br>
to the center area 40, forming a contact surface 46 which<br>
points outwards. The widened area 44 and the contact surface 46<br>
extend over the entire length of the inner edge 3 6 running in<br>
the circumferential direction, and therefore run without any<br>
interruption between the two side edges 42.<br>
The widened area 44 is in this case provided only on	that side<br>
wall 48 of the sealing element 32 which is opposite	the first<br>
side surface 14 of the rotor section 12 in an	operating<br>
position. On the side wall 49 of the sealing element	32 facing<br>
away from the first side surface 14, the center area	40 merges<br>
into the inner edge 3 6 without any offset.<br>
Furthermore, a plurality of spacers 50 are provided on the<br>
sealing element 32 and are separated from one another both in<br>
the circumferential direction and in the radial direction. In<br>
this case, these are arranged on that side wall 48 of the<br>
sealing element 32 which faces the first side surface 14 of the<br>
rotor section 12.<br>
An overhang 54, which extends transversely with respect to the<br>
radial direction, is provided in the area of the outer edge 3 8<br>
on that side wall 49 of the sealing element 32 which faces away<br>
from the first side surface 14 of the rotor section 12. The<br>
overhang 54 in this case has a sealing tip 56 which runs in the<br>
circumferential direction and points outwards.<br>
Furthermore, the sealing element 32 has a recess 63 for holding<br>
a securing element in the area of the inner edge 36. In this<br>
case, the recess 63 is arranged such that it does not interrupt<br>
the outer contact surface 46 of the widened area 44. The recess<br>
63 is preferably in the form of a blind hole and is arranged<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
only on that side wall 49 which faces away from the first side<br>
surface 14 of the rotor disk 10.<br>
Like Figure 1, Figure 3 shows the cross section through the<br>
outer area of a rotor disk 10, also illustrating a rotor blade<br>
58 arranged in a rotor blade holding groove 18. The rotor blade<br>
58 has a rotor-end foot 55, to which a platform 57 and,<br>
adjacent to it, an aerodynamically profiled blade section 59<br>
are integrally connected.<br>
The foot 55 of the rotor blade 58 has a fir-tree-shaped cross<br>
section and corresponds to the fir-tree shape of the rotor<br>
blade holding groove 18. The schematic illustration of the<br>
contour of the rotor blade foot 55 and that of the rotor blade<br>
holding groove 18 is shown rotated through 90° with respect to<br>
the rest of the illustration in Figure 3. The rotor blade<br>
holding groove 18 illustrated in Figure 3, and as illustrated<br>
more correctly in Figure 1, therefore also extends between the<br>
two first side surfaces 14 of the axial rotor section 12.<br>
Furthermore, head ends 61 of stator blades 60 are indicated<br>
schematically and, considered in the flow direction of the<br>
working medium of the gas turbine, are arranged upstream and<br>
downstream of the rotor blades 58. The guide vanes 60 are in<br>
this case arranged on the form of rays in rings. The stator<br>
blades 60 in each ring are stabilized by an attachment ring 62<br>
provided at the head end. The attachment ring 62 completely<br>
surrounds the rotor 65 of the gas turbine, and is supported by<br>
the stator blades 60, which do not rotate. The attachment ring<br>
62 is in this case arranged in a free space 68 which is located<br>
between the first side surfaces 14 of adjacent rotor discs 10.<br>
The rotor blade 58 is secured against axial movement within the<br>
rotor blade holding groove 18 by means of sealing elements 32<br>
which are inserted into the sealing grooves 24 on both sides of<br>
the rotor disk 10.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
The free space 68 subdivided into two areas 70, 72 by the<br>
sealing element 32. The first area 70 is bounded axially by the<br>
side wall 48 of the sealing element 32 and by the first side<br>
surface 14, opposite the side wall 48, of the rotor section 12.<br>
The second area 72 corresponds to the remaining free space 68,<br>
and is partially bounded by the side wall 49 of the sealing<br>
element 32.<br>
Furthermore, cooling channels 66 for carrying coolant are<br>
provided in the rotor disk 10.<br>
Four different refinements of the invention will be described<br>
in the following text, with identical components in the various<br>
refinements being provided with the same reference numbers.<br>
According to the numbering of the refinement one to four, the<br>
respective reference numbers are also provided with a<br>
corresponding suffix a to d, to identify the refinement.<br>
A pair comprising a securing plate 77 and a bolt 7 6 that is<br>
used for this purpose are described for each refinement.<br>
Figure 4 shows a resilient securing plate 77a according to a<br>
first refinement. The securing plate 77a is U-shaped with two<br>
freely ending plate limbs 79a, 80a, with a hole 81a for the<br>
respective bolt 76a being provided in each of the plate limbs<br>
79a, 80a. The two plate limbs 79a, 80a are connected to one<br>
another via a web 84a, and are positioned at a slight angle to<br>
one another, so that the two holes 81a provided therein are not<br>
aligned with one another.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the two plate limbs 79a, 80a have<br>
different dimensions, differing by the amount Ah. This<br>
dimension also corresponds to the shift between the two holes<br>
81a in the unstressed securing plate 77a.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
The bolt 76a illustrated in Figure 6 can be jointly fitted in<br>
the rotor disk 10 in conjunction with the sealing plate 77a as<br>
shown in Figure 4, in order to secure the sealing element 32.<br>
The bolt 7 6a has an axial extent between two bolt ends 82a,<br>
83a, with the first end 82a being provided with a chamfer 85a,<br>
in order to allow it to be fitted better. The second end 83a is<br>
provided with a circumferential annular groove 87a.<br>
Figure 7 shows a cross section through a detail of the axial<br>
rotor section 12, in which the securing plate 77a as shown in<br>
Figure 4 is fitted with a bolt 76a as shown in Figure 6. A step<br>
is provided in the rotor disk 10, in which the hole 27 that<br>
extends in the axial direction is provided, and ends in a side<br>
wall of the sealing groove 24. For fitting, in addition to the<br>
sealing element 32, the securing plate 77a with its plate limb<br>
79a must additionally be fitted in the sealing groove 24. In<br>
the process, care should be taken to ensure that the hole 27,<br>
the holes 81a and the recess 63 provided in the sealing element<br>
lie on one imaginary axial line. Because of the two holes 81a,<br>
which are offset with respect to one another, in the securing<br>
plate 77a the holes 81a, 27 are on different radii with respect<br>
to the rotor rotation axis. The sealing element 32 which has<br>
been inserted in the sealing groove 24 can then be moved<br>
outwards, that is to say raised. The bolt 76a is then passed<br>
through the hole 81a in the other plate limb 80a, and is then<br>
inserted in the hole 27. In order to make it easier to insert<br>
the bolt 7 6a, an auxiliary force Fassy pointing inwards can act<br>
on the connecting rod 84a of the U-shaped securing plate 77a,<br>
in order to bend it resiliently. The bending of the resilient<br>
securing plate 77a results in all the holes 81a, 27 being moved<br>
to the same radius of the rotor, so that the bolt 7 6a can be<br>
inserted further without any problems. Once the bolt 76a has<br>
reached its operating position as shown in Figure 7, and the<br>
auxiliary force Fassy has been removed, the plate limb 7 9a of<br>
the securing plate 77 can spring back into the annular groove<br>
87 provided on the bolt 76a, so that the bolt 76a is secured<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
against radial movement owing to the interlock between the<br>
annular groove 87a and the plate limb 79a. The securing plate<br>
77a is itself held by the bolt 76a.<br>
This even prevents centrifugal forces that occur during<br>
operation from being able to release the bolt 76a from its<br>
interlock. On the contrary, the centrifugal force acting on the<br>
sealing plate 77a prevents the interlock between the bolt 76a<br>
and the securing plate 77a from being released.<br>
In order to remove the first sealing element 77a, as shown in<br>
Figure 4, this just has to be elastically deformed by a force<br>
Fassy directed radially inwards, until the interlock between the<br>
securing plate 77a and the bolt 76a is released in the area of<br>
the annular groove 87a. The bolt 76a can then be removed from<br>
the hole 27, followed by the securing plate 77a and the sealing<br>
element 32. It is, of course, also possible to fit the security<br>
plate 77a in the securing groove 26.<br>
A second refinement of the securing plate 77b is illustrated in<br>
Figure 8. The sealing element, which is formed essentially from<br>
two plate limbs 79b, 80b arranged at right angles to one<br>
another before fitting, has only one hole 81b in one of the two<br>
plate limbs 79b. The other of the two plate limbs 80a is<br>
tapered, and is therefore in the form of a tongue. The bolt 76b<br>
to be used for this securing element 77b is shown in a<br>
perspective illustration in Figure 9. This is also provided<br>
with a chamfer 85b at its first end 82b. At its opposite end<br>
83b, the bolt 76b is just cylindrical and, at the end, has a<br>
blind hole 89b with a thread for an extractor.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the fitting of the securing plate<br>
77b and the bolt 76b. In contrast to the first refinement shown<br>
in Figure 7, the step which is provided to form the sealing<br>
groove 24 is slotted in the circumferential direction, by which<br>
means the securing groove 26 is formed. The securing groove 26<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
is intended to hold the securing plate 77b as shown in<br>
Figure 8. For fitting, that plate limb 79b of the securing<br>
plate 77b in which the hole 81b is provided inserted into the<br>
securing groove 26. In the process, care must be taken to<br>
ensure that the hole 81b is aligned with the hole 27. The<br>
sealing element 32 which has been inserted into the sealing<br>
groove 24 is then raised so that its recess 63 is opposite the<br>
hole 27. The bolt 76b is then pushed into the hole 27 and<br>
through the hole 81b until the first end 82b of the bolt 76b<br>
engages in the recess 69 in the sealing plate 32. The bolt 76b<br>
is preferably pushed in until its second end 83b is completely-<br>
recessed in the hole 27. The second plate limb 80b is then bent<br>
radially inward by application of a fitting force F pointing<br>
radially inwards, until the previously free limb 80 covers the<br>
end opening of the hole 27, and blocks the bolt 76b against<br>
movement along the hole 27 (Figure 11). In order to ensure that<br>
the plate limb 79b, which is provided with the hole 81b, is<br>
held securely during the plastic deformation of the tongue-like<br>
plate limb 80b, the securing plate 77b is not, in contrast to<br>
the solution shown in Figure 7, also inserted in the sealing<br>
groove 24, but in the securing groove 26. The side walls of the<br>
securing groove 2 6 are used as an opposing bearing for the<br>
bending process. In order to remove the securing plate 77b for<br>
the bolt 76b and for the sealing element 32, the plate limb<br>
79b, which blocks the hole 127 just has to be bent up by means<br>
of a flat bar. The bolt 76b can then be removed from the hole<br>
27, resulting in the sealing element 32 becoming accessible.<br>
A third refinement of a securing plate 77c and of the bolt 76c<br>
is illustrated in perspective form in Figures 12 and 13 and in<br>
the installed state in Figure 14, with the reference symbols of<br>
known elements now being provided with the suffix c.<br>
The securing plate 77c shown in Figure 12 and its fitting are<br>
essentially identical to those from Figure 8. In the<br>
illustration in Figure 12, it is shown in the state in which it<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
has already been bent around. However, this differs in its free<br>
plate limb 80c, which must be bent around in order to fit and<br>
to secure the bolt 76. This plate limb 80c first of all extends<br>
like a tongue, starting from the first plate limb 79c, and then<br>
ends with a broadened hammerhead 91c. The bolt 76c is likewise<br>
slightly modified in comparison to the bolt 76b. Instead of the<br>
blind hole 89b at the end, two projections 93c are provided on<br>
the bolt 7 6c, and are at a distance from one another. In this<br>
case, in the fitted state, the gap which is formed by the two<br>
projections 93c holds the tongue-like section of the securing<br>
plate 77c, and the hammerhead 91c on the securing plate 77c<br>
engages behind the two projections 93c, as is illustrated in<br>
Figure 14.<br>
The projections 93c also have inclined surfaces 95c, which are<br>
provided for contact with the hammerhead 91c. In this case, the<br>
surfaces 95c are inclined such that the securing plate 77c,<br>
which tries to move outwards under the influence of centrifugal<br>
force Fz, is hooked to the bolt 7 6c in such a way that the<br>
plate limb 80c, which is bent around during fitting, is moved<br>
towards the side surface and towards the rotor disk 10 as a<br>
result of the inclination of the projections 93c. The bolt 76c<br>
and the associated securing plate 77c are in this case<br>
preferably designed such that a minimum friction force between<br>
the bolt 76c and the securing plate 77c must be overcome in<br>
order to open the interlock between the hammerhead 91c and the<br>
projection 93c. This allows the securing plate 77c and the bolt<br>
76c to be fitted particularly securely and reliably.<br>
Figures 15 and 16 illustrate a fourth and final refinement of a<br>
securing plate 77. The securing plate 77d is essentially in the<br>
form of a plate and has an opening in the form of a keyhole<br>
with a smaller diameter and a larger diameter. The bolt 7 6d to<br>
be used with this securing plate 77d requires only one annular<br>
groove 87d, which is positioned when the bolt 76d is fitted in<br>
such a way that it is in the area of the securing groove 26. In<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
order to fit the bolt 76d and the securing plate 77b, the last-<br>
mentioned must first of all be inserted into the securing<br>
groove 26. In this case, care must be taken to ensure that the<br>
holes 81d in the securing plate 77d are aligned with the hole<br>
27 that is located in the rotor disk. The bolt 76d can then be<br>
inserted into the hole 27 and can be moved in depth into it<br>
until its annular groove 87d is located in the securing groove<br>
26. The securing plate 77d can then be raised so that its<br>
smaller diameter engages in the annular groove 87d, and blocks<br>
the bolt against axial movement. The securing plate 77d, which<br>
is still flat, is then bent around so that the section which<br>
projects from the securing groove 26 comes to rest on the<br>
circumference of the rotor disk 10 (Figure 16).<br>
Overall, the invention makes it possible to specify an axial<br>
rotor section 12 for a rotor of a turbine in which a sealing<br>
element 32 which is provided on an end side surface 14 is<br>
secured against movement in the circumferential direction by<br>
means of a bolt 76, with the bolt 76 being secured reliably by<br>
means of a securing plate 77 against becoming loose. One<br>
particular advantage of the invention is the comparatively<br>
simple and cost-effective design comprising a securing plate<br>
77, a bolt 76, holes and grooves 24, 26. Furthermore, these<br>
components can be fitted and removed quickly because of their<br>
simple geometry.<br><br>
