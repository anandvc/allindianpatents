This  Invention relates to a device for use  with an a-c earth leakage circuit breaker provided with a d.c. load.<br>
Circuit breakers which are used for a.c. loads for tripping the circuit and cutting off power supply, whenever an earth leakage-current occurs, as a result of a fault, including human electrocution taking place, are usually termed ELCB (earth leakage circuit breaker) or RCCB (residual current circuit breaker)• The ELCB or RCCB type of circuit breakers are highly sensitive and react rapidly to trip the circuit whenever current— leakage occurs either in the a.c. load or In the power supply 1Ines and thus in cases of human beings being subject to electric shock 1ives are saved by the sensitivity and rapidi ty in action of these circuit breakers-<br>
The circuit breakers, ELCB or RCCB type, however, have this drawback, namely, that they do not react to a d.c current-leakage fault occurring tn a d-c. load connected to an a.c. power supply through a rectifier. For instance, a television set which requires  a d.c- power supply for operation has  a<br><br>
built-in rectifier which is connected to an a.c. power supply. Now, if the known ELCB or RCCB is connected in the power mupply circuit, while it will operate in the event of a.c- leakage occurring, it will not react in the event of . d.c. leakage occurring at the d.c, load as, for instance, in the case of some one being electrocuted by d.c. This is so because the known ELCB or RCCB, by very nature of its construction, i« unable to react to d.c   leakage-<br>
The term "circuit breaker" or earth break circuid breaker<br>
 in this specification is intended to mean and include circuit breakers of the ELCB or RCCB type refferred to above and other like circuit breakers-<br>
Having regard to the foregoing drawback of the<br>
known circuit breaker, it i© an object ai this<br>
invention to propose a device which when connected<br>
to such circuit breaker, render© the same not only<br>
operable    (in   the   known   way)   for	a.c.<br>
leakage, but also operable, in accordance wi th this invention,  for d.c. leakage.<br>
In  the  known circuit breaker a  toroidal  core current balance transformer (CBT) is provided  and<br><br>
the phase and neutral lines of the power supply are passed through the core of the CBT and theae 1ines form the primary of the CBT, A winding provided on and around the core itself forms the secondary of the CBT,<br>
In the known circult breaker, occurrence of  a.c imbalance  (corresponding to a.c. earth  leakage) is  sensed  by  the CBT and this  results  in  the tripping of the power supply.<br>
However, when there is a d-c- load included in the load circuit, a d.c- earth leakage fault producing<br>
-t<br>
a pulsating d.c- does not result in the tripping. It is only if the device proposed herein is incorporated in the circuit of the known circuit breaker that the tripping circuit will be activated even in the case of a d.c. earth leakage occurring, because the said device senses the d.c. earth leakage and creates an a-c. Imbalance to which the known circuit breaker reacts.<br>
Various other features.  of this invention wl 11 be apparent  from the following  further  description<br>
thereof given hereunder.<br><br>
According to this invention, the device for use with an a.c circuit breaker provided for a d.c-load, comprises a current balance sensor provided for the phase and neutral line© of the a-c. power source, for sensing the pulsating d.c-. earth leakage at the said load; a control unit incorporating a trigger circuit acting as an electronic switch, the trigger circuit for being connected to the said sensor, such that on a d.c. earth leakage occurring at the said load, the d.c. imbalance is sensed by the sensor to actuate the trigger circuit to close and create an a.c-imbalance in the said lines and thus trip the said circuit breaker.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate,  by way of example,<br>
in  Fig. I  an embodiment of the  proposed  device connected  to  the circuit of  the  known  circuit breaker (single phase power supply)<br>
in Fig.2 an embodiment of the proposed device connected  to  the circuit of  the  known  circuit<br><br>
breaker (three  phase power supply)<br>
in Fi9.3 the asaembly of the device (single phase power supply)<br>
In Fig.4 the assembly of the device (three phase power supply)<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, the embodiment comprises a sensor coil  S (CBT) whose output terminals T T are connected to the input of the eltctronic trigger circuit F comprised in the control unit A. The trigger circuit acts as an electronic switch in the normally open state-<br>
The d.c- load is indicated by L.<br>
As soon as a d.c earth leakage occurs at the d-c. load L. a pulsating d.c- is reflected in the phase line P of the power supply lines* This pulsating d.c. is sensed by the CBT . Since the CBT is connected to the trigger circuit, the normally  open switch is triggered to close-<br>
The terminals D D of the switch F are connected to the phase and neutral lines P N of the power supply  at E E (or to phase and earth) such  that.<br><br>
on the said switch closing, the points E E are short-circuited to create an a.c. imbalance in the said lines. The known circuit breaker B then react© to the a.c imbalance in the known way to trip the circuit and cut off power supply to the load.<br>
To avoid a dead short between points E E the trigger F comprises a current limiting impedance, to limit the current to safe values*<br>
In the, embodiment discussed, the said swi tch comprises  a BCR switching circuit.<br>
In  the  embodiment i1lustrated,  as  an  optional feature,  the   control  unit  comprises  an over voltage   monitoring  circuit  connected  to   the trigger  circuit such that whenever over  voltage conditions occur, the sensor actuates the trigger circuit  to trip the circuit breaker  and  protect the connected load.<br>
The trigger circuit has setting means for setting the operative level of the said circuit to values of earth leakage above a predetermined value, so that   where   the  earth   leakaop   current.   <br><br>
negligible, tripping in   avoided.<br>
An advantage of the device proposed herein is that where the circuit breaker is already on the market or with the user, the device proposed herein can be connected thereto in the manner described hereinabove, to entend its operation to d-c. loads as well<br>
Alternatively,  the device can	be made a  part	of<br>
the  known  circuit  breaker,	at  the  stage	of<br>
manufacture  Itself.   In such	a  case,  only	one<br>
current balance sensor will be	required.<br>
The  terms and expressions in  th is  specification are  of  description and not of  limitation,  this invention  not  being limited to  the  embodiment described and illustrated by way of example,  but it is understood that various other embodiments of the  device proposed herein are possible  without departing  from  the  scope and      ambit  of  this invention.<br><br><br><br>
