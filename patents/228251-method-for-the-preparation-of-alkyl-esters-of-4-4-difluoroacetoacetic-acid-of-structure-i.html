				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to method for the preparation of alkyl esters of 4,4-difluoroacetoacetic acid of structure (I).<br>
The present invention relates to a new method for the preparation of alkyl esters of 4,4-difluoroaceto-acetic acid (alkyl esters of 4,4-difluoro-3-oxobutanoic acid) from alkyl esters of 4-chloro-4,4-di-fluoroacetoacetic acid that are in turn obtained from alkyl esters of 2-chlorodifluoroacetic acid.<br>
It is already known that ethyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetate can be obtained by the reaction of ethyl difluoroacetate with ethyl acetate in the presence of sodium hydride (cf. Tetrahedron 2001, 57, 2689-2700). However, the yield from this reaction of 25 % is very unsatisfactory. In addition ethyl acetoacetate obtained as byproduct is difficult to separate from the desired product.<br>
It is also known that ethyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetic acid can be prepared by the reaction of ethyl difluoroacetic acid with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of zinc (cf. Tetrahedron 1996, 52, 119-130). However the yields of this reaction also leave much to be desired.<br>
Moreover, a common disadvantage of both of the cited methods is that ethyl difluoroacetate used is very expensive and is thus unattractive as educt for large scale industrial production.<br>
It is also known that a chlorodifluoroacetyl group as substituent of an aromatic can be reduced with sodium-formaldehyde sulphoxylate dihydrate (cf. Tetrahedron Lett. 2001, 42, 4811-4814). However, this reaction cannot be transferred to ethyl 4-chloro-4,4-difluoroacetoacetate.<br>
The task of the present invention is thus to make available a new, economic method with which alkyl esters of 4,4-difluoroacetoacetic acid can be obtained in a high overall yield and in high purity.<br>
Thus the subject matter of the present invention is a method for the preparation of alkyl esters of 4,4-difluoroacetoacetic acid of structure (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R stands for alkyl, characterised in that<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which R stands for alkyl,<br>
characterised in thai<br>
a) in a firstitep alkyl esters of 4-chloro-4,4-difluoroacetoacetic acid of structure (II)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which R has the meaning described above<br>
are reacted with trialkylphosphites of the structure (III)<br>
P(OR1)3 (m)<br>
in which<br>
R1 stands for C1-C4-alkyl, whereby the residues R1 can in each case be the same or<br>
different,<br>
the alkyl phosphonates of structure (IV) thus obtained<br>
O-R<br>
in which R and R1 have the meanings described above<br>
are reacted in a second step with an amine of structure (V)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R2 and R3 independently of each other stand for hydrogen or C1-C8-alkyl or together for<br>
-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-S-CH2-CH2- or -CH2-CH2-N(R4)-CH2-CH2-,<br>
R4 stands for hydrogen or C1-C8-alkyl,<br>
optionally in the presence of a diluent,<br>
and the enarnines of structure (VI) thus obtained<br>
O-R<br>
in which R, R and R have the meanings described above<br>
is hydrolysed in a third_step in the presence of an acid.<br>
Surprisingly the alkylphosphonates of structure (IV) cannot be transformed directly into the desired<br>
final product by acid hydrolysis, rather decomposition is observed under these conditions. Equally<br>
surprising is that in the second step of the method of the invention the desired alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetate<br>
and the corresponding phosphonamide are not obtained from the alkyl phosphonate of<br>
structure (IV) and an amine of structure (V), but the enamine of structure (VI) and the ammonium salt<br>
of the phosphoric acid diester. This enamine is surprisingly readily transformed into the 4,4-difluoroacetoacetatc<br>
of structure (I) by acid hydrolysis. For this isolation of the enamine is not at all<br>
necessary.<br>
The method of the invention thus overcomes the disadvantages of known preparation procedures<br>
described above and gives alkyl esters of 4,4-difIuoroacetoacetic acid in high yield and high purity. In<br>
addition the method has the advantage that esters of acetoacetic acid which can be present as impurity<br>
in alkyl esters of 4 chloro-4-difluoroacetoacetate of structure (II) can be readily removed from the<br>
reaction mixture. During the conversion esters of acetoacetic acid do not react with trialkylphosphites<br>
of structure (III) and can be removed from the alkyl phosphonates of structure (IV) by distillation.<br>
Starting from ethyl 4-chloro-4,4-difluoroacetoacetate, trimethyl phosphite and diisoproplylamine the<br>
method of the invention can be illustrated by the following reaction scheme.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetates obtainable by the method of the invention can also exist in the<br>
enol form as well as the keto form shown in structure (I):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In addition to the alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetates the hydrates of the compounds are also obtained by<br>
the method of the invention:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Thus the respective hydrate is also understood to be product of the method of the invention as well as<br>
the alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetates (in keto and enol form). Depending upon the subsequent chemistry<br>
either all three forms of the product can be reacted further or respectively only certain forms (cf.<br>
below).<br>
The alkyl 4 -chloro-4,4-difliioroacetoacetates of structure (II) used as starting material in the first step<br>
(a) of the invention are known (cf. Journal of Fluorine Chemistry 1992, 56, 271-284; Huaxue Xuebao<br>
1282, 41, 729-729 and Chemical Abstracts 1384, 100. Abstract No. 22308; EP-A 0 082 252). The<br>
may be prepared, for example, in that<br>

temperature.<br>
The reaction time is not critical and can be selected within a large range depending upon the size of<br>
the batch. Generally the reactants are brought together over a period of up to 150 min, preferably up<br>
to 120 min, more preferably up to 90 min. The time for further reaction is usually 3 hours with<br>
cooling overnight (i.e. in ca. 16 hours).<br>
Work up is carried out by normal methods. In the first step of method (a) of the invention firstly<br>

min to 30 min and allowed to react for several hours preferably for up to 24 hours, more preferably<br>
up to 20 hours.<br>
Work up is carried out by normal methods. In the third step the reaction mixture is usually extracted<br>
with a suitable solvent, washed with sodium chloride solution and sodium hydrogen carbonate<br>
solution, the crude product is dried and evaporated under reduced pressure. The alkyl 4,4-<br>
difluoroacetoacetates of stnicture (I) are then freed of further impurities by distillation.<br>

alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, for example petroleum ether, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane,<br>
methylcyclohexane. benzene, toluene, xylene, decalin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or dichloromethane;<br>
ethers, e.&amp;. diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-tert-amyl ether,<br>
dioxan, tetrahydroluran, 1,2-dirnethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane or anisole; nitriles, e.g. acetonitrile,<br>
propionitrik:, n~ or iso-butyronitrile or benzonitrile; amides, e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetarnide, N-methylformanilide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoramide;<br>

The reaction time is not critical and a wide range can be selected depending on the size of the batch.<br>
In general the reactants are mixed over a period of a few minutes up to 180 min, preferably between<br>
10 min to 90 min and allowed to react for several hours preferably for up to 24 hours, more<br>
preferably for up to 16 hours.<br>
Work up is carried out by normal methods. Usually the reaction mixture is neutralised, the phases are<br>
separated, washed with sodium chloride solution, the crude product is dried and evaporated under<br>
reduced pressure. The alky I 4-chloro-difluoroacetoacetates of structure (II) are then freed of further<br>
impurities hy distillation.<br>
In carrying out method (b) of the invention in general between 0.5 mol and 5 mol, preferably between<br>
1 mol arid 5 mol, more preferably between 1 mol and 2.5 mol alkyl acetate of structure (VIII) are used<br>
for 1 mol alkyl chlorodifluoroacetate of structure (VII).<br>
All steps of the methods (a) and (b) of the invention are normally carried out at normal pressures. It is<br>
possible, however, to carry out individual or all steps under high or reduced pressure - generally<br>
between 0.1 and 50 bar, preferably between 1 bar and 10 bar.<br>
The alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetates obtainable by method (a) of the invention are valuable<br>
intermediates lor the preparation of difluoromethyl-substituted pyrazolylcarboxylic acid and<br>
thiazolylcarboxylic acid derivatives that are in turn precursors for compounds with antifungal activity<br>
(cf. e.g. WO 02/08197 and DE-A 102 15 292).<br>
For example, alkyl 4,4~difluoroacetoacetates can be first converted into alkyl 2-(difluoracetyl)-3-<br>
alkoxy acrylates in high yields (over 90 % with the ethyl ester, cf. preparation examples) with acetic<br>
anhydride and trialkyl orthoformates. Cyclisation with methyl hydrazine gives l-methyl-3-<br>
difluoromethyl-pyra/oIe-4-carboxylic acid (in the case of the ethyl ester in a yield of over 65 %). The<br>
wrong isorner (I methyl-5-difluoromethyl-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) can be separated by<br>
crystallisation. The conversion can be illustrated by the following reaction scheme:<br>
(H3C-CO)20 H2N-NHCH3 p C COH 2<br>
reflux I M EtOH<br>
F F *\ -R I<br>
(I) O OL<br>
Also the alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetates can be first chlorinated when the mono- and dichlorinated<br>
products (alkyl 2,2-dichloro-4,4-difluoro-3-oxobutanoate and alkyl 2-chloro-4,4-difluoro-3-oxobutanoate)<br>
are obtained, both of which can be reacted almost quantitatively with thioacetamide to form<br>
ilkyl 3-inethyl-4-dittiion methylthiazole-5-carboxylates (cf. following scheme):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The preparation according to the invention of alkyl 4,4-difluoroacetoacetates as well as their use for<br>
the preparation of difluoromethyl-substituted heterocycles is discussed in the following examples that<br>
illustrate further the above description. However, the examples are not to be interpreted in a limiting<br>
manner.<br>
Preparation examples<br>
Example I:<br>
Step 1:<br>
Preparation of ethyl 3-[(dimemoxyphosphoryl)oxy]-4,4-difluorobut-3-enoate (IV-1)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Trimethylphosphite (232.0 g, 1.87 mol) is added dropwise over 90 min to ethyl 4-chloro-4,4-difluoroacetoacetate<br>
(305,1 g, content 77.0%, 1.17mol) at 25Â°C to 30Â°C with ice cooling and gas<br>
generation. Stirring is first continued for 1 h at 30Â°C, then for 3 h at 40Â°C to 45Â°C. For work up the<br>
reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature (ca. 16 h) and evaporated under reduced pressure. The<br>
crude product is purified further by distillation.<br>
302.0 g (97%, 91 % of theory) ethyl 3-[(dimethoxyphosphoryl)oxy]-4,4-difluorobut-3-enoate (boiling<br>
point 92-95Â°C at 0.4 hPa) are obtained.<br>
Step 2:<br>
Preparation of ethyj. 3-(diisopropylamino-4,4-difluorobut-3-enoate (VI-1)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Diisopropylamine (15.2g, 0.15 mol) is added dropwise over 10 min to a solution of ethyl 3-<br>
|(dimethoxyphosphoryI)oxy]-4,4-difluorobut-3-enoate (IV-1) (14.2 g, 97%, 0.05 mol) in 100ml<br>
methyl-tert-butyl ether. After 19 h heating under reflux the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature,<br>
washed twice with 10 ml 10% sodium chloride solution each time, dried over sodium sulphate,<br>
