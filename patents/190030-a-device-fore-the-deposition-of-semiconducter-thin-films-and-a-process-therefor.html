				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device  for the deposition of  semiconductor thin films and a process therefor. The device of the present invention is particularly useful for depositing ultra thin film compound semiconductor materials by low cost techniques having a fast growth rate, These films should have uniform edge to edge thickness with acceptable electrical, structural and optical   properties   for   the   production  of   opto-electronic  devices.<br>
Categorically the methodologies of thin film deposition can be either (a) Physical deposition techniques (b) Chemical deposition techniques. It is well known that the former involves capital intensive infrastructure and hence is not suitable for utilisation in low cost thin film devices. The second category involves mainly three possible methods, (i) Electrochemical (ii) Solution growth or chemical bath deposition and (iii) Spray pyrolysis techniques, which are all low cost propositions. However, the methods (i) and (ii) suffer from the difficulty that these  are   essentially   slow  deposition  processes.<br>
The   history  of   spray   pyrolysis   can  be   traced  back  as   early  as 1910     when     transparent   conducting  oxides   was  achieved     by     spray pyrolysis     of      SnCl4   solution,   as   reported   by     Foex,      Bull,      Soc, ChÂ£m.   Fr   11,   6(1944),    in  his   review.   The   extension  of   this     technique   to   sulphide  and  selenide   films   took   place   in   the   1960's     by R.R.      Chamber I in,   WBAFB  Contract  No,   AF331657-7919      (1962),      J.E.<br>

Hill   &amp;  R.R,   Chamber 1 in,   U.S.   Patent  3,    148,064   (1964),   R,R,   Cham-berlin  fc.  J.S,   Skarman,   J.   Electrochem,   Sbc.    113,   86   (1966),      J,S.<br>

Spray    pyrolysis   (SP)   involves  spraying  a  solution,   usually aqueous,   containing   soluble   salts  of   the   constituent  atoms  of     the desired  compound  on  to  a  heated  substrate.   Droplets   reaching     the hot     substrate  undergoes   pyrolytic     (endothermic)     decomposition and     forms  a  single   crystallite  or   a  cluster   of     crystallites     of the     products.   The  other   volatile  by-products  and  excess     solvent escape     as   vapour.   The   substrate  provides   the   thermal   energy     for the     thermal      decomposition  and   subsequent   recombination     of     the constituent   species,   followed  by  sintering  and   re-crystallisation of   the   clusters   of   crystallites.   The   result   is  a  coherent     film. The     chemical   solution   is  atomised   into  a   spray   of   fine     droplets by  a   spray  nozzle  with   the   help  of   a  carrier   gas   which  may  or   may not   play  an  active   role   in   the  pyrolytic   reaction   involved,<br>
A block diagram of a typical spray pyrolysis set up is shown in Fig.1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The various parts are (1) Carrier gas, (2) Gas flow meter (3) Filtered solution reservoir (4) Solution flow control (5) Spray gun (6) Substrate, (7) Substrate heater (8) Radiation heater (9) Exhaust (10) Radiation shield gas enclosure (11) Thermocouple, The filtered carrier gas and solution are fed into a spray nozzle at a predetermined constant pressure and flow rate. The substrates are placed on the top of a heater over which the sprayed   droplets   strike   in   the   form  of   a   vertical   cone,    from     the<br>
tip of the spray nozzle. Large area uniform coverage of the<br>
substrate        may       be       obtained       by       employing	semiautomatic<br>
arrangements. The set-up is generally enclosed in a chamber provided with an exhaust duct to remove the vaporised constituents  and   to   provide  a  stable   flow   pattern.<br>
There are two recent approaches which has modified the aforesaid technique, M.E, Doty and T.V, Bernitsky, U.S. Patent 4, 659, 247 (1957), P.V, Meyers, Polycrystal 1 ine CdTe n-.i-p Solar Cells, SERl/STR-221-3519 DE 39009437, prepared under sub contract No. ZL-7-06031-2, This is the narrow-gap inverted reactor design which utilises gravity sorting of heavier droplets. However, the substrates in these two processes are kept directly in contact with the heater banks, (as in the standard SP technique) thereby a   possibility  of   contamination  of   the   film  cannot   be   ruled  out.<br>
The atomisation process and the growth kinetics have been studied in detail by several workers viz. A, Banerjee, Ph.D. Thesis, I IT Delhi (1973), A, Banerjee, S,R. Das, A,P. Thakoor, H.S. Randhawa and K.L. Chopra, Solid State Electronics, 22, 495 (1979) and E. Shanthi, V, Dutta, A. Banerjee and K.L. Chopra, J. Appl. Phys., 51, 6243 (1950), They have found that the deposition process is the net result of (a) spreading of a drop into a disc, (b) pyrolytic reaction between the decomposed reactants, (c) evaporation of the solvent and (d) repetition of the preceding process with succeeding drop rates. Consequently, the film generally contains overlapping discs, each disc corresponding to a single  droplet,<br>
THE  DEFECTS/DRAWBACKS  OF  PRIOR  ART  DEVICES  &amp;  PROCESSES   ARE<br>
1.	In the standard spray technique the solution droplets directly hit the substrates resulting in two processes of heat transfer : (a) heat required for the chemicals to undergo the reaction, (b) heat taken up by the solvent to go to the gaseous state. These two heat loss mechanisms from the substrate surface may cause thermal shock to the glass substrates resulting in possible   cracks.<br>
2.	Since the substrates are in direct contact with the heater and the heater is exposed to the reacting chemicals there is a possible chance of contamination of the deposited films from the heater.<br>
3,	The sprayed solutions form a conical shape while depositing<br>
on the substrates due to which, the outer edges of the deposited<br>
films are likely to be thinner. Although the technology involved<br>
in references M.E, Doty and T.V. Bernitsky, U.S. Patent 4, 689,<br>
247 (1987) and P.V, Meyers, Polycrystalline CdTe n-i-p Solar<br>
Cells, SERI/STR-221-3519 DE 89009437, prepared under sub contract<br>
No. ZL-7-06031-2 do not conform to the conical shape of the<br>
sprayed solution, non-uniformity in the film edges have also,been<br>
reported  as   drawback   by   these   authors.<br>
4,	The films are grown by the overlapping of several discs,<br>
hence, there is a high probability that voids are likely to occur<br>
in between. Hence ultra thin films with long range continuity<br>
cannot   be   obtained   by   this   process.<br>
The     object     of   the  present   invention   is   to     provide  a  device useful      for   the   deposition   of   thin   films   and   a   process      therefor.<br>
in the device &amp; process of the present invention the droplets/mist are first vaporized in a preheated zone. The vapour thus formed inside a vertical glass tube condenses in thin film form on the substrate. As a result, there is no possibility of droplets directly reaching the substrate. Therefore, the growth kinetics of the overlapping discs does not arise in this case.<br>
Figs.2(a) &amp; 2(b) accompanying this specification represent the device of the present invention useful for the growing of thin semiconductor films.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for the deposition of semiconductor thin films which comprises an open ended cylindrical reactor chamber (1), the said chamber being held vertically by clamps (11 &amp; 12), characterized in that a cylindrical furnace (2) being provided at middle periphery of the said chamber, the said chamber being provided with a spray gun (3) passing through sealed cap (13) fitted to its bottom, the said spray gun being connected through a tube (4) to a funnel (5) containing a reactant solution, the said spray gun being also connected to another tube (14) which delivers the carrier gas through a rotameter (9), the top of the said chamber being provided with a thermo-couple (6) and a holder (7) for holding a substrate (8), temperature indicator (10) being connected to the said thermocouple (6).<br>
The thermocouple passes through a hole drilled in the graphite strip. The graphite substrate holder is clamped at a position very close to the upper end of the tube furnace. The   mist/droplets   while   passing through the heated portion of the<br>
reactor tube get converted to the vapour state. This vapour, then travels vertically upward and strikes the substrate surface. The necessary pyrolysis reaction is accomplished on the substrate surface to generate the desired film. The residual byproduct passes   out  as   gas   through  an  exhaust   outlet.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the deposition of semiconductor thin films which comprises placing a substrate above the central heating zone of the reactor chamber, maintaining the temperature of the substrate in the range of 350-400Â°C, vapour spraying the substrate with a reactant solution using an inert gas at a flow rate in the range of 4 to 6 Iitres/min.<br>
Deposition  of   thin  films  of  CdS<br>
A spray solution containing CdCl2(0.01M) and thiourea (0.011M) dissolved in methanol is taken in the separating funnel. The liquid is allowed to pass through the tube by opening the stopcock (15). A certain height of the tube is completely filled with the solution and maintained constant throughout the deposition time. This helps 'to maintain a constant rate of flow of the solution. Nitrogen gas coming through the rotameter into the spray gun forces the solution vertically upwards inside the reactor tube in the form of a mist. The substrate on which the film is to be coated is kept at a temperature around 360o-400Â°C, which is approximately 1.5 inch away from the central heating zone.      The   temperature  of   the  central   heating   zone   is  about     50Â°C<br>
more than the substrate temperature. Several process parameters are important for uniform film deposition. These are, a) the distance separating the tip of the spray nozzle from the lower end of the tube furnace, b) length of the heated section of the reactor tube inside the tube furnace, c) temperature of the central heating zone, d) gas flow rate, e) height of the liquid in   the   polythene   tube.<br>
For a typical CdS film deposition the following specifications with respect to the aforesaid parameters are important   :-<br>
a)	Distance   separating   the   tip  of   the   spray  nozzle   from   the lower   end   of   the   tube   furnace   :   2   inches.<br>
b)	Length   of   the   heated   zone   of   the   reactor   tube:   4   inches.<br>
c)	Temperature   of   the   central   heating   zone;   430-450Â°C.<br>
d)	Gas   flow   rate:      4   to   6   litres/minute.<br>
e)	Height   of   the   liquid   in   the   polythene   tube:   4.5   inches.<br>
A uniform CdS film thickness in the range of 500 to 1000 Angstrom can be deposited within 10 to 15 minutes by maintaining the  above   parameters.<br>
ADVANTAGES   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
1,	In     the   present   invention,    the   deposition     is     carried     out<br>
against   the   force  of   gravity  of   sorting  out   the   heavier   droplets.<br>
2,	The   sprayed  droplets   are   converted   to   the   vapour   state   in     a<br>
preheated     zone     in  between   the   spray  nozzle  and     the     substrate.<br>
Thus,      the   droplets   do  not   strike   the   substrate   directly  as   in     all<br>
other   spray  deposition   techniques.   This   prevents   the  mechanism  of<br>
film     growth  by  overlapping  discs.   The   resulting   vapour     passing<br>
through   the   vertical   reactor   tube   strikes   the   substrate  uniformly<br>
to   generate  a  unif orm f i Im   thickness   from  edge   to  edge,<br>
3,	In this process the chemical reaction occurs inside the glass reactor tube, a section of which is surrounded from outside by a small tube furnace to raise the required temperature. Thus, the question of contamination of the film by the heater does not arise at all. This is a very important parameter for growing high purity   thin   film   semiconductors.<br>
4,	The thermodynamics of heat exchanges in this process are also different from all other spray techniques, where the glass substrates are subjected to thermal shock, as described earlier. In this technique, no heat loss from the glass substrates occurs for   conversion  of   the   droplets/mist   to   the   gaseous   form.<br>
5,	This technique enables the growth of ultra thin films of uniform thickness, since film formation does not occur through overlapping  discs.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
