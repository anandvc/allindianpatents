Novel Sesquiterpene Synthases and Methods of Their Use<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel terpene synthases. The invention further<br>
relates to nucleic acids encoding terpene synthases, to methods for preparing variant<br>
terpene synthases, and to host-organisms expressing the polypeptides of the invention.<br>
The present invention further comprises methods for making a terpene synthase and<br>
methods for making terpenoids.<br>
Technical Background and Problems to be Solved<br>
Terpenoids or terpenes represent a family of natural products found in most<br>
organisms (bacteria, fungi, animal, plants). Terpenoids are made up of five carbon units<br>
called isoprcne units. They can be classified by the number of isoprene units present in<br>
their structure: monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), triterpenes<br>
(C30), tetraterpenes (C40) and polyterpenes (Cn, n≥45). The plant kingdom contains the<br>
highest diversity of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.<br>
The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most structurally diverse<br>
isoprenoids. They are usually volatile compounds and are mostly found in plants were<br>
they play a role in defense against pathogens and herbivores attacks, in pollinator<br>
attraction and in plant-plant communication.<br>
Some plants, known as aromatic plants or essential-oil-plants, accumulate large<br>
amounts of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in their leaves, roots or stems. Classical<br>
examples of such plants are members from the plant families Lamiaceae, Rutaceae,<br>
Solanaceae, and Poaceae, for example.<br>
Monoterpene and sesquiterpene accumulating plants have been of interest for<br>
thousands of years because of their flavor and fragrance properties and their cosmetic,<br>
medicinal and anti-microbial effects. The terpenes accumulated in the plants can be<br>
extracted by different means such as steam distillation that produces the so-called<br>
essential oil containing the concentrated terpenes. Such natural plant extracts are<br>
important components for the flavor and perfumery industry.<br>
Many sesquiterpene compounds are used in perfumery. For example, Vetivcr oil,<br>
extracted from the roots of Vetiver zizonoides, is known to contain a number of odorant<br>
sesquiterpenes, amongst which α-vetivone, β-vetivone and zizanoic acid, are the most<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
2<br>
characteristic. Vetiver zizanoides is currently cultivated in Reunion, the Philippines,<br>
Comoro Islands, Japan, West Africa and South America.<br>
Generally, the price and availability of plant natural extracts such as Vetiver oil is<br>
dependent on the abundance, the oil yield and the geographical origin of the plants. In<br>
some years, the availability of commercially available natural extracts decreases, going<br>
hand in hand with a worsening of their quality. Under these circumstances, the use of<br>
these ingredients in high quality perfumery products is no longer possible.<br>
Therefore, it would be an advantage to provide a source of sesquiterpenes, which<br>
is less subjected to fluctuations in availability and quality. Chemical synthesis would<br>
seem to be an evident option for the preparation of sesquiterpenes, however, these<br>
compounds generally have a highly complex structure and so far no economic synthetic<br>
process for the preparation of sesquiterpenes has been developed.<br>
It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide ways of producing a<br>
high quality of sesquiterpenes in an economic and reliable way.<br>
The biosynthesis of terpenes in plants has been extensively studied and is not<br>
further detailed in here, but reference is made to Dewick P, Nat. Prod. Rep., 2002, 19,<br>
181 -222, which reviews the state of the art of terpene biosynthetic pathways.<br>
The sesquiterpene synthases convert FPP to the different sesquiterpene skeletons.<br>
Over 300 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and 3000 sesquiterpenoids have been identified<br>
(Joulain, D., and Konig, W.A. The Atlas of Spectral Data of Sesquiterpene Hydrocarbons,<br>
EB Verlag, Hamburg, 1998; Connolly, J.D., Hill R.A. Dictionary of Terpenoids, Vol 1,<br>
Chapman and Hall (publisher), 1991), and many new structures are identified each year.<br>
There is virtually an infinity of sesquiterpene synthases present in the plant kingdom, all<br>
using the same substrate but having different product profiles.<br>
A cDNA encoding a trans-a-bisabolene synthase has been reported by Bohlmann,<br>
J, Crock, J., Jetter, R., and Croteau R. (1998) Terpenoid-based defenses in conifers:<br>
cDNA cloning, characterization, and functional expression of wound-inducible (E)-a-<br>
bisabolene synthase from grand fir (Abies grandis). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 6756-<br>
6761. However, this enzyme catalyses one cyclation step and produces almost exclusively<br>
the bisabolene sesquiterpene.<br>
Kollner T et al (2004) The plant cell 16(5), 1115-1131, disclose a number of<br>
putative terpene synthase genes isolated from Zea mays, most of which did not encode<br>
functional enzymes. DNA sequences of functional synthases, Tps4-B73 and Tps5-1<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
3<br>
delprim are available under accession number AY518310 and AY518313. Bergamotene<br>
was only a minor product produced by the encoded enzymes, representing maximally<br>
2.6wt.% of the total sesquiterpenes produced.<br>
Despite extensive chemical studies of terpene cyclisation, the isolation of the<br>
enzymes is difficult, particularly in plants, due to their low abundance, often transient<br>
expression patterns, and complexity of purifying them from the mixtures of resins and<br>
phenolic compounds in tissues where they are expressed.<br>
In view of the above, the objective of the present invention is to provide new<br>
terpene synthases. Another objective is to isolate terpene synthases from the plant<br>
Vetiveria zxzanoides. It is an objective of the present invention to provide terpene syntascs<br>
capable of synthetizing terpenes for the synthesis of which so far no enzyme has been<br>
reported.<br>
In particular, it is an objective to provide enzymes capable of synthesising<br>
substantial amounts of sesquiterpenes having a santalene or bergamotene carbon skeleton.<br>
There is no report of the genetic basis underlying a santalene synthase, and bergamotane<br>
is synthcsised only in trace amounts by known terpene synthases.<br>
In the same line, it is an objective to provide methods for making terpenoids in an<br>
economic way, as indicated above. Accordingly, the present invention has the objective to<br>
produce sesquiterpenes while having little waste, a more energy and resource efficient<br>
process and while reducing dependency on fossil fuels. It is a further objective to provide<br>
enzymes capable of synthesizing terpenoids, which arc useful as perfumery and/or aroma<br>
ingredients.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Remarkably, the present inventors cloned cDNAs encoding novel sesquiterpenes<br>
in roots of Vetiver zitanoides. Surprisingly, the novel sesquiterpene synthases were<br>
capable of synthetising sesquiterpenes, which have so far not been isolated from Vetiver,<br>
such as cyclocopacamphene, (+)-epi-β-santalene, trans-α-bergamotene, cis-a-<br>
bergamotene, β-bisabolene, and/or trans-y-bisabolene. Therefore, the present invention<br>
provides the first cloned sesquiterpene synthases able to catalyse the cyclisation of FPP to<br>
the bisabolyl cation and subsequent cyclization to the bergamotane and santalane<br>
skeleton. For the first time, a terpene cyclase capable of synthesizing substantial amounts<br>
of bi-cyclic derivatives of the bisabolyl cation is reported.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides isolated nucleic acids encoding novel<br>
sesquiterpene synthases capable of synthesising mono-, bi- and/or tricyclic<br>
sesquiterpenes. Bicyclic or tricyclic sesquiterpenes comprising a C3-C7 bond are defined<br>
as sesquiterpenes having a santalene carbon skeleton, while those comprising a C2-C7<br>
bond are defined as sesquiterpenes of the bergamotene skeleton.<br>
A "terpene" is an hydrocarbon based on an isoprene unit (C5H8), which may be<br>
acyclic or cyclic. "Terpenes" include but are not limited to cyclosativene,<br>
cyclocopacamphene, cyclocopacamphenol epimers, cyclocopacamphenal epimers,<br>
cyclocopacamphenic acid epimers, cis-α-bergamotene, trans-α-bergamotene, (+)-epi-<br>
β-santalene, β-bisabolene, and trans-γ-bisabolene.<br>
"Terpenes" and "Terpenoids", as used herein include terpenes and terpene<br>
derivatives, including compounds that have undergone one or more steps of<br>
functionalisation such as hydroxylations, isomerizations, oxido-reductions, dimethylation<br>
or acylation. As used herein, a "sesquiterpene" is a terpene based on a C15 structure and<br>
includes sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene derivatives, including compounds that have<br>
undergone one or more steps of functionalization.<br>
As used herein, a "derivative" is any compound obtained from a known or<br>
hypothetical compound and containing essential elements of the parent substance.<br>
As used herein, a "terpene synthase" is any enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of<br>
a terpene. A "sesquiterpene synthase" is an enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of a<br>
sesquiterpene.<br>
Sequence identity, as used in the term "identity" or "identical" can be readily<br>
calculated by standard alignment algorithms. Preferably, for assessing sequence identity<br>
of the sequences of the present invention with another sequence, for example from the<br>
prior art, CLUSTAL W. is used, as disclosed in J. D. Thompson , D. J. Higgins, T. J.<br>
Gibson (1994) CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence<br>

alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix<br>
choice. Nucleic Acids Res 22(22), 4673-4680. The standard parameters are selected for<br>
assessing sequence identity. The sequence comparison may be performed on-line, at<br>
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/, or, alternatively, suitable software can be down-loaded.<br>
For example, the BioEdit software available from<br>
http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html.<br>
In an aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acids hybridising to<br>
any of the nucleic acids of the invention, such as those detailed under SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or<br>
3 under low stringency conditions. Preferably, the defined conditions are moderate<br>
stringency conditions, more preferably they are high stringency conditions.<br>
Surprisingly, the sequence at the N-term end of SEQ ID NO 6 differs from other<br>
known terpene synthase sequences in that it contains an unusual motif PAAAASSQQQQ<br>
(SEQ ID NO 7) that does not resemble to any known signal sequence. The present<br>
invention is also directed to this particular sequence, and to any nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding this motif, such as the one of SEQ ID NO 3.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the invention relates to certain isolated nucleotide<br>
sequences including those that are substantially free from contaminating endogenous<br>
material. The terms "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid molecule" include<br>
deoxyribomicleotide or ribonucleotide polymers in either single-or double-stranded form<br>
(DNA and/or RNA). A "nucleotide sequence" also refers to a polynucleotide molecule or<br>
oligonucleolide molecule in the form of a separate fragment or as a component of a larger<br>
nucleic acid.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a nucleic acid selected from:<br>
(a) any nucleic acid selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 and 3, (b) any<br>
nucleic acid selected from the group consisting of the nucleic acids encoding any of the<br>
polypeptides substantially as set out in SEQ ID NO: 4, 5, and 6, (c) a nucleic acid that<br>
hybridises to the nucleic acid of (a) or (b) under low stringency conditions, wherein the<br>
polypeptide encoded by said nucleic acid has sesquiterpene synthase activity.<br>
In an embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence, which is at<br>
least 59%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 65% and most preferably at<br>
least 70% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1. For example, the nucleic acid sequence of the<br>
invention is at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
9<br>
In an embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence, which is at<br>
least 82.4%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at<br>
least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 2. For example, the nucleic acid sequence of the<br>
invention is at least 95%, 97%, or 98% identical to SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
In an embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence, which is at<br>
least 49%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 55% and most preferably at<br>
least 60% identical to SEQ ID NO: 3. For example, the nucleic acid sequence of the<br>
invention is at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% identical to SEQ ID<br>
NO: 3.<br>
Preferably, the nucleic acid of step (c) hybridises under moderate, more preferably<br>
under high stringency conditions to the nucleic acids of (a) or (b) above, but preferably to<br>
the sequence SEQ ID NO 1, 2, or 3. For example, the nucleic acid of (c) hybridised to<br>
SEQ ID NO 1. According to another example, it hybridised to SEQ ID NO 3 under the<br>
above-mentioned conditions.<br>
Preferably, the nucleic acids of the invention hybridise with the nucleic acid of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 and do not hybridise with a nucleic acid encoding a putative scsquitcrpenc<br>
synthase found in Oryza sativa under accession number AP003911.<br>
According to an embodiment, the nucleic acids of the invention hybridises with<br>
the nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO: 2 and do not hybridise with nucleic acids selected from<br>
those having accession numbers AY518310 or AY518313 encoding sesquiterpene<br>
synthases in Zea mays. Preferably, the nucleic acid of the present invention does further<br>
not hybridise with any of the nucleic acid sequences selected from those having accession<br>

As used herein, the term "hybridization or hybridizes under certain conditions" are<br>
defined as disclosed below. The conditions may be such that sequences, which are at least<br>
about 70%, such as at least about 80%, and such as at least about 85-90% identical,<br>
remain bound to each other.<br>
Appropriate hybridization conditions can be selected by those skilled in the art<br>
with minimal experimentation as exemplified in Ausubcl et al. (1995), Current Protocols<br>
in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, sections 2, 4, and 6. Additionally, stringency<br>
conditions are described in Sambrook et al. (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11.<br>
As used herein, defined conditions of "low stringency" are as follows. Filters<br>
containing DNA are pretreated for 6 h at 40°C. in a solution containing 35% formamide,<br>
5x SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7,5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and<br>
500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations are carried out in the same<br>
solution with the following modifications: 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA,<br>
100μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate, and 5-20x106 32P-labclcd<br>
probe is used.<br>
Filters are incubated in hybridization mixture for 18-20 h at 40°C, and then<br>
washed for 1.5 h at 55°C in a solution containing 2x SSC, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),<br>
5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and<br>
incubated an additional 1.5 h at 60°C. Filters are blotted dry and exposed for<br>
autoradiography.<br>
As used herein, defined conditions of "moderate" stringency are different from<br>
those of "low" stringency conditions in that filters containing DNA are pretreated for 7 h<br>
at 50°C (moderate) and 8 hours at 65°C (high) in the corresponding solution given above.<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
11<br>
Hybridizations are carried out in the same solution as for "low stringency" but for 30 h at<br>
50°C, respectively and then washed for 1.5 h at 55°C (moderate) in the washing solution<br>
detailed above. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and incubated an<br>
additional 1.5 h at 60°C.<br>
Conditions for "high" stringency: prehybridization for 8h at 65°C in solution as<br>
above, but with 6xSSC, a nM EDTA, 0.02%PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02%BSA and<br>
500ng/ml denatures salmon sperm DNA instead. Filters are hybridized for 48 h at 65°C in<br>
the prehybridization mixture containing 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and<br>
5-20x106 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Washing of filters is done at 37°C for 1 h in a<br>
solution containing 2x SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0,01% BSA. This is followed<br>
by a wash in 0.1xSSC at 50°C for 45 min. Other conditions of low, moderate, and high<br>
stringency well known in the art (e.g., as employed for cross-species hybridizations) may<br>
be used if the above conditions arc inappropriate.<br>
The present invention also encompasses "variant nucleotide sequences", obtained<br>
by mutations in of any of SEQ ID NO 1, 2, and 3, for example. Mutations may be any<br>
kind of mutations of the sequences of the present invention, such as point mutations,<br>
deletion mutations, insertion mutations and/or frame shift mutations. Variant nucleotide<br>
sequences may be prepared in order to adapt a sequence to a specific expression system.<br>
For example, bacterial expression systems are known to more efficiently express<br>
polypeptides if amino acids are encoded with a preferred codon. Due to the degeneracy of<br>
the genetic code, wherein more than one codon can encode the same arnino acid, multiple<br>
DNA sequences can code for the same polypcptidc, which are encompassed by the<br>
nucleic acids or nucleotide sequences of the present invention.<br>
In addition, the present invention also encompasses variant nucleotide sequences<br>
encoding polypeptides which are substantially different from the amino acid sequences<br>
reported herein, but which are obtained by modifying, e.g. by mutagenesis, or otherwise<br>
taking use of the present nucleotide sequences.<br>

As used herein, the term "poly peptides" refers to a genus of polypeptide or peptide<br>
fragments that encompass the amino acid sequences identified herein, as well as smaller<br>
fragments.<br>
A "polypeptide variant" as referred to herein means a polypeptide substantially<br>
homologous to a native polypeptide, but which has an amino acid sequence different from<br>
that encoded by any of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention because of one or more<br>
detections, insertions or substitutions.<br>
The polypeptide, and polypeptide variants of the present invention preferably have<br>
terpene synthase activity. More preferably, they have sesquiterpene synthase activity.<br>
Variants can comprise conservatively substituted sequences, meaning that a given<br>
amino acid residue is replaced by a residue having similar physiochemical characteristics.<br>
Examples of conservative substitutions include substitution of one aliphatic residue for<br>
another, such as He, Val, Leu, or Ala for one another, or substitutions of one polar residue<br>
for another, such as between Lys and Arg; Glu and Asp; or Gin and Asn. See Zubay,<br>
Biochemistry, Addison-Wesley Pub. Co., (1983). The effects of such substitutions can be<br>
calculated using substitution score matrices such a PAM-120, PAM-200, and PAM-250<br>
as discussed in Altschul, (J. Mol. Biol. 219:555-65, 1991). Other such conservative<br>
substitutions, for example, substitutions of entire regions having similar hydrophobicity<br>
characteristics, are well known.<br>
Naturally occurring peptide variants are also encompassed by the invention.<br>
Examples of such variants are proteins that result from alternate mRNA splicing events or<br>
from proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptides described herein. Variations attributable to<br>
proteolysis include, for example, differences in the N- or C-termini upon expression in<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
16<br>
different types of host cells, due to proteolytic removal of one or more terminal amino<br>
acids from the polypeptides encoded by the sequences of the invention.<br>
Variants of the sesquiterpenes synthases of the invention may be used to attain<br>
desired enhanced or reduced enzymatic activity, modified regiochemistry or<br>
stereochemistry, or altered substrate utilization or product distribution. Furthermore,<br>
variants may be prepared to have at least one modified property, for example an increased<br>
affinity for the substrate, an improved specificity for the production of one or more<br>
desired compounds, a different product distribution, a different enzymatic activity, an<br>
increase of the velocity of the enzyme reaction, a higher activity or stability in a specific<br>
environment (pH, temperature, solvent, etc), or an improved expression level in a desired<br>
expression system. A variant or site direct mutant may be made by any method known in<br>
the art. As stated above, the invention provides recombinant and non-recombinant,<br>
isolated and purified polypeptides, such as from Vetiver plants. Variants and derivatives<br>
of native polypeptides can be obtained by isolating naturally-occurring variants, or the<br>
nucleotide sequence of variants, of other or same plant lines or species, or by artificially<br>
programming mutations of nucleotide sequences coding for native terpenc synthases.<br>
Alterations of the native amino acid sequence can be accomplished by any of a number of<br>
conventional methods.<br>
Polypeptide variants resulting from a fusion of additional peptide sequences at the<br>
amino and carboxyl terminal ends of the polypeptides of the invention can be used to<br>
enhance expression of the polypeptides, aid in the purification of the protein or improve<br>
the enzymatic activity of the polypeptide in a desired environment or expression system.<br>
Such additional peptide sequences may be signal peptides, for example. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention encompasses variants of the polypeptides of the invention, such as those<br>
obtained by fusion with other oligo-or polypeptides and/or polypeptides which arc linked<br>
to signal peptides.<br>
Therefore, in an embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
preparing a variant polypeptide having a desired terpene synthase activity, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) selecting any of the nucleic acids from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 1, 2 or 3,<br>
or nucleic acids therewith related therewith comprising nucleotide sequences<br>
described above;<br>
(b) modifying the selected nucleic acid to obtain at least one mutant nucleic acid;<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
17<br>
(c) transforming host cells with the mutant nucleic acid sequence to express a<br>
polypeptide encoded by the mutant nucleic acid sequence;<br>
(d) screening the polypeptide for a functional polypeptide having at least one modified<br>
property; and,<br>
(e) optionally, if the polypeptide has no desired variant terpene synthase activity, repeat<br>
the process steps (a) to (d) until a polypeptide with a desired variant terpene<br>
synthase activity is obtained (= DNA shuffling).<br>
The method for providing a variant polypeptide is suitable of screening and<br>
functional polypeptides having a desirable property, such as activity parameter, from<br>
polypeptides encoded by a pool of mutant nucleic acids. In step (a), any of the nucleic<br>
acids of the present invention may be selected.<br>
Thereafter, in step (b), a large number of mutant nucleic acid sequences may be<br>
created, for example by random mutagenesis, site-specific mutagenesis, or DNA<br>
shuffling. The detailed procedures of gene shuffling are found in Stemmer, W.P. (1994)<br>
DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: in vitro recombination for<br>
molecular evolution. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 91(22): 10747-1075. In short, DNA<br>
shuffling refers to a process of random recombination of known sequences in vitro,<br>
involving at least two nucleic acids selected for recombination. For example mutations<br>
can be introduced at particular loci by synthesizing oligonucleotides containing a mutant<br>
sequence, flanked by restriction sites enabling ligation to fragments of the native<br>
sequence. Following ligation, the resulting reconstructed sequence encodes an analog<br>
having the desired amino acid insertion, substitution, or deletion. Alternatively,<br>
oligonuclcotidc-dircctcd site-specific mutagenesis procedures can be employed to provide<br>
an altered gene wherein predetermined codons can be altered by substitution, deletion or<br>
insertion.<br>
Accordingly, any of SEQ ID NO 1, 2 or 3 may be recombined with a different<br>
sequence selected from any of SEQ ID NO 1, 2 or 3, and/or with other terpene synthase<br>
encoding nucleic acids, for example isolated from an organism other than Vetiver<br>
zizanoides. Thus, mutant nucleic acids may be obtained and separated, which may be<br>
used for transforming a host cells according to standard procedures, for example such as<br>
disclosed in the present examples.<br>
In step (d), the polypeptide obtained in step (e) is screened for a modified<br>
property, for example a desired modified enzymatic activity. Examples, for desired<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
18<br>
enzymatic activities for which an expressed polypeptide may be screened include<br>
enhanced or reduced enzymatic activity, as measured by KM or Vmax value, for example,<br>
modified regio-chemistry or stereochemistry, altered substrate utilization or product<br>
distribution. The screening of enzymatic activity can be performed according to<br>
procedures familiar to the skilled person and those disclosed in the present examples.<br>
Step (e) provides for repetition of process steps (a)-(d), which may, preferably,<br>
performed in parallel. Accordingly, by creating a significant number of mutant nucleic<br>
acids, many host cells may be transformed with different mutant nucleic acids at the same<br>
time, allowing for the subsequent screening of a elevated number of polypeptides. The<br>
chances of obtaining a desired variant polypeptide may thus be increased at the discretion<br>
of the skilled person.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preparing a nucleic<br>
acid encoding a variant polypeptide having terpene synthase activity, the method<br>
comprising the steps (a)-(e) disclosed above and further comprising the step of:<br>
(f) if a polypeptide having desired variant terpene activity was identified,<br>
acquiring the mutant nucleic acid obtained in step (c), which was used to transform host<br>
cells to express the variant terpene synthase following staps (c) and (d).<br>
Polypeptide variants also include polypeptides having a specific minimal sequence<br>
identity with any of the polypeplides comprising the amino acid sequences according to<br>
SEQ ID NO: 4, 5, and/or 6.<br>
In an embodiment, the isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence<br>

95% and more preferably 97% of sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 6.<br>
Preferably, the polypeptide essentially consists of an amino acid sequence<br>
according to SEQ ID NO: 4, 5 or 6.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a vector comprising the nucleic acid of<br>
the invention.<br>
A "vector" as used herein includes any recombinant vector including but not<br>
limited to viral vectors, bacteriophages and plasmids. The skilled person is capable of<br>
selecting a suitable vector according to the expression system. In one embodiment, the<br>
expression vectors include a cDNA sequence encoding the polypeptide operably linked to<br>
regulatory sequences such as transcriptional promoters, operators, or enhancers, mRNA<br>
ribosomal binding sites, and appropriate sequences which control transcription and<br>
translation initiation and termination for example. Nucleotide sequences are "operably<br>
linked" when the regulatory sequence functionally relates to the cDNA sequence of the<br>
invention.<br>
The vectors of the present invention may be used in the methods for preparing a<br>
genetically modified host organisms and/or cells, in host organisms and/or cells<br>
harbouring the nucleic acids of the invention and in the methods for producing or making<br>
terpene synthases, as is set out further below.<br>
In an aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a terpene<br>

For example, the method of producing a terpene synthase comprises the steps of<br>

Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a recombinant host<br>

organism may be a unicellular or a multi-cellular organism, but is non-human. The host<br>
may be a cell of a multicellular organism, for example. Preferably, the host organism is a<br>
bacterium, for example E. coli. Preferably, the host organism heterologously comprises a<br>
nucleic acid of the invention.<br>
Further preferred host organisms include fungi, preferably yeasts, most preferably<br>
Sacharomyces cerevisiae. Suitable host organisms for expression of polypeptides of the<br>
invention include higher eukaryotic cells, preferably plants. Preferably, the plant is a<br>
species belonging to the family of the Solanaceae or Lamiaceac, more preferably the<br>
genus of Nicotiana. For example, the suitable host cell is a plant cell.<br>
In an aspect, the present invention provides a recombinant host organism or cell<br>
expressing the polypeptide of the present invention. Preferably, the host organism is<br>
transformed to express the polypeptide in a higher quantity than in the same organism not<br>
so transformed.<br>
The term "transformed" refers to the fact that the host was subjected to genetic<br>
engineering to comprise one, two or more copies of any of the nucleic acids of the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably, the term "transformed" relates to hosts heterologuously expressing<br>
polypeptides of the invention and/or encoded by nucleic acids of the invention.<br>
Accordingly, in an embodiment, the present invention provides a transformed<br>
organism in which the polypeptide of the invention is expressed in a higher quantity than<br>
in the same organism not so transformed.<br>
There are several methods known in the art for the creation of transgenic,<br>
recombinant host organisms or cells such as plants, yeasts, bacteria, or cell cultures of<br>
higher eukaryotic organisms. For example, appropriate cloning and expression vectors for<br>
use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described, for<br>

plants, modifying host organisms or cells to harbour transgenic nucleic acids, such as<br>
those of the present invention, are familiar to the skilled person. For the creation of<br>
transgenic plants, for example, current methods include: electroporation of plant<br>
protoplasts, liposome-mediated transformation, agrobacterium-mediated transformation,<br>
polyethylene-glycol-medialed transformation, particle bombardement, microinjection of<br>
plant cells, and transformation using viruses.<br>
In one embodiment, transformed DNA is integrated into a chromosome of a non-<br>
human host organism and/or cell such that a stable recombinant systems results. Any<br>
chromosomal integration method known in the art may be used in the practice of the<br>
invention, including but not limited to, recombinase-mediated cassette exchange<br>
(RMCE), viral site-specific chromosomal insertion, adenovirus, and pronuclear injection.<br>
In a still further aspect, the present invention provides processes and/or methods<br>
for making terpenoids.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of making at least one<br>
terpenoid comprising:<br>
(a) cuntacting at least one acyclic pyrophosphate lerpene precursor with, at least one<br>
polypeptide of the invention or encoded by any of the nucleic acids of the invention,<br>
and,<br>
(b) optionally, isolating at least one terpenoid produced in step (a).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a method of making at least one<br>
terpenoid comprising:<br>
cultivating a non-human organism transformed to express or increasingly express<br>
the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid of any of claims 1 - 3 or the polypeptide of<br>
claim 4 under conditions conducive to the production of terpenoids, and,<br>
optionally, isolating at least one terpenoid from the non-human organism.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the method further comprises the step of:<br>
transforming a non-human organism with a recombinant nucleic acid to express or<br>
increasingly express the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid of any of claims 1-3 or<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
22<br>
the polypeptide of claim 4, before the step of cultivating said organism under conditions<br>
conducive to the production of terpenoids.<br>
Preferably, the at least one terpenoid is the terpenoid disclosed in the present<br>
description. More preferably, the methods are suitable to make at least one cyclic terpene<br>
according to formulae (I) to (VII).<br>
The method of making at least one terpenoid comprises the step of contacting at<br>
least one acyclic pyrophosphate terpene precursor with at least one polypeptide of the<br>
invention. For example, polypeptides as obtained in the above methods for producing<br>
terpene synthases may be used. Such polypeptides may be extracted from host organisms<br>
expressing the nucleic acids of the invention according to standard protein or enzyme<br>
extraction technologies. If the host organism is a unicellular organism or cell releasing the<br>
polypeptide of the invention into the culture medium, the polypeptide may simply be<br>
collected from the culture medium, for example by centrifugation, optionally followed by<br>
washing steps and resuspension in suitable buffer solutions.<br>
If the host organism is a plant or a unicellular organism or cell accumulating the<br>
polypeptide of the invention within the cell, the polypeptide may be obtained by<br>
disruption or lysis of the cells and extracting the polypeptide from the cell lysate.<br>
The isolated polypeptide may then suspended in a buffer solution at optimal pH<br>
and temperature. If adequate, salts, BSA and other kinds of enzymatic co-factors may be<br>
added in order to optimise enzyme activity.<br>
The terpene precursor may be added to polypeptide suspension or solution,<br>
followed by incubation at optimal temperature, for example 30°C. After incubation, the<br>
terpenoid compound may be isolated from the incubated solution by standard isolation<br>
procedures, such as solvent extraction and distillation, preferably after removal of<br>
polypeptides from the solution.<br>
In a step of the process for making at least one terpenoid compound, the host<br>
organism or cell is cultivated under conditions conducive to the production of terpenoids.<br>
Accordingly, if the host is a transgenic plant, optimal growing conditions are provided,<br>
such as optimal light, water and nutient conditions, for example. If the host is a<br>
unicellular organism, conditions conducive to the production of the terpenoid may<br>
comprise addition of suitable cofactors to the culture medium of the host. In addition, a<br>
culture medium may be selected which proves to maximize terpenoid synthesis. External<br>

factors such as optimised pH and temperature are usually also conducive to terpenoid<br>
production in a given expression system.<br>
All the publications mentioned in this application are incorporated by reference to<br>
disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the<br>
publications are cited.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention without limiting<br>
the scope as a result.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Vetiver roots material, isolation of mRNA and cDNA synthesis<br>
Vetiveria zizanoides (Vetiver) plants were obtained from a plant nurseries ('La<br>
Compagnie des Plantes Australes', Les Avirons, The Reunion Island, France). The plants<br>
were cultivated in pots in a green house at the Lullier Agronomy research Station<br>
(Switzerland) and were propagated vegetatively by dividing six months to one-year-old<br>
clumps. In the greenhouse conditions, transplanted vetiver cuttings start sprouting after<br>
one to three weeks and the roots volume is generally tripled or quadrupled after one-year<br>
cultivation.<br>
For harvesting of the roots, the plants were dug out from the pots and rinsed with<br>
tap water. The sesquiterpene content of the roots was evaluated as follows: the roots were<br>
cut in small pieces or crushed in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and extracted<br>
with diethyl ether or pentane; after concentration, the extracts were analyzed by GC and<br>
GC-MS. Plants obtained after transplantation of splits from a mother plant were harvested<br>
at different growing stages: from plants with actively expending root system (4 to 6<br>
months after transplantation) to plants with a well-developed dense root system (1 to 2<br>
years after transplantation). Sesquiterpenes characteristic of vetiver oil were found in all<br>
roots analysed and zizanoic acid was the major constituent.<br>
For the cloning experiments, young plants, obtained approximately 6 month after<br>
transplantation, were used. The roots were cut off from the leaves and frozen in liquid<br>
nitrogen. They were first roughly chopped in liquid nitrogen using a Waring Blendor and<br>
then grounded to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA were extracted<br>
using the Concert™ Plant RNA Reagent from In vitro gen following the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. The concentration of RNA was estimated from the OD at 260 nm and the<br>
integrity of the RNA was evaluated on an agarose gel by verifying the integrity of the<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
24<br>
ribosomal RNA bands. The mRNA were purified from the total RNA by oligodT-<br>
cellulose affinity chromatography using the FastTrack® 2.0 mRNA isolation Kit<br>
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the mRNA<br>
was estimated from the OD at 260 nm and an aliquot was deposited on an agarose gel to<br>
verify the size distribution of the mRNA pool.<br>
Adaptor ligated double stranded cDNA was prepared from the 1 μg of mRNA<br>
using the Marathon™ cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's<br>
protocol. An aliquot of the cDNA library was deposited on an agarose gel to evaluate the<br>
quantity and size distribution.<br>
Example 2<br>
Isolation of fragments of cDNA encoding for sesquiterpene synthases from vetiver<br>
roots<br>
Fragments of cDNA encoding for sesquiterpene synthases were amplified using<br>
degenerated primers specific for plant sesquiterpene synthases nucleotidic sequences.<br>
Sesquiterpene-synthase-specific oligonucleotides have been previously designed<br>
from an alignment of plant sesquiterpene synthases amino-acid sequences (WO<br>
04/031376). Six primers (four forward and two reverse) were designed from three regions<br>
conserved among the plant sesquiterpene synthases amino-acid sequences. They were<br>
named TpsVFl, TpsVF2, TpsCFl, TpsCF2, TpsVR3 and TpsCR3 (WO 04/031376).<br>
In addition, a set of oligonucleotides was designed for improved specificity towards<br>
sesquiterpene synthases nucleotidic sequences of vetiver. Sequence comparison of<br>
terpene synthases isolated from different plants has shown high sequence homologies in<br>
relation to phylogeny. The sequence homology is high among terpene synthases from<br>
taxonomically related species and is not related to functional specialization (enzymatic<br>
activity). We thus decided to design new sesquiterpene synthases-specific primers based<br>
on the alignment of the sequence of sesquiterpene synthases obtained from plant species<br>
related to vetiver. Vetiver is a Gramineae plant (grass family) and belongs to the<br>
Monocotyledons class (Liliopsida). The amino-acid sequences of sesquiterpene synthases<br>
from monocotyledon plants (accession number AAC31570 from Elaeis oleifera (oil<br>
palm), accession numbers BAC99549, BAC99543, AAR01759, BAD03024, NP_908798,<br>
BAC20102, AAR87368 from Oryza sativa (Rice) and accession numbers AAG37841,<br>
AAS88575, AAS88574, AAS88573, AAS88572, AAS88571 from Zea mays (corn)) were<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
25<br>
aligned using ClustalW [Thompson, J.D., Higgins, D.G. and Gibson, T.J. (1994)<br>

through sequence weighting, position specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice.<br>
Nucleic Acids Res. 22, 4673-4680] and regions conserved across all sequences were<br>
selected. From these regions, primers were design using the CODEHOP strategy [Rose<br>
T.M., Schultz E.R., Henikoff J.G, Pietrokovski S. McCallum C.M and Nenikoff S. (1998)<br>
Consensus-degenerated hybrid oligo-nucleotide primers for amplification of distantly<br>
related sequences. Nucleic Acids Research 26(7), 1628-1635] implemented as a computer<br>
program accessible over the World Wide Web<br>
[http://blocks.fhcrc.org/blocks/make blocks.html and<br>
http://blocks.fhcrc.org/blocks/codehop.html]. The parameters of the program were set so<br>
as to design primers with a degenerated core of 11 to 13 bases, a maximum degeneracy<br>
(number of different sequences specified by each primer) of 256 and an annealing<br>
temperature around 60 °C. The codon usage of the monocotyledon plant Zea mays was<br>
used. Using this approach, four forward primers and two reverse primers were designed<br>
from five conserved regions (Table 1).<br><br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
26<br>
For each primer in table 1 the nucleotide sequence is given and the corresponding<br>
amino acid sequence in the alignment is shown. The degeneracies in the nucleotides<br>
sequences are indicated using the IUPAC one letter code.<br>
These primers were used in RT-PCR experiments with total RNA extracted from<br>
vetiver roots.<br>
In all experiments, the reverse transcriptions were performed at 60°C, using<br>
vctivcr roots total RNA, an oligo(dT)2o primer and the Thermo script™ reverse<br>
transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer.<br>
The PCR conditions were adapted for the two sets of primers. With the plant-<br>
sesquiterpene-synthases-specific primers, the PCR were performed using the Platinum®<br>
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The different possible combinations of the forward<br>
primers TpsVFl, TpsVF2, TpsCFl and TpsCF2 and the reverse primers TpsVR3,<br>
TpsCR3 and dTadaptor primer (Table 2) were used for the first round PCR. The PCR mix<br>
contained 5 μL 10X PCR reaction buffer (invitrogen), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs,<br>
200 nM forward primer, 200 nM reverse primer, 0.4 μL (2 units) Platinum® Taq DNA<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
27<br>
polymerase, 2 μL of cDNA from the reverse transcription described above and distilled<br>
water to a final volume of 50 uL. The reactions were performed on a Eppendorf<br>
Mastercycler Gradiant thermal cycler and the cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at<br>
95°C; 35 cycles of 45 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 42°C, 2 min 30 sec at 72°C; and 10 min final<br>
extension at 72°C. A second round of PCR was performed with the same conditions as for<br>
the first round of PCR using as template 5 μL of the first PCR mixture and the same<br>
primers or nested primers. The size of the PCR products were evaluated on a 1% agarose<br>
gel. Among the several RT-PCR, two produced the expected fragments: TpsCFl+<br>
dTadaptor in the first PCR followed by TpsCF2+TpsCR3 in the second PCR, and<br>
TpsCF2+ dTadaptor in the first PCR followed by TpsCF2+TpsCR3 in the second PCR.<br>
The bands were excised from the gel, purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit<br>
(Qiagen) and cloned in the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning Kit<br>
(Invitrogen). Inserted cDNAs were then subject to DNA sequencing and the sequences<br>
compared against the GenBank non-redundant protein database (NCBI) using the<br>
BLASTX algorithm (Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., and Liprnan, D.J.<br>
(1990) Basic local alignment search tool. J. Mol. Biol. 215, 403-410). The comparison<br>
was performed on-line at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. The sequence analysis<br>
revealed homology with sesquiterpene synthases and comparison of the sequences<br>
showed that we had four distinct fragments of cDNA with significant sequence<br>
differences: CA711, CA717, CA782 and CA783 (Figure 2).<br>
With the monocot-sesquiterpene-synthases-specific primers, The PCR steps were<br>
performed using the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix from Clontech. Each PCR mixture<br>
contained 5 ΜL of Advantage 2 PCR Buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 200 nM each<br>
oligonucleotide primer, 2 μL of cDNA from the reverse transcription described above,<br>
1μL of Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix and distilled water to a final volume of 50 μL. The<br>
following conditions were used for the amplifications: 3 minutes of denaturation at 94°C;<br>
15 cycles of 1 minutes denaturation at 94°C, 1 min of annealing at 65°C for the first cycle<br>
and minus one degree for each following cycle, and 2 minutes extension at 72°C;<br>
20 cycles of 1 minutes denaturation at 94°C, 1 min of annealing at 58°C and 2 minutes<br>
extension at 72°C; and finally 10 minutes extension at 72°C. Different PCR were<br>
performed with the possible combination of monocot-sesquiterpene-synthases-specific<br>
forward and reverse primers. A second round of PCR was performed using as template<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
28<br>
5μL of the first PCR mixture, with the same conditions and same primers as described<br>
above for the first round of PCR. The combination of forward and reverse primers<br>
TpsmonocotF3 + TpsMonocotRl, TpsmonocotF3 + TpsMonocotR2, TpsmonocotF4 +<br>
TpsMonocotRl and TpsmonocotF4 + TpsMonocotR2 produced amplicons with the<br>
expected size. Sequence analysis and comparison showed that we had partial cDNA<br>
encoding for three distinct and new sesquitcrpene synthases: CA725, CA731 and CA733<br>
(Figure 2).<br>
Example 3<br>
Amplification of full-length cDNA encoding for sesquiterpene synthases by Rapid<br>
Amplifcation of cDNA Ends (RACE)<br>
Forward specific primers were designed from these new cDNA fragments (Table<br>
2). 3'RACE was performed as follows. First, a reverse transcription was performed at<br>
60°C using the oligo(dT)2o primer, 1.5 microg of total RNA and the Thcrmoscript™<br>
reverse transcriptase, in the same condition as described above for the RT-PCR. A first<br>
PCR was performed using the dTadaptor primer and a forward cDNA-pecific primer. The<br>
PCR mixture contained 0.4 μM cDNA-specific primer, 0.4 μM of dTadaptor primer<br>
(Table 2), 300 μM each dNTPs, 5 μL of 10X HotStartTaq® DNA polymerase buffer<br>
(Qiagen), 2 μL of the cDNA, 0.5 μL of HotStartTaq® DNA polymerase in a final volume<br>
of 50 μL. The cycling conditions were: 15 min at 95°C; 35 cycles of 45 sec at 94°C,<br>
45sec at 48°C and 2 min 30 sec at 72°C; and 10 min at 72°C. A nested PCR was<br>
performed using a PCR mixture with the same composition as above except for the<br>
following modifications: a nested cDNA-specific primer and the adaptorP primer (Table<br>
2) were used, 5 mL of the first PCR was used for the template, and the annealing<br>
temperature was increased to 60°C. The amplification products were evaluated, sub-<br>
cloned, and their sequence analyzed as described above. The 3'RACE succeeded for<br>
CA717 and CA733 (Figure 3), but not for the other cDNAs. A 3'RACE experiment with<br>
the Therrnoscript™ and the primers CA711_F1 and CA711_F2 (Table 2) and with an<br>
annealing temperature of the nested PCR lowered at 48°C instead of 60°C, allowed the<br>
non-specific amplification of the 3'end of a new sesquiterpene synthase cDNA, named<br>
CA775.<br>
Table 2: Primers used for 3'RACE and 5'RACE<br><br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
30<br>
Based on the three half-full-length sequences obtained after the 3'RACE, we<br>
designed specific reverse primers for use in 5'RACE. The 5'RACE System from<br>
Invitrogen was used. For this procedure, three primers were used for each cDNA (one to<br>
prime the reverse transcription, and two nested primers for the first and second PCR). The<br>
reverse transcription part of the protocol was adapted for transcripts with high GC<br>
content, as described by the manufacturer. The PCR was performed using the Platinum®<br>
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). For the first PCR, the template was 5 μL of dC-tailed<br>
cDNA, and a cDNA specific primer (Table 2) and the Abridged Anchor Primer<br>
(Invitrogen) were used. The cycling conditions were: 2 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 0.5 min<br>
at 94°C, 0.5 min at 55°C and 2 min at 72°C; and 10 min at 72°C, For the second PCR, the<br>
template was 5 μL of 100 fold diluted first PCR product, and a nested cDNA-specific<br>
primer (table 2) and the Universal Amplification Primer (Invitrogen). The cycling<br>
conditions for the second PCR were: 2 min at 94°C; 12 cycles of 0.5 min at 94°C, 0.5 min<br>
at 68°C for the first cycle and minus 1 °C for each subsequent cycle, and 2 min at 72°C;<br>
25 cycles of 0.5 min at 94°C, 0.5 min at 60°C and 2 min at 72°C; and 10 min at 72°C.<br>
The amplification products were evaluated, sub-cloned, and their sequence analyzed as<br>
described above.<br>
The amplification of the 5'end succeeded for CA717 and CA733, and for these<br>
two clones the full-length nucleotide sequence could be reconstituted (Vet 717: SEQ ID<br>
NO 1; Vet 733: SEQ ID NO: 2).<br>
For CA775, a first 5'RACE using the same approach allowed amplification of an<br>
820 bp fragment. The analysis of the sequence showed a 60 bp overlap with the CA775<br>
3'RACE product but revealed that the 5'RACE was not complete and that a portion of the<br>
5'end was still missing. A new set of primers was designed based on the 5'PACE<br>
sequence obtained (further close to the 5'-end) and the 5'RACE was repeated in the same<br>
condition. These permitted to obtain an additional 100 bp but the translation initiation<br>
codon was still missing.<br>
A third set of primers was designed for use with the cDNA obtained with the<br>
Marathon cDNA synthesis Eat (Clontech). The amplification was performed on an<br>
Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradiant thermal cycler with the Advantage® 2 Polymerase Mix,<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
31<br>
as described by the manufacturer. This third 5'RACE provided a additional 100 bp<br>
sequence that finally contained the start codon and thus provided the full length<br>
nucleotide sequence (Vet 775, SEQ ID NO: 3).<br>
Comparison of the aminoacid sequences deduced from the full-length<br>
sesquiterpene synthase-encoding cDNAs (named Vet717, Vet733 and Vet775,<br>
corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 4, 5 and 6, respectively) showed a relative low homology<br>
(Figure 3) (identity ranging from 31 to 40 %). The closest mach found in the public<br>
sequences databanks are putative sesquiterpenes sesquiterpene synthases sequences from<br>
Oryza sativa (Rice) and Zea mays (corn). For Vet717 and Vet775, the closest sequences<br>
are respectively 47 % and 50 % identical. Vet733 has relative high sequences homology<br>
(76.8 % identity) with sequences of sesquiterpene synthases from Zea mays encoded by<br>
the nucleotide sequences with accession number AY518310 to AY518314 (Kollner et al<br>
(2004) The Plant cell 16(5), 1115-1131). The sequence at the N-term end of Vet755<br>
differs from the two others and from other know sesquiterpene synthases: the N-terminal<br>
end is extended by 50 amino-acids and contains an unusual motif PAAAASSQQQQ<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 7). Such N-tcrminal additional sequence is unusual and docs not resemble<br>
any known peptide signal sequence.<br>
Example 4<br>
Heterologous expression in bacteria of the sesquiterpene synthases from vetiver<br>
The Vel717 full-length cDNA was amplified from the Marathon cDNA library<br>
using the primers CA717_Nde and CA717_Kpn (Table 3) designed from the sequence<br>
information obtained by RACE. PCR was performed using the Pfu polymerasc<br>
(Promega), in a final volume of 50 μl containing 5μl of Pfu DNA polymerase 10X buffer,<br>
200 ΜM each dNTP, 0.4 ΜM each forward and reverse primer, 2.9 units Pfu DNA<br>
polymerase and 5 μl of 100-fold diluted cDNA (prepared as described above using the<br>
Marathon™ cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech)). The thermal cycling conditions were as<br>
follows: 2 min at 95°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 55°C and 4 min at 72°C;<br>
and 10 min at 72°C. The PCR product, consisting of the full-length Vet717 cDNA<br>
containg a Ndel site including the translation initiation codon and the Kpnl site<br>
immediately after the stop codon, was purified on an agarose gel and eluted using the<br>
QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The PCR product was digested with Ndel and<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
32<br>
Kpnl and ligated into the pETDuet-1 plasmid (Novagen) digested with the same enzymes.<br>
Sequencing of the insert showed no sequence difference with the RACE products.<br>
Table 3: Primers used for construction of the expression plasmids<br>
The plasmid was then transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). Single<br>
colonies of transformed cells were used to inoculate 5 ml LB medium. After 5 to 6 hours<br>
incubation at 37°C, the cultures were cooled to a 20°C and expression of the protein was<br>
induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After over-night incubation the cells were collected by<br>
centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml Extraction Buffer (50 mM MOPSO pH 7, 5 mM<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
33<br>
DTT, 10% glycerol) and sonicated 3 times 20 s. The cell debris were sediraented by<br>
centrifugation 30 rain at 18,000g and the supernatant containing the soluble proteins was<br>
recovered. Analysis by SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the production of a recombinant<br>
protein with the expected molecular weight.<br>
In the same way, the Vet733 cDNA was amplified from the Marathon cDNA<br>
library using the primers 733_Nco and 733_Eco (Table 3) and ligated as a Ndel-EcoRl<br>
fragment into the pETDuet-1 expression plasmid. The constructs were verified by<br>
sequencing. The heterologous expression in BL2KDE3) using these plasmids provided a<br>
recombinant protein clearly visible by SDS-PAGE.<br>
For ligation of Vet775 into the pETDuet-1 expression plasmid, since the cDNA<br>
already contained two Ndel and one Ncol restriction sites (respectively at position 603,<br>
1483 and 1020), the amplification was performed in two stages, using the overlap<br>
extension PCR strategy (Horton, R.M., Hunt, H.D., Do, S.N., Pullen, J.K. and Pease, L.R.<br>
(1989) Engineering hybrid genes without the use of restriction enzymes: gene splicing by<br>
overlap extension. Gene 77, 61-68), in order to introduce the Ncol and Ecorl sites at the<br>
extremities and to remove the internal Ncol restriction site. Two separate PCR reactions<br>
were first performed: one with primers Vet775_Nco (introducing a Ncol site immediately<br>
before the start codon) and 775_mut_F2; the second with the primers 775_mut_R2 and<br>
775_fus_Eco (introducing a EcoRI site immediately after the stop codon). The<br>
775_mut_F2 and 775_mut_R2 primers are forward and reverse mutagenic primers with<br>
32 nucleotides overlapping region and allowing the suppression of the Ncol recognition<br>
site at position 1020 in the cDNA without modifying the protein sequence (change the<br>
codon for Ala340 from GCC to GCA) (Table 3). The products from these two PCR were<br>
purified, combined and used as template in a last PCR were the full-length mutated<br>
Vct775 cDNA is amplified with the primers Vct775_Nco and 775_fus_Eco. The PCR<br>
product was then ligated between the Ncol and EcoRI restriction sites of the pETDuet-1<br>
plasmid.<br>
In addition, to evaluate the effect of the unusual N-terminal sequence of Vet775<br>
on the expression in E. coli and on the enzymatic activity, we made two constructs<br>
consisting of removing portions of the N-terminal end of Vet775 and replacing them with<br>
the equivalent portion derived from Vet717. Two modified cDNA were thus made,<br>
Vet775_fusl and Vet775_fus2. In the first construct, the 68 first codons were removed<br>
and replaced with the 24 N-terminal codons of Vet717. In the second construct, the 91<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/EB2006/051831<br>
34<br>
first codons were removed and replaced with the 42 N-terminal codons of Vet717. These<br>
construct were made by overlap extension PCR. For Vet775_fusl, a first PCR was<br>
performed using the primers 775_fus_Nco and 775_fusl-r and as template the Vet717<br>
cDNA in pETDuet-1. A second PCR was performed with the primers 775_fusl-f and<br>
775_fus_Eco and as template the Marathon cDNA library. The primers 775_fusl-f and<br>
775_fus 1-r contain an overlapping region of 29 nucleotides (Table 3). The PCR products<br>
from the two amplifications were purified and used as template in another PCR using as<br>
the primers 775_fus_Nco and 775_fus_Eco. The PCR product, consisting of the open<br>
reading frame of Vet775 with the 204 5'-end bp replaced by the 72 5'-end bp of Vet717<br>
and flanked by the Ncol and Ecorl restriction sites, was ligated in the pCR®2.1-TOPO<br>
vector using the TOPO TA cloning Kit (In vitro gen). The inserts from three separated<br>
clones were fully sequenced to ensure that there was no sequence variation. The plasmid<br>
was then used as template for site directed mutagencsis by overlap extension PCR to<br>
remove the two Ncol sites at position 72 and 888 in nucleotidic sequence. This last<br>
modification was performed as described above by generating three overlapping<br>
fragments using the mutagenic primers pairs 775_mut_Fl and 775_mut_Rl (change the<br>
codon for Pro24 from CCA to CCT) (Table 3) and 775_mut_F2 and 775_mut_R2<br>
(described above). The PCR product was finally ligated between the Ncol and EcoRl<br>
restriction sites of the pETDuet-1 plasmid. The construction of the cDNA coding for the<br>
Vet775_fus2 was made in the same way using the primers 775_fus2-f and 775_fus2-r<br>
(Table 3) in the first PCR to produce a cDNA consisting of nucleotides 1-126 for Vet717<br>
fused to the nucleotides 274 to 1521 fro Vct775.<br>
All these PCR for the amplification of the full-length or modified Vet775 cDNA<br>
were performed with the Pfu DNA poiymerasc as described above.<br>
Heterologous expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis<br>
showed the production of a recombinant protein for the Vet775_fusl and Vet775_fus2<br>
constructs, but no recombinant protein was seen for the full-length non-modified Vet775.<br>
Example 5<br>
Characterization of the enzyme activities of the recombinant sesquiterpene<br>
synthases<br>
The recombinant proteins obtained were assayed for sesquitepene synthase<br>
activity using FPP as substrate. The enzymatic assays were performed in Teflon sealed<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
35<br>
glass tubes using 50 to 100 μl of crude E. coli protein extract, obtained following the<br>
procedure given in Example 3 (following Table 3) in a final volume of 1 mL Extraction<br>
Buffer supplemented with 15 mM MgCl2 and 100 to 250 uM purified FPP. The media<br>
were overlaid with 1 ml pentane and the tubes incubated 12 to 18 hours at 30°C.<br>
The sesquiterpenes produced were extracted twice with pentane and analyzed by<br>
GC and GC/MS as described previously (WO 04/031376, Example 6).<br>
Enzymes assays with protein extracts obtained from cultures of E. coli<br>
transformed with the expression plasmids containing the Vet775 Full-length cDNA or the<br>
two Vet775 fusion proteins, did not permit to detect any sesquiterpene synthase activity.<br>
The reasons for this apparent inactivity remain undetermined.<br>
The Vet717 recombinant protein (SEQ ID NO: 4) produced a major sesquiterpene<br>
hydrocarbon and several minor products (Figure 4). The mass spectrum of the major<br>
product matched the mass spectrum of cyclosativene ((6) in Figure 1) and the rentention<br>
time of this major product lined up with the retention time of a cyclosativene standard, on<br>
an apolar (SPB-1, Supelco) as well as on a polar column (InnoWax, Hewlett-packard).<br>
Cyclosativene or derivatives thereof were never identified in vetiver oil. Among the many<br>
sesquiterpenes identified, (he oxygenated cyclocopacamphane sesquiterpenes (Figure 1)<br>
are the most structurally close to cyclosativene. Cyclocopacamphene (7) is the<br>
stereoisomer of cyclosativene (Kido F et al (1969) Tetrahedron letters 37, 3169-3172)<br>
and interestingly, oxygenated derivatives of cyclocopacamphene are present in relative<br>
large quantities, up to 4%, in vetiver oil (Homa ct al (1970) Tetrahedron letters 3, 231-<br>
234; Weyerstahl et al (2000) Flavour Frag. J. 15, 61-83; Weyerstahl et al (2000) Flavour<br>
Frag. J. 15, 153-173; Weyerstahl et al (2000) Flavour Frag. J. 15, 395-412).<br>
To distinguish the product of Vet717 from cyclosativene, I employed chiral GC<br>
chromatography using a Megadex-5 (MEGA s.n.c, Legnano, Italy) capillary column (12<br>
m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 |im) with the initial oven temperature set at 60°C for 2 min hold,<br>
followed by a ramp of 5°C/min to 150°C and a second ramp of 20°C/min to 270°C. In<br>
these conditions, cyclosativene had a retention time of 5.60 min and was clearly separated<br>
from the Vet717 product that had a retention time of 5.75 min.<br>
The Vet717 enzyme produces also several minor products which, based on the MS<br>
spectra, could have related structures such as cubebane or copaane skeletons.<br>
The Vet733 recombinant protein (SEQ ID NO: 5) does not produce a major<br>
product but a mixture of at least 7 different sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (Figure 5). The<br>
WO 2006/134523 PCT/IB2006/051831<br>
36<br>
following compounds could be identified based on the MS spectra and comparison of the<br>
rentention index with published data: (1) cis-alpha-bergamotene, (2) trans-alpha-<br>
bergamotene, (3) epi-beta-santalene, (4) beta-bisabolene, and (5) trans-gama-bisabolene.<br>
They were further confirmed by comparison to in house standards containing beta-<br>
bisabolene, trans-gama-bisabolene, trans-alpha-bergamotene and cis-alpha-bergamotene.<br>
The structure of epi-beta-santalene was confirmed by comparison to a GC-MS analysis of<br>
opoponax extract.<br>
The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons produced by Vet733, or derivatives of these<br>
sesquiterpenes, have never been isolated from vetiver oil. It could be possible that Vet733<br>
is expressed at low level in the roots of vetiver and that the sesquiterpenes produced by<br>
this enzyme are present in the oil at a level to low to be detected. The alcohols derivatives<br>
of some of the products of Vet733, (Z)-(+)-epi-beta-santalol and (Z)-alpha-trans-<br>
bergamotol (Figure 1), have been described as being important contributors to the scent of<br>
sandalwood oil (DE 3 205 320; Frater, G., Bajgrowicz, J.A, and Kraft, P. (1998)<br>
Fragrance Chemistry. Tetrahedron 456, 7633-7703.). The odour of vetiver is very<br>
complex and, among many others, the sandalwood-likc note has been described for this<br>
oil. It could thus be possible that the sandalwood aspect could be related to the presence<br>
of trace amounts of oxygenated derivatives of the Vet733 products.<br>
Drawing of the mechanistic scheme for the formation of the sesquiterpenes<br>
produced by Vet733 explains the relationship of the multiple products formed (Figure 6).<br>
Each turnover cycle starts with the isomerization of FPP ((16) in Figure 6) to nerolydol-<br>
pyrophosphate (NPP) (with rotation about the C2-C3 bond), followed by cyclization to the<br>
bisabolyl cation (17). The cyclization can then go on via several mechanisms. The beta-<br>
bisabolene and trans-gamma-bisbolene can be formed by deprotonation at C6 or C14<br>
respectively. C2-C7 closure followed by deprotonation leads to cis- and trans-alpha-<br>
bergamotenes. C3-C7 closure, followed by Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement and<br>
deprotonation at C15 leads to epi-beta-santalene. The Vet733 sesquiterpene synthase is the<br>
first cloned sesquiterpene synthase able to catalyse the cyclisation of FPP to the bisabolyl<br>
cation and subsequent cyclization to the bergamotane and santalane skeleton.<br>
