				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS  FOR  FRSQUENCY  PLANNING IN A  CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS  SYSTEM<br>
USING  MODIFIED  NEIGHBOUR LISTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cellular communication systems. The<br>
present invention relates in particular, but not exclusively, to data collection for<br>
frequency planning for cellular communication systems based on measurement<br>
reports. Cellular communications systems to which the present invention may be<br>
applied include  for example, Global System for Mobile Telecommunication<br>
(GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and General<br>
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a cellular communications system, the area over which service is<br>
provided is divided into a number of smaller areas called cells. Typically each.<br>
cell is served from, a base Transceiver  station (BTS) which has an antenra or<br>
antennas for transmission to and reception from a large number of user stations,<br>
normally mobile stations  e.g. mobile telephones. Examples of established<br>
harmonised, cellular radio communications systems are Global System for Mobile<br>
Telecommunication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) systems. A<br>
further harmonised standard being introduced is the Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (UMTS).<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>

In cellular communication systems, multiple frequency channels are used<br>
in each cell, as well as used in different cells. A technique known as frequency<br>
hopping is used within cells to provide diversity. The choice of which<br>
frequencies are to be used in which cells plays an important rate in the efficiency<br>
and quality of service in. a system. For example, adjoining cells are prone to<br>
interfere with each other, so appropriate selection of frequencies may reduce<br>
such interference.<br>
However, in order to achieve efficient usage of resources and provide<br>
service to large numbers of users, practically it is necessary to employ frequency<br>
plans that may  involve potential interference. Various methods are known for<br>
testing systems to acquire, data to enable frequency plans to be improved. One<br>
example is drive testing. Another example is to collect data from measurement<br>
reports that are anyway produced in the operation of the cellular communication<br>
system. Such measurement reports are produced by mobile stations and<br>
transmitted to control unite of the system infrastructure.<br>
The measurement reports comprise details of e.g. signal strength<br>
measured by the mobile station on the frequency or frequencies it is<br>
communicating with in its own cell, In addition, the measurement reports<br>
comprise similar details of frequencies that correspond to certain neighbouring<br>
cells, The mobile station is informed of which frequencies (and in effect which<br>
neighbouring cells) to mueasure and report by virtue of these being on a so called<br>
neighbour list, determined by a control unit of the infrastrtucture of the system<br>
     and communicated to the user station. The neighbour list is primary provided<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
-3-<br>
to enable preparation  for handover however of interest here is the fact that<br>
measurements of the neighbouring cells and frequencies can be used in<br>
frequency planning<br>
In GSM systems, the neighbour list is transmitted to the mobile stations on<br>
a control channel called the Slow Aasociated Control Channel (SACCH), and<br>
hence the neighbour list may conveniently be called a SACCH neighbour list<br>
Neighbours included for the primary purpose of potential handover planning<br>
me known as configured neighbours. For the purpose of providing measurement<br>
repents for collecting data for frequency planning, extra measurement<br>
frequencies are added ta the SACCCH neighbour list. The extra frequencies  are<br>
known as test fcequencies or test neghbours.<br>
Convertionally  the same SACCH neighbour list is transmitted to all user<br>
stations in a given cell. Also, conventionally the tats frequencies employed in a<br>
given cell are changed once a day, so that over the course of a number of days all<br>
the frequencies it is desired to test may be included.<br>
In each system there is a predetermined limit as to the total number of<br>
neighbour cells/frequenries that may be set. In GSM this limit is 32. However,<br>
there may be a large number of configured netghbours in a given cell leaving <br>
only a small number of test frequencies that may be employed each day. Thus<br>
the conventional approach is often slow and inefficient.<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
-4-<br>
Moreover, by requiring different best frequencies to be tested on different<br>
days, the resulting data may not be properly representative of the real life<br>
situation, as statistical affects due to different communications traffic on different<br>
days may distort the results.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Embodiments of the priesent invention will now be described, by way of<br>
example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which <br>
FIG. 1is a schematic illustration of a small part of a GSM cellular<br>
communication system;<br>
FIG. 2 shows a table of frequency channels allocated against neighbour<br>

Description of00Preferred Embodiment<br>
FIG-1 is schematic illustration of  a small part of  a GSM cellular<br>
communication system 1 having a coverage area formed by a number of cells 12-<br>
22. A conventional schematic representation showing a hexagonal cell pattern<br>
has been used to depict the cell  areas  but in practic the shape and size of each  <br>
cell will be different.<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
                                                                            -6-<br>
In each cell there is a base station system (BSS) 24-34.  In this embodiment<br>
each BSS 24-34 is an integrated base station controller  (BSC) and base transceiver<br>
station (BTS). In practice large numbers of mobile stations (MSs) will receive<br>
service from the infrastructure shown In FIG. 1. However, for clarity, only a few<br>
such. MSs are shown namely  MSs 42, 44, 46 and 48.<br>
The BSSs  144-34 are each coupled to a mobile Service Switing Centre <br>
(MSC) 50. The MSC 50 is coupled to an Operations and Management Centre<br>
(OMC) 49 and to a Public Swithed Telephone Network (PSTN) 51.<br>
In  operation, the BSSs 24-34 raceived radio signals from the MSs and<br>
transmits radio signals to the MSs. The MSC 50 provides interconnectton and<br>
routing both within the cellular  communication  system 10  (in co-operation with<br>
others  MSCs, not shown, covering other areas) and to external element  via the<br>
PSTN51. The OMC 49 is usedty the operator of the cellular communicationm<br>
system 1 to configure and maintain the system 1.<br>
Each BSS 24-34 allocates and transmits neighbour lists to MSs  receiving<br>
service In the corresponding cells. This is implemented by databases and software<br>
at the respective BSSs, under instruction from the OMC 49. The neighbour lis is<br>
are transmitted from the BSSs to the MSs using the Slow Associated Control<br>
Channel(SACCH).<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
-7-<br>
In this embodiment, the BSSs 24-34 have been adapted to offer, and<br>
provide for, a different way of Conning the SACCH neighbour lists, as will be<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
However, this adaptation may be implemented in any suitable manner. A<br>
new module may be added to a conventional BSS, The module may consist of a<br>
single discrete entity added, to a conventional BSS, or may  alternatively  be<br>
formed by adapting existing parts of a conventional BSS, far example by<br>
repiogiamming of a one or more processors therein. As such the required<br>
adaptation  may be implemented  the form of  processor-implementable <br>
instructions stored on a storage medium such as a floppy disk, hard disk;<br>
PROM, RAM or any combination of these or other storage media. Furthermore,<br>
whether a separate entity or an adaptation of existing parts or a combination of<br>
these, the module may be implemented in the form of hardware, firmware,<br>
software, ot any combination of these.<br>
It is also within the contemplation of the invention that such adaptation of<br>
the means for forming SACCH neighbour lists may alternatively be controlled<br>
implemented in full, or implemented in part, by a module  added to  or formed by<br>
adaptation of any other suitable part of the cellular communication system 1 or<br>
other cellular communication systems. For example this may be implemented<br>
instead at separate. BTSs or  BSCs when the BSSs are of a form comprising <br>
separate BTSs and BSCs. As another example, this may be implemented at<br>
OMCs, in situation where  OMCs of systems can directly  implement  neighbout<br>
lists. Further, in the case of other system infrastructures or layouts,<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
-8-<br>
impplementation may be at any appropriate system node such as any other<br>
appropriate type of base station, base station controller etc Alternatively various<br>
parts of the process and means for forming the adapted! neighbour lists can be<br>
carrried  out by  various componenis distributed at different locations or entitles<br>
within the above described cellular communication system 1 or any other<br>
suitable cellular communication network or system.<br>
The way in which, in this embodiment, the BSSs 24-34 form the SACCH<br>
neighbour lists will now be described, with reference to FIG, 2 and 3.<br>
In. this embodiment , the BSSs 24-34 each form  and allocate  SACCH<br>
neighbour listes on a per call basis. Thus, in terms of an overview, the SACCH<br>
neighbour listes  fromed  and allocated separately  east  time a call is  conducted<br>
to/from each MS. In this embodiment, a different SACCH neighbour list is<br>
formed for each call in each cell.<br>
This process will now be described by use of a simplified example. FIG, 2<br>
shows a table of frequency channels 206 allocated against neighbour positions<br>
202 over the course of three calls 204 (call number 1,2 and 3 in the table)<br>
serviced  BSS 28 with respect  to MSs in its cell, i.e., a first call oanducted. by/for<br>
MS 44 a second call conducted by/for MS 46, and a  third call conducted by/for<br>
MS 48.In this example these calls are taking  place at the same time (i.e. overlap<br>
in time, although not necessarily starting of ending at the same time), although<br>
the process described-below may also be applied to different calls at different<br>
    times.<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
                                                                          -9-<br>
In this simplified example, for the sake of clarity, only 12 neighbour<br>
positions 202, numbered 1-12 are included. However, as mentioned earlier,<br>
under GSM a maximum of 32 are usually employed. Thus, in this example in<br>
any neighbour list only twelve frequencies (i e. frequency channels) may be<br>
included Also, for the sake of carity, the number of available frequencies<br>
(frequency channels) is limited rn this simplified example to sixteen, made up of<br>
the eight frequencies called 1-3 in FIG. 2 and the eight frequencies called 12-19 in<br>
FIG. 2, In this example, the frequencies 1-6 and 12-19 are used to indicate how<br>
there are usually gaps in the frequency channels employed, e.g. here frequencies<br>
9-11 are unavailable.<br>
In this example, for the first call, the BSS 28 forms, allocates and transmits<br>
(to the MS 44 conducyting the  first call) a first neighbour list 208. The first<br>
neighbour list 208 comprises configured frequencies 1, 3,4,7,12 and 17 in<br>
neighbour  positions 1 to 6 respectively. (Stricly speaking these are the Broadcast/<br>
Control Channel (BCCH) parts of the frequency entries in the neighbour list;<br>
which in full also include  Base Transceiver Station Identity Code (BSIC) parts.<br>
However, snch details aie well known to the skilled person in the art of cellular<br>
communications systems, in particular GSM, and need not be described further<br>
here for the purpose of explaining the present invention,) The first neighbour list<br>
208 further comprises test frequencies 2, 5, 6,8,13 and 14 in neighbour positions<br>
7 to 12 respectively.<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
-10-<br>
For the second  call, the ESS 28 forms, allocates and transmits (to the MS 46<br>
conducting  the second  call) a second neighbour list 210, The second neighbour<br>
list 210 comprises configured frequencies 1-4,3-5,4 -7,7-4,12-4 and 17-3 in<br>
neighbour positions 1 to 6 respectively- These are the same configured<br>
frequencies/neighbour positions as in the first neighbour list 208. However, the<br>
second neighbour list 210 further comprises test fnequeaties 15,16,16,19, 2 and 5<br>
 in neighbour  positions 7 to 12  respectively  i e. overall  the  second neighbour list<br>
210 is different (o the first neighbour list 209,<br>
For the third call, the BSS 28 forms, allocates and transmits  (to the MS 48<br>
conducting the third call) a third neighbour list 212. The third neighbour list 212<br>
conpsprises configured frequencies 1-4, 3-5, 4-7, 7-4,  12- 4 and 17-3 in neighbour<br>
positions 1 to 6 respectively . These are the same configured<br>
frequences/neighbour position as in the first neightour list 208 and the second<br>
frequencies 6,8,13,14,15 and 16 in neighbour positions 7 to 12 respectively i.e.<br>
overall the third neighbour list 217 is different to both the first neighbour list 208<br>
and the second neighbour list 210.<br>
Thus, for each of the three calls, a different neighbour list is employed.<br>
A benefit of the frequency allocation described above wite reference to<br>
FIG. 2 may be  seen with reference to FIG.3 . FIG. 3 is a table showing  which of<br>
the above described frequencies 206 will have been measured during the above<br>
     described calls 204 (this is indicated in FIG. 3 by an "X" in. esch case). As can be<br><br>
WO 2004/066655                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/050036<br>
-11-<br>
seen,  all  16 frequencies (i.e. l-8 and 12-19) will have been measured. This is in<br>
contrast to the fact that if the same neighbour list has been used for all three calls<br>
(as per the prior art) only some the fiequencies  would have been measured,<br>
(Of course, in some applications, not all frequencies will be measure, however<br>
there  will still tend to be an advantageous  increase in the number of frequencies<br>
measured compared to the number measured with a common unchanging<br>
neighbour list.)<br>
In the above described embodiment a different SACCH neighbour list  is<br>
formed for each call in each cell. However, there are a number of ways in which a<br>
less extreme variation is employed, whilst still making effective use of the<br>
concept of forming and allocating the SACCH neighbour list on a per call basis.<br>
For example it may be that all possible combinations are testad in a given<br>
time before it is wished to stop testing. In this case some or all of the transmitted<br>
combinations may be used again.<br>
As another example, a subset of combinations of neighbour lists may be<br>
provided which are belleved  to cover all variables requised to be assessed, and<br>
these may be opened on  a cyclical basis.<br>
As another example, the process may be applied to substantially all calls,<br>

calls to certain MSs  may be excluded from variation.<br>
AS another example, the process may be applied to some but not all the<br>
cells of the cellular communications system.<br>
As another example, the process may be applied for some period or<br>
periods during the day but not all day.<br>
As another example, the neighbour list may be varied for plural numbers<br>
of calls rather than every call. For example, a given neighbour list may be used<br>
for two calls. then changed to a new list used for a further two calls, and so an.<br>
Any appropriate number of calls for such a regime (i.e. as opposed, to every one<br>
or every two calls) may be used according to the requirements at the particular<br>
system of situation under consideration,<br>
Also  any two or more of the above examples may occur in combination.<br>
Thus, the terminology "on a per call basis " as used herein is to  be<br>
    understood as encompassing  different ways  of varying the neighbour lists<br>
according  to different calls bening serviced, rather  than being in.dependent.of calls,<br>
and rather  than being uniformly implemented icrespective of which calls are<br>
being processed.<br><br>
