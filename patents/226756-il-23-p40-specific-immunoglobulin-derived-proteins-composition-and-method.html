				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to at least one IL-23p40 specific human Ig derived protein or<br>
fragment thereof, encoding and complementary nucleic acids, host cells, and methods of making and<br>
using thereof, including therapeutic formulations, administration and devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is the name given to a factor that is composed of the p40 subunit of IL-<br>
12 (IL-12beta, IL-12-p40) and another protein of 19 kDa, designated pl9. pl9 is structurally related<br>
to DL6, G-CSF, and the p35 subunit of IL-12. Like IL-12 p35, IL-23 pl9 cannot be secreted as a<br>
monomer and has not demonstrated biological function. Rather, each subunit must partner with p40<br>
to be expressed by antigen presenting cells (APC) and mediate biologic effects. The active complex<br>
is secreted by dendritic cells after cell activation. Mouse memory T-cells (CD4 (+)CD45 Rb(low))<br>
proliferate in response to IL-23 but not in response to IL-12. Human IL23 has been shown to<br>
stimulate the production of IFN-gamma by PHA blast T-cells and memory T-cells. It also induces<br>
proliferation of both cell types. Human monocyte-derived macrophages produce IL23 in response to<br>
virus infection (Sendai virus but not Influenza A virus).<br>
IL-23 binds to the beta-1 subunit but not to the beta-2 subunit of the IL-12 receptor, activating<br>
one of the STAT proteins, STAT-4, in PHA blast T-cells. The EL-23 receptor consists of a receptor<br>
chain, tenned IL-23R, and the beta-1 subunit of the DL-12 receptor. The human IL-23R gene is on<br>
human chromosome 1 within 150 kb of the gene encoding EL-12Rbeta2. EL-23 activates the same<br>
signaling molecules as EL-12: JAK2, Tyk2, and STAT-1, STAT-3, STAT-4, and STAT-5. STAT-4<br>
activation is substantially weaker and different DNA-binding STAT complexes form in response to<br>
IL-23 compared with IL-12. IL-23R associates constirutively with JAK2 and in a ligand-dependent<br>
manner with STAT-3.<br>
Expression of pl9 in transgenic mice leads to ranting, systemic inflammation, infertility, and<br>
death before 3 months of age. The animals show high serum concentrations of the pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokines TNF-alpha and IL1 The number of circulating neutrophils is increased. Acute phase<br>
proteins are expressed constitutively. Animals expressing pl9 specifically in the liver do not show<br>
these abnormalities. Expression of p19 is most likely due to hematopoietic cells as bone marrow<br>
transplantation of cells expressing pl9 causes the same phenotype as that observed in the transgenic<br>
animals.<br>
Biologically active DL-12 exists as a heterodimer comprised of 2 covalently linked subunits of<br>
35 (p35) and 40 (p40) kD. IL-12 acts by binding to both the IL-12beta 1 and beta 2 receptor proteins<br><br>
and thereby induces signaling in a cell presenting both of these receptors. Several lines of evidence<br>
have demonstrated that IL-12 can induce robust Thl immune responses that are characterized by<br>
production of IFNy and IL-2 from CD4+T cells.<br>
IL-12 is produced by APCs in response to a variety of pathogens. One example is the<br>
protozoan parasite Leishnaiiia major, which has been used as an in vivo model for defining factors<br>
involved in T cell development. Resistant strains of mice developed Thl responses characterized by<br>
robust IFNy production. In contrast, susceptible mice demonstrate a Th2 cytokine profile most often<br>
described by IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 production. It was shown that EL-12 could restore immune<br>
function in susceptible mice and administration of a neutralizing anti-p40 antibody resulted in disease<br>
onset in otherwise resistant strains. This change in disease susceptibility was associated with a<br>
reversal of T cell cytokine profiles. Therefore, IL-12 has been identified as a critical parameter in<br>
defining Thl differentiation.<br>
Inappropriate Thl responses, and thus IL-12 expression, are believed to correlate with many<br>
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and uveitis. In animal<br>
models, IL-12 neutralization through its p40 subunit was shown to ameliorate immune-mediated<br>
inflammatory diseases. For example, administration of recombinant IL-12 exacerbated EAE, and<br>
reatment with neutralizing anti-p40 antibodies inhibited EAE onset or relapses. In addition, IL-12<br>
p40+mice are completely resistant to EAE even though mice deficient in other pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokines, such as IFN, TNFα, or LTα, remain susceptible. IL-12 p35+mice are fully susceptible to<br>
HAE, which suggests that alternative p40 cytokines, such as IL-23, are responsible for such diseases.<br>
The role of IL-23 in EAE and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) has been recendy confirmed in studies<br>
using p19+ mice. These animals demonstrated complete resistance to disease induction, similar to<br>
p40+mice.<br>
Non-human, chimeric, polyclonal (e.g., anti-sera) and/or monoclonal antibodies<br>
(Mabs) and fragments (e.g., proteolytic digestion products thereof) are potential therapeutic<br>
agents that are being developed in some cases to attempt to treat certain diseases. However,<br>
such antibodies ihat comprise non-human portions elicit an immune response when<br>
administered to humans. Such an immune response can result in an immune complex-<br>
mediated clearance of the antibodies from the circulation, and make repeated administration<br>
unsuitable for therapy, thereby reducing the therapeutic benefit to the patient and limiting the<br>
readmininistration of the Ig derived protein. For example, repeated adrninistration of antibodies<br>
comprising non-human portions can lead to serum sickness and/or anaphalaxis. In order to<br>
avoid these and other such problems, a number of approaches have been taken to reduce the<br>
iminunogenicity of such antibodies and portions thereof, including chimerization and<br><br>
"humanization," as well known in the art These approaches have produced antibodies having<br>
reduced immunogenicity, but with other less disirable properties.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to provide anti-IL-23p40 antibodies or specified portions or<br>
variants, nucleic acids, host cells, compositions, and methods of making and using thereof, that<br>
overcome one more of these problems.<br>

Ig derived proteins of the Present Invention<br>
The term "Ig derived protein" is intended to encompass Ig derived proteins, digestion<br>
fragments, specified portions and variants thereof, including Ig derived protein mimetics or<br><br>
comprising portions of Ig derived proteins that mimic the structure and/or function of an antibody or<br>
specified fragment or portion thereof, including single chain Ig derived proteins and fragments<br>
thereof, and is also intended to encompass proteins mat contain miitaetics to therapeutic proteins,<br>
antibodies, arid digestioi fragments, specified portions and variants thereof, wherein the protein<br>
comprises at least one functional EL-23p40 protein ligand binding region (LBR) that optionally<br>
replaces at least one complementarity determing region (CDR) of the antibody from which the Ig-<br>
derived protein, portion or variant is derived. Such IL-23p40 IgG derived proteins, specified portions<br>
or variants include those that mimic the structure and/or function of at least one IL-23p40 protein<br>
antagonist, such as an IL-23p40 protein antibody or receptor or ligahd protein, or fragment or analog.<br>
Functional fragments include antigen-binding fragments that bind to human IL-23p40 proteins or<br>
fragments thereof. For example, Ig derived protein fragments capable of binding to human IL-23p40<br>
proteins or fragments thereof, including, but not limited to, Fab (e.g., by papain digestion), Fab' (e.g.,<br>
by pepsin digestion and partial reduction) and F(ab')2 (e.g., by pepsin digestion), facb (e.g., by<br>
plasmin digestion), pFc' (e.g., by pepsin or plasmin digestion), Fd (e.g., by pepsin digestion, partial<br>
reduction and reaggregation), Fv or scFv (e.g., by molecular biology techniques) fragments, are<br>
encompassed by the invention (see, e.g., Colligan, Immunology, supra).<br>
Such fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage, synthetic or recombinant techniques,<br>
as known in the art and/or as described herein. Ig derived proteins can also be produced in a variety<br>
of truncated forms using Ig derived protein genes in which one or more stop codons have been<br>
introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a F(abr)2 heavy<br>
chain portion c an be designed to include DNA sequences encoding the CH1 domain and/or hinge<br>
region of the heavy chain. The various portions of Ig derived proteins can be joined together<br>
chemically by conventional techniques, or can be prepared as a contiguous protein using genetic<br>
engineering techniques. For example, a nucleic acid encoding the variable and constant regions of a<br>
human Ig derived protein chain can be expressed to produce a contiguous protein. See, e.g., Colligan,<br>
Immunology, supra, sections 2.8 and 2.10, for fragmentation and Ladner etal, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,946,778 and Bird, R.E. et al, Science, 242:423-426 (1988), regarding single chain Ig derived<br>
proteins, each of which publications are entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As used herein, the term "human Ig derived protein" refers to an Ig derived protein in which<br>
i ubstantially every part of the protein (e.g., CDR, LBR, framework, CL, CHdomains (e.g., CH1, CH2,<br>
CH3), hinge, (VL, VH)) is substantially non-immunogenic, with only minor sequence changes or<br>
variations. Such changes or variations optionally and preferably retain or reduce the immunogenicity<br>
in humans relative to non-modified human Ig derived proteins. Thus, a human Ig derived protein is<br>
distinct from a chimeric or humanized Ig. It is pointed out that a hurflan Ig derived protein can be<br>
produced by a non-human animal or prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that is capable of expressing<br>
functionally rea rranged human immunoglobulin (e.g., heavy chain anoVor light chain) genes. Further,<br>
v/hen a human ig derived protein is a single chain Ig derived protein, it can comprise a linker peptide<br><br>
that is not found in native human Ig derived proteins. For example, an Fv can comprise a linker<br>
peptide, such as two to about eight glycine or other amino acid residues, which connects the variable<br>
region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain. Such linker peptides are<br>
considered to be of human origin. IL-23p40 Ig derived proteins mat comprise at least one IL-23p40<br>
protein ligand or receptor thereof can be designed against an appropriate ligand, such as isolated<br>
and/or IL-23p40 protein, or a portion thereof (including synthetic molecules, such as synthetic<br>
peptides). Preparation of such IL-23p40 Ig derived proteins are performed using known techniques to<br>
identify and characterize ligand binding regions or sequences of at least one IL-23p40 protein or<br>
portion thereof.<br>
Human Ig derived proteins that are specific for the p40 subunit can be raised against an<br>
appropriate immunogenic antigen, such as isolated IL-23 protein or a portion thereof (including<br>
synthetic molecules, such as synthetic peptides). Preparation of immunogenic antigens, and<br>
monoclonal Ig derived protein production can be performed using any suitable technique. A variety<br>
of methods have been described (see e.g., Kohler etaL, Nature, 256:495-497 (197S) and Eur. J.<br>
Immunol 6:511-519 (1976); Milstein et al. Nature 266:550-552 (1977); Koprowski et al, U.S.<br>

suitable cell line as known in the art, see, e.g., www.atcc.org. www.lifetech.com., and the like, each of<br>
which is entirely incorporated herein by reference) with Ig derived protein, producing cells, such as,<br>
but not limited to, isolated or cloned spleen cells, or any other cells expressing heavy or light chain<br>
constant or variable or framework or CDR sequences, either as endogenous or heterologous nucleic<br>
acid, as recombinant or endogenous, viral, bacterial, algal, prokaryotic, amphibian, insect, reptilian,<br>
fish, mammalian, rodent, equine, ovine, goat, sheep, primate, eukaryotic, genomic DNA, cDNA,<br>
rDNA, mitochondrial DNA orRNA, chloroplast DNA orRNA, hnRNA, mRNA, tRNA, single,<br>
double or triple stranded, hybridized, and the like or any combination thereof. See, e.g., Ausubel,<br>
supra, and Colligan, Immunology, supra, chapter 2, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Ig derived protein producing cells can be obtained from the peripheral blood or, preferably the<br>
spleen or lymph nodes, of humans or other suitable animals that have been immunized with the<br>
antigen of interest. Any other suitable host cell can also be used for expressing heterologous or<br>
endogenous nucleic acid encoding an Ig derived protein, specified fragment or variant thereof, of the<br><br>
present invention. The fused cells (hybridomas) or recombinant cells can be isolated using selective<br>
culture conditions or other suitable known methods, and cloned by limiting dilution or cell sorting, or<br>
other known methods. Cells which produce Ig derived proteins with the desired specificity can be<br>
selected by a suitable assay (e.g., ELISA).<br>
Other suitable methods of producing or isolating antibodies of the requisite specificity can be<br>
used, including, but not limited to, methods that select recombinant antibody from a peptide or protein<br>

Methods for humanizing non-human Ig derived proteins can also be used and are well known<br>
in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it<br>
from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as<br>
"import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be<br>
essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature 321:522<br><br>
(1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534 (1988), each of<br>
which is entirely incorporated herein by reference), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences<br>
for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" Ig derived<br>
proteir s are chimeric Ig derived proteins (Cabilly et al., supra), wherein substantially less than an<br>
intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human<br>
species. In practice, humanized Ig derived proteins are typically human Ig derived proteins in which<br>
some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in<br>
rodent Ig derived proteins.<br>
The choice of human variable domains, bom light and heavy, to be used in making the<br>
humanized Ig derived proteins can be used to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-<br>
fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire<br>
library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of<br>
the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J.<br>
Immunol. 151:2296 (1993); Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901 (1987), each of which is entirely<br>
incorporated herein by reference). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the<br>
consensus sequence of all human Ig derived proteins of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains.<br>
The same framework can be used for several different humanized Ig derived proteins (Carter et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J. Immunol. 151:2623 (1993), each of<br>
which is entirely incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Ig derived proteins can also optionally be humanized with retention of high affinity for the<br>
antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred<br>
method, humanized Ig derived proteins are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences<br>
and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of die parental and<br>
humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are<br>
familiar to those skilled in the art Computer programs are available which illustrate and display<br>
probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin<br>
sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the<br>
functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the<br>
ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected<br>
and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic,<br>
such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are<br>
directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.<br>
Human monoclonal Ig derived proteins can be made by the hybridoma method. Human<br>
myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal Ig<br>
derived proteins have been described, for example, by Kozbor, J. Immunol. 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur<br>
st al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker,<br>
Inc., New York, 1987); and Boemer et al., J. Immunol. 147:86 (1991% each of which is entirely<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alternatively, phage display technology and, as presented above, can be used to produce<br>
human Ig derived proteins and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V)<br>
domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to one none limiting example of this<br>
technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein<br>
gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody<br>
fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-<br>
stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on die functional properties of the<br>
antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding die antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus,<br>
the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of<br>
formats; for their review see, e.g., Johnson et al., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564 (1993),<br>
each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference. Several sources of V-gene segments can<br>
be used for phage display. Clackson et al., Nature 352:624 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-<br>
oxazolone Ig derived proteins from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the<br>
spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be<br>
constructed and Ig derived proteins to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be<br>
isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581 (1991),<br>
or Griffith et al., EMBO J. 12:725 (1993), each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic<br>
hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying<br>
high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during<br>
subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique<br>
known as "chain shuffling" (Marks et al., Bio/Technol. 10:779 (1992)). In this method, the affinity of<br>
"primary" human Ig derived proteins obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially<br>
replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants<br>
(repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows die<br>
production of Ig derived proteins and antibody fragments with affinities in the nM range. A strategy<br>
for making very large phage antibody repertoires has been described by Waterhouse et al., Nucl.<br>
Acids Res. 21:2265 (1993). Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human Ig derived proteins from<br>
rodent Ig derived proteins, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the<br>
starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as "epitope imprinting,"<br>
the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent Ig derived proteins obtained by phage display<br>
technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras.<br>
Selection with antigen results in isolation of human variable capable of restoring a functional antigen-<br>
binding site, i.e., the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in<br>
order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT WO<br>
93/06213, published 1 April 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent Ig derived proteins by<br><br>
CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human Ig derived proteins, which have no<br>
framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.<br>
Bispecific Ig derived proteins can also be used that are monoclonal, preferably human or<br>
humanized. Ig derived proteins mat have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In<br>
die present case, one of the binding specificities is for at least one IL-23p40 protein, the other one is<br>
for any other antigen. For example, bispecific Ig derived proteins specifically binding a IL-23p40<br>
protein and. at least one neurotrophic factor, or two different types of IL-23p40 polypeptides are<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Methods for making bispecific Ig derived proteins are known in the art Traditionally, the<br>
recombinant production of bispecific Ig derived proteins is based on the co-expression of two<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where me two heavy chains have different specificities<br>
(Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305:537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin<br>
heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different<br>
antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the<br>
correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and<br>
the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/D8829 published 13 May<br>
1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J. 10:3655 (1991), entirely incorporated herein by referece.<br>
According to a different and more preferred approach, antibody-variable domains with the<br>
desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin<br>
constant-domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant<br>
domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, the second heavy chain constant region (C.sub.H 2), and<br>
the third heavy chain constant region (C.sub.H 3). It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain<br>
constant region (C.sub.H 1), containing the site necessary for light-chain binding, present in at least<br>
one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the<br>
immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into<br>
a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the<br>
three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used<br>
in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences<br>
for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the production of at least two<br>
polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular<br>
significance. In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific Ig derived proteins are<br>
composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a<br>
hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the<br>
other aim. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound<br>
from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light<br>
chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. For further<br>
details of generating bispecific Ig derived proteins, see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in<br><br>
Enzymology 121:210 (1986).<br>
Heteroconjugate Ig derived proteins are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Heteroconjugate Ig derived proteins are composed of two covalently joined Ig derived proteins. Such<br>
Ig derived proteins have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells<br>
(U.S. Pat No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360; WO 92/00373; and EP<br>
03089). Heteroconjugate Ig derived proteins can be made using any convenient cross-linking<br>
methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat No.<br>
4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least one anti-IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion<br>
or variant of the present invention is produced by a cell line, a mixed cell line, an immortalized cell or<br>
clonal population of immortalized cells. Immortalized IL-23p40 producing cells can be produced<br>
using suitable methods, for example, fusion of a human Ig derived protein-producing cell and a<br>
heteromyeloma or immortalization of an activated human B cell via infection with Epstein Barr virus<br>
(Niedbala et al, Hybridoma, 77(3):299-304 (1998); Zanella et aL, J Immunol Methods, /Jd(2):205-<br>

the human anti-human IL-23p40 proteins or fragments or specified portions or variants is generated<br>
by immunization of a transgenic animal (e.g., mouse, rat, hamster, non-human primate, and the like)<br>
capable of producing a repertoire of human Ig derived proteins, as described herein and/or as known<br>
in the art. Cells that produce a human anti-IL-23p40 Ig derived protein can be isolated from such<br>

comprising DNA from at least one human immunoglobulin locus that is functionally rearranged, or<br>
which can undergo functional rearrangement. The endogenous immunoglobulin loci in such mice can<br>
be disrupted or deleted to eliminate the capacity of the animal to produce Ig derived proteins encoded<br>
b&gt; endogenous genes.<br><br>
The term "functionally rearranged," as used herein refers to a segment of DNA from an<br>
immunoglobulin locus that has undergone V(D)J recombination, thereby producing an<br>
immunoglobulin gene that encodes an immunoglobulin chain (e.g., heavy chain, light chain), or any<br>
portion thereof. A functionally rearranged immunoglobulin gene can be directly or indirectly<br>
identified using suitable methods, such as, for example, nucleotide sequencing, hybridization (e.g.,<br>
Southern blotting. Northern blotting) using probes that can anneal to coding joints between gene<br>
segments or enzymatic amplification of immunoglobulin genes (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) with<br>
primers that can anneal to coding joints between gene segments. Whether a cell produces an Ig<br>
derived protein comprising a particular variable region or a variable region comprising a particular<br>
sequence (e.g., at least one CDR sequence) can also be determined using suitable methods. In one<br>
example, mRNA can be isolated from an Ig derived protein-producing cell (e.g., a hybridoma or<br>
recombinant cell or other suitable source) and used to produce cDNA encoding the Ig derived protein<br>
or specified portion or variant thereof. The cDNA can be cloned and sequenced or can be amplified<br>
(e.g., by polymerase chain reaction or other known and suitable methods) using a first primer that<br>
anneals specifically to a portion of the variable region of interest (e.g., CDR, coding joint) and a<br>
second primer that anneals specifically to non-variable region sequences (e.g., CH1, VH).<br>
Screening Ig derived protein or specified portion or variants for specific binding to similar<br>
proteins or fragments can be conveniently achieved using peptide display libraries. This method involves<br>
(he screening of large collections of peptides for individual members having the desired function or<br>
structure. Ig derived protein screening of peptide display libraries is well known in the art The displayed<br>
peptide sequences can be from 3 to 5000 or more amino acids in length, frequently from 5-100 amino<br>
acids long, and often from about 8 to 25 amino acids long. In addition to direct chemical synthetic<br>
methods for generating peptide libraries, several recombinant DNA methods have been described. One<br>
type involves the display of a peptide sequence on the surface of a bacteriophage or cell. Each<br>
bacteriophage or cell contains the nucleotide sequence encoding the particular displayed peptide<br>
sequence. Such methods are described in PCT Patent Publication Nos. 91/17271,91/18980,91/19818,<br>
and 93/08278. Other systems for generating libraries of peptides have aspects of both in vitro chemical<br>
synthesis and recombinant methods. See, PCT Patent Publication Nos. 92/05258,92/14843, and<br>

nucleic acid to provide transgenic plants and cultured plant cells (e.g., but not limited to, tobacco and<br>
maize) that produce such Ig derived proteins, specified portions or variants in the plant parts or in<br>
cells cultured therefrom. As a non-limiting example, transgenic tobacco leaves expressing<br>
recombinant proteins have been successfully used to provide large amounts of recombinant proteins,<br>
e.g., using art inducible promoter. See, e.g., Cramer et al., Curr. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240:95-118<br>

proteins at commercial production levels, with biological activities equivalent to those produced in<br>
other recombinant systems or purified from natural sources. See, e.g., Hood et al., Adv. Exp. Med.<br>
Biol. 464:127-147 (1999) and references cited therein. Ig derived proteins have also been produced in<br>
large amount;; from transgenic plant seeds including Ig derived protein fragments, such as single chain<br>
Ig derived proteins (scFv's), including tobacco seeds and potato tubers. See, e.g., Conrad et al., Plant<br>

to known methods. See also, e.g., Fischer et al., Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30:99-108 (Oct., 1999),<br>

The Ig derived proteins of the invention can bind human IL-23p40 proteins or fragments with<br>
a. wide range of affinities (KD)- In a preferred embodiment, at least one human mAb of the present<br>
invention can optionally bind human IL-23p40 proteins or fragments with high affinity. For example,<br>
a human mAb can bind human EL-23p40 proteins or fragments with a KD equal to or less than about<br>
10 ' M or, more preferably, with a KD equal to or less than about 0.1-9.9 (or any range or value<br>
therein) X 10"lc M, 10"", 10'12,10"13or any range or value therein.<br>
The affinity or avidity of an Ig derived protein for an antigen can be determined<br>
experimentally using any suitable method. (See, for example, Berzofsky, et al., "Ig derived protein-<br>
Antigen Interactions," In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press: New York, NY<br>
(1984); Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, NY (1992); and methods<br>
described herein). The measured affinity of a particular Ig derived protein-antigen interaction can<br><br>
vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH). Thus, measurements of<br>
affinity and other antigen-binding parameters (e.g., KD, Ka, Kd) are preferably made with standardized<br>
solutions of ]g derived protein and antigen, and a standardized buffer, such as the buffer described<br>
herein.<br>
Nucleic Acid Molecules<br>
Using the information provided herein, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention<br>
encoding at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant can be obtained using<br>

Nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be in me form of RNA, such as mRNA,<br>
hnRNA, tRNA or any other form, or in the form of DNA, including, but not limited to, cDNA and<br>
genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically, or any combinations thereof. The DNA<br>
can be triple-si randed, double-stranded or single-stranded, or any combination thereof. Any portion<br>
of at least one strand of the DNA or RNA can be the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or<br>
; t can be the non-coding strand, also referred to as the anti-sense strand.<br>
Isolated nucleic acid molecules of die present invention can include nucleic acid molecules<br>
c omprising an open reading frame (ORF), optionally with one or more introns, e.g., but not limited to,<br>
jit least one specified portion of at least one CDR, as CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 of at least one heavy<br>

23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant; and nucleic acid molecules which comprise a<br>
nucleotide sequence substantially different from those described above but which, due to the<br>
degeneracy of die genetic code, still encode at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein as described<br>
h'irein and/or as known in the art. Of course, the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus, it<br>
would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate nucleic acid variants that code<br>
for specific EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variants of the present invention. See,<br>

acid encoding a IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant can include, but are not<br>
limited to, those encoding the amino acid sequence of an Ig derived protein fragment, by itself; the<br>
coding sequence for the entire Ig derived protein or a portion thereof; the coding sequence for an Ig<br>
derived protein, fragment or portion, as well as additional sequences, such as the coding sequence of<br>
at east one signal leader or fusion peptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding<br>
secfuonces, such as at least one intron, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including but<br>
noi limited to, non-coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as the transcribed, non-translated sequences that<br>
play a role in transcription, mRNA processing, including splicing and polyadenylation signals (for<br>
example - ribosome binding and stability of mRNA); an additional coding sequence that codes for<br>
additional amino acids, such as those that provide additional functionalities. Thus, the sequence<br><br>
encoding an Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant can be fused to a marker sequence, such<br>
as a sequence encoding a peptide that facilitates purification of the fused Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant comprising an Ig derived protein fragment or portion.<br>
Polynucleotides Which Selectively Hybridize to a Polynucleotide as Described Herein<br>
The present invention provides isolated nucleic acids that hybridize under selective hybridization<br>
conditions to a polynucleotide encoding a IL-23p40 Ig derived protein of the present invention. Thus, the<br>
polynucleotides of this embodiment can be used for isolating, detecting, and/or quantifying nucleic acids<br>
comprising such polynucleotides. For example, polynucleotides of the present invention can be used to<br>
identify, isolate, or amplify partial or full-length clones in a deposited library. In some embodiments, the<br>
polynucleotides are genomic or cDNA sequences isolated, or otherwise complementary to, a cDNA from<br>
a human or mammalian nucleic acid library.<br>
Preferably, the cDNA library comprises at least 80% full-length sequences, preferably, at least<br>
J'i5% or 90% fud-lengm sequences, and, more preferably, at least 95% full-length sequences. The cDNA<br>
libraries can be normalized to increase the representation of rare sequences. Low or moderate stringency<br>
hybridization conditions are typically, but not exclusively, employed with sequences having a reduced<br>
sequence identity relative to complementary sequences. Moderate and high stringency conditions can<br>
optionally be employed for sequences of greater identity. Low stringency conditions allow selective<br>
h ybridization of sequences having about 70% sequence identity and can be employed to identify<br>
orthologous or paralogous sequences.<br>
Optionally, polynucleotides of this invention will encode at least a portion of an Ig derived<br>
protein or specified portion or variant encoded by the polynucleotides described herein. The<br>
polynucleotides of this invention embrace nucleic acid sequences that can be employed for selective<br>
hybridization to a polynucleotide encoding an Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the<br>
present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; Colligan, supra, each entirely incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Construction of Nucleic Adds<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be made using (a) recombinant methods,<br>
(b) synthetic techniques, (c) purification techniques, or combinations thereof, as well-known in the art<br>
The nucleic acids can conveniently comprise sequences in addition to a polynucleotide of the<br>
present invention. For example, a multi-cloning site comprising one or more endonuclease restriction<br>
sites can be inserted into the nucleic acid to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide. Also, translatable<br>
sequences can be inserted to aid in the isolation of the translated polynucleotide of the present invention.<br>
For example, a hexa-histidine marker sequence provides a convenient means to purify the proteins of the<br>
present invention. The nucleic acid of the present invention - excluding the coding sequence - is<br><br>
optionally a vector, adapter, or linker for cloning and/or expression of a polynucleotide of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Additional sequences can be added to such cloning and/or expression sequences to optimize their<br>
function in cloning and/or expression, to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide, or to improve the<br>
introduction of the polynucleotide into a cell. Use of cloning vectors, expression vectors, adapters, and<br>
linkers is well known in the art. (See, e-g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra)<br>
Recombinant Methods for Constructing Nucleic Adds<br>
The isolated nucleic acid compositions of this invention, such as RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, or<br>
any combinab on feereof, can be obtained from biological sources using any number of cloning<br>
methodologies known to those of skill in the art In some embodiments, oligonucleotide probes mat<br>
selectively hybridize, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotides of the present invention are used<br>
to identify fee desired sequence in a cDNA or genomic DNA library. The isolation of RNA, and<br>
construction of cDNA and genomic libraries, is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (See, eg.,<br>
Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra)<br>
Nucleic Acid Screening and Isolation Methods<br>
A cDN A or genomic library can be screened using a probe based upon the sequence of a<br>
polynucleotide of the present invention, such as those disclosed herein. Probes can be used to hybridize<br>
with genomic DNA or cDNA sequences to isolate homologous genes in the same or different organisms.<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate mat various degrees of stringency of hybridization can be<br>
e mployed in the assay; and either fee hybridization or fee wash medium can be stringent As the<br>
conditions for hybridization become more stringent, there must be a greater degree of complementarity<br>
between fee probe and the target for duplex formation to occur. The degree of stringency can be<br>
controlled by one or more of temperature, ionic strength, pH and the presence of a partially denaturing<br>
solvent such as formamide. For example, fee stringency of hybridization is conveniently varied by<br>
changing the polarity of fee reactant solution through, for example, manipulation of fee concentration of<br>
formamide within the range of 0% to 50%. The degree of complementarity (sequence identity) required<br>
for detectable binding will vary in accordance with fee stringency of fee hybridization medium and/or<br>
wash medium. The degree of complementarity will optimally be 100%, or 90-100%, or any range or<br>
viilue therein. However, it should be understood feat minor sequence variations in the probes and primers<br>
can be compensated for by reducing fee stringency of the hybridization and/or wash medium.<br>
Method;; of amplification of RNA or DNA are well known in the art and can be used<br>
according to the present invention without undue experimentation, based on the teaching and<br>
guidance presented herein.<br>
Known methods of DNA or RNA amplification include, but are not limited to, polymerase<br>
chain reaction (PCR) and related amplification processes (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195,<br><br>
4,683,202,4,300,159,4,965,188, to Mullis, et al.; 4,795,699 and 4,921,794 to Tabor, et al; 5,142,033<br>
to Innis; 5,122,464 to Wilson, et al.; 5,091,310 to lnnis; 5,066,584 to Gyllensten, et al; 4,889,818 to<br>
Gelfand, et al; 4,994,370 to Silver, et al; 4,766,067 to Biswas; 4,656,134 to Ringold) and RNA<br>
mediated amplification that uses anti-sense RNA to the target sequence as a template for double-<br>
stranded DNA synthesis (U.S. Patent No. 5,130,238 to Malek, et al, with the tradename NASBA), the<br>
entire contents of which references are incorporated herein by reference. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or<br>
Sambrook, supra.)<br>
For instance, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology can be used to amplify the sequences<br>
of polynucleotides of the present invention and related genes direcdy from genomic DNA or cDNA<br>
libraries. PCR and other in vitro amplification methods can also be useful, for example, to clone nucleic<br>
acid sequences that code for proteins to be expressed, to make nucleic acids to use as probes for detecting<br>
the presence of the desired mRNA in samples, for nucleic acid sequencing, or for other purposes.<br>
Examples of techniques sufficient to direct persons of skill through in vitro amplification methods are<br>
[bund in Berger, supra, Sambrook, supra, and Ausubel, supra, as well as Mullis, et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,683,202 (1987); and Innis, et al., PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications, Eds., Academic<br>
Press Inc., San Diego, CA (1990). Commercially available kits for genomic PCR amplification are<br>
known in the ait. See, e.g., Advantage-GC Genomic PCR Kit (Clontech). The T4 gene 32 protein<br>
(Boehringer Miinnheim) can be used to improve yield of long PCR products.<br>
Synthetic Methods for Constructing Nucleic Adds<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can also be prepared by direct chemical<br>
s ynthesis by known methods (see, e.g., Ausubel, et al., supra). Chemical synthesis generally produces a<br>
smgle-stranded oligonucleotide, which can be converted into double-stranded DNA by hybridization with<br>
a complementary sequence, or by polymerization with a DNA polymerase using the single strand as a<br>
template. One of skill in the art will recognize that while chemical synthesis of DNA can be Hrnited to<br>
sequences of about 100 or more bases, longer sequences can be obtained by the ligation of shorter<br>
sequences.<br>
Recombinant Expression Cassettes<br>
The present invention further provides recombinant expression cassettes comprising a nucleic<br>
ac id of the present invention. A nucleic acid sequence of the present invention, for example, a cDNA or a<br>
genomic sequence encoding an Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present invention,<br>
can be used to construct a recombinant expression cassette that can be introduced into at least one desired<br>
host cell. A recombinant expression cassette will typically comprise a polynucleotide of die present<br>
invention operably linked to transcriptional initiation regulatory sequences that will direct the<br>
transcription of die polynucleotide in the intended host cell. Both heterologous and non-heterologous<br><br>
(i .e., endogenous) promoters can be employed to direct expression of the nucleic acids of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In some embodiments, isolated nucleic acids mat serve as promoter, enhancer, or other elements<br>
can be introduced in the appropriate position (upstream, downstream or in intron) of a non-heterologous<br>
form of a poly nucleotide of the present invention so as to up or down regulate expression of a<br>
polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, endogenous promoters can be altered in vivo or in<br>
vitro by mutation, deletion and/or substitution.<br>
A polynucleotide of the present invention can be expressed in either sense or anti-sense<br>
orientation as desired. It will be appreciated that control of gene expression in either sense or anti-sense<br>
orientation can have a direct impact on the observable characteristics.<br>
Another method of suppression is sense suppression. Introduction of nucleic acid configured in<br>
tiie sense orientation has been shown to be an effective means by which to block the transcription of<br>
target genes.<br>
A variety of cross-linking agents, alkylating agents and radical generating species as pendant<br>
groups on polynucleotides of the present invention can be used to bind, label, detect and/or cleave nucleic<br>
acids. Knorre, et al., Biochirnie 67:785-789 (1985); Vlassov, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 14:4065-4076<br>

bind, detect, label, and/or cleave nucleic acids are known in the art See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,543,507; 5,672,593; 5,484,908; 5,256,648; and 5,681941, each entirely incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Vectors And Host Cells<br>
The present invention also relates to vectors that include isolated nucleic acid molecules of<br>
the present invention, host cells that are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and the<br>
production of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant by recombinant<br>
techniques, as is well known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, et al., supra; Ausubel, et al., supra, each<br>
entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The polynucleotides can optionally be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for<br>
propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium<br>
phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it can be packaged<br>
in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.<br>
The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter. The expression<br>
constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed<br>
region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed<br><br>
by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at the beginning and a termination<br>
codon (e.g., UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the raRNA to be translated,<br>
with UAA and UAG preferred for mammalian or eukaryotic cell expression.<br>
Expression vectors will preferably but optionally include at least one selectable marker. Such<br>
markers include, e.g., but not limited to, methotrexate (MTX), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, US<br>
Pat.Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; 4,656,134; 4,956,288; 5,149,636; 5,179,017, ampicillin, neomycin<br>
(G418), mycophenolic acid, or glutanrine synthetase (GS, US PatNos. 5,122,464; 5,770,359;<br>
5.827,739) resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for<br>
culturing in e. Coli and other bacteria or prokaryotics (the above patents are entirely incorporated<br>
hereby by reference). Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells<br>
are known in the art. Suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Introduction of a<br>
vector construct into a host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran<br>
mediated transfection, canonic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or<br>
other known methods. Such methods ate described in the art, such as Sambrook, supra. Chapters 1-4<br>
and 16-18; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 1,9,13,15,16.<br>
At least one Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present invention can be<br>
expressed in a modified form, such as a flision protein, and can include not only secretion signals, but<br>
aJso additional heterologous functional regions. For instance, a region of additional amino acids,<br>
particularly charged amino acids, can be added to the N-terminus of an Ig derived protein or specified<br>
portion or variant to improve stability and persistence in the host cell, daring purification, or during<br>
subsequent handling and storage. Also, peptide moieties can be added to an Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant of the present invention to facilitate purification. Such regions can be<br>
removed prior to final preparation of an Ig derived protein or at least one fragment thereof. Such<br>
methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Chapters<br>
17 29-17.42 and .18.1-18.74; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 16,17 and 18.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are knowledgeable in the numerous expression systems<br>
available for expression of a nucleic acid encoding a protein of the present invention.<br>
Alternatively, nucleic acids of the present invention can be expressed in a host cell by turning on<br>
(by manipulation) in a host cell that contains endogenous DNA encoding an Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant of the present invention. Such methods are well known in the art, e.g., as<br>
described in US patent Nos. 5,580,734,5,641,670,5,733,746, and 5,733,761, entirely incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
IIusirative of cell cultures useful for the production of the Ig derived proteins, specified portions<br>
or vsaiants thereof, are mammalian cells. Mammalian cell systems often will be in the form of<br>
monolayers of cells although mammalian cell suspensions or bioreactors can also be used. A number of<br>
suitable host cell lines capable of expressing intact glycosylated proteins have been developed in fee art,<br>
and include the COS-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL1650), COS-7 (e.g., ATCC CRL651), HEK293, BHK21<br><br>
(e.g., ATCC CRL-10), CHO (e.g., ATCC CRL1610) and BSC-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL-26) cell lines, Cos-7<br>
cells, CHO cells, hep G2 cells, P3X63Ag8.653, SP2/0-Agl4, 293 cells, HeLa cells and the like, which<br>
are readily available from, for example, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Preferred<br>
host cells include cells of lymphoid origin such as myeloma and lymphoma cells. Particularly<br>
preferred host cells are P3X63Ag8.653 cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1580) and SP2/0-Agl4<br>
cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1851). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
recombinant cell is a P3X63Ab8.653 or a SP2/D-Agl4 cell.<br>
Expression vectors for these cells can include one or more of the following expression control<br>
sequences, such as, but not limited to, an origin of replication; a promoter (e.g., late or early SV40<br>
promoters, the CMV promoter (US PatNos. 5,168,062; 5,385,839), an HSV tk promoter, a pgk<br>
(phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, an EF-1 alpha promoter (US PatNo. 5,266,491), at least one human<br>
immunoglobulin promoter, an enhancer, and/or processing information sites, such as ribosome binding<br>
sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites (e.g., an SV40 large T Ag poly A addition site), and<br>
transcriptional terminator sequences. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., supra; Sambrook, et aL, supra. Other cells<br>
useful for production of nucleic acids or proteins of the present invention are known and/or available, for<br>
instance, from the American Type Culture Collection Catalogue of Cell Lines and Hybridomas<br>
i www.atcc.org) or other known or commercial sources.<br>
When eukaryotic host cells are employed, polyadenlyation or transcription terminator sequences<br>
arc typically incorporated into the vector. An example of a terminator sequence is the polyadenlyation<br>
sequence from the bovine growth hormone gene. Sequences for accurate splicing of the transcript can<br>
a Iso be included. An example of a splicing sequence is the VP1 intron from SV40 (Sprague, et al., J.<br>
Virol. 45:773-781 (1983)). Additionally, gene sequences to control replication in the host cell can be<br>
incorporated into the vector, as known in the art.<br>
Purification of an Ig derived protein or Specified Portion or Variant Thereof<br>
An IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant can be recovered and purified<br>
from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including, but not limited to, protein A<br>
purification, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange<br>
chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography,<br>
affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. High<br>
peiformance liquid chromatography ("HPLC") can also be employed for purification. See e.g.,<br>
Colbgan, Current Protocols in Immunology, or Current Protocols in Protein Science, John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons. NY, NY, (1997-2003), e.g., Chapters 1,4,6,8,9,10, each entirely incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Ig derived proteins or specified portions or variants of the present invention include naturally<br>
purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant<br>
techniques from a eukaryotic host, including, for example, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian<br><br>
cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the Ig derived<br>
protem or specified portion or variant of the present invention can be giycosylated or can be non-<br>
glycosylated, with glycosylated preferred. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory<br>
manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Sections 17.37-17.42; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 10,12,13,16,18<br>
and 20, Coliigan, Protein Science, supra, Chapters 12-14, all entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
IL-23P40 Ig DERIVED PROTEINS, FRAGMENTS AND/OR VARIANTS<br>
The isolated Ig derived proteins of the present invention comprise an Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant encoded by any one of the polynucleotides of the present invention, as<br>
discussed more fully herein, or any isolated or prepared Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
thereof.<br>
Preferably, the human Ig derived protein or antigen-binding fragment binds human IL-23p40<br>
proteins or fragments and, thereby substantially neutralizes the biological activity of the protein. An<br>
Ig derived protein, or specified portion or variant thereof, that partially or preferably substantially<br>
neu tralizes at least one biological activity of at least one IL23p40 protein or fragment can bind the<br>
protem or fragment and thereby inhibit activities mediated through the binding of IL-23p40 to at least<br>
one lL-23p40 receptor or through other IL-23p40-dependent or mediated mechanisms. As used<br>
herein, the term "neutralizing Ig derived protein" refers to an Ig derived protein mat can inhibit human<br>
p40 or pl9 protem or fragment related-dependent activity by about 20-120%, preferably, by at least<br>
about 60,70,80,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100% or more depending on the assay. The<br>
capacity of anti-human E^23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant to inhibit human<br>
BL-:'.3p40 related-dependent activity is preferably assessed by at least one suitable EL-23p40 Ig<br>
derived protein or protein assay, as described herein and/or as known in the art A human Ig derived<br>
prott an or specified portion or variant of the invention can be of any class (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD,<br>
etc.) or isotype and can comprise a kappa or lambda light chain. In one embodiment, the human Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant comprises an IgG heavy chain or defined fragment, for<br>
example, at least one of isotypes, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4. Ig derived proteins of mis type can be<br>
prepared by emplo} ing a transgenic mouse or other trangenic non-human mammal comprising at least<br>
one human light chain (e.g., IgG, IgA and IgM (e.g., yl, Y2. Y3. Y4 transgenes as described herein<br>
and/oi as known in she art. In another embodiment, the anti-human IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant thereof comprises an IgGl heavy chain and an IgGl Mght chain.<br>
At least one Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the invention binds at least<br>
one spmfied epitope specific to at least one IL-23p40 protein, subunit, fragment, portion or any<br>
combination thereof. The at least one epitope can comprise at least one Ig derived protein binding<br>
region that comprises at least one portion of said protein, which epitope is preferably comprised of at<br>
least one extracellular soluble, hydrophillic, external or cytoplasmic portion of said protein. As non-<br>
limiting examples, (a) a IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant specifically binds<br><br>
at least one epitope comprising at least 1-3, to the entire amino acid sequence, selected from the group<br>
consisting of at least one p40 subunit of human IL-23. The at least one specified epitope can<br>
comprise any combination of at least one amino acid of the p40 subunit of a human interieukin-23,<br>
such as, but not limited to, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 or 14 amino acids of at least one of, 1-<br>
10,10-20, 20-30,30-40,40-50,50-60,60-70,70-80,80-90,90-100,100-110,110-120,120-130,130-<br>

156-175, 194-204,208-246,254-273,279-281, or 289-300 of SEQ ID NO:l.<br>
Generally, the human Ig derived protein or antigen-binding fragment of the present invention<br>
will comprise an antigen-binding region that comprises at least one human complementarity<br>
determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) or variant of at least one heavy chain variable region<br>
and at least one human complementarity determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) or variant of<br>
at least one light chain variable region. As a non-limiting example, the Ig derived protein or antigen-<br>
binding portion or variant can comprise at least one of the heavy chain CDR3, and/or a light chain<br>
CDR3. In a particular embodiment, the Ig derived protein or antigen-binding fragment can have an<br>
antigen-binding region that comprises at least a portion of at least one heavy chain CDR (i.e., CDR1,<br>
CDR2 and/or CDR3) having the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDRs 1,2 and/or 3. In<br>
another particular embodiment, the Ig derived protein or antigen-binding portion or variant can have<br>
an antigen-binding region that comprises at least a portion of at least one light chain CDR (i.e., CDR1,<br>
GDR2 and/or CDR3) having the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDRs 1,2 and/or 3. Such<br>
Ig derived proteins can be prepared by chemically joining together the various portions (e.g., CDRs,<br>
framework) of the Ig derived protein using conventional techniques, by preparing and expressing a<br>
(i.e., one or more) nucleic acid molecule that encodes the Ig derived protein using conventional<br>
techniques of recombinant DNA technology or by using any other suitable method.<br>
The anti-IL-23p40 Ig derived protein can comprise at least one of a heavy or light chain<br>
variable region having a defined amino acid sequence. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
ann-IL-23p40 Ig derived protein comprises at least one of at least one heavy chain variable region<br>
and/or at least one light chain variable region. Human Ig derived proteins that bind to human IL-<br>
23p40 proteins; or fragments and that comprise a defined heavy or light chain variable region can be<br>
prepared using suitable methods, such as phage display (Katsube, Y., et al, bit J Mol. Med, 1(5):863-<br>
868 (1998)) or mediods that employ transgenic animals, as known in the art and/or as described<br>
herein. For example, a transgenic mouse, comprising a functionally rearranged human<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain transgene and a transgene comprising DNA from a human<br>
Immunoglobulin light chain locus that can undergo functional rearrangement, can be immunized with<br>
human IL-23p40 proteins or fragments thereof to elicit the production of Ig derived proteins. If<br>
dssired, the Ig derived protein producing cells can be isolated and hybridomas or other immortalized<br>
Ig; derived protein-producing cells can be prepared as described herein and/or as known in the art.<br><br>
Alternatively, the Ig derived protein, specified portion or variant can be expressed using the encoding<br>
nucleic acid or portion thereof in a suitable host cell.<br>
The invention also relates to Ig derived proteins, antigen-binding fragments, immunoglobulin<br>
chains and CDRs comprising amino acids in a sequence that is substantially the same as an amino<br>
acid sequence described herein. Preferably, such Ig derived proteins or antigen-binding fragments<br>
and Ig derived proteins comprising such chains or CDRs can bind human IL-23p40 proteins or<br>
fragments with high affinity (e.g., KD less man or equal to about 10*9 M). Amino acid sequences that<br>
are substantially the same as the sequences described herein include sequences comprising<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as amino acid deletions and/or insertions. A<br>
conservat ve amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of a first amino acid by a second amino<br>
acid that has chemical and/or physical properties (e.g., charge, structure, polarity,<br>
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) that are similar to those of the first amino acid. Conservative<br>
substitutions include replacement of one amino acid in a group by another within the same group as in<br>
the following groups: lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H); aspartate (D) and glutamate (E);<br>
asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), K, R, H, D and E; alanine (A),<br>
valine (V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), methionine (M),<br>
cysteine (C) and glycine (G); F, W and Y; C, S and T.<br>
Amino Acid Codes<br>
The amino acids that make up IL-23p40 Ig derived proteins or specified portions or variants<br>
of the present invention are often abbreviated. The amino acid designations can be indicated by<br>
designating the amino acid by its single letter code, its three letter code, name, or three nucleotide<br>
codon(s) as in well understood in the art (see Alberts, B., et al., Molecular Biology of The Cell, Third<br>
Ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, 1994):<br><br><br><br>
An IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present invention can<br>
include one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, either from natural mutations or<br>
human manipulation, as specified herein.<br>
Of course, the number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make depends on<br>
many factors, including those described above. Generally speaking, the number of amino acid<br>
substitutions, insertions or deletions for any given IL-23p40 polypeptide will not be more than 40,30,<br>
20,19,18,17, 16,15,14,13,12,11,10, 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, such as 1-30 or any range or value<br>
Therein, as specified herein.<br>
Amino acids in an IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present<br>
invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-<br>
directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (e.g., Ausubel, supra, Chapters 8,15;<br>
Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081-1085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single<br>
alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for<br>
biological activity, such as, but not limited to, at least one IL-23p40 neutralizing activity. Sites that<br>
aie critical for Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant binding can also be identified by<br>
structural analysis, such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling<br>
(Smith, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:899-904 (1992) and de Vos, et al., Science 255:306-312 (1992)).<br>
The Ig derived proteins or specified portions or variants of the present invention, or specified<br>
variants thereof, can comprise any number of contiguous amino acid residues from an Ig derived protein<br>
or specified portion or variant of the present invention, wherein mat number is selected from the group of<br>
integers consisting of from 10-100% of the number of contiguous residues in an EL-23p40 Ig derived<br>
pnrtein or specified portion or variant. Optionally, this subsequence of contiguous amino acids is at least<br>
ab)ur 10,20, 30,40,50,60,70, 80,90,100,110,120,130,140,150,160,170,180,190,200,210,220,<br>
23(), 240,250 or more amino acids in length, or any range or value therein. Further, the number of such<br>
sut»sequences can be any integer selected from the group consisting of from 1 to 20, such as at least 2,3,<br>
4, or 5.<br>
As those of skill will appreciate, the present invention includes at least one biologically active Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present invention. Biologically active Ig derived<br>
pro: eins or specifi<jd portions or variants have a specific activity at least and></jd><br>
preferably at least 50%, 60%, or 70%, and most preferably at least 80%, 90%, or 95%-1000% of that of<br>
the native (non-synthetic), endogenous or related and known Ig derived protein or specified portion or<br>
variant Methods of assaying and quantifying measures of enzymatic activity and substrate specificity,<br>
are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to human Ig derived proteins and antigen-binding<br>
fragments, as described herein, which are modified by the covalent attachment of an organic moiety.<br>
Such modification can produce an Ig derived protein or antigen-binding fragment with improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., increased in vivo serum half-life). The organic moiety can be a<br>
linear or branched hydrophilic polymeric group, fatty acid group, or fatty acid ester group. In<br>
particular embodiments, the hydrophilic polymeric group can have a molecular weight of about 800 to<br>
about 120,000 Daltons and can be a polyalkane glycol (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG),<br>
{olypropylene glycol (PPG)), carbohydrate polymer, amino acid polymer or polyvinyl pyrolidone,<br>
and the fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can comprise from about eight to about forty carbon atoms.<br>
The modified Ig derived proteins and antigen-binding fragments of the invention can<br>
comprise one or more organic moieties that are covalendy bonded, directly or indirectly, to the Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant. Each organic moiety that is bonded to an Ig derived<br>
protein or antigen-binding fragment of the invention can independently be a hydrophilic polymeric<br>
group, a fatty acid group or a fatty acid ester group. As used herein, the term "fatty acid"<br>
encompasses mono-carboxylic acids and di-carboxylic acids. A "hydrophilic polymeric group," as<br>
the term is used herein, refers to an organic polymer that is more soluble in water than in octane. For<br>
example, polylysine is more soluble in water than in octane. Thus, an Ig derived protein modified by<br>
the covalent attachment of polylysine is encompassed by the invention. Hydrophilic polymers<br>
suitable for modifying Ig derived proteins of the invention can be linear or branched and include, for<br>
example, polyalkane glycols (e.g., PEG, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), PPG and the<br>
Iil.e), carbohydrates (e.g., dextran, cellulose, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and the like), polymers<br>
of hydrophilic amino acids (e.g., polylysine, polyargmine, polyaspartate and the like), polyalkane<br>
oxides (e.g., polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide and the like) and polyvinyl pyrolidone.<br>
Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer that modifies the Ig derived protein of the invention has a<br>
molecular weight of about 800 to about 150,000 Daltons as a separate molecular entity. For example,<br>
PEG,ooo and PEG2o,ooo. wherein the subscript is the average molecular weight of the polymer in<br>
Daltons, can be used.<br>
The hydrophilic polymeric group can be substituted with one to about six alkyl, fatty acid or<br>
fati y acid ester groups. Hydrophilic polymers that are substituted with a fatty acid or fatty acid ester<br>
group can be prepared by employing suitable methods. For example, a polymer comprising an amine<br>
group can be coupled to a carboxylate of the fatty acid or fatty acid ester, and an activated carboxylate<br>
(e.j,., activated with N, N-carbonyl diimidazole) on a fatty acid or fatty acid ester can be coupled to a<br>
hyclroxyl group on a polymer.<br><br>
Fatty acids and fatty acid esters suitable for modifying Ig derived proteins of the invention<br>
can be saturated or can contain one or more units of uasaturation. Fatty acids that are suitable for<br>
modifying Ig derived proteins of the invention include, for example, n-dodecanoate (Clz, laurate), n-<br>
tetradecanoaie (C!4, myristate), n-octadecanoate (C„, stearate), n-eicosanoate (Qo, arachidate), n-<br>
docosanoate (C22, behenate), n-triacontanoate (C30), n-tetracontanoate (C«), c«-A9-octadecanoate<br>
(Cis, oleate), all cw-A5,8,ll,14-eicosatetraenoate (CM, arachidonate), octanedioic acid,<br>
tetradecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, docosanedioic acid, and the like. Suitable fatty acid<br>
esters include mono-esters of dicarboxylic acids mat comprise a linear or branched lower alkyl group.<br>
The lower alkyl group can comprise from one to about twelve, preferably, one to about six, carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
The modified human Ig derived proteins and antigen-binding fragments can be prepared using<br>
suitable methods, such as by reaction with one or more modifying agents. A "modifying agent" as the<br>
1 erm is used herein, refers to a suitable organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, a fatty acid, a fatty<br>
acid ester) that comprises an activating group. An "activating group" is a chemical moiety or<br>
functional group that can, under appropriate conditions, react with a second chemical group thereby<br>
forming a covalent bond between (he modifying agent and the second chemical group. For example,<br>
a mine-reactive activating groups include electrophilic groups such as tosylate, mesylate, halo (chloro,<br>
bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters (NHS), and the like. Activating groups that can<br>
react with thiols include, for example, maleimide, iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, S-thiol-2-<br>
n tiobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-thiol), and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to<br>
amine- or hydrazide-containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous<br>
gioup to form phosphoraraidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce activating<br>
groups into molecules are known in the art (see, for example, Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate<br>
Teclmiques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996)). An activating group can be bonded directly to<br>
the; organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, fatty acid, fatty acid ester), or through a linker moiety,<br>
for example, a divalent Ci-Cl2 group wherein one or more carbon atoms can be replaced by a<br>
h&amp; eroatom such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Suitable linker moieties include, for example,<br>
let methylene glycol, -(CH2)r, -NH-tCH^-NH-, -(CH2)2NH- and -CHJ-O-CHJ-CHT-O-CHZ-CHZ-O-<br>
CH-NH-. Modifying agents that comprise a linker moiety can be produced, for example, by reacting<br>
a niono-Boc-alkyldiamine (e.g., mono-Boc-ethylenediamine, mono-Boc-diarninohexane) with a fatty<br>
acid in the presence of l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) to form an amide<br>
borid between the free amine and the fatty acid carboxylate. The Boc protecting group can be<br>
removed from the product by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to expose a primary amine that<br>
can be coupled to another carboxylate as described, or can be reacted with maleic anhydride and the<br>
resu king product cyclized to produce an activated maleimido derivative of the fatty acid. (See, for<br><br>
example, Thompson, et al, WO 92/16221, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.)<br>
The modified Ig derived proteins of the invention can be produced by reacting a human Ig<br>
derived protein or antigen-binding fragment with a modifying agent. For example, the organic<br>
moieties can be bonded to the Ig derived protein in a non-site specific manner by employing an<br>
amine-reactive modifying agent, for example, an NHS ester of PEG. Modified human Ig derived<br>
proteins or antigen-binding fragments can also be prepared by reducing disulfide bonds (e.g., intra-<br>
cliain disulfide bonds) of an Ig derived protein or antigen-binding fragment. The reduced Ig derived<br>
protein or antigen-binding fragment can then be reacted with a thiol-reactive modifying agent to<br>
produce the modified Ig derived protein of the invention. Modified human Ig derived proteins and<br>
antigen-binding fragments comprising an organic moiety that is bonded to specific sites of an Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present invention can be prepared using suitable<br>
methods, such as reverse proteolysis (Fisch et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 3:147-153 (1992); Werlen et<br>
al.,Bioconjugate Chem., 5:411-417 (1994); Kumaran etal. Protein Set 6(10):2233-2241 (1997); Itoh<br>
et al, Bioorg. Chem., 24(1): 59-68 (1996); Capellas et al, Biotechnol Bioeng., 56(4):456-463<br>

with the present invention can be produced by recombinant means, including from mammalian cell or<br>
transgenic preparations, or can be purified from other biological sources, as described herein or as<br>
known in the art.<br>
The range of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant in the<br>
product of the present invention includes amounts yielding upon reconstitution, if in a wet/dry system,<br>
i<br><br>
concentrations from about 1.0 jtg/ml to about 1000 mg/ml, although lower and higher concentrations<br>
are operable and are dependent on the intended delivery vehicle, e.g., solution formulations will differ<br>
from transdermal patch, pulmonary, transmucosal, or osmotic or micro pump methods.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous diluent optionally further comprises a pharmaceutical] y acceptable<br>
preservative. Preferred preservatives include those selected from the group consisting of phenol, m-<br>

provide improved pH control. The formulations can cover a wide range of pHs, such as from about<br>
pH 4 to about pH 10, and preferred ranges from about pH 5 to about pH 9, and a most preferred range<br>
of about 6.0 to about 8.0. Preferably, the formulations of the present invention have pH between<br>
about 6.8 and about 7.8. Preferred buffers include phosphate buffers, most preferably, sodium<br>
phosphate, particularly phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
Other additives, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizers like Tween 20<br>
(polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan roonolaurate), Tween 40 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan<br>
monopalmitate), Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate), Pluronic F68<br>
(polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers), and PEG (polyethylene glycol) or non-ionic<br>
surfactants, such as polysorbate 20 or 80 or poloxamer 184 or 188, Pluronic® polyls, other block co-<br>
polymers, and chelators, such as EDTA and EGTA, can optionally be added to the formulations or<br>
compositions to reduce aggregation. These additives are particularly useful if a pump or plastic<br>
container is used to administer the formulation. The presence of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
surfactant mitigates the propensity for the protein to aggregate.<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be prepared by a process which comprises<br>
mixing at least one EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant and a preservative<br>
selected from the group consisting of phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, chlorocresol, benzyl<br>
alcohol, alkylparaben, (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like), benzalkonium chloride,<br>
benzethonium chloride, sodium dehydroacetate and thimerosal or mixtures thereof in an aqueous<br>
diluen t. Mixing tli e at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant and<br>
preservative in an aqueous diluent is carried out using conventional dissolution and mixing<br>
procedures. To prepare a suitable formulation, for example, a measured amount of at least one IL-<br>
23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant in buffered solution is combined with the<br>
desired preservative in a buffered solution in quantities sufficient to provide the protein and<br><br>
preservative at the desired concentrations. Variations of this process would be recognized by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. For example, the order the components are added, whether additional<br>
additives are used, the temperature and pH at which the formulation is prepared, are all factors that<br>
may be optimized for the concentration and means of administration used.<br>
The claimed formulations can be provided to patients as clear solutions or as dual vials<br>
comprising a vial of lyophilized (at least one) TL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or<br>
variant that is reconstituted with a second vial containing water, a preservative and/or excipients,<br>
preferably, a phosphate buffer and/or saline and a chosen salt, in an aqueous diluent Either a single<br>
solution vial or dual vial requiring reconstitution can be reused multiple times and can suffice for a<br>
single or multiple cycles of patient treatment and thus can provide a more convenient treatment<br>
regimen than currently available.<br>
The present claimed articles of manufacture are useful for administration over a period of<br>
immediately to twenty-four hours or greater. Accordingly, the presently claimed articles of<br>
manufacture offer significant advantages to the patient Formulations of the invention can optionally<br>
be safely stored at temperatures of from about 2°C to about 40°C and retain the biologically activity<br>
of the protein for extended periods of time, thus allowing a package label indicating that the solution<br>
can be held and/or used over a period of 6,12,18,24,36,48,72, or 96 hours or greater. If preserved<br>
diluent is used, such label can include use up to 1-12 months, one-half, one and a half, and/or two<br>
years.<br>
The solutions of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant in the<br>
invention can be prepared by a process that comprises mixing at least one Ig derived protein or<br>

dissolution and mixing procedures. To prepare a suitable diluent, for example, a measured amount of<br>
at least one Ig; derived protein or specified portion or variant in water or buffer is combined in<br>
quantities sufficient to provide the protein and optionally a preservative or buffer at the desired<br>
concentrations. Variations of this process would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. For<br>
example, the order the components are added, whether additional additives are used, the temperature<br>
and pH at which the formulation is prepared, are all factors that may be optimized for the<br>
concentration and means of administration used.<br>
The claimed products can be provided to patients as clear solutions or as dual vials<br>

TNF antagonists suitable for compositions, combination therapy, co-administration, devices<br>
and/or methods of the present invention (further comprising at least one antibody, specified portion<br>
and variant thereof, of the present invention), include, but are not limited to, anti-TNF Ig derived<br>
proteins, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and receptor molecules which bind specifically to TNF;<br>
compounds which prevent and/or inhibit TNF synthesis, TNF release or its action on target cells, such<br>
as thalidomide, tenidap, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., pentoxifylline and rolipram), A2b<br>
adenosine receptor agonists and A2b adenosine receptor enhancers; compounds which prevent and/or<br>
inhibit TNF receptor signalling, such as mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors;<br>
compounds which block and/or inhibit membrane TNF cleavage, such as metalloproteinase inhibitors;<br>
compounds which block and/or inhibit TNF activity, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)<br>
inhibitors (e.g., captopril); and compounds which block and/or inhibit TNF production and/or<br>

As used herein, a "tumor necrosis factor Ig derived protein," "TNF Ig derived protein,"<br>
"TNFoc Ig derived protein," or fragment and the like decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or<br>
interferes with TNFa activity in vitro, in situ and/or preferably in vivo. For example, a suitable TNF<br>
human Ig derived protein of the present invention can bind TNFa and includes anti-TNF Ig derived<br>
proteins, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and specified mutants or domains thereof that bind<br>
specifically to TNFa. A suitable TNF antibody or fragment can also decrease block, abrogate,<br>
interfere, prevent and/or inhibit TNF RNA, DNA or protein synthesis, TNF release, TNF receptor<br>
signaling, membrane TNF cleavage, TNF activity, TNF production and/or synthesis.<br>
Chimeric Ig derived protein cA2 consists of. the antigen binding variable region of the high-<br>
affinity neutralizing mouse anti-human TNFa IgGl Ig derived protein, designated A2, and the<br>
constant regions of a human IgGl, kappa immunoglobulin. The human IgGl Fc region improves<br>
allogeneic Ig derived protein effector function, increases the circulating serum half-life and decreases<br>
the immunogenicity of the Ig derived protein. The avidity and epitope specificity of the chimeric Ig<br>
derived protein cA2 is derived from the variable region of the murine Ig derived protein A2. In a<br>
particular embodiment, a preferred source for nucleic acids encoding the variable region of the murine<br>
[g derived protein A2 is the A2 hybridoma cell line.<br><br>
Chimeric A2 (cA2) neutralizes the cytotoxic effect of both natural and recombinant human<br>
TNFα in a dose dependent manner. From binding assays of chimeric Ig derived protein cA2 and<br>
recombinant human TNFa, the affinity constant of chimeric Ig derived protein cA2 was calculated to<br>
be 1.04xl0^M-1. Preferred methods for determining monoclonal Ig derived protein specificity and<br>
affinity by competitive inhibition can be found in Harlow, et al, Ig derived proteins: A Laboratory<br>
Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1988; Colligan etal.,<br>

In a particular embodiment, murine monoclonal Ig derived protein A2 is produced by a cell<br>
line designated cl34A. Chimeric Ig derived protein cA2 is produced by a cell line designated cl68A.<br>

TNF Receptor Molecules<br>
Preferred TNF receptor molecules useful in the present invention are those that bind TNFa<br>
with high affinity (see, e.g., Feldmann etal.. International Publication No. WO 92/07076 (published<br>
April 30,1992); Schall et al, Cett 67:361-370 (1990); and Loetscher et al., CeU 61:351-359 (1990),<br>
which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference) and optionally possess low<br>
iramunogenicity. In particular, the 55 kDa (p55 TNF-R) and the 75 kDa (p75 TNF-R) TNF cell<br>
surface receptors are useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of these receptors, comprising<br>
the extracellular domains (BCD) of the receptors or functional portions thereof (see, e.g., Corcoran et<br>
al, Eur. J. Biochem. 225:831-840 (1994)), are also useful in the present invention. Truncated forms<br>
of the TNF receptors, comprising the ECD, have been detected in urine and serum as 30 kDa and 40<br>
kDa TNFa inhibitory binding proteins (Engelmann, H. et al, J. Biol Client. 265:1531-1536 (1990)).<br>
TNF receptor mul timeric molecules and TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules, and derivatives and<br>
fragments or portions thereof, are additional examples of TNF receptor molecules which are useful in<br>
the methods and compositions of the present invention. The TNF receptor molecules which can be<br><br>
used in the invention are characterized by their ability to treat patients for extended periods with good<br>
to excellent alleviation of symptoms and low toxicity. Low immunogenicity and/or high affinity, as<br>
well as other undefined properties, may contribute to the therapeutic results achieved.<br>
TNF receptor multimeric molecules useful in the present invention comprise all or a<br>
functional portion of the ECD of two or more TNF receptors linked via one or more polypeptide<br>
linkers or other nonpeptide linkers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). The multimeric molecules<br>
can further comprise a signal peptide of a secreted protein to direct expression of die multimeric<br>
molecule. These multimeric molecules and methods for their production have been described in U.S.<br>
Application No. 08/437,533 (filed May 9,1995), the contents of which are entirely incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules useful in the methods and compositions of the present<br>
invention comprise at least one portion of one or more immunoglobulin molecules and all or a<br>
functional portion of one or more TNF receptors. These immunoreceptor fusion molecules can be<br>
assembled as monomers, or hetero- or homo-multimers. The immunoreceptor fusion molecules can<br>
also be monovalent or multivalent An example of such a TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecule is<br>
TNF receptor/IgG fusion protein. TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules and methods for then-<br>
production have been described in the art (Lesslauer etal., Eur. J. Immunol 27:2883-2886 (1991);<br>

A functional equivalent, derivative, fragment or region of TNF receptor molecule refers to the<br>
portion of the TNF receptor molecule, or the portion of the TNF receptor molecule sequence which<br>
encodes TNF receptor molecule, that is of sufficient size and sequences to functionally resemble TNF<br>
receptor molecules that can be used in the present invention (e.g., bind TNFa with high affinity and<br>
I&gt;ossess low immunogenicity). A functional equivalent of TNF receptor molecule also includes<br>
modified TNF receptor molecules that functionally resemble TNF receptor molecules that can be used<br>
; n the present invention (e.g., bind TNFa with high affinity and possess low immunogenicity). For<br>
(sxample, a functional equivalent of TNF receptor molecule can contain a "SILENT" codon or one or<br>
more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions (e.g., substitution of one acidic amino acid for<br>
iinother acidic amino acid; or substitution of one codon encoding the same or different hydrophobic<br>
amino acid for another codon encoding a hydrophobic amino acid). See Ausubel et al.. Current<br><br>
Protocols in Molecular Biology\ Greene Publishing Assoc, and Wiley-Interscience, New York (1987-<br>
2003).<br>
Cytokines include any known cytokine. See, e.g., CopewithCytokines.com. Cytokine<br>
antagonists include, but are not limited to, any Ig derived protein, fragment or mimetic, any soluble<br>
receptor, fragment or mimetic, any small molecule antagonist, or any combination thereof.<br>
Therapeutic Treatments.<br>
Any method of the present invention can comprise a method for treating an BL-23p40<br>
mediated disorder, comprising administering an effective amount of a composition or pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising at least one !L-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant to a<br>
cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient in need of such modulation, treatment or therapy.<br>
Typically, treatment of pathologic conditions is effected by administering an effective amount or<br>
dosage of at bast one IL-23p40 Ig related protein composition diat total, on average, a range from at least<br>
about 0.01 to 500 milligrams of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
/kilogram of patient per dose, and, preferably, from at least about 0.1 to 100 milligrams Ig derived protein<br>
or specified portion or variant/kilogram of patient per single or multiple administration, depending upon<br>
the specific activity of the Ig protein contained in the composition. Alternatively, the effective serum<br>
concentration can comprise 0.1-5000 Mg/ml serum concentration per single or multiple adminstration.<br>
Suitable dosages are known to medical practitioners and will, of course, depend upon the particular<br>
disease state, specific activity of die composition being administered, and the particular patient<br>
undergoing treatment. In some instances, to achieve the desired therapeutic amount, it can be necessary<br>
ro provide for repeated administration, ie., repeated individual administrations of a particular monitored<br>
or metered dose, where the individual administrations are repeated until the desired daily dose or effect is<br>
achieved.<br>

Dosage forms (composition) suitable for internal administration generally contain from about<br>
0.1 milligram to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit or container. In these<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about<br>
0.5-99.999% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
For parenteral administration, the Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant can be<br>
formulated as a solution, suspension, emulsion or lyophilized powder in association, or separately<br>
provided, with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle. Examples of such vehicles are<br>
water, saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and 1-10% human serum albumin. Liposomes and<br>
nonaqueous vehicles, such as fixed oils, may also be used. The vehicle or lyophilized powder may<br>
contain additives that maintain isotonicity (e.g., sodium chloride, mannitol) and chemical stability<br>
(e.g., buffers and preservatives). The formulation is sterilized by known or suitable techniques.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, A. Osol, a standard reference text in this field.<br><br>

The invention further relates to the administration of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein<br>
or specified portion or variant by parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, bolus, vaginal,<br>
rectal, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, or transdermal means. An anti-IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or<br>
spiiafied portion or variant composition can be prepared for use for parenteral (subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular or intravenous) administration, particularly in the form of liquid solutions or<br>
suspensions; for use in vaginal or rectal administration particularly in semisolid forms, such as creams<br>
and suppositories; for buccal, or sublingual administration, particularly in the form of tablets or<br>
capsules; or intranasally, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops or aerosols or certain agents;<br>
or transdermally, particularly in the form of a gel, ointment, lotion, suspension or patch delivery<br>
sysrem with chemical enhancers, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, to either modify the skin structure or to<br><br>
increase the drug concentration in the transdermal patch (Junginger, et al. In "Drug Permeation<br>
Enhancement"; Hsieh, D. S., Eds., pp. 59-90 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York 1994, entirely<br>
incorporated herein by reference), or with oxidizing agents that enable the application of formulations<br>
containing proteins and peptides onto the skin (WO 98/53847), or applications of electric fields to<br>
create transient transport pathways such as electroporation, or to increase the mobility of charged<br>
drugs through the skin such as iontophoresis, or application of ultrasound, such as sonophoresis (U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 4,309,989 and 4,767,402) (the above publications and patents being entirely incorporated<br>
herein by reference).<br>
Pulmonary/Nasal Administration<br>
For pulmonary administration, preferably, at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant composition is delivered in a particle size effective for reaching the lower<br>
airways of the lung or sinuses. According to the invention, at least one EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant can be delivered by any of a variety of inhalation or nasal devices known<br>
in the art for administration of a therapeutic agent by inhalation. These devices capable of depositing<br>
acrosolized formulations in the sinus cavity or alveoli of a patient include metered dose inhalers,<br>
nebulizers, dry powder generators, sprayers, and the like. Other devices suitable for directing the<br>
pulmonary or nasal administration of Ig derived protein or specified portion or variants are also<br>
known in the art. All such devices can use formulations suitable for the administration for the<br>
dispensing of Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant in an aerosol. Such aerosols can be<br>
comprised of either solutions (both aqueous and non aqueous) or solid particles. Metered dose<br>
inhalers, like the Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, typically use a propellent gas and require actuation<br>
during inspiration (See, e.g., WO 94/16970, WO 98/35888). Dry powder inhalers like Turbuhaler™<br>
(Astra), Rotahaler* (Glaxo), Diskus* (Glaxo), Spiros™ inhaler (Dura), devices marketed by Inhale<br>
Therapeutics, and the Spinhaler* powder inhaler (Fisons), use bream-actuation of a mixed powder<br>
(US 4668218 Astra, EP 237507 Astra, WO 97/25086 Glaxo, WO 94/08552 Dura, US 5458135 Inhale,<br>
WO 94/06498 Fisons, entirely incorporated herein by reference). Nebulizers, like AERx™ Aradigm,<br>
the Ultravent* nebulizer (Mallinckrodt), and the Acorn II® nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products)<br>
(US 5404871 Aradigm, WO 97/22376), the above references entirely incorporated herein by<br>
reference, produce aerosols from solutions, while metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, etc.<br>
generate small particle aerosols. These specific examples of commercially available inhalation<br>
devices are intended to be representative of specific devices suitable for the practice of mis invention,<br>
and are not intended as limiting the scope of the invention. Preferably, a composition comprising at<br>
least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant is delivered by a dry powder<br>
inhaler or a sprayer. There are several desirable features of an inhalation device for administering at<br>
least one Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant of the present invention. For example,<br>
delivery by the inhalation device is advantageously reliable, reproducible, and accurate. The<br><br>
inhalation device can optionally deliver small dry particles, e.g., less than about 10 μm, preferably,<br>
about 1-5 μm, for good respirability.<br>
Administration of IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant Compositions as a<br>
Spray<br>
A spray including IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant composition<br>
protein can be produced by forcing a suspension or solution of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived<br>
protein or specified portion or variant through a nozzle under pressure. The nozzle size and<br>
configuration, the applied pressure, and die liquid feed rate can be chosen to achieve the desired<br>
output and particle size. An electrospray can be produced, for example, by an electric field in<br>
connection with a capillary or nozzle feed. Advantageously, particles of at least one IL-23p40 Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant composition protein delivered by a sprayer have a<br>
particle size less than about 10 uxn, preferably, in the range of about 1 μm to about 5 μm, and, most<br>
preferably, about 2 μm to about 3 urn.<br>
Formulations of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
composition protein suitable for use with a sprayer typically include Ig derived protein or specified<br>
portion or variant composition protein in an aqueous solution at a concentration of about 0.1 mg to<br>
about 100 mg of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant composition<br>
protein per ml of solution or mg/gm, or any range or value therein, e.g., but not united to, 0.1,0.2.,<br>
0.3,0.4,0.5, 0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1, 2,3,4, 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, 21, 22,<br>
23,24,25,26, 27,28,29,30,40,45,50,60,70,80,90 or 100 mg/ml or mg/gm The formulation can<br>
include agents; such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and,<br>
preferably, zinc. The formulation can also include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant composition protein, such as a buffer, a reducing agent,<br>
a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating Ig derived protein or specified<br>
portion or variant composition proteins include albumin, prolamine, or die like. Typical<br>
carbohydrates useful in formulating Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant composition<br>
proteins include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant composition protein formulation can also include a surfactant, which can<br>
reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
composition protein caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various<br>
conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyemylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and<br>
polyoxyethylone sorbitol fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 14% by<br>
weight of the formulation. Especially preferred surfactants for purposes of this invention are<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents<br><br>
known in the art for formulation of a protein such as IL-23p40 Ig derived proteins, or specified<br>
portions or variants, can also be included in die formulation.<br>
Administration of EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant compositions by a<br>
Nebulizer<br>
Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant composition protein can be administered by<br>
a nebulizer, such as a jet nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. Typically, in a jet nebulizer, a<br>
compressed air source is used to create a high-velocity air jet through an orifice. As the gas expands<br>
beyond the nozzle, a low-pressure region is created, which draws a solution of Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant composition protein through a capillary tube connected to a liquid<br>
reservoir. The liquid stream from the capillary tube is sheared into unstable filaments and droplets as<br>
it exits the tube, creating the aerosol. A range of configurations, flow rates, and baffle types can be<br>
employed to achieve the desired performance characteristics from a given jet nebulizer. In an<br>
ultrasonic nebulizer, high-frequency electrical energy is used to create vibrational, mechanical energy,<br>
typically employing a piezoelectric transducer. This energy is transmitted to the formulation of Ig<br>
derived protein or specified portion or variant composition protein either directly or through a<br>
coupling fluid, creating an aerosol including the Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
composition protein. Advantageously, particles of Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
composition protein delivered by a nebulizer have a particle size less than about 10 \xm, preferably, in<br>
the range of about 1 μrn to about S μm, and, most preferably, about 2 μm to about 3 urn.<br>
Formulations of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant<br>
suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, typically include a concentration of about 0.1<br>
mg to about 100 mg of at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant protein<br>
per ml of solution. The formulation can include agents, such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity<br>
agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, preferably, zinc. The formulation can also include an<br>
excipient or agent for stabilization of the at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion<br>
or variant composition protein, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate.<br>
Bulk proteins useful in formulating at least one EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or<br>
variant composition proteins include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in<br>
formulating at least one EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant include sucrose,<br>
mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The at least one IL23p40 Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant formulation can also include a surfactant, which can reduce or prevent<br>
surface-induced aggregation of the at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or<br>
variant caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants<br>
can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbital<br>
fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 49b by weight of the formulation.<br><br>
Especially preferred surfactants for purposes of this invention are polyoxyethylene soibitan mono-<br>
oleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art for formulation<br>
of a protein, such as Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant protein, can also be included in<br>
the formulation.<br>
Administration of IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant compositions By<br>
A Metered Dose Inhaler<br>
In a metered dose inhaler (MDI), a propellant, at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variant, and any excipients or other additives are contained in a canister as a<br>
mixture including a liquefied compressed gas. Actuation of the metering valve releases the mixture as<br>
an aerosol, preferably, containing particles in the size range of less than about 10 μm, preferably,<br>
about 1 μm to about 5μm, and, most preferably, about 2 um to about 3 fun. The desired aerosol<br>
particle size can be obtained by employing a formulation of Ig derived protein or specified portion or<br>
variant composition protein produced by various methods known to those of skill in the art, including<br>
jet-milling, spray drying, critical point condensation, or the like. Preferred metered dose inhalers<br>
include those manufactured by 3M or Glaxo and employing a hydrofluorocarbon propellant<br>
Formulations of at least one EL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant for<br>
use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally include a finely divided powder containing at<br>
least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant as a suspension in a non-aqueous<br>
medium, for example, suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant can be<br>
any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as chlorofluorocarbon, a<br>
hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorodifluorornethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, HFA-134a<br>
(hydrofluroalkane-134a), HFA-227 (hydrofluroalkane-227), or the like. Preferably, the propellant is a<br>
hydrofluorocarbon. The surfactant can be chosen to stabilize the at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived<br>
protein or specified portion or variant as a suspension in the propellant, to protect the active agent<br>
against chemical degradation, and the like. Suitable surfactants include soibitan trioleate, soya<br>
lecithin, oleic acid, or the like. In some cases, solution aerosols are preferred using solvents, such as<br>
ethanol. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein can also be included in the<br>
formulation.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the methods of the current invention can be<br>
achieved by pulmonary administration of at least one -IL23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion<br>
or variant compositions via devices not described herein.<br><br>
Oral Formulations and Administration<br>
Formulations for oral administration rely on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g.,<br>
resorcinols and nonionic surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-<br>
hexadecyl polyethylene ether) to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as<br>
the co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors,<br>
diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. The active<br>
constituent compound of the solid-type dosage form for oral administration can be mixed with at least<br>
one additive, including sucrose, lactose, cellulose, mannitol, trehalose, raffinose, maltitol, dextran,<br>
starches, agar, arginates, chitins, chitosans, pectins, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gelatin, coUagen,<br>
casein, albumin, synthetic or semisynthetic polymer, and glyceride. These dosage forms can also<br>
contain other type(s) of additives, e.g., inactive diluting agent, lubricant, such as magnesium stearate,<br>
paraben, preserving agent, such as sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, .alpha-tocopherol, antioxidant, such as<br>
cysteine, disintegrator, binder, thickener, buffering agent, sweetening agent, flavoring agent,<br>
perfuming agent, etc.<br>
Tablets and pills can be further processed into enteric-coated preparations. The liquid<br>
preparations for oral administration include emulsion, syrup, elixir, suspension and solution<br>
preparations allowable for medical use. These preparations may contain inactive diluting agents<br>
ordinarily used in said field, e.g., water. liposomes have also been described as drug delivery<br>
systems for insulin and heparin (U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,754). More recently, microspheres of artificial<br>
polymers of mixed amino acids (proteinoids) have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals (U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,925,673). Furthermore, carrier compounds described in U.S. Pat No. 5,879,681 and UJS. Pat.<br>
No. 5,5,871,753 are used to deliver biologically active agents orally are known in the art<br>
Mucosal Formulations and Administration<br>
For absorption through mucosal surfaces, compositions and methods of administering at least<br>
one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion or variant include an emulsion comprising a<br>
plurality of submicron particles, a mucoadhesive macromolecule, abioactive peptide, and an aqueous<br>
continuous phase, which promotes absorption through mucosal surfaces by achieving mucoadhesion<br>
of the emulsion particles (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,514,670). Mucous surfaces suitable for application of the<br>
emulsions of the present invention can include corneal, conjunctival, buccal, sublingual, nasal,<br>
vaginal, pulmonary, stomachic, intestinal, and rectal routes of administration. Formulations for<br>
vaginal or rectal administration, e.g., suppositories, can contain as excipients, for example,<br>
polyalkyleneglycols, vaseline, cocoa butter, and the like. Formulations for intranasal administration<br>
can be solid and contain as excipients, for example, lactose or can be aqueous or oily solutions of<br>
nasal drops. For buccal administration excipients include sugars, calcium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, pregelinatined starch, and the like (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,695).<br><br>
Transdermal Formulations and Administration<br>
For transdermal administration, die at least one IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified<br>
portion or variant is encapsulated in a delivery device, such as a liposome or polymeric nanopardcles,<br>
microparticle, microcapsule, or microspheres (referred to collectively as microparticles unless<br>
otherwise stated). A number of suitable devices are known, including microparticles made of<br>
synthetic polymers, such as polyhydroxy acids, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and<br>
copolymers thereof, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, and polyphosphazenes, and natural polymers,<br>
such as collagen, polyamino acids, albumin and other proteins, alginate and other polysaccharides,<br>
and combinations thereof (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,599).<br>
Prolonged Administration and Formulations<br>
It can be sometimes desirable to deliver the compounds of the present invention to the subject<br>
over prolonged periods of time, for example, for periods of one week to one year from a single<br>
administration. Various slow release, depot or implant dosage forms can be utilized. For example, a<br>
dosage form can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt of the compounds mat has a low<br>
degree of solubility in body fluids, for example, (a) an acid addition salt with a polybasic acid, such as<br>
phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid,<br>
polyglutamic acid, naphthalene mono- or di-sulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; (b) a<br>
salt with a polyvalent metal cation such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum,<br>
copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and the like, or with an organic cation formed from e.g., N.N'-<br>
dibenzyl-eth) lenediamine or ethylenediamine; or (c) combinations of (a) and (b) e.g., a zinc tannate<br>
salt. Additionally, the compounds of die present invention or, preferably, a relatively insoluble salt<br>
such as those just described, can be formulated in a gel, for example, an aluminum monostearate gel<br>
with, e.g. sesame oil, suitable for injection. Particularly preferred salts are zinc salts, zinc tannate<br>
salts, pamoate salts, and the like. Another type of slow release depot formulation for injection would<br>
contain the compound or salt dispersed for encapsulated in a slow degrading, non-toxic, non-antigenic<br>
polymer, such as a polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid polymer, for example, as described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No 3,773,919. The compounds or, preferably, relatively insoluble salts such as those described<br>
above can also be formulated in cholesterol matrix silastic pellets, particularly for use in animals.<br>
Additional slow release, depot or implant formulations, e.g., gas or liquid liposomes are known in the<br>
literature (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5.770,222 and "Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems",<br>
J. R. Robinson ed.. Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y., 1978).<br>
Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by<br>
reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as<br>
limiting.<br><br>
Examples of the Invention<br>
Example 1: Generation, Clothing and Expression of an anti-IL-23p40 hummoglobulin derived<br>
protein i Mammalian Cells<br>
Anti-IL-23p40 Ig derived proteins am generated using known method such as murine or<br>
transgenic mice expressing human antibodies that are immunized with human IL-23, and for which B<br>
cells are isolated, cloned and selected for specificity and inhibtting activity for IL-23 (preferably with<br>
little or no inhibition of IL-12 activity) using known methods and assays, e.g as known in the art and<br>
references to IL-23 proteins, IL-23 assays and IL-12 assays, entirely incorporaledhentn by reference,<br>
as as known in me art). Alternatively, portions of the IL-12 betal receptor are cloned and fused with<br>
antibody fragments to generate receptor fusion proteins mat Mode bindmg of 11^23 to h^ receptors but<br>
which do not inhibit binding of IL-I2 to its receptors, as known in me art<br>
Clones expressing IL-23p40 specific antibodies or fusion proteins, such as anti-IL-23p40Ig<br>
derived proteins of me present invention, are selected so tb^ they neutralires or inhibft at least one lL-<br>
23 activity and which do not substantially inhibit at least one IL-12 activity.<br>
The heavy chain, light chain CDRs, variable regkms, or variabk and constant regions are<br>
cloned and pot into appropriate expression vectors. A typical mammahan expression vector contains<br>
at least one promoter element, which mediates the fadtiation of tnmscrintion of mRNA, the Ig derived<br>
protein or specified portion or variant coding sequence, and signals required for me termination of<br>
transcription and polyadenyiation of the transcript Additional elements include enhancers, Kozak<br>
sequences and intervening seqoenoes flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNAspticing. Highly<br>
effcient trancription can be achieved with early and late promotes from SV40,the long terminal<br>
repeats (LTRS) from Retroviruses, e.g, RSV, HTLVL HTVI and the early promoter of the<br>
cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular elements can also be used (eg., the human actin<br>
promoter). Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include, for<br>
example, vectors, such as pIRESlneo, pRetro-Off, pRetro-On, PLXSN, or pLNCX (clonetech Labs,<br>
Palo Alto, CA), pcDNA3.1 (+/-), pcDNA/Zeo (4/-) or pcDNA3.1/Hygro (4/-) (invitrogen), PSVL and<br>
PMSG (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 371S2), pSV2dhfir (ATOC 37146) and<br>
pBC12MI(ATCC 67109). Mammalian host cells that could be used include human Hela 293, H9 and<br>
Jurkat cells, mouse NIH3T3 and C127 ceDs, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV 1, quail QC1-3 cells, mouse L cells<br>
and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.<br>
Alternatively, the gene can be expressed in stable cell lines that contain ate gene integrated<br>
into a chromosome. The co-transfection with a selectable marker, such as dhfir, gpt, neomycin, or<br>
hygromycin, allows die identification and isolation of the transfected cells.<br>
The transfocted gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded Ig derived<br>
protein or specified portion or variant The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful to<br>
develop cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest.<br><br>
Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy, et al., Biochem. J.<br>
227:277-279 (1991); Bebbington, et al., Bio/Technology 10:1(59-175 (1992)). Using these markers,<br>
the mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and me cells with the highest resistance are<br>
selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene(s) integrated into a chromosome. Chinese<br>
hamster ovary (CHO) and NSO cells are often used for the production of Ig derived protein or<br>
specified portion or variants.<br>
Cloning and Expression in CHO Cells<br>
The vector pC4 is used for the expression of IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion<br>
or variant Plasmid pC4 is a derivative of the plasmid pSV2-dhfr (ATCC Accession No. 37146). The<br>
plasmid contains me mouse DHFR gene under control of die SV40 early promoter. Chinese hamster<br>
ovary- or other cells lacking dihydrofolate activity that are transfected with these plasmids can be<br>
selected by growing the cells in a selective medium (e.g., alpha minus MEM, Life Technologies,<br>
Gaimersburg, MD) supplemented with me chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. The amplification<br>
of the DHFR genes in cells resistant to methotrexate (MTX) has been well documented (see, e.g., F.<br>
W. Alt, et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 253:1357-1370 (1978); J. L. Hamlin and C. Ma, Biochem. et Biophys.<br>
Acta 1097:107-143 (1990); and M. J. Page and M. A. Sydenham, Biotechnology 9:64-68 (1991)).<br>
Cells grown in increasing concentrations of MTX develop resistance to the drug by overproducing die<br>
target enzyme:, DHFR, as a result of amplification of the DHFR gene. If a second gene is linked to the<br>
DHFR gene, it is usually co-amplified and over-expressed. It is known in the art that mis approach<br>
can be used to develop cell lines carrying more man 1,000 copies of the amplified gene(s).<br>
Subsequently, when the methotrexate is withdrawn, cell lines are obtained mat contain the amplified<br>
gene integrated into one or more chromosome(s) of the host cell.<br>
The plasmid pC4 (and also pCl) contains for expressing die gene of interest the strong<br>
promoter of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (Cullen, et al., Molec. Cell.<br>
Biol. 5:438-447 (1985)) plus a fragment isolated from the enhancer of the immediate early gene of<br>
human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Boshart, et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985)). Downstream of the<br>
promoter are BamHL Xbal, and Asp718 restriction enzyme cleavage sites that allow integration of the<br>
genes; the multiple cloning sites facilitate cloning of the gene of interest Behind these cloning sites,<br>
the plasmid contains the 3' intron and polyadenylation site and termination signal of the rat<br>
preproinsulin gene. Other high efficiency promoters can also be used for the expression, e.g., the<br>
human b-actin promoter, the SV40 early or late promoters or the long terminal repeats from other<br>
retroviruses, e.g., HTV and HTLVI. Clontech's Tet-Off and Tet-On gene expression systems and<br>
similar systems can be used to express the IL-23p40 in a regulated way in mammalian cells (M.<br>
Gossen, and H. Bujard, Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5547-5551 (1992)). For the polyadenylation<br>
of the mRNA, other signals, e.g., from die human growth hormone or globin genes, can be used as<br>
well. Stable cell lines carrying a gene of interest integrated into the chromosomes can also be selected<br><br>
upon co-transfection with a selectable marker, such as gpt, G418 or hygromycin. It is advantageous<br>
to use moie than one selectable marker in the beginning, e.g., G418 plus methotrexate.<br>
The plasmid pC4 is digested with restriction enzymes and then dephosphorylated using calf<br>
intestinal phosphatase by procedures known in the art The vector is then isolated from a.1% agarose<br>
gel.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the complete IL-23p40 Ig derived protein or specified portion<br>
or variant i s used, corresponding to HC and LC variable regions of an IL-23p40 Ig derived protein of<br>
the present invention, according to known method steps. Isolated nucleic acid encoding a suitable<br>
human constant region (i.e., HC and LC regions) is also used in this construct (e.g., as provided in<br>
vector pl351).<br>
The' isolated variable and constant region encoding DNA and the dephosphorylated vector are<br>
then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. E. coli HB101 or XL-1 Blue cells are then transformed and bacteria<br>
are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC4 using, for instance, restriction<br>
enzyme analysis.<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking an active DHFR gene are used for transfection. 5<br>
ug of the expression plasmid pC4 is cotransfected with 0 .5 fig of the plasmid pSV2-neo using<br>
lipofectin. The plasmid pSV2neo contains a dominant selectable marker, the neo gene from Tn5<br>
encoding an enzyme mat confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are<br>
seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 ug /ml G418. After 2 days, the cells are<br>
trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates (Greiner, Germany) in alpha minus MEM<br>
supplemented with 10,25, or 50 ng/ml of methotrexate plus 1 ug /ml G418. After about 10-14 days,<br>
single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6-well petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different<br>
concentrations of methotrexate (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM). Clones growing at the<br>
highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6-well plates containing even<br>
higher concentrations of methotrexate (1 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM). The same procedure is<br>
repeated until clones are obtained that grow at a concentration of 100 - 200 mM. Expression of the<br>
desired gene product is analyzed, for instance, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot or by reverse phase<br>
HPLC analysis.<br>
The completely human anti-IL-23p40 protein Ig derived proteins are further characterized.<br>
Several of generated Ig derived proteins are expected to have affinity constants between 1x10* and<br>
1*1012. Such high affinities of these fully human monoclonal Ig derived proteins make mem suitable<br>
for therapeutic applications in IL-23p40 protein-dependent diseases, pathologies or related conditions.<br>
Example 2: Comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of auti-IL-12p35 and anti-IL-12/23p40<br>
antibodies in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)<br><br>
Summary: This set of studies was performed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of IH2<br>
or IL-12/23 specific neutralization in a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune<br>
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Neutralizing rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the<br>
p35 subunit of IL-12 or the p40 subunit, that is shared between IL-12 and IL-23, were administered<br>
either prior to disease induction, prior to disease onset, or after disease was ongoing. In all cases, only<br>
anti-p40 antibody demonstrated therapeutic potential. These data suggest that JL-23 is the<br>
predominant contributor to disease pathogenesis in this autoimmune model.<br>

Introduction: Biologically active IL-12 exists as a heterodimer comprised of 2 covalently<br>
linked subunits of 35 (p35) and 40 (p40) kilo Daltons. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated<br>
that IL-12 can induce robust Thl immune responses that are characterized by production of JJFNy md<br>
IL~2 from CD4+ T cells. Inappropriate Thl responses, and thus IL-12 expression, are believed to<br>
correlate with many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and uveitis. In animal<br>
models, IL-12 neutralization was shown to ameliorate an autoimmune disease. However, these<br>
studies neutralized IL-12 through its p40 subunit The description of IL-23, a heterodimeric cytokine<br>
that shares the p40 subunit, made it important to determine whether previous findings were due to IL-<br>
12 or IL-23 activity. Therefore, the p35 and p40 specific neutralization were compared in a mouse<br>
model of autoimmunity, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Neutralizing antibodies<br>
specific for EL-12p35 had no effect on EAE progression. In contrast, neutralization of both IL-12 and<br>
H.-23 with an anti-p40 mAb suppressed clinical signs of EAE whether antibody was administered<br>
before or after Thl differentiation. Our data suggests that the activity of anti-p40 treatment in EAE is<br>
based solely on neutralization of IL-23.<br>
Methods and Materials:<br>
Mice:<br>
Female C3H/HEB/FEJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in<br>
pharmacokinetic analyses. For EAE studies, female B10.PL (H-2") mice were obtained from the<br>
Jackson Laboratories, and were used between 6-8 weeks of age. All animals were maintained<br>
according to IACUC guidelines under approved protocols.<br><br>
Antibodies:<br>
C17.8 (rat anti-mouse IL-12/23p40, IgG2a), and C18.2 (rat and mouse IL-12p35, IgG2a)<br>
hybridomas were provided by Dr. Giorgio Trinehieri and the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA).<br>
Ascites was generated at Harlan Byproducts (Indianapolis, IN) and purified by protein G affinity.<br>
Serum PK of rat anti-mouse antibodies:<br>
Female C3H/HEB/FEJ mice, approximately 20-25 grams, were individually weighed and<br>
treated with a single 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal dose of 12SI labeled antibody (C17.8, C18.2), with a<br>
constant dose volume/mouse of 10 mL/kg. Retro-orbital bleeds were taken from anesthetized mice at<br>
30 minutes, 6 and 24 hours, 4, 7, 11 and 18 days. Blood samples were allowed to stand at room<br>
temperature for at least 30 minutes, but no longer than 1 hour, and were men centrifuged at<br>
approximately 2,300-3,500 rpm for 10-15 minutes. Approximately 50 uL aliquots of each serum<br>
sample were counted for 12SI using a LKB Compugamma 1282 counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD).<br>
10 mL aliquots of the injectates were also counted. The average fraction of injected counts at each<br>
time point was calculated and multiplied by the total mg of antibody injected to determine the total<br>
nig remaining in the serum at each time point Data is shown as the mean mg of mAb in the sera +/-<br>
s.d. with 5-10 animals in each group.<br>
EAR Induction and Scoring:<br>
For EAE induction, female B10.PL mice were injected subcutaneously over four sites on the<br>
back with a total of 100 |il of CFA (containing 200 Mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis Jamaica strain)<br>
combined with 200 (ig guinea pig-MBP (Sigma). Mice also received 200 ng pertussis toxin (List<br>
Biological, Campbell, CA) i.p. in 0.2 ml PBS at the time of immunization and 48 hours later. Mice<br>
received i.p. injections of C17.8 (anti-IL-12p40) or C18.2 (anti-IL-12p35) monoclonal antibodies<br>
diluted to 100 mg/kg (C18.2) or 20 mg/kg (C17.8) in PBS, on indicated days. Control mice received<br>
PBS or Rat IgG (Biosource) at 20 mg/kg in PBS.<br>
Animals that demonstrated clinical signs (cs) were scored as follows: limp tail or waddling<br>
gait with tail tonicity 1, waddling gait with limp tail (ataxia) 2, ataxia with partial limb paralysis 2.5,<br>
full paralysis of one limb 3, full paralysis of one limb with partial paralysis of second limb 3.5, full<br>
paralysis of two limbs 4, moribund 4.5, death 5. Animals that scored a 5 were not included in the<br>
mean daily cs analysis for the rest of the experiment Daily cs are averaged for the group, and mean<br>
incidence, day of onset, highest acute cs, cumulative cs, cs/day, number of relapses and relapse<br>
severity ± sem are described. Mean cumulative cs per group was calculated by averaging the sum of<br>
daily clinical scores for individual animals. Cs/day was calculated by dividing the cumulative cs by<br>
die number of days the animal remained in the study. To determine the mean day of onset, animals<br>
not developing EAE were not included in the analysis. To determine the mean highest cs, mice not<br>
developing EAE were assigned a value of "0" and included in the analysis. Relapses were defined by<br>
.ii full point drop in clinical score sustained for at least 2 observed days followed by a full point<br>
increase in clin ical score sustained for at least 2 observed days.<br><br>
Results and Discussion: Anti-p35 and Anti-p40 antibodies have identical pharmacokinetics<br>
To establish the clearance rates of anti-p40 and anti-p35 antibodies, normal mice were<br>
injected with a single 5 mg/kg dose of 125I labeled antibodies and circulating levels were measured for<br>
11 days post antibody administration. Anti-p35 and anti-p40 had overlapping pharmacokinetics,<br>
demonstrating that clearance rates are identical in normal mice (2). The expected clearance rate of<br>
each mAb is approximately 7-10 days. Although this is a single dose PK study, these data support<br>
once weekly dosing for in vivo studies.<br>
Only anti-p40 treatment prior to EAE induction is protective.<br>
To determine the relative roles of IL-12 and 1L-23 in an autoimmune disease, a murine model<br>
for multiple sclerosis, relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), was used. Upon<br>
EAE induction with myelin basic protein (MBP) in adjuvant, B10.PL mice typically exhibit an initial<br>
episode of paralysis (acute disease), then recover either partially or completely and progress through<br>
multiple relapses and/or chronic EAR It has long been assumed that EAE is dependent upon IL-12<br>
expression since IL-12 is believed to be a primary mediator of ThO to Thl differentiation. However,<br>
to distinguish the potential role of IL-23 in EAE induction, neutralizing concentrations of anti-p40<br>
(IL-12 and IL-23) or anti-p35 (IL-12 only) antibodies were established one day prior to immunization<br>
for EAE (Day -1). Onset of disease can vary between animals; therefore, treatment was repeated 7<br>
and 14 days later to ensure that anti-p35 and IL-p40 antibodies were present during Thl<br>
differentiation. Several in vitro neutralization studies have demonstrated that the anti-40 mAb is 5<br>
times more effective in neutralizing IL-12 than the anti-p35 mAb (data not shown). Therefore, the<br>
dose of anti-p35 mAb was adjusted to be 5 fold higher than anti-p40 in all EAE experiments. In two<br>
separate experiments, mice treated with Rat IgG isotype control antibody (20 mg/kg) or anti-p35 (100<br>
mg/kg) did not demonstrate protection from disease. It is important to note that peripheral<br>
administration of a non-specific control antibody (Rat IgG) did not alter the clinical course of disease<br>
when compared to non-treated mice with EAE. In both studies, mice treated with anti-p40 mAb (20<br>
mg/kg) exhibited nearly complete inhibition of EAE clinical signs. Remarkably, suppression of<br>
disease extended beyond the expected rate of antibody clearance through 70 days post EAE induction.<br>
In each experiment, only one animal treated with anti-p40 exhibited two consecutive days of EAE<br>
clinical signs, and each demonstrated a late onset and significantly lower acute clinical scores,<br>
cumulative clinical scores, and no relapses in disease (Table 1). These results demonstrated that<br>
neutralisation of EL-12 and EL-23 through the shared p40 subunit provided nearly complete protection<br>
from EAE. In contrast, specific neutralization of IL-12 only via anti-p35 was ineffective. These data<br>
strongly suggest that EAE is not mediated by EL-12.<br>
Only and-p40 treatment just prior to disease onset is protective.<br>
Although prophylactic treatment completely protected mice from EAE, it remained to be<br>
determined if EL-12 specific neutralization would be protective once the Thl population was<br><br>
established in vivo. Therefore, in a separate set of experiments, mice were treated with either a<br>
control antibody (Rat IgG), anti-p35, or anti-p40 monoclonal antibodies ten days after EAE induction,<br>
but prior to disease onset. Since typical immune responses occur within 7 days, this time point should<br>
be effective to reflect the effects of anti-IL-12 or anti-IL-23 mAbs on differentiated Thl cells. EAE<br>
onset can vary between animals; therefore, treatment was repeated 7 and 14 days later to ensure that<br>
anti-p35 and anti-p40 antibodies were present during the onset of disease. In two separate<br>
experiments, mice treated with isotype control antibody (20 mg/kg) or anti-p35 (100 mg/kg) were not<br>
protected from disease, when compared to untreated EAE mice. However, mice treated with anti-p40<br>
mAb (20 mg/kg) were significantly protected from EAE. As shown in the previously described<br>
studies, disease suppression was observed well beyond the time required for clearance of peripherally<br>
administered antibody through day 70 post EAE induction. Considering that antibody was not<br>
administered until after Thl differentiation (day 10), it was not surprising that disease incidence, day<br>
of onset, and the highest clinical score during acute EAE were not different in any group (Table 2).<br>
However, in both experiments, mice receiving anti-p40 exhibited significandy lower cumulative<br>
clinical scores, clinical scores per day, and relapse severity.<br>
Only anti-p40 treatment durinE established EAE is protective.<br>
The most difficult, but clinically relevant, hurdle for any therapy is to suppress established<br>
disease. Therefore, another set of experiments was performed in which mice were immunized for<br>
EAE, then divided into treatment groups once disease was ongoing. Approximately 30 days post<br>
BAE induction, mice had progressed through the acute phase of disease. At this time, animals were<br>
divided into groups with comparable cumulative and daily clinical scores. Treatment was repeated 7<br>
and 14 days later to ensure that antibodies were available in neutralizing concentrations during the<br>
iransition from acute to chronic or remitting-relapsing disease. Only anti-p40 treatment (20 mg/kg)<br>
ameliorated disease when compared to either isotype control antibody (20 mg/kg) or anti-p35 (100<br>
mg/kg) treated animals. Disease suppression was observed through day 80 post EAE induction. In<br>
I roth experiments, analysis from the first day of treatment through day 80 demonstrated that mice<br>
receiving anti-p40 exhibited lower cumulative clinical scores, clinical scores per day, and the least<br>
highest clinical score post treatment. These data suggest that not only is IL-23 likely to mediate Thl<br>
differentiation (Table 1) and EAE induction (Table 2), but IL-23 also contributes to the effector phase<br>
of chronic autoimmune responses (Table 3). Therefore, anti-p40 treatment can offer therapy at any<br>
lime in the progression of autoimmune disease.<br>
Mice were divided into 3 treatment groups with comparable disease severity once EAE was<br>
established (approximately day 30). Clinical scores were analyzed from the first day of treatment<br>
through 80 days post EAE induction. Data is shown as the mean per group ± s.e.m.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The understanding of the role of IL-12 in immune function has been based on studies of the<br>
{40 subunit of EL-12. Therefore, a side-by-side comparison of neutralization of the IL-12 specific p35<br><br>
subunit versus, the p40 subunit shared between IL-12 and IL-23 in an animal model of autoimmune<br>
disease was conducted. Neutralization via anti-p40 significantly inhibited EAE when mAb was<br>
administered at any time point However, IL-12 specific neutralization was completely ineffective.<br>
Therefore, our data shows that IL-12 only partially contributes to this autoimmune model and mat IL-<br>
'.'3 is expected be the more prominent mediator of autoimmune T cell responses.<br>

Animals:<br>
Female C3Heb/FeJ and B10.PL mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and female<br>
C :5 7BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh NC) between 6-8 weeks of age were used and<br>
maintained according to IACUC guidelines under approved protocols.<br>
Antibodies<br>
Rat monoclonal antibodies to mouse IL-23 were developed at Centocor (Malvern, PA).<br>
Negative rat IgG (from Biosource, Camarillo, CA) was used as a control. Neutralizing rat anti-mouse<br>
p40 (C17.8), and rat anti-mouse IL-12 (C18.2) antibodies were provided by Dr. Giorgio Trmchieri<br>
and the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA). Ascites was generated at Harlan Bioproducts<br>
(Indianapolis, IN) and antibodies were purified by protein G affinity chromatography.<br>
Cytokines<br>
Recombinant murine IL-12 was obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).<br>
Recombinant hlFN-y and human IL-2 were obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Murine IL-23<br>
was generated using transient transfection technology and Immobilized Metal Affinity<br>
Chromatography (IMAC). Briefly, separate expression constructs for murine p40 and murine pl9-His<br>
were co-transfeeted into HEK 293E cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as<br>
suggested by the manufacturers instructions. Alternatively, a linked IL-23 construct was generated as<br>
described and transfection of HEK293E cells was performed. Twenty-fours hours post-transfection,<br>
the growth medium was replaced with serum-free 293 SPMII (Invitrogen) and left to condition for 5<br>
days, The media was then removed, centrifuged, and processed by IMAC using TALON resin (BD<br>
Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). His-tagged proteins were eluted with 150 mM EDTA, then dialyzed<br>
against PBS, concentrated, filtered, and stored at -80°C. Bioactivity of both co-transfected and linked<br>
IL-23 was verified by splenocyte IL-17 protein production as described below.<br>
EL -12and IL-23 ELISA<br>
Murine IL-12 and murine IL-23 (1 ug/ml) were coated overnight on Nunc Maxisorp plates in<br>
PBS. After the plates were washed and blocked, rat anti-mouse p40, rat anti-mouse EL-12, and rat<br>
anti-mouse IL-23 antibodies were titrated and allowed to bind for 2 hours. Bound protein was<br><br>
detected using 1:10,000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antibody (from Jackson Immuno Research,<br>
West Grove, PA) followed by substrate. Data is shown as the mean optical density of replicate wells.<br>
IL-12 Neutralization<br>
Non- adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured for four days<br>
with 5 μg/ml PHA (Lectin, Phaseolus vulgaris, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in complete RPMM640<br>
(Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH, Lenexa, KS), 1% L-glutamine<br>
(JRH), 100 Units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested,<br>
washed, then cultured with rhIL-2 (10 units/ml) in the presence of murine IL-12 (1 ng/ml) either alone<br>
or pre-incubated with tested antibodies for 22 hours. Supematants were analyzed for human XFNy<br>
protein levels by luminescence immunoassay using anti-IFNy antibodies generated at Centocor.<br>
IL-23 Neutralization<br>
Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of C57BL/6 mice. 2xl06 cells/ml were<br>
cultured in complete RPMI with 10 U/ml rhIL-2 (Peprotech) and 1 ng/ml mouse IL-23, either alone or<br>
pre-incubated with tested antibodies for 3 days. Supematants were collected and analyzed for IL-17<br>
protein by ELIS A (R&amp;D Systems) per the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
EAE Analysis<br>
Female B10.PL mice were injected s.c. over four sites on the back with a total of 100 ul of<br>
complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) combined with 200 μg guinea pig-myelin basic protein (MBP)<br>
(Sigma). Mice also received 200 ng pertussis toxin (List Biological, Campbell, CA) i.p. in 0.2 ml<br>
PBS at die time of immunization and 48 hours later. Mice received i.p. injections of anti-p40, anti-EL-<br>
12, or anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibodies diluted to 100 mg/kg (anti-IL-12), 20 mg/kg (anti-p40, anti-<br>
IL-23), or 50 mg/kg (anti-IL-23) in PBS, on indicated days. Control mice were either not treated or<br>
received Rat IgG (Biosource, Camarillo, CA) at 20 mg/kg in PBS.<br>
Animals that demonstrated clinical signs (cs) were scored as follows: limp tail or waddling<br>
gait with tail tonicity 1, waddling gait with limp tail (ataxia) 2, ataxia with partial limb paralysis 2.5,<br>
full paralysis of one limb 3, full paralysis of one limb with partial paralysis of second limb 3.5, full<br>
paralysis of two limbs 4, moribund 4.5, death 5. Scores for animals that were sacrificed or scored a 5<br>
were not included in the mean daily cs analysis for the rest of the experiment. Daily cs are averaged<br>
for the group, and incidence, mortality, day of onset, highest acute cs, cumulative cs, cs/day, number<br>
of relapses and relapse severity ± sem are described. Mean cumulative cs per group was calculated by<br>
averaging the sum of daily clinical scores for individual animals. Cs/day was calculated by dividing<br>
the cumulative cs by the number of days the animal remained in the study. To determine the mean<br>
day of onset, animals not developing EAE were not included in the analysis. To determine the mean<br>
highest icute cs, mice that never developed EAE were assigned a value of "0" and included in the<br>
group mean. Relapses were defined by a full point drop in clinical score sustained for at least 2<br>
observed days followed by a full point increase in clinical score sustained for at least 2 observed days.<br><br>
r<br>
To determine the mean number of relapses per group, mice not demonstrating a defined relapse were<br>
assigned a value of "0" and included in the group mean. To determine the mean relapse severity, the<br>
highest clinical score of each relapse event was averaged and animals mat did not relapse were not<br>
included in the analysis.<br>
For ex vivo EAE analysis, spleens and peripheral lymph nodes (inguinal, axillary, brachial,<br>
and cervical) were harvested from each animal on days 10,17, 24, or 32 post EAE induction. Single<br>
cell suspensions (5 x lOVwell) were prepared from individual animals, washed twice, men cultured in<br>
vitro in RPMI complete for 72 hours with 40 μg/ml MBP, 5 μg/ml ConA, or media alone and<br>
proliferation was measured using ATPLite (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Data is represented as a<br>
stimulation index, which is the mean proliferation to MBP divided by the mean proliferation to media<br>
alone. Splenocytes and lymph node cells were also cultured at 4 x 106 cells/ml with 40 μg/ml MBP or<br>
media alone for 48 hours and supernatants were tested for IFNy, IL-17, EL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 proteins<br>
by ELISA, according to the manufacturer instructions (R&amp;D Systems). Even though minimal<br>
cytokine levels were detected in media-only cultures, those values were subtracted from the levels<br>
found in MBP-stimulated cultures so that the data presented represents only antigen-specific cytokine<br>
production.<br>
For histopathologic examination and ranking, mouse brains and spinal columns were fixed in<br>
10% buffered formalin by emersion. After fixation, the brains were sliced coronally into 4 segments.<br>
Spinal columns were decalcified in 5% EDTA and men sliced sagitally into 5 segments. The tissues<br>
were processed and embedded in paraffin using routine methods. Tissue blocks were sectioned at 5<br>
jim, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or Luxol Blue-Cresyl Echt Violet (Poly<br>
Scientific, Bay Shore, NT). Additional sections were stained immunohistochemically for glial<br>
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Sections were blinded and ranked<br>
based on the extent of inflammation. Brains and spinal cords were analyzed separately.<br>
Results<br>
IL-23 specific neutralization ameliorates EAE<br>
To confirm that neutralization of only IL-23 will provide effective therapy for EAE,<br>
monoclonal antibodies to mouse IL-23 were generated. As shown in Figure 1A, an antibody specific<br>
for mouse IL-23 that demonstrated no reactivity with mouse TL-12 was identified. Subsequent studies<br>
have shown that the anti-EL-12 and anti-EL-23 antibodies do not cross react even when 100 ng/ml of<br>
the opposite cytokine is present. As shown in Figure IB, the anti-EL-23 specific antibody binds to the<br>
p40 subunit of IL-23 and does not bind to the pl9 subunit. Accordingly, it is EL-23p40 specific.<br>
Since it was recently shown mat IL-23 will induce EL-17 production, these antibodies were<br>
tested for their ability to neutralize IL-23 bioactivity. As shown in Figure 1C, the EL-23 specific<br>
antibody inhibits IL-17 production with similar potency as anti-p40. In contrast, the anti-EL-12<br>
antibody demonstrated no effect on EL-17 levels. Lastly, to confirm that the anti-EL-23 antibody does<br><br>
not interfere with IL-12 function, the antibodies' ability to inhibit IFNY production in T cell cultures<br>
was tested. As previously demonstrated, anti-IL-12 and anti-p40 inhibited IFNY production, however,<br>
the anti-EL 23 antibody had no effect on IFNy levels (Figure ID). Therefore, a neutralizing anti-<br>
mouse IL-23 antibody that does not bind EL-12 or inhibit IL-12 mediated responses has been<br>
developed. The anti-IL-23 and anti-p40 antibodies were compared for w v/'w inhibition of EAE. In<br>
two separate experiments, mice were treated with either a control antibody, anti-p40, or anti-IL-23 ten<br>
days after EAE induction, which is prior to disease onset. Mice treated with anti-IL-23 demonstrated<br>
clinical suppression of EAE comparable to that of anti-p40 treated animals (Figure IE). Mice<br>
receiving anti-p40 or anti-IL-23 exhibited a later day of onset, reduced severity of acute disease and<br>
subsequent relapses, and lower clinical scores per day (Table 4). These results confirm that IL-23,<br>
rather than IL-12, is responsible for EAE even in mice that have not been genetically manipulated.<br>
EL-23 neutralization prevents EAE pomology in the CNS<br>
EAE. presents as an ascending bind limb paralysis and is therefore scored for severity by<br>
deficits in motor function. However, the cause of mis impairment can only be observed by assessing<br>
pathology within the brain and spinal cord. Therefore, a separate study was performed in which mice<br>
were immunized for EAE, then treated with control Rat IgG, anti-IL-12, anti-p40, or anti-IL-23<br>
antibodies on days 10 and 17, and sacrificed on days 17 and 24 by cardiac perfusion. Brains and<br>
spinal cords were analyzed for cellular infiltration by H&amp;E and demyelination by Luxol Fast Blue.<br>
Sections were blinded and ranked from least to most severe, then correlated to the clinical score of the<br>
animal on the day of sacrifice.<br>
As shown in Figure 2A, the severity of spinal cord pathology correlated with the clinical score<br>
severity, whereas brain pathology did not This is not surprising since clinical scoring is defined by<br>
motor ability, which is primarily a measurement of spinal cord function. Histopathology rankings<br>
were then sub-divided into treatment groups to assess differences after 2 in vivo antibody treatments<br>
(day 24). All treatment groups, including anti-IL-12, had lower pathology rankings man the Rat IgG<br>
treated control animals (Figure 2B). However, it is important to note that with treatment paradigms<br>
that are initiated 10 days post EAE induction, clinical protection with anti-p40 or anti-IL-23 is not<br>
typically observed until day 30 or later (Figure ID). Regardless, there were remarkable differences in<br>
spinal cord inflammation, demyelination, and astrocyte gliosis when the Rat IgG control and anti-EL-<br>
23 groups were compared. These data confirm that the clinical protection that is observed after anti-<br>
D-23 therapy is a result of partial protection from CNS pathology.<br>
As discussed above, for treatment paradigms that are initiated 10 days post EAE induction,<br>
clinical protection with anti-p40 or anti-IL-23 is not typically observed until day 30 or later (Figure<br>
ID). Therefore, day 24 may be too early to detect differences in CNS pathology between treatment<br>
groups. Regardless, there are remarkable differences in spinal cord inflammation and demyelination<br>
when the Rat IgG control and anti-IL-23 groups are compared. These data confirm that the clinical<br><br>
:cross sections using a monomorphic grid. Inflammation and demyelination in the brain is expressed as present<br>
(+) or absent (-).<br>

Novel anti-IL-23p40 specific human Ig derived proteins, including, without limitation,<br>
antibodies, fusion proteins, and mimetibodies, isolated nucleic acids that encode the anti-<br>
IL-2340 Ig derived proteins, vectors, host cells, transgenic animals or plants, and methods<br>
of making and using thereof, are useful for therapeutic compositions, methods and<br>
devices. Preferably, the anti-IL-23p40 specific human Ig derived proteins do not bind the<br>
p40 subunit of IL-12 and, thus, do not neutralize IL-12 related activity.</td>
