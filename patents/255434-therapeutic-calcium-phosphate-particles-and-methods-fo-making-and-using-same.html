THERAPEUTIC CALCIUM PHOSPHATE PARTICLES AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING SAME<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
[00011   This application is related to provisional patent application ll.S. Serial No. 60/544,693, filed February 13, 2004, which is incorporated herem by reference in its entirety.<br>
Statement Regarding Federally Sponsored Research or Development [0002] Not applicable.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0003]  The present invention relates to novel calcium phosphate particles, methods of making them, and methods of using them as carriers for deliver)' of biologically active macromolecules.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0004]  Macromolecule pharmaceutical, including proteins, peptide, polysaccharide, nucleic acid, lipids or the combination, are an increasingly important class of drags to treat various medical conditions. The primary route for administrating macro molecular Pharmaceuticals is injection, which is unpleasant, expensive and often results in poor patient compliance. Oral delivery is a preferred route to administer medicine. However, macromolecular drugs are poorly absorbed through intestines and can be easily destroyed by stomach acid or gastrointestinal enzymes. A promising approach to overcome the barriers for oral macromolecule delivery is to use nano-particles, which may offer protection from degradation and enable absorption of macromolecule drugs.<br>
[0005]  It has been reported that nano-particles loaded with insulin can be used to deliver bioaclive insulin to animals. For example, prevention of plasma glucose elevation by insulin loaded into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nano-particles with fumaric anhydride oligomer and iron oxide additives has been shown. Carino et al, Controlled Release 65:261, (2000). Another example of oral delivery of insulin with Chitosan nano-particles is provided by Pan et al., Intl. J. Pharmaceutics, 249:139, (2002). In addition, polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanocapsules have also been reported to be an effective carrier for oral delivery of insulin in diabetic animals. Damge et<br>

WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
al. Diabetes, 37:246, (1988). The uptake of particulate materials by gastrointestinal route is documented and lymphatic Peyers patches are involved. Hussain et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 50:107, (2001).<br>
[0006]  Among the factors affecting absorption of particles, particle size appears to be the primary factor. For example, Jan et al. (J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 42:821, 1990) studied the intestinal absorption of polystyrene particles of various sizes in rats. The absorption efficiency of polystyrene particles is clearly depending on the size. Particles less than 100 nm showed significant absorption, while largo particles (500 nm or more) only showed moderate to low absorption.<br>
[0007] The size dependence on particle intestinal absorption is also observed in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLGA particles by Desai et al. (Pharm. Res 13:1838, 1996). In this study, PLGA particles larger than 500 ncn showed virtually no uptake via intestinal tract, yet 36% of PLGA particle of 100 nm was absorbed.<br>
[0008] Nanometer scale particles have been proposed for use as carrier particles for biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. See U.S. patents 5,178,882; 5,219,577; 5,306,508; 5,334,394; 5,460,830; 5,460,831; 5,462,750; 5,464,634, 6,355,271.<br>
[0009]   Calcium phosphate particles are bio-adhesive/biocompatible and have been routinely used as carrier to deliver nucleic acid into intracellular compartments in vitro. Chen et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:2745-52, (1987); Welzel et al., J. Mater. Chem.l4:2213-2217 (2004); Jordan et al, Nucleic Acids Research 24:596-601 (1996); Loyter et al., Exp. Cell Res. 139:223-234 (1982). In addition, calcium phosphate has also been tested as carrier for genetic therapy to delivery large nucleic acid in vivo   Roy el al., Intl. J. Pharmaceutics 250:25, (2003).<br>
[0010]  Therapeutic calcium phosphate particles have been described. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,355,271; 6,183,803; U.S. Pub. Nos. 2004/0258763; 2002/0054914; 2002/0068090; 2003/0185892; 2001/0048925; WO 02/064112; WO 03/051394; WO 00/46147; WO 2004/050065; Cherian et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 26:459-463 (2000). The effect of oral formulation of insulin loaded calcium phosphate particles is tested in diabetic mice and control of blood glucose has been shown. Morcol et al., Intl. J. Pharmaceutics 277-91, (2004). The calcium phosphate particles disclosed have particle size between 300 nm to 10 um. The animal study used particle size in the range of 2-4 um in average. These particle sizes are clearly not optimal.<br>
[0011]  To make calcium phosphate particles with desired size, extensive sonication is required (Cherian et al. Drug Dev. Ind. Pharmacy, 26:459, 2000; Roy et al. Intl. J.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
Pharmaceutics 250:25, 2003), which may damage macromolecule drugs encapsulated and is not compatible to co-precipitation procedure.<br>
[0012]   Furthermore, the encapsulating efficiency of macrornolecules into calcium phosphate particles is often low. For example, U S. Pat. No. 6,355,271 discloses absorption efficiency of about 40% if insulin is added to preformed calcium phosphate particles; and about 89%, if insulin is mixed during the particle formation.<br>
[0013]   These reported methods either result in particles with less optimal size, or require harsh conditions such as extended sonication that are not compatible to macromolecule formulation. Therefore, there remains a need for oral macromolecule delivery system that is highly efficient and easily produced with low cost.<br>

WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
A.        Calcium Phosphate Nano-Particles with Encapsulated Biological Active Macromolecules<br>
[0036] The invention provides a calcium phosphate nano-particle comprising: a) a core of calcium phosphate nano-particle; b) a biologically active macromolecule encapsulated in the core particle; and c) a surface modifying agent comprising a bile acid encapsulated in the core particle.<br>
[0037] The calcium phosphate core particles of the present inventi6n have an average particle size (diameter) less than about 8000 am, less than about 1000 nm, more preferably, less than about 300 nm. The particles may have a diameter between about 50 nm and about 8000 nm, between about 100 nm and about 3000 nm, or between about 100 nm and about 1000 nm. In some embodiments, the average particle size is less than 200 nm. In some embodiments, the average particle size is less than 100 nm.<br>
[0038] The core particles of the present invention generally have a morphology that is generally and substantially spherical in shape and the size of the nano-particles is substantially mono-dispersed. The mono-dispersion refers to the narrow size distribution observed in these nano-particles, for example, within the range of about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, or about 50% difference in size. The surface of the particles maybe substantially smooth.<br>
[0039] The term "substantially spherical" is used herein to refer to particles that are substantially round or oval in shape, and includes particles that are unfaceted and smooth, or that have very few facets, as well as particles that are polyhedral having several or numerous facets. The term "substantially smooth" is used herein to mean essentially no surface features or irregularities having a size of 100 nm or larger. The core particles may be faceted or angular and still fall within this definition, as long as the facets do not contain many surface irregularities of the. type described above.<br>
[0040] Figures 3 A and 3B show the scanning electron microscopy images of examples of nano-particles prepared according to the methods described herein. Figure 3A shows blank nano-particles without macromolecule coated or dispersed with an average diameter of about 200 nm. Figure 3B shows the nano-particles with macromolecule insulin dispersed within the nano-particles with an average dimeter of about 70 nm. Theses nano-particles demonstrate spherical shape and narrow size distribution.<br>
[0041] The calcium phosphate nano-particles in the present invention contain a surface modifying agent comprising a bils acid which has dual function. As shown Example 1, encapsulation of biologically active macromolecules in the calcium phosphate nano-particles is enhanced when the particles are formed in the presence of a bile acid. The bile acid may also<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
enhance bio-adhesiveness of the nano-particles and affect the size of the nano-particles. Any bile acid may be used. Examples of bile acid include, but not 1imited to, cholate, deoxycholate, taurocholate, glycocholate, taurodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, tauroursodeoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate.<br>
[0042]   In some embodiments, the calcium phosphate nano-particles of the present invention further comprises a polyethylene glycol (PEG). The PEG may have a molecular weight from about 500 daltons to about 20,000 daltons, e.g., about 500, about 1000; about 5000, about 10,000, about 15,000, about 20,000 daltons.<br>
[0043]  Any biologically active macromolecules may be encapsulated in the core calcium phosphate nano-particles. Such biologically active macromolecules include, but not limited to, a protein, a polypeptide, a polysaccharide, a nucleic acid, a lipid, a carbohydrate, and a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the biologically active macromolecule is an insulin, an erythropoietin, an interferon, a growth hormone, or a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In some embodiments, the biologically active macromolecule is an allergen or an antigenic material. Examples of allergen are house dust mice, animal dander, molds, pollens, ragweed, latex, vespid venoms and insect-derived allergens, and any combinations thereof.<br>
[0044]   Biologically active macromolecules include any therapeutic agents, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin, steroids, drugs to treat osteoporosis, blood coagulation factors, anti-cancer drugs, antibiotics, therapeutic antibodies, lipase, beta-blockers, anti-asihma, anti-sense oligonucleotides, DNase enzyme for respiratory and other disease, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-virals, anti-hypertensives, cardiotherapeutics such as anti-airhythmia drugs, and gene therapies, diuretics, anti-clotting chemicals such as heparin, and combinations thereof. The agent may be a natural isolate or a synthetic, chemical or biological agent.<br>
[0045]  The calcium phosphate nano-particles may further comprises a coating. For example, the nano-particles coated and/or impregnated with biologically active macromolecules are further coated with an enteric polymer such as cellulose acetate phthalate, Eudragit, and Aquateric. The process of enteric coating has been well described in the art and references hereby are incorporated. Beyger et al., J. Pharm. Sci.75:573-578 (1986); Maharaj et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 73:39-42 (1984).<br>
[0046]   The invention also provides calcium phosphate nano-particles comprising a core of calcium phosphate nano-particle and a biologically active macromolecule encapsulated in the core particle, wherein the average particle size (diameter) of the core particle is less than about 300 ran, with the proviso that the biologically active macromoleoule is not a nucleic acid, a polynucleotide, a protein, or a polypeptide. The invention also provides calcium phosphate<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2005/084637		PCT/US2005/004247<br>
nano-particles comprising a core of calcium phosphate nano-particle and a biologically active macromolecule encapsulated in the core particle, wherein the average particle size (diameter) of the core particle is less than about 300 nm, and wherein the biologically active macromolecule is an antibody.<br>
[0047]  The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a calcium phosphate nano-particle described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers and their formulations arc known in the art and are described in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. Mack Publishing, 2000. The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in the form of solution, capsule, tablet, powder, and aerosol; and may be formulated in the form suitable for oral delivery, mucosal delivery, or delivery to a ocular surface. The composition may include other components, such as buffers, preservatives, nonionic surfactants, solubilizing agents, stabilizing agents, emollients, lubricants and tonicity agents. The composition may be formulated to achieve controlled release for the macromolecules.<br>
B.        Methods of Making Calcium Phosphate Nano-Particles<br>
[0048]  The invention also provides a method of making one or more particles of calcium phosphate, said method comprising: a) contacting an aqueous solution of a calcium salt with an aqueous solution of a phosphate silt in the presence of a surface modifying agent comprising a bile acid; b) mixing solution until calcium phosphate particles of a desired size is obtained; and c) recovering the particles.<br>
[0049]  The calcium phosphate nano-particles of the present invention are typically prepared as a suspension in aqueous medium by contacting a soluble calcium salt with a soluble phosphate salt, preferably, in the presence of a surface modifying agent comprising a bile acid.<br>
[0050]  In some embodiments, a distilled water solution of dibasic sodium phosphate having a concentration between about 1 ntM and about 100 mM, and a surface modifying agent such as deoxycholate having a concentration of 0.01-1 % (w/v) are prepared and mixed in a vessel. In some embodiments, other excipient such as polyethylene glycol having concentration of 1-30% (w/v) is also included.<br>
[0051]  The pH of the solution is controlled by the phosphate buffer system. The pH values affects the size the nano-particles and should be compatible with the stability requirement of the macromolecule to be encapsulated   The pH value may be between about 4.0 to about 9.0, or more preferably, between about 5.0 to about 8.0.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
[0052]  The particle size is affected by the concentrations of various components, including calcium, phosphate, and macromolecules. In general, the higher the concentration of the calcium or phosphate, the bigger the nano-particles.<br>
[0053]   To generate the nano-particles, an aqueous solution of calcium salt such as calcium chloride having a concentration between 1 mM and about 100 mM is mixed with the aqueous solution of phosphate described above. Turbidity forms immediately, indicating the formation of calcium phosphate nano-particles. Mixing is generally continued for 1 minute to 1 hour, or even longer (e.g., 2-48 hours). The size of the particles can be  educed by increasing the mixing speed or by sonication.<br>
[0054]  The calcium phosphate nano-particles generated may be further recovered and/or purified. In some embodiments, the formed calcium phosphate nano-particles having macromolecule encapsulated are recovered by centrifugation. The solution is centrifuged at 3000-1000 x g for 5-15 min and collected nano-particles are dried under vacuum. In some embodiments, the formed calcium phosphate nano-particles having macromolecule encapsulated are recovered by filtration. The solution is added to a filtration device such as buchel funnel with vacuum. The filtration membrane such as 20 nm Anodisc (Whatman) can be used to recover the nano-particles, which is further dried under vacuum<br>
[0055]   The particles of the present invention are formed in the presence of a surface modifying agent comprising a bile acid to increase the efficiency of entrapment of biologically active materials. Examples of bile acid that may be used in the present invention are cholate, deoxycholate, taurocholate, glycocholate, taurodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, tauroursodeoxycholate, or chenodeoxycholate. The concentration of the bile acid is generally to be from 0.01% to 5%. Generally, this procedure will result in substantially higher efficiency of coating or impregnating of the particles. For example, insulin loading efficiency in the presence of surface modifying agent can approach 100%, while only 50-60% in the absence of surface modifying agent under the same conditions.<br>
[0056]  Loading of the nano-particles with a biologically acti ve macromolecules is preferably carried out by mixing an aqueous calcium salt solution with the biologically active macromolecule to be incorporated prior to combining and mixing with phosphate solution in the presence of a bile acid and excipients, or mixing an aqueous phosphate salt solution with the biologically active macromolecule to be incorporated prior to combining and mixing with calcium salt solution in the presence of a bile acid and excipients. The biologically active macromolecule to be encapsulated may have a concentration of about 0.1-20 mg/ml. The nano-particles are maintained for a suitable period of time, generally between one minute to one hour.<br>

PCT/US2005/004247 WO 2005/084637<br>
The nano-particles can be separated from the suspension by either centrifugation or filtration and<br>
then dried under vacuum.<br>
[0057} The nano-particles of the tnvention may be further coated, for example, with an enteric coating. The enteric coating process and materials are well known and practiced in the art. It is well recognized that selection of different enteric polymers may result in changes of targeting area of gastrointestinal tract and pharmacokinetic behavior of the macrornolecules.<br>
[0058]  hi some embodiments, the calcium phosphate nano-particles encapsulated with biologically active macromolecules are suspended into an enteric polymer solution. The most commonly used solvent is acetone, ethanol or combination. For example, the nano-particles can be suspend at concentration of 10-100 mg/ml The ratio of coating polymer and core nano-particles may be between 3; 1 to 0.5:1, or preferably 2:1 to 1:1. The nano-particles may be dispersed by light sonication and 1-5 x volume paraffin oil may be added to the mixture. After complete mixing by vortex or sonication, 2-10 x volume of chloroform maybe added to solidify the coating polymer. The coated particles can be recovered by filter paper such as "Whatman Chr 3MM and wash with chloroform. The recovered product may be further dried under vacuum and ground to homogenous size.<br>
[0059J In some embodiments, the calcium phosphate nano-particles are suspended Into an enteric polymer solution having a concentration between 20-100 mg/ml and the ratio of coating polymer to the nano-particles is between 2:1 to 1:1. The suspension is lightly sonicated and added directly to a solvent that does not dissolve enteric polymer and miscellable with solvent to dissolve the enteric polymer. The volume ratio between the mixture and dispersing solvent is 1:10 to 500:1. The particles are recovered by filtration onto filter paper such as Whatman Chr 3MM. The particles are dried under vacuum and ground to homogenous size.<br>
[0060]  The particles of the invention may be further coated or impregnated, or both with other surface modifying agents. Such surface modifying agents suitable for use in the present invention include substances that facilitate the binding or entrapment of biologically active macrornolecules to the particle, without denaturing the maeromoleeule. Examples of suitable surface modifying agents are described in US patents 5,460,830, 5,462,751, 5,460,831, and 5,219,577. Other examples of SUJ table surface modifying agents may include basic or modified sugars, such as cellobiose, or oligonucleotides described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,577. Suitable surface modifying agents also include carbohydrates, carbohydrate derivatives, and other macromoleeules with carbohydrare-like components characterized by the abundance of —OH side groups, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,830. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a particularly suitable surface modifying agent<br>

WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
[0061]  Coating of calcium phosphate particles may be prepared by adding a stock solution of a surface modifying agent, such as cellobiose or PEG (e.g., around 292 mM) to a suspension of calcium phosphate core particles at a ratio of about 1 ml of stock solution to about 20 ml of particle suspension. The mixture can be swirled and allowed to stand overnight to form at least partially coated core particles. Generally, this procedure will result in substantially complete coating of the particles, although some partially coated or uncoated particles may be present.<br>

Bio-Equivalency of Oral Insulin in Enteric Coating Calcium Phosphate Nano-Particles<br>
[0119]  Animal Model. Thirty-five 8-10 week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were caged in a<br>
ventilated room. Food and water were supplied ad librium. Light cycle was set for every 12<br>
hours.<br>
[0120]  Rats were injected with 60 mg/kg streptozocin ip in 20 mM Citrate buffer, pH 4.5. 1 ml of 5% glucose was given ip at 8 hours after streptozocin. Alter two weeks, fasting blood glucose levels were measured. Fasting blood glucose was &gt;300 mg/Dl in 24 rats, which were used for subsequent testing.<br>
[0121]   Treatment. Sixteen rats were arbitrarily divided into three groups. Both insulin solution (OI-50, "Control") and insulin injection (SCI-5, "Injection") groups had 4 diabetic rats, respectively. The treatment group (PO-50, "Oral") had 8 rats Control group was given 50IU insulin/kg in 0.5 ml vehicle solution orally. Injection group received sc injection with 5 IU<br>
insulin/kg in 0.5 ml vehicle. Oral group was given 50 IU insulin/kg formulated in enteric coated<br>
calcium phosphate nano-particles orally in 0.5 ml vehicle solution. Vehicle solution was 2%<br>
carboxymethyl-cellulose in 10 mM Acetic acid, pH 4.0.<br>
Table 5 Insulin treatment schedule<br><br>
Group	Route	Number of animals	Volume	Dose<br>
OI-50 (Control)	Oral	4  	0.5 ml	50 IU/kg<br>
SCI-5 (Injection)	Subcutaneous	4	0.5 ml	5IU/kg<br>
PO-50 (Oral)	Oral	8	0.5 ml	50 IU/kg<br>
[0122]  After fasting overnight, rats were treated and blood samples were drawn via tail vein at time points of 0, 1, 3, 6,12, and 24 hours. Blood glucose was measured with a Glucometer (SureStep).<br>
[0123]  Figure 4 shows the percent blood glucose change at each time point after treatment with oral or subcutaneous insulin in diabetic rats. Subcutaneous insulin lowered blood glucose level quickly and return to normal within 12 hours. Oral insulin delivered with calcium<br>

Reduction of Blood Glucose in Healthy Volunteers by Oral Insulin in Enteric Coated Calcium Phosphate Nano-Particles<br>
[0124]  To assess the activity of oral insulin in enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles, two healthy human volunteers were tested. The standard glucose tolerance test was performed. Each volunteer was lasted for more than 12 hours and ingested 68 g glucose. The blood glucose was measured with a SureStep glucometer at -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min regarding to glucose ingesticn. Two cycles of measurement were performed for each volunteer. The first cycle was the standard glucose tolerance test to establish the baseline. Each volunteer took 200U oral insulin in enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles at -30 min during the second measurement cycle.<br>
[0125]  The blood glucose change in the first volunteer is shown in Figure 5A. Oral insulin delivered via enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles reduced both the peak and trough blood glucose levels.<br>
[0126]  The percent blood glucose change in the second volunteer is shown in Figure 5B. Oral insulin delivered via enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles reduced the peak blood glucose level and depressed the blood glucose curve throughout the measurement period.<br>
[0127]  This study shows that oral insulin in enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles are active in human subjects and may reduce blood glucose. No adverse reactions were recorded during the measurement.<br>
Example 12<br>
Control of Fasting Blood Glucose of Diabetic Patients by Oral Insulin in Enteric Coated Calcium Phosphate Nano-Particles<br>
[0128]  The feasibility of the oral insulin in enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles was further evaluated in diabetic patients. Nineteen type II diabetic patients who were regularly on insulin treatment to control their blood glucose levels volunteered for the study. Three cycles of evaluation were performed for each patient.<br>
[0129]  In the first cycle, each patient was fasted for more than 12 hours. The blood glucose levels were measured the next morning for every 30 min. A SureStep glucometer was used to<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2005/084637	PCT/US2005/004247<br>
determine the blood glucose level. No treatment was performed in this cycle to establish the baseline.<br>
[0130]  In the second cycle, each patient was fasted for more than 12 hours. The blood glucose levels were measured the next morning for every 30 min. A SureStep glucometer was used to determine the blood glucose level. Each patient was given 10 IU Humulin subcutaneous injection at time 0 in this cycle.<br>
[0131]  In the third cycle, each patient fasted for more than 12 hours. The blood glucose levels were measured the next morning for every 30 min. A SureStep glucometer was used to determine the blood glucose level. Either 100IU or 200IU oral insulin in enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles were given to each patient at time 0 in this cycle.<br>
[0132]  The sequence of measurement for each patient was arbitrary and there was a 48 hour Avash period after oral insulin measurement before next cycle. After the study, there are 17 usable patient data for baseline measurement, 19 patient data for insulin injection, 6 patient data for 100 IU oral insulin treatment and 11 patient data for 200IU oral insulin treatment.<br>
[0133]  The percent blood glucose change each cycle of measure is shown in Figure 6. Without treatment, blood glucose level were elevated and maintained relatively stable during the observation period. Insulin injection produced drastic reduction of blood glucose. In fact, 7 patients developed hypoglycemia and their blood glucose levels dropped below 50 mg/dL and had to be treated with oral glucose. In contrast, patient who took 100 IU or 200 IU oral insulin showed gradual yet statistically significant reduction of blood glucose level compared with baseline and no hypoglycemia was observed, In addition, patients treated with 200 IU oral insulin showed bigger reduction of blood glucose.<br>
[0134]  This study shows that oral insulin in enteric coated calcium phosphate nano-particles can effectively and dose-dependently control blood glucose level in diabetic patients.<br>
