				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The  present  invention relates to a bowl mill  for  a coal pulverizer  with  an air mill  for  primary entry of air  and  in particular to a new and useful design for the passage for primary air on to the bowl throat area of such pulverisers for improved velocity distribution characteristics. Background of Invention<br>
A variety of equipment are known suitable for grinding, i.e. pulverization of material like coal, lignite, cement etc. For the  pulverization  of  coal used in  boilers  of  thermal  power plants, a limited number of such equipment are commonly used. For the  purpose  of  discussion that follows, a  coal  fired  system mainly consists of a coal feeder, equipment for pulverizing coal, a distribution system for distributing the coal after the pulverization thereof, a furnace in which the coal is to be burned, and the requisite controls for effecting the proper operation of   the  coal  fired  generation  system.  The   equipment   for pulverization  of coal is of particular interest here.  The  coal pulverizng equipment are known to exist in prior art for more than  sixty years. Many improvements in the  construction  and/or mode of operation of these equipment have  been made during this period.<br>
The coal pulverizing equipment is chosen based on the advantages it offers in terms of reliability, low power consumption, minimum mainenance, a wide range of capacity, low rate of wear of the replacable grinding elements used with uniform throughput of the required range of pulverized coal fines during their useful life. In addition, it should have an integrated lubrication system, convenient adjustment and control of coal flow and fineness, ability to handle high tempeature air that is required for moisture coal and quiet operation.<br>
Bowl  mill is one such equipment which is commonly used  in fossil fired boilers of thermal power plant, which has the  above mentioned  features to different desirable degrees. The  name  is obviously derived from the fact that the pulverization takes place on  a grinding surface which resembles a bowl. Reference  can  be made to US Patent No. 3,465,971 (1969) and/or US Patent No.4,002,299 (1977)  which  give the nature of construction and  the  mode  of operation  of a prior art form of bowl mill that is suitable  for use in a coal fired power generation system for the pulverization of. the coal .<br>
Coal fired boilers used in thermal power plants require majority of the pulverised coal in a fineness range around 75 microns size for efficient combustion. Various types of<br>
pulverisers are employed in Thermal Power Stations. Raymond  Bowl mill  is one commonly used pulveriser for this purpose. The main components of a bowl mill consists of a cylindrical body, usually known  as  separator  body,  within which  a  conical  bowl  like grinding  table  is mounted for rotation,  three  equally  spaced grinding  rollers in the shape of inverted frustum of a cone  are mounted  so  as to interact with the rotating bowl to grind  the coal  lumps  fed on to the centre of the bowl into  fine  powder like  form. Three rollers are mounted on to  inclined  stationary axis  journal  shafts  by berings so that  the  roll  surface  is aligned  with the bowl surface and are able to rotate  about  the axis  by  the  friction force derived  from  the  rotating  bowl. Preselected  force can be applied between the bowl and  the  roll<br>
surface by means of spring or hydraulic , arrangement  to  assist<br>
grinding. The  ground  particles are thrown out of  the  bowl  by<br>
centrifugal force derived from rotation of the bowl.<br>
The hot primary air stream enters the mill from bottom of the mill known as air mill or air inlet housing, usually in horizontal direction through a single entry of rectangular cross section, such that entry air velocity is tangential, in the horizontal plane, to the annular space of the air mill. The hot primary air moves into the annular space which is the low velocity air plenum in the air mill, and is then accelerated and<br>
oriented by a series of stationary or rotating passages in a ring that  surrounds  that  grinding  zone.  These  arrangements   for directing the primary air through narrow annular area between the bowl rim and the housing are known as stationary or rotating vane wheel  depending on their kinematic disposition. There  are  many relevant  patents  on the subject of vane wheel in  which  it  is Claimed  that the vane wheel arrangement directs the  air  stream upward  through the annular passage between the bowl rim  and  the housing  in an efficient manner. US Patent 4,264,041 (year  1981) titled  "Low Pressure Drop Pulverizer Throat", describes  a  new and  improved  design of pulveriser air throat for  low  pressure drop,  reduced erosion and improved flow distribution.US  Patent 4,523,721 ( year 1985) titled "Bowl Mill with Primary Classifier Assembly", describes a rotating vane wheel arrangement for change in the direction of flow, counter clockwise to the direction of rotation  of  the  grinding table which is  helpful  for  primary classification  of  coarser  coal  particles.  U.S.  Patent   No. 4,687,145  (  year 1987) titled " Roll and Race  Pulverizer  with rotating  throat"  summarises the invention as a  roll  and  race pulveriser in which the throat vanes are mounted for rotation in the  direction  of rotation of the grinding  ring.  The  rotating vanes are claimed to be spreading the ground coal spilling on  to the throat area. There are other patents like US Patent 5,18,404 (year  1983),  5,020,734  ( year 1991),  2378681  (  year  1945), 2545254  (year  1951), on the subject. In the US  Patent  5263655 (year 1993) titled Coal Pulverizer an improved annular passage arrangemet  for  pulverizer  has been  advocated  to  reduce  the pressure  drop across the vane wheel and also thereby to  provide means of directing passage outlet airflow away from the  grinding table. It is also claimed to be improving the distribution of air velocity across the annular passage.<br>
At the outlet of the passage near the bowl rim, the pulverized coal particles are entrained by high speed air flow. The heavier coal, stone or quartz particles fall down through the annular space between the bowl and the body on to the mill base as rejects.<br>
The velocity of air is reduced above the bowl rim area in the main pulverizer housing causing the larger particles to be returned directly to the grinding zone for further crushing, while the smaller particles are carried up through the classifier for final sizing. The moisture present in the ground coal particles are also dried in the process of association with hot air. The ground coal particles carried to classifier, get classified and the lighter particles of desired fineness go to the different elevation of the boiler through four outlet ports and  the  heavier  particles fall back on  to  bowl  for  further regrinding continuing the cycle, of pulverization.<br>
US Patent No. 3,465,971 issued in 1969 titled "Deflector Arrangement for Use in a Grinding Mill", disclosed construction of a deflector for directing the air borne pulverized material leaving the grinding ring downwardly and inwardly back for better primary classification. In this patent the entry of primary air In the air mill is through a single inlet. This type of bowl mills known as Raymond Bowl Mill, have single entry of primary air.<br>
In actual operation of this type of mills, the drawbacks encountered are dissimilar wear on the three rolls., high rate of rejects and non uniform output from the outlet ports. These drawbacks are suspected to be due to non uniform air flow inside the mill and also inadequate air velocity in certain areas inside the mill. It is also found that the clinker formation in the airmill are due to formation of eddies and vortices in the air mill.<br>
Analytical  studies using computational fluid  flow software package reveals that the distribution of airflow in the air mill suction is not uniform around the poriphory, It is seen in such a study that with single entry of primary air into the mill only about 60 percent of the total cross sectional area  has  high  velocity. Further  away  from  the inlet, the velocity  of  air  loses  its magnitude to very low value compared to the velocity at the entry region. This essentially means that in about 40 percent of peripheral area of the bowl, the coal particles will not be lifted with desired velocity and will result in falling back on the bowl for regrinding. Another effect could be heavy rates of rejects containing coal lumps and other particles through that part of the throat area where the vertical velocity componet of air is less. Such a study also shows the presence of considerable eddies and vortices, specially in the last quadrant of the air mill section from the entry.<br>
The purpose of introducing rotating vane wheel in some of the patents described in earlier paragraphs appears to be to remove the deficiency of the non—uniform distribution of air velocity around the bowl rim coming from the air mill. This is attempted by spreading the incoming air and also the falling pulverized coal, which is possible only to a limited extent by the rotating vanes attached to the bowl. This effect can only be very localised as the fanning action can not bring about a high degree of uniformity where the peripheral velocity of the bowl is much less compared to the average vertical velocity of the primary air near the bowl rim.<br>
Considerable improvement in primary classification is possible by uniform flow distribution reducing regrinding. Similarly minimization of eddies and vortices will lead to<br>
cutting  down  energy  losses  and  also  avoid  accumulation  of inflammabie rejects which lead to clinker formation.<br>
It  is,  therefore, an object of the  present  invention  to achieve  much  better uniformity in airflow around the  air  mill section  of a bowl mill of a coal pulverizer, for having  uniform output from the outlet ports and for avoiding dissimilar wear on the rolls.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to minimize the eddies and vortices formed by the non uniformity of flow for avoiding clinker formation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the amount of undesirable rejects from the mill.<br>
A  still further object of the present invention  to  reduce the  overall energy consumption and make the mill operation  more efficient. Summary of the Invention:<br>
These objects are achieved in the present invention by providing a multiple entry system for primary air for uniform velocity distribution throughout the periphery of the bowl rim and transportation of ground coal of the classifier.<br>
In the prior art design the primary air meant for transporting ground coal, does not have uniform distribution through out the periphery of the bowl rim. In the present<br>
invention,the uniformalty of tv of velocity distribution around the periphery of the bowl rim is achieved by providing multiple entry of the primary air into the air mill section from where the air changes its direction to transport the around coal upwards from the bowl rim. The number at entries starting with double entry including single entry bifurcation) results into a much better<br>
tJ) fat ri tout ion  of a:ir velocity for transportation of  ground  coal<br>
from the bowl rim to the classifier compared to that with  single<br>
entry.<br>
Thus  the present invention provides a bowl mill for a  coal pulverizer with an air mill for primary entry of air, comprising a substantially closed separator body  having a central axis; and a bowl—like grinding table  mounted  on  a  shaft rotatable about said central axis, cooperating with a plurality of grinding rolls; characterized  in that  said  air  mill  is provided with multiple  entry  annular openings on the outer wall of  said  air mill  for  multiple  entry of hot primary air  from  the  inlets, resulting  in better uniformity in air flow around the  air  mill section and for minimising formation of eddies and vortices.<br>
In the present invention, the area for inlet of air into the air  mill is maintained but the number of inlets is increased  to provide  more  uniform  energy  input  sectorially  through   the<br>
multiple  inlets compared to the prior art design. The  proposed layouts  for  each of the multiple entry configuration  can  have different  cross sections like rectangles of different width  and height in line with cost consideration, existing ducting,  layout problems, flow considerations etc. According to present invention<br>
as  a  particular case of multiple entry, two  separate  ductings<br>
with  one entry each placed nearly 180  apart has been  proposed.<br>
Two  variations have been given. In the first one, the height  of<br>
the annular air entry opening has been reduced to half, while in the second embodiment both height and width have been reduced keeping the area of individual entry,half of that of a single entry design. The computational fluid flow analysis has shown improvement in velocty distribution across the circumference compared to the prior art arrangement. However, the first of the two arrangements proposed show less eddies.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention an alternate arrangement for air entry is provided, which is suitable for cases where multiple entry with separate ducting is not feasible due to cost limitation, or layout limitations or both. In such a case, the total area is divided into two sections at the inlet by providing partition wall in the flow path such that the flow in each section is in the ratio of around half the original flow taking into the flow losses. The half section at inlet adjacent<br>
to the annular space in the air mill below the bowl, directs the air flow through that section tangentially into the air mill for providing sufficient velocity for lifting of coal particles, up to first half of the circumference in that plane and the other half of the bifurcated primary air has sufficient energy to provide sufficient vertical velocity in the other half of the circumference of throat area. The various features of novelty which characterise the invention are pointed out with particularity in the detailed description which follows forming part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying drawing and descriptive matter in which the preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated.

Referring now to the drawing, and more particularly Figure—I shows a schematic diagram of the essential components of a bowl mill required for describing the nature of construction and the mode at operation of a bowl mill, generally designated by reference numeral 1, specially with reference to the multiple entry of primary air developed in the present invention. The description of details of various parts and the working of the bowl mill will be given here only to the extent relevant for explaining the working of the air mill of the present invention.<br>
Figure-1 shows a substantially closed separator body 2, which enclose* the grinding zone of pulverisation. A bowl like<br>
grinding table 3 is mounted on a shaft 4,which in turn is connected to a drive machines(not shown) which can rotate  the table at the desired speed. A set of replacable wear part  called bull ring segments  5  made of hard abrasive resistant  material are placed on  the bowl to co-act with the grinding roll 6. A  plurality  of grinding  rolls   6,   preferably three in  number  are  suitably supported within the interior of the separator body 2 so as to be spaced equidistantly one from  another  around  the circumference of  the  latter. Each roll is suitably supported  on  a  suitable shaft 7 for rotation relative thereto. Additionally the roll shaft assembly  can move in  the  vertical  plane  by rotation of the shaft  assembly  about  the trunion shaft  8  which  is  in  turn suitably mounted in the separator body  2. The vertical movement of the roll is restricted by  application  of force by a spring mounted in a spring housing assembly  9.  The  spring is used to exert the requisite amount of force through the grinding roll on to  the  material,  e.g. coal that is disposed  on  the  grinding table. The material to be ground such as coal  lumps of specified size range are fed through the vertical  feed  pipe 10 on to the centre  of  the rotating bowl. Under the  action  of  centrifugal force  the coal lumps move radially outward with respect  to  the bowl.  Being simultaneously under rotating motion along with  the bowl, these coal lumps as a part of a moving coal<br>
bed  has to pass through the roll and bull ring segments  on  the<br>
bowl. The gap between roll and the bowl being less than the  coal<br>
bed height, the coal lumps in the bed get pulverised between  the<br>
roll  and  the  bull ring segments by attrition  and also  direct<br>
enaction.  The  spring  force  adds to the  weight  of  the  roll<br>
assembly to crush the coal. The coal particles of  various  sizes<br>
flaw  out of bowl rim as they reach it. Pressurized  hot  primary<br>
air  coming through the air mill housing (11) and  flowing  upward<br>
passes  between  the bowl rim and the separator body  at  a  high<br>
velocity   to  carry  the  coal  particles  upward  towards   the<br>
classifier  inlet  (12).  The particles or lumps  of  the  ground<br>
material,  which can not be lifted from the edge of the  bowl  by<br>
the  primary air fall down through the gap between the  bowl  rim<br>
and  the separator body on to the air mill bottom as reject.  The<br>
reject  gets  out of the system through discharge  hopper  (  not<br>
shown).  The nature and the construction of the air mill  housing<br>
(11)  comprise the subject matter that forms the essence  of  the<br>
present  invention. Heavy coal particles in the upward stream  of<br>
air/coal mixture which are not supported by the air velocity fall<br>
back  on the bowl before reaching the classifier inlet  (12).  In<br>
the classifier ( 13), the finer particles are required for proper<br>
combustion  in the boiler goes out through the outlet  port  (14)<br>
and the heavier undesired particles fall back on the bowl through<br>
the cony (15) and get  mixed with the incoming coal lumps.<br>
Turning now to the role of air mill in achieving the desirable features of a pulverizer described earlier, reference will be made for this purpose particularly to Figures 2 to 5 of the drawing, in the prior art, the hot primary air enters the air mill housing through a rectagular inlet opening (16) as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The entry velocity of air is in the horizontal direction to flow into the annular opening 16' between the air mill outer circumferential wall and the inner circumferential wall below the grinding table (3). In this low velocity plenum, the air velocity changes direction towards vertical to flow through the narrow annular gap between the bowl (3) rim and the separator body (2) for conveyance of the coal from the grinding table (3). The circular annular gap is also called the throat.<br>
The  stream of air flowing out of the throat area  with  coal particles  entrained therein follow a tortuous path  through  the interior  of  the  separator body. Moreover,  in  the  course  of following the tortuous path the larger of the coal particles  are caused  to  be separated from the air stream in  which  they  are entrained and made to return to the surface of the grinding table (3) whereupon they undergo pulverization. This process is called primary classification. The lighter of the coal particles, on the<br>
other hand, continue to be carried along the air stream to the classifier inlet (12).<br>
Separator body liner with static vanes (US Patent No. 4,234,132 dt. Nov. 18, 1980) or rotating vane wheels (US Patent No. 4,602,745, dt. July 29, 1986) are employed in bowl mill for the purpose of primary classification. These devices provide a direction to the upcoming air from the air mill for better primary classification. The rotating vane wheel additionally enables localized spreading of the upcoming primary air due its dotation. This spreading is preferred to lessen the deficiency or non uniformity of velocity distribution of the upcoming primary air. However, due to its localised effect, it is effective in a very imited way.<br>
With the entry of air from a single inlet, the velocity of the upcoming primary air through the throat area decreaes continuously with distance from entry as it travels around the<br>
air mill housing. So much so that by the time it travels, may  be<br>
o more  than 270  around the air mill from the entry, it attains  a<br>
very low velocity, insufficient for lifting of the pulverized coal particles thrown out of the grinding table by centrifugal action. This results into increase in the undesirable rejects, improper primary classification and non uniformity of the flow around the separator body onto the classifier and finally to the<br>
outlet ports. The single entry of the primary air also produces address and vortices in the air mill resulting into accumulation of coal particles on the base of the air mill to form clinkers which very often cause fire in the mill. These problems are encountered in the mills operating with prior art design with single entry of primary air.<br>
These observations tally with actual problems in field. The air flow in the bowl mill has been studied analytically using commercially available computational fluid flow package.<br>
The results of those studies have confirmed the validity of above observations. As an example, the velocity distribution in a horizontal plane in the air mill shows gradual decrease of velocity of air as it travels away from the entry and as also the formation of vortices and eddies.<br>
To overcome the above deficiencies in the prior art by making the velocity distribution uniform all around the throat area, a multiple entry of primary air into the air mill is proposed instead of single entry. Two preferred embodiments of multiple entry are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b. Although more number of entries will achieve successively better velocity distribution around the throat area but limitation will come from the point of view of layout and cost. In the double entry configuration, each entry area is kept half of the original area of the single entry<br>
so as not to alter the inlet velocities. In the double inlet ducting configuration two variations are possible. The first variation is shown in Fig. 3a where the height of the annular openings 17' and 17" is reduced by half. In the second variation shown in Fig. 3b, in each of the openings 18' and 18", both the height and the width are altered keeping the area of each entry<br>
approximately  half  of the original entry area of  single  entry<br>
system. The multi entry openings 17, 17" and 18,18" are set 180<br>
apart.<br>
Where it is not possible to have more than one duct for primary air into the air mill due to constraints in layout or cost, an alternative arrangement is proposed in this invention. Reference is made to the Figs. 4a and 4b showing the line diagram and plan outline view of the air mill (11) with single inlet (19) with bifurcation of the primary air at inlet. The novelty of this arrangement is that the primary air through the single inlet (19) and the duct (20) is bifurcated. About half of the incoming primary air enters the airmill through a first opening (21) provided on the outer wall of the air mill (11). The other half gets channelized into the duct (23) through the opening (22).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
