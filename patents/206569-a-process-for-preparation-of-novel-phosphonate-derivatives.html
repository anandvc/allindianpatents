The PATENT ACT, 1970<br>
(39 of 1970) Complete Specification<br>
A [PROCESS FOR  PREPARATION OF <br>
NOVEL PHOSPHONATE DERIVATIVES<br>
CADILA HEALTHCARE LTD, Zydus Research Center Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway, Ahmedabad-<br>
380015, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
8 JAN 2004<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel phosphonate derivatives of formula (I), their lalogs, their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their larmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions  ining them. The present invention also relates to a process of preparing compounds formula (I), their analogs, derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their  tically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and ermediates involved in their synthesis.<br><br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) induce an increase in an individual's bone mass and also are found to lower or modulate triglyceride levels and/or cholesterol levels and/or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and raise HDL plasma levels (JP 20102687) and hence are useful in the treatment of bone wasting diseases like osteoporosis (US 5508273 and in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease events, vascular restenosis, diabetes and many other related conditions (US 5043330).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used in medical conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, dysmenorrhea, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis and other similar disease conditions.<br>
The compounds have effects on different parasites (J. Med. Chem., 2001,44, 909-916).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful as inhibitors of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, reprolysin (also known as adamylsin) subfamilies and of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) activity.<br><br>
Osteoporosis is a bone-wasting disease in which there is an imbalance or uncoupling between the rate of bone formation and resorption resulting in a decrease in total bone mass. As a result of this decrease in bone mass the skeleton becomes weakened and unable to bear the normal weight-bearing stresses. The effects of osteoporosis are generally seen in the weight-bearing part of the skeleton, especially the spine and hips, which can fracture in the absence of trauma. The current therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis consist of treatments which are for the most part preventative but they do not induce an increase in bone mass which is needed to reduce fracture risk and pain. The present invention focuses on agents which are useful in treating bone wasting diseases by increasing an individuals bone mass and thus reducing or eliminating fracture risk.<br>
Diabetes is associated with other diseases such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, angina and cardiovascular diseases. Recent addition of drugs in the treatment of diabetes are the thiazolidinediones, drugs having insulin-sensitizing action. These are useful in treating diabetes, lipid metabolism but are suspected to have tumor-inducing potential and cause hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to liver failure. Presently, there is a need for a safe and an effective drug, to treat insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia [Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes: 109(4), S548-9 (2001)]. The compounds of the present invention can be used in treatment of diabetes and the associated conditions like type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, disorders related to syndrome X such as hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, xanthoma, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases and related disorders, certain renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, etc.<br>
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) is responsible for cleavage of cell bound tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a, also known as cachectin). TNF-a is recognized to be involved in many infectious and auto-immune diseases (W. Friers, FEBS Letters, 285,199 (1991)). Further, TNF-a has been shown to be the prime mediator of the inflammatory response seen in sepsis and septic shock. Compounds, which are inhibitors of TACE, prevent the formation of TNF-a and prevent the deleterious effects of it. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel phosphonate derivatives represented by the general formula (I), their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them or their mixtures thereof.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel phosphonate derivatives represented by the general formula (I), their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them or their mixtures thereof having enhanced activities, without toxic effects or with reduced toxic effect.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel phosphonate derivatives represented by the general formula (I), their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the general formula (I), their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates or their mixtures in combination with suitable carriers, solvents, diluents and other media normally employed in preparing such compositions.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide process for preparation of intermediates involved in the process.<br>

Several synthesis routes can be employed to prepare the compounds of the present invention well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of formula (I) can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Referred methods include, but not limited to those described below.<br>
The novel compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section . The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and are suitable for the transformations being effected. When preparing or elaborating compounds of the invention containing heterocyclic rings, those skilled in the art recognize that substituents on the ring may be prepared before, after or concomitant with the construction of the phosphonate compounds. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the nature and order of the synthetic steps presented may be varied for the purpose of optimizing the formation of the compounds of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that certain reactions are carried out when other potentially reactive functionality on the molecule is masked or protected to avoid undesired side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. The desired protective groups may be found T. W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts " Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 2nd edition 1991, Wiley and Sons, New York. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the protective groups present on various reactive functionality of the molecule must be compatible with reagents and reactions proposed and it will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art an alternate methods must be used. The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials used and are suitable for the transformations being effected. The phosphonate compounds of the present invention are prepared by methods outlined in Schemes 1 and 2.<br>
Scheme-1 illustrates the preparation of the a-carboxyphosphonate compounds. Suitably substituted aldehyde derivatives of the formula (2) where A is as defined earlier, is reacted with trialkyl phosphonoacetate of formula (3) where R2 represents COOR5 or<br><br>
CONR6R7 and R5, R6 and R7 are as defined earlier, in the presence of Lewis acids such as SnCU, TiCl4 and the like in the presence of organic base to get an a,p-unsaturated carboxy-phosphonate (4) where A, R1 and R2 are as defined earlier. Organic base can be used but not limited to bases such as piperidine, N-methyl morpholine and the like. Temperature of the reaction is in the range of -20 °C to 30 °C, but preferably 0 °C. An a,p-unsaturated-carboxy-phosphonate (4), on reduction with reducing agent such as NaBrLt, NaBF^CN and the like lead to its saturated derivative (I) where A, Ri and R2 are as defined earlier. The reduction may be carried out in polar protic solvent such as water, MeOH, EtOH, or mixture thereof or etheral solvent like diethyl ether, THF and the like or mixtures thereof.<br>
Scheme-II refers to the synthesis of a-alkoxy-phosphonate analogues of formula (I). Suitably substituted aldehyde derivative (5) where A is as defined earlier, was treated with suitable trialkyl orthoformate of formula (6) as an acetalization reagent in the presence of suitable acidic catalyst such as PTSA, pivalic acid and the like at 50 °C to 80 °C to yield the corresponding acetal derivative (7), where A and R4 are as discussed earlier. Suitable acetalizing agents may be selected from triethyl orthoformate, trimethyl orthoformate and the like. Reacting the compound (7) with appropriate trialkyl phosphite of formula (8) where A, R1, R2 are as discussed earlier, in the presence of suitable Lewis acid catalyst in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether, THF and the like or mixtures thereof, yields the corresponding a-alkoxy-phosphonate analogues of formula (I), where all the symbols are as defined earlier. Suitable Lewis acid catalyst may be selected from but not limited to SnCU, TiCl4 and the like.<br>
Scheme-Ill refers to the synthesis of a-alkyl-phosphonate analogues. Suitably substituted alkyl phosphonate (9) where R1 and R2 are as defined earlier, was alkylated by suitable alkyl halide of formula (10) using bases such as LDA, NaHMDS, LiHMDS, NaH and like in the presence of inert solvent like THF, diethyl ether and the like or mixtures thereof, to obtain the corresponding alkylated derivative of formula (11) where R1 and R2 are as defined earlier. Further alkylation with alkyl halide of formula (12) under similar basic conditions gave compound of formula (lb) where A, R1 and R2 are as defined<br><br>
earlier. Alternatively, compound of formula (9) may be alkylated with suitable alkyl halide of formula (13) under similar basic conditions to get compound of formula (la) where A, Rt and R2 are as defined earlier.<br>

The compounds of the present invention have been tested for their biological activities by carrageenan foot paw edema test in male as well as female Wistar rats according to standard protocol described in literature (Winter et. al, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., Ill, 544, (1962); Otterness and Bliven, Laboratory Models for Testing NSAIDS, in Non¬steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs, (J. Lombardino, ed.1985). The protocol followed was as described below:<br>
Wistar rats obtained from the Experimental Animal Facility of Zydus Research. Centre. Animals were housed in an environmentally controlled rooms with food and water available ad-libitum. All the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Animals were divided into different groups, each group comprising of five-six animals. After an overnight fast, animals of the control group received vehicle only by oral gavage whereas animals of the other groups received different doses of the test substance(s). Each rat received same volume of the formulation<br><br>
i.e. 2 mL/kg on body weight basis. One hour after administration of the vehicle or test substance, all the animals received sub-planter injection of carrageenan (1 % w/v in saline). Paw volume was measured at 0, 1,3 and 5 hour after carrageenan injection. Anti¬inflammatory activity, expressed as % Inhibition in paw swelling was calculated by measuring change in paw volume at different time intervals after carrageenan injection vs corresponding 0 hr values using the following formula.<br>
(PVC - PVT)<br>
% inhibition = 	 X 100<br>
PVC<br>
Where<br>
PVC = Average change in Paw volume of control animals PVT = Average change in Paw volume of treated animals.<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibited 10 % - 95 % rat paw edema at a dose of 30 mg/kg. The compounds of the present invention possess analgesic property and are effective in neuropathy pain. The compounds of the present invention inhibit the COX-1 and COX-2 coenzymes to varying extents as found by human whole blood assay (C. Brideau, S. Kargman, S.Liu; Inflammation Research, 45,68-74 (1996))<br>
The inhibitory activities of representative compounds of the present invention are given in the following table:<br><br>
SI. No.	Compound No.	Dose<br>
(mg/kg)	% Inhibition of paw edema after 1 h<br>
1.	1	30	24.04<br>
2.	3	30	37.81<br>
3.	5	30	39<br>
4.	6	30	39.68<br>
5.	13	30	18.39<br>
6.	27	30	12.38<br>
7.	42	30	11.71<br><br>
8.	43	30	18.96<br>
9.	Celecoxib	30	33<br>
The compounds of the present invention lowered triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL and increased HDL and lowered serum glucose levels. This was demonstrated by in vivo animal experiments.<br>
A) Demonstration of in vivo efficacy of compounds:<br>
i)	Serum triglyceride and total cholesterol lowering activity in Swiss albino<br>
mice:<br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) were bred in Zydus animal house. All these animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25+1 °C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water ad libitum. SAM of 20-30 g body weight range were used.<br>
The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.001 to 50 mg / kg/ day dose for 6 days. The compound was administered after suspending it in 0.25 % CMC or dissolving it in water, when compound is water-soluble. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% of Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected on 0th day and in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 6th day of the treatment. The blood was collected in non heparinised capillary and the serum was analyzed for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergermeyer, H., O., Ed., 1963. 211-214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6: 24-27). Measurement of serum triglyceride and total cholesterol was done using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India). Formula for calculation:<br>
Percentage reduction in triglycerides/total cholesterol were calculated according to the formula:<br>
Percentage reduction (%) =<br><br><br>
OC = Zero day control group value   OT = Zero day treated group value TC = Test day control group TT = Test day treated group ii)       Cholesterol lowering activity in hypercholesterolemic rat models<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats stock bred in Zydus animal house were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25±1 °C. Rats of 100-150 g body weight range were used for the experiment. Animals were made hypercholesterolemic by feeding 1 % cholesterol and 0.5 % sodium cholate mixed with standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water ad libitum for 5 days. The animals were maintained on the same diet throughout the experiment [Petit D., Bonnefis M. T., Rey C and Infante R., Effects of ciprofibrate on liver lipids and lipoprotein synthesis in normal and hyperlipidemic rats, Atherosclerosis, 14, 215-225(1988)].<br>
The test compounds were administered orally at a dose 0.03 to 50 mg/ kg/ day for 4 days, after suspending it in 0.25 % CMC or dissolving it in water when compound is water-soluble. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25% of Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state on 0th and 1 hour after drug administration on 6th day of the treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through non-heparinised capillary and the serum samples were analyzed for triglyceride and total cholesterol using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India). LDL and HDL by commercial kits (Point Scientific, USA). LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride.<br>
The reduction in VLDL cholesterol is calculated according to the formula. VLDL cholesterol in mg/dl = Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - LDL cholesterol<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also suitable for the treatment of bone wasting diseases like osteoporosis and in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease events, vascular restenosis, diabetes and many other related conditions.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention have morphinomimetic action and so can be used to relieve pain, to induce constipation, to treat diarrhea or dysentery, for cough suppression, to induce sleep, for sedation, for induction of euphoria or the treatment of depression.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used in medical conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, dysmenorrhea, premature labour, nephritis, nephrosis, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, shock, cancer, and Alzheimer disease, wherein prostaglandins play a pathophysiological role.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful as inhibitors of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, reprolysin (also known as adamylsin) subfamilies and of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) activity.<br><br>
