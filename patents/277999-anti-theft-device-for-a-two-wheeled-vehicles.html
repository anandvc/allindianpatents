				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
<br>
The subject matter described herein, in general, relates to an anti-theft device for a two-wheeled vehicle and in particular, relates to a locking mechanism for a rider seat and a centre stand of the two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
<br>
Generally, two-wheeled vehicles or two-wheelers are prone to theft because of their relatively small size. Also, these vehicles can easily be dismantled by a miscreant and individual parts can be stolen if the vehicle is left unattended for some time at an unsafe or isolated place. Conventionally, a two-wheeled vehicle is safeguarded against theft by a steering lock mechanism present in the steering system of the vehicle. Although locking of the steering system provides basic safety to the vehicle, however, it does not ensure fool proof security.<br>
<br>
Another traditional way to secure a two-wheeled vehicle is to lock the centre stand on which the vehicle rests. This provides additional security to the two-wheeled vehicle as it makes the vehicle immobile. The centre stand is locked with the help of an additional locking device such as a pad lock or an integrated centre stand locking device. In such an anti-theft arrangement, the rider of the vehicle has to maintain a separate key for the centre stand lock in addition to having a steering lock key. Further, to lock or unlock the centre stand, the rider has to bend over to access the lock, which sometimes becomes cumbersome. For example, in a packed parking lot, the rider may be forced to leave the centre stand unlocked due to lack of sufficient space around the two-wheeled vehicle for him or her to bend over and lock the centre stand.<br>
<br>
Further, if pad locks are used, they have to be separately purchased and carried as an accessory since they are not an integral part of conventional two-wheeled vehicles. Therefore, additional locking devices such as the pad locks are not always user friendly and sometimes discourage the rider from using them.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY<br>
<br>
The subject matter described herein is directed towards an anti-theft device for a two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
<br>
According to one embodiment of the present subject matter, the anti-theft device for the safety of the two-wheeled vehicle, includes a main lock, a first locking mechanism, and a second locking mechanism. The first locking mechanism locks the rider seat at a substantially horizontal position and, on actuation, unlocks the rider seat. On the other hand, the second locking mechanism, on actuation, locks the centre stand at a substantially vertical position, thereby making the two-wheeled vehicle immobile.<br>
<br>
The main lock is fitted to a fender near a rear wheel and is used to operate both the first locking mechanism and the second locking mechanism. The main lock includes a cam such as a double slotted split cam. The main lock is connected to the first locking mechanism and the second locking mechanism through a first connecting means and a second connecting means, respectively. The first connecting means and the second connecting means move in accordance with the cam. The cam, when rotated by an external device in a first direction, actuates and unlocks the first locking mechanism and, when rotated in a second direction, which is opposite to the first direction, actuates and locks the second locking mechanism.<br>
<br>
Thus, the main lock, disposed at a convenient location on the fender of the two-wheeled vehicle, provides for conveniently securing the two-wheeled vehicle. Since the main lock is connected to both the first locking mechanism and the second locking mechanism, the rider can conveniently secure the two-wheeled vehicle by operating only the main lock. Moreover, the rider of the two-wheeler does not have to maintain separate keys for separate locks.<br>
<br>

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
The subject matter described herein is directed to an anti-theft device for a two-wheeled vehicle, interchangeably referred to as a two-wheeler hereinafter. The two-wheeler as described herein includes a frame resting on a rear and a front wheel, a steering handle, a centre stand, and a rider seat.<br>
<br>
According to one embodiment, the anti-theft device includes a main lock, a first locking mechanism, and a second locking mechanism. The main lock is fitted to a fender near the rear wheel. <br>
<br>
The main lock further includes a cam such as a double slotted split cam. The main lock is connected to the first locking mechanism and the second locking mechanism through a first connecting means and a second connecting means, respectively. The first connecting means and the second connecting means move in accordance with the cam. The cam, when rotated in a first direction and a second direction opposite to the first direction, actuates the first and the second locking mechanisms, respectively.<br>
 <br>
The first locking mechanism is provided on the frame and in the vicinity of the rider seat. The rider seat is disposed substantially above the rear wheel and is pivoted to the frame of the two-wheeled vehicle. The first locking mechanism locks the rider seat in a substantially horizontal position. Further, on actuation, the first locking mechanism unlocks the rider seat.<br>
<br>
The second locking mechanism is provided in the proximity of the centre stand of the two-wheeled vehicle. The centre stand is disposed between the two wheels of the two-wheeled vehicle. The second locking mechanism, on actuation, locks the centre stand in a substantially vertically operable position supporting the vehicle in a parking position, thereby making the two-wheeled vehicle immobile.<br>
<br>
Fig.l illustrates a perspective side view of a two-wheeled vehicle 100. According to an embodiment, the two-wheeled vehicle or the two-wheeler 100 includes a frame 102 that supports a front wheel 104 on a front end 106 and a rear wheel 108 on a rear end 110 of the two-wheeler 100. A steering means 112, which is also supported by the frame 102, is connected to the front wheel 104. A rider seat 114 is disposed substantially above the rear wheel 108 and is pivoted to an utility box 116 disposed underneath. Also, a centre stand 118 is disposed between the front wheel 104 and the rear wheel 108 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100.<br>
<br>
In order to safely park the two-wheeled vehicle 100, a main lock 120 is provided which is fitted to a fender 122 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100 at the rear end 110. The main lock 120 is used to lock and unlock both the rider seat 114 and the centre stand 118 using a single locking mechanism, which will be discussed in detail in the later part of the description.<br>
<br>
Fig.2 illustrates a side view of the frame 102 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100, as shown in Fig.l. The two-wheeled vehicle 100 includes an anti-theft device that includes the main lock<br>
 <br>
120, a first locking mechanism 202, and a second locking mechanism 204. The main lock 120 is fitted on the fender 122 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100 near the rear wheel 108. The main lock 120 separately actuates the first locking mechanism 202 and the second locking mechanism 204 when rotated in a particular direction.<br>
<br>
The first locking mechanism 202 is provided at the rear end 110 of the frame 102 and in the vicinity of the rider seat 114 (not shown in this figure). The first locking mechanism 202 locks the rider seat 114 in a substantially horizontal position 206 of the rider seat 114. The first locking mechanism 202, on actuation by the main lock 120, unlocks the rider seat 114 so that the rider seat 114 can be brought to a substantially vertical position 208. The rider seat 114, when moved upwards from the substantially horizontal position 206 to the substantially vertical position 208, uncovers the utility box 116 (not shown in this figure). The rider seat 114, when moved downward from the substantially vertical position 208 to the substantially horizontal position 206, gets locked automatically.<br>
<br>
Further, the second locking mechanism 204 is provided in the vicinity of the centre stand 118 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100. The second locking mechanism 204, on actuation by the main lock 120, locks the centre stand 118 in a substantially vertical position 210, thereby preventing the movement of the centre stand 118 to a substantially horizontal position 212. To unlock the centre stand 118, from the substantially vertical position 210 to the substantially horizontal position 212, the second locking mechanism 204 can be again actuated by the main lock 120. The first locking mechanism 202 and the second locking mechanism 204, also referred to as a seat latch 202 and a stand latch 204 respectively, may be used independent of each other.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Fig.3A illustrates a perspective view of the main lock 120 of the anti-theft device of the two-wheeled vehicle 100, according to one embodiment of the present subject matter. The main lock 120 is provided with a key hole 300 and is operated by a key 302. The key 302 is used to operate the main lock 120 by turning the key 302 inside the keyhole 300 in a first direction 304 or in a substantially opposite second direction 306. For purposes of discussion, the first direction 304 is a clockwise direction, while the second direction 306 is an anti-clockwise direction.<br>
<br>
The key 302 rotates to a first position 308 from a neutral position 310 when turned in the first direction 304. Similarly, the key 302 rotates to a second position 312 from the neutral position 310 when turned in the second direction 306. The neutral position 310 is disposed between the first position 308 and the second position 312. In one embodiment, the first position 308 can be, for example, at an angular displacement of 70 degrees in the first direction 304 from the neutral position 310. Further, the second position 312 can be, for example, at an angular displacement of 90 degrees in the second direction 306 from the neutral position 310. The key 302 can also be used to operate a steering and ignition system of the two-wheeled vehicle 100.<br>
<br>
Further, the main lock 120 is connected to the first locking mechanism 202 and the second locking mechanism 204. The aforesaid connections are made such that the first locking mechanism 202 and the second locking mechanism 204 are actuated when the key 302 is rotated inside the keyhole 300 towards the first position 308 and towards the second position 312 respectively.<br>
<br>
Fig.3B illustrates a sectional view of a double slotted split cam 314 of the main lock 120 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100, in the neutral position 310. The main lock 120, provided with the double slotted split cam 314, is connected to the first locking mechanism 202 and the second locking mechanism 204 by a first connecting means 316 and a second connecting means 318 respectively. The connections are made such that the first connecting means 316 and the second connecting means 318 move in accordance with the double slotted split cam 314. In a preferred embodiment, a first cable 316 and a second cable 318 can be used as the first connecting means 316 and the second connecting means 318, respectively. In one implementation of the above embodiment the first cable 316 and the second cable 318 are Single cables. In another implementation of the above embodiment the first cable 316 and the second cable 318 are Split cables.<br>
<br>
Fig.3C illustrates a sectional view of the double slotted split cam 314 of the main lock 120 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100, in the first position 308. Turning the key 302 to the first position 308 rotates the double slotted split cam 314 in the clockwise direction 304, thus pulling the first cable 316. The first cable 316, in turn, actuates and unlocks the first locking mechanism 202, which otherwise is always in a locked condition.<br>
<br>
Fig.3D illustrates a sectional view of the double slotted split cam 314 of the main lock 120 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100, in the second position 312. Turning the key 302 to the second position 312 rotates the double slotted split cam 314 in the anti-clockwise direction 306, thus pulling the second cable 318. The second cable 318 then actuates and locks the second locking mechanism 204, which otherwise is always in an unlocked condition, thereby locking the centre stand 118 in the substantially vertical position 210. Locking the centre stand 118 in the substantially vertical position 210 makes the two-wheeled vehicle 100 immobile. To move the two-wheeled vehicle 100 the centre stand 118 can be unlocked by turning the key from the second position 312 back to the neutral position 310. Turning the key from the second position<br>
 <br>
312 back to the neutral position 310 releases the pulled second cable 318 and thus unlocks the second locking mechanism 204.<br>
<br>
Fig.4A illustrates a sectional view of the second locking mechanism 204 in an unlocked condition. The second locking mechanism 204 includes a plunger 400, a post 402 fixed to the plunger 400, and a spring 404 for returning the plunger 400 back to its original position after unlocking. The post 402 connects the plunger 400 to the second cable 318 through a lever or linkage 406 such that when the double slotted split cam 314 pulls the second cable 318, the second cable 318 in turn pulls the plunger 400, thus actuating the second locking mechanism 204.<br>
<br>
Fig.4B illustrates a sectional view of the second locking mechanism 204 in a locked condition. The second locking mechanism 204 is actuated to the locked condition when the double slotted split cam 314 pulls the second cable 318. The second cable 318 in turn, pulls the plunger 400 such that the plunger 400 slides in the guiding means 408 and enters inside a stopper 410 provided in the centre stand 118. Thus, the centre stand 118 gets locked in the substantially vertical position 210.<br>
<br>
The present subject matter thus provides an easy and convenient to use anti-theft device. Using the main lock 120 for actuating the second locking mechanism 204 makes it convenient for the rider to lock the centre stand 118 without bending from his normal sitting position as the main lock 120 is fitted on the fender 122 near the rear end 110 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100.<br>
<br>
Further, a single key 302 can be used to operate the main lock 120 and the steering and ignition system of the two-wheeled vehicle 100, thus preventing any need of additional keys for the main lock 120. Moreover, as the main lock 120 actuates the entire anti-theft device, thus no separate keys are required for the first locking mechanism 202 and the second locking mechanism 204.<br>
<br>
In addition, no separate locking devices are required to be carried as accessories since the anti-theft device as described herein is integrated with the fender 122 of the two-wheeled vehicle 100.<br>
<br>
While certain features of the claimed subject matter have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes that fall within the true spirit of the claimed subject matter.<br>
