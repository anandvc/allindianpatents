DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF JOINT AND TISSUE INFLAMMATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The subject invention relates to medical method and apparatus and more particularly to apparatus and method for the detection and quantification of joint and tissue inflammation. Background of the Invention<br>
Most people by age 50 develop some degree of arthritis, Usually, this takes the form of degenerative joint disease, or osteoarthritis that eventually afflicts nearly everyone by the time they are 65 years old. Another form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, affects approximately 1% of the population with a prevalence that approaches 2% of males and 5% of females by age 65. When lupus, gout, infectious processes, metabolic processes, toxins, cancers, and the more than 100 other types of arthritis are added to these numbers, nearly everyone, if they live long enough, will suffer joint pain and arthritis. The ultimate prevalence of joint diseases is further increased by fractures, athletic injuries, neuromuscular disorders, and congenital deformities.<br>
Common to all of the various forms of joint diseases is the presence of inflammation. All forms of inflammation, from any cause, are characterized by five cardinal signs or manifestations comprising redness, swelling, heat, pain, and the loss of function of the involved tissue. The presence of inflammation in the involved joint or tissue indicates the presence of injury or disease, while the amount of inflammation in the injured, deformed, or arthritic joint or tissue is directly proportional to the amount of damage or disease in that joint and is inversely proportional to the degree of healing in the same joint. Accordingly, the physician or surgeon treating such musculoskeletal problems is constantly trying to detect any inflammation, and, if present, to assess the degree of this inflammation in order to determine whether disease or injury is occumng, how much disease or damage is present, and whether the problem is progressing or healing.<br>
Various methods and equipment have been developed for assessing the presence or absence of inflammation in joints and other tissues. Such methods and equipment include performing a physical examination of the involved tissue; blood tests, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level; radiographic tests, such as plain X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and research procedures, such as thermography.<br><br>
In performing a physical examination, the physician begins the method of assessing the presence or absence of inflammation by asking such questions as which joints or tissue areas are causing pain, how much pain is present and how often is the pain present. The physician will then perform a physical examination to determine if there is any redness, warmth, swelling, or stiffness in these areas, and to see if the patient is experiencing any limitation or loss of function. This method of questioning and physical examination of the patient, however, does not reliably establish the presence of inflammation. For example, redness over an area of pain could be a result of an overlying skin rash rather than inflammation or stiffness may be a result of a nearby muscle spasm as opposed to inflammation. Further, this method results in an assessment that is only crudely and inconsistently quantifiable. For example, the physician might ask, "If zero equals no pain and your pain level was a 10 out of 10 when you were first treated, at what level is your pain currently?" Such clinometric scales are generally inconsistent and results will vary depending, among other factors, on the manner in which the questions were asked, the physician asking the questions and the day and time the patient was questioned. Accordingly, such assessments are highly subjective and ultimately have no definite correlation with the actual degree of inflammation.<br>
in addition to determining the presence of inflammation, the physical examination may also provides some indicafion of the presence and degree of inflammation. The physician or surgeon, for example, may gently squeeze or palpate the involved joint or tissue to detect swelling, warmth, or tenderness. Even if the physician detects some amount of joint or tissue swelling by palpation, there is no precise and reproducible way of determining whether the swelling represents newly inflamed tissue or just residual thickened and scarred tissue from previous, now quiescent, inflammation. Detection of skin warmth is useful but cannot be quantified by simple palpation. The determination of tenderness is also useful but it only inconsistently correlates with actual inflammation. For example, the joint or tissue could be tender secondary to conditions that are not related to inflammation, such as poor circulation, diabetic-related or other causes of local nerve damage, foreign bodies, and other causes. The degree of tenderness is often assessed using a clinometric scale and has the same drawbacks as previous mentioned. The range of motion of a joint or muscle represents that tissue's functional state. Typically, the method of measuring the range of motion of a joint or muscle involves holding a plastic protractor next to the joint while the patient tries to<br><br>
move the joint or muscle in question. Unfortunately, problems of accuracy and reproducibility arise due to placement and stability of the protractor. It has been found that results of testing will vary even between tests performed by the same examiner on the same patient.<br>
The method of performing blood tests to assess the presence and degree of inflammation typically involves testing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels. Unfortunately, such tests are nonspecific and indicate changes taking place throughout the patient's body rather than to inflammatory changes taking place in localized areas, such as a knee or finger. Further, the results of the blood tests are uniformly subject to a wide variety of physical conditions and ailments that are not related to inflammation. For example, the blood count in a patient having significant arthritis or other forms of inflammatory disease may show elevations of the white blood cells or of other blood cells called "platelets." However, the white cell count can be elevated due to many conditions, such as leukemia, allergies, drug reactions, and numerous illnesses that have little or no relationship with inflammation. Similarly, the platelet count may be increased by noninflammatory conditions such as an iron deficiency or cancer. In addition, in many inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, such cell counts typically show no elevation.<br>
In the performance of another type of blood test commonly employed to detect inflammation, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the patient's anticoagulated blood sample is placed in a vertical glass or plastic capillary tube. After sitting for one hour, the height of the column of red blood cells that have settled to the bottom of the tube is measured. In general, the taller the column of red cells, the more inflammation exists in the patient's body. Unfortunately, this method has numerous problems. Similarly to the white blood cell and platelet tests mentioned above, the ESR may not show any elevation, even in the presence of clearly clinically detectable inflammation. This lack of elevation, or in some cases elevated levels not caused by inflammation, may be due to various conditions including anemia, sickled blood cells, bone marrow cancers, and diabetic kidney disease. Further, as with blood count tests, such methods only indicate the possibility of inflammation and reflect a systemic rather than a local situation.<br>
Another blood test used in detecting inflammation involves the measurement of a patient's C-reactive protein level (CRP).   Like the other blood tests used for detecting<br><br>
inflammation, CRP suffers from the lack of sensitivity, lack of specificity, and numerous confounding factors.<br>
As a result of the numerous difficulties associated with the various methods of assessing inflammation using blood tests and since these methods do not include measurement of the five above-mentioned markers of inflammation, such methods are indirect at best and only useful in obtaining adjuncts for detecting and quantifying inflammation.<br>
Methods for detecting inflammation using plain radiographs, such as plain X-rays, have proved to be inadequate. It has been found that if a patient has swelling capable of being shown in a X-ray, the swelling level would also be clinically evident on physical examination thereby rendering a X-ray unnecessary. In addition, any shadowy outline of a soft tissue bulge around a bone or joint indicating possible inflammation would be extremely nonspecific and may be produced by conditions that are unrelated to inflammation, such as obesity.<br>
Methods using computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are performed occasionally to observe swelling in various tissues. Such methods, however, are relatively expensive, may be insensitive to very mild degrees of inflammation, and generally do not detect forms of inflammation that involve only minimal or no swelling. Additionally, the CT scan uses ionizing radiation. Further, an MKl cannot be used for individuals having pacemakers or metallic implants located near the subject area. .Another problem with using CT and MRI scans is the difficulty of interpreting the results of the scans making them unsuitable for routine outpatient testing in a typical medical office or clinic.<br>
Methods of detecting inflammation using thermography or infrared photography have been used to try to detect inflammation. Unfortunately, however, thermography is relatively insensitive to mild degrees of inflammation; it cannot detect any of the signs of inflammation except warmth; it is difficult to reproduce due to changes in regional blood flow, for example caused by emotional states; and it is relatively expensive and technically difficult, requiring the patient to be unclothed and placed in a climate-controlled room where ambient temperature and humidity are assiduously constant and stabilized.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for a relatively inexpensive, reliable, reproducible, easy to use or perform, noninvasive method and apparatus for the detection and quantification of<br><br>
joint and tissue inflammation that may be used in medical offices, clinics, sports and training facilities, and the like. Disclosure of the Invention<br>

Referring to FIG. 2, a patient P being tested for joint and tissue inflammation is shown positioned such that the location L of the tissue or joint to be examined is appropriately positioned for measurement by the apparatus 100 of the present invention. The sensing component 102 includes a surface scanning element 118 having a digitizing scanner which is coupled for use with the device for detecting swelling 104 for dimensional measurement of the location L of the tissue or joint being examined for inflammation. Preferably, the surface scanning element 118 may comprise a flat bed scanner for providing two-dimensional images and measurement data of the location being examined, or multiple scanners, such as are used currently in the manufacture of high precision casting and machine components, for example, suitably oriented for providing three-dimensional images and measurement data of the area being examined. The device for detecting swelling 104 may also comprise various thermography devices, such as infrared imaging systems used for security identification, infrared inspection of electrical and mechanical components, or medical imaging. The device for detecting swelling 104 may also comprise high-resolution ultrasound or magnetic resonance systems, such as used in medical imaging.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, an example of the preferred embodiment of the invention is shown whereby the device for detecting swelling 104 is a conventional video-based digitizing scanning system which is coupled to the surface scanning element 118 of the sensing component 102. The surface scanning element 118 operates to collect data and transfer the data to the device for detecring swelling 104, such as by the use of an analog to a digital converter (not shown), which is coupled to the archival storage and retrieval device 114 that operates to store and analyze the collected data to generate measurements, and preferably a mathematical model or image indicative of the surface and cross-sectional dimensions of the joint or tissue at the location L.

The device 104 includes means for moving a light beam 122, such as a laser beam emitted from the surface scanning element 118 across the surface area of the location L being investigated. The surface scanning element<br><br>
118 collects data and transfers the data to the device for detecting swelling 104 which is coupled to the archival storage and retrieval device 114 that operates to store the collected data and to analyze the pattern of reflections and the characteristics of the beam spot pattern of reflections from the scanned location L to generate a model or image indicative of the surface and cross-sectional dimensions of the joint or tissue at the location L.

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device for detecting swelling 104 is a conventional position tracking based scanning system which is coupled to the sensing component 102 having a free-motion digitized surface scanning element 118. The position tracking system 126 detects the position of the surface scanning element 118 relative to a position reference magnetic field generated by a transmitter (not shown). In operanon, the tissue or joint at the location L is measured by pressing the surface scanning element 118 against the skin S of the patient P and moving the surface scanning element 118 over the surface of the joint or dssue to be scanned. The position tracking system 126 tracks the position and orientation of the surface scanning element 118 as it moves over the location<br><br>
L and is coupled to the archival storage and retrieval device 114 which receives and correlates data and generates the cross-sectional dimensions, and preferably an image, of the joint or tissue at the scanned location L.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the distance measuring device 124 (FIG. 3) is a non-contact probe, such as a laser distance measuring device, that measures the displacement between the surface scanning element 118 and the skin S of the patient P at the location L being scanned. The position of the surface scanning element 118 is directed by a position tracking system 126 (FIG. 3) by denoting the position of the surface scanning element 118 on the guide track 132 or the mechanical arm (not shown). In operation, the tissue or joint of the patient P is secured in place and the surface scanning element 118 is moved along the guide track 132 to scan the tissue or joint. The device for detecting swelling 104 tracks the position of the surface scanning element 118 and is conventionally coupled to the archival storage and retrieval device 114 which analyzes the scanned data and the position of the surface scanning element 118 and generates an image and cross-sectional dimensions of the tissue or joint at the scanned location L which is fed to the display device 116 for viewing.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1, 2, 3, and 4, the device for detecting swelling 104 is a high-resolution ultrasound device and is coupled to the sensing component 102 having an ultrasound emitter and receiver scanning element 118. The ultrasound emitter and receiver scanning element 118 may be a hand-held, free-motion surface scanning device (FIG, 2) or a restricted-motion scanning element<br><br>
utilizing a support structure 130 and a guide track 132 (FIG. 4). A conventional brace (not shown) may be used to hold the limb or other anatomic feature of the patient P being scanned during the scanning operation. A position tracking device 126 may be attached to the device for detecting swelling 104 (FIG. 3) to determine the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe 118 within a position reference field. In operation, ultrasonic beams from the scanning element 118 are emitted through and then reflected back from the tissue of the patient P at the location L. The nature of degree of, and the rapidity of the reflected ultrasound signal detected by the receiver sensor of the surface scanning element 118 are transmitted to the device for detecting swelling 104 which is coupled to the archival storage and retrieval device 114. The archival storage and retrieval device 114 conventionally analyzes these data and generates the cross-sectional dimensions, preferably a model or image, of the scanned joint or tissue area at the location L, and this is fed to the display device 116 for viewing. Additionally, the nature and characteristics of the reflected ultrasound signal detected by the receiver sensor of the surface scanning element 118 and transmitted by the device for detecting swelling 104 to the archival storage and retrieval device 114 could be analyzed using a separate analyzer (not shown), such as a computer or a program, to determine the location and degree of inflammation via various propenies, such as the particular echogenicity, of the reflected ultrasonic signal.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1, 3, and 4, the device for detecting swelling 104 is a conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The sensing component 102 is a conventional magnetic resonance imaging coil and preferably is a restricted motion scanning element using a support structure 130 and a guide track structure 132 (FIG. 4). A conventional brace (not shown) may be used to hold the limb or other anatomic feature of the patient P being scanned. The magnetic resonance field is conventionally onented and located in a reference spatial grid as with all conventional IVIRI devices. In operation, magnetically generated images or dimensions from the anatomy of the patient P at the location L are transmitted from the surface scanning element 118 to the device for detecting swelling 104 and this in turn is conventionally coupled to the archival storage and retrieval device 114. The archival storage and retrieval device 114 operates to conventionally analyze these MJU data and generate the cross-sectional dimensions, and preferably a model or image, of the area of the scanned joint or tissue at the location L.<br><br>
These analyzed data are thi n fed to the display device 116 for viewing. Additionally, the nature and characteristics of the returned MRI signal detected by the surface scanning element 118 can be analyzed by the archival storage and retrieval device 114 to determine the location and degree of inflammation via various properties of the MRI signal.<br>
It should now be apparent to those skilled in the art that the imaging system 104 of the subject invention can be formed from various types of conventional dimensional measuring or imaging systems that are capable of producing detailed images and/or measurement of surfaces. Preferably, such systems should be such that they are easily adapted for use in developing detailed measurements, and preferably computerized models or images, of the joints or tissue. It should also now be apparent to those skilled in the art that other types of systems, such as wraps, cuffs, or sleeves having one or a plurality of location sensors may be used for placement about a joint or tissue area.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 5, the imaging system 104 comprises mechanical calipers 133.

The temperature<br><br>
measuring device 110 correlates the data and compares the data to a standard or a reference, such as previous temperature measurements at that location L, and the difference in the intensity of the infrared light can be used to calculate the temperature and the change in temperature of the scanned location L. The temperature measuring device 110 is coupled to the^ archival storage and retrieval device 114 for calculating temperature changes and for archival storage and retrieval of the temperature data and for comparing the data to a standard or to a reference, such as previously taken measurements of the subject location L, for determining an increase or a decrease in inflammation.

S of the patient P can be measured.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the surface scanning element 118 includes a conventional skin surface electrical conductance/resistance probe, similar to those in polygraph systems, comprising two electrodes which are placed in direct contact with the skin of the patient. In operation, the electrodes are provided with electric current that flows between them and changes in the conductance/resistance of the flow caused by insensible sweating at the location is measured. Since tissue temperature changes cause variations in insensible sweating and thus skin moisture, changes in skin electrical conductance/resistance occur and from these changes the temperature at the location of the probe can be derived using the archival storage and retrieval device 114.<br>
It should now be apparent to those skilled in the art that the temperature measuring device 110 of the subject invention can be formed from various types of conventional temperature measuring devices that are capable of measuring the temperature of a surface. Such devices may include conventional medical thermography instrumentation, microwave thermography instrumentation for measuring natural radiation, infrared scanners, laser scanners, thermometers, resistance temperature detectors, thermistor temperature sensors, and thermocouple temperature sensors.

In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the sensing component 102 includes a probe 142, for producing discrete electrical stimuli. The probe 142 comprises a metal tip which is effective for electrically stimulating the tissue of the patient P at the location L. The electrical stimulus necessary to produce pain at the location L is determined via a button or other triggering device (not shown) which the patient P activates when the applied electrical stimulus becomes painful, and this stimulus level is then fed to the pain detection system 112 which then calculates the amount of electrical stimuli to determine the pain threshold and tolerance at the location L and this is transmitted to the archival storage and retrieval device 114 for archival storage and retrieval and for analysis and is fed into the display 116 for viewing.<br>

Accordingly, any two or more of the five cardinal signs or manifestations comprising redness, swelling, heat, pain, and the loss of function of<br><br>
the involved tissue, common to inflammation, can be recorded and analyzed by the examining physician, trainer, or health care worker. The presence of inflammation in the involved joint or tissue can be used as an indication of the presence of injury or disease, while the amount of inflammation in the injured, deformed, or arthritic joint or tissue can be used to determine the amount of damage or disease in that joint and whether the problem is progressing or healing.<br>
