FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to wireless telecommunications, and particularly to point-<br>
to-multipoint transmissions in a wireless telecommunications network.<br>
RELATED ART AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS<br>
In a typical cellular radio system, wireless terminals, often called mobile stations or user<br>
equipment units (UEs), communicate via a radio access network to one or more core<br>
networks. The wireless terminals can be mobile stations such as mobile telephones<br>
("cellular" telephones) and laptops with mobile termination, and thus can be, for example,<br>
portable, pocket, hand-held, computer-included, or car-mounted mobile devices which<br>
communicate voice and/or data with radio access network. Alternatively, the wireless user<br>
equipment units can be fixed wireless devices, e.g., fixed cellular devices/terminals which<br>
are part of a wireless local loop or the like.<br>
The radio access network covers a geographical area which is divided into cell areas, with<br>
each cell area being served by a base station. A cell is a geographical area where radio<br>
coverage is provided by the radio base station equipment at a base station site. Each cell is<br>
identified by a unique identity, which is broadcast in the cell. The base stations<br>
communicate over the air interface (e.g., radio frequencies) with the mobile stations within<br>
range of the base stations. In the radio access network, several base stations are typically<br>
connected (e.g., by landlines or microwave) to a base station controller (BCS) node,<br>
sometimes termed a radio network controller (RNC). The base station controller<br>
supervises and coordinates various activities of the plural base stations connected thereto.<br>
The base station controllers are typically connected to one or more core networks.<br>
One example of a radio access network is the Global System for Mobile communications<br>
(GSM) developed in Europe. Other types of telecommunications systems which<br>
encompass radio access networks include the following: Advance Mobile Phone Service<br>
(AMPS) system; the Narrowband AMPS system (NAMPS); the Total Access<br><br>
Communications System (TACS); the Personal Digital Cellular (PDS) system; the<br>
United States Digital Cellular (USDC) system; the wideband code division multiple access<br>
(WCDMA) system; and the code division multiple access (CDMA) system described in<br>
EIA/TIA IS-95.<br>
In GSM systems the robustness of the radio signal is influenced by two factors: the<br>
modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the transmit power. Higher transmit power<br>
makes the radio signal more error resilient but generates interference in the system,<br>
thereby disturbing other radio links. Furthermore, the available transmit power per base<br>
station is limited. Different Modulation and Coding Schemes use different code rates to<br>
protect the user data. MCSs with little parity provide high data rates but low robustness<br>
and are therefore chosen in case of good radio conditions. However, if the radio<br>
conditions are poor an MCS using stronger coding must be used at the cost of lower data<br>
rates seen by higher layers.<br>
In a point-to-multipoint transmission mode, data (e.g., a video clip) is transmitted to<br>
several mobile stations on a common downlink channel (a so-called point-to-multipoint<br>
channel). Depending on the positions of the mobile stations in the cell and their respective<br>
radio conditions, each of the mobile stations will likely experience different link quality<br>
for the common downlink channel involved in the point-to-multipoint transmission. If the<br>
network is unaware of the position and conditions of the mobile stations, the coding<br>
scheme utilized for the point-to-multipoint transmission on the common downlink channel<br>
must be preconfigured to cope with a worst case link condition that could occur in that<br>
particular radio cell. This would guarantee sufficient quality for all mobile stations<br>
independent of their position in the cell. Unfortunately, also the mobiles with good radio<br>
link quality suffer from the decreased data rate provided on the point-to-multipoint<br>
channel. And even if all active mobiles in the cell experience good radio quality, radio<br>
resources are wasted by transmitting unnecessary parity information.<br>
To increase the bit rate (depending on the actual radio conditions of all active receivers),<br>
the mobile stations could separately send information over individual feedback channels to<br>
apprise the network of their perception of the link quality of point-to-multipoint<br><br>
transmission over the common downlink channel. The network could then adapt the coding scheme to the<br>
actual link quality of the worst mobile station. Unfortunately, having individual feedback channels for each<br>
mobile station is impractical, especially if there are many mobile stations receiving the same data in a point-<br>
to-multipoint transmission.<br>
WO-A-03/094554 describes a point-to-multipoint (PTM) services in wireless communication systems, and<br>
discloses that a modulation and coding set (MCS) selection device in a Node B receives channel quality<br>
measurements/information from each of the users registered to receive the PTM service, to select a MCS<br>
for the HS-DSCH transmission ([0030]).<br>
US-A-2003/207696D2 describes a method and arrangement for implementing MBMS services in a wireless<br>
network using coding schemes based on monitored traffic and capacity requirements. D2 describes a<br>
"statistical reporting scheme" where service quality information is collected from a selected group of UEs<br>
instead of all UEs, in order to reduce the overhead traffic associated with measurement reporting. The UEs<br>
which are selected to report may, for instance, be randomly selected ([0237]). However, none of the above<br>
documents teaches random selection of a time slot from a specified number of plural time slots on the<br>
common random access uplink channel<br>
What is needed, therefore, and an object of the present invention, is a technique for efficiently adapting the<br>
coding scheme for a common downlink channel carrying a point-to-multipoint transmission.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
A network node of a wireless telecommunication network uses a first coding scheme (selected from plural<br>
possible coding schemes) for encoding of a point-to-multipoint (PTM) transmission carried to plural mobile<br>
stations on a common downlink channel. The mobile stations receiving the point-to-multipoint transmission<br>
on the common downlink channel evaluate the link quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission. Feedback<br>
from the plural mobile stations regarding the link quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission is provided to<br>
the network node on a common uplink channel. A controller at the network node monitors information<br>
received on the common uplink channel for feedback regarding the link quality of the point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission. The controller at the network node uses the feedback to determine whether to change from<br>
the first coding scheme to a second coding scheme for the encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission<br>
to the plural mobile stations.<br>
If a mobile station (such as a mobile station at a cell border) determines the link quality of the point-to-<br>
multipoint transmission to be poor, such complaining mobile station sends a signal (e.g., burst) on the<br>
common uplink channel. Upon detecting the signal indicative of a complaint on the common uplink channel,<br>
in one mode of operation the controller of the network node chooses a more robust coding scheme as the<br>
second coding scheme for the encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission to the plural mobile stations.<br><br>
In another mode of operation, when the feedback received on the common uplink channel<br>
fails to provide any complaint regarding link quality within a predetermined time interval,<br>
the controller of the network node changes the encoding of the point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission from the first coding scheme to the second coding scheme (in this case the<br>
second coding scheme being a less robust coding scheme than the first coding scheme).<br>
In yet another mode of operation, the controller of the network node changes the encoding<br>
from the first coding scheme to the second (more robust) coding scheme only when the<br>
feedback includes an indication that a sufficient number of the mobile stations are<br>
complaining regarding link quality. As one example technique of implementing this<br>
mode, a specified number of plural time slots received on the common uplink channel are<br>
formed or associated together into a reporting group. When a mobile station determines<br>
that it needs to complain about link quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission, a<br>
signal indicative of the complaint is made in one of the plural time slots forming the<br>
reporting group. Preferably, the particular time slot in which the mobile station is<br>
permitted to send the signal indicative of the complaint is randomly determined.<br>
The controller of the network node then obtains an estimate of a number of the mobile<br>
stations that are complaining regarding link quality by ascertaining how many of the plural<br>
time slots in the reporting group include a signal indicative of a complaint. The controller<br>
of the network node compares the estimate to a predetermined trigger value, and changes<br>
the encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission from the first coding scheme to the<br>
second coding scheme when the estimate equals or exceeds the predetermined trigger<br>
value (the second coding scheme being a more robust coding scheme than the first coding<br>
scheme).<br>
In one mode of operation, the common uplink channel is a random access channel, and<br>
preferably a PRACH channel.<br>
The mobile station is configured to operate in a wireless telecommunication network, and<br>
comprises a receiver which receives from a network node the encoded point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission carried on a common downlink channel. A controller of the mobile station<br>
monitors link quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission and causes provision of the<br><br>
feedback regarding the link quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission on the<br>
common uplink channel to a network node.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific<br>
details are set forth such as particular architectures, interfaces, techniques, etc. in order to<br>
provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent<br><br>
to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other<br>
embodiments that depart from these specific details. In other instances, detailed<br>
descriptions of well-known devices, circuits, and methods are omitted so as not to obscure<br>
the description of the present invention with unnecessary detail. Moreover, individual<br>
function blocks are shown in some of the figures. Those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that the functions may be implemented using individual hardware circuits, using software<br>
functioning in conjunction with a suitably programmed digital microprocessor or general<br>
purpose computer, using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and/or using<br>
one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br>
Fig. 1 shows example portions of a mobile communications system 20 which are useful<br>
for illustrating concepts involved in a link quality monitoring procedure for a point-to-<br>
multipoint transmission. Fig. 1 specifically shows a cell 22 which is served by a base<br>
station (BS) 24. The base station (BS) 24 is connected by a physical link 26 (e.g., a<br>
landline or microwave link) to a base station controller (BSC) 28. It will be appreciated<br>
that base station controller (BSC) 28 may be connected to many other unillustrated base<br>
stations, as well as to other (unillustrated) base station controllers and to core network<br>
nodes.<br>
Fig. 1 further depicts that a point-to-multipoint transmission is occurring from base station<br>
controller (BSC) 28 to plural mobile stations 30 in cell 22. The point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission occurs on a common downlink channel 32 (illustrated by a dotted line in Fig.<br>
1), and is encoded at base station controller (BSC) 28 with one of plural possible coding<br>
schemes. The common downlink channel 32 is depicted in Fig. 1 as extending from base<br>
station controller (BSC) 28 to plural mobile stations 301 through 308. The common<br>
downlink channel 32 is physically carried over physical link 26 from base station<br>
controller (BSC) 28 to base station (BS) 24, and over the air (e.g., radio frequency)<br>
interface from base station (BS) 24 to the plural mobile stations 301 through 308.<br>
In the particular mobile communications system 20 shown in Fig. 1, encoding of the point-<br>
to-multipoint transmission occurs at base station controller (BSC) 28. In another type of<br>
radio access network, it is possible that encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission<br>
may occur at another type of network node, or a node having another appellation.<br><br>
Accordingly, it should be understood that the base station controller (BSC) 28 is just one<br>
example, representative type of network node which can be involved in the point-to-<br>
multipoint transmission.<br>
The number (eight) of mobile stations 30 involved in the particular point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission depicted in Fig. 1 is merely an illustrative example. The number of mobile<br>
stations involved in any particular point-to-multipoint transmission can be a greater or<br>
lesser number. Moreover, the types of equipment comprising the mobile stations can vary<br>
from terminal to terminal, provided that the mobile stations are otherwise configured to<br>
operate in accordance with the link quality monitoring procedure for a point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission as generally described herein.<br>
The plural mobile stations 301 through 308 receiving the point-to-multipoint transmission<br>
on the common downlink channel each evaluate the link quality of the point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission. Feedback from the plural mobile stations 301 through 308 regarding the link<br>
quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission is provided to the network node on a<br>
common uplink channel 36. Even though all mobile stations could send uplink feedback<br>
on common uplink channel 36, it is more likely that only one (or a few) mobiles do<br>
actually send a signal at any given time. The common uplink channel 36 is shown in Fig.<br>
1 as a dashed double dotted line originating from each of the mobile stations 30 and<br>
terminating at the base station controller (BSC) 28. In the same manner as the common<br>
downlink channel 32, the common uplink channel 36 is physically carried over the air<br>
interface from the mobile stations 30 to base station (BS) 24, and over physical link 26<br>
from base station (BS) 24 to base station controller (BSC) 28.<br>
In a manner such as the example manner hereinafter explained, the network node (base<br>
station controller (BSC) 28 in the example of Fig. 1) monitors information received on the<br>
common uplink channel 36 for feedback regarding the link quality of the point-to-<br>
multipoint transmission. The network node 28 uses the feedback to determine whether to<br>
change from a current coding scheme (e.g., a first coding scheme) to another (e.g., a<br>
second coding scheme) for the encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission to the<br>
plural mobile stations 30.<br><br>
If a mobile station (such as a mobile station 305 at or near a border of cell 22) determines<br>
the link quality of the point-to-multipoint transmission to be poor, as shown in Fig. 4 such<br>
complaining mobile station sends a signal (e.g., burst 40) on the common uplink channel<br>
36. Upon detecting the signal indicative of a complaint on the common uplink channel 36,<br>
in one mode of operation the network node 28 chooses a more robust coding scheme as<br>
the second coding scheme for the encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission to the<br>
plural mobile stations 30.<br>
Fig. 2 shows both a relevant portion of an example mobile station 30 and a base station<br>
controller 28 which are involved in a point-to-multipoint transmission over common<br>
downlink channel 32. The base station controller (BSC) 28 includes a radio link control<br>
(RLC)/medium access control (MAC) functional unit 44 which operates in layer 2 of the<br>
International Standards Organization (OSI) Open Systems Interconnection Reference<br>
model. Furthermore, it includes radio resource control (RRC) entity 46, which further<br>
includes a Multimedia Broadcast &amp; Multicast Service (MBMS)/Link Quality Control<br>
(MBMS/LQC) controller 48. The network also has an unillustrated physical layer which<br>
resides, e.g., in a base station (not depicted).<br>
The mobile station 30 comprises a receiver which also includes physical layer (layer 1)<br>
entity 53, as well as a radio link control (RLC)/medium access control (MAC) functional<br>
unit 54 (RLC and MAC are sublayers of layer 2). Furthermore, mobile station 30 includes<br>
radio resource control entity 56, which further includes a Multimedia Broadcast &amp;<br>
Multicast Service (MBMS)/Link Quality Control (MBMS/LQC) requestor 58.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flowchart illustrating basic example steps involved in one mode of a link quality<br>
monitoring procedure for a point-to-multipoint transmission. Steps framed by the broken<br>
line in Fig. 3 and ensuing figures are those which primarily involve handling of the<br>
common uplink quality control channel. Step 3-1 depicts receipt of a request for data<br>
services to be provided to plural mobile stations 30. Upon receipt of the request of step 3-<br>
1, as step 3-4 the controller 48 establishes the common downlink channel 32 with an initial<br>
coding scheme. The initial coding scheme is one of plural available coding schemes. The<br><br>
initial coding scheme can be set as a system parameter. Alternatively, the initial coding<br>
scheme can be pre-defined as a parameter on a cell basis (e.g., a pre-defined, per-cell<br>
parameter). As another alternative, the network node can perform an algorithm that sets<br>
the initial coding scheme to an optimal value based on previous feedback (over the course<br>
of a long time period, e.g., weeks or months).<br>
In addition to establishing the common downlink channel (step 3-4), as step 3-5 the<br>
network node establishes the common uplink channel 36. The common uplink channel 36<br>
is also known as the quality control channel. In one example implementation the common<br>
uplink channel 36 is preferably a random access channel, such as a Packet Random Access<br>
Channel (PRACH).<br>
After establishing both the common downlink channel 32 and the common uplink channel<br>
36, a process 3-7 of transmitting data over the common downlink channel 32 for the point-<br>
to-multipoint transmission to the mobile stations 30 is initiated by radio resource control<br>
(RRC) entity 46 and performed by radio link control (RLC)/medium access control<br>
(MAC) functional unit 44. While the process 3-7 of transmitting data over the common<br>
downlink channel 32 is performed, a monitoring process depicted by step 3-8 is also<br>
performed by radio link control (RLC)/medium access control (MAC) functional unit 44.<br>
The process of step 3-8 is a process of monitoring the common uplink quality control<br>
channel (i.e., common uplink channel 36) to determine if the common uplink channel 36<br>
contains a downswitch request, i.e., any signal (e.g., a burst) which indicates that a mobile<br>
station is complaining about link quality on the common downlink channel 32.<br>
A complaint about link quality on the common downlink channel 32 may arise from a<br>
mobile station which is far from the base station 24 and thus near a cell border, such as<br>
mobile station 305 in Fig. 1. If it turns out that common uplink channel 36 does contain a<br>
downswitch request or similar complaint (determined at step 3-9), the downswitch request<br>
is referred to controller 48. Upon receipt of a downswitch request, as indicated by step 3-<br>
11 the controller 48 chooses a more robust coding scheme for the point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission being carried on common downlink channel 32. Then, as shown by step 3-12<br>
(see also Fig. 2), the network node controller 48 directs the radio link control<br><br>
(RLC)/medium access control (MAC) functional unit 44 to start to use the new (more<br>
robust) coding scheme for the transmit process (depicted by step 3-7). The channel coding<br>
is actually performed by the physical layer (which is in the base station), but the<br>
RLC/MAC, when told to use the new coding scheme, requests encoding with the new<br>
coding scheme from the physical layer. The new, more robust coding scheme for common<br>
downlink channel 32 is thus thereafter utilized for all mobile stations 30 participating in<br>
the point-to-multipoint transmission.<br>
If the process 3-8 of monitoring the common uplink channel 36 does not encounter a<br>
downswitch request (step 3-9), the monitoring process (step 3-8) continues until all data<br>
for the point-to-multipoint transmission is completed (step 3-16). When all data included<br>
in the point-to-multipoint transmission has been transmitted, both the common downlink<br>
channel 32 is closed (step 3-17) and the common uplink channel 36 is closed (step 3-18).<br>
A downswitch request or similar complaint is originated by a mobile station 30 and carried<br>
on common uplink channel 36 when the mobile station 30 determines that the link quality<br>
of the point-to-multipoint transmission as carried on common downlink channel 32 is<br>
poor. A determination of the common downlink channel 32 being a poor quality link can<br>
be based on, e.g., the number of bit errors and/or the number of block errors. The number<br>
of bit errors and/or the number of block errors can be detected or determined by either<br>
physical layer (layer 1) entity 53 or radio link control (RLC)/medium access control<br>
(MAC) functional unit 54, which provide a measurement report (as indicated by arrows 2-<br>
1 and 2-2, respectively) to radio resource control entity 56, and particularly to RRC<br>
requestor 58. The measurement report can be, for example, a MBMS LQC measurement<br>
report. Upon receipt of the measurement report, requestor 58 of the mobile station may<br>
cause the downswitch request or similar complaint to be carried on common uplink<br>
channel 36 to network node 28, depending on the contents of the measurement report. The<br>
requestor 58 may process the measurement reports received from the physical layer or<br>
RLC/MAC prior to deciding whether to send a downswitch request. This processing may<br>
involve averaging over time, filtering, comparing bit error rate or block error rate with a<br>
predetermined or fixed threshold etc. There may even be a threshold configured that has<br>
to be exceeded before sending the downswitch or complaint to network node 28.<br>
As indicated above, the common uplink channel 36 can be any common uplink channel,<br><br>
such as a random access known as PRACH. The downswitch request can be any signal<br>
recognized as a complaint regarding quality of the common downlink channel 32 which<br>
carries the point-to-multipoint transmission. For example, a Temporary Block Flow<br>
(TBF) can be setup to send a downswitch request control message from the complaining<br>
mobile station 30 to the radio resource control entity 46 in network node 28. A Temporary<br>
Block Flow (TBF) is a logical connection between two RLC/MAC entities, with the MAC<br>
in the network node 28 using the Temporary Block Flow (TBF) to schedule uplink and<br>
downlink resources. Alternatively, and as illustrated by Fig. 4, as another one example<br>
implementation the downswitch request may take the form of a "burst", such as a random<br>
access burst 70. The downswitch request utilizes a fixed or predetermined number of bits<br>
per random access burst, with a unique bit pattern which identifies the burst as a<br>
downswitch request burst (to distinguish from other types of bursts or signals).<br>
In general, random access (RA) bursts are used to send information on a channel with a<br>
time slot structure when the timing of the slot boundaries is not exactly known to the<br>
mobile station (MS). To avoid the sent burst overlapping a slot boundary, the RA burst<br>
has to be significantly shorter than the slot. For the downswitch request burst 70 here<br>
described, the timing of the slot boundaries is roughly known by the mobile station 30<br>
since it receives bursts transmitted in the downlink on common downlink channel 32<br>
(which has the same timeslot structure). The exact timing is not known since the distance<br>
between the network node 28 and the mobile station 30, and hence the propagation delay,<br>
is unknown.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a GSM-type time slot structure for common uplink channel 36, with each<br>
time slot 72 being 156.25 symbols long. In one example implementation, the burst 70 is<br>
88 symbols in length, and has the example format shown in Fig. 4. In particular, the<br>
example burst 70 of Fig. 4 comprises an eight bit header 4-1; a field of forty one<br>
synchronization sequence bits 4-2; a payload field 4-3 of thirty six bits; and, a trailer or tail<br>
field 4-4 of three bits. In this example, the payload field 4-3 includes eight information<br>
bits plus channel coding (the channel coding being used to enable recovery of the eight<br>
information bits should some of the bits of the payload field be corrupted).<br>
A downswitch request burst such as burst 70 of Fig. 4 need not really carry any<br>
information at all, and does not necessarily bear any identification of the mobile station<br><br>
which sent the downswitch request burst. The mere fact that a downswitch request burst<br>
is received by the network node 28 provides the network node 28 with what it needs to<br>
know: that a mobile station participating in the point-to-multipoint transmission was<br>
unhappy or unsatisified with link quality.<br>
In the simplified mode of Fig. 3, lack of any complaint or downswitch request does not<br>
have any appreciable effect on the coding scheme. Another mode of operation of the link<br>
quality monitoring procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3A. In the Fig. 3A mode, when the<br>
feedback received on the common uplink channel 36 fails to provide any complaint<br>
regarding link quality within a predetermined time interval, the network node changes the<br>
encoding of the point-to-multipoint transmission from the first coding scheme to the<br>
second coding scheme (in this mode the second coding scheme is a less robust coding<br>
scheme than the first coding scheme). Thus, on the basis of lack of complaints from the<br>
mobile stations, the mode of Fig. 3 A attempts to increase bit rate and thus efficiency to the<br>
extent possible until a complaint, or a sufficient number of complaints, are received.<br>
The steps of the mode of operation of the link quality monitoring procedure illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3 A are generally the same as those of the mode of Fig. 3 (and accordingly are<br>
similarly numbered), with the addition of step 3-6, step 3-13 and steps 3-14 through 3-15.<br>
Step 3-6, performed prior to the monitoring process of step 3-8, involves initializing a<br>
timer. The timer essentially keeps track of the length of time for which no complaint or<br>
downswitch request is received from a mobile station on common uplink channel 36<br>
regarding the link quality of common downlink channel 32. The no-complaint timer,<br>
initialized at step 3-6, runs from initialization until it is re-initialized (as at step 3-13, in<br>
conjunction with choosing a more robust coding scheme) or until the timer expires.<br>
Steps 3-14 and 3-15 of the Fig. 3A mode of operation are performed when the (periodic)<br>
check at step 3-9 for a downswitch request is negative. If the check at step 3-9 for a<br>
downswitch request is negative, at step 3-14 a further inquiry is made whether the no-<br>
complaint timer has expired. If the no-complaint timer has not expired, the monitoring<br>
process (step 3-8) continues, with periodic checks being made (at step 3-16) to determine<br>
whether all data for the point-to-multipoint transmission has been completed. If, on the<br>
other hand, it is determined at step 3-14 that the no-complaint timer has expired, step 3-15<br>
and step 3-13 are performed. In particular, the lack of complaint from any mobile station<br><br>
over the elapsed time period clocked by the no-complaint timer induces the network node<br>
controller 48 to choose a less robust coding scheme (step 3-15). Upon choosing of the less<br>
robust coding scheme, the network node controller 48 directs the radio link control<br>
(RLC)/medium access control (MAC) functional unit 44 which is performing the transmit<br>
process (step 3-7) to require the physical layer (layer 1) to start using the new (less robust)<br>
coding scheme for the point-to-multipoint transmission (step 3-12). Upon implementing<br>
the less robust coding scheme, the no-complaint timer is also re-initialized at step 3-13.<br>
If it turns out that the less robust coding scheme results in a complaint or downswitch<br>
request from one (or a predetermined number) of the mobile stations, then a mode such as<br>
that depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 3 A may be implemented in order to return to a more robust<br>
coding scheme. In such case, a time delay or other protection feature may be required to<br>
prevent a ping-pong effect between coding schemes, so that a sufficient time elapses or<br>
other event occurs before the network node controller 48 again attempts to implement a<br>
less robust coding scheme. This functionality is depicted in Fig. 3A.<br>
In another mode of operation, illustrated by way of example with reference to Fig. 3B, the<br>
controller 48 of the network node 28 counts the number of mobile stations requesting<br>
participation in a point-to-multipoint transmission in order first to determine whether it is<br>
more efficient to set up a point-to-multipoint transmission on a common downlink channel<br>
such as common downlink channel 32, or instead to set up individual downlink channels<br>
(e.g., point-to-point (PTP) channels) to each mobile station requesting the service that<br>
otherwise would be conveyed in the point-to-multipoint transmission. The steps of the<br>
mode of operation of Fig. 3B are generally the same as those of the mode of Fig. 3 (and<br>
accordingly are similarly numbered), with the addition of step 3-2 and step 3-4.<br>
As step 3-2, which follows step 3-1, the network node 28 determines the number of mobile<br>
stations requesting the data that could be carried in a point-to-multipoint transmission, and<br>
then determines whether the number of requesting mobile stations in the cell is less than a<br>
predetermined efficiency threshold. Determination of the number of mobile stations can<br>
be performed in various ways, such as that described in Stage 2 of UTRAN MBMS: 3 GPP<br>
TS 25.346 Introduction of Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) in the Radio<br>
Access Network (RAN). If it is determined at step 3-2 that the number of requesting<br>
mobile stations in the cell is less than a predetermined efficiency threshold, then as step 3-<br><br>
3 the network node 28 establishes a point-to-point (PTP) channel for each mobile station.<br>
While establishment of the point-to-point (PTP) channel for each mobile station uses more<br>
bandwidth (because of the several channels involved), the bit rate can be individually<br>
adjusted for each mobile station depending on the respective radio link quality.<br>
Otherwise, if the number of requesting mobile stations is sufficiently high to warrant a<br>
point-to-multipoint transmission and thereby save spectral bandwidth, the point-to-<br>
multipoint transmission is setup and performed (along with the link quality monitoring<br>
procedure) as previously described by way of example with respect to Fig. 3.<br>
As a variation of the mode of Fig. 3B, monitoring or enumeration of the number of mobile<br>
stations participating in the point-to-multipoint transmission can be performed throughout<br>
the transmission process depicted by step 3-7. In such case, steps such as step 3-2 can be<br>
performed as an on-going part of the transmit process of step 3-7. If it is then determined<br>
during the transmission procedure of step 3-7 that the number of mobile stations<br>
participating in the point-to-multipoint transmission falls below the efficiency threshold,<br>
the network node 28 can terminate the point-to-multipoint transmission and instead switch<br>
the participating mobile stations from the common downlink channel 32 to separate point-<br>
to-point channels for continued reception of the data that otherwise would have been sent<br>
via the point-to-multipoint transmission.<br>
In another mode of operation, illustrated by way of example with reference to Fig. 3C, the<br>
controller 48 of the network node 28 changes the encoding from the first coding scheme to<br>
the second (more robust) coding scheme only when the feedback includes an indication<br>
that a sufficient number of the mobile stations are complaining regarding link quality. The<br>
steps of the mode of operation of the link quality monitoring procedure illustrated in Fig.<br>
3C are generally the same as those of the mode of Fig. 3 (and accordingly are similarly<br>
numbered), with the addition of step 3-10. Step 3-10 specifically involves the controller<br>
48 of the network node checking whether a prerequisite percentage of the mobile stations<br>
involved in the point-to-multipoint transmission on common downlink channel 32 are<br>
unhappy (e.g., are complaining by sending, e.g., a downswitch request). If it is determined<br>
at step 3-10 that a prerequisite percentage (or estimated prerequisite percentage) of the<br>
mobile stations involved in the point-to-multipoint transmission on common downlink<br>
channel 32 are unhappy, then step 3-11 is performed for using a more robust coding<br><br><br>
scheme. But if there are no unhappy mobile stations, or if the percentage of unhappy<br>
mobiles is less than a requisite trigger percentage, no change is made to the coding scheme<br>
(e.g., the transmission process of step 3-7 and the monitoring process of step 3-8 continue<br>
without coding scheme change). In such case, the network node 28 would deliberately<br>
determine that any unhappy but unsatisfied mobile stations would not receive enough<br>
information to be able to obtain the data (e.g., a video clip) with satisfactory sound and<br>
picture quality.<br>
Step 3-10 of the mode of Fig. 3C thus involves a determination by network node 28 of an<br>
estimated percentage of unhappy mobile stations. The network node 28 must first know<br>
the number of mobile stations participating in the point-to-multipoint transmission on<br>
common downlink channel 32 before it can determine the estimated percentage of<br>
unhappy mobile stations. As indicated previously, the network node 28 typically knows<br>
the number of mobile stations participating in the point-to-multipoint transmission by<br>
keeping track of the number of participating mobile stations at setup of the point-to-<br>
multipoint transmission. Alternatively, or additionally should the number of participating<br>
mobile stations change, the network node 28 can determine the number of mobile stations<br>
participating in the point-to-multipoint transmission by a post-setup polling procedure.<br>
Determining the estimated percentage of unhappy mobile stations also involves<br>
determining an estimate of the number of unhappy mobile stations. But, as mentioned<br>
above with reference to the format of a downswitch request burst 70, identities of the<br>
complaining mobile stations need not be provided in the downswitch request. Further,<br>
even if identifications of mobile stations are included in the downswitch request burst 70,<br>
more than one mobile station may transmit a burst 70 at a same or near same point in time.<br>
In such case, the network node 28 may not be able to decode the bursts. While it might be<br>
possible to decode the burst with the strongest power, other contemporaneously received<br>
burst could not be decoded. Nor would it be possible to ascertain how many bursts were<br>
transmitted at approximately the same time.<br>
Therefore, to estimate the percentage of unhappy mobile stations the network node 28<br>
should try to ensure that the random access bursts 70 are not transmitted at the same point<br>
in time, thus providing the network node 28 with some hope of counting the unhappy<br><br>
mobile stations. However, the network node 28 has no way of addressing the mobile<br>
stations individually, and hence cannot assign different points in time to different mobile<br>
stations.<br>
In view of the foregoing, one example technique of implementing the mode of Fig. 3C is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5. In the technique of Fig. 5, a specified number of plural time slots<br>
(e.g., time slots 72-1 through 72-10) received on the common uplink channel 36 are<br>
formed or associated together into a reporting group 80. When a mobile station 30<br>
determines that it needs to complain about link quality of the point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission, a signal (e.g., burst 70) indicative of the complaint is made in one of the<br>
plural time slots 72-1 through 72-10 forming reporting group 80. Preferably, the particular<br>
time slot in which the mobile station is permitted to send the signal indicative of the<br>
complaint is randomly determined. The controller 48 of the network node 28 then obtains<br>
an estimate of a number of the mobile stations that are complaining regarding link quality<br>
by ascertaining how many of the plural time slots 72 in the reporting group 80 include a<br>
signal indicative of a complaint. The controller 48 of the network node 28 compares the<br>
estimate to a predetermined trigger value, and (as step 3-11) changes the encoding of the<br>
point-to-multipoint transmission from the first coding scheme to the second coding<br>
scheme when the estimate equals or exceeds the predetermined trigger value (the second<br>
coding scheme being a more robust coding scheme than the first coding scheme).<br>
The technique of Fig. 5 thus involves the random selection of points in time (or timeslots,<br>
as the points in time are called). If there are only a few mobile stations but a large number<br>
of timeslots from which to make random selection, the likelihood that two mobile stations<br>
will select the same timeslot is rather small. In the illustrated example, up to ten different<br>
timeslots seem reasonable. By determining during how many of these ten timeslots there<br>
was a mobile transmitting a burst (e.g. during how many timeslots the network received<br>
any signal power), the network can estimate roughly how many terminals there are, at<br>
least if the number of terminals is less than ten. In the particular illustration of Fig. 5, time<br>
slots 72-2, 72-4, and 72-6 randomly carry bursts 70-2, 70-4, and 70-6, respectively,<br>
generated from three different mobile stations. Therefore, knowing the number of time<br>
slots and the total number of mobile stations involved in the point-to-multipoint<br>
transmission, the network node 28 can compute an estimated percentage (e.g., 3 time<br><br>
slots/8 mobiles = 37.5% unhappy mobiles). As part of step 3-10 of Fig. 3C, this<br>
percentage can be compared to a predetermined trigger percentage to ascertain whether the<br>
network node 28 should chose a more robust coding scheme.<br>
There also can be alternative ways of determining/detecting during how many of the ten<br>
timeslots there was a mobile transmitting a burst. The detection could be more<br>
sophisticated, such as (for example) searching for a training sequence, or decoding the<br>
payload part of the random access burst (the channel code may contain an error detection).<br>
If the network node 28 wants to estimate the number of terminals even in the case when<br>
there are significantly more than ten terminals, the network node 28 may request that the<br>
mobile stations send a random access (RA) burst only with a certain probability. If this<br>
probability is set to, e.g. 10%, and there are 50 terminals in total in the cell that are.<br>
interested in the point-to-multipoint transmission, then five mobiles will send RA bursts,<br>
which is a number low enough to be counted with the ten-timeslot strategy. The network<br>
node 28 does not necessarily a priori know what percentage to select, but by successively<br>
decreasing (or increasing) the percentage (10%, 1%, 0.1%...) and asking for renewed<br>
sending of RA bursts (during new ten-timeslot periods), the network node 28 will<br>
eventually receive only a few RA bursts during a ten-timeslot period, and hence have a<br>
rough estimate of the number of terminals.<br>
It will be appreciate that one or more of the above described modes of Fig. 3, Fig. 3 A, Fig.<br>
3B, and Fig. 3C, or variations thereof, may be combined. For example, Fig. 3D shows a<br>
combination of steps from the various modes.<br>
As mentioned above, the network node controller 48 of the network node 28 can choose<br>
from plural coding schemes for encoding the point-to-multipoint transmission carried on<br>
common downlink channel 32. As examples, coding parameters for the nine EGPRS<br>
coding schemes MSC-1 through MSC-9 are shown in the Table below.<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated that the network node 28 illustrated, e.g., in Fig. 1, may be<br>
connected to external core network nodes, such as (for example) a connectionless external<br>
core network. Such external network connections may be made through a Gateway<br>
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Support Node (GGSN) to a Serving General Packet<br>
Radio Service (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), the latter being tailored to provide packet-<br>
switched type services.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to<br>
be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is<br>
