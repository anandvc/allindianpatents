				<td>ABSTRACT ACCESS TO AUDIO OUTPUT VIA CAPTURE SERVICE An operating system has an audio system service that can capture all of the streaming audio destined for an output device and make it available for processing. An application can perform the processing upon the captured streaming audio. Any streaming audio that is output by the application and destined for a render device can also be captured for signal processing prior to being mixed with other streaming audio destined for the output device.
