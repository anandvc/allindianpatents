BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the field of data communication for wireless networks, TCP is used as a connection<br>
oriented protocol that fragments and reassembles a byte stream into discrete messages or<br>
packets. Furthermore, IP-protocols are used in the next lower layer for delivering IP-<br>
packets, e.g. by packet routing.<br>
The TCP service is obtained by having both a host (hereinafter also called SERVER) and a<br>
client (hereinafter also called mobile station or MS) create end points called sockets. Each<br>
socket has a number (address) comprising an IP address of the host and a 16-bit number<br>
local to that host, called a port.<br><br>
To obtain TCP service a connection must be established between a socket on the<br>
SERVER, and a socket on the MS. A socket may be used for multiple connections at the<br>
same time. Every byte on a TCP connection has its own 32-bit sequence number used both<br>
for acknowledgements and for a window mechanism, which use a separate 32-bit header<br>
field.<br>
The sending and receiving TCP entities exchange data in the form of segments. A segment<br>
consists of a fixed 20-byte header (plus an optional part) followed by zero or more data<br>
bytes. The TCP software decides how the segments should be. It can accumulate data from<br>
several writes into one segment or split data from one write over multiple segments. Two<br>
limits restrict the segment size. Firstly, each segment, including the TCP header, must fit<br>
in the 65,535 byte IP payload. Secondly, each network has a maximum transfer unit<br>
(MTU), and each segment must fit in the MTU.<br>
The MTU, is the largest physical packet size, measured in bytes (B), that a network can<br>
transmit. Any messages larger than the MTU are divided into smaller packets before being<br>
sent.<br>
Every network has a different MTU, which is set by the network administrator. For<br>
example, on Windows 95, a user can also set the MTU of his machine. This defines the<br>
maximum size of the packets sent from that computer onto the network. Ideally, it is<br>
desired that the MTU is the same as the smallest MTU of all the networks between a<br>
certain machine and a message's final destination. In practice, the MTU is generally a few<br>
thousand bytes and thus defines the upper bound on segment size. If a segment passes<br>
through a sequence of networks without being fragmented and then hits a network whose<br>
MTU is smaller than the segment, the router at the boundary fragments the segment into<br>
two or more smaller segments, which slows down transmission speeds.<br>
In the field of wireless communication there is a certain router in the interface (Gb or Iu)<br>
between a land line bound network and the wireless network, The wireless network may<br>
comprise MS:s in the form of mobile telephones for mobile telephone services, or mobile<br>
telephones or computers for data communication. The wireless network may be in the<br><br>
form of the so called 2G or 2.5G standard (the Gb interface) for the use of, for example,<br>
GSM or EDGE. The wireless network may also be in the form of the so called 3G<br>
standard (the Iu interface) for the use of, for example, WCDMA. The router breaks down<br>
the data stream from the land line network into smaller segments according to the given<br>
standard. In the present GPRS standard the router is labelled SGSN, which is a node in a<br>
GPRS infrastructure that is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the<br>
mobile stations within its service area. Its tasks include packet routing and transfer,<br>
mobility management (attach/detach and location management), logical link management,<br>
and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores<br>
location information and user profiles of all GPRS users registered with this SGSN as of<br>
June 2001.<br>
A segment that is too large for a network is broken up by the router into multiple<br>
segments. Each new segment gets its own IP header, so fragmentation by routers increases<br>
the total overhead because each additional segment adds 20 bytes of extra header<br>
information in the form of an IP header.<br>
Each host is allowed to specify the maximum TCP payload it is willing to accept, but all<br>
Internet hosts are required to accept TCP segments of 536+20 bytes (536 bytes of TCP<br>
payload and 20 bytes TCP header + 20 B of IP header ending up at an MTU of 576B).<br>
During setup of the TCP connection, each side can announce its maximum segment size<br>
(MSS) and can also see the suggested MSS from the counterpart. According to the present<br>
TCP/IP standard, the minimum MTU that can be sent without risking fragmentation or<br>
MTU Discovery is 576B in a correctly configured network.<br>
A problem with prior art occurs when the SGSN is forced to fragment the IP segment(s)<br>
from the land line network into segments of lesser size in order to satisfy the demands<br>
from the wireless network. The lesser sized segments are not optimised by forehand, but<br>
serves only to fit the standard of the MS. As a consequence the last of the lesser sized<br>
segments may comprise only a small amount of information instead of a complete<br>
utilisation of the segment. By not utilising the complete segment for the transport of<br>
information, the overall performance of the system is not optimal.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a need for an improved handling when setting up a connection between<br>
a host and a client using a connection oriented protocol in a system comprising a wireless<br>
network.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to meet the above stated need with a method for optimising<br>
the data communication in a network comprising a wireless radio network using a<br>
connection oriented protocol over an internet protocol IP. The connection oriented<br>
protocol may advantageously be TCP, but may be a different connection oriented protocol<br>
in another standard. The method comprises:<br>
-	establishing a communication between a host and a client with a connection oriented<br>
protocol over the internet protocol by;<br>
-	the client sending information to the host what maximum segment size MSS the client<br>
can handle;	.	- .<br>
-	the host sending a response to the client what maximum segment size MSS the host can<br>
handle;<br>
or by;<br>
-	the host sending information to the client what maximum segment size the host can<br>
handle;<br>
-	the client sending a response to the host what maximum segment size the client can<br>
handle;<br><br>
- letting a router intervening the response from the host or the client, and changing the<br>
maximum segment size into a maximum segment size based on the router's knowledge<br>
about the radio network.<br>
In the previously known systems using connection oriented protocols over IP, the router is<br>
transparent to the negotiation between the client and the host. However, the router<br>
negotiates with the client and/or the host regarding the performance of the radio network.<br>
The router therefore has knowledge about the wireless radio network, i.e. radio parameters<br>
in the wireless system such as capacity etc. One benefit of the invention is that the router<br>
intervenes the negotiation and alters or adds (if an MSS value is lacking) the MSS value<br>
taking the parameters from the wireless network into account. This gives that the host and<br>
the client can be made sending packets (in both directions) that are smaller or larger than<br>
what was announced by the end points during the setup phase, thereby enabling a better<br>
utilisation of the system by always using optimum fragmentation and thus optimizing the<br>
connection oriented protocol payload packet sizes. The method thus gives a better<br>
utilisation and performance of the wireless system.<br>
It should also be mentioned that a segment can be a non-fragment segment, i.e. a segment<br>
not allowed to be segmented. When a non-fragment segment is too large it is deleted,<br>
instead of fragmented, and an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) message is sent<br>
to the sending unit that the segment was too large. This is normally called path MTU<br>
discovery. The present invention gives a benefit also for transmission of non-fragment<br>
segment by the non-fragment segment being optimal in size from the beginning and the<br>
path MTU discovery does not need to be brought into action.<br>
Another advantage is that the standard used need not be altered, but by programming the<br>
router to intervene, the host and the client can be left unaltered and work according to the<br>
previous standard.<br>
Yet one advantage with the invention is thus that the router dynamically calculates the<br>
optimum maximum segment size MSS for every new session that is established. The<br>
router negotiates with a client or a host in the wireless network, for example regarding<br><br>
LLC, SDU, etc., and thus collects information about the wireless network. Dynamically<br>
refers to the router using the information on calculating optimum maximum segment size<br>
MSS every time a connection oriented communication is established between a host and a<br>
client.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the connection oriented protocol is a transmission<br>
control protocol TCP.<br>
The invention thus refers to a method acting when a PDP context is negotiated for an MS<br>
in the SGSN, where parameters regarding QoS and link layer configuration are negotiated.<br>
These values can be used to optimize the TCP packet sizes for negotiate PDP context. This<br>
is done by intervening TCP synchronization packets that are used to negotiate the MSS for<br>
TCP and change the values for the MSS based on the parameters.<br>
Below follows a number of examples of parameters that can be used in a router such as a<br>
GPRS SGSN, as a basis for a decision for altering the MSS.<br>
-	One example of usage is that the GTPvO and GTPvl payload tunnel headers have<br>
different sizes. The former is normally 40B long and the latter is normally 48B long.<br>
Depending on which one of these protocols that is used for tunnelling payload to the<br>
GGSN, different TCP packet sizes are optimal to use over the Gn interface.<br>
-	IP fragmentation on the lu interface. The IP fragmentation for the GTPvl protocol is<br>
always used for payload traffic.<br>
-	The SGSN to MS negotiated LLC SDU (payload data) size. The LLC SDU size is<br>
normally negotiated to 500B, which with the SNDCP overhead means that 1500B end-<br>
user packet needs for LLC frames where the last one is 12B. If the TCP packet size is<br>
decreased to 1488B the radio interface efficiency is increased in a GSM/GPRS based<br>
system where the SNDCP is placed in the SGSN. However, in a UMTS/GPRS based<br>
system this is not true since the SNDCP is in the RNC for 3GPP based systems.<br><br>
- Gb interface protocol. Frame relay can handle packets up to 1600, but when Gb-over-IP<br>
is introduced the MTU size on the Gb interface may enforce fragmentation depending on<br>
the negotiated LLC SDU size, which has a maximum value of 1520B, but with additional<br>
headers to be added. Efficiency for the Gb interface would increase if fragmentation is<br>
avoided when possible. Calculations indicate that end-user packets shall not exceed 1423B<br>
to avoid fragmentation if the LLC SDU is negotiated larger than 1427B.<br>
All the relevant parameters need to be considered for optimal result, but even taking one<br>
or some of the parameters into consideration will give a better utilisation of the system.<br>
GPRS is a packet solution for wireless data used in, for example, GSM-based packet<br>
switching specification by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)<br>
and 3G specification by the International Telecommunication ITU for wireless data. In<br>
GSM for example, data rates are promised from 56 up to 114 Kbps and continuous<br>
connection to the Internet for mobile phone and computer users. The higher data rates will<br>
allow users to take part in video conferences and interact with multimedia Web sites and<br>
similar applications using mobile handheld devices as well as notebook computers. GPRS<br>
will complement existing services such as circuit-switched cellular phone connections and<br>
the Short Message Service (SMS) as of July 2000.<br>
When setting up the TCP connection the client sends a SYN (synchronising) segment<br>
comprising a flag and information to the host what MSS the client is willing to accept.<br>
When the host has received the information it sends a reply comprising SYN<br>
acknowledgement and information what MSS the host is willing to accept. This<br>
negotiation is transparent to the SGSN, but the Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol ads<br>
an LLC header containing checksum and further segmentation<br>
In one embodiment, the network comprises a landline based network and the host is<br>
comprised in the land line based network and may be in the form of a SERVER, or a user<br>
PC (personal computer), or the like. The client is here comprised in the radio network and<br>
may be in the form of a mobile station such as a mobile telephone, a PC, or the like.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the method handles the intervention in the response<br>
in a logical link control protocol in the router.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the router is part of a radio link. This may be the<br>
situation when, for example, both the host and the client are mobile stations in a wireless<br>
local area network WLAN. Both mobile stations have wireless connection with the router<br>
and the router is aware of the radio network capacity. When the mobile stations then<br>
negotiates MSS, the router intervenes the synchronisation response and transmits an MSS<br>
according to the radio network parameters.<br>
In one embodiment, the mobile station is a GSM based equipment or an EDGE based<br>
equipment.<br>
In another embodiment, the mobile station is a WCDMA based equipment.<br>
The invention also refers to a telephone system and a router arranged to carry out the<br>
intervention according to the above described method.<br>

EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a TCP/IP based network in a GPRS standard according to<br>
prior art. The network comprises a landline based network and a first and a second<br>
wireless radio network. The land line based network comprises a host in the form of a<br>
SERVER and a GGSN and a SGSN. The first radio network comprises a BSC, a BTS and<br>
a client in the form of a MS, all based on GSM or EDGE, see also figure 4. The second<br>
radio network comprises an RNC, a Node B and a client in the form of an MS, all based<br>
on WCDMA, see also figure 5. The interface between the GGSN and the SGSN is called<br>
Gn, and the interface between the SGSN and the BSC is called Gb, and the interface<br>
between the SGSN and the RNC is called lu. The interface between the MS and the BTS<br>
in the first radio network is called Um and the interface between the MS and the Node-B in<br>
the second radio network is called Uv. The interface between the GGSN and the SERVER<br>
is called Gi..	.<br>
When discussing figure 1, cross-references are made to figures 4 and 5. Figure 4<br>
schematically shows different stacked protocols of the GGSN over the Gn interface to the<br>
SGSN and the SGSN over the Gb interface to the MS. Figure 5 schematically shows<br>
different stacked protocols of the GGSN over the Gn interface to the SGSN and the SGSN<br>
over the Iu interface to the MS.<br>
The GGSN refers to a gateway GPRS support node acting as an interface between the<br>
GPRS backbone network and the external packet data networks (radio network and the IP<br>
network). It converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the appropriate<br>
packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g. IP) and sends them out on the corresponding<br>
packet data network. In the other direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are<br>
converted to the GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to<br>
the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the<br><br>
user and his or her profile in its location register. The GGSN also performs authentication<br>
and charging functions towards external systems, whereas SGSN performs GSM<br>
authentication.<br>
The function of the SGSN is as a router in the interface between the wireless network and<br>
the land line based network and has been explained above.<br>
WCDMA technology is used for UTRAN air interface. UMTS WCDMA is a Direct<br>
Sequence CDMA system where user data is multiplied with quasi-random bits derived<br>
from WCDMA Spreading codes. In UMTS, in addition to channelisation, Codes are used<br>
for synchronisation and scrambling. WCDMA has two basic modes of operation:<br>
Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD).<br>
The functions of the Node-B are:<br>
•	Air interface Transmission / Reception •	Modulation / Demodulation<br>
•	CDMA Physical Channel coding<br>
•	Micro Diversity<br>
•	Error Handing<br>
•	Closed loop power control<br>
The functions of the RNC are:<br>
•	Radio Resource Control<br>
•	Admission Control<br>
•	Channel Allocation<br>
•	Power Control Settings<br>
•	Handover Control<br>
•	Macro Diversity<br>
•	Ciphering<br>
•	Segmentation / Reassembly<br>
•	Broadcast Signalling<br><br>
• Open Loop Power Control<br>
EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution) is a 3G technology that delivers<br>
broadband-like data speeds to mobile devices. It allows consumers to connect to the<br>
Internet and send and receive data, including digital images, web pages and photographs,<br>
three times faster than possible with an ordinary GSM/GPRS network.<br>
The invention refers essentially to the, so called, general packet radio system (GPRS). The<br>
GPRS of today has an MTU of 1500B (1500 Bytes). The GPRS is implemented as a<br>
virtual link between the MS and the GGSN with 1500 MTU at both ends. Between the<br>
SGSN the link is realised as a tunnel over a GTP protocol that adds 40B-48B depending<br>
on GTP version. GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the protocol used between SGSN and<br>
GGSN to tunnel various data protocols through the GPRS backbone. In addition to<br>
supporting GTPvO for 2.5G (GPRS), this feature allows the GGSN to be UMTS R99<br>
compliant with respect to the GTP protocol (called GTPvl per the 3 GPP R99/UMTS<br>
standards specification).<br>
Over the Gb interface in GSM GPRS the virtual link is fragmented into different link<br>
protocols such as LLC. The IP frames are fragmented over this frame format and not on<br>
the IP level, but oh the SNDCP protocol level. However, the LLC protocol is fragmented<br>
over the RLC without SGSN being aware, but the SGSN trusts that it is being done. These<br>
stacked protocols have frame sizes not aligned for optimal performance and bandwidth<br>
utilization.<br>
The radio interfaces lu in the RNC for UMTS GPRS has the same problem as the Gb<br>
interface in GSM GPRS, but here the protocol layers are partly different and protocol<br>
layers that are similar between the two standards are differently distributed.<br>
Concentration is performed in the air interface lu, because the number of traffic channels<br>
is limited. The BSC connects traffic channels between the BTS and the SGSN, employing<br>
a pool of voice coders that can be connected to the switch in the BSC. The BSC also<br><br>
performs the required switching during a call in progress, as the mobile moves from one<br>
cell to another within a BSC service area.<br>
As mentioned above describing prior art, one problem with the existing MSS modification<br>
is that the radio interfaces Gb and lu are not utilized in an optimal way. Large packets over<br>
the GTP tunnels can make the GFTP packets exceed 1500B, which often must be<br>
fragmented in the IP network. This is costly for the system and should be avoided.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows prior art TCP/IP connection setup between the SERVER<br>
and the MS over the SGSNin the first wireless radio network. When setting up the TCP<br>
connection the MS sends information to the SERVER comprising a sychronising SYN,ue<br>
segment comprising a flag and information to the SERVER what MSS the MS is willing<br>
to accept. The SERVER sends a response in the form of a SYN,serv (synchronising)<br>
segment comprising a flag and information to the MS what MSS the SERVER is willing to accept. Typically the SERVER suggests an MSS of 1500 B and the MS suggests an<br>
MSS of 500B. However, the SGSN is not part of the negotiation between the SERVER<br>
and the MS, but the SGSN only passes the information on until a TCP/IP connection has<br>
been established. Furthermore, the SGSN handles the breaking down of segments that are<br>
too large for the radio network too handle. This has been discussed above as the problem<br>
with the present method.<br>
In figure 2 the SGSN also negotiates NEG with the MS regarding radio network<br>
parameters, for example, information regarding the capacity of the radio network. This<br>
negotiation NEG is handled by a LLC protocol in both the MS and the SGSN.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows the inventive TCP/IP connection setup between the<br>
SERVER and the MS over the SGSN. In figure 3 the SGSN negotiates NEG with the MS.<br>
This negotiation NEG gives the SGSN information on the capacity of the radio network.<br>
The MS sends information to the SERVER comprising a sychronising SYN,ue segment<br>
comprising a flag and information to the SERVER what MSS the MS is willing to accept.<br>
Typically the MS suggest an MSS of 500B. The SERVER sends a response in the form of<br>
a SYN,serv (synchronising) segment comprising a flag and information to the MS what<br><br>
MSS the SERVER is willing to accept. Typically the SERVER suggests an MSS of 1500<br>
B. According to the invention the SGSN uses its information on the radio network<br>
capacity and interrupts the answer from the SERVER during the setup phase and instead<br>
sends a SYN,sgsn to the MS giving an MSS based on the wireless network parameters.<br>
The MS is not aware that the SGSN has intervened, but believes that the suggested MSS is<br>
a proper suggestion from the SERVER. The SGSN decides the MSS in view of the<br>
knowledge about the wireless network such that the fragmentation of the data stream<br>
becomes optimal, i.e. such that the SGSN does not have to break up the segments. The<br>
segments will thus be used to its maximum.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the above embodiment, but may be varied within the<br>
scope of the appending claims. For example, the BSC may, based on the parameters<br>
owned by the BSC, change the MSS value that is announced by the endpoints (SERVER<br>
and MS ) in the setup phase of a TCP session.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD FOR MODIFYING MSS<br>
The invention refers to a method for optimising the data communication in a network<br>
comprising a wireless radio network using connection oriented protocol (TCP) over<br>
internet protocol (IP). The network comprises a router (SGSN) intervening the connection<br>
oriented setup between a host (SERVER) and a client (MS), and changing the maximum<br>
segment size (MSS, ms) into a maximum segment size (MSS, sgsn) based on the router's<br>
(SGSN) knowledge about the radio network.<br>
