[001] This application claims priority to United States provisional<br>
Ser. No. 60/419,964, filed October 22, 2002, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The technical field relates to antibodies against growth and<br>
differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), in particular human antibodies, and antibody<br>
fragments, especially those that inhibit GDF-8 activity in vitro and/or in vivo.<br>
The field further relates to diagnosing, preventing, or treating degenerative<br>
disorders of muscle or bone, or disorders of insulin metabolism.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Growth and differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), also known as<br>
myostatin, is a secreted protein and is a member of the transforming growth<br>
factor-beta (TGF-B) superfamily of structurally related growth factors, all of<br>
which possess physiologically important growth-regulatory and morphogenetic<br>
properties (Kingsley et al. (1994) Genes Dev., 8: 133-146; Hoodless et al.<br>
(1998) Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol., 228: 235-272). Similarly to TGF-B,<br>
human GDF-8 is synthesized as a 375 amino acid long precursor protein.<br>
The precursor GDF-8 protein forms a homodimer. During processing the<br>
amino-terminal propeptide is cleaved off at Arg-266. The cleaved propeptide,<br>
known as the "latency-associated peptide" (LAP), may remain noncovalently<br>
bound to the homodimer, thereby inactivating the complex (Miyazono et al.<br><br>
(1988) J. Biol. Chem., 263: 6407-6415; Wakefield et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
263: 7646-7654; Brown et al. (1990) Growth Factors, 3: 35-43; and Thies et<br>
al. (2001) Growth Factors, 18: 251-259). The complex of mature GDF-8 with<br>
propeptide is commonly referred to as the "small latent complex" (Gentry et al.<br>
(1990) Biochemistry, 29: 6851-6857; Derynck et al. (1995) Nature, 316:<br>
701-705; and Massague (1990) Ann. Rev. Cell Biol., 12: 597-641). Other<br>
proteins are also known to bind to mature GDF-8 and inhibit its biological<br>
activity. Such inhibitory proteins include follistatin and follistatin-related<br>
proteins (Gamer et al. (1999) Dev. Biol., 208: 222-232).<br>
[0004] An alignment of deduced amino acid sequences from various<br>
species demonstrates that GDF-8 is highly conserved throughout evolution<br>
(McPherron et al. (1997) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94:12457-12461). In<br>
fact, the sequences of human, mouse, rat, porcine, and chicken GDF-8 are<br>
100% identical in the C-terminal region, while in baboon, bovine, and ovine<br>
they differ only by 3 amino acids. The zebrafish GDF-8 is the most diverged;<br>
however, it is still 88% identical to human.<br>
[0005] The high degree of conservation suggests that GDF-8 has<br>
an essential function. GDF-8 is highly expressed in the developing and adult<br>
skeletal muscle and was found to be involved in the regulation of critical<br>
biological processes in the muscle and in osteogenesis. For example, GDF-8<br>
knockout transgenic mice are characterized by a marked hypertrophy and<br>
hyperplasia of the skeletal muscle (McPherron et al. (1997) Nature, 387:<br>
83-90) and altered cortical bone structure (Hamrick et al. (2000) Bone, 27 (3):<br>
343-349). Similar increases in skeletal muscle mass are evident in naturally<br><br>
occurring mutations of GDF-8 in cattle (Ashmore et al. (1974) Growth, 38:<br>
501-507; Swatland et al. (1994) J. Anim. Sci., 38: 752-757; McPherron et al.<br>
(1997) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94:12457-12461; and Kambadur et al.<br>
(1997) Genome Res., 7: 910-915). Studies have indicated that muscle<br>
wasting associated with HIV-infection is accompanied by an increase in<br>
GDF-8 expression (Gonzalez-Cadavid et al. (1998) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.<br>
U.S.A., 95:14938-14943). GDF-8 has also been implicated in the production<br>
of muscle-specific enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase) and proliferation of<br>
myoblast cells (WO 00/43781). In addition to its growth-regulatory and<br>
morphogenetic properties, GDF-8 is thought to be also involved in a number<br>
of other physiological processes, including glucose homeostasis in the<br>
development of type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, metabolic<br>
syndromes (e.g., syndrome X), insulin resistance induced by trauma, such as<br>
burns or nitrogen imbalance, and adipose tissue disorders (e.g., obesity) <kim></kim>
et al. (2001) BBRC, 281: 902-906).<br>
[0006] A number of human and animal disorders are associated<br>
with functionally impaired muscle tissue, e.g., muscular dystrophy (including<br>
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscle<br>
atrophy, organ atrophy, frailty, congestive obstructive pulmonary disease,<br>
sarcopenia, cachexia, and muscle wasting syndromes caused by other<br>
diseases and conditions. To date, very few reliable or effective therapies<br>
have been developed to treat these disorders.<br>
[0007] There are also a number of conditions associated with a<br>
loss of bone, which include osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, especially in the<br><br>
elderly and/or postmenopausal women. In addition, metabolic bone diseases<br>
and disorders include low bone mass due to chronic glucocorticoid therapy,<br>
premature gonadal failure, androgen suppression, vitamin D deficiency,<br>
secondary hyperparathyroidism, nutritional deficiencies, and anorexia<br>
nervosa. Currently available therapies for these conditions work by inhibiting<br>
bone resorption. A therapy that promotes new bone formation would be a<br>
desirable alternative to these therapies.<br>
[0^08] Thus, a need exists to develop new therapies that contribute<br>
to an overall increase of muscle mass and/or strength and/or bone density,<br>
especially, in humans.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide<br>
safe and effective therapeutic methods for muscle and/or bone-associated<br>
disorders.<br>
[0010] It is another object of the invention to provide methods of<br>
increasing muscle mass and/or bone strength and/or density in vertebrates.<br>
[0011] It is yet another object of the invention to provide inhibitors of<br>
GDF-8 that are safe and effective in vivo.<br>
[0012] Still another object of the invention is to provide human<br>
antibodies and fragments thereof that bind GDF-8 with high specificity and<br>
affinity.<br>
[0013] Thus, methods for treating muscle and bone degenerative<br>
disorders are provided. The methods are also useful for increasing muscle<br>
mass and bone density in normal animals. Also provided are novel human<br><br>
anti-GDF-8 antibodies, termed Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22, and antibodies<br>
and antigen-binding fragments derived therefrom. The antibodies of the<br>
invention possess a number of useful properties. First, the antibodies are<br>
capable of binding mature GDF-8 with high affinity. Second, the disclosed<br>
antibodies inhibit GDF-8 activity in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated, for<br>
example, by inhibition of ActRIIB binding and reporter gene assays. Third, the<br>
disclosed antibodies may inhibit GDF-8 activity associated with negative<br>
regulation of skeletal muscle mass and bone density.<br>
[0014] Certain embodiments of the invention comprise the Vh and/or<br>
VL domain of the Fv fragment of Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22. Further<br>
embodiments comprise one or more complementarity determining regions<br>
(CDRs) of any of these VH and Vl domains. Other embodiments comprise an<br>
H3 fragment of the VH domain of Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22.<br>
[0015] Other aspects provide compositions containing antibodies of<br>
the invention or their antigen-binding fragments, and their use in methods of<br>
inhibiting or neutralizing GDF-8, including methods of treatment of the human<br>
or animals. The antibodies of the invention may be used to treat or prevent<br>
conditions in which an increase in muscle tissue or bone density is desirable.<br>
For example, the presently disclosed antibodies may be used in therapies to<br>
repair damaged muscle, e.g., myocardium, diaphragm, etc. Exemplary<br>
disease and disorders include muscle and neuromuscular disorders such as<br>
muscular dystrophy (including Duchenne's muscular dystrophy); amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis; muscle atrophy; organ atrophy; frailty; tunnel syndrome;<br>
congestive obstructive pulmonary disease; sarcopenia, cachexia, and other<br><br>
muscle wasting syndromes; adipose tissue disorders (e.g., obesity); type 2<br>
diabetes; impaired glucose tolerance; metabolic syndromes {e.g., syndrome<br>
X); insulin resistance induced by trauma such as burns or nitrogen imbalance;<br>
and bone degenerative diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis and osteoporosis).<br>
[0016] In addition, the presently disclosed antibodies may be used<br>
as a diagnostic tool to quantitatively or qualitatively detect GDF-8 or its<br>
fragments in a biological sample. The presence or amount of GDF-8 detected<br>
can be correlated with one or more of the medical conditions listed above.<br>
[0017] Another aspect provides an isolated nucleic acid, which<br>
comprises a sequence encoding a VHor VL domain from an Fv fragment of<br>
Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22. An isolated nucleic acid, which comprises a<br>
sequence encoding at least one CDR from any of the presently disclosed Vh<br>
and VL domains, is also disclosed. Another aspect provides host cells<br>
comprising such nucleic acid.<br>
[0018] Yet another aspect provides a method of producing new VH<br>
and VL domains and/or functional antibodies comprising all or a portion of<br>
such domains derived from the VH or VL domains of Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22.<br>
[0019] Additional objects of the invention will be set forth in part in<br>
the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description,<br>
or may be learned by practice of the invention. Various objects, aspects, and<br>
advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the<br>
elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
[0020] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general<br>
description and the following detailed description are exemplary and<br>
explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
[0021] Figure 1 shows that biotinylated GDF-8 and BMP-11 bind the<br>
ActRIIB receptor with an ED5o of 15 ng/ml and 40 ng/ml, respectively.<br>
[0022] Figure 2 shows inhibition of GDF-8 binding to the ActRIIB<br>
receptor by scFv fragments of the invention. As illustrated, the IC50 for scFv's<br>
of Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22 are 2.4 nM, 1.7 nM, and 60 nM, respectively.<br>
[0023] Figures 3A and 3B show that preincubation of Myo29 with<br>
biotinylated GDF-8 or BMP-11 at 10 ng/ml inhibits GDF-8 or BMP-11 binding<br>
to ActRIIB in the ActRIIB binding assay with an IC50 of 0.2-0.4 nM.<br>
[0024] Figures 4B and 4C depict results of pGL3(CAGA)i2 reporter<br>
gene assays, in which Myo29 was tested. Figure 4A demonstrates the<br>
baseline conditions, i.e., induction of the reporter gene activity by GDF-8,<br>
BMP-11, and activin. Figures 4B and 4C show that Myo29 reduces the<br>
GDF-8 activity in a dose-responsive manner, with an IC50 of 15-30 ng/ml, and<br>
inhibits the biological activity of BMP-11 to the same extent. Figure 4D<br>
illustrates that Myo29 does not affect the activity of activin in this assay.<br>
[0025] Figure 5 shows results of epitope mapping for Myo22,<br>
Myo28, and Myo29. The epitope for Myo29 was mapped from amino acid 72<br>
to amino acid 88 of mature GDF-8; for Myo22, from amino acid 1 to amino<br>
acid 44; for Myo28, from amino acids 1 to amino acid 98.<br>
[0026] Figure 6 demonstrates results of a substitution analysis of<br>
the Myo29 epitope. Residues Lys-78, Pro-81, and Asn-83 in mature GDF-8<br>
appear to be important for Myo29 binding to GDF-8.<br>
[0027] Figure 7 depicts results of an immunoprecipitation<br>
experiment performed with Myo29 and Myo28. Conditioned medium from<br>
CHO cells expressing GDF-8, which were radiolabeled with<br>
35S-methionine/cysteine, was subjected to immunoprecipitation with Myo29 or<br>
Myo28. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under<br>
reducing conditions. Bands on the gel are identified as mature GDF-8, GDF-8<br>
propeptide, and unprocessed GDF-8.<br>
[0028] Figure 8 depicts results of a pharmacokinetic study in which<br>
C57B6/SCID mice received a dose of 1 mg/kg as a single intravenous (IV) or<br>
intraperitoneal (IP) administration of Myo29. Myo29 shows prolonged<br>
terminal half-life of around one week and low clearance around 1 ml/hr/kg.<br>
The fraction absorbed following IP injection is about 77%.<br>
[0029] Figure 9 shows comparisons of quadriceps mass in male<br>
C57B6/SCID mice treated weekly with various doses of Myo29 (60, 10, and 1<br>
mg/kg), or vehicle (PBS). Treatment with Myo29, at the 10 and 60 mg/kg<br>
dose levels for four weeks results in a statistically significant increase in<br>
muscle mass of 19% and 23%, respectively.<br>
[0030] Figure 10A and 10B show gastrocnemius and quadriceps<br>
mass in female CB17 SCID mice treated weekly with various doses of Myo29<br>
(10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mg/kg) or PBS for four weeks. Muscle mass is increased by<br>
10 to 20% in mice treated with Myo29 as compared to the vehicle control.<br><br>
[0031] Figure 11A and 11B demonstrate respectively gastrocnemius<br>
and quadriceps muscle mass in female CB17 SCID mice treated weekly with<br>
various doses of Myo29 (10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mg/kg) or PBS for twelve weeks.<br>
Mice treated with Myo29 show increases in muscle mass ranging from 12 to<br>
28%.<br>
[0032] Figure 12 shows the front limb muscle strength, as measured<br>
by a grip strength meter, in female CB17 SCID mice treated weekly with<br>
Myo29 (10 and 5 mg/kg) or PBS for twelve weeks. Front limb strength is<br>
increased by 17% and 23% in mice treated with Myo29 at 5 mg/kg and 10<br>
mg/kg, respectively.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
I. Definitions<br>
[0033] The term "antibody," as used herein, refers to an<br>
immunoglobulin or a part thereof, and encompasses any polypeptide<br>
comprising an antigen-binding site regardless of the source, species of origin,<br>
method of production, and characteristics. As a non-limiting example, the<br>
term "antibody" includes human, orangutan, mouse, rat, goat, sheep, and<br>
chicken antibodies. The term includes but is not limited to polyclonal,<br>
monoclonal, monospecific, polyspecific, non-specific, humanized,<br>
single-chain, chimeric, synthetic, recombinant, hybrid, mutated, and<br>
CDR-grafted antibodies. For the purposes of the present invention, it also<br>
includes, unless otherwise stated, antibody fragments such as Fab, F(ab')2,<br>
Fv, scFv, Fd, dAb, and other antibody fragments that retain the<br>
antigen-binding function.<br>
[0034] Antibodies can be made, for example, via traditional<br>
hybridoma techniques (Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature, 256: 495-499),<br>
recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567), or phage display<br>
techniques using antibody libraries (Clackson et al. (1991) Nature, 352:<br>
624-628; Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597). For various other<br>
antibody production techniques, see Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, eds.<br>
Harlow et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988.<br>
[0035] The term "antigen-binding domain" refers to the part of an<br>
antibody molecule that comprises the area specifically binding to or<br>
complementary to a part or all of an antigen. Where an antigen is large, an<br>
antibody may only bind to a particular part of the antigen. The "epitope" or<br>
"antigenic determinant" is a portion of an antigen molecule that is responsible<br>
for specific interactions with the antigen-binding domain of an antibody. An<br>
antigen-binding domain may be provided by one or more antibody variable<br>
domains (e.g., a so-called Fd antibody fragment consisting of a Vh domain).<br>
An antigen-binding domain comprises an antibody light chain variable region<br>
(VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (Vh).<br>
[0036] The term "repertoire" refers to a genetically diverse collection<br>
of nucleotides, e.g., DNA, sequences derived wholly or partially from<br>
sequences which encode expressed immunoglobulins. The sequences are<br>
generated by in vivo rearrangement of, e.g., V, D, and J segments for H<br>
chains and, e.g., V and J segment for L chains. Alternatively, the sequences<br><br>
may be generated from a cell line by in vitro stimulation and in response to<br>
which rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, part or all of the sequences may<br>
be obtained by combining, e.g., unrearranged V segments with D and J<br>
segments, by nucleotide synthesis, randomised mutagenesis, and other<br>
methods as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332.<br>
[0037] The term "specific interaction," or "specifically binds," or the<br>
like, means that two molecules form a complex that is relatively stable under<br>
physiologic conditions. The term is also applicable where, e.g., an<br>
antigen-binding domain is specific for a particular epitope, which is carried by<br>
a number of antigens, in which case the antibody carrying the antigen-binding<br>
domain will be able to bind to the various antigens carrying the epitope. Thus,<br>
an antibody may specifically bind, for example, BMP-11 and GDF-8 as long<br>
as it binds to the epitope, which is carried by both.<br>
[0038] Specific binding is characterized by a high affinity and a low<br>
to moderate capacity. Nonspecific binding usually has a low affinity with a<br>
moderate to high capacity. Typically, the binding is considered specific when<br>
the affinity constant Ka is higher than 106 M-1 or preferably higher than 108<br>
M-1. If necessary, non-specific binding can be reduced without substantially<br>
affecting specific binding by varying the binding conditions. Such conditions<br>
are known in the art, and a skilled artisan using routine techniques can select<br>
appropriate conditions. The conditions are usually defined in terms of<br>
concentration of antibodies, ionic strength of the solution, temperature, time<br>
allowed for binding, concentration of non-related molecules (e.g., serum<br>
albumin, milk casein), etc. Exemplary conditions are set forth in Examples 4,<br>
7, and 10.<br>
[0039] The phrase "substantially as set out" means that the relevant<br>
CDR, VH, or VL domain will be either identical or highly similar to the specified<br>
regions of which the sequence is set out herein. For example, such<br>
substitutions include 1 or 2 out of any 5 amino acids in the sequence of a<br>
CDR (H1, H2, H3, L1, L2, or L3).<br>
[0040] The term "TGF-p superfamily" refers to a family of<br>
structurally-related growth factors. This family of related growth factors is well<br>
known in the art (Kingsley et al. (1994) Genes Dev., 8:133-146; Hoodless et<br>
al. (1998) Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol., 228: 235-72). The TGF-p<br>
superfamily includes bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), activin, inhibin,<br>
mullerian inhibiting substance, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and a still<br>
growing number of growth and differentiation factors (GDF), such as GDF-8<br>
(myostatin). Many of such proteins are structurally and/or functionally related<br>
to GDF-8. For example, human BMP-11, also known as GDF-11, is 90%<br>
identical to GDF-8 at the amino-acid level (Gamer et al. (1999) Dev. Biol. 208,<br>
222-232; Nakshima et al. (1999) Mech. Dev., 80:185-189).<br>
[0041] The term "GDF-8" refers to a specific growth and<br>
differentiation factor-8 and, where appropriate, factors that are structurally or<br>
functionally related to GDF-8, for example, BMP-11 and other factors<br>
belonging to the TGF-P superfamily. The term refers to the full-length<br>
unprocessed precursor form of GDF-8 as well as the mature and propeptide<br>
forms resulting from post-translational cleavage. The term also refers to any<br><br>
fragments and variants of GDF-8 that maintain at least some biological<br>
activities associated with mature GDF-8, as discussed herein, including<br>
sequences that have been modified. The amino acid sequence of mature<br>
human GDF-8 is provided in SEQ ID NO:49. The present invention relates to<br>
GDF-8 from all vertebrate species, including, but not limited to, human,<br>
bovine, chicken, mouse, rat, porcine, ovine, turkey, baboon, and fish (for<br>
sequence information, see, e.g., McPherron et al. (1997) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.<br>
U.S.A., 94:12457-12461).<br>
[0042] The term "mature GDF-8" refers to the protein that is cleaved<br>
from the carboxy-terminal domain of the GDF-8 precursor protein. The<br>
mature GDF-8 may be present as a monomer, homodimer, or in a GDF-8<br>
latent complex. Depending on conditions, mature GDF-8 may establish<br>
equilibrium between any or all of these different forms. In its biologically<br>
active form, the mature GDF-8 is also referred to as "active GDF-8."<br>
[0043] The term "GDF-8 propeptide" refers to the polypeptide that is<br>
cleaved from the amino-terminal domain of the GDF-8 precursor protein. The<br>
GDF-8 propeptide is capable of binding to the propeptide binding domain on<br>
the mature GDF-8.<br>
[0044] The term "GDF-8 latent complex" refers to the complex of<br>
proteins formed between the mature GDF-8 homodimer and the GDF-8<br>
propeptide. It is believed that two GDF-8 propeptides associate with two<br>
molecules of mature GDF-8 in the homodimer to form an inactive tetrameric<br>
complex. The latent complex may include other GDF inhibitors in place of or<br>
in addition to one or more of the GDF-8 propeptides.<br><br>
[0045] The term "GDF-8 activity" refers to one or more of<br>
physiologically growth-regulatory or morphogenetic activities associated with<br>
active GDF-8 protein. For example, active GDF-8 is a negative regulator of<br>
skeletal muscle mass. Active GDF-8 can also modulate the production of<br>
muscle-specific enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase), stimulate myoblast<br>
proliferation, and modulate preadipocyte differentiation to adipocytes.<br>
Exemplary procedures for measuring GDF-8 activity in vivo and in vitro are<br>
set forth in Examples 2, 3, 6, and 13.<br>
[0046] The term "GDF-8 inhibitor" includes any agent capable of<br>
inhibiting activity, expression, processing, or secretion of GDF-8. Such<br>
inhibitors include proteins, antibodies, peptides, peptidomimetics, ribozymes,<br>
anti-sense oligonucleotides, double-stranded RNA, and other small<br>
molecules, which specifically inhibit GDF-8. Such inhibitors are said to<br>
"inhibit," "neutralize," or "reduce" the biological activity of GDF-8.<br>
[0047] The terms "neutralize," "neutralizing," "inhibitory," and their<br>
cognates refer to a reduction in the activity of GDF-8 by a GDF-8 inhibitor,<br>
relative to the activity of GDF-8 in the absence of the same inhibitor. The<br>
reduction in activity is preferably at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,<br>
60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or higher.<br>
[0048] The term "treatment" is used interchangeably herein with the<br>
term "therapeutic method" and refers to both therapeutic treatment and<br>
prophylactic/preventative measures. Those in need of treatment may include<br>
individuals already having a particular medical disorder as well as those who<br>
may ultimately acquire the disorder (i.e., those needing preventative<br>
measures).<br>
[0049] The term "isolated" refers to a molecule that is substantially<br>
free of its natural environment. For instance, an isolated protein is<br>
substantially free of cellular material or other proteins from the cell or tissue<br>
source from which it is derived. The term refers to preparations where the<br>
isolated protein is sufficiently pure to be administered as a therapeutic<br>
composition, or at least 70% to 80% (w/w) pure, more preferably, at least<br>
80%-90% (w/w) pure, even more preferably, 90-95% pure; and, most<br>
preferably, at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (w/w) pure.<br>
[0050] The term "mammal" refers to any animal classified as such,<br>
including humans, domestic and farm animals, zoo, sports, or pet animals,<br>
such as dogs, horses, cats, sheep, pigs, cows, etc.<br>
[0051] The term "effective dose," or "effective amount," refers to that<br>
amount of the compound that results in amelioration of symptoms in a patient<br>
or a desired biological outcome (e.g., increasing skeletal muscle mass and/or<br>
bone density). Such amount should be sufficient to reduce the activity of<br>
GDF-8 associated with negative regulation of skeletal muscle mass and bone<br>
density. The effective amount can be determined as described in the<br>
subsequent sections.<br>
II. Antibodies Against GDF-8 and Antigen-Binding Fragments<br>
A. Human Antibodies Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22<br>
[0052] The present disclosure provides novel antibodies against<br>
GDF-8, and antigen-binding fragments thereof. Nonlimiting illustrative<br>
embodiments of such antibodies are termed Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22.<br>
These exemplary embodiments are provided in the form of human IgG-i<br>
antibodies.<br>
[0053] The antibodies of the invention possess unique and<br>
beneficial characteristics. First, these antibodies are capable of binding<br>
mature GDF-8 with high affinity. Second, the antibodies of the invention may<br>
inhibit GDF-8 activity in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated, for example, by<br>
inhibition of ActRIIB binding and reporter gene assays. The antibodies of the<br>
present invention are also capable of specifically binding and/or inhibiting<br>
activity of BMP-11 as demonstrated, for example, by inhibition of ActRIIB<br>
binding and reporter gene assays. Third, the disclosed antibodies may inhibit<br>
GDF-8 activity associated with negative regulation of skeletal muscle mass<br>
and bone density.<br>
[0054] In an exemplary embodiment, the presently disclosed<br>
antibodies are capable of specifically binding to both GDF-8 and BMP-11. It<br>
is contemplated that the antibodies may also react with other proteins, for<br>
example, those belonging to the TGF-p superfamily such as mullerian<br>
inhibiting substance, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, or growth and<br>
differentiation factors other than GDF-8. In certain embodiments, Myo29<br>
reacts with a protein comprising a sequence identical to amino acid 72 to 88<br>
of SEQ ID NO:49. In further embodiments, Myo29 binds to a protein<br>
comprising the sequence Lys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Pro-Xaa3-Asn (SEQ ID NO:54),<br>
wherein Xaa1, Xaa2, and Xaa3 each is any amino acid. In further<br>
embodiments, at least one of the following conditions is met: (1) Xaa1 = Met,<br>
(2) Xaa2 = Ser, and (3) Xaa3 = lie; all independently of each other. In other<br>
embodiments, Myo22 recognizes an epitope within the first 44 N-terminal<br>
amino acids in the sequence of mature GDF-8 (amino acids 1 through 44 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:49).<br>
[0055] One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that antibodies<br>
of the invention may be used to detect, measure, and inhibit proteins that<br>
differ from those stated above. In general, antibodies of the invention can be<br>
used with any protein that comprises a sequence which is at least about 70%,<br>
80%, 90%, 95%, or more identical to any sequence of at least 100, 80, 60, 40,<br>
or 20 of contiguous amino acids in the sequence of the mature form of GDF-8<br>
set forth SEQ ID NO:49. Nonlimiting examples of such proteins include<br>
sequences of GDF-8 derived from various species, which are described in the<br>
present specification. The percent identity is determined by standard<br>
alignment algorithms such as, for example, Basic Local Alignment Tool<br>
(BLAST) described in Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol., 215: 403-410, the<br>
algorithm of Needleman et al. (1970) J. Mol. Biol., 48:444-453, or the<br>
algorithm of Meyers et al. (1988) Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4: 11-17.<br>
B. Variable Domains<br>
[0056] Intact antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are<br>
typically tetrameric glycosylated proteins composed of two light (L) chains of<br>
approximately 25 kDa each and two heavy (H) chains of approximately 50<br>
kDa each. Two types of light chain, termed X and k, are found in antibodies.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of heavy<br>
chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to five major classes: A, D, £, G,<br>
and M, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes),<br>
e.g., Igd, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA1, and lgA2. The subunit structures and<br>
three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are<br>
well known in the art. For a review of the antibody structure, see Antibodies:<br>
A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, eds. Harlow et al.,<br>
1988. Briefly, each light chain is composed of an N-terminal variable (V)<br>
domain (Vl) and a constant (C) domain (CL). Each heavy chain is composed<br>
of an N-terminal V domain, three or four C domains, and a hinge region. The<br>
Ch domain most proximal to Vh is designated as Ch1 . The Vh and Vl domain<br>
consist of four regions of relatively conserved sequence called framework<br>
regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4), which form a scaffold for three regions of<br>
hypervariable sequence (complementarity determining regions, CDRs). The<br>
CDRs contain most of the residues responsible for specific interactions with<br>
the antigen. CDRs are referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. Accordingly,<br>
CDR constituents on the heavy chain are referred to as H1, H2, and H3, while<br>
CDR constituents on the light chain are referred to as L1, L2, and L3. CDR3<br>
is the greatest source of molecular diversity within the antibody-binding site.<br><br>
H3, for example, can be as short as two amino acid residues or greater than<br>
26. The smallest antigen-binding fragment is the Fv, which consist of the VH<br>
and VL domains. The Fab fragment (Fragment antigen binding) consists of<br>
the Vh-Ch1 and VL-CL domains covalently linked by a disulfide bond between<br>
the constant regions. To overcome the tendency of non-covalently linked VH<br>
and VL domains in the Fv to dissociate when co-expressed in a host cell, a<br>
so-called single chain (sc) Fv fragment (scFv) can be constructed, in which a<br>
flexible and adequately long polypeptide links either the C-terminus of the VH<br>
to the N-terminus of the VL or the C-terminus of the VL to the N-terminus of the<br>
VH. The most commonly used linker has been a T5-residue (Gly4Ser)3<br>
peptide, but other linkers are also known in the art.<br>
[0057] Antibody diversity is created by the use of multiple germiine<br>
genes encoding variable regions and a variety of somatic events. The<br>
somatic events include recombination of variable gene segments with<br>
diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments to make a complete VH region and<br>
the recombination of variable and joining gene segments to make a complete<br>
VL region. The recombination process itself is imprecise, resulting in the loss<br>
or addition of amino acids at the V(D)J junctions. These mechanisms of<br>
diversity occur in the developing B cell prior to antigen exposure. After<br>
antigenic stimulation, the expressed antibody genes in B cells undergo<br>
somatic mutation. Based on the estimated number of germiine gene<br>
segments, the random recombination of these segments, and random VH-VL<br>
pairing, up to 1.6 x 107 different antibodies could be produced (Fundamental<br>
Immunology, 3rd ed., ed. Paul, Raven Press, New York, NY, 1993). When<br><br>
other processes which contribute to antibody diversity (such as somatic<br>
mutation) are taken into account, it is thought that upwards of 1 x 1010 different<br>
antibodies could be generated (Immunoglobulin Genes, 2nd ed., eds. Jonio et<br>
al., Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1995). Because of the many processes<br>
involved in generating antibody diversity, it is unlikely that independently<br>
derived monoclonal antibodies with the same antigen specificity will have<br>
identical amino acid sequences.<br>
[0058] Thus, the present invention further provides novel CDRs<br>
derived from human immunoglobulin gene libraries. The structure for carrying<br>
a CDR of the invention will generally be an antibody heavy or light chain<br>
sequence or a substantial portion thereof, in which the CDR is located at a<br>
location corresponding to the CDR of naturally occurring VH and VL. The<br>
structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains may be<br>
determined as described in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,<br>
US Department of Health and Human Services, eds. Kabat et al., 1991.<br>
[0059] DNA and amino acid (AA) sequences of the presently<br>
disclosed antibodies, their scFV fragment, VH and VL domains, and CDRs are<br>
set forth in the Sequences Listing and are enumerated as listed in Table 1.<br>
For convenience, the positions for each CDR within VH and VL domains are<br>
listed in Table 2. The sequences of heavy and light chains excluding the VH<br>
and VL domains are identical in Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22.<br>
[0060] Presently disclosed antibodies may further comprise<br>
antibody constant regions or parts thereof. For example, a VL domain may be<br>
attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light chain constant domains<br>
including human Ck or CA chains, preferably CA chains. Similarly, a specific<br>
antigen-binding fragment based on a VH domain may be attached at its<br>
C-terminal end to all or part of an immunoglobulin heavy chain derived from<br>
any antibody isotype, e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM, and any of the isotype<br>
subclasses, particularly Igd and lgG4. In exemplary embodiments,<br>
antibodies comprise C-terminal fragments heavy and light chains of human<br>
IgGn. The DNA and amino acid sequences for the C-terminal fragment of the<br>
light A chain are set forth in SEQ ID NO:50 and SEQ ID NO:51, respectively.<br>
The DNA and amino acid sequences for the C-terminal fragment of IgG1<br>
heavy chain are set forth in SEQ ID NO:52 and SEQ ID NO:53, respectively.<br>
[0061] Certain embodiments of the invention comprise the VH and/or<br>
VL domain of the Fv fragment of Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22. Further<br>
embodiments comprise one or more complementarity determining regions<br>
(CDRs) of any of these VH and VL domains. One embodiment comprises an<br>
H3 fragment of the VH domain of Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22. The VH and VL<br>
domains of the invention, in certain embodiments, are germlined, i.e., the<br>
framework regions (FRs) of these domains are changed using conventional<br>
molecular biology techniques to match the consensus amino acid sequences<br>
of human germline gene products. In other embodiments, the framework<br>
sequences remain diverged from the germline.<br>
C. Modified Antibodies and Their Fragments<br>
[0062] A further aspect of the invention provides a method for<br>
obtaining an antibody antigen-binding domain specific for GDF-8. The skilled<br>
artisan will appreciate that the antibodies of the invention are not limited to the<br>
specific sequences of VH and VL as stated in Table 1 but also include variants<br>
of these sequences that retain antigen binding ability. Such variants may be<br>
derived from the provided sequences using techniques known in the art.<br>
Amino acid substitution, deletions, or additions, can be made in either the FRs<br>
or in the CDRs. While changes in the framework regions are usually<br>
designed to improve stability and reduce immunogenicity of the antibody,<br>
changes in the CDRs are usually designed to increase affinity of the antibody<br>
for its target. Such affinity-increasing changes are typically determined<br>
empirically by altering the CDR region and testing the antibody. Such<br>
alterations can be made according to the methods described in Antibody<br>
Engineering, 2nd. ed., ed. Borrebaeck, Oxford University Press, 1995.<br>
[0063] The method for making a VH domain which is an amino acid<br>
sequence variant of the VH domain set out herein comprises a step of adding,<br>
deleting, substituting or inserting one or more amino acids in the amino acid<br>
sequence of the presently disclosed VH domain, optionally combining the VH<br>
domain thus provided with one or more VL domains, and testing the VH<br>
domain or VH/VL combination or combinations for specific binding to GDF-8,<br>
optionally, testing the ability of such antigen-binding domain to neutralize<br>
GDF-8 activity. The VL domain may have an amino acid sequence which is<br>
substantially as set out herein.<br><br>
[0064] An analogous method may be employed in which one or<br>
more sequence variants of a VL domain disclosed herein are combined with<br>
one or more VH domains.<br>
[0065] A further aspect of the invention provides a method of<br>
preparing an antigen-binding fragment that specifically reacts with GDF-8.<br>
The method comprises:<br>
(a) providing a starting repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH<br>
domain which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding<br>
region;<br>
(b) combining the repertoire with a donor nucleic acid encoding an<br>
amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein for a VH CDR3 (i.e., H3)<br>
such that the donor nucleic acid is inserted into the CDR3 region in the<br>
repertoire so as to provide a product repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH<br>
domain;<br>
(c) expressing the nucleic acids of the product repertoire;<br>
(d) selecting a specific antigen-binding fragment specific for GDF-8;<br>
and<br>
(e) recovering the specific antigen-binding fragment or nucleic acid<br>
encoding it.<br>
[0066] Again, an analogous method may be employed in which a VL<br>
CDR3 (i.e., L3) of the invention is combined with a repertoire of nucleic acids<br>
encoding a VL domain, which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a<br>
CDR3 encoding region.<br>
[0067] A coding sequence CDR of the invention (e.g., CDR3) may<br>
be introduced into a repertoire of variable domains lacking a CDR (e.g.,<br>
CDR3), using recombinant DNA technology. For example, Marks et al.<br>
(Bio/Technology (1992) 10: 779-783) describe methods of producing<br>
repertoires of antibody variable domains in which consensus primers directed<br>
at or adjacent to the 5' end of the variable domain area are used in<br>
conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework region of human<br>
VH genes to provide a repertoire of VH variable domains lacking a CDR3. The<br>
repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular antibody. Using<br>
analogous techniques, the CDR3-derived sequences of the present invention<br>
may be shuffled with repertoires of VH or VL domains lacking a CDR3, and the<br>
shuffled complete VH or VL domains combined with a cognate VL or VH domain<br>
to provide specific antigen-binding fragments of the invention. The repertoire<br>
may then be displayed in a suitable host system such as the phage display<br>
system of WO 92/01047 so that suitable antigen-binding fragments can be<br>
selected.<br>
[0068] Analogous shuffling or combinatorial techniques are also<br>
disclosed by Stemmer (Nature (1994) 370: 389-391), who describes the<br>
technique in relation to a (3-lactamase gene but observes that the approach<br>
may be used for the generation of antibodies.<br>
[0069] A further alternative is to generate novel VH or VL regions<br>
carrying a CDR-derived sequences of the invention using random<br>
mutagenesis of one or more selected VH and/or VL genes to generate<br>
mutations within the entire variable domain. Such a technique is described by<br><br>
Gram et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1992) 89: 3576-3580), who used<br>
error-prone PCR.<br>
[0070] Another method that may be used is to direct mutagenesis to<br>
CDR regions of VH or VL genes. Such techniques are disclosed by Barbas et<br>
al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1994) 91: 3809-3813) and Schier et al. (J.<br>
Mol. Biol. (1996) 263: 551-567).<br>
[0071] Similarly, one or more, or all three CDRs may be grafted into<br>
a repertoire of VH or VL domains which are then screened for a specific<br>
binding partner or binding fragments specific for GDF-8.<br>
[0072] A substantial portion of an immunoglobulin variable domain<br>
will comprise at least the CDR regions and, optionally, their intervening<br>
framework regions from the scFv fragments as set out herein. The portion will<br>
also include at least about 50% of either or both of FR1 and FR4, the 50%<br>
being the C-terminal 50% of FR1 and the N-terminal 50% of FR4. Additional<br>
residues at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the substantial part of the<br>
variable domain may be those not normally associated with naturally<br>
occurring variable domain regions. For example, construction of specific<br>
antigen-binding fragments of the present invention made by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques may result in the introduction of N- or C-terminal residues encoded<br>
by linkers introduced to facilitate cloning or other manipulation steps. Other<br>
manipulation steps include the introduction of linkers to join variable domains<br>
of the invention to further protein sequences including immunoglobulin heavy<br>
chains, other variable domains (for example, in the production of diabodies) or<br>
protein labels as discussed in more details below.<br><br>
[0073] Although the embodiments illustrated in Examples comprise<br>
a "matching" pair of VL and VLdomains, the invention also encompasses<br>
binding fragments containing a single variable domain derived from either VH<br>
or VLdomain sequences, especially VHdomains. In the case of either of the<br>
single chain specific binding domains, these domains may be used to screen<br>
for complementary domains capable of forming a two-domain specific<br>
antigen-binding domain capable of binding GDF-8. This may be achieved by<br>
phage display screening methods using the so-called hierarchical dual<br>
combinatorial approach as disclosed in WO 92/01047 in which an individual<br>
colony containing either an H or L chain clone is used to infect a complete<br>
library of clones encoding the other chain (L or H) and the resulting two-chain<br>
specific antigen-binding domain is selected in accordance with phage display<br>
techniques such as those described in that reference. This technique is also<br>
disclosed in Marks et a!., supra.<br>
[0074] Antibodies can be conjugated by chemical methods with<br>
radionuclides, drugs, macromolecules, or other agents or can be made as<br>
fusion proteins comprising one or more CDRs of the invention.<br>
[0075] An antibody fusion protein contains a VH-VL pair where one<br>
of these chains (usually VH) and another protein are synthesized as a single<br>
polypeptide chain. These types of products differ from antibodies in that they<br>
generally have an additional functional element; the active moiety of a small<br>
molecule or the principal molecular structural feature of the conjugated or<br>
fused macromolecule.<br>
[0076] In addition to the changes to the amino acid sequence<br>
outlined above, the antibodies can be glycosylated, pegylated, or linked to<br>
albumin or a nonproteinaceous polymer. For instance, the presently<br>
disclosed antibodies may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous<br>
polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes,<br>
in the manner set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144;<br>
4,670,417; 4,791,192; or 4,179,337. The antibodies are chemically modified<br>
by covalent conjugation to a polymer to increase their circulating half-life, for<br>
example. Exemplary polymers, and methods to attach them to peptides are<br>
also shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,766,106; 4,179,337; 4,495,285; and<br>
4,609,546.<br>
[0077] In other embodiments, the antibody may be modified to have<br>
an altered glycosylation pattern (i.e., altered from the original or native<br>
glycosylation pattern). As used herein, "altered" means having one or more<br>
carbohydrate moieties deleted, and/or having one or more glycosylation sites<br>
added to the original antibody. Addition of glycosylation sites to the presently<br>
disclosed antibodies accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence to<br>
contain glycosylation site consensus sequences are well known in the art.<br>
Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the<br>
antibodies is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the amino<br>
acid residues of the antibody. These methods are described in WO 87/05330,<br>
and in Aplin and Wriston (1981) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., 22: 259-306.<br>
Removal of any carbohydrate moieties present on the antibodies may be<br>
accomplished chemically or enzymatically as described by Hakimuddin et al.<br><br>
(1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 259: 52; and Edge et al. (1981) Anal.<br>
Biochem., 118:131 and by Thotakura et al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol., 138: 350.<br>
[0078] Antibodies of the invention may also be tagged with a<br>
detectable or functional label. Detectable labels include radiolabels such as<br>
131l or 99Tc which may be attached to antibodies of the invention using<br>
conventional chemistry known in the art. Labels also include enzyme labels<br>
such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Labels further<br>
include chemical moieties such as biotin, which may be detected via binding<br>
to a specific cognate detectable moiety, e.g., labeled avidin.<br>
[0079] Antibodies, in which CDR sequences differ only<br>
insubstantially from those set out in SEQ ID NO.n, wherein n is 2,4,6, 8, 10,<br>
12, 14, 16,18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,<br>
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, or 48, are encompassed within the scope of this<br>
invention. Insubstantial differences include minor amino acid changes, such<br>
substitutions of 1 or 2 out of any 5 amino acids in the sequence of a CDR.<br>
Typically, an amino acid is substituted by a related amino acid having similar<br>
charge, hydrophobic, or stereochemical characteristics. Such substitutions<br>
would be within the ordinary skills of an artisan. Unlike in CDRs, more<br>
substantial changes in structure framework regions (FRs) can be made<br>
without adversely affecting the binding properties of an antibody. Changes to<br>
FRs include, but are not limited to, humanizing a non-human derived<br>
framework or engineering certain framework residues that are important for<br>
antigen contact or for stabilizing the binding site, e.g., changing the class or<br>
subclass of the constant region, changing specific amino acid residues which<br><br>
might alter an effector function such as Fc receptor binding (Lund et al. (1991)<br>
J. Immun. 147: 2657-2662 and Morgan et al. (1995) Immunology 86:<br>
319-324), or changing the species from which the constant region is derived.<br>
Antibodies may have mutations in the CH2 region of the heavy chain that<br>
reduce or alter effector function, e.g., Fc receptor binding and complement<br>
activation. For example, antibodies may have mutations such as those<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260. In the IgG1 or lgG2<br>
heavy chain, for example, such mutations may be made at amino acid<br>
residues 117 and 120 of SEQ ID NO:53, which represents the Fc portion of<br>
IgG1 (these residues correspond to amino acids 234 and 237 in the full-length<br>
sequence of IgG1 or lgG2). Antibodies may also have mutations that stabilize<br>
the disulfide bond between the two heavy chains of an immunoglobulin, such<br>
as mutations in the hinge region of lgG4, as disclosed in Angal et al. (1993)<br>

D. Nucleic Acids, Cloning and Expression Systems<br>
[0080] The present invention further provides an isolated nucleic<br>
acid encoding antibodies or binding fragments of the present invention.<br>
Nucleic acid according to the present invention may comprise DNA or RNA<br>
and may be wholly or partially synthetic. Reference to a nucleotide sequence<br>
as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence,<br>
and encompasses a RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is<br>
substituted for T, unless context requires otherwise.<br>
[0081] The nucleic acid of the invention comprises a coding<br>
sequence for a CDR or VH or VL domain of the invention as set forth herein.<br>
[0082] The present invention also provides constructs in the form of<br>
plasmids, vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at<br>
least one nucleic acid of the invention as above.<br>
[0083] The present invention also provides a host cell, which<br>
comprises one or more constructs as above. A nucleic acid encoding any<br>
CDR (H1, H2, H3, L1, L2, or L3), VH or VL domain, or specific antigen-binding<br>
fragment as provided herein forms an aspect of the present invention, as does<br>
a method of production of the encoded product. The method comprises<br>
expression from the encoding nucleic acid. Expression may be achieved by<br>
culturing under appropriate conditions recombinant host cells containing the<br>
nucleic acid. Following production by expression a VHor VLdomain, or<br>
specific antigen-binding fragment may be isolated and/or purified using any<br>
suitable technique, then used as appropriate.<br>
[0084] Specific antigen-binding fragments, VH and/or VLdomains,<br>
and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors according to the present<br>
invention may be provided isolated and/or purified, e.g., from their natural<br>
environment, in substantially pure or homogeneous form, or, in the case of<br>
nucleic acid, free or substantially free of nucleic acid or genes of origin other<br>
than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the required function.<br>
[0085] Systems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a<br>
variety of different host cells are well known. Suitable host cells include<br>
bacteria, mammalian cells, and yeast and baculovirus systems. Mammalian<br><br>
cell lines available in the art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide<br>
include Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells,<br>
NSO mouse melanoma cells and many others. A common bacterial host is E.<br>
coli. For cells suitable for producing antibodies, see Gene Expression<br>
Systems, eds. Fernandez et al., Academic Press, 1999. Any cell compatible<br>
with the present invention may be used to produce the presently disclosed<br>
antibodies.<br>
[0086] Suitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, containing<br>
appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator<br>
sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes<br>
and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids or viral, e.g.,<br>
phage, or phagemid, as appropriate. For further details see, for example,<br>
Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual: 2nd ed., Sambrook et al., Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. Many known techniques and<br>
protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example, in preparation of<br>
nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into<br>
cells and gene expression, and analysis of proteins, are described in detail in<br>
Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2nd ed., Ausubel et al. eds., John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992.<br>
[0087] Thus, a further aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
host cell comprising nucleic acid as disclosed herein. A still further aspect<br>
provides a method comprising introducing such nucleic acid into a host cell.<br>
The introduction may employ any available technique. For eukaryotic cells,<br>
suitable techniques may include calcium phosphate transfection,<br><br>
DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and<br>
transduction using retrovirus or other virus, e.g., vaccinia or, for insect cells,<br>
baculovirus. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium<br>
chloride transformation, electroporation and transfection using bacteriophage.<br>
[0088] The introduction may be followed by causing or allowing<br>
expression from the nucleic acid, e.g., by cuituring host cells under conditions<br>
for expression of the gene.<br>
E. Biological Deposits<br>
[0089] E. coli cultures individually transformed with the phagemid<br>
vector pCANTAB6 encoding nongermlined scFv's Myo29, Myo28, or Myo22<br>
were deposited on October 2, 2002, at American Tissue Culture Collection<br>
(ATCC) under respective Deposit Designation Numbers PTA-4741,<br>
PTA-4740, and PTA-4739. The address of the depository is 10801 University<br>
Blvd, Manassas, VA20110, U.S.A.<br>
II. Methods of Treating Disease and Other Uses<br>
[0090] The antibodies of the present invention are useful to prevent,<br>
diagnose, or treat various medical disorders in humans or animals. The<br>
antibodies can be used to inhibit or reduce one or more activities associated<br>
with GDF-8, or a related protein. Most preferably, the antibodies inhibit or<br>
reduce one or more of the activities of GDF-8 relative to the GDF-8 that is not<br>
bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, the activity of GDF-8, when<br>
bound by one or more of the presently disclosed antibodies, is inhibited at<br>
least 50%, preferably at least 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 72, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84,<br><br>
86, or 88%, more preferably at least 90, 91, 92, 93, or 94%, and even more<br>
preferably at least 95% to 100% relative to a mature GDF-8 protein that is not<br>
bound by one or more of the presently disclosed antibodies. Inhibition of<br>
GDF-8 activity can be measured in pGL3(CAGA)i2 reporter gene assays<br>
(RGA) as described in Thies et al. (Growth Factors (2001) 18: 251-259) and<br>
as illustrated in Examples 2 and 9, or in Act RUB receptor assays as illustrated<br>
in Examples 3 and 6.<br>
[0091] The medical disorder being diagnosed, treated, or prevented<br>
by the presently disclosed antibodies is a muscle or neuromuscular disorder;<br>
an adipose tissue disorder such as obesity; type 2 diabetes; impaired glucose<br>
tolerance; metabolic syndromes (e.g., syndrome X); insulin resistance<br>
induced by trauma such as burns or nitrogen imbalance; or bone<br>
degenerative disease such as osteoporosis.<br>
[0092] Other medical disorders being diagnosed, treated, or<br>
prevented by the presently disclosed antibodies are disorders associated with<br>
a loss of bone, which include osteoporosis, especially in the elderly and/or<br>
postmenopausal women, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, osteopenia,<br>
osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis-related fractures. Other target metabolic<br>
bone diseases and disorders include low bone mass due to chronic<br>
glucocorticoid therapy, premature gonadal failure, androgen suppression,<br>
vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, nutritional deficiencies,<br>
and anorexia nervosa. The antibodies are preferably used to prevent,<br>
diagnose, or treat such medical disorders in mammals, especially, in humans.<br>
[0093] The antibodies or antibody compositions of the present<br>
invention are administered in therapeutically effective amounts. Generally, a<br>
therapeutically effective amount may vary with the subject's age, condition,<br>
and sex, as well as the severity of the medical condition in the subject. The<br>
dosage may be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit<br>
observed effects of the treatment. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such<br>
compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell<br>
cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose<br>
lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically<br>
effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and<br>
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the<br>
ratio LD50/ED50. Antibodies that exhibit large therapeutic indices are<br>
preferred.<br>
[0094] The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal<br>
studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The<br>
dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating<br>
concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may<br>
vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the<br>
route of administration utilized. For any antibody used in the present<br>
invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell<br>
culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a<br>
circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 {i.e., the<br>
concentration of the test antibody which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of<br>
symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Levels in plasma may be measured,<br><br>
for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any<br>
particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. Examples of<br>
suitable bioassays include DNA replication assays, transcription-based<br>
assays, GDF-8 protein/receptor binding assays, creatine kinase assays,<br>
assays based on the differentiation of pre-adipocytes, assays based on<br>
glucose uptake in adipocytes, and immunological assays.<br>
[0095] Generally, the compositions are administered so that<br>
antibodies or their binding fragments are given at a dose from 1 µg/ kg to 150<br>
mg/kg, 1 µg/ kg to 100 mg/kg, 1 µg/ kg to 50 mg/kg, 1 µg/ kg to 20 mg/kg, 1<br>
µg/ kg to 10 mg/kg, 1 µg/ kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 µg/ kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 µg/ kg to 100<br>
µg/ kg, 100 ug to 1 mg/kg, and 500 µg/ kg to 1 mg/kg. Preferably, the<br>
antibodies are given as a bolus dose, to maximize the circulating levels of<br>
antibodies for the greatest length of time after the dose. Continuous infusion<br>
may also be used after the bolus dose.<br>
[0096] The methods of treating, diagnosing, or preventing the above<br>
medical conditions with the presently disclosed antibodies can also be used<br>
on other proteins in the TGF-B superfamily. Many of these proteins are<br>
related in structure to GDF-8, such as BMP-11. Accordingly, another<br>
embodiment provides methods of treating the aforementioned disorders by<br>
administering to a subject an antibody capable of inhibiting BMP-11 or activin,<br>
either alone or in combination with other TGF-ß inhibitors, such as a<br>
neutralizing antibody against GDF-8. The antibodies of the invention may<br>
also be used to treat a disease or condition associated with or mediated by<br>
BMP-11. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,639,638 and 6,437,111.<br><br>
[0097] The antibodies of the present invention may be used to<br>
detect the presence of proteins belonging to the TGF-ß superfamily, such as<br>
BMP-11 and GDF-8, in vivo or in vitro. By correlating the presence or level of<br>
these proteins with a medical condition, one of skill in the art can diagnose the<br>
associated medical condition. The medical conditions that may be diagnosed<br>
by the presently disclosed antibodies are set forth above.<br>
[0098] Such detection methods are well known in the art and<br>
include ELISA, radioimmunoassay, immunoblot, Western blot,<br>
immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and other comparable techniques.<br>
The antibodies may further be provided in a diagnostic kit that incorporates<br>
one or more of these techniques to detect a protein (e.g., GDF-8). Such a kit<br>
may contain other components, packaging, instructions, or other material to<br>
aid the detection of the protein and use of the kit.<br>
[0099] Where the antibodies are intended for diagnostic purposes, it<br>
may be desirable to modify them, for example, with a ligand group {such as<br>
biotin) or a detectable marker group (such as a fluorescent group, a<br>
radioisotope or an enzyme). If desired, the antibodies (whether polyclonal or<br>
monoclonal) may be labeled using conventional techniques. Suitable labels<br>
include fluorophores, chromophores, radioactive atoms, electron-dense<br>
reagents, enzymes, and ligands having specific binding partners. Enzymes<br>
are typically detected by their activity. For example, horseradish peroxidase<br>
can be detected by its ability to convert tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue<br>
pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer. Other suitable labels may<br>
include biotin and avidin or streptavidin, IgG and protein A, and the numerous<br><br>
receptor-ligand couples known in the art. Other permutations and possibilities<br>
will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are considered<br>
as equivalents within the scope of the instant invention.<br>
[0100] Yet another aspect of the invention provides a method of<br>
identifying therapeutic agents useful in treatment of muscle and bone disorders.<br>
Appropriate screening assays, e.g., ELISA-based assays, are known in the art.<br>
In such a screening assay, a first binding mixture is formed by combining an<br>
antibody of the invention and a ligand, e.g., GDF-8, BMP-11, activin; and the<br>
amount of binding between the ligand and the antibody in the first binding<br>
mixture (M0) is measured. A second binding mixture is also formed by<br>
combining the antibody, the ligand, and a compound or agent to be screened,<br>
and the amount of binding between the ligand and the antibody in the second<br>
binding mixture (M1) is measured. The amounts of binding in the first and<br>
second binding mixtures are then compared, for example, by calculating the<br>
M1/M0 ratio. The compound or agent is considered to be capable of inhibiting<br>
GDF-8 activity if a decrease in binding in the second binding mixture as<br>
compared to the first binding mixture is observed. The formulation and<br>
optimization of binding mixtures is within the level of skill in the art, such<br>
binding mixtures may also contain buffers and salts necessary to enhance or to<br>
optimize binding, and additional control assays may be included in the<br>
screening assay of the invention.<br>
[0101] Compounds found to reduce the antibody-ligand binding by at<br>
least about 10% (i.e., M1/M0
be identified and then, if desired, secondarily screened for the capacity to<br><br>
inhibit GDF-8 activity in other assays such as the ActRIIB binding assay<br>
(Example 2), and other cell-based and in vivo assays as described in Examples<br>
13,15, and 16.<br>
III. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration<br>
[0102] The present invention provides compositions comprising the<br>
presently disclosed antibodies. Such compositions may be suitable for<br>
pharmaceutical use and administration to patients. The compositions typically<br>
comprise one or more antibodies of the present invention and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. As used herein, the phrase<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" includes any and all solvents,<br>
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and<br>
absorption delaying agents, and the like, that are compatible with<br>
pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for<br>
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. The compositions<br>
may also contain other active compounds providing supplemental, additional,<br>
or enhanced therapeutic functions. The pharmaceutical compositions may also<br>
be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for<br>
administration.<br>
[0103] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to<br>
be compatible with its intended route of administration. Methods to accomplish<br>
the administration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It may also be<br>
possible to obtain compositions which may be topically or orally administered,<br>
or which may be capable of transmission across mucous membranes. The<br>
administration may, for example, be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular,<br>
intracavity, subcutaneous or transdermal.<br>
[0104] Solutions or suspensions used for intradermal or<br>
subcutaneous application typically include one or more of the following<br>
components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed<br>
oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic<br>
solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens;<br>
antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or<br>
phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride<br>
or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric<br>
acid or sodium hydroxide. Such preparations may be enclosed in ampoules,<br>
disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
[0105] Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injection include<br>
sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the<br>
extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For<br>
intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline,<br>
bacteriostatic water, Cremophor™ EL (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should<br>
be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the<br>
contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The<br>
carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water,<br>
ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid<br><br>
polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper<br>
fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin,<br>
by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and<br>
by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be<br>
achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it<br>
will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols<br>
such as mannitol, sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged<br>
absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in<br>
the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum<br>
monostearate and gelatin.<br>
[0106] Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an<br>
edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into<br>
tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the antibodies can<br>
be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, or capsules.<br>
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be<br>
included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like<br>
can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature;<br>
a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an<br>
excipient such as starch or lactose; a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid,<br>
Primogel™, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or<br>
Sterotes™; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such<br>
as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl<br>
salicylate, or orange flavoring.<br><br>
[0107] For administration by inhalation, antibodies are delivered in<br>
the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser, which<br>
contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a<br>
nebulizer.<br>
[0108] Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or<br>
transdermal means. For example, in case of antibodies that comprise the Fc<br>
portion, compositions may be capable of transmission across mucous<br>
membranes (e.g., intestine, mouth, or lungs) via the FcRn receptor-mediated<br>
pathway (U.S. Patent No. 6,030,613). Transmucosal administration can be<br>
accomplished, for example, through the use of lozenges, nasal sprays,<br>
inhalers, or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active<br>
compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally<br>
known in the art. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants<br>
appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such<br>
penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, detergents,<br>
bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives.<br>
[0109] The presently disclosed antibodies may be prepared with<br>
carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body,<br>
such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and<br>
microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers<br>
can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid,<br>
collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such<br>
formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions<br>
containing the presently disclosed antibodies can also be used as<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,522,811.<br>
[0110] It may be advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral<br>
compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of<br>
dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units<br>
suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The<br>
specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and<br>
directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and<br>
the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in<br>
the art of formulating such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.<br>
[0111] The following examples provide illustrative embodiments of<br>
the invention which do not in any way limit the invention. One of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will recognize the numerous other embodiments are encompassed<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0112] The entire contents of all references, patents and published<br>
patent applications cited throughout this application are herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Purification of GDF-8<br>
[0113] Conditioned media from a selected cell line expressing<br>
recombinant human GDF-8 protein (mature GDF-8 and GDF-8 propeptide) was<br>
acidified to pH 6.5 and applied to a 80 x 50 mm POROS™ HQ anion exchange<br>
column in tandem to a 80 x 50 mm POROS™ SP cation exchange column<br>
(PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The flow through was adjusted to<br>
pH 5.0 and applied to a 75 x 20 mm POROS™ SP cation exchange column<br>
(PerSeptive Biosystems) and eluted with a NaCI gradient. Fractions containing<br>
the GDF-8 latent complex, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, acidified<br>
with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to pH 2-3, then brought up to 200 ml with 0.1%<br>
TFA to lower the viscosity. The pool was then applied to a 250 x 21.2 mm C5<br>
column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) preceded by a 60 x 21.2 mm guard<br>
column (Phenomenex) and eluted with a TFA/acetonitrile gradient, to separate<br>
mature GDF-8 from GDF-8 propeptide. Pooled fractions containing mature<br>
GDF-8 were concentrated by lyophilization to remove the acetonitrile and 20 ml<br>
of 0.1% TFA was added. The sample was then applied to a 250 x 10 mm C5<br>
column (Phenomenex) heated to 60°C to aid in separation. This was repeated<br>
until further separation could no longer be achieved. Fractions containing<br>
mature GDF-8 were then pooled and brought up to 40% acetonitrile and<br>
applied to a 600 x 21.2 BioSep™ S-3000 size exclusion column (Phenomenex)<br>
preceded by a 60 x 21.2 guard column. Fractions containing purified mature<br>
GDF-8 were pooled and concentrated for use in subsequent experiments.<br><br>
[0114] On SDS-PAGE, purified mature GDF-8 migrated as a broad<br>
band at 25 kDa under nonreducing conditions and 13 kDa under reducing<br>
conditions. A similar SDS-PAGE profile has been reported for murine GDF-8<br>
by McPherron et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1997) 94:12457-12461) and<br>
reflects the dimeric nature of the mature protein. The active mature BMP-11<br>
dimer was purified from conditioned media from a cell line expressing<br>
recombinant human BMP-11 in a similar manner.<br>
[0115] Active mature BMP-11 was purified from conditioned media<br>
from a cell line expressing recombinant human GDF-8 propeptide/mature<br>
BMP-11 chimeric protein. The conditioned medium was loaded onto a 10 ml<br>
TALON™ column (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA) in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0,1 M NaCI at<br>
1 mi/min. The bound protein was eluted with a 50 mM Tris pH 8.0,1 M NaCI,'<br>
500 mM Imidazole. Pooled fractions containing the GDF-8 propeptide/BMP-11<br>
latent complex were acidified with 10% TFA to a pH of 3. The pool was then<br>
applied to a 250 x 4.6 mm Jupiter C4 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA)<br>
which was heated to 60°C for better separation of mature BMP-11 and GDF-8<br>
propeptide, and eluted with a TFA/acetonitrile gradient. Pooled fractions<br>
containing mature BMP-11 were concentrated by lyophilization. On<br>
SDS-PAGE, purified mature BMP-11 migrated at 25 kDa under non-reducing<br>
conditions and at 12 kDa under reducing conditions.<br>
Example 2: Biological Activity of Purified Recombinant Human GDF-8<br>
[0116] To demonstrate the activity of GDF-8, a reporter gene assay<br>
(RGA) was developed using a reporter vector pGL3(CAGA)12 expressing<br><br>
luciferase. The CAGA sequence was previously reported to be a TGF-ß<br>
responsive sequence within the promoter of the TGF-p induced gene PAI-1<br>
(Denner et al. (1998) EMBO J., 17: 3091-3100).<br>
[0117] A reporter vector containing 12 CAGA boxes was made using<br>
the basic luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 (Promega, Madison, Wl). The<br>
TATA box and transcription initiation site from the adenovirus major later<br>
promoter (-35/+10) was inserted between the Bglll and Hindlll sites.<br>
Oligonucleotides containing 12 repeats of the CAGA boxes AGCCAGACA were<br>
annealed and cloned into the Xhol site. The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell<br>
line A204 (ATCC HTB-82) was transiently transfected with pGL3(CAGA)12<br>
using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Boehringer Manheim, Germany).<br>
Following transfection, cells were cultured on 48 well plates in McCoy's 5A<br>
medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml streptomycin, 100 µg/ ml<br>
penicillin and 10% fetal calf serum for 16 hrs. Cells were then treated with or<br>
without 10 ng/ml GDF-8 in McCoy's 5A media with glutamine, streptomycin,<br>
penicillin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 6 hrs at 37°C. Luciferase was<br>
quantified in the treated cells using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).<br>
[0118] Figure 4A shows that GDF-8 maximally activated the reporter<br>
construct 10-fold, with an ED50 of 10 ng/ml, indicating that purified recombinant<br>
GDF-8 was biologically active. BMP-11 and activin elicited a similar biological<br>
response.<br>
Example 3: Binding Properties of Purified GDF-8 in the ActRIIB<br>
Binding Assay<br>
[0119] The GDF-8 latent complex was biotinylated at a ratio of 20<br>
moles of EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois, Cat. No. 21217) to<br>
1 mole of the GDF-8 complex for 2 hours on ice. The reaction was terminated<br>
by dropping the pH using 0.5% TFA and the complex was subjected to<br>
chromatography on a C4 Jupiter 250 x 4.6 mm column (Phenomenex) to<br>
separate mature GDF-8 from GDF-8 propeptide. Biotinylated mature GDF-8<br>
fractions eluted with a TFA/CH3CN gradient were pooled, concentrated and<br>
quantified by MicroBCA™ protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, Cat.<br>
No. 23235).<br>
[0120] Biotinylated mature BMP-11 was prepared from BMP-11 latent<br>
complex in the same manner as described above. Recombinant ActRIIB-Fc<br>
chimera (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, Cat. No. 339-RB/CF) was coated on<br>
96-well flat-bottom assay plates (Costar, NY, Cat. No. 3590) at 1 µg/ ml in 0.2 M<br>
sodium carbonate buffer overnight at 4°C. Plates were then blocked with 1<br>
mg/ml bovine serum albumin and washed following standard ELISA protocol.<br>
100 µl aliquots of biotinylated GDF-8 or BMP-11 at various concentrations were<br>
added to the blocked ELISA plate, incubated for 1 hr, washed, and the amount<br>
of bound GDF-8 or BMP-11 was detected by Streptavidin-Horseradish<br>
peroxidase (SA-HRP, BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, Cat. No. 13047E)<br>
followed by the addition of TMB (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, Cat. No. 50-76-04).<br>
Colorimetric measurements were done at 450 nM in a Molecular Devices<br>
microplate reader.<br>
[0121] As shown in Figure 1, biotinylated GDF-8 and BMP-11 bound<br>
to ActRIIB, the putative GDF-8 type II receptor with an ED50 of 15 and 40 ng/ml,<br>
respectively, indicating that the ActRIIB binding assay is a sensitive in vitro<br>
binding assay for GDF-8 and BMP11.<br>
Example 4: Isolation of Myo22 by Panning of scFv Libraries on GDF-8<br>
[0122] An scFv phagemid library, which is an expanded version of<br>
the 1.38 x 1010 library described (Vaughan et al. (1996) Nature Biotech., 14:<br>
309-314), was used to select antibodies specific for GDF-8. Soluble GDF-8<br>
protein (at 10 ng/ml in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was coated<br>
onto wells of a microtitre plate overnight at 4°C. Wells were washed in PBS<br>
and blocked for 2 hrs at 37°C in MPBS (3% Marvel™ skimmed milk powder in<br>
PBS). Purified phage (1012 transducing units (tu)) in 100 I of 3% MPBS were<br>
added to blocked wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Wells<br>
were washed 10 times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween™ 20), then<br>
10 times with PBS. Bound phage particles were eluted with 100 µl of 100 mM<br>
triethylamine for 10 minutes at room temperature, then immediately neutralized<br>
with 50 µl of 1 M Tris-HCI pH 7.4. The eluted phage was used to infect 10 ml<br>
exponentially growing E. coli TG1. Infected cells were grown in 2TY broth for<br>
30 minutes at 37°C stationary, followed by 30 minutes at 37°C with aeration,<br>
then streaked onto 2TYAG plates and incubated overnight at 30°C. Colonies<br>
were scraped off the plates into 10 ml 2TY broth and 15% glycerol added for<br>
storage at -70°C.<br>
[0123] Glycerol stock cultures from the first round panning selection<br>
were superinfected with helper phage and rescued to give scFv<br>
antibody-expressing phage particles for the second round of panning. A total of<br>
three rounds of panning were carried out in this way.<br>
Example 5: Selection of Myo28 and Myo29 from scFv Libraries<br>
[0124] Soluble selections were carried out using biotinylated GDF-8<br>
protein (bioGDF-8). BioGDF-8 was used at a concentration of 1 µg/ ml. An<br>
scFv library, as described in Example 4, was used. Purified scFv phage (1012<br>
tu) in 100 ul 3% MPBS were blocked for 30 minutes, then biotinylated antigen<br>
was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Phage/antigen was<br>
added to 50 ul of Dynal™ M280 streptavidin magnetic beads that had been<br>
blocked for 1 hour at 37°C in 1 ml of 3% MPBS and incubated for a further 15<br>
minutes at room temperature. Beads were captured using a magnetic rack and<br>
washed four times in 1 ml of 3% MPBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween™ 20 followed by<br>
three washes in PBS. After the last PBS wash, beads were resuspended in<br>
100 µl PBS and used to infect 5 ml exponentially growing E. coli TG-1 cells.<br>
Cells and phage were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C (30 minutes stationary, 30<br>
minutes shaking at 250 rpm), and then spread on 2TYAG plates. Plates were<br>
incubated at 30°C overnight and colonies visualized the next day. Output<br>
colonies were scraped off the plates and phage rescued as described above.<br>
A second round of soluble selection was carried out as described above.<br>
Example 6: ActRIIB Receptor Inhibition Assay and Screen<br>
[0125] Output colonies, obtained as described in Examples 4 and 5,<br>
were picked into 96 well plates containing 100 µl of 2TYAG. ScFv production<br>
was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG to exponentially growing cultures and<br>
incubation overnight at 30°C. Crude scFv-containing culture supernatants were<br>
screened for the ability to inhibit the binding of bioGDF-8 to ActRIIB essentially<br>
as described in Example 3. The assay was modified slightly in that binding of<br>
bioGDF-8 was detected with Europium-labeled streptavidin and using the<br>
DELFIA™ reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) in time-resolved<br>
fluorometric assays (TRF). Positive clones, showing inhibition of binding signal<br>
greater than irrelevant clones, were picked and assayed to confirm activity.<br>
[0126] Purified scFv from positive clones identified from the receptor<br>
inhibition screen was tested in the inhibition assay as above. A titration of scFv<br>
concentrations was used in order to establish clone potency as measured by<br>
IC50 values in the assay. The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 2.<br>
As determined in these assays, IC50 for scFv's of Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22<br>
are 2.4 nM, 1.7 nM, and 60 nM, respectively. Therefore, these antibodies are<br>
potent inhibitors of GDF-8 activity.<br>
Example 7: Specificity Characterization by Phage ELISA<br>
[0127] To determine the specificity of antibodies, a phage ELISA was<br>
performed for positive clones from the ActRIIB screen against GDF-8 and<br>
unrelated proteins. Individual E. coli colonies containing phagemid were<br>
inoculated into 96 well plates containing 100 µl 2TYAG medium per well.<br>
M13K07 helper phage was added to a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 to<br>
exponentially growing culture and the plates incubated a further 1 hour at 37°C.<br>
Plates were centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes.<br>
The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µl<br>
2TYAK and incubated at 30°C overnight with shaking. The next day, plates<br>
were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and 100 µl phage-containing<br>
supernatant from each well transferred to a fresh 96 well plate. Phage samples<br>
were blocked in a final concentration of 3% MPBS for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature, prior to ELISA.<br>
[0128] GDF-8 or irrelevant protein was coated overnight at 4°C onto<br>
96-well microtiter plates at 1 µg/ml. After coating, the solutions were removed<br>
from the wells, and the plates blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in 3%<br>
MPBS. Plates were rinsed with PBS then 50 µl of pre-blocked phage added to<br>
each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then<br>
washed with 3 changes of PBST followed by 3 changes of PBS. To each well,<br>
50 µl of a 1:5000 dilution of anti-M13-HRP conjugate (Pharmacia) was added<br>
and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Each plate was<br>
washed three times with PBST then 3 times with PBS. Fifty microliters of TMB<br>
substrate was added to each well and incubated until color development. The<br>
reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 µl of 0.5 M H2SO4. The signal<br>
generated was measured by reading the absorbance at 450 nm using a<br>
microtiter plate reader. Specific binding to GDF-8 was confirmed.<br>
Example 8: Sequencing of scFv, Conversion to IgG, and Germlining<br>
[0129] Neutralizing scFv E. coli clones were streaked out onto<br>
2TYAG plates and incubated overnight at 30°C. Triplicate colonies from these<br>
plates were sequenced using pCANTAB6 vector sequence oligos to amplify the<br>
VHand VL regions from the scFv clone. DNA sequences of the scFv fragments<br>
used for making Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22 IgG's are represented by SEQ ID<br>
NO:13, SEQ ID NO:7, and SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively.<br>
[0130] Heavy and light chain V regions from scFv clones were<br>
amplified using PCR and clone-specific primers. PCR products were digested<br>
with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into vectors containing<br>
human IgG1 heavy chain constant domain (for VHdomains) or vectors<br>
containing human lambda light chain constant domain as appropriate (for VL<br>
domains). Correct insertion of V region domains into plasmids was verified by<br>
sequencing of plasmid DNA from individual E. coli colonies. Plasmids were<br>
prepared from E. coli cultures by standard techniques and heavy and light<br>
chain constructs co-transfected into COS cells using standard techniques.<br>
Secreted IgG was purified using Protein A Sepharose (Pharmacia, Peapack,<br>
NJ) and buffer exchanged into PBS.<br>
[0131] Sequence data for the scFv clones was used to identify the<br>
nearest germline sequence for the heavy and light chain of each clone.<br>
Appropriate mutations were made using standard site directed mutagenesis<br>
techniques with the appropriate mutagenic primers. Mutation of scFv<br>
sequences was confirmed by sequence analysis. Germlined scFv and VH and<br>
VL domain sequences for Myo28 and Myo29 are set forth in SEQ ID NO:19 and<br>
SEQ ID NO:25, respectively.<br>
Example 9: Biological Activity of Antibodies<br>
[0132] Figure 3A shows that preincubation of Myo29 with biotinylated<br>
GDF-8 at 10 ng/ml inhibited GDF-8 binding to ActRHB in the ActRIIB binding<br>
assay, as described in Example 3, with an IC50 of 0.2-0.4 nM. Similarly in<br>
Figure 3B, Myo29 inhibited biotinylated BMP-11 binding to ActRIIB with the<br>
same IC50.<br>
[0133] Myo29 also blocked GDF-8 activity in an in vitro bioassay. By<br>
way of example, when GDF-8 was preincubated with Myo29 for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature, the biological activity of GDF-8 was reduced as determined in<br>
RGA assays performed essentially as described in Example 2. Figure 4C<br>
shows induction of pGL3(CAGA)12 reporter activity at the ED50 for GDF-8, 20<br>
ng/ml, in the presence of Myo29. Myo29 reduced the GDF-8 induction in a<br>
dose-responsive manner, with an IC50 of 15-30 ng/ml (0.1-0.2 nM). Myo29 also<br>
inhibited the biological activity of BMP-11 to the same extent (Figure 4B). In<br>
contrast, the activity of activin in this assay was not affected by Myo29 (Figure<br>
4D), presumably due to the relatively low homology between GDF-8 and<br>
activin, as compared to GDF-8 and BMP-11.<br>
[0134] Myo22 and Myo28 were also tested in the RGA and ActRIIB<br>
binding assays. Both antibodies block GDF-8 and BMP-11 activity. The IC50<br>
for Myo28, for example, is 0.2-0.35 nM.<br>
Example 10: Mapping of Epitopes for Myo22, Myo28, and Myo29<br>
[0135] In order to map the exact epitope of the antibodies, 48<br>
overlapping 13-residue peptides representing the entire sequence of mature<br>
GDF-8 set forth in SEQ ID NO:49 were synthesized directly on cellulose paper<br>
using the spot synthesis technique (Molina et al. (1996) Peptide Research,<br>
9:151-155; Frank et al. (1992) Tetrahedron, 48: 9217-9232). The overlap of the<br>
peptides was 11 amino acids. In this array, cysteine residues were replaced<br>
with serine in order to reduce the chemical complications that are caused by<br>
the presence of cysteines. Cellulose membranes modified with polyethylene<br>
glycol and Fmoc-protected amino acids were purchased from Abimed<br>
(Lagenfeld, Germany). The array was defined on the membrane by coupling a<br>
B-alanine spacer and peptides were synthesized using standard DIC<br>
(diisopropylcarbodiimide)/HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole) coupling chemistry as<br>
described previously (Molina et al. (1996) Peptide Research, 9:151-155; Frank<br>
et al. (1992) Tetrahedron, 48: 9217-9232).<br>
[0136] Activated amino acids were spotted using an Abimed ASP 222<br>
robot. Washing and deprotection steps were done manually and the peptides<br>
were N-terminally acetylated after the final synthesis cycle. Following peptide<br>
synthesis, the membrane was washed in methanol for 10 minutes and in<br>
blocker (TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween™ 20) and 1% (w/v)<br>
casein) for 10 minutes. The membrane was then incubated with 2.5 µg/ ml of<br>
an anti-GDF-8 antibody in blocker for 1 hour with gentle shaking. After washing<br>
with blocker 3 times for 10 minutes, the membrane was incubated with<br>
HRP-labeled secondary antibody (0.25 µg/ ml in blocker) for 30 minutes. The<br><br>
membrane was then washed three times for 10 minutes each with blocker and<br>
2 times for 10 minutes each with TBST. Bound antibody was visualized using<br>
SuperSignal™ West reagent (Pierce) and a digital camera (Alphananotech<br>
Fluoromager). Results are shown in Figure 5. In particular, as seen from<br>
Figure 5, the epitope for Myo29 was mapped between amino acids 72 and 88<br>
of mature GDF-8. Myo22, on the other hand, recognizes an epitope within the<br>
first 44 N-terminal amino acids in the sequence of mature GDF-8 (amino acids<br>
1 through 44 of SEQ ID NO:49). Finally, the epitope for Myo28 comprises<br>
residues located within the first 98 N-terminal amino acids of mature GDF-8.<br>
[0137] In order to further characterize the Myo29 epitope, deletion<br>
and substitution analyses were performed using spot synthesis. In the<br>
substitution analysis, each residue of this peptide was individually replaced with<br>
each of the 20 natural amino acids except cysteine. Synthesis and binding<br>
assays were performed as described above. The results are shown in Figure<br>
6, wherein the first row, first two columns and last three columns represent<br>
wild-type peptide controls. The results demonstrate that when Lys-78, Pro-81,<br>
and Asn-83 are each individually mutated to another amino acid, the binding<br>
affinity of Myo29 to the peptide is significantly reduced. Therefore, Myo29<br>
recognizes a sequence comprising Lys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Pro-Xaa3-Asn (SEQ ID<br>
NO:54), wherein Xaa1, Xaa2, and Xaa3 each is either any amino acid, or<br>
Xaa1 = Met, Xaa2 = Ser, and Xaa3 = IIe, independently of each other.<br>
Example 11: Immunoprecipitation of GDF-8<br>
[0138] In order to evaluate the binding of Myo29 and Myo28 to<br>
mature GDF-8 and GDF-8 complexes, an immunoprecipitation study was<br>
conducted. CHO cells expressing GDF-8 were labeled with 35S-methionine and<br>
35S-cysteine. 100 µl conditioned media from these cells, containing GDF-8<br>
protein (mature GDF-8 and latent complex) was incubated with 20 µg/ ml Myo29<br>
or Myo28 for 1 hour at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose™ was added and incubated<br>
overnight at 4°C. The immunoprecipitate was collected, resuspended in<br>
reducing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed,<br>
enhanced with autoradiography enhancer solution, dried, and the autorad was<br>
developed. Figure 7 shows that both Myo29 and Myo28 can<br>
immunoprecipitate mature GDF-8, the GDF-8 latent complex and unprocessed<br>
GDF-8. Both antibodies bind to GDF-8 dimer under non-reducing conditions as<br>
determined by Western blotting.<br>
Example 12: Pharmacokinetics<br>
[0139] The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Myo29 was evaluated in<br>
C57B6/SCID mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg after a single intravenous (IV) or<br>
intraperitoneal (IP) administration. The animals received a mixture of unlabeled<br>
and 125l-labeled Myo29 at the dose listed above and serum concentrations<br>
were determined based on 125l radioactivity in the serum and the specific<br>
activity of the injected dose. Figure 8 shows a plot of serum concentration<br>
versus time for Myo29 administered either IV or IP.<br>
[0140] Myo29 showed a prolonged terminal half-life of around one<br>
week and low clearance around 1 ml/hr/kg. Initial volume of distribution was<br>
about 83 ml/kg. Apparent volume of distribution was about 227 ml/kg. Myo29<br>
reached a peak concentration at about 6 hrs post injection. Fraction absorbed<br>
following IP injection was about 77%.<br>
Example 13: In Vivo Effect of Myo29 on Muscle Mass and Strength<br>
[0141] In order to determine whether Myo29 blocks GDF-8 activity in<br>
vivo, Myo29 was tested in adult SCID mice. SCID mice suffer from a severe<br>
combined immune deficiency, and therefore do not generate an immunological<br>
reaction following injections of human antibodies such as Myo29. Muscle mass<br>
was used as an indicator for GDF-8 activity in mice treated with Myo29.<br>
[0142] Male C57B6 SCID eight weeks old mice were weighed and<br>
evenly distributed with respect to body weight into groups of eight. Myo29 in<br>
PBS buffer was injected into the mice intraperitoneally at various doses (60, 10,<br>
and 1 mg/kg) weekly. A double dose was given the first week.<br>
Vehicle(PBS)-treated or untreated mice were used as controls. The treatments<br>
continued for four weeks. Muscle mass was assessed by dissecting and<br>
weighing the gastrocnemius and quadriceps following treatment. After four<br>
weeks of treatment, muscle mass was increased in all groups treated with<br>
Myo29, ranging from 10% to 23%, with groups treated with higher doses<br>
reaching significant levels (Figure 9, p
[0143] In another experiment, female CB17 SCID mice were treated<br>
with Myo29 weekly at various doses (10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mg/kg) for 4 or 12<br>
weeks. Again, treatments with Myo29 for 4 weeks resulted in an increase in<br>
gastrocnemius and quadriceps weight ranging from 10% to 20% (Figures 10A<br>
and 10B). Longer treatment (12 weeks) resulted in greater increases in muscle<br>
mass (12% to 28%) with all groups treated with Myo29 reaching statistically<br>
significant levels (Figures 11A and 11B).<br>
[0144] In order to determine whether increased muscle mass leads to<br>
stronger muscles, muscle strength of front limb was measured with a grip<br>
strength test meter (model 1027 csx, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH).<br>
After 12 weeks of treatment, the front limb strength was 17% and 23% higher in<br>
mice treated with 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of Myo29 respectively as compared to<br>
the vehicle control (p
that Myo29 inhibits GDF-8 activity in vivo resulting in significant increases in<br>
muscle mass and muscle strength.<br>
Example 14: Treatment of Metabolic Disorders<br>
[0145] Inhibitors of GDF-8, such as, for example inhibitory antibodies,<br>
are useful for treatment of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes,<br>
impaired glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome (e.g., syndrome X), insulin<br>
resistance induced by trauma (e.g., burns or nitrogen imbalance), and adipose<br>
tissue disorders (e.g., obesity). The anti-GDF-8 antibodies of the invention are<br>
used to treat a subject at disease onset or having an established metabolic<br>
disease.<br>
[0146] Efficacy of anti-GDF-8 antibodies for treatment of metabolic<br>
disorders, e.g., type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, is confirmed using well<br>
established murine models of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes,<br>
including ob/ob, db/db, and strains carrying the lethal yellow mutation. Insulin<br>
resistance can also be induced by high fat or high caloric feeding of certain<br>
strains of mice, including C57BL/6J. Similarly to humans, these rodents<br>
develop insulin resistance, hyperinsuliemia, dyslipidemia, and deterioration of<br>
glucose homeostasis resulting in hyperglycemia. Outcome assessments are<br>
based on serum measurements of glucose, insulin and lipids. Measures of<br>
improved insulin sensitivity can be determined by insulin tolerance tests and<br>
glucose tolerance tests. More sensitive techniques would include the use of<br>
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps for assessing improvements is glycemic<br>
control and insulin sensitivity. In addition, the clamp techniques would allow a<br>
quantitative assessment of the role of the major glucose disposing tissues,<br>
(muscle, adipose, and liver), in improved glycemic control.<br>
[0147] In one study, treatment with an anti-GDF-8 antibody such as<br>
Myo29 (IP injection) or vehicle is conducted for one week to six months. The<br>
treatment protocol could vary, with testing of different doses and treatment<br>
regimens (e.g., daily, weekly, or bi-weekly injections). It is anticipated that mice<br>
treated with the anti-GDF-8 antibody would have greater glucose uptake,<br>
increased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis, lower free fatty acids and<br>
triglycerides in the serum as compared to mice receiving placebo treatment.<br>
[0148] The inhibitory antibodies against GDF-8 are also used to<br>
prevent and/or to reduce severity and/or the symptoms of the disease. It is<br>
anticipated that the anti-GDF-8 antibodies would be administered as a<br>
subcutaneous injection as frequently as once per day and as infrequently as<br><br>
once per month. Treatment duration could range from one month to several<br>
years.<br>
[0149] To test the clinical efficacy of anti-GDF-8 in humans, subjects<br>
suffering from or at risk for type 2 diabetes are identified and randomized to a<br>
treatment group. Treatment groups include a placebo group and one to three<br>
groups receiving antibody (different doses). Individuals are followed<br>
prospectively for one month to three years to assess changes in glucose<br>
metabolism. It is anticipated that individuals receiving treatment would exhibit<br>
an improvement.<br>
[0150] The antibodies are administered as the sole active compound<br>
or in combination with another compound or composition. When administered<br>
as the sole active compound or in combination with another compound or<br>
composition, the dosage is preferably from approximately 1 µg/ kg to 20 mg/kg,<br>
depending on the severity of the symptoms and the progression of the disease.<br>
The appropriate effective dose is selected by a treating clinician from the<br>
following ranges: 1 µg/ kg to 20 mg/kg, 1 µg/ kg to 10 mg/kg, 1 µg/ kg to 1 mg/kg,<br>
10 µg/ kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 µg/ kg to 100 µg/ kg, 100 pg to 1 mg/kg, and 500 µg/ kg<br>
to 1 mg/kg. Exemplary treatment regimens and outcomes are summarized in<br>
