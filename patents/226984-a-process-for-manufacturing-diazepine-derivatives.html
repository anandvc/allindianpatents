Process  for manufacturing diazepine  derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing diazepine derivatives of the general formula<br><br>
wherein R1 is lower alkyl and R2 is hydrogen, or R1 and R3 are together -(CH;)n- and n is 2 or 3; R3 is halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and m is 0, 1 or 2; R4 is hydrogen or lower alkyl.<br>
The compounds of general formula I are valuable intermediate products for the manufacture of imidazo[l,5-a][l,4]diazepine derivatives, like for instance 7-chloro-3-(5-dimethylaminomethyl-[ 1,2,4] oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-methyi-4,5-dihydro-imidazo[l,5-a][l,4]benzodiazepin-6-one, which diazepine derivatives show excellent psychopharmacological properties as agonists of the central benzodiazepine receptors.<br>
The compounds of general formula I are obtained by the known process consisting of reacting a compound of general formula<br><br>
wherein R'\ R4 and m have the meaning mentioned above, with a compound of general formula<br><br><br>
wherein R and R" have the meaning mentioned above. This reaction step takes place in a polar solvent such as for instance DMF, under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature between 110°C and the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
The compounds of formula II can be obtained, on their turn, by reacting a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein R and m have the meaning mentioned above,<br>
with:<br>
a)	phosgene and hydrochloric acid in THF; or<br>
b)	ethyl haloformiate, e.g. ethyl chloroformiate, in dioxane and subsequent treatment with acetylchloride.<br>
Both steps take place in a batch system, under atmospheric pressure and at the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture (see e.g. G. M. Coppola, "The Chemistry of Isatoic Anhydride", Synthesis, Georg Thieme Verlag, (1980), pp 505-535).<br>
The last step of the mentioned production pathway is characterised by low yields. This is mainly due to a low conversion of the reactants and, in certain cases, also to a low selectivity towards the desired product because of the formation of a side product of general formula<br><br><br>
These low yield and selectivity imply higher costs for the production of the compounds of formula I and lead to important disposal problems since the compounds of formula V cannot be used for other purposes and must be therefore destroyed or recycled.<br>
The problem at the root of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for manufacturing the compounds of general formula I which can overcome the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
The problem is solved, according to the present invention, by a process for manufacturing diazepine derivatives of the general formula I, comprising the step of reacting a compound of general formula II with a compound of general formula III, characterised in that said compound of general formula II and said compound of general formula III undergo chemical reaction in the absence of a solvent or in the presence of an apolar solvent.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the conversion, and in certain cases also the selectivity, towards the compound of formula I strongly increases if the reaction components (i.e. compounds of formula II and III) are not solvated in the reaction mixture. This situation can take place only if no solvent at all is added to the reaction mixture or if the reactants and/or products are not soluble in a given solvent. Being the present compounds of polar nature, apolar solvents can be used in the process of the invention for achieving the wished results.<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are substituted benzene rings, such as xylenes, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, etc. Most preferably, p-xylene or a mixture of xylenes are used as solvent for carrying out the process according to the present invention.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably set from 0 to 30°C under the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
The process of the present invention is particularly suitable for the manufacture of 6-Chloro-3,4-dihydro-4-methyl-2H-l,4-benzodiazepine-2,5(lH)-dione.<br>
By way of examples, preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described. Comparative tests were made in which the compounds of formulae II and III '   underwent reaction in the conventional manner, i.e. using DMF as (polar) solvent.<br><br>
The yields of compound I (Y(CI)) depicted in Table 1 were measured on the purified product. The ratios of compounds 1 and V depicted in Table 2 (R(CI) and R(CV)) were directly obtained from the HPLC measurements (HP1050, column CC70/4 nucleosil 100-5C18HD), and refer to the molar percentage of CI and CV in the crude product of the reaction.<br>
Y(CI)=100*[molCI/molCII]<br>
