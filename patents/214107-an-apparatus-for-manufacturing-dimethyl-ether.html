				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION METHOD OF MANUFACTURING DIMETHYL ETHER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing dimethyl ether (DME).<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is used as/ for example, a fuel, is very costly.  Specifically, the price of LPG, if delivered to the consuming district, e.g., household, is more than 10 times as high as the import price.  Therefore, dimethyl ether attracts attention as a substitute for LPG in recent years, thus utilization studies are now being carried out.<br>
It is customary to manufacture dimethyl ether in the producing district of a natural gas by using as the raw material a natural gas or methanol synthesized from the natural gas.  The manufactured dimethyl ether is liquefied under a high pressure and the liquefied dimethyl ether is loaded in a high pressure tank or cylinder for transport to the consuming district. Alternatively, the manufactured dimethyl ether is cooled to temperatures lower than -25°C and packed in a freezing tank under atmospheric pressure for transport to the consuming district.<br>
However, dimethyl ether gives rise to the problems transportation and storage costs.  Also, where dimethyl<br>
ether is stored in a high pressure tank, it is necessary to supervise the safety of the high pressure gas in the dimethyl ether producing district. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In the method of the present invention, a liquid methanol that can be handled easily is transported under room temperature and atmospheric pressure from the methanol producing district to the dimethyl ether consuming district, and dimethyl ether is manufactured in the district where it is consumed, which markedly lowers the transport and storage costs, thereby lowering the total cost.<br>
The present invention is also intended to provide a method of manufacturing dimethyl ether, which permits converting the raw material containing methanol into dimethyl ether and also permits converting methanol contained in water separated and discharged from a distillation column into hydrogen and carbon dioxide by utilizing the heat generated in converting the methanol-containing raw material into dimethyl ether so as to effectively utilize the methanol.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing dimethyl ether, comprising transporting a raw material<br>
containing methanol under room temperature and under atmospheric pressure to the dimethyl ether consuming district or its neighboring district, and converting the methanol into dimethyl ether.<br>
Further, according to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing dimethyl ether comprising:<br>
providing a manufacturing apparatus of dimethyl ether including an internal reactor loaded with a catalyst for synthesizing dimethyl ether, an external reactor arranged outside the internal reactor and loaded with a catalyst for decomposing methanol, and a distillation column connected to the internal reactor and the external reactor;<br>

FIG. 2 schematically shows the construction of a methanol distillation column incorporated in the manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 1; and<br>
FIG. 3 schematically shows the construction of a dimethyl ether manufacturing plant used in a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method of the present invention for manufacturing dimethyl ether will now be described in detail.<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
In the first step, methanol is produced in the producing district of a natural gas, such as the Middle or Near East, and transported to the dimethyl ether (DME) consuming district or neighboring district, under room temperature and atmospheric pressure.  The transported methanol is converted into DME in the consuming district of DME.<br>
The consuming district of DME or its neighboring district includes, for example, 1) the district in which is erected a city gas manufacturing plant utilizing DME as a substitute for an LPG for the heat control of the city gas, 2) the site in which is operated a taxi service utilizing DME in place of an LPG as a fuel of a diesel engine vehicle, 3) the site in which is sold DME housed in cylinders as a substitute for LPG, and 4) a household in which DME is utilized as a fuel.<br>
For converting methanol into DME, methanol having a purity of, for example, 100% is used as a raw material, and the reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst for synthesizing DME, such as an alumina series catalyst, under temperatures of 240t to 320°C and under an atmospheric pressure.<br>
DME can be manufactured in a manufacturing plant, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
The manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 1 comprises<br>
a reaction tower 1.  A catalyst loading section 2 is arranged within the reaction tower 1, and a cooling chamber 3 in which is circulated a cooling fluid, e.g., water, is arranged to surround the outer surface of the reaction tower 1.  A water supply passageway 4 is connected to a region in the vicinity of the bottom portion of the cooling chamber 3.  On the other hand, a steam discharge passageway 5 is connected to an upper portion of the cooling chamber 3.<br>
A raw material supply passageway 6 is connected to the bottom portion of the reaction tower 1.  Also, a heat exchanger 7 is mounted to the raw material supply passageway 6.<br>
A DME distillation column 8 is connected to the reaction tower 1 via a fluid passageway 9 connected to the upper portion of the reaction tower 1.  The fluid passageway 9 extends to cross the heat exchanger 7. Further, a cooling device 10 is mounted to the fluid passageway 9.<br>
The method of manufacturing DME will now be described with reference to the manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In the first step, methanol having a purity of, for example, 100%, which is heated to 240 to 320t:, is supplied into the reaction tower 1 through the raw material supply passageway 6, and DME is synthesized in the presence of a catalyst for synthesizing DME loaded<br>
in the loading section 2.  The synthesizing reaction of DME is an exothermic reaction and, thus, it is possible to obtain a hot water or steam from the steam discharge passageway 5 by supplying water into the cooling chamber 3 through the water supply passageway 4.<br>
The reaction mixture containing DME is supplied into the DME distillation column 8 through the fluid passageway 9.  When the reaction mixture is circulated through the fluid passageway 9, a heat exchange is performed in the heat exchanger 7 between the reaction mixture and the raw material circulated through the raw material supply passageway 6, with the result that the reaction mixture is cooled and the raw material is heated.  Further, the reaction mixture is cooled in the cooling device 10 and, then, supplied into the DME distillation column 8.  The reaction mixture supplied into the DME distillation column 8 is separated into DME and water containing methanol.  The separated DME is discharged from the top of the distillation column 8 through a fluid passageway 11.  On the other hand, the separated water containing methanol is discharged from the bottom portion of the distillation column 8 through a fluid passageway 12.<br>
Incidentally, it is possible to add a methanol distillation column 13 shown in FIG. 2 to the manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 1.<br>
To be more specific, two loading members (or<br>
trays) 14a and 14b are arranged separately from each other in the vertical direction inside the methanol distillation column 13.  A circulation passageway 15 is connected at one end to the bottom portion of the methanol distillation column 13 and at the other end to that portion of the methanol distillation column 13 which is positioned below the lower loading member 14b. A pump 16 and a heat exchanger 17 are mounted to the circulation passageway 15 in the order mentioned as viewed from the side of the bottom portion of the methanol distillation column 13.  Also, a branched passageway 20 is branched from the circulation passageway 15, and a valve 18 and a cooling device 19 are mounted to the branched passageway 20.<br>
The top portion of the methanol distillation column 13 is joined to a gas-liquid separator 21 via a fluid passageway 22, and a cooling device 23 is mounted to the fluid passageway 22.  The gas-liquid separator 21 is joined to the upper side wall of the methanol distillation column 13 via a returning fluid passageway 24.  Further, a fluid passageway 25 for discharging methanol and DME is connected to the gas-liquid separator 21.<br>
The fluid passageway 11 for discharging DME, which is shown in FIG. 1, is connected to that portion of the methanol distillation column 13 which is positioned below the lower loading member 14b.  Also, the fluid<br>
passageway 12 for discharging water containing methanol, which is shown in FIG. 1, is connected to that portion of the methanol distillation column 13 which is positioned between the upper and lower loading members 14a and 14b.<br>
In the system shown in FIG. 2, DME and water containing methanol are supplied through the fluid passageways 11 and 12, respectively, into the methanol distillation column 13, with the valve 18 that is mounted to the branched passageway 20 closed.  At the same time, the pump 18 is driven and, for example, steam is supplied into the heat exchanger 17 so as to heat the bottom portion of the distillation column 13. In this case, the DME supplied through the fluid passageway 11 is heated in the bottom portion of the methanol distillation column 13 so as to be moved upward within the distillation column 13.  On the other hand, the methanol containing water, which is supplied through the fluid passageway 12, is stripped in the lower loading member 14b and the upper loading member 14a.  By this stripping, methanol is distilled and, at the same time, the water containing undistilled methanol is stored in the bottom portion of the distillation column 13.  The water containing the undistilled methanol, which is stored in the bottom portion of the distillation column 13, is circulated through the circulation passageway 15 by the driving of<br>
the pump 16.  During the circulation, the water containing the undistilled methanol is heated in the heat exchanger 17 so as to distill methanol in the bottom portion of the distillation column 13.<br>
Methanol containing steam and DME are circulated through the fluid passageway 22 connected to the top portion of the distillation column 13.  During the circulation, methanol containing steam and DME are cooled by the cooling device 23 and, then, supplied into the gas-liquid separator 21.  In the gas-liquid separator 21, methanol containing steam and DME are separated into methanol, DME and water.  The separated methanol and DME are discharged and recovered through the fluid passageway 25, and the separated water is returned to the distillation column 13 through the returning fluid passageway 24.<br>
In the distilling operation described above, the heated water stored in the bottom portion of the distillation column 13, the methanol content of said heated water being substantially zero, is discharged to the outside through the branched passageway 20 by opening the valve 18 and, then, cooled in the cooling device 19 mounted to the branched passageway 20.<br>
Incidentally, when methanol transported in the first embodiment described above is converted into DME in the consuming district of DME, the conversion can be performed by the method according to second embodiment<br>
of the present invention described herein later.<br>
According to the first embodiment of the present invention described above, methanol is transported under room temperature and atmospheric pressure from the dimethyl ether producing district to the consuming district, or its neighboring district, and the transported methanol is converted into DME in the consuming district.  The particular method of the present invention is markedly advantageous in terms of transportation cost, over the conventional method in which DME is manufactured in the methanol producing district, then the manufactured DME is liquefied under a high pressure and the liquefied DME is housed in a high pressure tank or cylinder for transportation to the DME consuming district, or the manufactured DME is cooled to temperatures not higher than -2b°C and housed in a refrigeration tank under atmospheric pressure for transportation to the consuming district.  As a result, the present invention produces prominent effects as summarized below:<br>
1)	It is possible for the owner of a city gas<br>
manufacturing plant using DME as a substitute for an<br>
LPG for the heat control of a city gas to manufacture a<br>
city gas at a low cost.<br>
2)	In the taxi service operation using DME in<br>
place of an LPG as a fuel for a diesel engine vehicle,<br>
it is possible to provide a fuel for the diesel engine<br>
vehicle at a low cost.<br>
3)	In the selling business of a fuel, in which<br>
DME is housed in a gas cylinder as a substitute for<br>
LPG, it is possible to sell the DME at a low cost.<br>
4)	In households that use DME, it can be used as<br>
a low cost fuel.<br>
By using the manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 1 for the operation to convert the raw material containing methanol into DME, this can be done in the reaction tower 1.  At the same time, it is possible to obtain a hot water and steam by supplying water into the cooling chamber 3 arranged to surround the reaction tower 1 so heat it is heated by the exothermic reaction carried out within the reaction tower 1.<br>
Further, it is possible to recover methanol and to discharge water whose methanol content is substantially zero by adding the methanol distillation column 13 shown in FIG. 2 to the manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 1.  Specifically, DME separated in the DME distillation column 8 is supplied into the middle portion of the methanol distillation column 13 through the fluid passageway 11, and the water containing methanol is supplied to the lower portion of the methanol distillation column 13 through the fluid passageway 12.  At the same time, the lower portion of the distillation column 13 is heated so as to strip the water containing methanol so as to recover methanol and<br>
discharge the water whose methanol content is substantially zero.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 3 schematically shows the construction of a dimethyl ether manufacturing plant used in the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in the drawing, the dimethyl ether manufacturing plant includes a cylindrical internal reactor 31.  A loading section 32 of a DME synthesizing catalyst, such as an alumina series catalyst, is arranged within the internal reactor 31, and an annular external reactor 34 including a loading section 33 of a methanol reforming catalyst, such as a copper-based catalyst, is arranged to surround the outer surface of the internal reactor 31.<br>
A raw material supply passageway 35 is connected to the bottom portion of the internal reactor 31. First and second heat exchangers 36, 37 are mounted to the raw material supply passageway 35.<br>
A DME distillation column 38 is connected to the internal reactor 31 through a fluid passageway 39]_ connected to the upper portion of the internal reactor 31.  The fluid passageway 39^ extends to cross the first heat exchanger 36.  A cooling device 40 is mounted to the fluid passageway 39^.  The bottom portion of the distillation column 38 is connected to the external reactor 34 through a fluid passageway 392 <br>
A pump 41 is mounted to the fluid passageway 392 in tne vicinity of the distillation column 38.  Also, the fluid passageway 392 extends to cross the second heat exchanger 37.<br>
A branched raw material supply passageway 42 is branched from the raw material supply passageway 35 so as to be connected to the fluid passageway 392-Further, a discharge passageway 44 having a cooling device 43 mounted thereto is connected to the external reactor 34.<br>
The method of manufacturing DME by using the manufacturing plant shown in FIG. 3 will now be described.<br>
In the first step, the raw material heated to 240 to 320t, e.g., methanol having a purity of 100%, is supplied into the internal reactor 31 through the raw material supply passageway 35.  As a result, DME is synthesized in the presence of a DME synthesizing catalyst such as an alumina-based catalyst in the loading section 32.  The reaction to synthesize DME is an exothermic reaction.<br>
The reaction mixture containing DME is supplied into the DME distillation column 38 through the fluid passageway 39^.  While passing through the fluid passageway 39^, the reaction mixture exchanges heat within the first heat exchanger 36 with the raw material passing through the raw material supply<br><br>
passageway 35, with the result that the reaction mixture is cooled, and the raw material is heated.  The reaction mixture is further cooled in the cooling device 40 and, then, supplied into the distillation column 38.  The reaction mixture supplied into the distillation column 38 is separated into DME and water containing methanol.  The separated DME is discharged from the top portion of the distillation column 38 so as to be recovered.<br>
On the other hand, the water containing methanol is supplied by the driving of the pump 41 from the bottom portion of the distillation column 38 into the annular external reactor 34 through the fluid passageway 392-  While passing through the fluid passageway 392, the water containing methanol exchanges heat within the second heat exchanger 37 with the raw material passing through the raw material supply passageway 35, with the result that the water is heated and the raw material is cooled.  The methanol contained in the water supplied into the external reactor 34 is reformed in the presence of the methanol reforming catalyst in the loading section 33 so as to generate hydrogen and carbon dioxide.  It should be noted that the methanol reforming reaction is an endothermic reaction, and the DME synthesizing reaction is an exothermic reaction.  It follows that it is possible to maintain a good heat balance during the reactions so as<br>
to effectively utilize the heat.<br>
Where the amount of methanol in the bottom portion of the distillation column 38 is small in the methanol reforming reaction described above, the raw material methanol is introduced from the raw material supply passageway 35 into the fluid passageway 392, through which flows water containing methanol, via the branched raw material supply passageway 42.<br>
The hydrogen and carbon dioxide formed in the external reactor 34 are discharged and recovered through the discharge passageway 44 having the cooling device mounted thereto.<br>
As described above, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the raw material containing methanol can be converted into DME, and the methanol contained in the water separated in and discharged from the distillation column can be effectively utilized.<br>
To be more specific, in the general manufacturing process of dimethyl ether, methanol heated to 240°C to 320°C is supplied into a reaction tower, and DME is synthesized in the presence of a DME synthesizing catalyst such as an alumina-based catalyst in the loading section.  As described previously, the reaction to synthesize DME is an exothermic reaction.  The reaction mixture containing DME is cooled and, then, supplied into the DME distillation column so as to be<br>
separated into DME and water containing methanol.  The separated DME is discharged from the top portion of the distillation column so as to be recovered, and the water containing methanol is discharged from the bottom portion of the distillation column.<br>
When it comes to the conventional manufacturing process of dimethyl ether, the water discharged from the bottom portion of the DME distillation column certainly contains methanol.  However, methanol contained in the discharged water is not effectively utilized but is discarded.<br>
Under the circumstances, in the second embodiment of the present invention, the raw material containing methanol can be converted into DME within the internal reactor 31.  At the same time, the methanol-containing water separated from the DME distillation column 38 is supplied into the annular external reactor 34 surrounding the internal reactor 31 so as to decompose methanol by utilizing the heat generated within the internal reactor 31 (exothermic reaction) and the methanol decomposing catalyst loaded in the external reactor 34, thereby obtaining mainly hydrogen.  It follows that the raw material containing methanol can be converted into DME, and the methanol contained in the water separated in and discharged from the distillation column 38 can be effectively utilized.<br>
It should also be noted that the raw material<br>
methanol used in the methanol decomposing reaction can be introduced from the raw material supply passageway 35 into the fluid passageway 392, through which flows the methanol-containing water, via the branched raw material supply passageway 42.  It follows that, even where the amount of methanol in the bottom portion of the distillation column 38 is small, it is possible to decompose methanol effectively so as to obtain hydrogen with a high stability.<br>
Incidentally, in the second embodiment described above, the reactor loaded with a DME synthesizing catalyst is arranged inside, and the reactor loaded with a methanol decomposing catalyst is arranged outside.  However, it is possible to reverse the positional relationship between these two reactors.<br>
As described above in detail, the method of the present invention for manufacturing dimethyl ether makes it possible to transport methanol, which is liquid under room temperature and atmospheric pressure and, thus, can be handled easily, from the methanol producing district to the consuming district of dimethyl ether for manufacturing dimethyl ether in the consuming district.  It follows that the transporting cost and the storing cost can be markedly lowered so as to make it possible to supply dimethyl ether of a low cost to, for example, the owner of a city gas manufacturing plant, the taxi service operator, the<br>
seller of dimethyl ether as a substitute for an LPG, and the household.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of manufacturing dimethyl ether, which makes it possible to convert the raw material containing methanol into dimethyl ether and to convert the methanol contained in the water separated in and discharged from the distillation column into hydrogen by utilizing the heat generated from the reaction to synthesize dimethyl ether.<br>
Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.  Therefore, the present invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.
