				<td>The present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The present invention relates to novel 2,4,6-phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use as pesticides and/or herbicides.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to novel selective herbicidal active compound combinations comprising firstly the 2,4,6-phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols and secondly at least one compound which improves crop plant tolerance, which combinations can be used with particularly good results for the selective control of weeds in various crops of useful plants.<br>
Pharmaceutical properties of 3-acylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones have already been described (S. Suzuki et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 15 1120 (1967)). Furthermore, N-phenylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones were synthesized by R. Schmierer and H. Mildenberger (Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985, 1095). A biological activity of these compounds has not been described.<br>
EP-A-0 262 399 and GB-A-2 266 888 disclose compounds of a similar structure (3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones), of which, however, no herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action has been disclosed. Unsubstituted, bicyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599, EP-A-415 211 and JP-A-12-053670) and substituted monocyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) having herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action have been disclosed.<br>
There have also been disclosed polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and 1H-arylpyrrolidinedione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521 334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997, WO 95/26 954, WO 95/20 572, EP-A-0 668 267, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 97/43275, WO 98/05638, WO 98/06721, WO 98/25928, WO 99/16748, WO 99/24437, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673, WO 01/17972, WO 01/23354, WO 01/74770, WO 03/062244, WO 04/024688, WO 04/007448, WO 04/080962, WO 04/065366, DE-A-10326386).<br>
It is known that certain substituted 3-dihydrofuran-2-one derivatives have herbicidal properties (cf. DE-A-4 014 420). The synthesis of the tetronic acid derivatives used as starting materials (such as, for example, 3-(2-methylphenyl)-4-hydroxy-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-A3-dihydrofuran-2-one) is also described in DE-A-4 014 420. Compounds of a similar structure are known from the publication Campbell et al., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, 1985, (8) 1567-76, but no insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity is mentioned. 3-Aryl-3-dihydrofuranone derivatives having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are also known from EP-A-528 156, EP-A-0 647 637, WO 95/26 345, WO 96/20 196, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36868, WO 98/05638, WO 98/25928, WO 99/16748, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO<br>
99/55673, WO 01/17972, WO 01/23354, WO 01/74770, WO 03/062244, WO 04/024688, WO<br>
04/080962, DE-A-10326386. 3-Aryl-A3-dihydrothiophenone derivatives are likewise known (WO<br>
95/26345, 96/25395, WO 97/01535, WO 97/02243, WO 97/36868, WO 98/05638, WO<br>

01/23354, WO 01/74770, WO 03/062244, WO 04/080962, DE-A-10326386).<br>
Certain phenylpyrone derivatives which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring are already known (cf.<br>
A.M. Chirazi, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, Arch. Pharm. 309, 558 (1976) and K.-H. Boltze and<br>
K. Heidenbluth, Chem. Ber. 9.1, 2849), but a possible use of these compounds as pesticides has not<br>
been mentioned. Phenylpyrone derivatives which are substituted in the phenyl ring and have<br>
herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are described in EP-A-588 137, WO 96/25 395,<br>
WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/16 436, WO 97/19 941, WO 97/36 868,<br>

Certain 5-phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring are already<br>
known (cf. E. Ziegler and E. Steiner, Monatsh. 95, 147 (1964), R. Ketcham, T. Kappe and<br>
E. Ziegler, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 10, 223 (1973)), but a possible use of these compounds as<br>
pesticides has not been mentioned. 5-Phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives which are substituted in the<br>
phenyl ring and have herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal action are described in WO 94/14 785,<br>
WO 96/02 539, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868,<br>

WO 03/062244, WO 04/080962, DE-A-10326386.<br>
It is known that certain substituted 2-arylcyclopentanediones have herbicidal, insecticidal and<br>
acaricidal properties (cf., for example, US-4 283 348; 4 338 122; 4 436 666; 4 526 723; 4 551 547;<br>
4 632 698; WO 96/01 798; WO 96/03 366, WO 97/14 667 and also WO 98/39281, WO 99/43649,<br>
WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673, WO 01/17972, WO 01/74770, WO 03/062244, WO 04/080962,<br>
DE-A-10326386). Moreover, compounds having similar substitutions are known; 3-hydroxy-5,5-<br>
dimethyl-2-phenylcyclopent-2-en-l-one from the publication Micklefield et al., Tetrahedron,<br>
(1992), 7519-26, and the natural product involutin (-)-cis-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydroxy-<br>
2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclopent-2-enone from the publication Edwards et al., J. Chem. Soc. S,<br>
(1967), 405-9. An insecticidal or acaricidal action is not described. Moreover, 2-(2,4,6-<br>
trimethylphenyl)-l,3-indanedione is known from the publication J. Economic Entomology, 66,<br>
(1973), 584 and the Offenlegungsschrift (German Published Specification) DE-A 2 361 084, with<br>
herbicidal and acaricidal actions being mentioned.<br>
It is known that certain substituted 2-arylcyclohexanediones have herbicidal, insecticidal and<br>
acaricidal properties (US-4 175 135, 4209432, 4256657, 4256658, 4256659, 4257858,<br>
4 283 348, 4 303 669, 4 351 666, 4 409 153, 4 436 666, 4 526 723, 4 613 617, 4 659 372, DE-A<br>
2 813 341, and also Wheeler, T.N., J. Org. Chem. 44, 4906 (1979)), WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869,<br>
WO 99/55673, WO 01/17972, WO 01/74770, WO 03/062244, WO 04/080962, DE-A-10326386).<br>
It is known that certain substituted 4-arylpyrazolidine-3,5-diones have acaricidal, insecticidal and<br>
herbicidal properties (cf., for example, WO 92/16510, EP-A-508 126, WO 96/11574, WO<br>
96/21 652, WO 99/47525, WO 01/17351, WO 01/17 352, WO 01/17353, WO 01/17 972, WO<br>

However, the activity and/or activity spectrum of these compounds is, in particular at low<br>
application rates and concentrations, not always entirely satisfactory. Furthermore, these<br>
compounds are not always sufficiently well tolerated by plants.<br>

Depending inter alia on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be<br>
present as geometrical and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures of varying composition which, if<br>
appropriate, can be separated in a customary manner. The present invention provides both the pure<br>
isomers and the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use and compositions comprising them.<br>
However, for the sake of simplicity, hereinbelow only compounds of the formula (1) are referred<br>
to, although what is meant is both the pure compounds and, if appropriate, mixtures having various<br>
proportions of isomeric compounds.<br>

The compounds of the formulae (I-8-A) and (I-8-B) can be present both as mixtures and in the<br>
form of their pure isomers. Mixtures of the compounds of the formulae (I-8-A) and (I-8-B) can, if<br>
appropriate, be separated in a manner known per se by physical methods, for example by<br>
chromatographic methods.<br>
For reasons of clarity, hereinbelow only one of the possible isomers is shown in each case. This<br>
does not exclude that the compounds may, if appropriate, be present in the form of the isomer<br>
mixtures or in the respective other isomeric form.<br>

Surprisingly, it has now been found that the above-defined active compound combinations of<br>
substituted ketoenols of the general formula (I) and safeners (antidotes) from the above group (b') are<br>
not only very well tolerated by useful plants, but also have a particularly high herbicidal activity and<br>
can be used in a variety of crops, in particular in cereals (mainly wheat), but also in soybeans,<br>
potatoes, maize and rice, for the selective control of weeds.<br>
It must be considered as surprising that, from a multiplicity of known safeners or antidotes which are<br>
capable of antagonizing the damaging effect of a herbicide on the crop plants, it is precisely the<br>
abovementioned compounds of group (b') which are capable of virtually completely compensating<br>
for the harmful effect of substituted cyclic ketoenols of the formula (I) on the crop plants without<br>
adversely affecting the herbicidal activity towards the weeds to a substantial degree.<br>
What must be emphasized in this context is the particularly advantageous activity of the particularly<br>
and most preferred combination partners from group (b'), in particular with regard to leaving cereal<br>
plants, such as, for example, wheat, barley and rye, but also maize and rice, as crop plants unharmed.<br>

If appropriate, the compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention may<br>
also be used in certain concentrations or application rates to act as herbicides. If appropriate, they<br>
can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be<br>
understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and<br>
undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be<br>
plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by<br>
biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the<br>
transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant<br>
breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above<br>
and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned<br>
being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes.<br>
The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation<br>
material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds or<br>
active compound combinations is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by<br>
immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on or injection and, in the case of<br>
propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be converted into the customary<br>
formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes,<br>
soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials<br>
impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds<br>
with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants,<br>
that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as cosolvents.<br>
The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or<br>
alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols<br>
such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk,<br>
quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as<br>
highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example<br>
crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or<br>
else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as<br>
sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers<br>
are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates,<br>
alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example<br>
lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else<br>
natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in<br>
the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide<br>
and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants such as alizarin colorants, azo colorants and metal<br>
phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper,<br>
cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound,<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations, can also be<br>
used as a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, for<br>
example in order to widen the spectrum of action or to prevent the development of resistances in<br>
this way. In many cases, synergistic effects result, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the<br>
activity of the individual components.<br>

185984-60-5) (cf. WO 96/37494, WO 98/25923),<br>
and preparations which contain insecticidally active plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth<br>
regulators is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared<br>
with these formulations, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore exist in the<br>
form of a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds by which the activity of the active<br>
compounds is increased without it being necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available<br>
formulations can vary within broad ranges. The active compound concentration of the use forms can<br>
be from 0.0000001 up to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by<br>
weight.<br>
They are applied in a customary manner adapted to suit the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound or active<br>
compound combination is distinguished by excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as<br>
good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants or their parts in accordance with the<br>
invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species or plant varieties and plant cultivars which<br>
have been obtained by traditional biological breeding methods, such as hybridization or protoplast<br>
fusion, and the parts of these varieties and cultivars are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
transgenic plants and plant cultivars which have been obtained by recombinant methods, if<br>
appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and their<br>
parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Plants which are treated particularly preferably in accordance with the invention are those of the plant<br>
cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use. Plant cultivars are understood as<br>
meaning plants with new traits which have been bred either by conventional breeding, by<br>
mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may take the form of cultivars, biotypes and<br>
genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate,<br>
vegetation period, nutrition), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive<br>
("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widened activity<br>
spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used in<br>
accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to salinity in the water or soil, increased flowering performance,<br>
facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, higher quality and/or better nutritional<br>
value of the harvested products, better storage characteristics and/or processability of the harvested<br>
products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by recombinant methods) to be<br>
treated in accordance with the invention include all those plants which, owing to the process of<br>
recombinant modification, were given genetic material which confers particular, advantageous,<br>
valuable traits to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased<br>
tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to salinity in the water or<br>
soil, increased flowering performance, facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields,<br>
higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage characteristics<br>
and/or better processability of the harvested products. Further examples of such traits, examples<br>
which must be mentioned especially, are better defence of the plants against animal and microbial<br>
pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses and an increased<br>
tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which<br>
may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soybeans,<br>
potato, cotton, oilseed rape, beet, sugar cane and fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits<br>
and grapes), with particular emphasis on maize, soybeans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits<br>
which are especially emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against insects, owing to<br>
toxins being formed in the plants, in particular toxins which are generated in the plants by the genetic<br>
material of Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryEIA,<br>
CrylUA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, CrySBb and CrylF and their combinations; hereinbelow "Bt<br>
plants"). Other traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased defence of plants against<br>
fungi, bacteria and viruses by the systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins,<br>
elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Other traits which<br>
are especially emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active<br>
compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example<br>
"PAT" gene). The genes which confer the desired traits in each case may also be present in the<br>
transgenic plants in combination with one another. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned<br>
are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars, soybean cultivars and potato cultivars which are commercially<br>
available under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soybeans), KnockOut®<br>
(for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and<br>
NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize<br>
cultivars, cotton cultivars and soybean cultivars which are commercially available under the trade<br>
names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soybean), Liberty<br>
Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), DVfl® (tolerance to imidazolinones)<br>
and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in<br>
a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include also the varieties<br>
commercially available under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Naturally, these statements<br>
also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which<br>
plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously with the compounds according to the<br>
invention or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated<br>
above for the active compounds and mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular<br>
emphasis may be given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically<br>
mentioned in the present text.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention are not only<br>
active against plant, hygiene and stored-product pests, but also, in the veterinary medicine sector,<br>
against animal parasites (ectoparasites), such as ixodid ticks, argasid ticks, scab mites, trombi-culid<br>
mites, flies (stinging and sucking), parasitic fly larvae, lice, hair lice, bird lice and fleas. These<br>
parasites include:<br>
From the order of the Anoplurida, for example, Haematopinus spp., Linognathus spp., Pediculus spp.,<br>
Phtirus spp., Solenopotes spp..<br>
From the order of the Mallophagida and the sub-orders Amblycerina and Ischnocerina, for example,<br>

The active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention are also<br>
suitable for controlling arthropods which attack agricultural livestock, such as, for example, cattle,<br>
sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffaloes, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese,<br>
honeybees, other domestic animals, such as, for example, dogs, cats, cage birds, aquarium fish, and<br>
so-called experimental animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea-pigs, rats and mice. By<br>
combating these arthropods, it is intended to reduce deaths and decreased performances (in meat,<br>
milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey and the like), so that more economical and simpler animal keeping<br>
is made possible by using the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
In the veterinary sector, the active compounds or active compound combinations according to the<br>
invention are used in a known manner by enteral administration, for example in the form of tablets,<br>
capsules, drinks, drenches, granules, pastes, boli, the feed-through method, suppositories, by<br>
parenteral administration, such as, for example, by means of injections (intramuscular,<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal application, by dermal<br>
administration, for example in the form of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring-on and spottingon,<br>
washing, dusting, and with the aid of shaped articles which comprise active compound, such as<br>
collars, ear tags, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When administered to livestock, poultry, domestic animals and the like, the active compounds or<br>
active compound combinations can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions,<br>
flowables) which comprise the active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, either<br>
directly or after dilution by a factor of 100 to 10 000, or they may be used in the form of a<br>
chemical bath.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the compounds or active compound combinations according to<br>
the invention have a potent insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>
The following insects may be mentioned by way of example and as being preferred, but without<br>
any limitation:<br>
Beetles, such as<br>

Industrial materials are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials,<br>
such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and timber<br>
products, and paint. The materials to be very particularly preferably protected against attack by<br>
insects are wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention<br>
or mixtures comprising such a composition are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles,<br>
boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood cladding, windows and doors made of wood,<br>
plywood, particle board, joiner's articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the<br>
construction of houses or in joinery.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of<br>
concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions,<br>
suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or<br>
fixative, water repellent, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, colorants<br>
and pigments and other processing auxiliaries. The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used<br>
for the protection of wood and wooden materials comprise the active compound according to the<br>
invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the<br>
occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum rate of application can be determined<br>
upon use in each case by a test series. However, in general, it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by<br>
weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be<br>
protected.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or<br>
oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical<br>
solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents having an<br>
evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C.<br>
Substances which are used as such oily and oil-type solvents which have low volatility and are<br>
insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing<br>
solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C,<br>
white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C,<br>
petroleum or aromatics of boiling range 160 to 280°C, essence of terpentine and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210°C or<br>
high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220°C<br>
and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility having an evaporation number of above 35<br>
and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be partially replaced by<br>
organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture<br>
also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above<br>
45 °C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an<br>
aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Substances which are preferably used<br>
are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as,<br>
for example, glycol ethers, esters and the like.<br>
The organochemical binders used within the scope of the present invention are the synthetic resins<br>
and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble<br>
or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders<br>
composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or<br>
modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/cumarone resin, silicone<br>
resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural<br>
and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or<br>
solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders. In<br>
addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odour-masking substances and inhibitors or<br>
anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed.<br>
The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least<br>
one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder.<br>
Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by<br>
weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
All or some of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer<br>
(mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and<br>
crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100%<br>
of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate,<br>
dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, the<br>
adipic esters, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate,<br>
the oleates, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molecular-weight glycol<br>
ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl<br>
ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Particularly suitable as a solvent or diluent is also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or<br>
more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by large-scale industrial impregnation<br>
processes, for example vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions can additionally comprise other insecticides and, if<br>
appropriate, additionally one or more fungicides.<br>
Suitable additional components which may be admixed are, preferably, the insecticides and<br>
fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in that document are expressly<br>
part of the present application.<br>
Very particularly preferred components which may be admixed are insecticides, such as<br>
chlorpyriphos, phoxim, silafluofin, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin,<br>
permethrin, imidacloprid, NI-25, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron, transfluthrin, thiacloprid,<br>

carbamate, N-octylisothiazolin-3-one and 4,5-dichloro-N-octylisothiazolin-3-one.<br>
The compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention can at the same time<br>
be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with salt water or brackish water, in<br>
particular hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the<br>
Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species<br>
from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases<br>
the frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs<br>
owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile<br>
Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of<br>
particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention, alone or in<br>
combination with other active compounds, have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>
Using the compounds according to the invention, alone or in combination with other active<br>
compounds, allows the use of heavy metals such as, for example, in bis(trialkyltin) sulphides, tri-nbutyltin<br>
laurate, tri-tt-butyltin chloride, copper(I) oxide, triethyltin chloride, tri-«-butyl-(2-phenyl-<br>
4-chlorophenoxy)tin, tributyltin oxide, molybdenum disulphide, antimony oxide, polymeric butyl<br>

If appropriate, paints also comprise inorganic pigments, organic pigments or colorants which are<br>
preferably insoluble in salt water. Paints may furthermore comprise materials such as rosin to<br>
allow controlled release of the active compounds. Furthermore, the paints may comprise<br>
plasticizers, modifiers which affect the rheological properties and other conventional constituents.<br>
The compounds according to the invention or the abovementioned mixtures may also be<br>
incorporated into self-polishing antifouling systems.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations are also suitable for controlling animal<br>
pests, in particular insects, arachnids and mites, which are found in enclosed spaces such as, for<br>
example, dwellings, factory halls, offices, vehicle cabins and the like. They can be employed in<br>

The active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention can also be<br>
used as defoliants, desiccants, haulm killers and, in particular, as weed killers. Weeds in the<br>
broadest sense are understood as meaning all plants which grow at locations where they are<br>
undesired. Whether the substances according to the invention act as nonselective or selective<br>
herbicides depends essentially on the application rate.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention can be used<br>

However, the use of the active compounds or active compound combinations according to the<br>
invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds or active compound combinations<br>
according to the invention are suitable for the nonselective weed control on, for example,<br>
industrial terrains and railway tracks and on paths and locations with and without trees. Likewise<br>
the active compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in<br>
perennial crops, for example forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves,<br>
nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm<br>
plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantations and hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland,<br>
and for the selective control of weeds in annual crops.<br>
The compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention have strong<br>
herbicidal activity and a broad activity spectrum when used on the soil and on aerial plant parts.<br>
To a certain extent, they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and<br>
dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both pre- and postemergence.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds or active compound<br>
combinations according to the invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and<br>
fungal or bacterial plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or<br>
precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be converted into the customary<br>
formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents,<br>
pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials<br>
impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds<br>
with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that<br>
is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary<br>
solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes,<br>
chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes,<br>
chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for<br>
example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol, and also<br>
their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or<br>
cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and<br>
also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins,<br>
clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic<br>
minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates, suitable solid carriers for granules are:<br>
for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and<br>
dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic<br>
material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or<br>
foam-formers are: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid<br>
esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers,<br>
alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are:<br>
for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and also<br>
natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the<br>
formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and<br>
Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine<br>
dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt,<br>
molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound,<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations, can also be<br>
used for weed control purposes as a mixture with known herbicides and/or with substances which<br>
improve crop plant tolerance ("safeners"), ready mixes or tank mixes being possible. Mixtures<br>
with herbicide products which contain one or more known herbicides and a safener are hence also<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insectides, acaricides,<br>
nematicides, bird repellents, plant nutrients and soil conditioners, is also possible.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be applied as such, in the form of<br>
their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use<br>
solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are applied in the<br>
customary manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, spreading.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied<br>
both before and after plant emergence. They can also be incorporated into the soil prior to<br>
planting.<br>
The application rate of active compound can vary within a substantial range. Essentially, it<br>
depends on the nature of the desired effect. In general, the application rates are between 1 g and<br>
10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil area, preferably between 5 g and 5 kg per ha.<br>
The advantageous effect of the compatibility with crop plants of the active compound<br>
combinations according to the invention is particularly pronounced at certain concentration ratios.<br>
However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be<br>
varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, from 0.001 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably<br>
from 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, of one of the<br>
compounds which improves crop plant compatibility (antidotes/safeners) mentioned above under<br>
(b1) are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are generally applied in the form of<br>
finished formulations. However, the active compounds contained in the active compound<br>
combinations can, as individual formulations, also be mixed during use, i.e. be applied in the form<br>
of tank mixes.<br>
For certain applications, in particular by the post-emergence method, it may furthermore be<br>
advantageous to include, as further additive in the formulations, mineral or vegetable oils which<br>
are tolerated by plants (for example commercial preparation "Rako Binol"), or ammonium salts,<br>
such as, for example, ammonium sulphate or ammonium thiocyanate.<br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or<br>
the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. Application is in the customary manner, for example by<br>
watering, spraying, atomizing, dusting or scattering.<br>
The application rates of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be<br>
varied within a certain range; they depend, inter alia, on the weather and on soil factors. In general,<br>
the application rates are between 0.001 and 5 kg per ha, preferably between 0.005 and 2 kg per ha,<br>
particularly preferably between 0.01 and 0.5 kg per ha.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied before and after<br>
emergence of the plants, that is to say by the pre-emergence and post-emergence method.<br>
Depending on their properties, the safeners to be used according to the invention can be used for<br>
pretreating the seed of the crop plant (seed dressing) or can be introduced into the seed furrows<br>
prior to sowing or be used separately prior to the herbicide or together with the herbicide, before or<br>
after emergence of the plants.<br>
Examples of plants which may be mentioned are important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat,<br>
rice), maize, soybeans, potatoes, cotton, oil seed rape, beet, sugar cane and also fruit plants (with<br>
the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), greater emphasis being given to maize,<br>
soybeans, potatoes, cotton and oil seed rape.<br>

Example F<br>
1. Herbicidal pre-emergence action<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam<br>
in wood fibre pots and covered with soil. The test compounds, formulated in the form of wettable<br>
powders (WP), are then, in various dosages as aqueous suspension with a water application rate of<br>
600 1/ha (converted), with 0.2% of wetting agent added, applied to the surface of the covering soil.<br>
After the treatment, the pots are placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for<br>
the test plants. The visual assessment of the emergence damage on the test plants is carried out<br>
after a trial period of 3 weeks by comparison with untreated controls (herbicidal effect in per cent<br>
(%):100% effect = the plants have died, 0% effect = like control plants).<br>
2. Herbicidal post-emergence action<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam<br>
in wood fibre pots, covered with soil and cultivated in a greenhouse under good growth conditions.<br>
2-3 weeks after sowing, the test plants are treated at the one-leaf stage. The test compounds,<br>
formulated as wettable powders (WP), are, in various dosages with a water application rate of<br>
600 1/ha (converted), with 0.2% of wetting agent added, sprayed onto the green parts of the plants.<br>
After the test plants were kept in the greenhouse under optimum growth conditions for about 3<br>
weeks, the effect of the preparations is rated visually in comparison to untreated controls<br>
(herbicidal effect in per cent (%): 100% effect = the plants have died, 0% effect = like control<br>
plants).<br>
At active compound concentrations of 320 g of a.i./ha, the active compound I-l-a-2, applied by the<br>
pre-emergence method, shows a kill rate of &gt; 80% against Lolium and Setaria.<br>

Example G<br>
Herbicidal action and safener action, pre-emergence or post-emergence<br>
Seeds of rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants and of crop<br>
plants are placed into sandy loam in pots made of peat, covered with soil and cultivated in a<br>
greenhouse under growth conditions. In the pre-emergence application, safener and herbicide are<br>
applied after sowing, the post-emergence treatment is carried out about two to three weeks after<br>
sowing, at the three-leaf stage of the test plants. The herbicide/safener active compound<br>
combinations according to the invention, formulated as emulsion concentrates, and in parallel<br>
experiments the correspondingly formulated individual active compounds are, at various dosages<br>
at a water application rate of 300 1/ha (converted), sprayed onto the surface of the soil when<br>
applied by the pre-emergence method and onto the green parts of the plants when applied by the<br>
post-emergence method. Pre-emergence evaluation is carried out after 2-4 weeks, post-emergence<br>
evaluation is carried out after 1-3 weeks. During this time, the test plants are kept in a greenhouse<br>
under optimum growth conditions. The effect of the preparation is scored visually in comparison<br>
to untreated controls.<br>
Container trials with cereal in the greenhouse.<br>
Safener and herbicide were applied successively to the plants by the post-emergence method<br>
(application rates: see Tables)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example H<br>
Safener action after seed dressing<br>
The number of crop plant seeds needed for each safener application rate was calculated. Based on<br>
the weight of 100 seeds, sufficient seeds were weighed into screw top glass bottles approximately<br>
twice the volume of the seeds.<br>
The prospective safeners were formulated as wettable powders or water-dispersible granules.<br>
These formulations were weighed out so that the required application rates (g of a.i./kg of seed)<br>
were obtained. The samples were added to the seeds in the bottles, followed by sufficient water to<br>
produce a seed dressing. The bottles were closed and then placed in an overhead shaker (set at<br>
medium speed for a period of up to one hour) so that the seeds were evenly coated with the seed<br>
dressing. The bottles were opened and the seeds were used in the pre-emergence tests.<br>
Pre-emergence application of herbicides<br>
The safener-treated seeds and untreated seeds as controls were sown in a sandy loam soil in round<br>
pots having a diameter of 7 to 13 cm and covered with approximately 0.5 to 1 cm of a 1:1 mix of<br>
sandy loam soil and sand. The herbicides, as liquid (for example emulsifiable concentrates) or dry<br>
(for example wettable powders) formulations, were diluted to the required concentrations using<br>
deionized water and applied to the soil surface using a track sprayer calibrated to deliver 300 litres<br>
of spray solution per hectare.<br>
The pots were placed under good growing conditions in a greenhouse, and a visual assessment of<br>
the herbicidal effects was made 3 to 4 weeks after the application of the herbicide. The assessment<br>
was on a percentage basis in comparison,to untreated control plants (0% = no damage, 100% =<br>
complete kill).<br>

Example I<br>
Critical concentration test/soil insects - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
Test insect: Diabrotica balteata - larvae in soil<br>
Solvent: 7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is<br>
mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the<br>
concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
The preparation of active compound is poured onto the soil. Here, the concentration of active<br>
compound in the preparation is virtually immaterial, only the amount by weight of active<br>
compound per volume unit of soil, which is stated in ppm (mg/1), matters. The soil is filled into<br>
0.25 1 pots, and these are allowed to stand at 20°C.<br>
Immediately after the preparation, 5 pregerminated maize corns of the cultivar YIELD GUARD<br>
(trade mark of Monsanto Comp., USA) are placed into each pot. After 2 days, the appropriate test<br>
insects are placed into the treated soil. After a further 7 days, the efficacy of the active compound<br>
is determined by counting the maize plants that have emerged (1 plant = 20% activity).<br>
Example J<br>
Heliothis virescens Test - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
Solvent: 7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is<br>
mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifier, and the concentrate is<br>
diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Soybean shoots (Glycine max) of the cultivar Roundup Ready (trade mark of Monsanto Comp.,<br>
USA) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired<br>
concentration and are populated with the tobacco bud worm Heliothis virescens while the leaves<br>
are still moist.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill of the insects is determined.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
