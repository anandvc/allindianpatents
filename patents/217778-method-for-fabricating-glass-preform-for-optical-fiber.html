				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
METHOD FOR FABRICATING GLASS PREFORM FOR OPTICAL-. -FIBER"<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber having a silica glass portion doped with fluorine, which has a step of performing deposition of fine glass particles by the vapor phase axial deposition (VAD) process. Related Background Art<br>
Optical fibers have the structure of the core and the cladding having a lower refractive index than the core and surrounding the core.  Utilizing the refractive index difference between the core and the cladding, light is transmitted as confined in and near the core.<br>
Thus, in order to achieve the function as an optical fiber, a dopant for raising or lowering the refractive index is added to a base material, thereby realizing a desired refractive index profile.  If the base material is silica glass, fluorine is suitably<br>
used as a dopant for lowering the refractive index.<br>
The optical fiber having the silica glass portion<br>
doped with fluorine is fabricated by heating and drawing a glass preform for optical fiber having the<br>
silica glass portion doped with fluorine.  Such glass preforms for optical fiber have been fabricated heretofore as follows.<br>
The first conventional method for forming the silica glass portion doped with fluorine (hereinafter referred to as conventional example 1) is arranged, for example as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-38292, in such a manner that, for growing a body of fine glass particles by the VAD process, glass raw material gas and combustion gas are supplied and glass particles are deposited in the direction of target axis by flame hydrolysis and thereafter a consolidating step of glass particles is carried out under an atmosphere of fluorine compound gas, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber having the glass portion doped with fluorine. ,r<br>
The second conventional method for forming the silica glass portion doped with fluorine (hereinafter referred to as conventional example 2) is arranged, for example as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 59-232934, in such a manner that, for growing a body of fine glass particles by the VAD process, the both glass raw material gas and combustion gas, or only the combustion gas containing the fluorine compound gas in a concentration kept constant in terms of the time is supplied and fine glass particles are<br>
deposited in the direction of target axis by flame hydrolysis and thereafter the fine glass particles are consolidated, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber.<br>
The following methods are proposed as methods for making fluorine doping concentrations uniform mainly in the radial direction in the glass preform for optical fiber the base material of which is silica glass.<br>
In the method disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,039,325, first, the fluorine compound gas is mixed in the glass raw material gas and fine glass particles are deposited by the outside vapor deposition process. Next, the volume of a heating furnace is set slightly larger than that of a deposit body of glass particles and heating is effected on the deposit body as decreasing supply amounts of the atmospheric gas upon heating so as to transparentize the deposit body.  As a result, a vaporization amount of fluorine is decreased from the peripheral portion upon the heating transparentization, thereby obtaining the glass preform for optical fiber with the fluorine doping amounts uniform in the radial direction.<br>
In the method as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 61-236626, first, fine glass particles are deposited using a mixture of the fluorine compound gas mixed in the glass raw material gas in<br>
lower concentration as approaching the peripheral portion. Next, the deposit body is heated to be transparentized under an atmosphere containing fluorine or a fluorine compound. As a result, differences of fluorine doping amounts in the radial direction upon deposition of glass particles are canceled by differences of fluorine doping amounts in the radial direction upon heating transparentization, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber with fluorine doping amounts uniform in the radial direction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber having a silica glass portion doped with fluorine by vapor phase axial deposition, comprising:<br>
a first step of introducing glass raw material gas and fluorine compound gas into oxyhydrogen flame and depositing fine glass particles in the direction of a target axis by flame hydrolysis, thereby letting a deposited body of said fine glass particles grow in said direction of the target axis; wherein a period of growth of said deposit body of the fine glass particles comprises a period during which an initial flow rate of said fluorine compound gas (Vi) introduced into said oxyhydrogen flame is montonically and linearly increased to a final flow rate of said fluorine compound gas (¥2); and,<br>
a second step of heating to transparentize said deposit body of the fine glass particles.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber having a silica glass portion doped with low-concentration fluorine with high uniformity in the growing direction.<br>
The method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber according to the<br>
present invention is a method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber<br>
having a silica glass portion doped with fluorine by vapor phase axial<br>
deposition (VAD; Vapor Phase Axial Deposition), which comprises (a) a first<br>
of	step	of introducing	glass raw material gas and<br>
fluorine compound gas into oxyhydrogen flame and depositing<br>
fine glass particles in adirection of a target axis by<br>
flame hydrolysis, thereby growing a deposit body of fine glass particles in the direction of the target axis, wherein a period of growth of the deposit body of fine glass particles comprises a period for increasing a flow rate of the fluorine compound gas supplied; and (b) a second step of heating to transparentize the deposit body of fine glass particles.<br>
In the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber of conventional example 1, the fluorine doping amounts are proportional to the one-quarter power of the fluorine compound gas in the atmospheric gas, as well known.  Thus, fluorine was able to be added in the range of the decrease rate of refractive index of from -0.2 % to -0.7 % approximately with respect to pure silica, but it was not easy to realize such low-concentration doping of fluorine as to achieve the decrease rate of the refractive index of -0.2 or less % with respect to pure silica.<br>
Therefore, in order to realize such low-concentration doping of fluorine as to achieve the decrease rate of refractive index of -0.2 or less % by fluorine doping in the fluorine-doping region, a suitably applicable method is the method for effecting doping of fluorine by supplying the glass raw material gas and fluorine compound gas to flame upon deposition of glass particles.<br>
However, according to the knowledge attained from the results of research by the inventors, in the optical fiber preforms fabricated by the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber of conventional example 2, fluorine concentrations in deposits of glass particles formed in the initial stage of the deposition process of glass particles are higher than those in deposits of glass particles formed in the final stage of the deposition process of glass particles, and therefore, it is not possible to obtain optical fibers with good uniformity of index profile in the longitudinal direction.<br>
The nonuniformity of index profile results in, typically, causing longitudinal nonuniformity of cut¬off wavelength A.c of optical fiber.  Accordingly, it is necessary to enhance the uniformity of index profile in the longitudinal direction of optical fiber in order to obtain optical fibers with stable transmission characteristics.<br>
According to the knowledge of the inventors, the above phenomenon is considered to occur by the following two effects.<br>
The first effect is as follows.  Since after stop of deposition on the start end side of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles, the fluorine compound gas is also still supplied to the portion<br>
under deposition present vertically below the start end, the atmospheric gas around the start end side of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles thus contains the fluorine compound gas.  Further, a high-temperature state upon deposition continues, because the deposit body of glass particles has a low thermal conductivity.  Namely, on the start end side of deposition, the high-temperature deposit body of glass particles is exposed to the atmosphere of fluorine compound gas for a longer time than on the end side of stop of deposition.  As a result, if the flow rates of the fluorine compound gas are constant throughout the period of the step of deposition, the doping amounts of fluorine on the start end side of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles are greater than those on the stop end side of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles.<br>
The second effect is as follows.  In the step of heating transparentization of the deposit body of glass particles, normally, the deposit body of glass particles is inserted into the heating furnace, the heater is activated to raise the temperature to start heating from the end side of stop of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles, and thereafter the deposit body of glass particles is moved relative to the heater.  Then heating is continued up to the end<br>
side of start of deposition finally.  In this step of transparentization, with increase in temperature of heater radiation heat from the heater irradiates the end side of stop of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles so as to heat the end side of stop of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles.  In other words, the heating period is longer on the end side of stop of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles.  Accordingly, if the atmospheric gas does not contain the fluorine compound, the vaporization amount of fluorine becomes larger from the end side of stop of deposition of the deposit body of glass particles than from the other portions.<br>
A combination of the above two effects causes the longitudinal change of fluorine doping amounts.<br>
Since the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber according to the present invention is arranged so that in depositing fine glass particles in the direction of the target axis the concentration of fluorine compound in the supplied gas is increased with growth of the deposit body of glass particles in the direction of the target axis, the fluorine doping amounts upon deposition of glass particles are smaller in portions closer to the end side of start of deposition of glass particles, which are exposed to the gas atmosphere containing fluorine for a longer period<br>
since deposition of glass particles, whereas the fluorine doping amounts upon deposition of glass particles are larger in portions closer to the end side of stop of deposition of glass particles, which are exposed to the gas atmosphere containing fluorine for a shorter period since deposition of glass particles.<br>
On the other hand, when the high-temperature deposit body of glass particles is exposed to the gas atmosphere containing fluorine, the fluorine doping amount increases in accordance with the period of exposure.<br>
Accordingly, the fluorine doping amounts become uniform in the direction of the target axis at the time of completion of the first step and the second step in the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber according to the present invention.<br>
The inventors conducted experiments to check uniformity of decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) in the direction of growth depending upon change amounts of supply of CF4 gas, which is fluorine compound gas to the glass raw material gas SiCl,, in column fluorine-doped silica glass by the VAD process.  The decrease rate of refractive index, AnF(L), is defined by the following equation.<br>
AnF(L) = (nF(L) - n()}/n0 where nn: refractive index of pure silica glass<br>
L: distance from the start end<br>
nF(L): refractive index at L<br>
Fig. 1 is a graph to show the results of the experiments.  Fig. 1 shows the results of (1) the case of monotonically and linearly changing the supply amount of CF4 from 35 SCCM to 70 SCCM (Experiment 1), (2) the case of keeping the supply amount of CF4 constant at 50 SCCM (Experiment 2), and (3) the case of monotonically and linearly changing the supply amount of CF4 from 5 SCCM to 100 SCCM (Experiment 3).  Fig. 1 proved that uniformity of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) cannot be achieved without changing the supply amount of CF4 and that uniformity of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) cannot be achieved with too large change of supply amount of CF4. The inventors also conducted experiments to change a ratio of initial flow rate value and final flow rate value of CF4 gas as linearly changing the flow rate of CF4 gas.  Fig. 2 is a graph to show the results of these serial experiments, which shows a change in index change amount A(AnF) efined by the following equation against R = {(final flow rate of CF4)/(initial flow rate of CF4)}.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where  AnFMAX:   maximum value of AnF(L) AnF     :   minimum value of  AnF(L)<br>
Fig. 2 proved that the index change amount A(AnF) becomes minimal at R = 2.0 and that in order to achieve preferable uniformity of A(AnF) 
The inventors further conducted experiments to measure a change of the decrease rate of refractive index in the direction of growth due to fluorine doping with respect to the case of no doping with fluorine, i.e., with respect to pure silica glass with fixing the initial flow rate of 35 SCCM and the final flow rate of 70 SCCM (i.e., with R = 2.0), for the following four ways of changing the flow rate of CF4 gas: (1) the case of linear change (above Experiment 1); (2) the case of change of a quadratic function (Experiment 4); (3) the case of change of a cubic function (Experiment 5); and (4) the case of change of a function of the one-half degree (Experiment 6).<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph to show the change of flow rate of CF, gas in the direction of growth in Experiments 1 and 4 to 6.  Since the growth rate of glass particles in the target-axis direction is almost constant, the distance from the growth start end is proportional to the time from start of growth.  Therefore, the<br>
description hereinafter uses either the distance from the growth start end or the time from the growth start selectively with necessity, but it is noted that they have equivalent meaning.<br>
In Fig. 3, the flow rate Vf^t) of CF4 in Experiment 1, the flow rate Vf4(t) of CF4 in Experiment 4, the flow rate Vf3(t) of CF4 in Experiment 5, and the flow rate Vf6(t) of CF4 in Experiment 6 are determined as follows in the unit of SCCM:<br>
Vft(t) = 35t/te + 35<br>
Vf4(t) = 35(t/te)2 + 35<br>
Vf5(t) = 35(t/te)3 + 35<br>
Vf6(t) = 35(t/te)'/2 + 35<br>
where t: time having elapsed from growth start time<br>
te: time of growth stop.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph to show the experiment results of Experiments 1 and 4 to 6, showing the measurement results of change of the decrease rete of refractive index in the growth direction to pure silica glass, for the glass bodies obtained in the respective experiments.<br>
Fig. 4 proved that Experiment 4 has the highest uniformity of fluorine doping amount, thus suggesting that the most preferable change of flow rate of CF4 is the change of quadratic function.<br>
It was also confirmed that in the case of<br>
Experiment 1 wherein the change of flow rate of CF4 is of a linear function, uniformity of the decrease rate of refractive index can be maintained in the growth direction as described above, but the curve of Fig. 4 representing Experiment 5 with the change of flow rate of CF4 being of the cubic function is heavily convex while the curve of Fig. 4 representing Experiment 6 with the change of flow rate of CF4 being of the function of the one-half degree is heavily concave. Namely, it was confirmed that the supply amount of fluorine compound gas is preferably a linear or quadratic function of the length of deposition in the target-axis direction of glass particles, i.e., of the passing time from the growth start time.<br>
Here, let us suppose a case in which the length of growth in the target-axis direction of the deposit body of glass particles is long.  Considering the two effects, as described above, which are potential causes of nonuniformity of fluorine doping amount in the target-axis direction, if the length of growth is long in the target-axis direction of the deposit body of glass particles, the same thermal hysteresis from the viewpoint of fluorine doping is applied up to a certain length from the position of growth start end.  This means that in the portion where the same thermal hysteresis from the viewpoint of fluorine doping is<br>
applied, the uniformity of fluorine doping amount is high when the supply of fluorine gas is constant.<br>
Therefore, in the cases where the length of growth in the target-axis direction of the deposit body of glass particles is so long as to form the portion in which the same thermal hysteresis from the viewpoint of fluorine doping can be applied, the flow rate of fluorine compound gas is kept constant from the growth start time up to a predetermined time and thereafter the flow rate of fluorine compound gas is increased in the above preferable pattern of change, whereby the glass preform for optical fiber can be obtained with high uniformity of fluorine doping amount in the growth direction.<br>
The inventors conducted experiments to measure a change of the decrease rate of refractive index in direction of growth with changing a deposited length at which the flow rate of the fluorine compound gas started to change.  As the result of these experiments, the inventors find that it is preferable to start to change the flow rate of the fluorine compound gas when the length of the rest part to be deposited is 4±0.5 times as long as the diameter of the deposit body from the viewpoint of achieving the uniformity of fluorine doping.<br>
Since doping of fluorine is carried out for the<br>
purpose of decreasing the refractive index, the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber according to the present invention can be suitably adopted for fabrication of a glass preform for optical fiber having a portion to become the cladding doped with fluorine.  Particularly, the method for fabricating a glass preform of the present invention is effective in making the fluorine doping amounts uniform in the axial direction in the region of the decrease rate of refractive index to silica glass below -0.2 %.<br>

The embodiments of the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.  In the description with the drawings same reference numerals will denote same elements and redundant description will be omitted. (Embodiment 1)<br>
Figs. 5 to 9 are explanatory drawings of Embodiment 1 of the method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, in the method for fabricating a glass preform of the present embodiment, first, raw material gases of GeCl4 and SiCl4, together with combustion gases of H2 and 02, were supplied to a core-depositing burner 510 at the tip of starting glass rod 300 supported on a supporting rod 410 in a soot-deposition container 400 having an exhaust port 420 and, further, Ar, He, or the like was supplied as carrier gas.  Also supplied to a cladding-depositing burner 520 were raw material gas of SiCl4, combustion gases of H2 and 02, carrier gas of Ar, He, or the like, and fluorine-doping gas of CF4.<br>
In flame of burner 510 or burner 520 the glass raw material was subject to hydrolysis to form fine glass particles, and these glass particles were deposited to form porous glass soot comprised of glass soot 100 for the core and glass soot 200 for the internal cladding.<br>
The porous glass soot was let to grow in the axial direction by pulling the support rod 410 up as rotating it.  With this growth, the supply amount of CF4 gas, Vf(t), was increased in accordance with the following equation while keeping supply amounts of the other gases constant:<br>
Vf(t) = 50(t/te) + 50   (unit: SCCM) where t: passing time from start of growth<br>
te: passing time from start of growth to end of growth;<br>
whereby the supply amount having been 50 SCCM at start of deposition was increased monotonically and linearly up to the supply amount of 100 SCCM at the end of deposition.<br>
The amount of growth of preform was 800 mm in the target-axis direction.<br>
Next, the porous glass soot was inserted into a consolidating furnace 600 to perform dehydration process and transparent glass forming process.  Figs. 6 and 7 are explanatory drawings of the dehydration process and transparent glass forming process, wherein<br>
Fig. 6 shows a state at start of these processes and Fig. 7 shows a state in the middle of the processes. First, the dehydration process was carried out at the descending rate of about 10 mm/min and in an atmosphere of Cl2/He = 0.5/20 (slm) kept at 1000 to 1300 °C by heater 610.  Then the transparent glass forming process was carried out at the descending rate of about 7 mm/min and in an atmosphere of He of almost 100 % kept at 1500 to 1650 °C by heater 610.  These processes yielded a glass body 710 comprised of a glass portion 110 to become the core and a glass portion 210 to become the internal cladding.<br>
Fig. 8 is a graph to show the measurement results of change of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) of the glass portion 210 to become the internal cladding with respect to pure silica glass in the growth direction.<br>
In the glass body 710 thus obtained, an absolute value of a difference between a value at the growth start end and a value at the growth stop end of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) of the glass portion 210 to become the internal cladding to pure silica glass was 0.003 %.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 9, the glass body 310 supported by the support rod 460 was inserted into a soot-deposition container 450 having an exhaust port<br>
470, and supplied to a deposition burner 530 for external cladding were raw material gas of SiCl4, combustion gases of H2 and Oa, and carrier gas of Ar, He, or the like.<br>
In flame of burner 530 the glass raw material was subject to hydrolysis to form fine glass particles substantially comprised of pure silica glass and these glass particles were deposited to form porous glass soot comprised of glass soot 220 for external cladding.<br>
The porous glass soot 220 was let to grow in the axial direction by pulling the support rod 460 up as rotating it.<br>
Then the glass soot 220 for external cladding was heated to be transparentized in the same manner as in Figs. 6 and 7, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber.<br>
The glass preform for optical fiber thus obtained was drawn into a fiber, thus fabricating an optical fiber in the outer diameter of 125 µm.  The cut-off wavelengths X(. were measured for the optical fiber. From the measurement results, an absolute value of a difference between the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth start end of the glass preform for optical fiber and the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth stop end of<br>
the glass preform for optical fiber was 10 nm. (Embodiment 2)<br>
In the present embodiment, when the soot for internal cladding was let to grow in the axial direction by deposition of glass particles of Fig. 5 in Embodiment 1, the supply amount of CF4 gas Vf(t) [unit: SCCM] was increased according to the following equation while keeping the other supply amounts constant:<br>
Vf(t) = 75 (t/te)2 + 50 where t: passing time from start of growth<br>
te: passing time from start of growth to end of growth;<br>
whereby the supply amount having been 50 SCCM at start of deposition was increased up to the supply amount of 125 SCCM at end of deposition.<br>
After that, the dehydration process and transparent glass forming process as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 were carried out in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, thereby obtaining a glass body.<br>
Fig. 10 is a graph to show the measurement results of change of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) of the glass portion to become the internal cladding, obtained in the present embodiment, to pure silica glass in the growth direction.  In the glass body obtained in the present embodiment, the absolute value of the difference between the value at the growth start<br>
end and the value at the growth stop end of the decrease rate of refractive index of the glass portion to become the internal cladding to pure silica glass was 0.001 %.<br>
Next, in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, the glass soot for external cladding was let to grow in the axial direction as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Then the glass soot for external cladding was heated to be transparentized in the same manner as in Figs. 6 and 7, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber.<br>
The glass preform for optical fiber thus obtained was drawn into a fiber, thus fabricating an optical fiber in the outer diameter of 125 µm.  The cut-off wavelengths A.(. were measured for the optical fiber. From the measurement results, the absolute value of the difference between the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth start end of the glass preform for optical fiber and the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth stop end of the glass preform for optical fiber was 5 nm.

deposition of glass particles of Fig. 5, the supply amount of CF4 gas Vf(t) [unit: SCCM] was increased according to the following equations as keeping the other supply amounts constant: Vf(t) = 50; 0 
ts: passing time from start of growth up to the length of 300 mm<br>
te: passing time from start of growth up to the end of growth;<br>
whereby the supply amount having been 50 SCCM at start of deposition was increased up to the supply amount of 100 SCCM at end of deposition.<br>
After that, the dehydration process and transparent glass forming process as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 were carried out in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, thereby obtaining a glass body.<br>
Fig. 11 is a graph to show the measurement results of change of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) of the glass portion to become the internal cladding, obtained in the present embodiment, to pure silica glass in the growth direction.  In the glass body obtained in the present embodiment, the absolute value of the difference between the value at the growth start end and the value at the growth stop end of the<br>
decrease rate of refractive index of the glass portion to become the internal cladding to pure silica glass was 0.004 %.<br>
Next, in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, the glass soot for external cladding was let to grow in the axial direction as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Then the glass soot for external cladding was heated to be transparentized in the same manner as in Figs. 6 and 7, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber.<br>
The glass preform for optical fiber thus obtained was drawn into a fiber, thus fabricating an optical fiber in the outer diameter of 125 µm.  The cut-off wavelengths A.c were measured for the optical fiber. From the measurement results, the absolute value of the difference between the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth start end of the glass preform for optical fiber and the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth stop end of the glass preform for optical fiber was 18 nm. (Embodiment 4)<br>
In the present embodiment, the length of growth of the porous soot in Embodiment 1 was 1100 mm, and when the soot for internal cladding was let to grow by deposition of glass particles of Fig. 5, the supply<br>
amount of CF4 gas Vf(t) [unit: SCCM] was increased according to the following equations as keeping the other supply amounts constant: Vf(t) = 50; 0 
ts: passing time from start of growth up to the length of 300 mm<br>
te: passing time from start of growth up to the end of growth;<br>
whereby the supply amount having been 50 SCCM at start of deposition was increased up to the supply amount of 125 SCCM at end of deposition.<br>
After that, the dehydration process and transparent glass forming process as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 were carried out in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, thereby obtaining a glass body.<br>
Fig. 12 is a graph to show the measurement results of change of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) of the glass portion to become the internal cladding, obtained in the present embodiment, to pure silica glass in the growth direction.  In the glass body obtained in the present embodiment, the absolute value of the difference between the value at the growth start end and the value at the growth stop end of the decrease rate of refractive index of the glass portion<br>
to become the internal cladding to pure silica glass was 0.002 %.<br>
Next, in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, the glass soot for external cladding was let to grow in the axial direction as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Then the glass soot for external cladding was heated to be transparentized in the same manner as in Figs. 6 and 7, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber.<br>
The glass preform for optical fiber thus obtained was drawn into a fiber, thus fabricating an optical fiber in the outer diameter of 125 µm.  The cut-off wavelengths Xc were measured for the optical fiber. From the measurement results, the absolute value of the difference between the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth start end of the glass preform for optical fiber and the cut-off wavelength in the portion of the optical fiber corresponding to the growth stop end of the glass preform for optical fiber was 14 nm.<br>
For comparison with the glass preforms for optical fiber fabricated in the above embodiments, the inventors fabricated a glass preform for optical fiber as a comparative example under the conditions that the length of growth of the porous soot was 1100 mm and the supply amount of CF, was kept constant at 50 SCCM.<br>
Fig. 13 is a graph to show the change depending upon the position, of the decrease rate of refractive index (AnF) of the glass portion to become the internal cladding in the glass preform for optical fiber as the comparative example.  From Fig. 13, the absolute value of the difference between the value at the deposition start end and the value at the deposition stop end of AnF of the glass preform for optical fiber of the comparative example was 0.02 %.<br>
Next, in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, the glass soot for external cladding was let to grow in the axial direction as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Then the glass soot for external cladding was heated to be transparentized in the same manner as in Figs. 6 and 7, thereby obtaining a glass preform for optical fiber.<br>
The glass preform for optical fiber thus obtained was drawn into a fiber, thus fabricating an optical fiber in the outer diameter of 125 µm.  The cut-off wavelengths X(. were measured for the optical fiber. From the measurement results, the change of the cut-off wavelength after drawn into a fiber was 100 nm.<br>
The above confirmed that the present invention is effective as a method for fabricating a glass preform for optical fiber having a uniform index profile independent of the position.<br>
The present invention can be modified without having to be limited to the above embodiments.  For example, the above embodiments used CF4 as a fluoride compound, but the same effect can be achieved by using another fluoride compound selected from CC12F2, C2F6, SiF4, SF6/ and the like.<br>
The above embodiments concerned the glass preforms for optical fiber with the index profile shown in Fig. 14, but the present invention can also be applied to formation of a glass body in a portion having a lower refractive index than that of pure silica glass in fabrication of glass preforms for optical fiber with either one of the index profiles shown in Figs. 15 to 17.<br>
From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the invention may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br>
