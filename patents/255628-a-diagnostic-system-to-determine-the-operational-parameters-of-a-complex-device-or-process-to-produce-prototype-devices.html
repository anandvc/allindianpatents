Not Applicable<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to one or more expert systems and, in<br>
particular, to expert systems for use in connection with simulation or optimization<br>
systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Simulation systems exist to simulate devices or processes. For example, a<br>
simulator has been created to simulate the performance of an engine built to a<br>
particular specification. To specify a complete engine from intakes to exhaust,<br>
however, may require the specification of more than a thousand attributes. For<br>
example, the definition of valves in each cylinder typically requires the specification<br>
of the number of intake and exhaust valves, the diameter of each valve, cam<br>
properties including the lift of each valve, the timing and speed of opening and<br>
closing of each valve, etc. Of course there are many other complex parts of a typical<br>
modern engine and so it may be seen that definition of a complete operational<br>
engine is a complex undertaking, but one that has been necessary to perform a<br>
comprehensive simulation. Thus, there is a need for an expert system that will<br>
specify all of the attributes of a complete model given only a limited specification<br>
provided by a user. There is also a need for an expert system that preserves models<br>
for future reuse.<br>
Optimization systems also exist to simulate multiple models to find one or<br>
more models that best achieve one or more goals. For example, an optimization<br><br>
system has been created that causes one or more attributes of an engine to be<br>
varied, simulations to be performed on each engine variation, and comparison made<br>
betwee the performance of each simulation to determine one or more optimum<br>
engine configurations. The optimization strategy, however, is typically complex,<br>
requiring the definition of many attributes that affect one another in subtle ways. For<br>
example, a design space may be selected that defines borders to the extent to which<br>
the optimization system will vary values of attributes during an optimization. Design<br>
tolerance attributes may be selected to determine the proximity of values within the<br>
design space to be considered. Random selection may furthermore be utilized to<br>
choose fewer than all tolerance points in the design space for simulation. Thus, the<br>
size of the design space, the proximity of values to be considered within the design<br>
space and the portion of the values within the design space to be selected randomly<br>
for simulation are intertwined in a way that is complex, particularly to a novice<br>
designer. Thus, there is a need for an expert system that will specify all of the<br>
attributes of a complete optimization strategy given only a limited specification<br>
provided by a user. There is also a need for an expert system that preserves proven<br>
strategies for future reuse.<br>
It is also desirable to create a strategy that is aimed at optimizing a particular<br>
aspect of a model and is also applicabTe to that same aspect of, for example, a<br>
similar model in a different size. An example related to engines may be drawn from<br>
the fact that engine geometries vary from small engines having a single cylinder and<br>
small displacements to engines having twelve or more cylinders and large<br>
displacements. Needs that are common to both small and large engines often exist,<br>
however, that could be resolved by the same strategy if that strategy was based on<br>
the size of the engine or a portion thereof. Thus, there is also a need to symbolically<br>
define the way attributes that are to vary during simulation, such that those symbolic<br>
definitions, are applicable to models of various sizes and configurations. There is<br>
also a need for an expert system that preserves symbolic definitions for reuse.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
expert system, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It is<br>
to be understood that the Figures and descriptions of embodiments included herein<br>
illustrate and describe elements that are of particular relevance, while eliminating, for<br>
purposes of clarity, other elements found in typical computers and computer<br>
networks.<br>
The present expert system provides solutions to the shortcomings of certain<br>
previous design methods and systems. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily<br>
appreciate that while embodiments of the present invention are described in<br>
connection with engine design, aspects of the invention are applicable beyond<br>
engine design. For example, the expert system techniques disclosed and claimed<br>
herein may be applicable to simulation and optimization systems for various<br>
purposes and complex computational systems in general, the user interface<br>
described herein may also be applicable in a variety of useful applications. Thus,<br>
while certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to engine design,<br>
the present invention and aspects thereof are recognized to be beneficial in a variety<br>
of applications. Other details, features, and advantages of the design optimization<br>
will become further apparent in the following detailed description of the<br>
embodiments.<br><br>
Systems, apparatuses, and method to perform expert systems are described<br>
herein, including processor based apparatuses, multi-processor based systems, and<br>
articles of manufacture that contain instructions which, when executed by a<br>
processor cause the processor to perform expert systems functions. Any reference<br>
in the specification to "one embodiment," "a certain embodiment," or a similar<br>
reference to an embodiment is intended to indicate that a particular feature, structure<br>
or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least<br>
one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of such terms in various places<br>
in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.<br>
References to "or" are furthermore intended as inclusive so "or" may indicate one or<br>
the other ored terms or more than one ored term.<br>
While the present invention may be utilized to optimize a variety of complex<br>
apparatuses and processes, the following embodiments are directed to use of the<br>
present invention in optimizing an internal combustion engine. Such an engine has<br>
many attributes that contribute to the operation of the engine and many desirable<br>
goals. The attributes of an internal combustion engine include, for example, valve <br>
quantity and size, piston diameter and stroke, ignition timing, fuel delivery, quantity, <br>
and timing and exhaust pipe diameter and length. Goals for operation of an internal<br>
combustion engine include, for example, fuel consumption, emissions, torque, and<br>
power.<br>
In the following description, the term "variable set" is utilized to indicate a set<br>
of variable values that may be utilized to run a single simulation. A "run" or<br>
"simulation" is an act of running a simulation on a variable set under given test	<br>
conditions. A "test procedure" is a set of test conditions under which a run occurs. A <br>
"result" includes the value or values of characteristics or dependent variables from a<br>
simulation of a set of variables according to test conditions. The term "solution"<br>
refers to a group of one or more runs utilized to evaluate goals. The term "pass"<br>
indicates a collection of solutions that is ranked to find the best variable set or sets.<br>
The term "optimum" is utilized to indicate a local optimum, which is the best variable<br>
set from the ranked set of solutions of a pass. A "model" is a set of variables that<br>
may be simulated and a "design configuration" is a model embodying a design.<br><br>
An expert system is generally a computer program that simulates the<br>
judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge<br>
and experience in a particular field. Typically, such a system contains a	<br>
knowledgebase containing information based on accumulated experience of users<br>
and the expert system. Expert systems have become known in recent times<br>
primarily for their ability to assist in diagnosis of problems. For example, computer<br>
professionals may utilize expert systems to guide them through the complex<br>
interaction of modern computer systems to diagnose the cause of computer system<br>
problems. Doctors may also use expert systems to assist them in diagnosing patient<br>
illnesses in a modern world wherein much is known about disease and sickness, but<br>
much of what is known overlaps and is contradictory.<br>
The present expert system contemplates an expert system for use in aiding<br>
designers that desire to simulate complex devices or processes to estimate the<br>
operation of those devices or processes. For example, it is often desired by<br>
designers of devices that the operation of those devices be simulated and proven to<br>
the greatest possible degree before prototype devices are built. Simulation of<br>
complex devices is usually much faster and much less expensive than building such<br>
a device. Complex devices, even well known devices such as vehicle engines, <br>
however, are often so complex to define for simulation that it requires an expert to <br>
create an engine definition to be simulated and a strategy for how to perform the<br>
simulation. The present invention, therefore, offers a knowledgebase of expertise<br>
that may be leveraged by expert designers and novice designers to define complex<br>
models and strategies with limited information from a human designer.<br>
The knowledgebase utilized in embodiments of the invention may include a<br>
database that is machine readable and contains knowledge utilized in the system.<br>
That knowledge may include, for example, information related to objectives, such as<br>
goal and test procedure definitions; information related to strategies, such as<br>
optimization rules; information related to models; and results of simulations and<br>
optimizations. The knowledgebase of those expert systems may provide the benefit<br>
of tracking changes made to information contained in the knowledgebase through a<br>
simulation or optimization and new information entered into the simulation or<br>
optimization system.<br><br>
A comparison feature may be associated with the knowledgebase that<br>
compares information utilized in optimizations with information contained in the<br>
knowledgebase to determine what information is new and automatically store new<br>
information in the knowledgebase. Thus, the knowledgebase of the expert system<br>
may grow and be improved. For example, every new model that is created by a<br>
designer and/or the expert system may be saved in the knowledgebase, thus<br>
building a comprehensive library of models that may be used or modified for use in<br>
future optimizations. Similarly, every new strategy created by a designer and/or the<br>
expert system may be saved in the knowledgebase, thus building a comprehensive<br>
library of strategies. Alternately, rules governing information to be stored may be<br>
utilized to store, for example, only information that provides improved results.<br>
Quality of each model or strategy stored in the database may also be maintained by,<br>
for example, categorizing them as approved for proven models and strategies,<br>
unapproved for experimental models and strategies, or foreign for models and<br>
strategies brought into the system from elsewhere.<br>
Evolution of data stored in the knowledgebase may also be maintained so that<br>
the process that created that data may be reviewed. For example, strategies that<br>
were modified to create a new strategy may be maintained in a genealogical format.<br>
The person or workstation that created information in the knowledgebase and when<br>
that information was created may also be saved for tracking purposes. The<br>
evolution data may be used, for example, by management to determine what people<br>
and processes create the highest quality models and strategies.<br>
Thus, the present expert system may provide, for example, complete device<br>
definitions in various configurations in the knowledgebase. The expert system may<br>
then match device attributes input by a designer by way of, for example, a template<br>
to one or more complete device definitions that most closely correspond to the input<br>
attributes and select one or more of the complete device definitions for further use.<br>
Similarly, the present expert system may provide, for example, complete<br>
strategy definitions in the knowledgebase. Those strategy definitions may, for<br>
example, define how to simulate various devices and how to formulate solutions to<br>
various goals. The expert system may then match strategy attributes input by a<br><br>
designer by way of, for example, a template to one or more complete strategy<br>
definitions that most closely correspond to the input attributes and save one or more<br>
of the complete strategy definitions for further use.<br>
In an embodiment, the expert systems operate to assist in optimization. The<br>
optimization system utilized in examples provided herein include three major	<br>
aspects: a base model that defines values of all attributes that are required by the <br>
simulator, an objective that is related generally to goals of the optimization, and a <br>
strategy that is related generally to which attributes of the base model will vary and<br>
to what degree they will vary during optimization.	<br>
Thus, an embodiment of the present expert system utilizes a base design that<br>
is a starting definition of attributes and components to be modified to create an<br>
optimized design. The expert system also utilizes objectives that contain one or<br>
more specifications, each specification containing one or more goals and one or<br>
more test procedures. The expert system also utilizes a strategy that includes one<br>
or more variables, constraints, and an inference engine.<br>
Rules for optimization may be distributed throughout an optimization system.<br>
For example, rules for attributes may be embedded in the base model by, for<br>
example, defining an attribute by an equation based upon another attribute. Rules<br>
may also be embedded in objectives. For example, whether a goal is to be<br>
minimized, maximized, matched, used as a high limit, or used as a low limit are rules<br>
that may be defined in the objective. Weighting of multiple goals may also be<br>
defined in the objective. Weighting may also be applied to a plurality of points for<br>
each of one or more goals in the objective. For example, goals may be evaluated at<br>
particular rpm points. Each of those points may then be weighted independently if<br>
desired. Rules may furthermore be embedded in strategies. For example, variable<br>
parameters, constraints such as equations used to calculate certain attributes, and<br>
exploration rules may be defined in strategies.<br>
A subtlety of embedding rules in multiple areas of an optimization system is<br>
the order in which rules will be applied. For example, if a pipe attached to an engine<br>
is defined in the base model by an equation that makes an exit diameter equal to an<br>
entrance diameter and the pipe is defined in a strategy such that the exit and<br><br>
entrance diameters may vary, then the priority or order of execution of those rules<br>
will determine whether a straight pipe will be required in the optimization or whether<br>
a non-straight pipe may result.<br>
A base model or a base design configuration may include starting definitions<br>
of attributes or components to be modified by rules to create an optimized design. A<br>
"best model" may be, for example, a model that most closely approximates one or<br>
more specified values when the directive of the goal is to match those values, a<br>
model that provides the highest resulting value when the goal is to maximize that<br>
value, or a model that provides the lowest resulting value when the goal is to<br>
minimize that value. The base design may include all attributes necessary to<br>
simulate the design. Design attributes may furthermore be stored in a design<br>
attribute database. The design utilized in the examples herein is an engine design<br>
so that the base design configuration in those engine examples is referred to as a<br>
"base engine." Thus, those attributes may include dimensional data such as, for<br>
example, intake plenum dimensions, intake pipe length and diameter, exhaust pipe<br>
length and diameter, intake valve diameter, exhaust valve diameter, and cylinder<br>
length and diameter. Those attributes may also include other data such as, for<br>
example, sensed data including intake air pressure, exhaust air pressure, and<br>
throttle position. Attributes may furthermore be grouped logically by, for example,<br>
component such that an exhaust pipe length and an exhaust pipe diameter that are<br>
commonly used in combination may be grouped to define an exhaust pipe<br>
component. Those components may then be assigned names such that all the<br>
attributes for a component are grouped under a unique engine component name.<br>
The present optimization may then vary selected attributes and simulate operation of<br>
an engine having those varying attributes to achieve one or more goals.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a Design Optimization 100 of the present invention. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, the Design Optimization 100 includes 2 phases of<br>
operation, Design and Execution. The Design includes Specifying Goals 102,<br>
Specifying Variables 104, Specifying Constraints 106, Specifying Design of<br>
Experiments 108 and Specifying Optimizations 110. The Execution Phase includes<br>
Exploration 112 and Solution 114.<br><br>
At 102, an objective that contains one or more goals of the optimization may<br>
be specified. The objective may include a definition of the desired result of<br>
optimization. Goals may have at least three component parts: a characteristic, a<br>
directive, and a value. Each characteristic may further be an entity that is to be<br>
optimized, such as for example a performance characteristic of an engine. The<br>
directive instructs as to what is desired to be accomplished with the characteristic.<br>
For example, a directive may be an instruction to maximize the value of the<br>
characteristic, minimize the value of the characteristic, or match one or more desired<br>
values of the characteristic. The value may provide an objective standard to<br>
compare the extent to which each design configuration approaches the desired<br>
result. In certain situations, goals that are minimized or maximized may not have an<br>
associated value, whereas goals that are to be matched typically would have at least<br>
one associated value.<br>
The goal of the present example is the singular goal of achieving maximum<br>
power through the range of engine operation specified in the test procedure. Thus,<br>
the characteristic is power and the directive is to maximize that power.<br>
The test procedure may, for example, specify a range of operation, a stepwise<br>
increment through the range, a number of engine cycles to simulate at each rpm<br>
step, a fuel utilized by the engine, a throttle position, and ambient conditions. The<br>
range may be, for example, 5000 rotations per minute (rpm) to 10,000 rpm and the<br>
increment may be 1000 rpm steps throughout the range. The fuel may be, for<br>
example, gasoline or diesel. Ambient conditions include air temperature, air<br>
pressure, and humidity at intake and exhaust points.<br>
As has been mentioned, goals may be minimized, maximized, or matched to<br>
a desired value or a set of values. Where matching is desired, the value associated<br>
with the goal may be matched to, for example, a curve or set of values defining a<br>
curve. Goals may also be utilized as limits on the design. For example, a goal may<br>
be set with a high limit, a low limit, or a band having both high and low limits.<br>
Moreover, more than one goal may be established for a simulation. Thus, for<br>
example, a user may attempt to match a desired power curve while setting a<br>
particular high limit on carbon monoxide in the exhaust of an engine. In that<br><br>
example, all results producing a carbon monoxide level greater than the limit will be<br>
disregarded and the best fits to the power curve having a carbon monoxide level<br>
below the limit will be provided as results.<br>
The high limit is the specification of a value or set of values for a parameter<br>
above which a design configuration is unacceptable. A high limit may, for example<br>
be placed on a parameter such as fuel consumption to prevent a resulting design<br>
from being overly inefficient as to fuel consumption. If the high limit is exceeded at<br>
any point, then the simulation may be considered to have failed for that variable set.<br>
The low limit is the specification of a value or set of values for a parameter<br>
below which a design configuration is unacceptable. A low limit may, for example,<br>
be placed on a parameter such as power to prevent a resulting design from having<br>
too little power. If a variable set produces a value that is below the low limit at any<br>
point during the simulation, then the simulation may be considered to have failed for<br>
that variable set.<br>
A limit band includes a high and low limit, such that if the high limit is<br>
exceeded for a set of variables at any point during the simulation or the variable set<br>
produces a value that is below the low limit at any point during the simulation, then<br>
the simulation may be considered to have failed for that variable set.<br>
A failed variable set typically is not used in the ranking of variable sets to<br>
determine the best result.<br>
A strategy is a process used to obtain an objective, A strategy typically <br>
includes one or more variables and may or may not contain one or more constraints. <br>
At 104, the variables to be optimized are specified. "Optimized" variables are<br>
those variables that are to be varied in the optimization simulations in order to<br>
accomplish the goals. Two variables are to be optimized in the embodiment<br>
described as an example herein: exhaust pipe length and exhaust pipe diameter.<br>
An initial value of each variable to be optimized may be assigned. Boundaries of<br>
values for which the simulation is to be run may then set. It has been determined for<br>
the present example that an exhaust pipe having a length of between 100 mm and<br><br>
1000 mm is desired to fit the vehicle that the engine is operating. It has also been<br>
determined for the present application that an exhaust pipe having a diameter of<br>
between 100 mm and 200 mm is desired to fit the vehicle. Since only exhaust pipes<br>
having a length between 100 and 1000 mm will be considered, the boundaries for<br>
exhaust pipe length are 100 mm and 1000 mm. Similarly, the boundaries for<br>
exhaust pipe diameter are 100 mm and 200 mm. Where each variable represents<br>
an axis of a grid, the area encompassed by the boundaries may be viewed<br>
graphically and referred to as a "design space."<br>
The number of engines to be simulated may be limited, for practical purposes,<br>
by use of tolerances with variables or attributes that are permitted to vary during<br>
optimization. A tolerance may be set at a minimum increment desired for a variable<br>
such that variable values to be simulated will be limited to values falling at tolerance<br>
points. Without use of a tolerance, an infinite number of designs to be simulated<br>
would exist in any design space. By utilizing tolerances, infinitely small steps in the<br>
design space are eliminated and a finite number of simulations is forced to exist in a<br>
design space. When tolerances are used, variable values to be simulated are<br>
rounded to the nearest tolerance point so that values falling between those points<br>
are not simulated. A design tolerance may be equal to a manufacturing tolerance<br>
but may also be simply the amount of each step that a designer wishes the<br>
optimization to consider. For example, it may be desired to consider exhaust pipes<br>
in lengths having 10 mm increments and diameters having 1 mm increments. Thus,<br>
a tolerance for exhaust pipe length may be set at 10 mm and a tolerance for exhaust<br>
pipe diameter may be set at 1 mm. Graphically, the bounded design space may now<br>
be viewed as a grid having points located on every multiple of each tolerance. With<br>
regard to tolerances, a global tolerance may be set that is based upon a function of<br>
that variable such as the magnitude of the variable. Where desired, however, the<br>
tolerance for a variable may be set to any value. Tolerances may also be offset so<br>
that tolerance points may begin at other than zero or another multiple of the<br>
tolerance. Thus, for example, an exhaust pipe may be desired to be considered in<br>
10 mm increments beginning a 25 mm, thereby providing a tolerance offset. The<br>
exhaust pipe lengths to be considered would then be in 10 mm increments from 25<br>
mm (e.g., 25 mm, 35 mm, 45 mm, etc.).<br><br>
Optimization having variables set at tolerances also provides a natural<br>
termination for the optimization program. Once all tolerance points around a point<br>
from which optimization is occurring have been simulated and do not yield a better<br>
value of the characteristic, the optimization may be terminated. Use of tolerance<br>
based simulation, furthermore, beneficially reduces the number of simulations run<br>
because variable values that are near each other are rounded to the same tolerance<br>
point and simulation of the same point need not be performed twice. Rather, the<br>
present invention is capable of recognizing that a variable set to be simulated is the<br>
same as a variable set previously simulated and so does not simulate that same<br>
variable set a second time.<br>
At 106, constraints, including parametric equations, are specified. An initial<br>
design attribute may be defined as a constant value or by a parametric equation.<br>
Parametric equations are referred to herein as a type of constraint. A parametric<br>
equation defines an attribute in terms of one or more other attributes. An attribute<br>
that is defined by a parametric equation may not be optimized. It may, however,<br>
change as variables being optimized change. For example, the entrance diameter of<br>
a pipe may be defined as being equal to the diameter of a port to which it connects.<br>
The pipe entrance diameter will, therefore, vary as the port size varies. Alternately, a<br>
parametric equation could define the geometry of a component, such as a parallel<br>
pipe, by equating the exit diameter to the entrance diameter. Thus it is assured that<br>
only configurations in which inlet and outlet of the pipe are equal will be considered.<br>
As another example of a parametric equation, the stroke of an engine may be based<br>
on the displacement and bore stroke ratio of the engine.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, variable sets for design<br>
configurations in the design space are simulated in two steps. The first step, called<br>
exploration herein, simulates variable sets in various regions of the design space<br>
and the second step, called optimization herein, simulates design configurations in<br>
the most promising regions of the design space. In exploration, a small number of<br>
variable sets are selected to determine which region or regions in the design space<br>
are most promising. Thus for example, three values for each variable may be<br>
selected so as to be dispersed evenly across a range of values to be considered for<br>
each variable. In optimization, design configurations adjacent to the most promising<br><br>
design configurations explored in exploration are simulated to find optimum solutions<br>
in those regions.<br>
At 108, attributes for a design of experiments are specified. The design of<br>
experiments attributes may determine how many design configurations will be<br>
simulated in exploration 112 and optimization 114. Design of experiments attributes<br>
may include a number of levels to be explored for each variable, the number of best<br>
runs desired for further consideration, the number of other regions desired for further<br>
consideration, and a number of runs limit. The level is a number of values for each<br>
variable that are to be considered during exploration. Viewed graphically with each<br>
variable defining an axis on a graph beginning with the lowest value to be considered<br>
and ending with the highest value to be considered, levels are a number of points to<br>
be simulated on each axis in exploration 112. The number of solutions to be<br>
simulated for exploration 112 may, thus, be the product of the number of levels for<br>
each variable.<br>
Global or local levels may be set for the variables when specifying the design<br>
of experiments 108. When global levels are assigned for all variables, the same<br>
number of values are considered for each variable. For example, a global level of 3<br>
may be provided by default. Where three values are selected for each variable, the<br>
number of design configurations that will be considered in exploration is 3n, where n<br>
is equal to the number of variables in the design configuration.<br>
When local levels are set for each variable, the number of values to be<br>
considered during exploration is selected individually for each variable. Furthermore,<br>
a global level may be provided as a default and overriding local levels may be<br>
specified for one or more of the variables being explored. A level of zero may also<br>
be specified such that exploration 112 is disabled for one or more variables.<br>
Alternately, values may be specified by a user for consideration in exploration 112 or<br>
another technique may be utilized to select the values to be used in exploration 112.<br>
A number of best runs may be specified to instruct optimization 114 as to how<br>
many design configurations most closely approximate the goal are to be retained.<br>
Those best design configurations often lie close to each other in a single region. The<br>
best design configurations may, however, lie in disparate parts of the design space<br><br>
and may result from optimizing more than one design configuration found in<br>
exploration 112.<br>
It may be desired that optimum design configurations in one or more local<br>
optimum regions of the design space (regions not containing the best design<br>
configuration) be provided. For example, solutions in a local optimum region may be<br>
close enough to the goal to satisfy a designer and may be substantially more cost<br>
effective to implement. Thus, a number of other regions may be specified to provide<br>
optimum designs so that design configurations in local optimum regions are also<br>
provided by optimization 114.<br>
A number of runs limit may also be specified such that a limit is placed on the<br>
number of design configurations to be simulated. The number of runs limit may be<br>
accomplished by randomly selecting design configurations to be simulated from the<br>
total number of design configurations that could be simulated. A random number<br>
seed may, furthermore be specified in a computer system so that the same design<br>
configurations may be simulated by choosing the same seed and different design<br>
configurations may be simulated by selecting a different seed.<br>
Optimizations are specified at 110. In optimization, adjacent design<br>
configurations may be simulated by stepping from a base design simulation to<br>
adjacent design configurations to find optimum solutions in each region selected in<br>
exploration 112. In the optimization specification phase, a determination of whether<br>
and how variables are to be combined in optimization 114 is made. As has been<br>
explained hereinbefore, variables may be optimized individually or in combination.<br>
Steps may be applied during optimization 114 as "individuals" where only one<br>
variables is changed when simulating adjacent design configurations or as<br>
"combinations" where a combination of at least two variables are changed when<br>
simulating adjacent design configurations. Figure 7a illustrates an example wherein<br>
variables are changed individually, creating four new design configurations to be<br>
simulated and Figure 7b illustrates an example wherein variables are changed in<br>
combination, creating eight new design configurations to be simulated. As may be<br>
seen by that example, many more design configurations are presented for<br><br>
consideration by the optimization system when parameters are considered in<br>
combination than individually.<br>
It may be noted that all variables may be combined or uncombined or subsets<br>
of the variables may be combined in one or more combinations.<br>
In addition, step and step delta start and end factors may be specified, a<br>
threshold may be specified, an optimization methodology may be specified, and a<br>
limit on the number of runs for each pass of the optimization may be specified. Step<br>
size may be defined for each variable. A step may define an area on a grid, above<br>
and/or below a base point, that will be considered in optimization. One useful step<br>
size is the distance between exploration points, which causes optimization to form a<br>
base point at each surrounding exploration point. Step delta start and end factors<br>
may be defined as percentages of the step or portions of the step. A step delta start<br>
factor may define the distance from a base point, as a portion of a step, at which the<br>
first optimization pass will occur. A step delta end factor may define the distance<br>
from a base point, as a portion of a step, at which the last optimization pass will<br>
occur if the optimization is not terminated by other means. Moreover, one or more<br>
variables may be eliminated from the optimization 114 because those variables were<br>
only necessary for exploration 112.<br>
The step delta factors may be used by the optimization to determine a new<br>
value for a variable set based on a portion of the distance between two adjacent<br>
points on the exploration grid. The threshold may be evaluated at each pass to<br>
determine whether the optimization is complete. The optimization may thus<br>
terminate upon reaching a threshold or may terminate prior to reaching a threshold<br>
for other reasons. For example, another reason that optimization may terminate is<br>
because design configurations for all tolerances in the design space surrounding the<br>
base point have been simulated and no better result was found.<br>
The optimization methodology for the present embodiment is based on a<br>
steepest decent analysis. Alternately, a downhill simplex or other form of analysis<br>
may be utilized. Downhill simplex does not allow any combinations and may not<br>
perform ideally in combination with tolerances, since it depends upon small changes<br>
to keep it progressing.<br><br>
As was previously discussed, a limit for the number of runs to be simulated in<br>
each pass may be specified if such a limit is desired and a random number seed<br>
may be specified in case the limit is exceeded to limit the number of optimizations<br>
performed.<br>
During exploration 112, the design space may be explored combining all the<br>
variables based upon the levels of each variable or other specified values. A<br>
baseline simulation may be run initially. The baseline simulation may be run for<br>
comparison to other simulated configurations. Thus, for example, an engine for a<br>
vehicle may be optimized for power by varying exhaust pipe length and diameter.<br>
The simulation may utilize values from the baseline simulation that define a complete<br>
engine for all design configurations while varying values for exhaust pipe length and<br>
diameter only. Thus, if an engine to be optimized is currently utilizing an exhaust<br>
pipe that is 700 mm long and 150 mm in diameter, power may be determined for that<br>
configuration over a desired range of engine speeds for the baseline simulation. The<br>
range of engine speeds for this example will be 5000 to 10,000 rpm. The result of<br>
the baseline simulation may then be compared to other variations of exhaust pipe<br>
length and diameter examined during the optimization.<br>
It is not necessary, however, to run a baseline simulation. Simulation results<br>
may simply be ranked to determine which configurations of the variables are best.<br>
Exploration 112 may calculate the result (in the present example engine power) at<br>
the various defined points within the boundaries set for the variables (in the present<br>
example exhaust pipe lengths from 100 mm to 1000 mm and diameter from 100 mm<br>
to 200 mm). Those results may then be ranked to determine which configurations of<br>
the variables provide the best results.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a sample set of simulations of exhaust pipe length and<br>
diameter graphically. Power performance is depicted topographically on a<br>
landscape plane with the minimum exhaust pipe length of 100 mm set as a left<br>
boundary, the maximum exhaust pipe length of 1000 mm set as a right boundary,<br>
the minimum exhaust pipe diameter of 100 mm set as a lower boundary and the<br>
maximum exhaust pipe diameter of 200 mm set as an upper boundary. In Figure 2,<br><br>
exploration was performed in fine resolution to demonstrate an example of the<br>
values of the power contour in the design space.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a method of determining combined values 230 for<br>
exploration 112 of the present invention. The method 230 operates visually to create<br>
a two-dimensional grid corresponding to two variables. It should be recognized,<br>
however, that the present invention may be utilized to optimize any number of<br>
variables. The range for each variable in the method 230 illustrated is equal to the<br>
maximum boundary value for that variable less the minimum boundary value for that<br>
variable. At 232, a counter "N" is set to 1. As will be seen at 252 and 254, that<br>
counter will be incremented until it reaches the level set for the first variable which, in<br>
the embodiment illustrated, is exhaust pipe length ("Len"). At 234, a step is<br>
calculated that divides the range for length into equal portions. A variable value for<br>
the first division of length is calculated when 236 is first executed. Thus, graphically,<br>
the distance on an X-axis from the minimum length into the length range for the first<br>
design of experiments point is determined at 236. The distance on a Y-axis from the<br>
minimum diameter to that first design of experiments point is next determined to<br>
pinpoint the first design of experiments point. Thus, a nested loop for exhaust pipe<br>
diameter is entered at 238. At 238, a counter "M" is set to 1. As will be seen at 248<br>
and 250, that counter will be incremented until it reaches the level set for the second<br>
variable which, in the embodiment illustrated, is exhaust pipe diameter ("Dia"). At<br>
240, a step is calculated that divides the range for diameter into equal portions. A<br>
variable value for the first division of diameter is calculated when 242 is first<br>
executed. Thus, in the present embodiment that considers only two variables, the<br>
exhaust pipe length and exhaust pipe diameter of the first design of experiments<br>
point to be simulated is the intersection of the length resulting from step 236 and the<br>
diameter resulting from step 242.<br>
In a certain embodiment wherein duplicate variable values may be produced<br>
by the method described in Figure 3, variable values to be simulated are stored in a<br>
database or table. After each iteration, wherein a new set of variables to be used to<br>
run a simulation is developed, the variable set associated with the simulation may be<br>
compared to the variable sets stored in the database. Thus, if a variable set already<br>
exists in the database, the duplicate variable set may be discarded so as not to<br><br>
waste simulation resources on an additional simulation of the variable set.<br>
Therefore, at 244, the length and diameter determined at 236 are 242 are compared<br>
to values previously calculated and stored in a database. If the length and diameter<br>
values match previous values, the current values are not stored and the method<br>
returns to 248 to calculate the next design of experiments point. If, however, the<br>
length and diameter values do not match any saved in the database, then the current<br>
design of experiments values are saved in the database at 246 for future simulation.<br>
At 248, if counter "M" is less than the level selected for the second variable<br>
"diameter," then counter "M" is incremented at 250 and the process returns to 242 to<br>
calculate the desired diameter value for the next step. When counter "M" is equal to<br>
the level selected for second variable "diameter" then the process proceeds to 252.<br>
At 252, if counter "N" is less than the level selected for first variable "length," then<br>
counter "N" is incremented at 254 and the process returns to 236 to calculate the<br>
desired length value for the next step. When counter "N" is equal to the level<br>
selected for first variable "length" then the process ends at 256.<br>
It should be recognized that values calculated in the design of experiments<br>
value determination method 230 of Figure 3 need not be saved in a database but<br>
may, for example, be simulated immediately after they are calculated. The method<br>
described in connection with Figure 3, however, beneficially eliminates duplicate<br>
simulation. It should also be noted that when the loop for the first variable is<br>
incremented, it is not necessary to recalculate the diameter points because the<br>
diameter values will match those calculated in the first pass. Thus a recursive<br>
algorithm, may beneficially be employed to efficiently determine the design of<br>
experiments points to be simulated.<br>
Figure 4 depicts a tolerance determination method 130 that assures the value<br>
of a variable to be utilized in a particular run is within the desired range and of the<br>
desired magnitude to fall on a tolerance point. Where, as in the present<br>
embodiment, there are multiple variables being considered in each solution, the<br>
method of selecting parameters associated with a variable 130 may have to be<br>
performed once for each variable being considered. At 132, a desired starting value<br>
is input into the tolerance method. At 134-142 the tolerance method 130 assures<br><br>
that the input starting value is not greater than the maximum boundary set for that<br>
variable and at 144-152 the tolerance method 130 assures that the input starting<br>
value is not less than the minimum boundary set for that variable.<br>
At 134, the starting value is checked to determine whether it is greater than<br>
the maximum boundary for that variable. If the starting value is greater than the<br>
maximum boundary set for that variable then the starting value is given the value of<br>
the maximum boundary at 136. At 138, the starting value is set equal to the integer<br>
of the starting value divided by the tolerance and that value is multiplied by the<br>
tolerance. A value other than an integer may alternately be specified at 138. Thus,<br>
at 138 the starting value is set at a multiple of the tolerance. As an example, if an<br>
exhaust pipe length of 1005 mm is input, the maximum length to be considered is<br>
1000 mm, and the tolerance is 10 mm, then the starting value will be set equal to the<br>
1000 mm maximum length at 136. The integer of (1000 mm /10 mm) * 10 mm is<br>
1000 mm. Thus it is confirmed that 1000 mm is a multiple of the tolerance of 10 mm.<br>
Where a rounded integer function is used at 138 and a boundary is not set at<br>
a multiple of the tolerance, it is possible for the result of the equation of 138 to fall<br>
outside of the boundary. Therefore, at 140 and 142, the method will subtract one<br>
tolerance from the starting value if the starting value is greater than the maximum<br>
boundary set.<br>
At 144, the starting value is checked to determine whether it is less than the<br>
minimum boundary for that variable. If the starting value is less than the minimum<br>
boundary set for that variable then the starting value is given the value of the<br>
minimum boundary at 146. At 148, the starting value is set equal to the integer of<br>
the starting value divided by the tolerance and that value is multiplied by the<br>
tolerance. Thus, at 148 the starting value is always set at a multiple of the tolerance.<br>
At 150 and 152, the method will add one tolerance from the starting value if the<br>
starting value is less than the minimum boundary set and at 154 the tolerance<br>
method terminates.<br>
During exploration 112 sets of values for the variables spread evenly within<br>
the boundaries may be generated and simulations run for each of those sets. In the<br>
present embodiment, all sets of values to be explored are calculated first and then<br><br>
each simulation is run. A benefit to that ordering is that multiple simulations may be<br>
run simultaneously. That ordering is particularly advantageous where the<br>
simulations are performed on a network of computers wherein multiple processors<br>
are available to run simulations simultaneously. Simulations may, however,<br>
alternately be run as the variable values are determined.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a method of performing exploration 112 of the present<br>
invention. At 202, values for variables at various design of experiments points within<br>
the boundaries are determined. Those points are typically located grid-like between<br>
the boundaries set for each variable to arrive at a sampling of solutions across the<br>
entire range of values to be considered. At 204, a solution is run on each design of<br>
experiments point and a result for the goal is determined for each of those design of<br>
experiments points. At 206, the solutions are ranked with the solution most closely<br>
approaching the goal ranked first and the solution farthest from the goal ranked last.<br>
The number of best solutions desired are collected at 210. At 212, the best regional<br>
solutions are determined by, for example, using a steepest climb analysis. The<br>
steepest climb analysis includes (i) determining the steepest climb at each point, and<br>
(ii) creating a collection of all points that did not climb toward any adjacent point. A<br>
climb occurs where an adjacent point has a more desirable result. The steepest<br>
climb occurs toward the point having the most desirable result of all adjacent points.<br>
At 218, any points that were determined to be best solutions at 210 are eliminated<br>
and the best regional solutions are ranked. Next, at 218 a number of regional best<br>
solutions equal to the number of other regional solutions desired is selected.<br>
If the number of runs created in exploration 112 exceeds the number of runs<br>
limit, then variable sets are either selected or deselected until the number of<br>
simulations to be run is equal to the runs limit. Selection or de-selection may be<br>
based on a randomization. Moreover, the randomization may be seed based such<br>
that the results are repeatable or modifiable as desired.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an embodiment of optimization 114. The term "base point"<br>
will be utilized to describe a point from which a solution pass will occur. Optimization<br>
114 simulates design configurations adjacent to base points and selects the best<br>
design configuration. That best design configuration for the pass is the design<br><br>
configuration that results in a value or values most nearly approximating the desired<br>
goal value or values. The best design configuration from a pass then becomes the<br>
base design for the next optimization pass. If none of the generated design<br>
configurations in a pass improve on the base design configuration then design<br>
configurations in the design space nearer to the base design will be simulated in the<br>
next pass. When a new base engine is selected for the next pass, the process is<br>
termed "migration." When the same base engine is retained for the next pass and<br>
simulation of design configurations nearer that base design are performed, the<br>
process is termed "shrink." Thus, in migration, the base engine is moved from one<br>
location on the grid to another so that additional engines may be generated around<br>
that improved engine. In shrink, the base engine is maintained in its current location<br>
and alternative engines nearer to that base engine are generated.<br>
Step size is based on the step delta specified during specification of<br>
optimization 110. The optimization may continue the process of migration and shrink<br>
until a step delta end factor has been reached or design configurations for all<br>
tolerances adjacent to the base point have been simulated and no better result of the<br>
characteristic was found. Thus, for example, the step delta start factor may be 64%<br>
of the step delta and the step delta end factor may be 1 % of the step delta. Designs<br>
may, thereby, be simulated 64% of the step from the base point initially, then 32% of<br>
the step from the base point, 16% of the step from the base point, 8% of the step<br>
from the base point, 4% of the step from the base point, 2% of the step from the<br>
base point, and 1 % of the step from the base point as shrinkage passes occur. As<br>
has previously been noted, during migration, engine designs from previous passes<br>
that overlap on the current pass may not be selected for regeneration since they<br>
were previously generated.<br>
The optimization begins at 302 by setting a shrink factor to the step delta start<br>
factor previously specified. It has been found through experimentation that a first<br>
pass having a shrink factor that is equal to 64% of the step size between exploration<br>
points is beneficial and so a 64% shrink factor will be used in the following example<br>
and the distance between exploration points for each variable will be used as the<br>
step size for each variable.<br><br>
At 304, values for simulations propagating from the current base point are<br>
determined. As may be seen in Figures 7a and 7b, each solution pass may be<br>
performed individually or in combination. Figure 7a illustrates a solutions pass<br>
occurring for length and diameter variables individually, while Figure 7b illustrates a<br>
solutions pass occurring for length and diameter variables simultaneously. In the<br>
present two variable example, performing a solutions pass on the variables<br>
individually would cause the simulator to select additional values to be simulated that<br>
are adjacent to the base point at (i) the base point length value and the base point<br>
diameter value plus 64% of an exploration step in the diameter direction, which may<br>
be referred to as a plus model for diameter, (ii) the base point length value and the<br>
base point diameter value minus 64% of an exploration step in the diameter<br>
direction, which may be referred to as a minus model for diameter, (iii) the base point<br>
length value plus 64% of an exploration step in the length direction and the base<br>
point diameter value, which may be referred to as a plus model for length, and (iv)<br>
the base point length value minus 64% of an exploration step in the length direction<br>
and the base point diameter value, which may be referred to as a minus model for<br>
length, as plotted on Figure 7a. In the present example, performing the solutions<br>
pass on the variables in combination would cause the simulator to select the<br>
additional values selected in an individual solutions pass and additional values at, (i)<br>
the base point length value plus 64% of an exploration step in the length direction<br>
and the base point diameter value plus 64% of an exploration step in the diameter<br>
direction, referred to as a plus-plus model, (ii) the base point length value plus 64%<br>
of an exploration step in the length direction and the base point diameter value<br>
minus 64% of an exploration step in the diameter direction, referred to as a plus-<br>
minus model, (iii) the base point length value minus 64% of an exploration step in the<br>
length direction and the base point diameter value plus 64% of an exploration step in<br>
the diameter direction, referred to as a minus-plus model, and (iv) the base point<br>
length value minus 64% of an exploration step in the length direction and the base<br>
point diameter value minus 64% of an exploration step in the diameter direction,<br>
referred to as a minus-minus model, as plotted on Figure 7b.<br>
It is noted that where two or more variables are considered in a simulation,<br>
any two or more variables may be combined while other variables are considered<br><br>
individually or separately in combination. Furthermore, the present invention<br>
contemplates dynamic combination of variables based on the degree of<br>
improvement in the result from the best solution of the previous pass. The dynamic<br>
combination could include, for example, any variable that changed in the best result<br>
 of the previous pass combined with other unchanged variables. Alternately, any or<br>
all of the variables that changed in the best result of the previous pass may be<br>
combined. Moreover, any or all of the variables that changed in the last pass may<br>
be combined with any or all of the unchanged variables. For example, each<br>
unchanged variable may be combined with a combination of any or all of the<br>
variables that changed in the previous pass.<br>
At 306, the tolerance method illustrated in Figure 4 is applied to all variables.<br>
As was previously discussed, variable sets that have been simulated may be<br>
stored in a database and newly determined variable sets may be compared to those<br>
previously simulated variable sets so that duplicate variable sets may be discarded<br>
and not simulated for a second time. Thus, at 308, the variable sets determined at<br>
304 and 306 are compared to variable sets already simulated and at 310 non-<br>
duplicative variable sets are saved to the database.<br>
At 311, if the number of runs created in an optimization pass exceeds the<br>
number of runs limit, then variable sets are either selected or de-selected until the<br>
number of simulations to be run is equal to the runs limit. Selection or de-selection<br>
may be based on a randomization. Moreover, the randomization may be seed<br>
based such that the results are repeatable or modifiable as desired.<br>
At 312, a determination is made as to whether any additional simulations exist<br>
to be simulated around the current base point. Because the present embodiment is<br>
tolerance based, as solutions passes are performed a time may arise when all<br>
multiples of the tolerance around a base point have been explored. When all<br>
tolerance multiples around a base point have been explored, the solutions process<br>
will proceed to 322. If all tolerance multiples around a base point have not been<br>
explored the solutions process will proceed to 314.<br><br>
At 314, simulations are run on each variable value set in a pass, and at 316<br>
the latest simulation results are compared to previous simulation results to find the<br>
best simulation result to that time.<br>
At 318, a determination is made as to whether one of the results of the last<br>
solutions pass is better than the previous best result and is greater than the previous<br>
best result by more than the threshold. If one of the results in the last solutions pass<br>
is the best result, then the base point is reset to the new point having the best result<br>
at 320 and the process returns to 304. If none of the results of the last solutions<br>
pass is the best result, the solutions process proceeds to 322. At 322, the current<br>
percentage is divided by two or some other factor and at 324 a decision is made as<br>
to whether the current percentage is less than the step delta end factor. If the<br>
current percentage is greater than or equal to the step delta end factor, the process<br>
returns to 304 to make another solutions pass at, for example, half the distance from<br>
the base point. If the current percentage is less than the step delta end factor the<br>
optimization terminates at 326. Of course, terminating at a percentage of the step<br>
delta end factor is not necessary, but it beneficially prevents simulations from<br>
continuing past a point where the benefit derived from further simulation is minimal.<br>
The optimization results may be normalized. For example, results may be<br>
normalized to account for differences in the magnitude of each goal. Thus a<br>
normalized result might be based on the percent of the average result. Results may<br>
also be weighted so that one goal is given a greater weighting than another where<br>
goals are of varying importance.<br>
One technique that may be used in connection with goals is referred to herein<br>
as "match design." Match design is a specification of a set of values, such as power<br>
or fuel consumption, for evaluating the results of a simulation by computing the least<br>
squares fit to produce an error value. Error values may furthermore be normalized,<br>
for example, to account for differences in the magnitude of the results for each goal.<br>
Thus a normalized error value might be based on the percent that the average<br>
results vary from a desired match. Error values may also be weighted such that one<br>
error value is given a greater weighting than another where goals are of varying<br>
importance.<br><br>
Dynamic priority is an automatic process that the optimization uses to<br>
determine its own priority in relation to other optimizations that may be running<br>
concurrently. Dynamic priority could, for example, be the negative of the number of<br>
runs created in a pass, thus giving higher priority to a pass having a smaller amount<br>
of runs. In an embodiment, marking an optimization as done provides a way for the<br>
user to abort the optimization.<br>
After completion of an optimization, the optimization system may<br>
automatically determine the sensitivity of each variable. That may be accomplished<br>
by moving one tolerance step, or another desired amount, to the positive and one<br>
tolerance step, or another desired amount, to the negative for each variable and<br>
performing a simulation at each of those points. The sensitivity may then be<br>
calculated by adding the difference between the resulting goal value at the optimum<br>
value and the resulting goal value at one step to the negative to the difference<br>
between the resulting goal value at the optimum value and the resulting goal value at<br>
one step to the positive for of each variable (i.e., I∆1I + I∆2I).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a base model selection expert<br>
system may be employed to assist in selecting a base model having attributes and<br>
the same or a different expert system may be employed to assist in selecting an<br>
optimization strategy for optimizing that model. Related to selecting base engine<br>
attributes, engine attributes may be stored in an engine attribute database portion of<br>
the knowledgebase. Those attributes may include dimensional data such as, for<br>
example, intake plenum dimensions, intake pipe length and diameter, exhaust pipe<br>
length and diameter, intake valve diameter, exhaust valve diameter, and cylinder<br>
length and diameter. Those attributes may also include other data such as, for<br>
example, sensed data including intake air pressure, exhaust air pressure, and<br>
throttle position. Attributes may furthermore be grouped logically by, for example,<br>
component such that an exhaust pipe length and an exhaust pipe diameter that are<br>
commonly used in combination may be grouped to define an exhaust pipe<br>
component. Those components may then be assigned names such that all the<br>
attributes for a component are grouped under a unique engine component name.<br>
Components may furthermore be combined into groups. For example, eight<br>
cylinders in an eight cylinder engine may be combined into a group of cylinders.<br><br>
Attributes or components defining a variety of engine configurations may be<br>
stored within the engine attribute database so that a variety of preconfigured engines<br>
may be available for optimization. For example, attributes or components for a two-<br>
stroke single cylinder engine may be defined as well as attributes or components for<br>
a four-stroke twelve cylinder engine. Thus, the expert system may assist in defining<br>
a wide variety of engines or other models.<br>
Engine attributes or components may, furthermore, be identified by the expert<br>
system so that appropriate attributes or components may be grouped to define a<br>
working engine of the desired type. For example, where a four cylinder engine<br>
having two liters of displacement is desired, attributes or components for an engine<br>
having those characteristics and that is known to function well may be grouped by<br>
the expert system to create a definition of an engine that may be used for<br>
optimization. Because so many attributes may be involved in defining an engine, it<br>
will be assumed in the following examples that all attributes have been logically<br>
grouped as components. Thus components, each of which may contain more than<br>
one attribute, will be combined to create an engine definition in each example.<br>
An initial engine attribute may be defined as a constant value or by a<br>
parametric equation. A parametric equation defines an attribute in terms of one or<br>
more other attributes. For example, the entrance diameter of a pipe may be defined<br>
as being equal to the diameter of a port to which it connects. Alternately, the<br>
parametric equations could define the geometry of a component, such as a parallel<br>
pipe, by equating the exit diameter to the entrance diameter. As another example,<br>
the stroke of an engine may be based on the displacement and bore stroke ratio of<br>
the engine.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, an engine configuration expert<br>
system is employed to assist in selecting an initial engine configuration to be<br>
optimized. The engine configuration expert system may, for example, receive<br>
certain information that specifies aspects of an engine that is input by a user. The<br>
engine configuration expert system may recognize that a complete engine definition<br>
requires that more aspects of an engine be specified than were specified by the<br>
user. The engine configuration expert system may then specify additional engine<br><br>
aspects based on the aspects specified by the user. The engine configuration expert<br>
system may then provide a complete engine specification, based on the<br>
specifications provided by the user and including the additional aspects specified by<br>
the engine configuration expert system. Thus, in that embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a complete engine may be specified by the engine configuration expert<br>
system given only a partial specification by the user. The complete engine<br>
specification may then be optimized as desired by the user.<br>
The engine configuration expert system may select a model by comparing a<br>
value specified by the designer for a first attribute to values of that first attribute in<br>
the stored models and selecting each model having a first attribute value that<br>
matches the value specified for the first attribute. If a second attribute is specified by<br>
the designer, the value of that attribute may be compared to a second attribute in the<br>
base models that matched the first attribute. Additional attributes may be compared<br>
in similar manner and the model or models most closely matching the attributes<br>
specified by the designer may be returned as suggested base models.<br>
An objective, as used herein, includes a definition of the desired result of the<br>
expert system. An objective for an optimization may include one or more sub-<br>
objectives. Each sub-objective may furthermore include at least one goal and at<br>
least one test procedure that will be utilized to evaluate the results of the model with<br>
respect to the goals. Goals, might be, for example, results of engine operation, also<br>
known as engine output. Engine outputs include, for example, power, torque, and<br>
emissions of certain chemicals such as carbon monoxide. Goals may, thus, be set<br>
to minimize or maximize an engine output. Goals may furthermore be set to match<br>
an engine output to a desired value or a set of values forming, for example, a curve.<br>
Goals may also be set as limits on the engine to be designed. Where limit goals are<br>
set, the goal may be set as a high limit, a low limit, or a band having both high and<br>
low limits.<br>
Thus, for example, a user may attempt to match a desired power curve while<br>
setting a particular high limit on carbon monoxide in the engine exhaust. In that<br>
example, all results producing a carbon monoxide level greater than the limit will be<br><br>
disregarded and the best fits to the power curve having a carbon monoxide level<br>
below the limit may be provided as results.<br>
Each objective created may be saved along with a genealogical link to its<br>
previous version, if there is one, in a knowledgebase so that it can be reused. Thus,<br>
objectives in the knowledgebase may continually increase and improve.<br>
Another expert system that may be used in conjunction with the engine<br>
configuration expert system or separately from the engine configuration system is a<br>
strategic expert system. The strategic expert system selects a strategy for<br>
optimizing a model. The strategic expert system may, for example, receive certain<br>
information that specifies attributes of optimization strategy for an engine that were<br>
input by a user. The strategic expert system may recognize that a complete<br>
optimization strategy requires that more aspects of a strategy be specified than were<br>
specified by the user. The strategic expert system may then specify additional<br>
optimization strategy attributes based on the attributes specified by the user. The<br>
strategic expert system may then provide a complete optimization strategy<br>
specification based on the attributes provided by the user and including the<br>
additional attributes specified by the strategic expert system. Thus, in that<br>
embodiment, a complete optimization strategy may be specified by the strategic<br>
expert system given only a partial specification by the user. The optimization<br>
strategy may then be utilized to optimize an engine specified by, for example, a user<br>
or the engine configuration expert system.<br>
In an embodiment of the expert system, a strategy includes variables,<br>
constraints, and an inference engine, the inference engine having attributes. Those<br>
variables and constraints and the inference engine furthermore define how base<br>
model attributes will be modified to accomplish the objective. Strategy attributes<br>
may also be grouped into strategy components to correspond with base model<br>
components. Model attributes that vary are referred to as "variables" herein. Each<br>
variable may include, for example, a minimum value, a maximum value, a tolerance,<br>
and levels. Where they exist, the minimum value and maximum value may be<br>
viewed as defining the boundaries of a design space. The tolerance, where<br>
specified, determines allowable values for the strategy attribute by forcing the base<br><br>
engine attribute value to be a multiple of the tolerance plus an offset where<br>
applicable. Constraints are base model attributes that vary by way of an equation<br>
with one or more variable values. Constraints allow a user to define design<br>
constraints such as, for example, maintaining a parallel pipe section if the entrance<br>
diameter is changed as part of the optimization, or maintaining an overall pipe length<br>
by adjusting a section length as a function of another section length. The expert<br>
system may furthermore be used during strategy development to obtain assistance<br>
in defining strategy attributes.<br>
Exploration, such as that illustrated in Figure 5, may be used to evaluate<br>
points distributed throughout the design space, and is typically followed by<br>
optimization of the exploration points having the desired results, such as the<br>
optimization illustrated in Figure 6. Levels, when they are utilized in exploration, may<br>
operate as described previously herein and may specify how many values the base<br>
engine attribute will have during an exploration of the design space if such<br>
exploration is desired. For example, if a variable has a total range of 250 mm and<br>
exploration is to assess the impact of that variable at increments of 25 mm then the<br>
levels would be set to 11. Alternately, if exploration were to assess the variable in<br>
increments of 50 mm then levels would be set to 6.<br>
If automatic calculation of levels is desired, which is referred to herein as<br>
"auto levels," the inference engine may compute the number of levels based on the<br>
maximum number of engines specified by the corresponding inference engine<br>
attribute. For example, consider an example wherein auto levels is selected, the<br>
maximum number of engines specified to be simulated in exploration is 256, and two<br>
variables are being optimized. In that example, the inference engine would compute<br>
that sixteen values should be considered for each variable in exploration. Sixteen<br>
values for the first variable times sixteen variables for the second variable equal a<br>
total of 256 points to be simulated in exploration.<br>
As an example, an exhaust pipe component having two variables, each<br>
having minimum and maximum values and a tolerance, is desired to be designed to<br>
match a power curve. A user may specify that exhaust pipe diameter and length<br>
attributes may be permitted to vary to match a desired power curve. Minimum and<br><br>
maximum values for exhaust pipe diameter and length may be used, for example, to<br>
match packaging requirements. A tolerance might be set to standard pipe diameter<br>
and length increments. Simulations may then be run to find an exhaust pipe that<br>
most clearly matches the desired power curve.<br>
Each strategy created may be saved along with a genealogical link in a<br>
knowledgebase and may be reused. The genealogical link may thus also be used to<br>
indicate previous uses of a strategy and the success of that strategy and its<br>
predecessors, in addition to who developed the strategy. Thus, strategies in the<br>
knowledgebase may continually increase and improve.<br>
In an embodiment of the engine design expert system, symbolic components<br>
may be utilized to relate one or more strategy attributes to one or more base design<br>
attributes. A benefit of the use of symbolic components is that strategies to be used<br>
in conjunction with a variable can be reused in connection with other variables or the<br>
same variable in another model configuration. Thus, for example, a range of valve<br>
diameters to be considered for an engine may be defined in the strategy attributes to<br>
be related to cylinder diameter and number of valves per cylinder. That strategy may<br>
then be used to optimize valve diameter for engines having a variety of sizes and<br>
configurations. Typically, once it has been determined that a strategy is successful<br>
in creating a design having a particular desired result, that strategy may be retained<br>
and reused to achieve that or similar desired results from other base designs.<br>
In an embodiment utilizing symbolic components, a strategy component is<br>
initially assigned a symbolic name. For example, an exhaust pipe may be assigned<br>
the symbolic name "Exhaust Runner!" "Exhaust RunnerT may then be linked to an<br>
initial engine component defining an exhaust pipe.<br>
The strategy component may, furthermore have one or more symbolic<br>
variables associated therewith. Those symbolic variables may be counterparts to<br>
the variables in a component of the base model with which the symbolic variable is<br>
associated. Thus, a symbolic component may define some or all variables in a base<br>
model component.<br><br>
Symbolic strategy components may be defined as absolute values, relative<br>
values, or percentage values. Absolute values may be entered as fixed numbers<br>
and cause the variable to be optimized only for values lying between the minimum<br>
and maximum absolute values. Relative values are amounts that are subtracted<br>
from the current value to arrive at the minimum value for optimization and added to<br>
the current value to arrive at the maximum value for optimization. Percent values<br>
may be a percentage of the current value to be subtracted from the current value to<br>
arrive at the minimum value and to be added to the current value to arrive at the<br>
maximum value.<br>
As an example of a use of a symbolic strategy component, a base engine<br>
component called "EXP1" may be selected to be utilized in the base model. That<br>
base engine component may define a straight exhaust pipe and may include a first<br>
attribute for exhaust pipe outlet diameter having a value of 100 mm, a second<br>
attribute for exhaust pipe inlet diameter having a value of 100 mm and a third<br>
attribute for exhaust pipe length having a value of 1000 mm.<br>
Where "EXP1" is desired to be optimized, a symbolic component containing<br>
an optimization strategy for optimizing an exhaust pipe may be created or selected if<br>
it already exists. The name of that symbolic strategy component may be, for<br>
example, "Exhaust Runner1," as used in the present example. "Exhaust Runner1,"<br>
in this example, specifies that the minimum outlet diameter is 25 mm, the maximum<br>
outlet diameter is 200 mm and the tolerance for outlet diameter is 5 mm so that only<br>
outlet diameters of 25 mm to 200 mm in increments of 5 mm may be simulated<br>
during optimization. "Exhaust Runner1" also specifies that inlet diameter is equal to<br>
outlet diameter so that only straight pipes will be simulated. Moreover, "Exhaust<br>
Runnerl" specifies that length is to be varied from the base engine value minus 50%<br>
of that value to the base engine value plus 50% of that value.<br>
If base engine component "EXP1" is linked to symbolic strategy component<br>
"Exhaust Runnerl," optimization may simulate the base engine attributes while<br>
varying exhaust outlet diameter from 25-200 mm, varying exhaust inlet diameter to<br>
be equal to the exhaust outlet diameter, and varying exhaust length from 500-1500<br>
mm.<br><br>
As may be seen, if "Exhaust Runneer1" were to be applied to a base engine<br>
having an exhaust outlet diameter of 100 mm, an exhaust inlet diameter of 75 mm,<br>
and an exhaust length of 2000 mm, optimization would still vary exhaust outlet<br>
diameter from 25-200 mm because those are set as absolute values in "Exhaust<br>
Runner)." Similarly, optimization would still vary exhaust inlet diameter to be equal<br>
to exhaust outlet diameter because exhaust inlet diameter is defined to be equal to<br>
exhaust outlet diameter in "Exhaust Runner1." Exhaust length, however, would vary<br>
from over different ranges, such as 1000-3000 mm for the base engine having a<br>
2000 mm length, because exhaust length strategy is defined in "Exhaust Runner1"<br>
as a percentage of the exhaust length value of the base engine.<br>
Thus, it may be seen that strategies may be defined symbolically so as to be<br>
applicable to various base models. Similarly, various strategies may be applied to a<br>
vase model to arrive at optimum solutions having different configurations.<br>
Symbolic components may also be saved in the knowledgebase within the<br>
strategy, thus increasing groupings of information in the knowledgebase that may be<br>
used for other applications.<br>
Additional aspects may be added to a specification by matching specified<br>
aspects to a library stored in a database. For example, physical characteristics of an<br>
engine may include dimensions such as, for example, fuel delivery and ignition<br>
timing characteristics and a cam profile. An engine library may include a plurality of<br>
engine definitions wherein each engine definition includes every one of the listed<br>
physical characteristics. A user may enter certain engine configuration information<br>
including, for example, engine displacement, number of cylinders, block<br>
configuration (i.e., 90°V or 60°V), or number of valves per cylinder and the engine<br>
configuration expert system will select a complete engine definition most closely<br>
matching the information input by the user from the library.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates an embodiment of a design screen 1100. The design<br>
screen 1100 includes a tree view window 1102, a flow diagram window 1104, and a<br>
diagnostics window 1106. The tree view window 1102 includes data utilized in<br>
performing an engine optimization. That data may include, for example, information<br>
that defines the engine to be optimized and information regarding how the<br><br>
optimization is to be conducted. The Tree View window 1102 displayed in Figure 8<br>
includes a test procedure in a hierarchical style and a base engine with all its<br>
components and a in a hierarchical style of Component Collections, Components<br>
and Values, wherein component collections are collections of similar components<br>
that can be displayed by selecting a plus sign next to the component collection.<br>
The diagnostic window 1106 provides information to a user regarding the<br>
status of entries in the design screen 1100. The diagnostic window may inform the<br>
user of any warnings and/or errors that may exist in the model or test procedure<br>
being defined. For example, in line one 1107 of the diagnostic window 1106, the<br>
user is informed that an engine definition must contain at least one cylinder and no<br>
cylinder has yet been defined. The user is thereby provided with relevant<br>
information regarding the design screen 1100 prior to executing the engine design<br>
program to confirm that appropriate information has been entered into the design<br>
screen 1100.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 with an embodiment of<br>
an expert engine template 1110 opened that may be completed by a user. The<br>
engine specification template 1100 may be opened by selecting "File," "New," and<br>
"Expert Template" from the main menu 1101, for example. The engine specification<br>
template 1110 provides spaces in which a user may provide basic engine<br>
information from which the engine configuration expert system may select one or<br>
more complete base engine specifications most closely matching the information<br>
entered in the template 1110. The expert engine template 1110 provides items 1114<br>
in a name column 1112 that are attributes of an engine to be optimized. As is shown<br>
in Figure 10, a user may enter characters 1116 to be placed in a values column 1118<br>
for items 1114 in the name column 1112. The characters 1116 may be numbers,<br>
letters, or entries selected from a menu such as a drop-down menu. A units column<br>
1120 provides units 1122 for characters 1116 in the values column 1118 where<br>
applicable.<br>
The expert engine template 1110 of Figure 9 is tailored to permit a power<br>
match at selected engine speeds. Other templates may be provided to assist in<br>
creating engines having other design criterion or non-engines having any desired<br><br>
design criterion. Desired engine speeds 1128 are entered in an RPM column 1130<br>
of a power entry window 1132. A desired power 1134 at each engine speed 1128 is<br>
entered in a power column 1136. A plot 1140 of desired power 1134 at the listed<br>
engine speeds 1128 is created from the entered power 1134 and engine speed 1128<br>
data.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having an engine<br>
defined therein and illustrating an automated engine design in the tree view 1102.<br>
The engine may be defined by selecting engine components from the tree view<br>
1102, placing symbols representing those components in the flow diagram 1104, and<br>
linking the components as desired. The flow diagram window 1104, thus, may<br>
include definitions of each component of the engine that may be considered in the<br>
optimization. In the example illustrated in Figure 11, the flow diagram window<br>
includes: (i) air intake pressure (INTATM) 1150, (ii) intake plenum size (INTPLN)<br>
1152, (iii) first intake pipe (INP1) 1154, (iv) throttle (THRT1) 1156, (v) second intake<br>
pipe (INP2) 1158, (vi) intake valve (INV1) 1160, (vii) cylinder (CYL1) 1162, (viii)<br>
exhaust valve (EXV1) 1164, (ix) exhaust pipe (EXP1) 1166, and (x) exhaust<br>
pressure (EXHATM) 1168 at the outlet of the exhaust pipe.<br>
Figures 12-17 illustrate objective creation. Figure 12 illustrates the design<br>
screen 1100 of Figure 8 having an embodiment of an objective specification screen<br>
1200 opened with a goals tab 1201 selected. The objective specification screen<br>
1200 may be opened by right clicking a mouse when the mouse pointer is over<br>
"Specification(l)" in the tree view 1102 and selecting "Design" from the menu<br>
produced. An available goals window 1202 provides goals that may be selected and<br>
a selected goal window 1204 includes all goals selected for the current objective<br>
specification. It should be noted that multiple specifications may be defined for an<br>
objective and multiple goals may be included in each specification.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates the design screen 1100 and objective specification<br>
screen 1200 with the goals tab 1201 selected of Figure 12 with an embodiment of a<br>
goal setting dialog box 1210 opened. The goal setting dialog box 1210 provides<br>
spaces for a user to define the goal. A goal name is specified at 1212 and matches<br>
the goal selected from the available goal window 1202. A goal type is specified at<br><br>
1214 and may be, for example, maximize the value of the goal, minimize the value of<br>
the goal, or match a goal value or set of goal values. A goal cost is specified at<br>
1216. The cost may be based on normalized values or absolute values of the goals.<br>
The goal cost is a weighting of the goal in comparison with other goals. Thus, a goal<br>
cost of 1.0 for each goal causes each goal to be equally weighted. For an<br>
application wherein fuel economy is a primary concern, for example, fuel<br>
consumption may be weighted at 2.0 and power may be weighted at 1.0. The result<br>
is that fuel consumption has twice the relative importance of power.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having the objective<br>
specification screen 1200 opened with a speedhook tab 1220 selected. The<br>
objective specification screen 1200 with a speedhook tab selected 1220 provides<br>
space in which entries related to the speeds at which simulations will be performed<br>
may be entered. A type or method of moving from simulation at one RPM to<br>
simulation at another RPM is indicated at 1222. A stepwise type is selected, which<br>
causes the optimization to step from one RPM to another after simulating a number<br>
of engine cycles. At 1230, that number of cycles to be simulated in each step may<br>
be entered. The number of cycles to be simulated in each RPM step is five in the<br>
depicted example. At 1224, a simulation starting value is entered, and at 1226, a<br>
simulation ending value is entered. The starting value in the depicted example is<br>
5000 RPM and the ending value in the depicted example is 11000 RPM. An<br>
increment of 1000 RPM has been entered at 1228. Thus, the simulation will occur at<br>
5000 RPM and in steps of 1000 RPM to 11000 RPM.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having the objective<br>
specification screen 1200 opened with a stabilization tab 1240 selected.<br>
Stabilization goes to simulating an engine, for example, through multiple rotations of<br>
the engine at a given RPM to achieve stable operation of that engine at that RPM.<br>
Stability may be measured by comparing slopes of a long line passing through the<br>
most recent simulation results to an acceptable long slope value and a short line<br>
passing through a smaller group of the most recent simulation results to an<br>
acceptable short slope value. If the slopes of those lines are acceptable, then the<br>
difference between the average value of the two lines is compared to an acceptable<br>
value for that difference. If the difference in the average value of the two lines is<br><br>
acceptable then the simulation has stabilized at that RPM. A Difference 1242 is a<br>
mathematical difference between a long line average value and a short line average<br>
value and may, for example, have a value of 0.01 and units of atmospheres. A Long<br>
Slope 1246 is a maximum acceptable value for the slope of a line passing through<br>
points specified in a Long Count 1248 and may, for example, have a value of 0.01.<br>
The Long Count 1248 is a number of most recent stabilization points used to<br>
compute the long slope and may, for example, have a value of 10 and units of cycles<br>
wherein cycles indicates a number of engine cycles to be simulated. A Short Slope<br>
1250 is the maximum acceptable value for the slope of a line passing through points<br>
specified in a Short Count 1252 and may, for example, have a value of 0.01. The<br>
Short Count 1252 is a number of most recent stabilization points used to compute<br>
the short slope, is a subset of the points in the Long Count 1248, and may, for<br>
example, have a value of 5 and units of cycles wherein cycles indicates a number of<br>
engine cycles to be simulated. Maximum Revolutions 1254 is a maximum number of<br>
engine revolutions that the simulator will run, attempting to stabilize at an RPM point<br>
to be simulated. Maximum Revolutions 1254 may, for example, have a value of 99<br>
and units of cycles wherein cycles indicates a number of engine cycles to be<br>
simulated. A Stabilization Value 1256 specifies a characteristic, the value of which is<br>
used in determining when an optimization is considered to be stabilized. The<br>
Stabilization Value 1256 may be applied to any characteristic of a base model, such<br>
as the base engine, that is to be optimized. For example, a value of BMEP may be<br>
the characteristic to which stabilization will be applied.<br>
Figure 16 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having the objective<br>
specification screen 1200 opened with a simulation tab 1260 selected. The objective<br>
specification screen 1200 with the simulation tab 1260 selected provides space in<br>
which entries related to settings used by the simulator may be entered. Multiple<br>
simulators may be available for use and so the simulation tab 1260 of the objective<br>
screen 1200 provides a space in which to select the desired simulator and define<br>
aspects of that simulator. Thus, a Simulator Name field 1272 is provided for entry or<br>
selection of the simulator to be used. For example, SIMLEV6A may be entered to<br>
select a standard engine simulator having that name. Moreover, every simulator<br>
used may be retained so that results may be recreated. In addition, other fields may<br><br>
be provided including a Fired/Motored field 1274, which is a field in which either<br>
"Fired" may be entered indicating an engine utilizes ignited fuel or "Motored" may be<br>
entered indicating an engine in which fuel is not ignited. Other fields may also be<br>
provided under the simulation tab 1240 of the objective screen 1200 as necessary or<br>
convenient to define the simulator.<br>
Figure 17 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having the objective<br>
specification screen 1200 opened with a fuel tab 1300 selected. The objective<br>
specification screen 1200 with the fuel tab 1300 selected provides space in which<br>
entries related to engine fueling may be entered. Fuel may be selected at 1302.<br>
The fuel selected may be, for example, gasoline ordiesel. Fields 1304-1310 may be<br>
automatically filled for a standard fuel such as gasoline or diesel. If a non-standard<br>
fuel is entered at 1302, however, fields 1304-1310 may be filled manually to define<br>
the fuel. The oxygen to carbon molecular ratio (O/C) of the fuel may be entered at<br>
1304. For example, ethanol (C2H50H) may have an O/C ratio of 0.5. Gasoline may<br>
have an O/C ratio of 0.0. The hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio of the fuel may be<br>
entered at 1306. For example, octane (C8H18) may have an H/C ratio of 2.25. A<br>
Calorific Fuel Value for the fuel may be entered at 1308. The calorific fuel value<br>
indicates a number of calories of heat liberated when a unit mass of fuel is burned<br>
completely in a calorimeter, wherein a calorimeter is a device that measures the<br>
quantity of heat in a substance or body. The calorific fuel value for gasoline may be<br>
43,500,000 joules per kilogram. A Heat of Vaporization may be entered at 1310.<br>
The heat of vaporization is a quantity of heat per unit mass of fuel that must be<br>
supplied to a fluid at the boiling point of the fluid to convert that fluid completely to a<br>
gas at the same temperature as the fluid. The heat of vaporization may have a value<br>
of, for example, 420,000 and units of joules per kilogram where the fuel is gasoline.<br>
Figure 18 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having an<br>
embodiment of an automated engine design strategy screen 1320 opened. The<br>
engine design strategy screen 1320 may be opened by right clicking a mouse when<br>
the mouse pointer is over "Strategy" in the tree view 1102 and selecting "Design"<br>
from the menu produced. The automated engine design strategy screen 1320<br>
includes tabs for variables 1322, constraints 1380, and the inference engine 1420.<br>
The automated engine design strategy screen 1320 includes a tree view window<br><br>
1324 and a selected variables window 1326 when the variables tab 1322 is selected.<br>
When the variable tab is selected, folders of strategy components that may be<br>
utilized in the current design are listed in the tree view 1324. The selected variables<br>
window 1326 contains a listing of variables selected from the tree view window for<br>
optimization. The tree view, in the illustrated example, includes strategy components<br>
categorized as cylinders, ends, pipes, and poppet valve systems that are related to<br>
engine components when selected. Each of those categories may be selected to<br>
display a listing of strategy components in each category.<br>
Each variable in the selected variable window 1326 of the variable tab 1322 of<br>
the automated engine design strategy screen 1320 may include a group indication<br>
1327 and a variable name 1329 in a name column 1328, a minimum value in a<br>
minimum value column 1330, a current value in a current value column 1332, a<br>
maximum value in a maximum value column 1334, a tolerance in a tolerance column<br>
1336, and units in a units column 1338. The group indication 1327 causes variables<br>
to be used in combination during the solution phase of optimization. As many<br>
variables as desired may be grouped for such combination by, for example, listing<br>
them sequentially and providing the applicable group indication 1327 next to each<br>
variable in the group. The letter "G" indicates the first variable in a group, the letter<br>
"M" indicates one or more variables in the middle of the group, and the letter "E"<br>
indicates the last variable in the group. It should be noted that multiple groups may<br>
be defined as desired. The minimum value is the minimum value for which<br>
optimization is desired for that variable. The current is the value of the variable in<br>
the base design. The maximum value is the maximum value for which optimization<br>
is desired for that variable.<br>
The variables included in the selected variable window 1326 in the depicted<br>
embodiment are exhaust pipe exit diameter (EXP1 .S[4].ExitDia) and exhaust pipe<br>
length (EXP1 .S[4].Len). The selected variable window 1326 furthermore indicates<br>
that the pipe selected will have an outlet diameter of at least 20.0 mm, a maximum<br>
diameter of 100.0 mm, and a tolerance of 5.0 mm. The selected variable window<br>
1326 also indicates that the pipe selected will have a minimum length of 75.0 mm, a<br>
maximum length of 1000.0 mm, and a tolerance of 25.0 mm. It should also be noted<br>
that the selected variable window 1328 indicates that the pipe selected has a current<br><br>
diameter of 38.0 mm and a current length of 915.0 mm. Such current values may be<br>
defined in the base engine and may be, for example, dimensions for a currently used<br>
engine or values that the user wishes to use for comparison with engine design<br>
results or as the engine design progresses. Thus, a base engine configured with<br>
current values may be considered initially by the design program and other engines<br>
falling in the range defined in the selected variables window 1326 may be compared<br>
to the current engine to determine whether an improved engine design has been<br>
created and the extent of the improvement.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having an automated<br>
engine design strategy screen 1320 opened with a variables tab 1322 selected and<br>
having an embodiment of an optimize variable settings window 1350 opened. The<br>
optimize variable settings window 1350 may be opened, for example, by selecting a<br>
variable and left clicking a mouse when the mouse pointer is over the "Edit" button<br>
on the engine design strategy screen 1320 with the variables tab 1322 selected.<br>
The optimize variable settings window 1350 provides spaces in which aspects of a<br>
variable may be defined. For example, an existing variable may be opened, one or<br>
more aspects may be modified and the modified variable may be saved. A general<br>
settings window 1352 includes fields for a variable name at 1354, a symbolic name<br>
at 1356, a tolerance at 1358, levels at 1360 and use of auto-levels at 1362 of a name<br>
column 1364. Values for the aspects included in the name column 1364 may be<br>
defined in a value column 1366 and units for the aspects included in the name<br>
column 1364 may be defined in a units column 1368. In the example illustrated in<br>
Figure 19, the settings utilized to define the variable include a variable name of<br>
EXP1.S[4].Len, a symbolic name of EXP1, a tolerance of 25.0 in units of mm, levels<br>
of 5, and no use of auto-levels.<br>
A range window 1370 in the optimize variable settings window 1350 provides<br>
fields wherein minimum, current, and maximum values for the variable may be<br>
defined. Values in the range window 1370 may be defined as absolute values,<br>
relative values, or percentage values and may be identified with appropriate units.<br>
Thus, for example, if the current value is 915.0 mm and the minimum is<br>
expressed as -50%, then the minimum value will be 50% of 915.0 mm, or 457.5 mm.<br><br>
If the current value is 915.0 mm and the maximum is defined as +50%, then the<br>
maximum value will be 150% of 915.0 mm, or 1372.5 mm. Those minimum and<br>
maximum values may then be rounded to a multiple of the tolerance added to the<br>
tolerance starting point. The tolerance is 25 mm, and the tolerance starting point is<br>
0, therefore the minimum may be rounded to 475.0 mm. The tolerance starting point<br>
may be calculated in many ways and may, for example, be the current value so that<br>
tolerance multiples are subtracted from the current value down to the minimum value<br>
and tolerance multiples are added to the current value up to the maximum value.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having an automated<br>
engine design strategy screen 1320 opened with the constraints tab 1380 selected.<br>
Equations utilized to vary attributes of the design to be simulated with other attributes<br>
or variables are listed in the constraints window 1382 of the automated engine<br>
design strategy screen 1320 when the constraints tab 1380 is selected.<br>
Figure 21 illustrates the automated engine design strategy screen 1320 with<br>
the constraints tab 1380 selected of Figure 20 having an embodiment of an edit<br>
strategy equation screen 1390 opened. The edit strategy equation screen 1390<br>
provides spaces in which aspects of a constraints equation may be displayed or<br>
modified. In the example depicted, "EXP1 .S(4)EntranceDia" is the constraint<br>
selected in the automated engine design strategy window 1380, therefore, detailed<br>
information about the selected constrain "EXP1.S(4)EntranceDia" is listed in the edit<br>
strategy equation screen 1390. The selected constraint is an entrance diameter of<br>
an exhaust pipe, and the name of that constraint (EXP1 .S(4).EntranceDia) has been<br>
entered on the left side 1392 of the edit strategy equation screen 1390. The exhaust<br>
pipe entrance diameter is equated to an exit diameter of the same exhaust pipe<br>
(EXP1.S(4).ExitDia), which has been entered on the right side 1394 of the edit<br>
strategy equation screen 1390. That equation causes the optimization to generate<br>
only engine configurations having a constant diameter exhaust pipe with equal<br>
entrance and exit diameters. Where a minimum value for the attribute being<br>
calculated by the equation is desired, such a minimum value may be entered in the<br>
minimum value dialog box 1396. Similarly, where a maximum value for the attribute<br>
being calculated by the equation is desired, such a maximum value may be entered<br>
in the maximum value dialog box 1398.<br><br>
Figure 22 illustrates an embodiment of a select variable screen 1400 that may<br>
be opened by selecting the "Edit Left Side" button on the automated engine design<br>
strategy screen 1320 with the constraints tab 1380 selected. The select variable<br>
screen 1400 provides an attribute listing 1402 selected from a tree view 1404. The<br>
attribute desired to be defined by a constraint equation may thus be selected from<br>
the attribute listing 1402. An attribute to be utilized on the left side of the edit<br>
strategy equation screen 1390 may be selected from a select variable screen similar<br>
to the select variable screen 1400 illustrated in Figure 22.<br>
Figure 23 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 having the automated<br>
engine design strategy screen 1320 opened with an inference engine tab 1420<br>
selected. Basic inference engine design strategy information is displayed in a basic<br>
inference engine design strategy window 1422. The basic inference engine design<br>
strategy window 1422 includes a listing of basic inference engine factors 1424 in a<br>
name column 1426. Each basic inference engine factor 1424 may include a value<br>
that may be entered in a value column 1428 and units that may be entered in a units<br>
column 1430. The basic inference engine factors 1424 include a binary selection as<br>
to whether exploration is desired at 1432, a maximum number of engines to be<br>
simulated during exploration at 1434, a total number of solutions desired at 1436, a<br>
maximum number of engines to be simulated in each pass at 1438, a seed for a<br>
random number generator at 1440, and a binary selection as to whether advanced<br>
options are desired at 1442.<br>
The exploration phase of optimization, in which more than one starting point<br>
may be selected as beginning points from which to search for optimal solutions, may<br>
be enabled or disabled. If exploration is not desired, a single search will take place<br>
for an optimal solution. Viewing solutions within a design space topographically,<br>
often there are multiple peaks separated by valleys. Therefore, a danger of not<br>
utilizing exploration is that the solution will approach a peak that does not include the<br>
optimal solution. By utilizing exploration and beginning the optimization process<br>
from more than one point in the design space the likelihood of finding the optimal<br>
solution is increased.<br><br>
Where exploration is used to simulate engines beginning at more than one<br>
point in the design space, a number of starting points to be selected in the design<br>
space may be entered next to the number of engines to be simulated. A total<br>
number of solutions desired may be entered next to total solutions. A number of<br>
engines to be simulated from each of those beginning points may be specified by<br>
entering that desired number of engines next to the engines in each solution pass.<br>
The number of engines to be simulated may be limited for practical purposes.<br>
Without use of a tolerance, an infinite number of engines to be simulated would exist<br>
in any design space. By utilizing tolerances, infinitely small steps in the design<br>
space are eliminated and a finite number of simulations is forced to exist in the<br>
design space. Even utilizing tolerances, however, the number of potential solutions<br>
in a design space may be great. Thus, it is desirable in certain circumstances to<br>
further reduce the number of potential solutions to be simulated. Where it is desired<br>
that only a portion of the potential solutions be simulated, potential solutions to be<br>
simulated may be chosen randomly. For example, random engines may be selected<br>
by applying a Monte Carlo selection based on a seed. Use of a seed permits<br>
repeatability from one optimization to another as is known to those skilled in the area<br>
of statistical processes.<br>
Only the values in the basic inference engine design strategy window 1422<br>
need be entered by a user. All other information necessary to define how<br>
optimization will be conducted within the design space defined under the variables<br>
tab 1322 of the automated engine design strategy screen 1320 will be inferred by the<br>
inference engine if only the basic inference engine design strategy window 1422 is<br>
completed. Alternately the advanced options window 1450 and/or the global options<br>
window 1480 may be completed where the user wants additional control over how<br>
optimization will be performed within the design space.<br>
Figure 23 also illustrates an embodiment of an advanced options window<br>
1450. Use of advanced options, which may be defined in the advanced options<br>
window 1450, may permit a type of exploration process to be utilized. Advanced<br>
inference engine information is included in a list of advanced inference engine<br>
factors 1452 included in a name column 1454. Each advanced inference engine<br><br>
factor 1452 may include a value that may be entered in a value column 1456 and<br>
units that may be entered in a units column 1458. The advanced inference engine<br>
factors 1452 include a desired exploration process at 1460. The desired exploration<br>
process may include, for example, inside matrix or full matrix, which may be selected<br>
from a drop-down box. Inside matrix indicates that points lying inside the border of<br>
the design space are to be utilized while full matrix indicates that points lying both on<br>
the border and inside the border of the design matrix are to be used in exploration.<br>
The number of total solutions at which the optimization is desired to arrive<br>
may include best design solutions and local optimum solutions. Best design<br>
solutions are the best found overall from all exploration beginning points. Local<br>
optimum solutions are solutions found from exploration beginning points other than<br>
the exploration beginning point resulting in the optimum solution. Providing solutions<br>
from different exploration beginning points (local optimums) provides comparison<br>
within the design space where multiple peaks exist in the design space when viewed<br>
topographically. As previously discussed, an example of a benefit derived from<br>
uncovering local optimums is that a less than optimal solution may be more desirable<br>
than an optimal solution where, for example, the local optimum solution approaches<br>
the optimal solution and the local optimum solution is less expensive to build<br>
because, for example, it requires fewer changes from a current design. Thus, a<br>
number of local optimum solutions desired may be entered at 1462 and a number of<br>
best designs desired may be entered at 1464.<br>
At 1466, a binary indication as to whether a second exploration is desired for<br>
each solution may be displayed. A second exploration for each solution indicates<br>
that another exploration is desired because, for example, a large number of variables<br>
are being optimized such that the number of levels for each variable has been<br>
limited, for practical purposes, to a value of two. Thus, a second exploration pass<br>
may be performed to select additional exploration points. Additional exploration<br>
passes may be performed when desired.<br>
At 1468, a binary indication as to whether dynamic combinations are desired<br>
may be displayed. At 1470, a binary indication as to whether exploration results<br>
should be saved may be displayed. Exploration results are the results of design<br><br>
configurations simulated during exploration. At 1472, a binary indication as to<br>
whether solution results are to be saved may be displayed. Solution results are the<br>
results of simulation of the best designs and the local optimums. At 1474, a binary<br>
indication as to whether to generate a calibration table may be made. A calibration<br>
table is a table of optimum values associated with specified RPMs. For example,<br>
optimization for an engine may be specified to occur at regular RPM steps<br>
throughout an RPM range and the optimum value associated with each specified<br>
RPM may be desired. The calibration table may provide that information.<br>
At 1476, a starting percentage for purpose of the portion of a step to be<br>
simulated on one or more initial passes is entered and at 1478, an ending<br>
percentage for purpose of the portion of a step to be simulated on one or more last<br>
passes is entered.<br>
Figure 23 also includes a global options window 1480. The global options<br>
window 1480 includes a name column 1482 containing a listing of global factors<br>
1484, a value column 1486 containing characters related to the global factors 1484<br>
and a units column 1488 containing units related to the global factors where<br>
appropriate.<br>
At 1490, a default min/max delta value is entered, and at 1492, a default<br>
min/max delta description is entered. The default min/max delta value may include a<br>
multiplier that is multiplied by the current value and subtracted from the current value<br>
to arrive at a minimum value and added to the current value to arrive at a maximum<br>
value when the default min/max delta description is "times current variable value."<br>
Other default min/max options may include "times current variable tolerance."<br>
At 1494, a default tolerance value is entered, and at 1496, a default tolerance<br>
description is entered. The default tolerance value may include a multiplier that is<br>
multiplied by the default internal tolerance to arrive at a default tolerance when the<br>
default tolerance description is "times current variable tolerance." Other default<br>
tolerance options may include "times current variable value."<br>
It should be noted that design strategy information may be defined and reused<br>
without the necessity of reconsidering and reassigning that information. For<br><br>
example, once it has been determined, possibly through experimentation or<br>
experience in using the system, that a strategy is appropriate for use in certain<br>
situations, that strategy may be approved for use in those situations. Thus,<br>
experience may be retained in the system and lower level designers that may not<br>
have the experience to set-up the strategy, may nonetheless participate in design by<br>
capitalizing on the experience of others.<br>
Figure 24 illustrates the design screen 1100 of Figure 8 with an embodiment<br>
of a symbolic component resolution screen 1500 opened. The symbolic component<br>
resolution screen 1500 may be opened from the design screen 1100 by selecting<br>
"Symbolic Components" in the tree view 1102 and selecting "Design" from the menu<br>
produced. The symbolic component resolution screen 1500 provides an area from<br>
which one or more strategy attributes may be related to one or more base design<br>
attributes. The symbolic variable depicted in Figure 24 is a component definition<br>
and, in particular, defines an exhaust pipe. As may be seen in symbolic component<br>
resolution screen 1500, the symbolic variable component 1502 is a pipe, the<br>
symbolic name 1504 is "EXHAUST RUNNER" and the actual name 1506 of the<br>
engine variable is EXP1. That causes strategy attributes associated with the<br>
symbolic name "EXHAUST RUNNER" to be applied to the engine component<br>
"EXP1" under the component "Pipe."<br>
An expert system may include many component parts that may vary<br>
depending on the function to be performed by the expert system. At its most basic, a<br>
typical expert system may include a knowledgebase, an inference engine, and a<br>
user interface. The knowledgebase may contain information that is the accumulation<br>
of the training provided to the expert system. The inference engine may include a<br>
set of instructions or rules that acts upon information typically contained within the<br>
knowledgebase to, for example, create an optimized design. The user interface<br>
typically permits a user to input information and instructions into the expert system<br>
(i.e., train the system) and provides results of operation of the expert system to the<br>
user. An expert system that is intended to create designs for mechanical or other<br>
devices would also typically include a simulator that permits a computer to simulate<br>
the operation of the device.<br><br>
The present expert system may include a repository of information or<br>
knowledge and can also perform operations on that knowledge. The expert system<br>
is typically a computer based system having a processor for performing<br>
computations and a database structure whereby information comprising the<br>
knowledgebase is stored in a storage device. The expert system may be analogized<br>
with a human expert as it requires training, stores information it learns in memory or<br>
a storage device, and combines that learned information with computer processor<br>
intelligence to provide desired results. The expert system, however, provides the<br>
additional advantage of providing a way to leverage the abilities of one or more<br>
human experts.<br>
The expert system may be trained by providing its knowledgebase with<br>
information related to one or more processes, devices, or systems on which the<br>
expert system is to operate. In the example wherein engines are to be designed by<br>
the expert system, that information may relate to one or more engines and related<br>
components.<br>
The expert system may also be trained by providing its knowledgebase with<br>
information related to the operation and interaction of those processes, devices, or<br>
systems. In the example wherein engines are to be designed by the expert system,<br>
that operational and interactive information may take the form of one or more<br>
simulators that contain instructions that relay to the expert system how an engine<br>
having various components would perform when those components are combined at<br>
various levels of engine operation.<br>
The expert system may also be trained by providing its knowledgebase with<br>
information related to objectives that are desired to be accomplished by the expert<br>
system and rules for evaluating each design. That objective information would<br>
typically be related to variations in the processes, devices, or systems that may be<br>
implemented in a search for a process, device, or system that provides a desired<br>
result or performance. In the example wherein engines are to be designed, that<br>
objective information may take the form of one or more test procedures and one or<br>
more specifications that define one or more goals. Desired variation of one or more<br>
variable components within desired ranges at desired tolerance steps to identify<br><br>
components that will in combination, most closely achieve the desired operation may<br>
be defined in a strategy. The objective may also include a method by which results<br>
are quantified to be compared to the goals.<br>
The process, device, or system information, the operation and interaction<br>
information, the objective information and any other information stored in the expert<br>
system may be referred to in combination as a knowledgebase.<br>
The expert system as it exists prior to having its knowledgebase populated<br>
with information may be referred to as a "framework." That framework may include<br>
one or more inference engines that include instructions regarding how rules are to be<br>
applied to information to be provided from the knowledgebase and one or more<br>
simulators, along with hardware such as processors, memory, data storage facilities,<br>
and user interface hardware. The knowledgebase is then the accumulated<br>
information on which the framework may operate. The information that comprises<br>
the knowledgebase may be input by a human that we will refer to as a knowledge<br>
engineer and may also be created and accumulated by operation of the expert<br>
system. Because the expert system operates utilizing its knowledgebase, where<br>
some or all of that knowledgebase has been input by a knowledge engineer the<br>
results achieved by the expert system will tend to vary depending on the information<br>
placed in the knowledgebase by the knowledge engineer. Thus, when a common<br>
expert system framework is implemented by different knowledge engineers, different<br>
information may be placed in the knowledgebases and varying results may be<br>
achieved by those implementations of the expert system.<br>
It should furthermore be recognized that an expert system that has<br>
accumulated expert knowledge may be operated by a person who is less than expert<br>
and still provide the same expert results that would be achieved if an expert such as<br>
a knowledge engineer operated the expert system. For example, a knowledge<br>
engineer may operate the expert system utilizing the information that he input into<br>
the knowledgebase to assure that information provides the desired results. Where<br>
appropriate the information may further be grouped by the knowledge engineer such<br>
that information related to a particular device, procedure, or system is grouped in an<br>
application specific project. Non-experts, such as application engineers may then<br><br>
utilize the information in a project to create one or more designs that are the same as<br>
designs that would be created by the knowledge engineer. Thus, the knowledge of<br>
the knowledge engineer may be leveraged by deploying that knowledge throughout<br>
an organization for use by experts and non-experts alike through use of the expert<br>
, system.<br>
Moreover, a person who is knowledgeable about, for example, market<br>
demands to a greater extent than a knowledge engineer, may utilize the knowledge<br>
of the knowledge engineer that is included in the expert system to create optimum<br>
solutions that meet market demands. Thus, the expert system may solve problems<br>
or create designs that would otherwise require time consuming cross-training<br>
between multiple humans.<br>
Utilizing an expert system that optimizes an engine and related components<br>
for use in a motor vehicle as an example, engine system components that are not to<br>
be changed, because for example the cost of altering those components is too great,<br>
may be defined in an engine definition. Components of the engine system that may<br>
be varied may be referred to as variables and may be defined in the expert system.<br>
Limitations on the magnitude of the variation of those variables may also be provided<br>
in the expert system. Test procedures may be defined in the objective portion of the<br>
expert system to describe in computer simulation terms the manner in which the<br>
engine and components are to be tested or simulated.<br>
The engine design expert system may be arranged to facilitate non-design<br>
expert use of the system. For example, the engine design expert system may be<br>
arranged in projects with each project corresponding to a base type of engine. A<br>
project may then include various definitions of components having fixed or variable<br>
values, also called "engine definitions," test procedures, and sub-knowledgebases,<br>
which are discussed further in connection with Figure 25. A knowledge engineer<br>
may create projects such that they include only definitions that are known to create<br>
desirable designs of that engine. An application engineer may then utilize the<br>
definitions included within the project to create new designs of that engine utilizing<br>
the expert system that are the same designs the knowledge engineer would create<br>
utilizing the expert system because those designs use the same information that<br><br>
would be used by the knowledge engineer. Those new designs may be varied and<br>
may optimize, for example, fuel efficiency, power, or emissions of the engine or<br>
match particularly desired engine function characteristics. The application engineer<br>
may also simulate already designed engine systems to, for example, verify operation<br>
at various engine speeds and thereby confirm that those designs are appropriate at<br>
all engine speeds.<br>
The expert system also provides quality assurance of designs because<br>
control is placed on the parameters within which an application engineer can make<br>
modifications.<br>
An application specific interface may be provided as a portion of the expert<br>
system that may be utilized by application engineers or other users. The application<br>
specific interface may permit those application engineers to access projects that<br>
have system definitions created and approved by experts and utilize those definitions<br>
to create optimum designs.<br>
Thus, the application specific interface provides a facility that is easy to use<br>
and delivers a result that is equivalent to a result that the knowledge engineer would<br>
provide. That, in return, frees the knowledge engineers to focus on other designs<br>
while application engineers, marketing personnel, or others, create designs without<br>
necessitating involvement by the knowledge engineer.<br>
Figure 25 illustrates a user tree view 1602 of an embodiment of automated<br>
engine design expert system screen 1600. The user tree view 1602 permits access<br>
to the entire expert system so that the expert system may be modified by the<br>
knowledge engineer. As may be seen at 1604, one or more projects may be created<br>
within the expert system. A project entitled "Initial Testing" 1606 is included as an<br>
application specific interface project. Within that application specific interface project<br>
1606 there are one or more engine definitions in an engine file 1608, one or more<br>
test procedures in a test procedure file 1610, and one or more sub-knowledgebases<br>
1612. Each sub-knowledgebase 1612 may contain an objectives folder 1614 with<br>
one or more objectives, a strategies folder 1616 with one or more strategies, and<br>
one or more automated engine designs 1618. The automated engine designs 1618<br>
may include a particular engine, a particular test procedure, a particular objective,<br><br>
and one or more strategies, all of which may have been selected from the project by<br>
an application engineer to be utilized in, for example, an optimization.<br>
Figure 26 illustrates the selection of an automated engine design from the<br>
engine design expert system screen 1600 to produce a drop down menu 1650 that<br>
may be utilized to access an application specific interface by selecting the<br>
application specific interface item 1652 from the drop down menu 1650.<br>
In addition, a management interface (not illustrated) may be accessed by<br>
selecting the AutomatedEngineDesign Status item 1656 from the menu 1650.<br>
Also, a knowledge engineering interface (not illustrated) may be accessed by<br>
selecting the Knowledge Engineering Interface item 1658 from the menu 1650.<br>
Figure 27 illustrates an embodiment of an application specific interface screen<br>
1700 for a particular project. The application specific interface screen 1700 includes<br>
an application specific interface tree view 1702. While the information required to<br>
define and optimize the engine to be designed in that view 1702 may be extensive,<br>
possibly including thousands of engine characteristics and rules for simulation and<br>
optimization, the tree view 1702 permits modification of only a limited number of<br>
those characteristics and rules. The limitation of the items available in the<br>
application specific interface screen 1700 may have been determined by a<br>
knowledge engineer to limit the ability of an application engineer using the screen to<br>
make modifications to the characteristics and rules, as the application engineer or<br>
other user of the application specific interface screen 1700 would be unable to<br>
modify any information that is not accessible.<br>
As may be typical, the application specific interface screen 1700 displays<br>
extensive objective information so that the application engineer using that screen<br>
can extensively modify objectives 1704 of the design. The application specific<br>
interface screen 1700, however, simply lists the strategy 1706 that will be used<br>
during a simulation and the engine definition 1708 that will be used during a<br>
simulation without permitting the application engineer to make any modifications to<br>
those aspects of the design. By permitting the application engineer to extensively<br>
access and modify the objective 1704, the knowledge engineer that created this<br><br>
application specific interface screen 1700 has permitted the application engineer to<br>
formulate goals 1709, such as matching power to a desired power curve at 1710,<br>
placing a high limit on hydrocarbon output at 1712, and minimizing fuel consumption<br>
at 1714. The creating knowledge engineer has also permitted the application<br>
engineer to formulate certain aspects of the test procedure 1716 to be used so that<br>
the application engineer can specify such things as the fuel to be utilized in the<br>
simulation at 1718, the engine speeds at which to perform the simulation at 1720,<br>
and the ratio of the throttle area that is open at 1722. By preventing the application<br>
engineer from altering the strategy 1706 and engine 1708, the knowledge engineer,<br>
however, prevents the application engineer from tampering with aspects of engine<br>
design that might be better dealt with by a more knowledgeable knowledge engineer.<br>
It should be noted that the application engineer may and probably should<br>
change the description associated with the objective 1724 and the description<br>
associated with the automated engine design 1726 if any changes are made to the<br>
objective parameters so that each design variation is uniquely identified.<br>
The expert system may also include management interface functions that<br>
permit management to view the status of operations occurring in the expert system<br>
and permit management to control the priority of the execution of those operations.<br>
Like human resources, computer systems are typically a finite resource so<br>
that a limited number of operations can be performed by the computer system at a<br>
given time. More so than humans, however, computer system resources can be<br>
redirected from one or more activities to one or more other activities quickly with little<br>
or no loss of efficiency. That is one way the expert system provides greater flexibility<br>
to management than a group of human experts might.<br>
A status monitor (not shown) may be provided to management personnel and<br>
others that displays the status of one or more operations that the expert system is<br>
currently processing. The status monitor may indicate, for example, the goal, the<br>
progress of the expert system in reaching the goal, and the amount of processing<br>
that is required to complete the processing of each operation being performed.<br>
Review of the status of an optimization may be viewed by simply selecting an<br>
optimization to view and refreshing the status of that optimization, for example.<br><br>
The goal of a particular operation may, for example, be to optimize an engine<br>
design to match a desired power curve over a range of engine speeds by modifying<br>
engine and related component characteristics. For such an operation, the status<br>
monitor may display graphically the desired power curve and plot on the same graph<br>
a power curve for the engine design used as a starting point and the best engine<br>
design created thus far. The status monitor may furthermore include an estimate of<br>
the number of engines simulated and the number of engines yet to be simulated in<br>
that optimization. The status monitor may also display the desired completion time<br>
for each optimization or a priority hierarchy for each optimization being performed.<br>
The information displayed may be used by a manager or other to make<br>
decisions regarding how system operation should take place going forward in time.<br>
For example, the manager may place one optimization on hold to allow another<br>
optimization to be completed more quickly. The manager or other user may also<br>
terminate an optimization if, for example, the goal has been approximated to an<br>
acceptable level and no further optimization is desired, or if an optimization is<br>
performing so poorly that it should be revised and then re-executed. The manager<br>
or other user may also modify the priorities of optimization runs to meet desired<br>
schedules.<br>
The expert system may modify optimization priorities dynamically to meet<br>
desired completion times for each optimization running. The expert system may also<br>
perform other automatic functions. For example, when many characteristics are<br>
selected to be varied during an optimization run, an optimization system may not<br>
perform efficiently because the compounded number of variations may overwhelm<br>
the optimization hardware available to perform the operation or the time to perform<br>
the optimization may be onerously long. The expert system may, therefore, optimize<br>
those characteristics in subsets or groups of characteristics with one or more best<br>
solutions feeding into a second or greater round of optimization. That process may<br>
also be cyclical with results from later rounds of optimization being utilized as starting<br>
designs for earlier performed groups of characteristics.<br>
Another example of an automatic function that the expert system may perform<br>
to improve resulting designs is to check the sensitivity of each variable varying in the<br><br>
optimization and reevaluate variables exhibiting a high degree of sensitivity.<br>
Sensitivity is related to the degree to which a design changes when a small variation<br>
of a variable, such as one tolerance value, is implemented. A large change in the<br>
result from a small change in the value of the variable indicates a high sensitivity and<br>
may indicate that the optimum result could be improved upon. Thus, the expert<br>
system may set a reduced tolerance for the variable or variables showing a high<br>
sensitivity and rerun the optimization for those variables utilizing the resulting design<br>
as a base design.<br>
Yet another function that may be utilized when optimizations are being<br>
performed on multiple machines is a selection function whereby machines having<br>
greater capacities and/or lesser loads may be automatically selected to provide the<br>
most efficient utilization for high priority runs or for meeting a deadline.<br>
In addition, the expert system may be operated numerous times sequentially<br>
or simultaneously to reach a desired result. For example, multiple optimizations may<br>
be run using different strategies to find a best solution. In another example, many<br>
variables may be desired and multiple operations of the expert system may be run<br>
sequentially for groups of those variables with each sequential run suing one or more<br>
best solutions from the previous run.<br>
It should be noted that terms including knowledge engineer, application<br>
engineer and manager are intended to apply to functions performed by humans and<br>
the expert system is described in functional sections corresponding to those human<br>
functions. It is acknowledged, however, that any one person may perform more than<br>
one of those functions and so have access to multiple functional aspects of the<br>
expert system.<br>
In an embodiment of the expert system, a structure is contemplated that<br>
organizes the workings of the expert system for utilization users of various levels and<br>
for management oversight of the operation of the expert system. That structure is<br>
underpinned by organizing information in a knowledgebase.<br>
A variety of project subknowledgebases are included in the knowledgebase.<br>
Each project may be structured to include all knowledge needed or thought to be<br><br>
needed to create a desired design or process. Projects may be further subdivided<br>
into subprojects also containing knowledge thought to be needed to create a desired<br>
design or process. Access to those projects and subprojects may then be limited to<br>
limit the knowledge to which a user, such as a novice user, has access. Thus, in the<br>
example of an expert system that is to design engines, each project and subproject<br>
may contain at least one base engine definition, at least one test procedure, at least<br>
one objective, and at least one strategy. During simulation or after designs are<br>
simulated, for example to optimize a base engine to meet desired objectives,<br>
resulting engine definitions, which are referred to as automated engine designs<br>
herein, are created and are also stored in the knowledgebase for the applicable<br>
project. In a typical application, a knowledge engineer may place the appropriate<br>
information (i.e., base engine definitions, test procedures, objectives, and strategies)<br>
in the project and an application engineer may utilize that information in various<br>
combinations to achieve the desired objectives. Other variations are also<br>
contemplated wherein, for example, no objectives are provided by the knowledge<br>
engineer and the application engineer is permitted to create objectives based, for<br>
example, on marketing needs without input from the knowledge engineer. In that<br>
way, the best design information is made available by the knowledge engineer and<br>
that information may be combined with marketing needs by an application engineer<br>
to create one or more optimized designs or processes.<br>
Subprojects may also be beneficial where subdivision of information within a<br>
project is desired, for example, to structure the knowlegebase that is contained<br>
within the project or to further control access to the knowledgebase contained within<br>
the project. Subprojects may be viewed as nested projects.<br>
Information that is created to be included in projects may also be organized in<br>
non-project subknowledgebases. For example, in an embodiment, a strategy<br>
subknowledgebase is contained within the knowledgebase. That strategy<br>
subknowledgebase contains a variety of subdirectories to organize strategies.<br>
Strategy subdirectories might include a provider subdirectory for strategies<br>
developed by the expert system provider, an unassigned subdirectory for strategies<br>
provided by other sources outside the user organization, separate subdirectories for<br>
each knowledge engineer in the organization, an approved subdirectory and a<br><br>
trashbin subdirectory. When a knowledge engineer determines that a strategy that<br>
he created and stored in his subdirectory is not useful, that knowledge engineer may<br>
move that strategy to the trashbin. A manager may then review the strategies in the<br>
trashbin and delete those strategies that the manager determines are not to be used<br>
again. The manager may also move or copy strategies from any subdirectory that<br>
have been proven to be beneficial to the approved subdirectory. That organization<br>
of strategies creates a framework that provides a manager with the ability to<br>
supervise development of the strategies portion of the knowledgebase.<br>
Organization of information outside of the projects is beneficial when, for<br>
example, that information may be applied to multiple projects. Certain information<br>
may not be applicable to multiple projects and so may be maintained only in the<br>
applicable project, while other information, like certain strategies, may be applicable<br>
to multiple projects. Information that may be applicable to multiple projects may be<br>
organized outside of the projects subdirectories in, for example, a strategies<br>
subknowledgebase for strategies with potential for more than one use. Strategies<br>
and other information organized outside of the projects may then be copied into all<br>
appropriate project files or otherwise related to the appropriate projects.<br>
Organization of various forms of information outside the projects, other than<br>
strategies for example, may also be implemented.<br>
In an embodiment wherein engines are being designed by the expert system,<br>
a structure called an automated engine design ("AED") may be implemented. Each<br>
AED contains a subset of information from the knowledgebase that may be referred<br>
to as a subknowledgebase. That information may be used to perform optimizations<br>
or sets of simulations intended to find an optimum engine design. One or more<br>
users may place certain information in an AED including one or more base design<br>
definitions, one or more objectives that define what is to be optimized, and one or<br>
more strategies that define how the optimization is to be performed. Those base<br>
engine definitions, objectives, and strategies may be stored in files entitled<br>
"Engines," "Objectives," and "Strategies" respectively, that are associated with that<br>
AED in this embodiment. When an AED is created, those "Engines," "Objectives,"<br>
and "Strategies" files may be empty. Appropriate information may then be added to<br>
those files by appropriate people. For example, base engines definitions on which<br><br>
optimizations are to be run may be added by a knowledge engineer, proven<br>
strategies for various optimizations having to do with that type of engine may be<br>
added by a knowledge engineer, and objectives may be added by an application<br>
engineer. Alternately, pointers to those base engine definitions, objectives, and<br>
strategies may be created in the AED where those base engine definitions,<br>
objectives, and strategies are stored elsewhere in the knowledgebase.<br>
Once appropriate information has been added to the AED, the application<br>
engineer may select an appropriate base engine definition, select one or more<br>
desired objectives, and select one or more strategies that are appropriate for making<br>
modifications to the base engine definition to create an engine that optimizes those<br>
objectives. The selected information may then be optimized by creating and<br>
simulating a plurality of engine designs from the selected base engine definitions,<br>
objectives and strategies.<br>
During a simulation, resulting engine designs are generally created and the<br>
best resulting engine designs are saved. After an optimization has been performed,<br>
the base engine design, objectives and strategies that were utilized in that<br>
simulation, along with the saved resulting designs may be saved in a subdirectory<br>
within the AED. In that way, managers and engineers have a history that tells them<br>
how a resulting engine design was created. That information may then be utilized for<br>
many purposes including deciding which strategies provide the best results and<br>
should be moved into the "Approved" directory.<br>
While the present invention has been disclosed with reference to certain<br>
embodiments, numerous modifications, alterations, and changes to the described<br>
embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention,<br>
as defined in the appended claims. Accordingly, it is intended that the present<br>
invention not be limited to the described embodiments, but that it have the full scope<br>
