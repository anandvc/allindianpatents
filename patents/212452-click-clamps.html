The present invention relates to click clamps for fixing rods in almirahs or in doors/ windows/ pelmets for hanging clothes or curtains<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
For years, clamps are being used for placing curtain rods . The conventional curtain clamps consists of a hollow cylinder with internal screw threads on one end, a base plate with a hole at each end and a hollow cylinder with external threads riveted to the base plate. These three elements make one module and two of such modules are required for fixing one curtain rod. These modules are fixed to the surface by screws or nails.<br>
The drawbacks of the existing clamps are that nails or screws are required to fix these clamps, which spoils the surface. Also, fixing of the clamps is a time consuming process. This entire operation is not only messy but in totality is expensive.<br>
The existing clamp is moreover a permanent fixture and changing their position is virtually not possible. Even if removed or its position is changed, it leaves a dent and scar on the surface.<br>
The entire process of having a curtain clamp is not cost effective as it may also require the services of a carpenter. These clamps have a limited life, as they tend to rust with time.<br><br>
dver the period of years, curtain channels are being used as a substitute for curtain rods. They have been an improvement over the existing curtain clamps and rods. More recently, Venetian blinds are also being used in place of curtains.<br>
One of the disadvantages of curtain channels is that they require lubrication time and again for the smooth movement of the curtain clips. Also, very often the curtain clips break due to the weight of the curtain. Reinstating more or extra curtain clips require the entire channel to be removed or unscrewed. Furthermore, these channels are relatively expensive and again require the services of a carpenter for installation.<br>
The object of the present invention is to eliminate all the aforesaid drawbacks of the conventional clamps and make them user friendly. The click clamps according to the present invention is easy to install and its flexibility of fixation makes it versatile for use.<br>
Another object of the invention is to have the option of changing the location of the clamps without having any unpleasant dents on the surfaces fixed.<br>
Yet still another object of the present invention is that the clamps need not be nailed or screwed onto the surface used for installation.<br>
Furthermore, the click clamps according to the present invention can be easily installed by any person and hence does not require the services of a carpenter.<br><br>
Unlike a three element module, the click clamps according to the present invention comes in a single unit. It is economical than the cheapest of the clamps available in the market.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a click clamp for fixing rods in almirahs Or in<br>
doors/ windows/ pelmets for hanging clothes or curtains comprising:<br>
a base frame means,<br>
one end of said frame is provided with a spring steel flap bent at an acute angle between 20-30° at a lower end and the upper end of said flap is tapered to slip fit the rod and the other end of said frame is provided with a stopper means to stop the rod from overshooting the clamp.<br>
The said base frame means is a metallic plate.<br>
The said metallic plate means has side extensions perpendicular to said base frame means.<br>
The said side extensions have one hole /slot at its upper end to provide for a stopper means to prevent said    rod from overshooting.<br>
The back side of the base frame means has an adhesive layer or foam/rubber to provide friction to said clamp.<br><br>
The said spring steel flap is fixed to said base frame by riveting, welding or by a nut bolt arrangement.<br>
The thickness of the said steel strip is 0.75 to l.25mm to provide flexibility to the fastening means.<br>
The stopper means is in the form of a nut and bolt provided in the holes of the said extension of the base frame or a metal strip provided in the slot.<br>
The present invention also provides a click clamp system for fixing rods in almirahs or in doors/ windows/ pelmets for hanging clothes or curtains comprising at least two click clamps as claimed in the preceding claims for providing a rod, which is pushed between two click clamps and is rigidly held.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 - illustrates the click clamp according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is the base frame used in the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 is the steel flap according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 is the stopper arrangement<br>
Figures 5 to 8 define the various steps of installing a click clamp.<br><br>
The click clamp according to figure 1 consists of a base frame (1), one end of which is housed a spring steel flap (2) which is be fastened, riveted, welded or fixed at one end (A) of the base frame.<br>
The base frame (1) to which the steel flap (2) is fastened can be of any shape and is therefore not limited to the shape illustrated by the figure. The base frame (1) is made up of mild steel, plastic or other metals. The base frame has side extensions (Figure 2a), which are perpendicular to the base frame for holding the stopper arrangement and reinforcing the base frame.<br>
The spring steel flap of figure 2 is a metal strip which is bent at an angle of 20 °-30 º at a point nearer to its lower end (Fig 3a) at point B. The upper end of the steel flap is tapered and given an appropriate shape so that it slips into the curtain rod when the rod is pushed upward in the clamp.<br>
The steel spring strips have a thickness of about 0.7 to 1.25 mm. The stopper means (Si or S2) is provided at the top end of the base frame to avoid the curtain rod (R) from overshooting while fixing/ erecting the rod which can be in the form of nut bolt arrangement (fig 4a) or a strip arrangement (Fig 4b)<br>
The installation of the click clamps is a simple operation (figures 5 to 8), the steps are to clean the surface to which the click clamps is to be fixed and place the clamps (Figure 5). A rod (R) of about 10 to 15 mm shorter than the distance between the two surfaces is taken. One end of the rod is slipped onto the spring steel flap (2) of one of the clamps (figure 6). The other end of rod is then slipped onto said steel flap (2) of the other clamp and pushed up until<br><br>
t fits with a click sound (figure 7). To take out the curtain rod, the stopper means (Si or S2) (Fig 4a, 4b) of one of the arrangement is removed and the rod is pushed upwards till it comes out (Figure 8).<br>
Scope and applications of the click clamps<br>
1.	Suspending rods between two rigid surfaces.<br>
2.	Utility  to  display  article/  goods/products  in  a show  room/  shop/ commercial complex.<br>
3.	Excellent contraption for displaying products.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
