				<td>Specification<br>
The invention relates to a coupling device of an actuating member of a switching means in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
A coupling device of this type is provided, for instance, on the actuating member of a single-pole automatic cut-out, residual current operated device or a protective motor switch. Frequently switching means such as accessories switches, remote releases or auxiliary switches are mounted on or stacked to such switches. For a synchronous actuation of the switches the actuating members of switches stacked in such manner can be connected with the aid of a coupling element.<br>
It is known from prior art to design such a coupling element as a circular axis movable through through holes of actuating<br>
members of adjacent, switches  An auxiliary switch, for instance, can be mounted on an LS switch, said circular axis :.&gt;':.i:\-: ;.iu •.'•:,••..; "..:',.; 01:^:1 t."ic enough ho.l ;.•:.. ui Hue act. u ; i. iiuj iueiiibtj r. i-. of both switches. As the circular axis is inserted inside the through holes of the actuating members, the circular axis cannot be used for mounting further additional means on the already attached auxiliary switch.<br>
It is furthermore known from prior art to integrally form a projection serving as coupling element on the actuating member of an auxiliary switch. When the auxiliary switch is mounted, for instance, on an LS switch, this projection can be embedded in a suitable recess in the actuating member of the LS switch, whereby the two switches are coupled to each other. Due to their design, such actuating members of auxiliary switches provided with a projection can only be mounted either on the<br>
left or on the right side of the actuating member of an LS switch, however.<br>
Hence the object underlying the invention is to provide a coupling device of an actuating member of a switch by which an easy and quick coupling of actuating members of further switching means is possible on both sides of the actuating member. Moreover the coupling device is to permit a stacking of a plurality of switching means.<br>
The above-mentioned object is achieved by the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1. Preferred embodiments are described in the subclaims.<br>
The invention is hereinafter described in more detail by way of embodiments with reference to the drawings, in which<br>

Fig. 1 shows a schematic side view of a single-pole switch 1. The switch 1 comprises a toggle 10 usually made of synthetic resin, e.g. a thermoplast. This toggle is supported in the switch 1 and is movable about a swiveling axis into an on-position and an off-position. The toggle 10 includes an actuating member 20 attached to the toggle 10 via a plug-in connection 2 indicated in Fig. 2a. Moreover in the actuating member 20 a through hole 33 extending in parallel to the swiveling axis 11 is formed.<br>
Opposite to the toggle 10 the switch 1 shown in Fig. 1 includes a mounting portion 12 by means of which the switch 1 can be attached to a holding rail not shown.<br>

member 20. For forming the coupling device a coupling element 40 described further below is inserted in the through hole 33 of the actuating member.<br>
The through hole 33 of such an actuating member 20 has a rectangular shape with inner walls 21 to 24 - as illustrated in Fig. 4 -. Moreover the through hole 33 is generally divided into an inserting portion 36 and a clamping portion 37, as shown in Fig. 3a.<br>
With the aid of the inserting portion 36 the insertion of the coupling element 40 into the through hole 33 starting out from an inserting end 34 on the left in Fig. 3a is facilitated. To this end, the distance of the upper and lower inner walls 21<br>
and 22 toward the inserting end 34 is enlarged in the inserting portion 36.<br>
The clamping portion 37 securing the coupling element 40 against falling out of the through hole is adjacent to the inserting portion 36. An outlet end 35 of the through hole 33 on the right according to Fig. 3a is assigned to the clamping portion 37.<br>
In the clamping portion 37 a catching nose 26 is provided at the upper inner wall 21 of the through hole 33 according to Fig. 3a, which catching nose serves for the locking with the coupling element 40 described further below. A shoulder 27 which is offset with respect to the outlet end 35 in the interior of the through hole 33 and is formed at the lower inner wall 22 of the through hole 33. The shoulder 27 has a periphery 28 and a bearing surface 29. The periphery 28 faces the inserting end 34 of the through hole 33.<br>
The coupling element 40 is represented in detail in Fig. 3b.<br>
3b. The base portion 51 is connected to a front end section 47 on the right in Fig. 3b and a rear end section 50 provided on the left. Projections 41, 42 and set-offs  43, 44 are provided both on the front end section 47 and on the rear end section 50.<br>
To put it more exactly, the projection 41 disposed at the rear end section 50 and the projection 42 disposed at the front end section 47 point into opposite directions along an axis of symmetry X of the base portion 51. Moreover the projections 41 and 42 - in a direction normal to the axis of symmetry X - are arranged to be offset with respect to each other. I.e. that the projection 41 provided at the rear end section 50 is opposite to the set-off 44 provided at the front end section 47. Correspondingly, the set-off 43 provided at the rear end<br>
section 50 is opposite to the projection 42 provided at the front end section 47.<br>
According to Fig. 3b, a graduation 45 arranged at the lower longitudinal side 49 of the coupling element 40 follows to the set-off 44 of the  front end section 47. Opposite to the graduation 45 on the upper longitudinal side 48 there are provided two recesses 46a, 46b spaced apart from each other in the direction of the axis of symmetry X.<br>
The insertion of the coupling element 40 into the through hole 33 of the actuating member 20 is illustrated in the space diagram of Fig. 4. Accordingly, at first the front end section 47 of the coupling element 40 is inserted in the direction of arrow A through the inlet end 34 into the inserting portion 36 of the through hole 33. The front end section 47 of the coupling element 40 can move freely through the inserting portion 36 of the through hole 33, until the front end section 47 abuts against the catching nose 26 or the shoulder 27 of the clamping portion 37.<br>

resistance held oy the catching nose 26 and penetrates the clamping portion 37, the shearing force exerted on the rear end section 50 of the coupling element has to be considerably increased. With a sufficient shearing force, then the front end section 47 of the coupling element 40 can penetrate the clamping portion 37 and can be brought into the first assembly position shown in Fig. 2a.<br>
In this first assembly position the projection 41 of the coupling element 40 is embedded in the through hole 33 such that it is in alignment with the inlet end 34 of the through hole 33. Furthermore the set-off 43 of the coupling element forms a recess 25 together with the inner walls 21, 23 and 24 of the through hole 33. In contrast to the embedded projection<br>
41, the opposite projection 42 protrudes from the outlet end 35 of the through hole 33.<br>
To determine the first assembly position shown in Fig. 2a the catching nose 26 provided in the through hole 33 is locked in one 46a of the recesses 46a, 46b. In addition, in the first assembly position - as illustrated in Fig. 2a - the graduation 45 of the coupling element 40 may be in contact with the periphery 28 of the shoulder 27.<br>
Starting out from the first assembly position according to Fig. 2a, the coupling element 40 is movable to a second assembly position. To this effect, merely a pressing force has to be exerted on the projection 42 of the coupling element 40 opposite to the inserting direction pointing in the direction of arrow A. Thereby first the locking between the catching nose 26 and the recess 46a can be released, whereupon the coupling element 40 can be displaced until the catching nose 26 locks in the further recess 46b. By this locking the second assembly position - corresponding to the first assembly position - is<br>
corresponds to the distance of the recesses 46a, 46b.<br>
In the second mounting position the projection 42 of the coupling element 40 is - as aforementioned - embedded in the through hole 33 in such a manner that it is in alignment with the outlet end 35 of the through hole 33. Furthermore the set-off 44 of the coupling, element forms a recess together with the inner walls 22, 23 and 24 of the through hole. On the other hand, the projection 41 protrudes from the inlet end 34 of the through hole 33.<br>
As can moreover be taken from Fig. 2a, the graduation 45 is adapted to the contour of the shoulder 27. It is resulting therefrom that the coupling element 40 can be inserted into the through hole 33 only from the correct side.<br>
If the coupling element 40 is inserted into the through hole 33 from the wrong side, the coupling element 40 jams in the clamping portion 37 of the through hole. Therefore it is not possible to correctly clamp the wrongly inserted coupling element in the through hole 33.<br>
Hereinafter there will be considered the case according to which additional auxiliary switches or accessories switches for synchronous actuation are attached to an LS switch mounted on the holding rail not shown.<br>
In this context, the actuating members of switches stacked to each other are shown in the Fig. 2b to 2d. To put it more exactly, it is represented in Fig. 2b that further accessories switches or auxiliary switches are stacked to the left side of an LS switch (on the right in Fig. 2b).<br>
To this end, in each actuating member 20 of the accessories switches to be mounted first the coupling element 40 has been<br>

LS switcn need not be provided with any such coupling element 40.<br>
Subsequently the accessories switches are stacked one after the other via the assembly portions 12 thereof to the left side of the actuating member 20 of the LS switch, whereby the projection 42 of the actuating member of the first accessories switch is embedded in the through hole 33 of the actuating member of the LS switch. The projection 42 of the actuating member of the second accessories switch (the left switch in Fig. 2b) is inserted with positive fit in the recess 25 of the first accessories switch.<br>
According to the invention, the actuating members of such accessories switches can be modified in a simple manner such<br>
that they can be stacked not only - as shown by way of Fig. 2b<br>
-	to the left side of the LS switch but also to the right side<br>
of the LS switch, as it is illustrated in the following by way<br>
of Fig. 2c.<br>
It is shown in Fig. 2c how the actuating member 20 of a first accessories switch is mounted on the right side of an actuating member 20 (on the left in Fig. 2c) of the LS switch. To this end, the coupling element 40 in the actuating member of the accessories switch is displaced from the first assembly position shown in Fig. 2b to the second assembly position shown in Fig. 2c. As can be seen from Fig. 2c, in the second assembly position the projection 41 of the coupling element 40 protrudes into the through hole 33 of the actuating member of the LS switch.<br>
In accordance with the invention, it is not necessary in Fig. 2c either to provide the actuating member 20 of the LS switch with a coupling element for mounting and/or stacking the accessories switch.<br>

The coupling element 40 of this second accessories switch is -just as the coupling element 40 of the first accessories switch<br>
-	in the second assembly position. Consequently, in the second<br>
assembly position the projection 41 of the second accessories<br>
switch protrudes into a recess of the first accessories switch<br>
which is formed by the set-off 44 of the coupling element and<br>
the inner walls 22, 23 and 24 of the through hole 33 of the<br>
first accessories switch.<br>
In accordance with the Figures 2b and 2d, consequently the actuating members 20 of auxiliary switches can be adapted merely by displacing their coupling elements 40 so as to be stacked to both sides - i.e. to the right side or to the left side - of the LS switch. Such an installation-friendly stacking<br>
is also possible - as shown by way of Fig. 2d - between the actuating members of the accessories switches.<br>
Further it is possible hereby, of course, to mount auxiliary devices on both sides of an LS switch and to connect the actuating members thereof with the actuating member of the LS switch.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is shown in Figures 5a and 5b.<br>
Fig. 5a illustrates an LS switch comprising a toggle 10, an actuating member 20 and a release lever 60. The release lever 60 is movable about a swiveling axis 62 and includes a hole 61. The hole 61 may be a through hole and may have the same shape as the through hole 33 according to Fig. 3a, or on both sides of the release lever blind holes having the same shape as the end sections of the through hole 33 can be provided. As an alternative hereto, such a blind hole may have any shape suited for receiving the first or second end section 47, 50.<br>

A coupling element 40 as described in the foregoing in connection with the first embodiment can be inserted into this through hole in the same way.<br>
Moreover in the left and right housing walls of the LS switch and the switching means to be mounted openings (not shown) are provided which uncover the holes 61 and/or 33 over their entire motion track.<br>
In order to obtain a coupling between the switching means to be mounted and the LS switch, a coupling element 40 is inserted into the through hole 33 of the switching means to be mounted.<br>
Thus in the second embodiment, too, a simultaneous switching of the LS switch and the mounted switching device can be achieved.<br>
Also in this embodiment, of course,	a plurality of switching<br>
means can be mounted on one side of	the LS switch, or switching<br>
means can be mounted simultaneously	on both sides of the LS<br>
switch.<br>
For minimizing the wear of the coupling elements 40 the material of the coupling element 40 advantageously is metal. The coupling element therefore can be punched extremely easily and inexpensively of a metal sheet in a process suited for mass production. In such case the basic structure of the coupling element is cuboid-shaped.<br>
Instead of the coupling element used in the Figures 1 to 5, also other embodiments permitting a positive locking between adjacent actuating members 20 which are acting normal to the swiveling axis 11 are possible. The coupling element 40 in the shape of a cuboid shown in Fig. 6a includes, at the end section 47 above and beneath the t:-: ..i- of ;yy:::v..:'o:v '• , s-i..-of :  ••!•..•., •-'&gt;;:<br>

symmetry X. AL the opposite end section so projections 4la, 4lb forming a set-off 43 positioned symmetrically on the axis of symmetry X are provided above and beneath the axis of symmetry X so that the projection 42 fits in the set-off 43.<br>
As an alternative, it would also be possible to design the coupling element 40 according to Fig. 6b in the form of a cylinder. Accordingly, an end section 47 shaped as a journal 42 protruding from the base portion 51 along the axis of symmetry X is connected to the base portion 51. In the opposite end section 50 correspondingly the recess 43 is provided along the axis of symmetry X. In such case the recess 43 is formed independently of inner walls of the through hole 33 so that the positive fit acting normal to the swiveling axis 11 is produced merely between adjacent coupling elements 40.<br><br><br>
