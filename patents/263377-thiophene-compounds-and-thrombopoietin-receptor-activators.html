DESCRIPTION<br>
THIOPHENE COMPOUNDS AND THROMBOPOIETIN RECEPTOR<br>
ACTIVATORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to preventive, therapeutic and improving agents having affinity for and agonistic action on the thrombopoietin receptor for diseases against which activation of the thrombopoietin receptor is effective. Specifically, it relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds which increase platelets through stimulation of differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes or compounds for therapeutic angiogenesis or with anti-arteriosclerosis action that stimulate differentiation and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Thrombopoietin is a cytokine consisting of 332 amino acids that increases platelet production by stimulating differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes mediated by its receptor and therefore is promising as a<br><br>
2<br>
drug for hematological disorders. Recent reports that it stimulates differentiation and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells have raised expectations of therapeutic angiogenesis, anti-arteriosclerosis and prevention of cardiovascular events (for example, non-patent document 1, non-patent document 2 and non-patent document 3).<br>
Biologically active substances which have been known so far to regulate platelet production through the thrombopoietin receptor include, in addition to thrombopoietin itself, low molecular weight peptides having affinity for the thrombopoietin receptor (for example, patent document 1, patent document 2, patent document 3 and patent document 4).<br>
As a result of search for nonpeptidic low molecular weight compounds that increase platelet production mediated by the thrombopoietin receptor, low molecular weight compounds having affinity for the thrombopoietin receptor have been reported (for example, patent document 5 to patent document 26).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thrombopoietin and low molecular weight peptides having affinity for the thrombopoietin receptor are likely to be easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and are usually difficult to orally administer. As to thrombopoietin itself, the appearance of anti-thrombopoietin antibodies have been reported.<br>
Besides, though it is probably possible to orally administer nonpeptidic low molecular weight compounds, no practical drugs have been put on the market.<br><br>
5<br>
Therefore, orally administrable low molecular weight compounds having excellent affinity for and agonistic action on the thrombopoietin receptor as preventive, therapeutic and improving agents for diseases against which activation of the thrombopoietin receptor is effective have been demanded. Specifically, low molecular weight compounds which can serve as platelet increasing agents or increasing agents for other blood cells by stimulating differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes or low molecular weight compounds which can be used for therapeutic angiogenesis or as preventive and therapeutic agents for arteriosclerosis by stimulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells have been demanded.<br>
The present inventors conducted extensive research to find low molecular weight compounds having affinity for and agonistic action on the thrombopoietin receptor, and as a result, found that the compounds of the present invention have high affinity and agonistic action which enable them to show potent platelet increasing action by stimulating differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes.

EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The thiophene compounds of the present invention have affinity for and agonistic action on the thrombopoietin receptor and show potent platelet increasing action through stimulation of differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes.<br>
The thiophene compounds of the present invention are easily absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract and highly stimulate formation of megakaryocyte colonies. The orally absorbable thiophene compounds are retained in blood at high levels and therefore useful especially as oral medicines.<br>
Though patent document 26 discloses compounds having platelet increasing action, it does not disclose the thiophene compounds of the present invention specifically enough to predict the especially excellent oral absorbability and the excellent megakaryocyte colony stimulating activity of the thiophene compounds of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the thiophene compounds of the present invention are useful as medicines and used as preventive, therapeutic and improving agents for diseases against which activation of the thrombopoietin receptor is effective, especially as platelet increasing agents.<br><br>

ASSAY EXAMPLE 1<br>
Stimulation of Proliferation of a Thrombopoietin-dependent Cell Line<br>
The reactivity of the compounds of the Synthetic Examples of the present invention with thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor was assayed using a human leukemic cell line, UT7/EPO-mpl. (1) Cells and cell culture<br>
UT7/EPO-mpl is a stable transformed cell line obtained by introducing into human leukemic cell line UT7/EPO a vector that induces expression of human thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl) under control of cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter by the method of Takatoku et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 272:7259-7263 (1997)). Proliferation of this cell line is stimulated by thrombopoietin, while its mother cell line UT7/EPO exhibits no response to thrombopoietin. These two cell lines were subcultured in IMDM (GIBCO) containing 10% fet al bovine serum (Thermo Electron or BioWest) using a<br><br>
102 CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 37°C).<br>
(2) Cell proliferation assay<br>
The subcultured cells described above were washed twice with PBS and suspended in IMDM containing 10% fet al bovine serum at a cell density of 6 x 104 cells/mL. The cell suspension was transferred to a 96-well tissue culture plate (CORNING) in 100-l aliquots. Then either thrombopoietin (Pepro Tech EC) or the compounds of the Synthetic Examples dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted 83-fold with IMDM containing 10% fet al bovine serum and added to the aforementioned cell suspension in 20-l aliquots. The cell suspension was incubated in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 3 7°C) for 4 days. Cell proliferation was assayed using WST-8 reagent (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd.) according to instructions by the manufacturer. A 10-ul aliquot of 5 mM WST-8 reagent solution was added to each well of the tissue culture plate, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The formazan pigment generated was detected by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm with a 96-well microplate reader<br>
(Nihon Molecular Devices, Spectramax 190). Proliferation of thrombopoietin-responsive UT7/EPO-mpl cells was stimulated by the compounds of the Synthetic Examples of the present invention in a concentration-dependent manner, while no effect of the compounds of the Synthetic Examples on proliferation was observed with UT7/EPO, the mother cell line. These results indicate that the<br><br>
103<br>
compounds of the Synthetic Examples of the present invention act on the thrombopoietin receptor selectively as its activators.<br>
The compounds of Synthetic Examples 1 to 43 (in the free forms) were tested to determine the concentration of each compound that yields a growth rate corresponding to 50% of the growth of human leukemic cell line UT7/EP0-mpl observed in the presence of 10 ng/ml TPO (EC50). The compounds of Synthetic Examples 1 to 43 all had EC50 of about 10 ng/mL or below. ASSAY EXAMPLE 2<br>
Each of the compounds of the Synthetic Examples was suspended in a 99/1 liquid mixture of 0.5% methylcellulose/Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan Monooleate and orally administered to 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Japan SLC, Inc.) at a dose of 10 mg/kg/10 mL through a stomach tube. Between 0.5 and 2 hours after the administration of the compounds, blood was periodically collected from the cervical vein with heparin as the anticoagulant. The blood was centrifuged at 3500 min-1 for 10 minutes to obtain plasma. The plasma w-as added to the assay system used for assay of proliferation of a thrombopoietin-dependent cell line UT7/EPO-mpl in Assay Example 1 at final concentrations of from 0.1 to 3 %, and the cell proliferation was assayed. The concentration of each compound in plasma was calculated from the cell proliferation in the presence of<br><br>
104 plasma by comparison with a standard curve of cell<br>
proliferation versus compound concentration prepared for each compound or measured by LC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Agilent 1100 series LC/MS D). Each of the compounds of Synthetic Examples 1 to 16, 31 and 38 (Compounds of Synthetic Examples 31 and 38 were tested in the form of potassium salts) attained a maximum blood concentration (Cmax) of at least about 300 ng/mL 0.5 to 2 hours after the oral administration to rats. ASSAY EXAMPLE 3 Megakaryocyte Colony Stimulating Activity<br>
The action of the compounds of Synthetic Examples 1 to 43 of the present invention and Reference Synthetic Examples 29 and 30 on the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of megakaryocyte cells was measured by the megakaryocyte colony forming method using human bone marrow cells. Human bone marrow CD34+ cells (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville) were incubated on 2-well chamber<br>
slide for 11 days in a C02 incubator (5% CO2/ 37°C) using MegaCult™-C (StemCell Technologies) containing 0.1% (v/v) of the compounds of Synthetic Examples dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. After dehydration and fixation, the cells were stained with an anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibody in accordance with the instruction by the manufacturer. The colonies consisting of at least 8 stained megakaryocyte cells in each well were counted under a microscope. The megakaryocyte colony counts in<br><br>
105 at least 2 wells were averaged.<br>
The results demonstrate that the compounds of the present invention have excellent megakaryocyte colony stimulating activity and increase platelets through the activity.<br><br>
