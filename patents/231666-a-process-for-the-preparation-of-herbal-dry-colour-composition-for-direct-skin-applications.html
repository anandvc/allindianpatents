				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of herbal dry colour composition for direct skin application and other purposes.<br>
The newly formulated herbal dry colours provide an alternative to be used in Holi playing, cultural dances, rangoli and decoration purposes. More specifically, the invention relates to a process in which natural, eco-friendly, pharmaceutical and/or food grade ingredients are blended with natural dyes to yield synergistic mixture of dry colour powders. The resultant colour powders thus prepared have good sticking capacity to skin and can be easily removed with a soft mop. These dry colours have cosmetic effect on skin too as they make face feel a bit soft. The natural dyes used for blending are extracted from regenerative plant resources and forest-agro wastes. The natural dyes used are readily available in the Market. Natural dyes secreted by insects on plant species can also be used. Other than the natural dyes, other ingredients used are permitted non-synthetic, natural bulking agents / fillers and vegetable hydrocolloids. Permitted metallic salts are used as mordants and fixing agents within biological safe limits. The production profile of the dry colours is eco-friendly as no toxic effluents are released during preparation and do not disturb the ecological balance.<br>
Presently there is great trend towards the use of natural colours throughout the world. All this happened due to the excessive use of synthetic dyes which is estimated around 10,00,000 tones per annum whose production and application release vast amount of waste and unfixed colourant causing health hazard, pollution and disturb eco-balance. Govenment of Germany was the first to take initiative to put ban on azo-dyes for manufacturing, dyeing and importing textile and other consumer goods dyed with these dyes. Reference may be made to German Legislation (Consumer Goods Ordinance) w.e.f. January 1, 1995. Netherlands followed with a ban with effect from August 1, 1996 on similar lines. Reference may be made to Clothesline, September 1996, pp 13. European Union is likely to impose ban on these toxic dyes shortly. India has also banned the use of 70 odd azo-dyes and under notification "sufficient legal teeth" had been given<br>
for taking panel action against those who use these dyes. Reference may be made to clause (d) of sub-section (2) of section six of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, read with rule 13 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 w.e.f. June 23, 1997. Certain chemicals e.g. pentachlorophenol, formaldehyde, benzidine, hexachlorobenzene, aldrin, polychlororinated biphenyls etc. and their derived compounds numbering about 118 have already been included in Red-List and banned. References may be made to G.D.Premi, Clothline, September, 1996, pp. 105 and S.Subramanian and G.R. Phalgumani, Proceedings Seminar on Eco-Eriendly Textile: Challenges to the textile Industry, Textile Committee, Ministry of Textiles, Bombay, pp 1-10. In view to preserve public health and protect environment, a lobby of environmentalists, educationists, scientists, social workers, non-government organizations (N.G.O.'s) are creating awareness towards the revival of natural dyes.<br>
As far as natural colours or vegetable dyes are concerned, India had a virtual monopoly in their production and applications. Dyeing and printing was a craft up to the middle of 19th century and India has a very rich tradition of using natural dyes. There are many references in our literature and calico printing is an example. References are also available for silk dyeing with natural colours in China before 2600 BC. Caves of Ajanta and Bagh ( 6th century AD ) are undoubted proof of the natural colours. Numerous specimens of dyeing and printing of ancient period are still available in the museums. References may be made to Indian Paintings, ed. Hans Zbindon, IRIS Colour Books, French edition, Librairei Plon, Paris; B.M.Phadke, History of dyes and dyeing in Bombay Presidency, Dastane Brothers Home Service, Pune, 1947; B.C.Mohanty, K.V.Chandramouli and H.D.Naik, Natural dyeing processing in India, Calico Museum Of Textiles, Ahemdabad, 1984; R.B.Chavan, Colourage, April 1995, pp 27-30 and M.L.Gulrajani and Deepti Gupta, Natural dyeing and their applications, I.I.T., Delhi.<br>
After the advent of synthetic dyes in middle of 19th century, natural dyes were forgotten and abandoned as a part of history due to neglect for about 150 years. It is only<br>
during the last one and half decade, when concern for environment created an interest in natural dyes, its production and R&amp;D. Plant wealth is the main source of colours and there are more than 300 species, which yield dyes. There are lot of references available in literature, some of them are as follows: Wealth of India-Raw Materials, Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research (C.S.I.R.), New Delhi, gives most of the details about availability of raw materials, chemistry and application; Compendium of Inter-Regional Workshop on Natural Dyes, ed.

There are about one dozen foreign companies offering natural dyes and information is available on websites such as http://www.hillcreek.com: http://www.greene.xtn.net/-fibre/dves.html. and http://www.cybertap.com.<br>
In India, Alps Industries Limited, Ghaziabad ( http://www.alpind.com ); Eco-Care, Lucknow, Aranya, Srishti, Kerala; D. Manoharlal (Shellac) Pvt. Ltd., Sakti, M.P.; TCoN, Auroville, Tamil Nadu and others also manufacturing natural dyes. Some of the companies have developed extraction procedures that yield pure liquid dyes, which are converted to dry powders. Information about natural dye extracts and mordants are available on internet at website such as http://www.handspinning.com/stef/dyes.htm. One can also chat on subject at various chat forums viz. http://countrylife.net/ethnobotany/.<br>
Natural dyes are mainly used for dyeing textile, jute, hosiery, bed linen, curtains, carpets, leather and other consumer goods. Printing and designing is also very important area, which popularized the use of these colours. Referencves may be made to different series of Wealth of India-Raw Materials, Council of scientific &amp; Industrial Research<br>

No reference has been found regarding availability of dry colour powders prepared using natural dyes and natural ingredients for direct skin application.<br>
Dry colours are used world over in various festivals, dances and household decoration. For example, a large amount of colours are used in traditional Holi playing and under the present scenario almost 99% of colours used are synthetic. The dry colours (gulals) available in market is usually of non standard specifications and parameters and the quality of colours are unsatisfactory for direct skin and face application. All the blended dry colours (gulals) available in market for Holi playing are synthetic-dye-based in which clay, sand, chalk, starch etc. are used as ingredients. According to the reports of Industrial Toxicological Research Center (ITRC), Lucknow, published in The Hindustan Times, February 21, 2000 and Kuber Times, March 9, 2000, colours used in Holi contain appreciable amount of toxic and harmful chemicals. The fast colours available at the time of Holi are made from chemicals / dyes which are meant for paint and dyeing. These colours are harmful to skin and eyes. Several harmful synthetic dyes have been used for the preparation of colours for Holi purpose viz. auramine (for yellow), malachite (for green), rhodamine B (for orange), methylene violet (for violet), methylele blue (for blue)<br>
or blend.of these. As there are no strict regulations, there is every likelihood that some other harmful and banned dyes are being used. The direct application of these dry colours on face and skin often cause eye-irritation, allergies, skin infection and respiratory problems. Moreover after washing, toxic effluents are released which pollute environment and cause health hazard.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of herbal dry colour composition for direct skin application and other purposes, which obviates the drawback noted above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein natural dyes and ingredients are used to replace the use of synthetic based dry colours in Holi playing, traditional dances and other purposes which cause considerable health hazard and environment pollution.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process which is eco-friendly and does not disturb the eco-system.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide ample opportunity to utilize our agro-forest wastes and un-utilized regenerative plant wealth for the production of vegetable dye based dry colours.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a synergistic composition of dry colour powders comprising of natural dyes and natural ingredients with good sticking capacity to skin, which can be removed by a soft mop.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein the natural dyes and ingredients used are easily available in market as these are used extensively in various industries and their extraction procedures are well known.<br>
In another object of the present invention the synthetic dye based gulals are replaced by natural dyes which can be manufactured in large scale and also at cottage level.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide people, who are allergic to synthetic colours, an opportunity to enjoy the festival of Holi.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of natural dry colour composition for direct skin application which comprises:<br>
a)	preparing a colour solution of 50-150 gm of natural dye as herein before<br>
described in 250-500 ml. of warm water, adding 2 to 10% known mordants to the<br>
solution, stirring the solution to obtain homogenous colour solution, filtering the<br>
resultant solution, adding to the filtrate under stirring 10 to 20 volume % of 0.5-<br>
2.0 % of gum solution as herein   before described to obtain a dispersed dye<br>
solution,<br>
b)	preparing a homogeneous mixture of bulking agent of 50 to 90 wt.% of I.P. grade<br>
steatite, 9 to 49 wt.% of food grade starch and filler of 1 to 10 wt.% of food grade<br>
gum, passing the said mixture through 80 to 100 mesh-size sieve, adding polar<br>
solvent as herein described at 60- 70°C to the sieved mixture to obtain thin slurry,<br>
c)	blending the slurry obtained in step (b) with the dispersed dye solution obtained<br>
in step (a), at a temperature in the range of 60 to 100°C under constant stirring for<br>
a period of 1 to 3 hours to obtain a uniform coloured residue, filtering the said<br>
residue followed by drying and grinding to 70 to 100 mesh-size colored powder,<br>
optionally adding a fragrance agent as herein described to obtain natural dry<br>
colour composition, the said process is characterized by the use of natural dye,<br>
steatite and starch as bulking agent and food grade gum as filler.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the natural dye used may be from vegetable and animal / insect sources.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the vegetable dyes used may be extracted<br>
from plant material such as:<br>
Common name	Botanical name	Part used<br>
Indigo	Indigofera tinctoria Linn.	Whole plant<br>
Cutch	Acacia catechu Willd	Heartwood<br>
Lai Khair	A. Chundra (Roxb.) Willd	Wood<br>
Tesu	Butea monosperma Lam (Kuntz.)      Flower<br>
Palas	B. superba Roxb.	Flower<br>
Turmeric	Cucurma longa Linn.	Rhizome<br>
Marigold	Tagetes erect a Linn.	Flower<br>
Harrar	Terminalia chebula Retz.	Fruit<br>
Manjeeth	Rubia cordifolia Linn.	Root<br>

Mahendi	Lawsonia inermis Linn.	Leaves<br>
Anar	Punica granatum Linn.	Fruit rind<br>
Annato	Bixa orellana Linn.	Fruit<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention animal / insect dye used may be<br>
such as lac dye, kerm dye and cochineal dye.<br>
The vegetable dyes have been used since ages in traditional systems of medicines,<br>
food and cosmetics. There are many other plant species, which yield colours and can also<br>
be used after suitable trials under safety parameters and ecological factors. The natural<br>
dyes obtained from animal sources may be through twigs inhabited by insects resulting in<br>
lac dye, kerm dye and cochineal dye.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the gum used may be any of<br>
binding and thickening agent which provides affinity between dye and bulking agent, any<br>
of the food hydrocolloids such as guar gum, alginates, cassia seed gums.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the bulking agent / filler used<br>
may be may be which is the mixture of following ingredients:<br>
i)        96 % pure, I.P. grade steatite powder;<br>
ii)        food grade starch such as obtained from arrowroot, maize, potato;<br>
iii)      food grade gum such as guar gum, alginates, cassia seed gums.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the polar solvents used may be<br>
such as water, acetone and primary and secondary alcohols or mixture thereof.<br>
The herbal dry colour composition can be prepared using water only for cottage industry but to facilitate rapid and large scale manufacture, other polar solvents can be used.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention a fragrance agent such as natural oil extracted from rose, sandalwood, lemon grass may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment .of the present invention darker shades may be obtained by repeating the process by substituting the bulking agents / fillers with the coloured powder obtained.<br>
In order to accelerates the affinity of dye towards the natural ingredients and also provide different shades depending upon dye used and its concentration. 2-10 % (of the weight of dye) of any one or more of the following mordants can be used depending upon specific dye and shade required; sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, alum, boric acid and tannic acid. Other mordants like potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, barium chloride, aluminum sulphate, copper sulphate, acetic acid, ferric chloride, stannous chloride, potassium dichromate etc may also be used but their use is not recommended since they are not soft on skin and not in eco-parameters.<br>
The herbal dry colour composition prepared by the process of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having property, which are different from the mere aggregated properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
The detailed steps of the process of present invention are given below: Step 1: Dispersion of dye solution:<br>
The natural dye (50 - 150 g, depending upon shade required) is taken in 250 -500 ml beaker and a thick paste is made with minimum quantity of hot water using spatula. The paste is transferred to 2-3 liter beaker and volume is adjusted to 500 - 1000 ml using warm water. 2 to 10 % of mordant(s) (on dye weight basis) is added to the solution. The solution is kept over boiling water bath for 2 -5 hours with continuous<br>
stirring till a homogeneous colour solution is obtained. The resulting solution was filtered and mixed with 100-200 ml of 0.5-2.0 % of gum solution under stirring for 15 to 30 minutes. In the case of indigo dye, its colour is extracted by fermentation. Step 2 : Preparation of fillers / bulking agents:<br>
450 - 600 g of filler powder containing 50 - 90 % of steatite (96 %; I.P.grade), 9-49 % of starch (food grade) and 1 - 10 % of guar gum (food grade) are mixed in mixer for 15 minutes and passed to 80-100 mesh-size. Sufficient amount of warm (60-70° C) polar solvent is added to the filler mixture till thin slurry is obtained using a mixer for 15-30 minutes. Step 3 : Blending of dyes and filler material:<br>
The resulting ingredient slurry is added slowly to warm dye solution with continuous stirring for 1 - 3 hours. The synergistic mixture is agitated vigorously upto 1 hour till a uniform coloured residue is obtained. The residue is filtered, dried in air and finally under vacuum oven at 60-70° C for 7 to 15 hours till it dried completely. The residue is powdered to 70-100 mesh-size. Darker shades of the powder can be obtained by repeating cycles of treating the dry powder with dye in above manner. Finally, if desired, 0.1 - 0.4 % of rose, sandal wood or lemon grass oil can be mixed for fragrance purpose.<br>
The above procedure is novel as steatite and starch are taken together as bulking materials along with a natural thickening and binding agents such as guar gum or other food hydrocolloids. This combination provides a powaer material navmg son and supple touch with good sticking capacity to skin. No such combination has been reported till now. The blending of bulking agents / fillers with activated natural dye solution with mordants in the presence of guar or other gums provides a synergistic mixture of dry colour powder having desirable properties to be used for direct skin application. The use of guar gum or other gum is based on the fact that it possesses excessive hydroxyl groups in the sugar moieties of main and side chains, which provides hydrogen bonding in the<br>
formation of syncrgistic mixture of the dyes and ingredients. The inventive steps of the invention is the selection of natural ingredients of I.P. and food grade level in specific proportion and their blending with natural dyes in the presence of natural thickening and binding agents. There is no reference available for the use of guar gum and other food grade gum for the preparation of dry colour powders. Moreover by the above procedure, a wide range of herbal dry colour compositions can be prepared using different amounts of natural dyes with natural ingredients in different proportions. The mixture of steatite, starch and seed gum after blending with natural dyes in the presence of dye fixing agent and binding agent provides a combination which has a good sticking capacity to skin and can be easily removed by soft mop. The dry colours have cosmetic effect on skin too as it make face feel a bit soft. The filler combination having higher amount of steatite with lesser amount of starch provides a high grade of dry powder.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
 Preparation of herbal dry colour composition using indigo dye:<br>
100 g of natural indigo dye extracted from Indigofera tinctoria is powdered and taken in 550 ml of water with stirring. 4.5 g of sodium bicarbonate and 1.8 g of sodium carbonate is added to solution. The solution is kept for 10 hour at room temperature and ingredients are stirred after each 15 minutes. The resultant blue solution is filtered and mixed with 100 ml of 1.0 % guar gum solution under continuous stirring for 30 minutes.<br>
500 g of steatite : arrowroot starch : guar gum (85 : 13 : 2) is taken in a beaker and treated in a mixer for 15 minutes and passed through 80 mesh-size. The resultant powder is treated with sufficient amount of warm water (65° C) in a mixer for 15 minutes till thin slurry is obtained. The dye solution is added to this slurry by continuous stirring for one hour and again agitated for one hour. The residue is filtered through a sintered funnel under vacuum and dried in vacuum oven at 70° C for 10 hours. The resultant blue residue<br>
is powdered to 90 mesh-size. Dark shades of the powder can be obtained by repeating cycles of treating the dry powder with dye in above manner.<br>
EXAMPLE -2<br>
Preparation of herbal dry colour composition using kamala dye: 75 g of powdered kamala dye taken in 500 ml beaker and a thick paste is made with hot water (80° C) using spatula. The paste is transferred to a 2 liter beaker using 500 ml of water (80° C) and 4.8 g of sodium bicarbonate is added. The solution is kept over boiling water bath for 4 hours with continuous stirring followed by filtration. The dye solution is mixed with 100 ml of 0.5 % alginate solution and stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. 500 g of steatite : arrowroot starch : guar gum (88 : 11 : 1) is taken in a beaker and treated in a mixer for 15 minutes and passed through 80 mesh-size. The resultant powder is treated with sufficient amount of warm water (70° C) in a mixer for 20 minutes till thin slurry is obtained. The dispersed dye solution is added to the slurry with continuous stirring for 2 hours. The resultant mixture is well stirred at 70° C for 1 hour. The residue is collected by filtration through sintered funnel in vacuum followed by drying in vacuum oven at 70° C for 12 hour. The mixture is powdered to 90 mesh-size. The resultant dry powder is yellow in colour; its shade can be changed by variation in the amount of dye used. Dark shades of the powder can be obtained by repeating cycles of treating the dry powder with dye in above manner.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Preparation of herbal dry powder composition using cutch dye: 70 g of powdered cutch dye is taken in 500 ml beaker and a thick paste is made with hot water (80° C) using spatula. The paste is transferred to a 2 liter beaker using 525 ml of water (80° C) and 3.9 g of sodium bicarbonate and 1.5 g of sodium carbonate are are added. The mixture is kept over boiling water bath for 3 hours with continuous stirring. The dye solution was filtered and mixed with 100 ml of 1.5 % cassia gum solution and stirred for 15 minutes. 500 g of ingredients (steatite : starch : cassia gum ::<br>
86 : 12 ; 2 ) are treated in a mixer for 15 minutes and passed through 100 mesh-size sieve. The filler mixture is transferred to a 3 liter beaker and mixed with 550 ml of acetone with continuous stirring at 65° C for 30 minutes till thin slurry is obtained. The dye solution is added slowly to this slurry with continuous stirring for 1 hour at 60° C and again stirred for 1 hour. The residue is filtered through a sintered funnel under vacuum followed by drying in vacuum oven at 70° C for 7 hours and crushing to 90 mesh-size powder. The resultant residue has a dull pink colour. Brown colour dry powder composition can be obtained by using water instead of acetone. Dark shades of the powder can be obtained by repeating cycles of treating the dry powder with dye in above manner. The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1)	It provides an option to replace synthetic dye based dry colour composition by<br>
natural ones, which is safe, stain-free and eco-friendly. Presently, there are no<br>
options except to use synthetic based colours.<br>
2)	The powder provides a synergistic mixture of coloured dry powder which has<br>
good sticking capacity to skin and can be easily removed by soft mop. The dry<br>
colours have cosmetic effect on skin too as it make face feel a bit soft.<br>
3)	The dry colours are eco-friendly and can be prepared under eco-friendly<br>
processing without disturbing eco-system.<br>
4)	The dry colours provide ample opportunity for the utilization of regenerative plant<br>
resources and forest / agro wastes which ultimately enhance opportunity for self-<br>
employment for rural people.<br>
5)	The process is novel as natural dyes have been exploited for the first time for the<br>
