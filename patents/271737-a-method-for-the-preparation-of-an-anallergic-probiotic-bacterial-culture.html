METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF ANALLER6IC PROBIOTIC<br>
BACTERIAL CULTURES AND RELATED USE *****<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The aim of the present invention is a method for the preparation of anallergic probiotic bacterial cultures .<br>
It is known that the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains a complex microbial, community, called micro-biota, mainly consisting of strictly anaerobic bacteria capable of playing different actions with effects which affect the local gastrointestinal level and indirectly the general systemic level, involving almost all the organs and the host functions.<br>
The intestinal microflora, consisting of a large variety of different species (400-500) capable to colonize both the intestinal mucosa and the particles of ingested food, is then able to strongly condition the health of the individual.<br>
The composition of the intestinal microflora can be altered by several factors, such as the age, the physiological condition of the individual, the presence of • different pathologies, the stress and above all the diet. As a consequence of endogenous and exogenous negative<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-2-<br>
factors, there is a decrease of the useful bacteria (typically bacteria belonging to the lactic acid group_<br>
in the small intestine and bifidobacteria in the large<br>
( intestine) and an increase of pathogenic enterobacte-<br>
ria, streptococci and clostridia.<br>
The administration of specific probiotics through me-.dicinal specialties, dietetics, integrators and above all food (so-called "functional" or "nutraceutic" foods) allows to re-equilibrate the microflora of the host, by restoring an optimal intestinal functionality.<br>
The term "probiotic" commonly relates to living microorganisms, selected from the intestinal microflora of healthy individuals, which once administered in opportune quantities and for an adequate time, are able to colonize, also if only temporarily, the different tracts of the intestine and to impart beneficial effect to the health of the host organism. Belonging to the probiotics are mainly some species of the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococ- ' cus, Pediococcus, Lactococcus, Propionibacterium, Leuconostoc and, in a lower extent, Saccharomyces, Bacillus and Enterococcus.<br>
Between the healthy and beneficial effects, shown by severe clinical tests carried out all over the world<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
—3—<br>
and induced in the consumer by the intake of probiot-ics there can be mentioned:<br>
1.	Stimulation of the immune system;<br>
t<br>
2.	Induction of antimutagenic and antigenotoxic ef<br>
fects;<br>
3.	Antitumoral and antimetastatic action referring,<br>
for example, to:<br><br>
-	large intestine carcinoma<br>
-	breast carcinoma<br>
-	bladder cancer<br><br>
4.	Iprovement in the nutrients absorption;<br>
5.	Decrease of the lactose intolerance symptoms;<br>
6.	Improvement of the intestinal mo'tility due to the<br>
lowering of the pH and decrease of the constipation;<br>
7.	Decrease of the absorption of cholesterol and fats;<br>
8.	Antidiarrhoic, anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic ac<br>
tivities inhibiting infections of the female urogeni-<br>
tal system;<br>
9.	Prevention activity of geriatric pathologies.<br>
The probiotics for oral use must be characterized by the following general and functional requirements: i) human intestinal origin; from individuals in good health conditions;<br>
ii) bio-safety; they must not cause side effects especially in weakened or immune depressed persons;<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-4-<br>
•iii) Resistance and viability; they must have such resistance features to be. able to survive the gastric<br>
juice, the pancreatic and bile secretions so as to<br>
•i reach the ileum and the colon 'in an undamaged way and<br>
still perfectly viable.<br>
The competition which begins between probiotic microorganisms and pathogenic microflora can only occur if, once ingested, the probiotic microorganisms are able to reach the intestinal tract and therefore to survive the gastric acidity and the high concentration of the bile salts. Generally, once they have reached the intestinal tract, they are said to begin through adhesion mechanisms which involve proteins and/or carbohydrates with specific adhesion functionalities to the intestinal villi.<br>
At industrial level, the probiotics are produced in form of freeze dried bacterial culture, namely the growth of the cells in a proper medium is determined<br>
i<br>
(fermentation) and next, following to concentration and purification of the biomass, the dehydration of the same is performed by freeze- drying. Such process is required for allowing the bacteria to reproduce themselves in an adequate number (fermentative step) and to preserve themselves for a long time (freeze drying step).<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-5-<br>
In order that the fermentative process is successfully carried out and with adequate yields, it is nec-egsary to provide the cells with carbon and nitrogen sources, oligo-elements and bioactivators in opportune quantities.<br>
Traditionally, dealing with commonly said "lactic" bacteria, the selected substrates used as a nitrogenous source are serum, milk serum-proteins, hydro-lyzates and casein peptones, caseinates, etc., while as a carbon source, lactose and glucose are usually employed, as they can easily be metabolized from almost all the living organisms.<br>
In the last years, probably also because of a diet too little varied and too rich in proteins and lipids, in Europe and Western countries a sensitive increase of the number of persons suffering from allergic-type pathologies has been registered.<br>
The immune reactions of type IV or IgE-mediated are<br><br>
called "allergic", during which, following to a first sensitizing contact (which can occur in any time of the life, also the intrauterine one) specific IgEs are produced with a histamine-mediated mechanism. Such reactions can be also caused by extremely reduced doses of molecules called "allergens", with clinical consequences which can change from simple slight skin<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-6-<br>
reactions to anaphylactic shock and dead.<br><br>
Due to the dangerousness of these substances for some people, the European Community has adopted a rule such<br>
that in the label "the use in the production and the presence in the food" of foods belonging to the following classes (Annex III bis of the above instruction) has to be clearly shown (art. 6 sub. 10, instruction 2000/13/EC thus modified by the instruction 2003/89/EC)<br>
gluten-containing cereals (that is wheat, rye, barley, oat, spelt, kamut or their hybridized strains) and derived products; Crustacea and crustacea-based products,- eggs and eggs-based ^products; fish and fish-based products; peanuts and peanut-based products; soy and soy-based products; milk and milk-based products (including the lactose); fruits with shell, that is almonds (Amigdalus communis L.)r hazelnuts (Corylus avellana) , common walnuts (Juglans regia), acagiu walnuts (Western Anacardium), pecan walnuts [Carya illi-noiesis (Wangenh) K. Koch], Brazil walnuts (Ber-tholletia excelsa), pistachio nuts (Pistacia vera), Queensland walnuts (Macadamia ternifolia) and derived products; celery and celery-based products; mustard and mustard-based products;\ sesame seeds and sesame seeds-based products; sulfur dioxide and sulphites in<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-7-<br>
concentrations higher than 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/1 expressed as SO2  <br>
As, typically for the production of probiotics, sub-<br>
i strates based on milk (as a nitrogenous source) and<br>
glucose (as a carbon source), which is usually originated from the starch (also wheat starch), derivatives are used, the probiotics can be considered dangerous if administered to particularly sensitive subjects, even if, at the most, they actually could contain only small traces of allergens (therefore derived from milk and/or gluten).<br>
In case of milk, there can be individualized two causes of adverse reaction to this food; the cow's milk proteins allergy (APLV) and the lactose intolerance.<br>
The milk, together with the egg, is the more allergis-ing food; this feature thereof is determined by the proteinic substances contained by the same, that is mainly alfa-lactoalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin and caseins.<br>
The allergy to the cow's milk proteins is a relatively frequent pathology in the first year of life. The symptomatology is, in the 50-70% of the cases, of a gastroenteric type, yet in the 50-70% of the cases there are skin disorders, in the 20-30% respiratory<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-8-<br>
disorders and in the 5-9% systemic disorders (anaphy-laxis).<br>
The APLV tends to fade itself after the first year of<br>
{	<br>
life and to disappear towards the 10 years and is unusual in the adults.<br>
An opposite course has the lactose intolerance, which is- very unusual in the-first year of life and very. -frequent in the adult, in particular in some populations (African, Asiatic, American Indian). The milk is a fundamental food since the birth and the new-born already produces the enzyme necessary for the fission of the milk sugar, the lactose, in its simple components glucose and galactose. After the first year of life, the milk becomes a less important food and the lactase is spontaneously reduced, such that many adults become intolerant (not allergic) to the milk. The celiac disease is an enterophatic, chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease, risen from the in-gestion of gluten, a "storage" protein naturally contained in some cereals.<br>
This food intolerance affects genetically predisposed persons, having an immune•system which responds in an abnormal way to the ingestion of proteinic fractions typical of the wheat gluten, spelt (a kind of wheat), kamut and spella (a kind of wheat), -barley, rye,<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-9*-<br>
triticale (a cross between wheat and rye) and their derivatives. Some individuals also present intolerance<br>
to the oat proteins.<br><br>
Technically the term "gluten" applies for the combination of the simple prolaminic (rich in proline), called ""gliadins", and glutelinic {rich in glutamine) , called "glutenins", proteins of the cereals above mentioned.<br>
In the context of the celiac disease, the term "gluten" is often used with reference to all kinds of proteins contained in the cereals, even if between the different proteinic fractions which form the gluten, the gliadin seems to be the most detrimental. In the people affected by the celiac disease, the assumption of gluten, also in small quantities, is capable of causing the abnormal response of the immune system: the transglutaminase, an enzyme existing in the intestinal mucosal tissue, binds to the gliadin and through deamidation transforms it in a molecule capable of activating the T cells (cells of the immune<br>
system capable of mediating all- the immune responses<br>
i<br>
towards the proteinic antigens), with a consequent production of anti-transglutaminase IgG and IgA and anti-endomise IgA immunoglobulins. In a first stage, an increase of the intraepithelial<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-10-<br>
intestinal activated T cells occurs, while with the progress of the disease tha increase relates both to the lymphocytes and the infiltrated plasma cells of the own lamina, with a production of metallopro-teinases responsible for the shortening of the villi and therefore the damage to the intestinal mucosa. The possibility of preventing the development or treating the celiac disease does not exist so far, therefore a gluten-free diet, strictly carried out for all the lifetime is the only therapy capable of ensuring to the people affected by the celiac disease a perfect health.<br>
The celiac persons must eliminate also the smallest<br><br>
traces of flour of the dangerous cereals, because the intake of gluten, also in minimal quantities, can unbridle the autoimmune response.<br>
As the ratio of the quantity of ingested gluten to the toxic effect induced at the intestinal level has still not been defined, the term "traces" has a fundamental practical importance in the treatment of the celiac disease and implications on the food legislation plan, because it is related at the maximum limit of "acceptable" gluten (threshold) in the products suitable .for the diet of the celiac person. All the skilled persons<br>
•<br>
agree that a dose of 100 mg per day of gliadin, equal<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-11-<br>
to 200 mg of gluten, i.e. about 3 g of bread, is sufficient to cause, in most of the celiac persons, the<br>
increase of the intestinal intraepithelial lympho-<br>
j<br>
cytes, a premature sign of persistent intestinal inflammation.<br>
With reference to the minimum threshold, the few scientific works carried out so .far would seem to show, that the ingestion up to 10 milligrams per day of gli-adin (equal to 20 parts per.million of gluten) is not capable of sensitively damaging the intestinal mucosa, but can determine, in a minority of the cases, the gastroenteric symptoms occurrence.<br>
At the international legislative level, the old standard "Codex Standard for Gluten-Free Foods", still in force, shows, as the maximum gluten content in the diet-therapeutic products, 0.05 of nitrogen per 100 g of dry product (with reference to the wheat starch), which corresponds to a gluten fraction equal to about 500 ppm.<br>
However, a right and proper review of the aforesaid guide line is taking place*, which seems to foresee that the gluten-free foods resulting from naturally gluten-free ingredients have not to contain more than 20 ppm of gluten, while the gluten-free foods, deriving from cereals with gluten, can have a maximum limit<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-12-<br>
of 200 ppm of gluten.<br>
In France, Great Britain and the Netherlands, waiting for the review of the aforesaid guide line, they consider, as the maximum limit for the gluten-free products, 200 ppm.<br>
In the national ambit, the current rule seems to be more precautionary than the community and interna-_ tional one, in fact a limit of "20 parts per million", both for the foods manufactured with raw materials naturally free from gluten and the foods purified from such substance, is established.<br>
The rule foresees that "if, in the composition of the food product or in that of one or more ingredients (flavourings, additives or co-adjuvants) which form the same, are present cereals containing gluten or substances deriving therefrom and/or if from the productive process a quantity of gluten can derive in the end product, analytically determined as higher than 20 parts per million, such product will have to show in the label, at the foot of the ingredients list and in a well visible way, the words "gluten-containing product".<br>
The complete exclusion of the gluten from the diet is not however easy to carry out, considering that cross-contamination phenomena of cereals and derivatives<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-13-<br>
(starches, flours, starch flour, etc.) naturally free<br>
from gluten, already at the. milling industry level,<br>
can occur.<br>
Such products are then used by the food industry in the preparation of complex foods based on multiple technological ingredients, additives and co-adjuvants of different origin and nature.<br>
A recent research has shown that up to 6% of the "theoretically" gluten-free products, based on the reported ingredients, actually contain over 30 mg of gliadin per 100 g of end product, equal to 600 ppm of gluten.<br>
For the purpose of excluding .a possible gluten-contamination, it is therefore necessary to consider, for each commercialized food product, not only all the ingredients used and the processing, but also all the productive chain of each single ingredient. Therefore, there remains the need of being able to produce probiotic bacterial cultures free from aller-gising substances due to the use of fermentative substrates based on milk or cereals or, alternatively, due to unintentional or cross-contaminations. In fact, it is nevertheless possible that, due to cross-, unintentional and accidental contaminations, some components used in the productive process brings allergens<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCIYIT2006/000574<br>
-14-      •   -<br>
traces.<br>
Therefore, there remains the need of being able to<br>
provide a method for the preparation of probiotic bac-<br>
terial cultures which foresees, in each step of the<br>
productive process, including the fermentation, the use of anallergic substances. In particular, it is desirable to locate and select fermentative substrates, different from milk and its derivatives and the gluten-containing cereals, which represent a good nitrogen and carbon source.<br>
Therefore, all the sector operators agree that, so far, there remains a very strong need of providing a method for the preparation of probiotic bacterial cultures capable of using substrates alternative to those used until today and, simultaneously, capable of reducing the cross-, unintentional and accidental contaminations, should they occur.<br>
In particular, there remains the need of providing a method for the preparation of probiotic bacterial cultures which foresees a doubly level of safety relating to the absence of allergising substances. An aim of the present invention is to provide a method for the preparation of culture media capable of overcoming the limits of the known aft. Another aim of the present invention is to provide a<br><br>

-15-<br>
methodology for the production of probiotic bacterial cultures safe to administer to all the population, also to the people affected by allergies. These and other aims, which will result apparent from the following detailed description, have been attained by the Applicant, which has improved a methodology<br>
which includes a double safety level relating to the	<br>
absence of allergens in the productive processes of probiotic bacterial cultures.<br>
In particular, the Applicant has set up a production methodology in which selected anallergic fermentation substrates (anallergic raw materials) are used, capable of ensuring a proper nitrogen and carbon source to the probiotic cultures.<br>
A method for the preparation of an anallergic probiotic bacterial cultures, a composition including said culture and the use of said culture for the preparation of so-called "functional" or "nutraceutic" foods form the subject of the present invention, having the features as defined in the appended claims. In an embodiment of the invention, the strains of said bacterial culture belong to the genera: Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, Lactococ-cus, Propionibacterium, Bacillus, Saccharomyces, En-terococcus, Leuconostoc.<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-16-<br>
Preferably, of the genus Lactobaclllus, the following species have found use: L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L.<br>
casei, L. casei ssp. paracasei, L. easel ssp. rhamno-<br>
susr L. acldophilus, L. delbrueckil ssp. bulgaricus,<br>
L. fermentum, L. gasseri.<br>
Examples of used strains of said species are reported in the enclosed Table 1. Preferably, of the genus Bi-fldobacterluiar the following species have found use: B. longum. B. breve, B. lactis, B. adolescentis and B. pseudocatenulaturn.<br>
Examples of used strains of said species are reported in the enclosed Table 1. Preferably, of the genus Lac-toc'occus the following species have found use: L. lactis and L. lactis ssp. Lactis.<br>
Examples of used strains of safcid species are reported in the enclosed Table 1. Preferably, of the genus Streptococcus the following species have found use: S. thermophllus.<br>
Examples of used strains of said species are reported in the enclosed Table 1.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the bacteria of said bacterial culture are selected from the group including the probiotic bacterial strains reported in the enclosed Table 1. The Applicant has found useful to select and employ<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-17-<br>
particular anallergic raw materials. In 'particular, the Applicant has found, as a nitrogen source, peptones and/or proteinic hydrolyzates of vegetal and/or<br><br>
animal origin, naturally free from gluten and allergens of milky origin and, as a carbon source, glucose and/or other mono- or disaccAarides derived from the hydrolysis of more complex polysaccharides typical of vegetal species naturally free from gluten and allergens of milky origin.<br>
The peptones of vegetal origin are selected from the group including: rice, potato, maize, chestnuts, tapioca, manioca, pea, broad beans and their mixtures however capable of promoting the fermentation" bacterial growth, but without producing allergens, either of milky nor gluten types. In a first preferred embodiment, the method subject of<br>
the present invention foresees the use, as a nitrogen<br><br>
source, of one or more peptones and/or anallergic proteinic hydrolyzates and, as a carbon source, glucose and/or other mono- or disaccharides derived from hydrolysis of complex polysaccharide (anallergic raw materials) .<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, the method subject of the present invention foresees a pre-treatment of the raw materials with enzymes suitable for the re-<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-18-<br>
moval of traces, if any, of allergens deriving from cross-contamination occurred along the productive and/or distributive chain.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the culture substrate is an anallergic culture, substrate of vegetal and/or animal origin, naturally free from gluten, allergens or milky. origin and all the substances belonging to the list of the annex III bis of the instructions (anallergic raw materials) above mentioned. The use of anallergic raw materials above mentioned allows to obtain certifiable probiotics for the use in allergic persons, as the non-use of substances belonging to the list of the annex III bis of the aforesaid community instructions and the use of ingredients certified from the supplier as free from such substances can be assured.<br>
Then, by virtue of the fact that the absence of any chemical substances in a given sample is not scientifically demonstrable, but one can simply determine that the quantity possibly existing is lower than the detection limit of the analytical method used (even if the more sensitive and refined method known in the art<br>
was used), also the use of an enzymatic pre-treatment<br>
results to be a source of an additional guarantee.<br>
By mere way of example, some anallergic formulations<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-19-<br>
of medium for the growth of probiotic bacterial cultures are reported below.<br>
The components of a culture medium must bring nitrogen<br>
sources (in this case the peptones and/or proteinic<br>
hydrolyzates), carbon sources (in this case, the glucose and/or other mono- or disaccharides derived from hydrolysis of complex polysaccharides), growth bioac-tivators and vitamins (in this case from yeast extract) and mineral salts. For example, a culture medium can contain:<br>
-	glucose preferably selected from: maize starch, po<br>
tato, beet sucrose or cane sucrose;<br>
-	peptone preferably selected from:  rice,  potato,<br>
maize, chestnut, tapioca, manioca, pea, broad beans,<br>
bean or generally legumes and their mixtures;<br>
-	peptone preferably selected from: meat;<br>
-	yeast extract; mineral salts (such as, by mere way<br>
of example: acetates, carbonates, phosphates, hydrogen<br>
*<br>
phosphates, chlorides, citrates, sulfates and others) ; builder (if necessary, such as: Tween, lecithins and other) and drinking water.<br>
One of the formulation suitable for the growth of strains of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera could preferably include the following ingredients:<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-20-<br>
glucose (from the sources above listed) 10-100 g/1<br>
rice peptone 10-50 g/1<br>
meat peptone 10-50 g/1<br>
yeast extract 2-20 g/1<br>
mineral salts 1-10 g/1<br>
builders	0-5 ml/i<br>
drinking water     q.s. to the desired volume .<br>
A preferred example of a medium for anallergic probi-<br>
otic bacterial cultures could be the following:<br>

terials subject of the present invention.<br>
For example, in case of milk-derived allergens, the<br>
research by analytical way of p-lactoglobulin and lac-<br>
tose on the end products, with confirmed specific and<br>
sensitive methodologies (analysis with ELISA kit specific for the p-lactoglobulin of the type "Bovine P-lactoglubilins ELISA quantitation kit - Bethyl Laboratories", with a threshold limit of 0.05 ppm and analysis with chemoenzymatic kit and UV-vis detection for the lactose of the type "Lactose/D-glucose - Boe-hringer Mannheim, cod. 10986119, with a threshold limit of 7 ppm) gives a negative result and, therefore, these substances, if any, should certainly be under the detection threshold.<br>
At the same time, the gluten research carried out with the more refined and, so far, more sensitive confirmed methodology (ELISA RIDASCREEN® Gliadin kit -R-Biopharm A, Darmstadt, Germany, with a sensitivity equal to 3 ppm) allows to confirm the absence of gluten. It follows that, even if the gluten were present, its concentration should be in any case under the detection threshold, namely lower than 3 ppm.<br>
The enzymatic pre-treatment on the raw materials, to be carried out or not as a function of the requirements, is able to hydrolize milk and derivatives<br><br>

-22-<br>
traces and gluten and derivatives accidentally existing in the culture medium.<br>
Such treatment imparts the highest safety standard for<br>
a use also suitable to allergic and particularly sensitive persons.<br>
This manufacturing strategy is suitable for the probi-otics production with an anallergic safety degree called DSS - Double Safety System.<br>
The enzymatic pre-treatment foresees the use of at least a proteolytic enzyme and/or the use of at least a glycosidase enzyme.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the proteolytic enzyme is able to perform a proteolysis. The proteolytic enzyme is selected from the group including the proteases and/or the peptidases. The proteases and the peptidases are selected from the group including: trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, pepsin, papain and bromelain. Preferably, the proteases and the peptidases are selected between pepsin and/or bromelain. In the context of the present invention, the glycosidase enzyme is able to perform a hydrolityc cleavage of a glycoside. The glycosidase enzyme is selected from the group including: alfa-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase, alfa-galactosidase and beta-galactosi-dase.<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-23-<br>
Advantageously, the enzymatic treatment of the raw materials forming the growth broth for the probiotics is carried out with proteases (alcalases and bromelain) and with the glycosidases.<br>
The glycosidases are selected from the group including: lactase (or p-galactosidase). In a preferred embodiment, the pre-treatment of the raw materials foresees the use in a sequence including three enzymes: alcalase, lactase and bromelain. In a preferred embodiment, the selection of the en-<br>
•<br><br>
zymes and their sequence is the following:<br>
-	alcalase, which practically hydrolyzes all the pro<br>
teins and particularly those of the milk;<br>
-	lactase, which hydrolyzes the lactose;<br>
-	bromelain, which hydrolyzes the gluten.<br>
The sequence shown is a function of the optimal hydrolysis pH in a gradient from basic to acid; in this way, the medium preserves the nutritional properties. The alcalase, active towards the {B-lactoglobulin, the cc-lactaalbumin and the caseins, allows to eliminate allergenic residuals, if any, deriving from fortuitous and unintentional cross-contaminations with milk derivatives.<br>
Such treatment foresees the addition to the raw materials dissolved in water of a quantity of- enzyme vary-<br><br>
WO 2007/054989	PCT/IT2006/000574<br>
-24-<br>
ing from 0.0025 and 0.0500 g/1, corresponding to 0.001-0.020 AD/1 (Anson Units per Liter). The solution is then brought to a temperature between 45 and 55°C for 15-60'minutes, with a pH between 7 and 8; preferably, a controlled pH of 7.50±0.20. The lactase, also known as p-galactosidase, is charged to the hydrolysis of the glycoside bond between glucose and galactose in the lactose disaccharide. The treatment with lactase as carried out following to the hydrolysis with proteins alcalase after having brought the pH of the culture broth to a value between 6 and 7; preferably, a value of 6.50 ± 0.20 with organic acids (preferably lactic acid) by adding 250-2.000 NLU/1 (Neutral.Lactase Units per Liter), corresponding to 0.05 - 0.40 ml of an enzyme solution titrated at 5.000 NLU/g.<br>
The solution is maintained at 37 ± 5°C for a varying period of 2-6 hours. Finally, the bromelain is a pro-teolytic enzyme naturally contained in the pineapple, capable of effectively hydrolysing the gliadin in fragments not recognized by the immune system and therefore non allergenic.<br>
The treatment is carried out by adding the fermentation medium with the enzyme to the amount of 0.005-0.010 g/1 (equal to 110 - 220 GDU/1, Gelatin Digesting<br><br>

Units per Liter), after correction of the pH to values of 5.0-6.0 with organic acids (preferably lactic acid). The working temperature must be maintained at<br>
^<br>
37±5°C for a time between 1 and 6 hours. Following to the three enzymatic treatments, it is necessary to restore the pH at the optimal value for •the fermentation of ,the single strains (preferably with 5N NaOH in order to basify, or with acid lactic in order to acidify).<br>
Next, a heat treatment for the purification of the medium is carried out (performed at temperatures between 90 and 145°C for times varying from few seconds to 45 minutes), which will however denature and inactivate the added enzymes, without further risks for the end product and their intended people deriving from residuals of the enzyme used.<br>
A typical industrial production design therefore foresees the following steps:<br>
a.	selection of the anallergic raw materials<br>
b.	dissolution of the raw materials in water<br>
c.	correction of the pH and temperature to proper val<br>
ues for the use of the proteolytic enzyme, preferably<br>
alcalase<br><br>
d.	addition of the enzyme and its action for the re<br>
quired time<br><br>

g.	correction of the pH and the temperature to proper<br>

h. addition of the enzyme and its action for the required time<br>
i. correction of the pH up to values suitable for the fermentation<br>
j. purification through  pasteurisation and/or sterilization of the culture medium.<br>
k. cooling at the inoculum temperature typical of the probiotic strain under production (37 ± 2°C). 1. inoculum of the strain m. fermentation<br>
n. separation of the biomass and crioprotection o. freeze drying.<br>
The present invention allows then to produce analler-gic probiotic strains and in particular with absolute •absence of. allergens, more preferably of milk and gluten derivatives, with a wide safety of use for all the populations classes.<br><br>

Advantageously,  the  anallergic probiotic bacterial<br>
cultures prepared according . to the teachings of the<br>
i<br>
present invention can be effectively used for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations. In view of the high number of persons allergic to the milk (3-5% of the population with an age below 2 years) and the. celiac persons (1% of the total population) it is useful to try to develop probiotic bacteria which can be administered also to this classes of population. The present invention is then useful:<br>
•	to the consumers, for which the transparency in the<br>
labelling is fundamental;<br>
»<br>
•	to the producers, which in this way can rely on a<br>
product with a total guarantee of'its anallergic prop<br>
erties, therefore proposable to the whole purchasing<br>
population.</td>
