BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Relationship to Prior Applications<br>
This application is a continuation in part of USSN 08/823,592, filed 3/25/97, now<br>
abandoned, which is a continuation of USSN 08/489,541 filed 6/12/95, abandoned, which is a<br>
continuation in part of USSN 08/200,137, filed on 2/22/94, abandoned.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method of producing a catalyst useful in the<br>
reaction of ethylene, oxygen and acetic acid in the vapor phase to form vinyl acetate. In<br>
particular, the present invention is directed to a novel method of forming a catalyst useful in the<br>
catalytic formation of vinyl acetate in which said catalyst comprises metallic palladium and gold<br>
deposited on a suitable porous support.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
It is known in the art that vinyl acetate can be produced by reacting ethylene, oxygen,<br>
and acetic acid in the gaseous phase and in the presence of a catalyst comprising palladium, goid<br>
and an alkali metal acetate supported on certain carrier materials such as silica. Generally, such<br>
catalyst system exhibits a high activity. Unfortunately, results utilizing such palladium and gold<br>
catalysts have been inconsistent. This inconsistency appears to be based somewhat on the<br>
distribution pattern or profile of the catalyst components which are deposited on and in relation<br>
to the support. For example, when use is made of the known vinyl acetate catalyst systems<br>
comprising a porous support with palladium and gold, the metal components deposited at or<br>
about the support interiors or central regions do not contribute significantly to the reaction<br>
mechanism, since the reactants are not readily able to diffuse into the central or inner regions of<br>
the porous network of the catalyst. Hence, the reaction occurs substantially only at the<br>
outermost or surface regions of the catalyst. The catalyst components in the interior regions of<br>
the support do not largely contribute to the reaction scheme, resulting in a reduction in catalytic<br>
efficiency per unit weight of the catalyst components. Furthermore, the use of a highly active<br>
catalyst at times gives rise to side reactions and, therefore, leads to a reduced selectivity to vinyl<br>
acetate.<br>
Various patents have been granted based on the desire to more evenly distribute and<br>
anchor the gold and palladium catalytic components within a narrow band on the support surface<br>
to provide a vinyl acetate catalyst having high yield, good selectivity and long life. Examples of<br>
such patents include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,274,181; 4,087,622; 4,048,096; 3,822,308; 3,775,342<br>
and British Patent 1,521,652. Certain U. S. patents assigned to Hoechst Celanese Corporation,<br>
U. S. Nos. 5,314,858 and 5,332,710 and their PCT and foreign counterparts disclose and claim<br>
improvements in the basic technology.<br>
The basic method of forming the vinyl acetate catalyst containing palladium and gold<br>
deposited on a catalyst support comprises (1) impregnating the support with aqueous solutions of<br>
water-soluble palladium and gold compounds, (2) precipitating water-insoluble palladium and<br>
gold compounds on the catalyst support by contacting the impregnated catalyst support with a<br>
solution of compounds capable of reacting with the water-soluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds to form the insoluble precious metal compounds (3) washing the treated catalyst<br>
with water to remove anions which are freed from the initially impregnated palladium and gold<br>
compounds during precipitation and (4) converting the water-insoluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds to the free metal by treatment with a reducing agent. A final treatment usually<br>
involves (5) impregnating the reduced catalyst with an aqueous alkali metal acetate solution and<br>
(6) drying the final catalyst product.<br>
Prior art attempts to provide a uniform distribution of the palladium and gold metals on<br>
the support has involved some manipulation of the above mentioned steps and/or by using<br>
support materials having various specified pore dimensions.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,314,858. pertains to a method for (1) simultaneously or<br>
successively impregnating a catalyst support with aqueous solutions of palladium and gold salts<br>
such as sodium-palladium chloride and auric chloride, (2) fixing the precious metals on the<br>
support by precipitating water-insoluble palladium and gold compounds by treatment of the<br>
impregnated supports with a reactive basic solution such as aqueous sodium hydroxide which<br>
reacts to form hydroxides of palladium and gold on the support surface, (3) washing with water<br>
to remove the chloride ion (or other anion), and (4) reducing the precious metal hydroxides to<br>
free palladium and gold, wherein the improvement comprises during fixing step (2) utilizing two<br>
separate precipitation steps wherein the amounts of the reactive compound in contact with the<br>
salt-impregnated support in each step is no more than that required to react with the water<br>
soluble precious metal compounds impregnated in the support. Between the separate fixing or<br>
precipitation steps, the support which has been impregnated with the reactive basic solution is<br>
allowed to stand for a set period of time to allow precipitation of the water insoluble precious<br>
metal compounds before the second fixing step in which additional reactive basic compound is<br>
added to the support.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing a vinyl acetate<br>
catalyst which contains palladium and gold on a porous support in which the fixing of the water<br>
soluble precious metal compounds as water insoluble compounds on the support can be achieved<br>
by contacting the impregnated support with sufficient reactive compound to insure complete<br>
precipitation and fixing of the precious metal compounds onto the support in multiple fixing<br>
steps.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that particularly active supported catalysts containing palladium<br>
and gold useful for the production of vinyl esters from ethylene, lower carboxylic acids with 2-4<br>
carbon atoms and oxygen in the gas phase at elevated temperature and at normal or elevated<br>
pressure can be obtained by modifying steps (1) and (2) of the process as described above.<br>
Typically, during the precipitation step (2), the impregnated catalyst support has been<br>
impregnated with one or more solutions of the reactive compound and the oxide (hydroxide) of<br>
both is caused to precipitate simultaneously for such time as is necessary to complete<br>
precipitation of the insoluble precious metal compounds. During a typical precipitation<br>
according to the prior art we have noticed that the palladium precipitates at a faster rate than<br>
gold precipitates and incremental amounts of unprecipitated gold can leach from the catalyst<br>
support prior to its being immobilized by precipitation or in a subsequent washing step. This is a<br>
cause for the palladium to gold ratio to vary from impregnation to precipitation. Although the<br>
problem exists with precipitant solutions equal to the pore volume of the support, an even more<br>
serious problem exists when precipitation is carried out by immersing the impregnated supports<br>
in dilute precipitants.<br>
To overcome this problem and in accordance with the present invention, a useful<br>
catalyst is formed by (1) non-successivcly impregnating a catalyst support with aqutous<br>
solutions of palladium and gold salts such as sodium-palladium chloride and auric chloride, (2)<br>
non-successively fixing each of the precious metals on the support by precipitating water-<br>
insoluble palladium and gold compounds by treatment of the impregnated supports with a<br>
reactive basic solution such as aqueous sodium hydroxide which reacts to form hydroxides of<br>
palladium and gold on the support surface, (3) washing with water to remove the chloride ion (or<br>
other anion), and (4) reducing the precious metal hydroxides to free palladium and gold.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the preparation of the improved catalyst of the present invention, a suitable catalyst<br>
support is first impregnated with an aqueous solution containing either a water-soluble palladium<br>
compound or a water soluble gold compound. Palladium (II) chloride, sodium palladium (II)<br>
chloride and palladium (II) nitrate are examples of suitable water-soluble palladium compounds,<br>
whereas auric (III) chloride or tetrachloroauric (III) acid and the alkali metal salts thereof can be<br>
used as the water-soluble gold compounds. The generally available tetrachloroauric (III) acid<br>
and the sodium palladium (II) chloride are preferred because of their high water solubility.<br>
Typically, the quantity of these compounds employed is such as to provide 1 to 10 grams of<br>
palladium and 0.5 to 5 grams of gold per liter of finished catalyst. Accordingly, the amount of<br>
gold present in the catalyst will be from about 10 to about 70% of the amount of palladium.<br>
Preparation of catalyst for the manufacture of vinyl acetate from ethylene, oxygen, and acetic<br>
acid according to the method of this invention can provide a catalyst with at least 17 wt% more<br>
palladium and at least 12 wt% more gold than by the use of the method of U. S. Patent No.<br>
5,332,701. The method of this invention can provide a catalyst with at least an equivalent<br>
amount or greater of gold than by the use of U.S. Patent No. 5,314,858—<br>
Comparative examples were performed on catalysts prepared by the method of this<br>
invention (separate fix technique) as described herein and the double fix technique prepared in<br>
accordance with US 5,314,858. Table 2 illustrates the results of these examples. It can be seen<br>
that the method of this invention provided greater gold retention than the method of US "858.<br>
The volume of solution used for impregnating the support with the precious metals is<br>
important. For effective deposition, the volume of the impregnating solution should be from 95<br>
to 100% of the absorptive capacity of the catalyst support and preferably it should be 98-99%.<br>
The support material for the catalyst according to the present invention can be of any<br>
diverse geometrical shape. For example, the support can be shaped as spheres, tablets or<br>
cylinders. The geometrical dimensions of the support material can, in general, be in the range of<br>
1-8 mm. A most suitable geometrical shape is, in particular, the spherical shape, for example,<br>
spheres with diameters in the range of 4-8 mm. These supports are generally called pills.<br>
The specific surface area of the support material can vary within wide limits. For<br>
example, support materials which have an inner surface area of 50-300 m2/g and especially 100-<br>
200 m2/g (measured according to BET) are suitable.<br>
Examples of support materials which can be used include silica, aluminum oxide,<br>
aluminum silicates or spinels. Silica is the preferred support material.<br>
After each impregnation of the support with the water soluble palladium or gold<br>
compound, the impregnated support may be dried prior to fixing the palladium or gold<br>
compound as a water insoluble compound on the support. The fixing solution is one which<br>
comprises an alkaline solution, for example, an aqueous solution which contains alkali metal<br>
hydroxides, alkali metal bicarbonates and/or alkali metal carbonates. It is particularly preferred<br>
to use aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. By treatment with the<br>
alkaline solution, the precious metal salts are converted to water insoluble compounds believed<br>
to be hydroxides and/or oxides, at least in the case where the alkaline solution is a solution of<br>
sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
According to the prior art, the alkaline fixing solution was dispersed onto the<br>
impregnated supports and the treated supports were allowed to stand for up to 24 hours or more<br>
during the precipitation. The volume of fixing solution was that equal to the dry absorptivity of<br>
the support and the amount of alkaline compound used was in excess on a molar basis of that<br>
required to react with all of the impregnated precious metal salts.<br>
For the method of the present invention, in each fixing step, the amount of the alkaline<br>
compound contained in the fixing solution should be such that the ratio of alkali metal to anion<br>
from the water soluble precious metal salt be from about 1:1 to about 1.8:1 molar.<br>
The volume of solution in each fixing step can be equivalent to the pore volume of the<br>
support or the impregnated support can be fully immersed in the fixing solution wherein the total<br>
volume of solution is sufficient to cover the volume of the support. Alternatively, the support<br>
can be impregnated in one or both of the separate fixing steps by a process designated "rotation<br>
immersion" which is set forth in commonly assigned application U. S. Patent No. 5,332,710, In<br>
this process, the impregnated catalyst support is immersed in the alkaline fixing solution and<br>
tumbled or rotated therein at least during the initial steps of the precipitation of the water<br>
insoluble precious metal compounds. The rotation or tumbling of the supports in the alkaline<br>
fixing solution should proceed for at least 0.5 hour upon the initial treatment and, preferably, for<br>
at least 2.5 hour. The rotation immersion treatment can last as long as up to 4 hours and the<br>
treated supports may be allowed to stand in the fixing solution to insure that complete<br>
precipitation of the water soluble precious metal compounds takes place.<br>
Any type of rotation or tumbling equipment can be used as the exact apparatus utilized<br>
is not critical. What may be critical, however, is the extent of the rotating motion. Thus, the<br>
rotation should be sufficient so that all surfaces of the impregnated supports are evenly contacted<br>
with the alkaline fixing solution. The rotation should not be so harsh that actual abrasion of the<br>
insoluble precious metal compounds takes place such that the insoluble compounds are abraded<br>
off the support surface. Generally, the extent of rotation should be about 1 to 50 rpm and<br>
possibly even higher depending upon the exact support utilized and the amount of precious metal<br>
to be deposited on the support. The rpm to be used is variable and may also depend upon the<br>
apparatus utilized, the size and shape of the support, the type of support, metal loadings, etc., but<br>
should fall within the guidelines expressed above that while a small amount of abrasion may<br>
take place, it is not to be such that the insoluble compounds are actually abraded off the support<br>
surface to an unacceptable degree.<br>
Prior to each fixing step the impregnated catalyst support may be dried to remove<br>
absorbed water. If fixing is carried out by the pore volume method, drying of the impregnated<br>
support is required to obtain full contact of the precious metal with the fixing solution to cause<br>
precipitation. Preferably for the rotation immersion method the impregnated support is not dried<br>
prior to fixing.<br>
Alternatively the impregnating solution containing the gold compound and the fixing<br>
solution can be mixed immediately prior to impregnation thus avoiding a separate fixing step.<br>
This is possible because the insoluble gold salt is quite slow to form at ambient room<br>
temperature.<br>
Subsequent to the fixing, the supports are washed such as with distilled water so as to<br>
remove the anions, such as the chlorides, which are still contained on the support and freed from<br>
the initial impregnating solution. Washing is continued until all of the anions are removed from<br>
the support. Ideally no more than about 1,000 ppm of anion should remain on the catalyst. To<br>
ensure substantially complete removal of the anions such as chloride ion from the catalyst, the<br>
wash effluent can be tested with silver nitrate. The catalyst is then dried at temperatures not to<br>
exceed about 150°C.<br>
The fixed and washed material is then treated with a reducing agent in order to convert<br>
the precious metal salts and compounds which are present into the metallic form. The reduction<br>
can be carried out in the liquid phase, for example, with aqueous hydrazine hydrate, or in the gas<br>
phase, for example, with hydrogen or hydrocarbons, for example, ethylene. If the reduction is<br>
carried out with a solution of hydrazine hydrate, the reaction is preferably carried out at normal<br>
temperature. When the reduction is carried out in the gas phase, it can be advantageous to carry<br>
out the reaction at elevated temperature, for example, at 100-200°C in the case of reduction with<br>
ethylene. The reducing agent is appropriately employed in excess so that it is certain that all of<br>
the precious metal salts and compounds are converted into the metallic form.<br>
Depending on the use for which the catalyst prepared in this way is intended, the latter<br>
can also be provided with customary additives. Thus, for example, additions of alkali metal<br>
acetates are advantageous when the catalyst is to be used for the preparation of unsaturated esters<br>
from olefins, oxygen and organic acids. In this case, for example, the catalyst can, for this<br>
purpose, be impregnated with an aqueous solution of potassium acetate and then dried.<br>
The catalysts according to the invention can be used with particular advantage in the<br>
preparation of vinyl acetate from ethylene, oxygen and acetic acid in the gas phase. For this<br>
purpose, those catalysts according to the invention which contain silica as the support material<br>
and additives of alkali metal acetates are particularly suitable. In the above mentioned<br>
preparation of vinyl acetate, such catalyst are also distinguished by high activity and selectivity<br>
and by long life.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-4<br>
The catalysts of Examples 1-4 were prepared in accordance with the method of the<br>
present invention. The specific examples are described in Table 1. For each example, silica<br>
catalyst supports provided by Sud Chemie having a spherical shape and a diameter of about<br>
7.3 mm were utilized unless otherwise specified. In all the examples, 250 cc. of the supports<br>
were impregnated with an aqueous solution containing sufficient sodium palladium chloride to<br>
provide 1.65 g (6.6 g/1) palladium on the support. In Table 1 the term "incipient wetness" is<br>
known in the art to mean a volume of solution equal to the pore volume of the support. The<br>
treated supports were then fixed with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide according to the<br>
method described in Table 1. The amount of sodium hydroxide used in the first fixing step as<br>
defined as the molar ratio of sodium cation to chloride anion is 1.2:1. Variations in the fixing<br>
times are also set forth in Table 1. After the first fixing, the treated material was thoroughly<br>
washed with distilled water to remove the chloride ions. The water flow rate was about 200<br>
cc/min for approximately 5 hours except where otherwise noted. After washing the catalysts<br>
were air dried for one hour at 100°C. The dried catalysts were then impregnated with 0.75g<br>
(3.0 g/1) gold used as an aqueous solution of sodium chloroaurate. The treated supports were<br>
then fixed with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide according to the method described in<br>
Table 1. The amount of sodium hydroxide used in the second fixing step as defined as the molar<br>
ratio of sodium to chloride anion is 1.2:1. Variations in the fixing times are also set forth in<br>
Table 1. After the second fixing, the base treated material was thoroughly washed with distilled<br>
water to remove the chloride ions. The water flow rate was about 200 cc/min for approximately<br>
5 hours unless otherwise noted. After washing the catalysts were air dried in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at 150°C. Each prepared catalyst was then reduced with ethylene gas at a<br>
temperature of 150°C. The reducing gas contained 5% ethylene in nitrogen and was passed over<br>
the catalysts for 5 hours at atmospheric pressure. The reduced catalyst was impregnated with an<br>
aqueous solution containing 10 grams (40 g/1) of potassium acetate at a solution volume equal to<br>
the support absorptivity. The catalysts were dried at a temperature no greater than 150°C.<br>
The catalysts of examples 4-6 were prepared in accordance with the method described<br>
in US 5,314,858. The catalysts of example 7-11 were prepared in accordance with the method of<br>
the present invention. Initial and final metal loadings are identified in Table 2. It can be seen<br>
that the average metal retention for Pd under the technique of US "858 was 88%, and for Au was<br>
77%, while the average metal retention for Pd under the inventive technique was 88%, and for<br>
Au was 85%. The catalysts of Examples 1-11 were utilized to prepare vinyl acetate by the<br>
reaction of ethylene, oxygen and acetic acid according to methods well known in the art.<br>
