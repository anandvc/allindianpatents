Description<br>
Double-disc seal for top rollers of drafting assemblies<br>
The invention relates to a double-disc seal for top rollers on drafting assemblies   <br>
                                                                    wherein one respective roller body is<br>
rotatabiy mounted on the ends of an axle, said double-disc seal comprises: sealing discs which are formed and arranged in such a way that, for sealing, they form a narrow, slip-free sealing gap against the roller body and are axially supported by at least partially disc-shaped supporting elements; a supporting element which is constructed as an angle ring and can be pushed with its sleeve-shaped part onto the axle; and a spring element, by means of which the two sealing discs can be pressed apart and against the supporting elements, characterised in that the supporting elements are constructed in such a way that a further sealing gap is situated in front of the sealing gaps between the sealing discs and roller body.<br>
In top or press roller twins on spinning machines-drafting assemblies, the interior of the roller housing, which conventionally comprises a roller bearing assembly, is generally sealed against fibre fly from the ambient air, as is known, for example, from DE 40 39 804 Al or DE 195 09 055 CI. The seals shown there consist of a one-piece U-shaped sleeve with flanges on either side. They obtain their sealing effect, on the one hand, from the two sealing gaps formed by the flanges towards the outer ring h ole and, on the other hand, by means of the cavity between the two flanges, in which the fibres and particles of dirt which have penetrated through the outer sealing gap can collect and are prevented from further penetration into the roller bearing by the inner sealing gap. Seals of this type are simple and economical to produce and assemble. Assembly can be carried out using automated assembly devices.<br>
For reasons related to punching, one of the two flanges must be cut slightly smaller in diameter than the other. This leads to different sealing gap widths. Owing to the tolerances during production of the diameters and the possibility of radial deviations between the hole and flange, an increased factor of safety is conventionally taken into account in the sealing gap in order to reliably avoid touching or grazing of the   flanges in the hole of the roller housing and therefore to<br><br><br>
ensure a slip-free seal. In an environment particularly encumbered by fibre fly and dust, it may occasionally occur that the sealing effect is impaired by a relatively large sealing gap and so much dirt collects in the cavity formed by the flanges of the sleeve that the roller housing is slightly impeded in its rotation or is even unacceptably braked.<br>
The generic DE-AS 15 10 922 describes seals with sealing discs resiliently loaded with pressure in the axial direction, with an outwardly centred sealing disc with a large inner gap following an inwardly centred supporting disc. The radially movable sealing discs are fixed by the axially applied pressure. An extremely small sealing gap can be produced in this manner between the sealing discs and roller housing.<br>
Seals of this type, however, consist of a number of parts. For automatic assembly, a complex assembly device is required, the susceptibility to faults of the automatic assembly being increased. This leads to considerably higher costs than in the use of the above-mentioned U-shaped one-piece sleeves. The sealing discs are axially supported only with the slight force of the tension spring and can easily be moved in the axial direction toward the interior of the seal. This occurs with a disadvantageous effect particularly when there is a lap formation on the axle. The pressure from built-up fibres can become so great here that the sealing function of the sealing discs arranged outwardly toward the ambient air is lastingly interrupted. The sealing disc can be pressed from the centred position, and there may be deceleration of the top roller owing to canting of the sealing disc. There may also be functional impairments owing to the fibre fly collecting on the sealing disc. The embodiments of the seals prone to these<br><br><br>
defects shown in DE-AS 15 10 922 have not been able to prove themselves in practice and have therefore not gained acceptance either. The object of the invention is to provide an improved double-disc seal for top rollers. Double-disc seal for top rollers of drafting assemblies, wherein one respective roller body is rotatably mounted on the ends of an axle, said double-disc seal comprises: sealing discs which are formed and arranged in such a way that, for sealing, they form a narrow, slip-free sealing gap against the roller body and are axially supported by at least partially disc-shaped supporting elements; a supporting element which is constructed as an angle ring and can be pushed with its sleeve-shaped part onto the axle; and a spring element, by means of which the two sealing discs can be pressed apart and against the supporting elements, characterised in that the supporting elements are constructed in such a way that a further sealing gap is situated in front of the sealing gaps between the sealing discs and roller body. Double-disc seal wherein the further sealing gap is formed between the supporting element and the roller body. Double-disc seal, wherein the difference between the respective greatest diameter of the supporting elements and the greatest diameter of the sealing discs is less than 0.5 mm. Double-disc seal, wherein the difference between the respective greatest diameter of the supporting elements and the greatest diameter of the sealing discs is less than 0.2 mm. Double-disc seal, wherein the spring element is a helical spring. Double-disc seal, wherein the double-disc seal comprises two supporting elements, which are both constructed as angle rings and, with their sleeve-shaped part are pushed toward one another mirror-symmetrically on to the axle in such a way that their disc-shaped part lies outwardly in each case and the two sealing discs are arranged between the disc-shaped parts. Double-disc seal, wherein the sleeve-shaped parts of the supporting elements are pressed into a connecting sleeve and, together with the two sealing discs and at least one spring element., form a preassembled subassembly. Double-disc seal, wherein the spring element is formed by spring arms of the connecting sleeve and the connecting sleeve is made up of resilient plastics material. Double-disc seal, wherein the angle rings are formed without cutting from sheet metal.<br>
In the double-disc seal according to the invention with a further sealing gap situated in front of the outer sealing gap there are no functional disruptions in the case of lap formation owing to axial forces which act from outside on the sealing disc. The double-disc seal can be automatically assembled in a simple manner. Both the production and the assembly of the double-disc seal can therefore be carried out economically. Specific side orientation of the double-disc seal is not necessary during assembly. Constructionally identical double-disc seals can be used at the two ends of the axle. Production and storage of different designs is therefore not necessary in the case of the case of the double-disc seal according to the invention.<br>
Supporting elements only have to be produced, in each case, in a single design. This reduces the number of different parts required and to be produced for the double-disc seal according to the invention.<br><br><br>
Assembly in which the double-disc seal is initially pushed, as a preassembled subassembly, so far onto the axle that the roller body can be tilted on the axle for feeding in roller elements of a roller bearing assembly and, following the completion of the roller bearing assembly, the subassembly is pressed back into the operating position, allows both the sealing discs and the supporting elements to form a narrow sealing gap without difficulties occurring during assembly. Both the preassembly to form the subassembly and also the assembly on the axle can be automated and therefore carried out quickly and economically.<br>
Further details of the invention can be inferred from the embodiments described with the aid of the figures, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows, partially in section, a top roller twin, the roller bodies of which each have a double-disc seal according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows, in an enlarged sectional view, detail Y of Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 shows, in an enlarged sectional view, detail Z of Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 4 shows, in an enlarged sectional view, an embodiment of the double-disc seal with two supporting elements formed as an angle ring.<br>
The top roller twin 1 shown in Fig. 1 has two roller bodies 2,<br>
3,	which are mounted by means of roller bearing arrangements<br>
4,	5 on a common penetrating axle 6. A saddle 8 is formed on<br><br><br>
the axle 6, on which the axle 6 is held by a	conventional<br>
holder. The interior of each roller body 2,	3 is sealed<br>
against soiling by a respective double-disc	seal 7, 7A<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an enlarged view of the double-disc seal 7 acting between the roller body 2 and the axle 6. The supporting element for the sealing disc 9 is formed as an angle ring 10, the disc-shaped part 11 serving as a stop for the sealing disc 9. The sleeve-shaped part 12 of the angle ring 10 has a stop face 13, against which a supporting element designed as a disc<br>
14	is placed and is fixed by caulking. The disc 14 forms the stop for the sealing disc 15. The sealing disc 9 and sealing disc 15 are constructionally identical. The sealing discs 9,<br>
15	are loaded in the axial direction by pressure force by means of a helical spring 16. In the process, the sealing disc<br>
9	is pressed against the disc-shaped part 11 of the angle ring<br>
10	and the sealing disc 15 is pressed against the disc 14. The<br>
spring force fixes the sealing discs 9, 15 in the required<br>
centred operating position, but at all times allows a slight<br>
re-centring. The helical spring 16 is made of round wire, the<br>
wire diameter and number of windings of the helical spring 16<br>
being selected such that the helical spring 16 can be<br>
pretensioned such that the length thereof is slightly shorter<br>
than the spacing between the two pressed on sealing discs 9,<br>
15. The internal diameter of the helical spring 16 is selected<br>
such that it only has slight radial clearance from the sleeve-<br>
shaped parts 12 of the angle ring 10. In this manner, the<br>
spring windings form a virtually gapless surface, whereby<br>
assembly is facilitated. The sealing discs 9, 15 form a very<br>
narrow sealing gap 17, 18, in each case, with the rolling body<br>
2. The external diameter of the disc 14 and the external<br><br><br>
diameter of the disc-shaped part 11 of the angle ring 10 is only slightly smaller than the external diameter of the sealing discs 9, 15. The sealing body 2, for example, has an internal diameter of 16.18 mm, while the external diameter of the sealing disc 9, 15 is 16.15 mm in each case and the external diameter of the disc 14 and the disc-shaped part 11 are 15.97 mm in each case. The further sealing gap 19, 20 between the disc 14 and the disc-shaped part 11 is therefore narrow and prevents the sealing function of the double-disc seal 7 being lastingly disrupted in the case of lap formation on the axle 6. At the internal diameter, the angle ring 10 on each end has a bevel 21, 22. The bevel 22 is substantially formed during caulking of the disc 14. The bevels 21, 22 facilitate centring of the double disc seal 7 when pressed onto the axle 6.<br>
To assemble the double-disc seal 7, one after the other, the sealing disc 9, the helical spring 16 and the sealing disc 15 are pushed onto the sleeve-shaped part 12 of the angle ring 10 and the disc 15 is then joined to the stop face 13 and fixed by caulking. The subassembly thus produced is pressed onto the axle 6 and pushed in the direction of the saddle 8 to such an extent that the roller body 2 can be tilted in the end region of the axle 6 to feed in the balls of the roller bearing assembly 4.<br>
After assembly of the roller bearing assembly 4 the double-disc seal 7 formed as a subassembly is pressed back in the direction of the end of the axle 6 or in the direction of the roller body 2 until it has reached the operating position and can fulfil its sealing function. All the assembly steps can be carried out in an automated assembly method.<br><br><br>
The double-disc seal 7 is designed such that the subassembly can be assembled in an undirected manner on the two ends of the axle 6, in other words without a specific orientation. The double-disc seal 7 and the double disc seal 7A are constructionally identical, as Figs. 2 and 3 show. While the double-disc seal 7 is mounted on the end part of the axle 6, which is on the left-hand side in Fig. 1, the constructionally identical double-disc seal 7A is mounted on the right-hand end part of the axle 6 in the roller body 3. The sealing function and the advantages of the constructionally identical design according to the invention can be fully exploited in the two positions.<br>
An alternative embodiment is shown by Fig. 4 with the double-disc seal 23. In order to form a preassembled subassembly, a sealing disc 25 is pushed onto the sleeve-shaped part of an angle ring 24. Two angle rings 24 equipped in this manner are mirror-symmetrically pressed into a connecting sleeve 26 made of resilient plastics material in such a way that their sleeve-shaped parts are held abutting one another in the connecting sleeve 26. The connecting sleeve 26 has spring arms 27 at both ends. The connecting sleeve 26 can be economically produced in one piece together with the spring arms 27 in an injection moulding die and thus reduces the number of individual parts required and the outlay for assembly. The double-disc seal 23 preassembled as a subassembly is formed axially symmetrically.<br>
The sealing discs 25 are each pressed in the axial direction against the disc-shaped part of the angle rings 24 acting as a stop by the spring force of the spring arms 27 and are fixed<br><br><br>
there so as to be displaceable. This double-disc seal 23 assembled as a subassembly can also be assembled in an undirected manner on the axle 6 like the double-disc seals 7, 7A of Figs. 1 to 3. The two angle rings 24 are formed such that they form narrow further sealing gaps 19, 20 in cooperation with the sealing bodies 2, 3.<br>
The assembly of the double-disc seal 23 and the roller bearing assemblies 4, 5 takes place in the same manner as in the case of the double-disc seal 7, 7A. The angle ring 24 may be economically produced without cutting from sheet metal. Only angle rings 24, sealing discs 25 and a connecting sleeve 26 and therefore only three different parts need to be produced and stored for assembly of the double-disc seal 23. This leads to a notable cost saving.<br>
Owing to the U-shaped formation of the subassembly of the double-disc seal 23, it can be automatically assembled on the axle 6 with the same assembly apparatuses as the one-piece, U-shaped sleeve seals known from DE 195 09 055 CI.<br>
The invention is not limited to the described embodiments. Further embodiments in the scope of the invention are possible, in particular with regard to the formation of the angle ring and the spring element.<br><br><br>
