Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid aeration system.<br>
Background<br>
In the prior art, it is often needed to have liquid aerated.<br>
For example, in the biological treatment of waste water (such as industrial waste<br>
water or household sewage), waste water often needs to be aerated, so as to provide with<br>
oxygen to the aerobic micro-organisms in the waste water. The micro-organisms are able to<br>
absorb, adsorb and oxidize the organic contaminants carried in the waste water, and<br>
decompose them to some simple inorganic materials such as oxidized carbon, water, sulfate,<br>
nitrate etc., that is, turn the toxic and harmful matters into non-toxic and harmless matters,<br>
so that the waste water is purified.<br>
In aquaculture, if the content of oxygen dissolved in water is lower than 4 mg/L,<br>
fishes would hardly keep living, thus, it is necessary to add oxygen into the water providing<br>
with the essential oxygen for fishes' living. Less oxygen dissolved in the water indicates<br>
higher water pollution, and so it is more necessary to supply oxygen into the water.<br>
Moreover, in the fields of food, pharmacy, chemical industries, etc. it often needs to<br>
add gas into liquids. In various applications, liquid is not only limited to water, and gas is<br>
not only limited to oxygen or air either.<br>
However, in the existing technology, air is normally injected into liquids by means<br>
of a blower. As for the widely used biological treatment of waste water, the use of a<br>
blower would consume great amount of energy such as electricity, and would also cause<br>
environment pollution. In addition, using a blower to inject air directly into liquid, the<br>
oxygen dissolved in the liquid is very limited; instead, most of the air injected would be<br>
directly escaped from the liquid.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a liquid aeration system, which<br>
almost will not consume any energy and pollute environment, and the production cost will<br>
be greatly reduced.<br>
For achieving the above object, the present invention provides a liquid aeration<br>
system comprising: an intermittent liquid feeding means located at an upstream position for<br>
receiving liquid from a liquid resource; a liquid storage means located at an downstream<br>
position for receiving the liquid from the intermittent liquid feeding means quantitatively<br>
and intermittently; and a pipe connected between the intermittent liquid feeding means and<br>
the liquid storage means, the outlet of which is located below the liquid surface of the liquid<br>
storage means, such that the liquid can flow from the intermittent liquid feeding means<br>
through the pipe into the liquid storage means intermittently and quantitatively using the<br>
liquid level difference between the upstream position and the downstream position, so as to<br>
inject the air existed in the pipe into the liquid in the liquid storage means.<br>
The intermittent liquid feeding means may use various appropriate means available<br>
in the prior art, such as the types of an overturning panel, a tipping bucket, a floating ball, a<br>
damping returning valve, a siphon, and an inverted siphon etc., or the type of a solenoid<br>
valve with liquid level transducer or timer, as long as these structures can make the liquid in<br>
the liquid feeding means flow through the pipe into the liquid storage means intermittently<br>
and quantitatively, so as to inject the air in the pipe into the liquid in the liquid storage<br>
means.<br>
The liquid aeration system according to the present invention can automatically<br>
inject air into liquid by using the liquid level different (e.g. the universally existed water<br>
level difference in the nature) without the use of an air injecting means such as a blower.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, it will not consume energy and pollute environment, and will save the cost<br>
maximally.<br>
Moreover, when liquid is flowing through the pipe, the liquid would sufficiently<br>
contact with the air existed in the pipe, and the air can be sufficiently dissolved into the<br>
liquid. Thus, the dissolving degree of air in liquid is increased, and so the efficiency of<br>
injecting air into the liquid is increased, too.<br>
The other additional features and advantages of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the embodiments in conjunction with the accompany<br>
drawings.<br>

 <br>
Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, according to one typical embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
liquid aeration system comprises: an intermittent liquid feeding means 10 located at an<br>
upstream position for receiving liquid from a liquid source; a liquid storage means 20<br>
located at a downstream position for receiving the liquid from the intermittent liquid<br>
feeding means 10 intermittently and quantitatively; and a pipe 30 connected between the<br>
intermittent liquid feeding means 10 and the liquid storage means 20, the outlet of which is<br>
located below the liquid surface of the liquid storage means 20, such that the liquid can<br>
flow from the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 through the pipe 30 into the liquid<br>
storage means 20 intermittently and quantitatively using the liquid level difference between<br>
the upstream position and the downstream position, so as to inject the air existed in the pipe<br>
30 into the liquid in the liquid storage means 20.<br>
In this liquid aeration system, the energy to be used is the liquid potential (liquid<br>
level difference) existed between the upstream position and the downstream position,<br>
therefore, there is no need to use any additional aeration means such as a blower, and so it<br>
would not consume energy. When the present liquid aeration system is used for biological<br>
treatment of waste water, the water level difference commonly existed in the nature can be<br>
widely used, such as the water level difference between the waste water from sewage<br>
pipeline system or rainfall water and their downstream position, or the water level<br>
difference between different areas of terrain. When the present liquid aeration system is<br>
used for supplying oxygen to fishes in rivers or ponds for aquaculture, the water level<br>
difference produced either by the upstream river or by rainfall water can be widely used.<br>
Therefore, the liquid aeration system of the present invention can be widely and easily<br>
applied in various fields.<br>
The main function of the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 is to intermittently<br>
and quantitatively inject the air existed in the pipe 30 into the liquid in the liquid storage<br>
 <br>
means 20 located at the downstream position. Moreover, the intermittent liquid feeding<br>
means 10 also has the function of temporarily receiving and storing liquid, e.g. receiving<br>
liquid from the liquid source indicated by arrow A as shown in Fig. 1. When the liquid is<br>
accumulated to a certain amount, it will flow into the liquid storage means 20 through the<br>
pipe 30 as indicated by arrow B, thus, the air existed in the pipe 30 would be efficiently<br>
injected into the liquid in the liquid storage means 20. In addition, during the process that<br>
the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 is temporarily receiving and storing liquid, the<br>
pipe 30 may be open to atmosphere or other gas sources, and enable the pipe 30 being filled<br>
with gas such as air. When liquid is flowing through the pipe 30 into the liquid storage<br>
means 20, turbulence could be formed in the pipe 30 so as to facilitate the air existed in the<br>
pipe 30 to be sufficiently dissolved in the liquid. Every time when the liquid flows from<br>
the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 into the liquid storage means 20, the volume ratio<br>
of the quantity of the inflow liquid to the quantity of the air inside the pipe 30 may be in a<br>
certain value, so as to raise the dissolving efficiency of the air in the liquid. Preferably, the<br>
volume ratio of the quantity of the inflow liquid to the quantity of the air inside the pipe 30<br>
is 1:1 to 1:6.<br>
In order to inject the air inside the pipe 30 into the liquid in the liquid storage means<br>
20 located at the downstream position, it is required that the outlet of the pipe 30 should be<br>
located below the liquid surface of the liquid storage means 20 in operation, and preferably,<br>
very close to the bottom of the liquid storage means 20, allowing the injected air to have<br>
sufficient time to be dissolved in the liquid. If the liquid storage means 20 contains liquid<br>
therein at the beginning, the outlet of the pipe 30 can be directly put below the liquid<br>
surface; Otherwise, the outlet of the pipe 30 can be preset at the predetermined location in<br>
the liquid storage means 20, preferably, close to the bottom, so that after the liquid aeration<br>
system is operated for a period of time, the outlet of the pipe 30 would be actually located<br>
below the liquid surface of the liquid storage means 20.<br>
 <br>
For realizing the above functions, the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 can be<br>
various appropriate means available in the existing technologies, such as the types of<br>
overturning panel, tipping bucket, floating ball, damping returning valve, siphon, inverted<br>
siphon etc., or the type of solenoid valve with liquid level transducer or timer, so long as<br>
these structures can make the liquid stored in the liquid feeding means 10 flow through the<br>
pipe 30 intermittently and quantitatively into the liquid storage means 20, so as to inject the<br>
air existed in the pipe 30 into the liquid contained in the liquid storage means 20.<br>
As one embodiment, Fig. 1 shows an intermittent liquid feeding means 10.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 is a structure of<br>
overturning panel, which mainly includes a liquid feeding tank 10a and a rotatable<br>
overturning panel 13 installed in the liquid feeding tank 10a. When the overturning panel<br>
13 is in its original position (Fig. 1), the overturning panel 13 divides the liquid feeding<br>
tank 10a into a first portion 11 for receiving and storing liquid and a second portion 12<br>
communicating with the outlet of the pipe 30. When the liquid stored in the first portion 11<br>
is increased to a certain level, the overturning panel 13 begin to rotate from its original<br>
position by a certain angle in the direction indicated by the arrow X, such that the liquid<br>
stored in the first portion 11 flows into the second portion 12, and further flows through the<br>
pipe 30 into the liquid storage means 20 located at the downstream position.<br>
The rotation of the overturning panel 13 is preferably automatically realized by<br>
increasing the liquid level in the first portion 11, however, it can also be realized by a<br>
driving mechanism such as an electric motor. Although the latter will consume some energy,<br>
it could be used in some specific applications, for instance, it would be appropriate for a<br>
smaller sized goldfish tank at homes or in hotels to use a small electric motor to realize<br>
intermittent rotation of the overturning panel 13.<br>
 <br>
As an example of automatically realizing rotation of the overturning panel by using<br>
the increase of liquid level in the first portion 11, the overturning panel 13 can be hinged on<br>
the side wall of the liquid feeding tank 10a by means of a hinge shaft 14, which divides the<br>
overturning panel 13 into a lower part of the overturning panel 13 below the hinge shaft 14<br>
and an upper part of the overturning panel 13 above the hinge shaft 14, and the lower part of<br>
the overturning panel 13 is heavier than the upper part of the overturning panel 13, (e.g. the<br>
lower part can be made of a material different than the upper part, or a weight may be<br>
disposed on the lower part), and the upper part is longer than the lower part. When the<br>
liquid level in the first portion 11 is not high enough, due to the fact that the lower part of<br>
the overturning panel 13 is heavier and born bigger hydraulic pressure, the overturning<br>
panel 13 would not rotate. When the liquid level raises to a certain degree, the hydraulic<br>
pressure on the upper part of the overturning panel 13 would overcome the hydraulic<br>
pressure applied on and the gravity of the lower part of the overturning panel 13, the<br>
overturning panel 13 would automatically rotate around the hinge shaft in the direction<br>
indicated by the arrow X. Therefore, the liquid in the first portion 11 would flow into the<br>
second portion 12, and further flow via the pipe 30 into the liquid storage means 20 located<br>
at the downstream position.<br>
The weight of the lower part and the weight of the upper part of the overturning<br>
panel 13 as well as the location of the hinge shaft 14 will determine the quantity of liquid<br>
flowing from the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 (i.e. the liquid feeding tank 10a) into<br>
the liquid storage means 20, that is, realize the quantitative liquid feeding. And also, the<br>
mixing ratio of the quantity of liquid flown from the intermittent liquid feeding means 10<br>
into the liquid storage means 20 to the quantity of the air existed in the pipe 30 could be<br>
determined by designing, so as to raise the efficiency of dissolving air into the liquid.<br>
When the liquid level in the first portion 11 is not high enough, in order to ensure<br>
that the overturning panel 13 can not rotate and the liquid can be stored in the first portion<br>
11, a stop mechanism 15 can be provided to prevent the lower part of the overturning panel<br>
 <br>
13 from rotating towards the second portion 12 of the liquid feeding tank 10a. The stop<br>
mechanism 15 can be realized by simply attaching a stop block on the side wall of the<br>
intermittent liquid feeding means 10, however, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
stop block, for instance, it can be also realized by installing a spring mechanism.<br>
Moreover, after the liquid in the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 flows via the<br>
pipe 30 into the liquid storage means 20, in order to make the overturning panel 13 returns<br>
back to its original position, a position limit mechanism 16 may be provided for the<br>
overturning panel 13 so as to limit the rotating angle of the upper part of the overturning<br>
panel 13 towards the second portion 12 of the liquid feeding tank 10a. Such a position limit<br>
mechanism 16 can also be realized by simply installing a piece of stop block on the side<br>
wall of the intermittent liquid feeding means 10.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another type of intermittent liquid feeding means 10, which is similar<br>
with that shown in Fig. 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, this type of intermittent liquid feeding means 10 mainly<br>
includes a liquid feeding tank 10a and a rotatable overturning panel 13 which is<br>
horizontally installed on the bottom of the overturning panel 13. The overturning panel 13<br>
may be hinged on the bottom of the liquid feeding tank 10a via a hinge shaft 14, which<br>
divides the overturning panel 13 into the left part of the overturning panel 13 on the left side<br>
of the hinge shaft 14 and the right part of the overturning panel 13 on the right side of the<br>
hinge shaft 14, the area of the right part is smaller than that of the left part but the weight of<br>
the right part is heavier than that of the left part (this can be realized by using different<br>
materials or a weight). A stop block 15 is provided beneath the right part of the overturning<br>
panel 13. When the liquid in the liquid feeding tank 10a is insufficient, due to the fact that<br>
the right part of the overturning panel 13 is heavier and stopped by the stop block 15, the<br>
overturning panel 13 could not rotate. When the liquid in the liquid feeding tank 10a raised<br>
to a certain degree, the hydraulic pressure acting on the left part of the overturning panel 13<br>
 <br>
with bigger area would overcome the hydraulic pressure applied on the right part of the<br>
overturning panel 13 with smaller area and the gravity of the right part of the overturning<br>
panel 13, the overturning panel 13 will rotate around the hinge shaft 14 in the direction<br>
indicated by the arrow X, therefore, the liquid in the liquid feeding tank 1 Oa would directly<br>
flow via the pipe 30 into the liquid storage means 20 located at the downstream position.<br>
After the liquid in the liquid feeding means 10 is flown via the pipe 30 into the liquid<br>
storage means 20, in order to enable the overturning panel 13 return to its original position,<br>
the overturning panel 13 could be provided with a position limit stop block 16 which would<br>
limit the rotating angle of the overturning panel 13.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a tipping bucket type intermittent liquid feeding means 10, which is<br>
similar with that shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 mainly includes a<br>
liquid feeding tank 10a and a rotatable tipping bucket 13 installed in the liquid feeding tank<br>
10a. When the tipping bucket 13 is in its original position (as shown in Fig. 3), the tipping<br>
bucket 13 is used for receiving and storing liquid, as shown by the arrow A. When the<br>
liquid stored in the tipping bucket 13 is increased to a certain amount, the tipping bucket 13<br>
would rotate from its original position by a certain angle, enable the liquid stored in the<br>
tipping bucket 13 flow into the liquid feeding tank 10a and further flow via the pipe 30 into<br>
the liquid storage means 20 located at the downstream position.<br>
Same as the above overturning panel, the tipping bucket of this embodiment can<br>
also be rotated by various means and in various manners, but preferably in the manner of<br>
automatic rotation realized by increasing the liquid level.<br>
To this end, the tipping bucket 13 can be hinged on the side wall of the liquid<br>
feeding tank 10a via a hinge shaft 14, which divides the tipping bucket 13 into the left part<br>
of the tipping bucket 13 on the left side of the hinge shaft 14 and the right part of the tipping<br>
 <br>
bucket 13 on the right side of the hinge shaft 14, the left part is heavier than the right part<br>
(e.g. a weight is provided on the left part, as indicated by the shadow portion at the left side<br>
of the tipping bucket 13 in Fig. 3), moreover, the right part is longer than the left part. The<br>
tipping bucket 13 is provided with a stop mechanism such as a stop block 15 which can<br>
prevent the left part of the tipping bucket 13 from rotating downwards, and a position limit<br>
mechanism such as a stop block 16 which can limit the right part of the tipping bucket 13<br>
from rotating downwards. When the liquid level in the tipping bucket 13 is insufficient, due<br>
to the fact that the left part of the tipping bucket 13 is heavier and stopped by the stop block<br>
15, the tipping bucket 13 can not rotate. When the liquid level is increased to a certain<br>
degree, the liquid gravity applied on the right part of the tipping bucket 13 would overcome<br>
the liquid gravity applied on the left part of the tipping bucket 13 and its own gravity, so as<br>
to enable the tipping bucket 13 rotate around the hinge shaft 14 in the direction indicated by<br>
the arrow X, thus, the liquid in the tipping bucket 13 would flow to the liquid feeding tank<br>
10a and further flow via the pipe 30 into the liquid storage means 20 located at the<br>
downstream position.<br>
Through the above stated embodiments, the intermittent liquid feeding means 10 of<br>
the present invention has been explained. However, it is obvious that the present invention<br>
is not limited to these embodiments. As for a person skilled in this field, many other<br>
appropriate structures may be adopted for the realization of the intermittent liquid feeding<br>
means 10 of the present invention. For instance, in the existing technologies, the normally<br>
used floating ball type, damping returning valve type, siphon type, inverted siphon type and<br>
solenoid valves with liquid level transducer or timer etc. could be used for realizing the<br>
intermittent liquid feeding means 10 of the present invention, and their detailed description<br>
will be omitted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the liquid aeration system may also include a liquid stirring means 40 located at the inlet 31<br>
of the pipe 30, for stirring the liquid flowing into the pipe 30 so that the liquid can be<br>
sufficiently mixed with the air existed in the pipe 30.<br>
 <br>
As an example, a liquid stirring means 40 is shown in Fig. 3, which mainly includes<br>
an impeller 41 rotatably disposed at the inlet 31 of the pipe 30. The liquid flowing into the<br>
pipe 30 impulses the blades of the impeller 41 and make the impeller 41 rotate, thus, the<br>
liquid is stirred and the air existed in the pipe 30 is sufficiently dissolved into the liquid.<br>
Obviously, the liquid stirring means 40 of the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above example. It is obvious for those skilled in the art that any appropriate stirring means<br>
in the existing technologies can be used to realize the liquid stirring means 40 of the present<br>
invention, such as turbine type, blade type etc. According to the sort of energy sources, the<br>
liquid stirring means can be driven by hydraulic head, wind power, solar energy and<br>
electricity etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the liquid aeration<br>
system may further comprises a sprayer (not shown) disposed at the inlet 31 of the pipe 30,<br>
for dividing the liquid into a plurality of streamlets or droplets and spraying them into the<br>
pipe 30, so that the liquid can be sufficiently mixed with the air existed in the pipe 30. The<br>
sprayer can be constructed as a spraying nozzle or a screen. The sprayer can be used<br>
independently from or in combination with the liquid stirring means 40.<br>
According to the present invention, the inlet of the pipe 30 is opened to atmosphere<br>
or connected directly with other gas sources so that the pipe 30 is full of air or gas.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to install a branch pipe on the pipe 30, and the gas can be<br>
injected into the pipe 30 via the branch pipe.<br>
In order to make the air inside the pipe 30 sufficiently pre-dissolved into the liquid<br>
flowing through the pipe 30, the pipe 30 is preferably designed as a Z shape or a spiral<br>
shape, thus, the mixing time for the liquid flowing through the pipe 30 and air inside the<br>
pipe 30 would be longer and/or increase the air quantity inside the pipe 30.<br>
 <br>
For increasing the air dissolved in the liquid, the liquid is preferably flowing<br>
through the pipe 30 in the form of turbulence, which can be realized by properly designing<br>
of the liquid feeding means 10 and/or the pipe 30. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, the pipe<br>
30 may be designed as a plurality section pipes mutually connected with each other, making<br>
the outlet of upper section pipe obliquely insert into the inlet of next section pipe at their<br>
connecting points so as to form turbulence.<br>
When the liquid aeration system of the present invention is used for biological<br>
treatment of waste water, as shown in Fig. 1, a biological rotary pan or a biological filtering<br>
bed may be installed in the liquid storage means 20 such as an aeration tank. The biological<br>
filtering bed 50 may possess huge amount of aerobic microorganisms. The biological<br>
filtering bed is disposed above the outlet of the pipe 30, so that the injected air is forced to<br>
pass through the filtering bed when floating up, therefore, the function of absorbing,<br>
adsorbing and oxidized decomposing of the microorganisms can be realized effectively.<br>
The application of the liquid aeration system of the present invention doesn't need<br>
any air blasting means such as blower, thus, it almost will not consume any energy,<br>
production cost will be greatly reduced and it is very environment friendly. In addition, in<br>
the present invention, the air is injected by liquid into the liquid in the liquid storage means<br>
20, therefore, compared with directly blowing air into liquid by a blower in the existing<br>
technology, the air can be more sufficiently dissolved in liquid. Moreover, through proper<br>
designing of the structures of the pipe 30 and other parts, such as increasing the turbulence<br>
inside the pipe 30 and adding liquid stirring means 40 etc., the efficiency of the air<br>
dissolving in the liquid can be increased.<br>
