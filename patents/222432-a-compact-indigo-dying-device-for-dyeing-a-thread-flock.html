the bottom ends thereof for guiding the movement of the threads in the baths.. A set of squeeze rolls is provided alongwith a set of pneumatic pressure rolls having balancer provided therewith, over the dyeing baths for squeezing the thread after dyeing and washing of the thread. Another guide roll and a support alongwith a leasing are provided on the other side of the main frame for guiding the movement of the thread and supporting the back beam of yarn. A motor is supported on the bottom of the frame for providing movement to the guide rolls, squeeze rolls and other components of the dyeing machine. A speed controller and temperature ~ontraller are provided on the front side of the main frame of the machine. Indicators are also provided on the front side of the machine. A reverse and forward movement means are provided at the front side of the machine such that to be operated the machine in both directions. A plurality of fans/blower are provided on either sides of the main frame for providing air to the threads for oxidation and/or drying purposes.. Means are provided with the blowers to provide hot air as and when required..<br><br>
An indigo dyeing machine according to ~a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br><br>
Fig..1 shows the plan view of the dyeing machine.<br><br><br>
Referring to the drawings the indigo dyeing machine of this invention has a dyeing baths 4 and 4a supported on the main frame F of the dyeing machine for containing Wyeing material/dye therein. Bath 4a (not shown) is provided behind the bath 4.. An outlet 17 is provided near the bottom of the baths 4 and 4a for draining the contents from the baths.. A dye storage tank 19 is provided over the dyeing baths 4 and 4a for supplying the dyeing material into the dyeing baths as and when required by the user. A support S is provided at one side of main frame F for supporting the beam of yarn 1. A guide role 2 and a leasing for yarn 3 is provided at the same side for guiding the movement of the yarn. Another guide role 5 is provided in the dyeing baths 4 and 4A for guiding the movement of the yarn in the baths. A set of squeeze rolls 6 and 7 alongwith the pneumatic means 18<br><br>
are provided over the baths 4 and 4A for squeezing the yarns/threads each time after dyeing/washing of the threads,. A second leasing 8 and a guide roller 9 and a support 51 are provided on the other side of the main frame F for guiding the movement of the yarns and to facilitate the collection of the yarn over the beam 1W. ~ motor 12 is mounted on the bottom of the main frame F for providing movements to all the components of the indigo dye machine.

Durinq the process of dyeing a beam of undyed yarn I. is prepared and mounted on the support attached with dyeing machine. Sheets of undyed yarns are passed into dyebath 4 with help of guide roller 2. A yarn leasing facility 3 provided to prevent entanglement of<br><br><br><br><br><br>
yarns~. flyebath 4 has indigo dye in reduce form.. To guide yarns a flexible guide roll 5 is provided in the dye baths 4 and 4a.. These yarns are then passed through a set. of PVC coated rollers called squeeze roller 6 and<br><br>
7. Roller 6 has a positive motion through a motor 12 mounted on the plateform. While roller number 7 has pneumatic pressure provision and mounted on balancer 18. These yarns/threads are passed through these rollers and squeezed to remove excess of dye liquor and then after leasing 8. and collected on second beam 1W with the help of guide roll 9. Motion of front beam I and yarn collecting beam 1QJ is given by chain system and syncronised with the speed of squeeze rollers. These one time dyed yarns are again passed through second dye bath provided on the backside of the machine by reversing the motion of the machine. These yarns are squeezed and collected on the front beam I. This process is repeated several time as per the requirement of shade. After getting proper shade dye liquor from the both dye bath is removed and these dye bath is filled with washing liquor for washing unfixed dye from the yarn. After washing yarns are squeezed and dryed by using hot air and collected on the back beam 1W..<br><br><br><br><br>
