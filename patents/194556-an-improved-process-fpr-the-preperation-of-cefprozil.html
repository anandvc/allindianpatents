(6R,7R)-7-[2-Amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-[(Z)-propenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid DMF solvate (XIV) (llOg) was stirred in water (160ml) at 30°C for 40min. The Crude compound was collected by filtration and washed with water (30ml) followed by acetone (30ml). The<br><br>
wet crude was dried in vacuum at room temp to give dried material which was then stirred in water (140ml) at 15°C, pH was adjusted to 1.0 using 1:1 HCl to get clear solution. Then pH was readjusted to 5.0 using 10% ammonia solution at 15 to 20°C. The precipitate was cooled to 2 to 5°C, stirred for 1.5hr, filtered and washed with water (30ml) followed by acetone (30ml) and dried in vacuum at room temperature to give the title compound (yield 65g, 99.1%pure, moisture content 5.5%),<br><br><br>

10.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the silylation in step (vi) is carried out in the presence of solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbons, ethyl acetate or cyclohexane.<br>
11.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the condensation in step (vii) is carried out in the presence of halogenated solvents such as methylenechloride, CCI4 or CHCI3.<br>
12.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the condensation in step (vii) is carried out using a base such as triethylamine, N-methyl morpholine, diethylamine and the like.<br>
13.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the desolvation in step (viii) is carried out using solvent such as water, or water-alcohol mixture.<br><br>
14.	The process as claimed in claim 13, wherein the alcohol is selected from methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol.<br>
