				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to method and system of performance evaluation of<br>
arc welding power source to ensure quality of welding in a continuous<br>
manner.<br>
The invention is related to the filed of welding engineering and in particular<br>
to the equipments and power supply for arc welding using electric arc as<br>
source of melting. More precisely the work is related to power source that<br>
supplies electric current to produce electric arc. Since the range of electric<br>
current used for welding is in order of few hundreds of amperes and voltage<br>
in few tens, power supplies are exclusively made for this purpose. These<br>
power supplies are basically a type of machines but specifically made for<br>
welding applications.<br>
Maintenance of quality of welding without interruption is a prime need to<br>
ensure metallurgical and mechanical characteristics of the welding. The<br>
present invention has been developed with this aim by evaluating<br>
performance of welding power source, which is unique in itself.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Welding power sources are manufactured in many countries. In most of the<br>
developed countries like, US, UK, Germany, Japan etc, they have their own<br>
standards. The welding power source manufacturers test their power sources<br>
as per their countries standards and deliver them to the buyers.<br>
Welding power source is equipment that supplies voltage and current to<br>
produce electric arc. This arc is a source of heat for melting the materials to<br>
be joined. Continuous and stable arc is essential for achieving good quality<br>
welding and welding power source generates this arc. Welding equipment<br>
manufacturers test the power sources for electrical characteristics and safety<br>
requirements. But welding performance test is not carried out generally.<br>
Presently there is no method of testing available for characterizing the<br>
welding power source for its welding qualities. This invention provide a<br>
systematic methodology for testing static and dynamic characteristics of the<br>
welding power sources to determine the stability of arc, ignition<br>
characteristics of the arc and the spatter characteristics of the arc. Hence the<br>
performance of the welding power source is uniquely evaluated by this<br>
procedure.<br>
The present invention is aimed at developing method for testing of welding<br>
power sources to maintain the quality and the performance characteristics of<br>
the welding power sources.<br>
According to another object of the invention the present invention develops<br>
a equipment installation for testing performance characteristics of the<br>
welding power sources.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to evaluate dynamic characteristics of<br>
the arc welding power source by a data acquisition system to find out arc<br>
stability index, arc ignition index and spatter index thus enabling to secure<br>
quality level of the arc welding power source.<br>
Though this invention is aimed at testing of welding power source, but it can<br>
be used for testing any power sources generating arc.<br>
Accordingly to the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
performance evaluation of arc welding power source to control quality level<br>
of welding power source comprising the steps of measuring the static and<br>
dynamic characteristics of welding power source by measuring the open<br>
circuit voltage of the welding power source, measuring arc current and arc<br>
voltage at different current settings of the welding generator, measuring<br>
short circuit voltage and current at different current settings of the welding<br>
generator, measuring open circuit voltage are current and arc voltage for<br>
voltage stabilization test, testing load of the said generator for a required<br>
time, performing energy efficiency test of welding by measuring input<br>
voltage and input current and performing testing for dynamic characteristic<br>
by obtaining the required arc stability index, arc ignition index and spatter<br>
index by processing recorded data of welding voltage and welding current at<br>
real time through a data acquisition equipment to ensure quality of welding<br>
in a continuous manner.<br>
The invention also relates to a system for performance evaluation of arc<br>
welding power source to control quality level of the welding power source<br>
comprising welding power source maintained for load at voltage, between a<br>
current sensor (2) to capture welding current to feed it to a microprocessor<br>
(4) through a analog signal conditioner (3), the microprocessor being linked<br>
to a computer (5) to evaluate the required static and dynamic characteristics<br>
of the welding power source, the said dynamic characteristics being obtained<br>
as arc stability index, arc ignition index and arc spatter index by processing<br>
recorded data of welding voltage and welding current stored in<br>
microprocessor (4) at real time to ensure good quality of welding in a<br>
continuous manner.<br>
A welding power source is utilized for creating welding arc and carrying out<br>
welding operation. Since there are many welding power source<br>
manufacturers and each one of them claim that their power source is the best<br>
power source, a method is formulated to evaluate the performance of these<br>
power sources.<br>
A method for performance evaluation of arc welding power sources has been<br>
developed for evaluation of given welding power source.<br>
The static characteristic tests reveal the performance of welding power<br>
source at static condition. Dynamic characteristics are evaluated during<br>
welding operation. The following procedure is adopted for measurements of<br>
static and dynamic characteristics of the arc welding power source.<br>
1. MEASUREMENT OF OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE OF THE<br>
WELDING POWER SOURCE<br>
For Welding transformer rectifiers and solid state power sources:<br>
The open circuit voltage is measured using a voltmeter, for a given power<br>
source. The given power source may be of two types. Either it may of<br>
constant current type or it may be of constant potential type.<br>
CONSTANT CURRENT POWER SOURCE: There will be a single value<br>
for the open circuit voltage. This voltage is measured using a voltmeter and<br>
noted down.<br>
CONSTANT VOLTAGE POWER SOURCES. There will be a provision for<br>
variation of the output voltages. Hence this output voltage is varied by<br>
changing the appropriate tap changing switch and the different output<br>
voltages are measured using a voltmeter and the values are noted down.<br>
FOR WELDING GENERATORS:<br>
The generator will be having different output voltage for each current<br>
settings. Hence the output current is changed for two different ranges and<br>
the list output voltage and the current settings are measured using a<br>
voltmeter and noted.<br>
The open circuit voltage forms a one point on the point on the static<br>
characteristics graph.<br>
2.MEASUREMENT OF ARC VOLTAGE &amp; CURRENT AT<br>
DIFFERENT CURRENT SETTINGS<br>
Welding is carried out at different pre-determined values of current and the<br>
value of the welding voltage and welding current are measured using a<br>
voltmeter and one ammeter. These data gives one set of operating points for<br>
each setting of welding current. Hence the second set of points for the static<br>
characteristics graph is obtained. If the welding power source is rated 400<br>
amperes, then there may be four set of points; one set of points at each 100<br>
amps.<br>
3. MEASUREMENT OF SHORT CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND SHORT<br>
CIRCUIT CURRENT AT DIFFERENT CURRENT SETTINGS.<br>
The welding electrode is short circuited at different welding current settings<br>
and the voltage and current values are measured, using voltmeter and<br>
ammeter. The different current settings chosen can be at 100 amps intervals.<br>
This gives the third set of points for each current setting.<br>
4. MAINS VOLTAGE STABILISATION TEST<br>
In this test input voltage is varied and output parameters such as OCV, arc<br>
voltage and arc current are measured. The input voltage can be varied by<br>
using a 3 phase auto transformer. We can choose various input voltages<br>
like, 360, 380, 400, 420 and 440 volts. For each of this voltage setting the<br>
output voltage is measured and a table is prepared. If there is any variation<br>
of the input voltage, how much variation is available in the output voltage is<br>
known.<br>
5. LOAD TEST<br>
In this test a resistive load, which can take up to 600 amps for 10 minutes is<br>
connected at the out put terminals of the power source. The capacity of the<br>
equipment to deliver the set current continuously for the required time as per<br>
the duty cycle rating is tested. No abnormal temperature raise should be<br>
seen during this period.<br>
6. ENERGY EFFICIENCY TEST<br>
In this test the welding is done at different current settings and the voltage,<br>
output current, input voltage and input current are measured. From this data<br>
the no load losses and the efficiency of the power source is estimated. Also<br>
the open circuit voltage curve is recorded to know the ripple contents of the<br>
output. The no load losses are calculated.<br>
The efficiency of the power source= output power/ input power x 100%<br>
Output power=arc voltage x arc current<br>
Input power= 1.732 x Input voltage x Input current x power factor<br>
The input power for Zero output current is known as the no load losses.<br>
7. DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS TEST<br>
In this test, a data acquisition system captures welding voltage and welding<br>
current in real time and the recorded data is processed by a computer<br>
through a software and the following index values are calculated and<br>
displayed along with the wave form recording.<br>
a. Arc stability index<br>
b. Arc ignition index<br>
c. Spatter index<br>
The arc stability index value indicates the stability of the arc produced by the<br>
power source under test while ensuring the quality of the welding<br>
consumable and the welder, The arc ignition index indicates the re-ignition<br>
characteristic of the extinguished arc during short circuits. The spatter index<br>
is an indication of spatter produced by the arc during welding.<br>
All the above tests are to be carried out in addition to the various type<br>
routine tests conducted by different manufactures as per relevant standards.<br>
The nature of the invention and its performance will be better explained<br>
from the following description in relation to non limiting embodiments with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 is the integrated equipment installation for evaluation of welding<br>
power source and<br>
Figure 2 represents the dynamic characteristics stability index, ignition index<br>
and spatter index of the power source in the graph generated in the screen.<br>
Figure 3 is another example of the dynamic characteristics of the power<br>
source represented by a graph generated in the screen.<br>
Figure 3 is another example of the dynamic characteristics of the power<br>
source represented by a graph.<br>
Dynamic characteristics of welding power source, plays an important role in<br>
determining the quality of weld. Arc ignition, arc stability, and spatter level<br>
are the factors that influence the dynamic characteristics of the welding<br>
power source. It is therefore necessary to record the arc ignition<br>
characteristics, arc stability characteristics and spatter characteristics. For<br>
this a microprocessor based data acquisition system and signal conditioners<br>
have been designed and developed. The acquired data is then transferred to<br>
the personal computer and evaluated.<br>
Arc stability is required to be evaluated for arc welding. If the arc current is<br>
stable and continuous without any variations, then the arc stability can be<br>
said to be 100%. But, invariably, due to inherent nature of arc, during<br>
welding the arc current value varies and the stability value drops lower than<br>
100%.<br>
When the welding is carried out, whenever the wire touches the plate, the arc<br>
extinguishes. If the arc re-strikes immediately within 15 milliseconds, then<br>
we can say that the arc ignition is very good. It is found that for a very good<br>
power source this re-striking time is 3 milliseconds. If within 15<br>
milliseconds, and within 3 to 5 pulses, the arc re-strikes, the welding power<br>
source is said to have a good arc re-ignition capability (Fig-3).<br>
If there are no current pulses, then there will be no spatter. The extent to<br>
which the deviation is there, to that extent we will have spatter. Hence, the<br>
spatter index qualifies the welding power source to be spatter free or not.<br>
In fig 1, there is a welding power source (1), which is under test. There are<br>
two cables connected to positive and negative terminals of the power source.<br>
From the positive terminal, the welding electrode holder is connected. The<br>
negative cable is connected to the plate (P) to be welding. The welder will<br>
take the electrode holder and fix an electrode and strike an arc on the plate<br>
and the welder will move the arc thus carrying out the arc welding.<br>
The necessary welding voltage and welding current are supplied by this<br>
welding power source. In order to sense the welding current, a low<br>
resistance shunt (current sensor) is connected along the negative cable,<br>
which is transmitting the welding current from the arc to the welding power<br>
source. When this current passes through the shunt, a small voltage signal is<br>
produced along the shunt which is transmitted to the microprocessor board<br>
(4) through the analog conditioner unit (3). The welding voltage is<br>
measured by connecting two wires across the two terminals of the power<br>
source. This voltage is also sent to the micro processor board through the<br>
analog signal conditioner unit.<br>
The data acquired during welding is stored in the memory of the<br>
microprocessor. From this it is transmitted to the personal computer (5). In<br>
the computer, there is a software which will analyse this welding data and<br>
give the values of stability index, ignition index and the spatter index along<br>
with the display of the arc welding voltage and current waveform.<br>
As in Figs. 2 and 3 when the data of the graph is processed using the<br>
requisite software, we will get the result of the calculations for the three<br>
indices. By this software the indices are calculated and printed along with<br>
the graph.<br>
The deviation of the current pulse values from the average current value is<br>
calculated as a percentage variation of the current pulses. This percentage<br>
can be used as a factor for evaluation of the arc stability for a given power<br>
source. If the arc stability index is found above 75 percent, the stability and<br>
weld bead formation are satisfactory. From the graph in Fig. 3, it is seen that<br>
the thyristor controlled power source is having very good arc stability of the<br>
order of 95 for a given current value.<br>
During the arc welding, whenever the electrode or the welding wire touches<br>
the base plate, the arc extinguishes and the current rises high to clear the<br>
short circuit and the arc is re-established. This mechanism is called arc<br>
ignition or re-ignition. By recording the arc ignition, or the re-ignition, the<br>
time required for the arc to reach stability is calculated. During this period<br>
there will be a single pulse or a bunch of pulses before the arc is re-<br>
established. Alter conducting several experiments, it is concluded that if the<br>
pulse duration is less than 5 millisecs or there are less than 4 pulses within a<br>
period of 15 millisecs, the arc ignition characteristics are satisfactory.<br>
The difference between the average current and the average current pulse<br>
gives the factor which is proportional to the spatter level at given current<br>
level. If correct value of choke connected in the welding power source is<br>
chosen then this factor is minimum. If the difference is zero then it means<br>
that there is no current pulse. It has been established after conducting<br>
several experiments that if this difference is large then it means that the<br>
current pulses are narrow, the choke value is less and there will be excess<br>
spatter. If the ratio of average current pulse to average current is more than<br>
2, then heavy spatter occurs. If the power source is properly designed with<br>
necessary chokes there will be no spatter. If the choke value is low then<br>
there will be excess spatter.<br>
For a given spatter index of 1.1 means that the instantaneous variations in<br>
the arc currents are less than 20 percent.<br>
Hence in this manner all the information about the arc namely arc ignition,<br>
arc stability and arc spatter are evaluated from the dynamic characteristics of<br>
the power sources.<br>

limiting embodiments as defined by accompanying claims.<br>
