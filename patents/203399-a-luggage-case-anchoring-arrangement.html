Figs 6 and 7 are enlarged scrap views at X and Y in Figs 2 and 4, respectively;<br>
Fig 8 is exploded view of the anchoring arrangement of Fig 1;<br>
Figs 9 and 10 are cut section partial isometric views of a housing of a multilever barrel lock and fastening means of the anchoring arrangement of Fig 1 prior to anchoring or fastening of the insert to the slide; and<br>
Figs 11 and 12 are cut section partial isometric views of the housing of the multilever barrel lock and fastening means of the anchoring arrangement of Fig 1 after anchoring or fastening of the insert to the slide,<br>
As illustrated in Figs 1 to 12 of the accompanying drawings, the anchoring arrangement 1 comprises a channel member 2 provided with legs 2a (Fig 8). The channel member is fitted to the sidewall 3 of the bottom shell 4 of a luggage case such as suitcase 5 at one side thereof by securing legs 2a thereof through corresponding holes 3a in the sidewall of the bottom shell and folding the legs against the sidewall of the bottom shell (Fig 8). In the case of a luggage case which is with reinforcing metallic frame reference the numeral 3 indicates the metaUic frame around the sidewall of the bottom shell of the luggage case. Channel member 2 is provided with an oblong slot 6 along the web portion 7 thereof (Figs 5 and 8). 8 is a slider slidably<br>
6<br><br>
engaged in the oblong slot and provided with a curved projection 9 at the inner surface thereof (Figs 6, 7, and 8). The slider is made of plastics such as nylon and provided with protrusions 8a and 8b at the inner surface thereof. The curved projection is made of steel wire inserted in the slider during moulding thereof. 11 is a spring steel strip provided with a longitudinal slot 1 la at one end and a hole 1lb at the other end (Fig 8). The one end of the spring steel strip is fixed at the inner surface of the slider by engaging the protrusions 8a and 8b of the slider in the longitudinal slot 1la in the spring steel strip and melting the protrusions against the spring steel strip (Figs 6 and 7). The other end of the spring steel strip is biased towards the web portions 7 of the channel member (Fig 7). 12 is a button fitted in the hole at the other end of the spring steel strip and adapted to snap fit in opening 13 in the web portion 7 of the channel member in the proximity of one end of the oblong slot (Figs 6 and 8).14 is a cable disposed in the channel member looped around the curved portion. The cable may be a plastic coated steel wire. The inner end of the cable is fixed to the sidewall of the bottom shell of the luggage case in the proximity of the said one end of the oblong slot. The location of fixation of the inner end of the cable is marked 15. The outer end of the cable protrudes out of the channel member through one end thereof. 16 is a plug fitted to the outer end of the cable. 17 is a collar across the plug. Plug 16 is adapted to be push fitted in the said one end of the channel member against the collar. Plug 16 is provided with an insert 18 having a tapered tip 19 and an open slot 20 at one face thereof. 21 is a slide disposed<br>
7<br><br>
in a recess 22 in the housing 23 of a multibarrel lock 24 fitted at the front side of the luggage case. The slide is held compressed by spring 25 against the barrel lock. Spring 25 is located in a groove 26 in the housing. The slide and cover plate 27 of the housing of the barrel lock are provided with corresponding slots 28 and 29 respectively. 30 is a cam provided on the barrel lock to operate the shde. 31, 32, 33 and 34 screw holes in the housing. In the clamped position of the slider the button is engaged in the opening and the slider cannot be moved in the oblong slot. On pushing the button out of the opening and moving the other end of the spring steel strip away from the web portion of the channel member, the slider is free to be moved (Fig 7). The plug is pulled out from the one end of the channel member and the cable is pulled out of the channel member holding the plug. Because the cable is looped around the curved projection of the slider, the slider moves in the left hand direction along with the cable (Fig 3). On locking the barrel lock by turning it in the anticlockwise direction using a key (not shown) in known manner, the cam on the barrel lock rotates with the barrel lock anticlockwise and disengages from the shde. As a result the shde displaces in the direction of the barrel lock with the force of the spring. When the shde is displaced in the direction of the barrel lock, the slot in the shde lies offset with the slot in the cover plate. The cable is run around a rigid or fixed member such as leg of a seat in a train (not shown) or a post (not shown) and the tip of the insert is pushed inside the slots of the cover plate and shde. The tip of the insert slides against the shde into the recess in the housing of the multilever barrel<br>
8<br><br>
lock through corresponding slots in the cover plate and the slide against the force of the spring and engages over the slide at the open slot in the insert. The taper at the tip of the insert facilitates sliding of the insert into the recess against the slide. When the insert slides into the recess against the slide the spring gets compressed till the insert engages over the slide at the open slot Thereafter, the spring expands and pushes the slide in the direction of the barrel lock. The slide lies spring stressed in the direction of the barrel lock off set with the slot in the cover plate. As a result the insert is spring stressed against the sidewall of the slot in the cover plate and cannot be disengaged from the slide and pulled out (Figs 11 and 12). The insert thus remains anchored or fastened to the slide. The suitcase is anchored to the rigid or fixed member as long as the suitcase is kept locked. On unlocking the barrel lock by turning it in the clockwise direction using a key (not shown) in known manner, the cam rotates with the barrel lock clockwise and pushes and displaces the slide in the direction of the spring and the spring gets compressed. The slots in the slide and cover plate are aligned and the insert is free to be disengaged from the slots. (Figs 9 and 10). The suitcase is unfastened from the rigid or fixed member by disengaging the cable. On moving the slider in the right-hand direction (Fig 2), the cable moves with the slider as the cable is looped around the curved projection of the slider. When the cable is fully retracted the plug is push fitted at the said one end of the channel member. The collar across the plug abuts against the said one<br>
9 <br>
end of the channel member and prevents the plug from entering the channel member fully. On being retracted fully, the button of the slider snap fits in the opening under the influence of the spring steel strip and the slider remains clamped to the channel member (Fig 6).<br>
According to the invention the luggage case anchoring mechanism comprises less number of component parts and is, therefore, simple in construction, reliable and economical. Due to the inner end of the cable being fixed to the luggage case, no load is transferred to or borne by the slider and the cable fitting is rigid and sturdy and the anchoring arrangement of the invention is also sturdy.<br><br>
10<br>
The clamping means and fastening means may be of different constructions. The plastic coated steel wire is smooth to handle. The cable may, however, be of different material or construction and need not be plastic coated. Instead of curved projection, a ring or eye or lug or C- or U-shaped projection or such other feature may be provided to entangle the cable. Such variations of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
