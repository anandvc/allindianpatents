APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR DIAGNOSING<br>
MOTOR-RESOLVER SYSTEM FAULTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00011    The present invention generally relates to motor-resolver systems,<br>
and more particularly relates to apparatus and methods for diagnosing faults in<br>
multiple, associated motor-resolver systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Motor-resolver systems are typically employed to accurately sense<br>
and control the position of rotating shafts. As a motor is employed to a<br>
resolvcr at a particular rate or rotational velocity, the output of the resolver is<br>
then fed to a motor controller to determine if the motor is properly driving the<br>
shafts. When a resolver anomaly is detected, the motor controller notifies the<br>
user with an error message (e.g., a visual warning, an audio warning, etc.).<br>
[0003] Some devices (e.g., a hybrid vehicle) include multiple motors (and<br>
multiple resolvers) coupled to a single motor controller. In these devices, the<br>
motor controller often includes a resolver decoder for each respective resolver.<br>
For example, a hybrid vehicle includes a first motor for operation with the<br>
electric portion of the vehicle, and a second motor for operation with the<br>
combustion portion of the vehicle. The resolver associated with the first<br>
motor is coupled to a first resolver decoder, and the resolver associated with<br>
the second motor is coupled to a second resolver decoder within the common<br>
motor controller.<br>
[0004] There are times, however, when one of the resolvers is<br>
malfunctioning and the motor controller transmits a warning to the user<br>
indicating that the motor coupled to the malfunctioning resolver is not<br>
working properly when in fact, it is the resolver decoder that is not working<br>
properly.   Thus, it is often difficult to determine which of the resolver or the<br><br>
2<br>
resolver decoder is malfunctioning when the motor controller transmits an<br>
error message.<br>
[0005] Since replacing a motor (and resolver) or a motor controller are<br>
expensive, it is desirable to provide efficient systems and methods for testing a<br>
motor (via its resolver) and a resolver decoder coupled to the resolver to<br>
determine which of the motor/resolver and the motor controller is<br>
malfunctioning when the motor controller transmits an error message without<br>
replacing the motor or motor controller of a vehicle system (e.g., a hybrid<br>
vehicle system). Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of<br>
the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and this background of the invention.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Various exemplary embodiments of the invention provide apparatus<br>
and methods for diagnosing faults in multiple, associated motor-resolver<br>
systems. For multiple, associated motor-resolver systems including a first<br>
resolver, a second resolver, and a motor controller including a first decoder<br>
and a second decoder, one system includes a first swapping circuit selectively<br>
coupling the first resolver to the first decoder or the second decoder, and a<br>
second swapping circuit selectively coupling the second resolver to the first<br>
decoder or the second decoder.<br>
[0007] For multiple, associated motor-resolver systems including (i) a first<br>
motor resolver that transmits a first resolver signal to a first decoder and (ii) a<br>
second motor resolver that transmits a second resolver signal to a second<br>
decoder, wherein the first and second decoders are each configured to detect<br>
fault conditions represented in the first and second resolver signals,<br>
respectively, and configured to generate a first and second fault signal,<br>
respectively, in response to detecting a fault condition, and wherein the first<br><br>
3<br>
fault signal has been generated, one method for diagnosing faults includes the<br>
step of applying the second signal to the first decoder to determine that the<br>
first decoder is malfunctioning if the first decoder continues to generate the<br>
first fault signal. This method also includes the step of applying the first<br>
signal to the second decoder to determine that the first motor is malfunctioning<br>
if the second decoder generates the second fault signal.<br>
[0008] One method for diagnosing faults in multiple, associated motor-<br>
resolver systems including a first motor having an associated first resolver, a<br>
second motor having a second associated resolver, and a motor controller<br>
having a first decoder and a second decoder includes the steps of transmitting<br>
a first signal from the first resolver to the first decoder and transmitting a<br>
second signal from the second resolver to the second decoder. This method<br>
also includes the steps of transmitting a third signal from the first resolver to<br>
the second decoder and transmitting a fourth signal from the second resolver<br>
to the first decoder. After the first, second, third, and fourth signals are<br>
transmitted, which of the first decoder, the second decoder, the first motor, or<br>
the second motor is malfunctioning can be determined.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The following detailed description of the invention is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the<br>
application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be<br>
bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention<br>
or the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 is a schematic of a prior art system 10 including a motor-<br>
resolver system 100 and a motor-resolver system 150. Motor-resolver system<br>
100 includes a resolver 105 coupled to a motor 110. Resolver 105 is<br>
configured to transmit signals representing the operating characteristics (e.g.,<br>
motor speed, rotor angle, signal strength, connectivity, etc.) of motor 110 to a<br>
motor controller 120.<br>
[0018] Similarly, motor-resolver system 150 includes a resolver 155 coupled<br>
to a motor 160. Resolver 155 is also configured to transmit signals<br>
representing the operating characteristics of motor 160 to motor controller<br>
120.<br>
[0019] Motor controller 120 includes a resolver decoder 1250 for receiving<br>
signals from resolver 105 and a resolver decoder 1275 for receiving signals<br>
from resolver 155. Resolver decoders 1250 and 1275 are each configured to<br>
monitor the operating characteristics of their respective motors (via resolvers<br>
150 and 155) and transmit an error message when motor 110 or 160 are<br>
malfunctioning, respectively.<br><br>
5<br>
[0020] When malfunctioning, motor 110 and 160 may exhibit at least one of<br>
multiple possible fault conditions. One fault condition occurs when motors<br>
110 and 160 are rotating too fast. This fault condition is referred to as a "loss<br>
of tracking" condition. A loss of tracking condition is detected by resolver<br>
decoders 1250 and 1275 when the frequency of the signals transmitted from<br>
resolver 105 and/or 155 is greater than a pre-determined threshold frequency<br>
of the signals or the resolver signal shows an exceedingly large rotational<br>
acceleration.<br>
[0021] A "degraded signal" is another fault condition that may occur in<br>
motors 110 and 160. A degraded signal condition is detected by resolver<br>
decoders 1250 and 1275 when the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of the<br>
signals transmitted from resolvers 105 and 155 are greater than a pre-<br>
determined threshold voltage. Since each resolver typically includes two sine<br>
wave feedback outputs and two cosine feedback outputs, the degraded signal<br>
may be found from either the sine or cosine feedback signals. Additionally, if<br>
the difference between the peak-to-peak voltage amplitudes of the sine and<br>
cosine signals is greater than a pre-determined value, the degraded signal fault<br>
may be logged by the corresponding resolver decoder.<br>
[0022] Another fault condition that may be experienced by motors 110 and<br>
160 is a "loss of signal" condition. A loss of signal fault condition is detected<br>
by resolver decoders 1250 and 1275 when the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude<br>
of the signals transmitted from resolvers 105 and/or 155 are less than a pre-<br>
determined threshold. Since each resolver typically includes sine wave<br>
feedback outputs and cosine feedback outputs, the loss of signal fault<br>
conditions for each resolver may be caused by the loss of signal strength in<br>
any of the feedback outputs, the extreme case being an open circuit in one or<br>
more resolver wire connections.<br><br>
6<br>
[0023] A "DC bias Out-Of-Range (OOR)" condition is another fault<br>
condition that may be experienced by resolvers 105 and 155. A DC bias OOR<br>
fault condition is detected when the DC bias of the signals output by the pair<br>
of sine wave feedback outputs and/or the pair of cosine wave feedback outputs<br>
is either too high or too low. A short circuit condition to the power supply or<br>
circuit ground is a typical DC bias OOR fault condition that may be<br>
experienced by resolvers 105 and 155.<br>
[0024] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
device 200 for diagnosing faults in system 10. Device 200 may be inserted in,<br>
for example, a wire harness (not shown) between resolvers 105/155 and motor<br>
controller 120. Device 200 includes a connector 202, a connector 204, a<br>
connector 206, and a connector 208 to detachably couple device 200 to system<br>
10. That is, connector 202 is configured to couple resolver 105 to device 200,<br>
connector 204 is configured to couple resolver 155 to device 200, connector<br>
206 is configured to couple resolver decoder 1250 to device 200, and<br>
connector 208 is configured to couple resolver decoder 1275 to device 200.<br>
[0025] Device 200 also includes a swapping circuit 210 coupled to a<br>
swapping circuit 220. Swapping circuit 210 is configured to selectively switch<br>
between being coupled to a resolver simulator 300 {see FIG. 3) and connector<br>
202. Swapping circuit 220 is configured to selectively switch between being<br>
coupled to connector 206 and connector 208. Accordingly, resolver simulator<br>
300 or connector 202 may be coupled to either connector 206 or connector<br>
208. Similarly, connector 206 or connector 208 may be coupled to either<br>
resolver simulator 300 or connector 202.<br>
[0026] Device 200 also includes a swapping circuit 230 coupled to a<br>
swapping circuit 240. Swapping circuit 230 is configured to selectively switch<br>
between being coupled to resolver simulator 300 or connector 204. Swapping<br>
circuit 240 is configured to selectively switch between being coupled to<br>
connector 206 or connector 208.    Accordingly, resolver simulator 300 or<br><br>
7<br>
connector 204 may be coupled to either connector 206 or connector 208.<br>
Similarly, connector 206 or connector 208 may be coupled to either resolver<br>
simulator 300 or connector 204.<br>
[0027] A controller 250 coupled to swapping circuits 210, 220, 230, and<br>
240 is also included in device 200. Controller 250 is also coupled to a<br>
connector 255 configured to detachably couple device 200 to motor controller<br>
120.<br>
[0028] Controller 250 is configured to operate in a plurality of modes (e.g., a<br>
run/crank mode, an accessory mode, etc.) to test (discussed below) motor 110<br>
(via resolver 105), motor 160 (via resolver 155), resolver decoder 1250, and/or<br>
resolver decoder 1275. The accessory mode enables device 200 to "swap"<br>
between the various components of device 200. That is, controller 250 is<br>
configured to transmit a signal to swapping circuit 210, 220, 230, and/or 240<br>
instructing one or more of these swapping circuits to switch from being<br>
coupled to one component, to being coupled to another component. For<br>
example, controller 250 may transmit a signal to swapping circuit 210 (when<br>
the vehicle key is in the accessory position, but not in the run/crank position)<br>
instructing swapping circuit 220 to switch from being coupled to connector<br>
206 (i.e., resolver decoder 1250) to being coupled to connector 208 (i.e.,<br>
resolver decoder 1275). Controller 250 may, at substantially the same time,<br>
instruct swapping circuit 230 to switch from being coupled to connector 204<br>
(i.e., resolver 155) to being coupled to resolver simulator 300. As one skilled<br>
in the art will appreciate, controller 250 is able to transmit signals to swapping<br>
circuit 210, 220, 230, and/or 240 to enable any combination of resolver<br>
simulator 300, resolver 105, or resolver 155 to be coupled to resolver decoder<br>
1250 or resolver decoder 1275 when operating in accessory mode.<br><br>
8<br>
[0029] In addition, controller 250 is configured to couple resolver simulator<br>
300 to resolver decoder 1250 (via swapping circuits 210 and 220) and resolver<br>
decoder 1275 (via swapping circuits 230 and 240) at the same time. Here,<br>
resolver simulator 300 is capable of simulating both resolver 105 and resolver<br>
155 to test resolver decoders 1250 and 1275 at the same time. That is,<br>
controller 250 may couple resolver 105 and resolver 155 to a respective one of<br>
resolver decoders 1250 and 1275, and then switch the coupling (via swapping<br>
circuits 220 and 240) of resolver 105 and resolver 155 to the other one of<br>
resolver decoders 1250 and 1275.<br>
[0030] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of one exemplary embodiment of<br>
resolver simulator 300 {see FIG. 2). Resolver simulator 300 includes an<br>
adjustable waveform generator 310 configured to generate waveforms (e.g.,<br>
square waves) representing an output of a motor (e.g., motor 110 or 160).<br>
Moreover, the frequency of the signals generated by waveform generator 310<br>
may be adjusted to simulate a "loss of tracking" fault condition of a motor<br>
(i.e., the motor is rotating too fast) or normal speeds of a motor. The output of<br>
waveform generator 310 is coupled to a sine wave circuit 320 and to a cosine<br>
wave circuit 330.<br>
[0031] Sine wave circuit 320 is configured to simulate a pair of sine wave<br>
feedback outputs of resolvers 105 and 155. To accomplish this, sine wave<br>
circuit 320 includes a low pass filter 3205 having an output coupled to a gain<br>
adjustment circuit 3310. Low pass filter 3205 and gain adjustment circuit<br>
3310 operate to transform the square waves generated by waveform generator<br>
310 into sine waves.<br>
[0032] Also included in sine wave circuit 320 is a switch 3215 (e.g., a single<br>
pole, double throw (SPDT) switch) to selectively couple gain adjustment<br>
circuit 3210 or a reference voltage 340 (discussed below) to a buffer 3320.<br>
Sine wave circuit 320 also includes a signal multiplier circuit 3225 coupled to<br>
the output of buffer 3220.   The output of signal multiplier circuit 3225 is<br><br>
9<br>
coupled to an adder 3230, and adder 3230 is coupled to an adjustable DC<br>
offset circuit 3235.   DC offset circuit 3235 is configured to adjustably (either<br>
automatically  and/or  manually  via,  for  example,  a  potentiometer  3237)<br>
increase or decrease the DC bias of the sine waves generated by sine wave<br>
circuit  320 to  simulate  a  short circuit condition  or a non-short circuit<br>
condition.<br>
[0033]    The output of adder 3230 is coupled to a buffer 3248 and to a phase<br>
shift circuit 3254. Buffer 3248 is configured to the amplify signals received<br>
from adder 3230, and the output of buffer 3248 is coupled to an output 3240 of<br>
sine wave circuit 320.<br>
[0034]    Phase shift circuit 3254 is configured to shift the phase of the signals<br>
received from adder 3230 by 180°, and the output of phase shift circuit 3254 is<br>
coupled to another output 3250 of sine wave circuit 320.<br>
[0035]     Cosine wave circuit 330 is configured to simulate a pair of cosine<br>
wave feedback outputs of resolvers 105 and 155.   Cosine wave circuit 330<br>
includes an output of a low pass filter 3305 coupled to a phase shift circuit<br>
3307.   The output of phase shift circuit 3307 is coupled to a gain adjustment<br>
circuit 3310.     Low pass filter 3305, phase shift circuit 3307,  and gain<br>
adjustment circuit 3310 operate to transform the square waves generated by<br>
waveform generator 310 into sine waves (via low pass filter 3305) and then<br>
into cosine waves (via phase shift circuit 3307).<br>
[0036]    Also included in cosine wave circuit 330 is a switch 3315 (e.g., a<br>
single pole, double throw (SPDT) switch) to selectively couple the output of<br>
gain adjustment circuit 3310 or a reference voltage 340 (discussed below) to a<br>
buffer 3320.<br>
[0037]    Cosine wave circuit 330 also includes a signal multiplier circuit 3325<br>
having an input coupled to buffer 3320. The output of signal multiplier circuit<br>
3325 is coupled to an adder 3330, and adder 3330 is also coupled to an<br>
adjustable DC offset circuit 3335.   DC offset circuit 3335 is configured to<br><br>
10<br>
adjustably (either automatically and/or manually via, for example, a<br>
potentiometer 3337) increase or decrease the DC bias of the cosine waves<br>
generated by cosine wave circuit 330 to simulate a short circuit condition or a<br>
non-short circuit condition.<br>
[0038] The output of adder 3330 is coupled to a buffer 3348 and coupled to<br>
a phase shift circuit 3354. Buffer 3348 is configured to the amplify signals<br>
received from adder 3330, and the output of buffer 3348 is coupled to an<br>
output 3340 of cosine wave circuit 330.<br>
[0039] Phase shift circuit 3354 is configured to shift the phase of the signals<br>
received from adder 3330 by 180°, and the output of phase shift circuit 3354 is<br>
coupled to another output 3350 of cosine wave circuit 330.<br>
[0040] As discussed above, resolver simulator 300 includes a reference<br>
voltage 340 selectively coupled to buffer 3220 and buffer 3320 via switches<br>
3215 and 3315, respectively. Reference voltage 340 operates to simulate a<br>
motor at rest (i.e., rotating at zero RPMs). Because of reference voltage 340<br>
and waveform generator 310, resolver simulator 300 is capable of simulating<br>
motor speeds from zero RPMs to speeds greater than, for example, 13,000<br>
RPMs. This enables resolver simulator 300 to simulate the range of speeds of<br>
motor-resolver systems 100 and 150 (see FIG. 1).<br>
[0041] Resolver simulator 300 also includes a gain circuit 350 coupled to<br>
signal multiplier circuit 3225 and coupled to signal multiplier circuit 3325.<br>
Gain circuit 350 is configured to adjust (automatically and/or manually) the<br>
voltage amplitudes of the sine waves produced by sine wave circuit 320 and<br>
the cosine waves produced by cosine wave circuit 330. That is, gain circuit<br>
350 is capable of adjusting the peak-to-peak voltage amplitudes of the sine<br>
waves and/or the cosine waves to simulate degraded signal fault conditions<br>
and/or loss of signal fault conditions depending upon whether the peak-to-<br>
peak amplitudes are greater than a maximum threshold voltage amplitude or<br>
less than a minimum threshold voltage amplitude.  Moreover, gain circuit 350<br><br>
11<br>
is capable of manipulating the peak-to-peak voltage amplitudes of the sine<br>
waves and/or the cosine waves to simulate a "properly functioning" signal.<br>
[0042] To accomplish such, gain circuit 350 includes a buffer 3510 coupled<br>
to signal multiplier circuits 3225 and 3325 discussed above. Gain circuit 350<br>
also includes buffer 3510 coupled to a differential amplifier 3520. Moreover,<br>
differential amplifier 3520 includes a positive excitation input 3524 and a<br>
negative excitation input 3528 of resolver decoders 105 and 155 (see FIG. 1).<br>
[0043] Resolver simulator 300 also includes a resolver decoder 360 for self-<br>
calibrating resolver simulator 300 prior to testing a motor controller (e.g.,<br>
motor controller 120). Resolver decoder 360 is configured to be substantially<br>
similar to resolver decoders 1250 and 1275 (see FIG. 1). To self-calibrate<br>
resolver simulator 300, waveform generator 310, DC offset circuit 3235, DC<br>
offset circuit 3335, and gain circuit 350 are each adjusted so that resolver<br>
simulator 300 does not produce one or more fault conditions. That is, resolver<br>
simulator 300 outputs signals from sine wave circuit 320 and cosine wave<br>
circuit 330 to resolver decoder 360 representing a correctly functioning motor.<br>
Because resolver decoder 360 is substantially similar to resolver decoders<br>
1250 and 1275, resolver simulator 300 is also calibrated for motor controller<br>
120.<br>
[0044] As illustrated in FIG. 3, sine wave output 3240 is selectively coupled<br>
to the input of resolver decoder 360 or one resolver decoder (e.g., resolver<br>
decoders 1250 and 1275) of motor controller 120 via a switch 365 (e.g., an<br>
SPDT switch). Similarly, sine wave output 3250 is selectively coupled to the<br>
input of resolver decoder 360 or to one resolver decoder of motor controller<br>
120 via a switch 370 (e.g., an SPDT switch).<br>
[0045] Cosine wave output 3340 is selectively coupled to the input of<br>
resolver decoder 360 or to one resolver decoder of motor controller 120 via a<br>
switch 375 (e.g., an SPDT switch). Furthermore, cosine wave output 3350 is<br>
selectively coupled to the input of resolver decoder 360 or to one resolver<br><br>
12<br>
decoder of motor controller 120 via a switch 380 (e.g., an SPDT switch). That<br>
is, sine wave output 3240, sine wave output 3250, cosine wave output 3340,<br>
and cosine wave output 3350 are coupled to the input of resolver decoder 360<br>
when resolver simulator 300 is being self-calibrated, and coupled to either<br>
resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 when resolver simulator 300 is testing resolver<br>
decoder 1250 or 1275, respectively.<br>
[0046] In addition, positive excitation input 3524 is selectively coupled to<br>
the output of resolver decoder 360 or the output of one resolver decoder of<br>
motor controller 120 via a switch 385 (e.g., an SPDT switch). Negative<br>
excitation input 3528 is selectively coupled to the output of resolver decoder<br>
360 or the output of one resolver decoder of motor controller 120 via a switch<br>
390 (e.g., an SPDT switch). That is, positive excitation input 3524 and<br>
negative excitation input 3528 are coupled to the output of resolver decoder<br>
360 when resolver simulator 300 is being self-calibrated, and coupled to the<br>
output of either resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 when resolver simulator 300 is<br>
testing resolver decoder 1250 or 1275, respectively.<br>
[0047| During an exemplary operational mode, various inputs to resolver<br>
simulator 300 may be manually and/or automatically adjusted to simulate one<br>
or more of the fault conditions discussed above or a properly operating<br>
condition to determine if the motor controller (e.g., motor controller 120) is<br>
functioning properly. For example, the frequency of signals produced by<br>
waveform generator 310 may be increased so that the outputs of sine wave<br>
output 3240, sine wave output 3250, cosine wave output 3340, and/or cosine<br>
wave output 3350 simulate a loss of tracking fault condition. In another<br>
example, the DC bias of the outputs of sine wave output 3240 and sine wave<br>
output 3250, and/or cosine wave output 3340 and cosine wave output 3350<br>
may be adjusted to be too high or too low to simulate a short circuit fault<br>
condition. Furthermore, the voltage gain produced by gain circuit 350 may be<br>
increased or decreased so that the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of the<br><br>
13<br>
outputs of sine wave output 3240, sine wave output 3250, cosine wave output<br>
3340, and/or cosine wave output 3350 are less than or greater than a pre-<br>
determined threshold to simulate a loss of signal or degraded signal fault<br>
condition, respectively. In addition, the outputs may include a frequency, DC<br>
bias, and peak-to-peak voltage simulating a properly functioning motor-<br>
resolver system. Accordingly, resolver simulator 300 is capable of simulating<br>
the multiple fault conditions discussed above with reference to motor-resolver<br>
systems 100 and 150, as well as a properly functioning motor-resolver system.<br>
[0048] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram representing one exemplary embodiment of<br>
a method 400 for testing system 10. After system 10 is coupled to device 200<br>
(e.g., resolver 105 is coupled to connector 202, resolver 155 is coupled to<br>
connector 204, resolver decoder 1250 is coupled to connector 206, and<br>
resolver decoder 1275 is coupled to connector 208), resolver 105 is coupled to<br>
resolver decoder 1250 via, for example, swapping circuits 210 and 220. A<br>
signal from resolver 105 is transmitted to resolver decoder 1250 (step 405) to<br>
determine if motor controller 120 transmits an error message in response to the<br>
signal from resolver 105 (step 410).<br>
[0049] Resolver 155 is coupled to resolver decoder 1275 via, for example,<br>
swapping circuits 230 and 240. A signal from resolver 155 is transmitted to<br>
resolver decoder 1275 (step 415) to determine if motor controller 120<br>
transmits an error message in response to the signal from resolver 155 (step<br>
420).<br>
[0050] Resolver 105 is also coupled to resolver decoder 1275 via, for<br>
example, swapping circuits 210 and 220. A signal from resolver 105 is<br>
transmitted to resolver decoder 1275 (step 425) to determine if motor<br>
controller 120 transmits an error message in response to the signal from<br>
resolver 105 (step 430). Similarly, resolver 155 is also coupled to resolver<br>
decoder 1250 via, for example, swapping circuits 230 and 240. A signal from<br>
resolver 155 is transmitted to resolver decoder 1250 (step 435) to determine if<br><br>
14<br>
motor controller 120 transmits an error message in response to the signal from<br>
resolver 155 (step 440).<br>
[0051] Once steps 405 through 440 have been performed, it can be<br>
determined which of resolver 105, resolver 155, resolver decoder 1250,<br>
resolver decoder 1275, and/or an input/output (I/O) or software of motor<br>
controller 120 is malfunctioning (step 445). Resolver 105 and/or 155 is<br>
malfunctioning if motor controller 120 transmits an error message that<br>
"jumps" from one decoder to the other decoder when motor controller 120<br>
receives signals from resolver 105 or 155, respectively. For example, if motor<br>
controller 120 transmits an error message when resolver decoder 1250 is<br>
receiving signals from resolver 105 (via swapping circuits 210 and 220), and<br>
also transmits an error message when resolver decoder 1275 is receiving<br>
signals from resolver 105 (after swapping circuit 220 connects to resolver<br>
decoder 1275), resolver 105 is malfunctioning. In another example, if motor<br>
controller 120 transmits an error message when resolver decoder 1275 is<br>
receiving signals from resolver 155 (via swapping circuits 230 and 240), and<br>
also transmits an error message when resolver decoder 1250 is receiving<br>
signals from resolver 155 (after swapping circuit 240 connects to resolver<br>
decoder 1275), resolver 155 is malfunctioning.<br>
[0052] Resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 (or an I/O or software of motor<br>
controller 120) is malfunctioning if motor controller 120 transmits an error<br>
message that fails to "jump" from one resolver decoder to the other resolver<br>
decoder when resolver decoders 1250 and 1275 receive signals from resolvers<br>
105 and 155, respectively. For example, if motor controller 120 transmits an<br>
error message when resolver decoder 1250 is receiving signals from resolver<br>
105 (via swapping circuits 210 and 220), and continues to transmit an error<br>
message when resolver decoder 1250 is receiving signals from resolver 155<br>
(via swapping circuits 230 and 240), resolver decoder 1250 is malfunctioning.<br>
Likewise, if motor controller 120 transmits an error message when resolver<br><br>
15<br>
decoder 1275 is receiving signals from resolver 105 (via swapping circuits 210<br>
and 220), and continues to transmit an error message when resolver decoder<br>
1275 is receiving signals from resolver 155 (via swapping circuits 230 and<br>
240), resolver decoder 1275 is malfunctioning. If resolver 105, resolver 155,<br>
resolver decoder 1250, and resolver decoder 1275 are each functioning<br>
properly, but motor controller 120 continues to transmit an error signal, an I/O<br>
or the software of motor controller 120 is malfunctioning.<br>
[0053] When resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is malfunctioning, the type of<br>
malfunction resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing can be determined<br>
(step 450). That is, resolver simulator 300 (and swapping circuits 210 and<br>
230, as controlled by controller 250) may be used to identify which faulty<br>
condition(s) resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing.<br>
[0054] To determine if the malfunction resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is<br>
experiencing is associated with detection of a loss of tracking fault condition,<br>
resolver simulator 300 (after being coupled to resolver decoder 1250 or 1275)<br>
transmits one or more signals simulating a motor rate of speed. The speed<br>
may then be increased (either instantaneously or gradually) to simulate an<br>
acceleration that is too large or a rate of speed greater than a maximum<br>
threshold speed to determine if motor controller transmits an error message in<br>
response thereto. If motor controller 120 transmits an error message in<br>
response to the simulated speed being greater than the maximum threshold<br>
speed, resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is not experiencing a malfunction<br>
associated with detecting a loss of tracking fault condition. Alternatively, if<br>
motor controller 120 fails to transmit an error message in response to the<br>
simulated speed being greater than the maximum threshold speed, resolver<br>
decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing a malfunction associated with detecting<br>
a loss of tracking fault condition.<br><br>
16<br>
[0055] In determining if the malfunction resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is<br>
experiencing is associated with detection of a degraded signal fault condition,<br>
resolver simulator 300 transmits one or more signals simulating a resolver<br>
peak-to-peak voltage amplitude. The voltage of the simulated signals may<br>
initially simulate a properly functioning resolver. The voltage may then be<br>
increased (either instantaneously or gradually) to simulate a peak-to-peak<br>
voltage greater than a maximum threshold voltage to determine if motor<br>
controller transmits an error message in response to the simulated voltage<br>
being greater than the maximum threshold voltage. If motor controller 120<br>
transmits an error message in response to the simulated voltage being greater<br>
than the maximum threshold voltage, resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is not<br>
experiencing a malfunction associated with detecting a degraded signal fault<br>
condition. Alternatively, if motor controller 120 fails to transmit an error<br>
message in response to the simulated voltage being greater than the maximum<br>
threshold voltage, resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing a<br>
malfunction associated with detecting a degraded signal fault condition.<br>
[0056] To determine if the malfunction resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is<br>
experiencing is associated with detection of a loss of signal fault condition,<br>
resolver simulator 300 transmits one or more signals simulating a resolver<br>
peak-to-peak voltage amplitude. The voltage of the simulated signals may<br>
initially be within the range of voltages simulating a properly functioning<br>
resolver. The voltage may then be decreased (either instantaneously or<br>
gradually) to simulate a peak-to-peak voltage less than a minimum threshold<br>
voltage to determine if motor controller transmits an error message in response<br>
to the simulated voltage being less than the minimum threshold voltage. If<br>
motor controller 120 transmits an error message in response to the simulated<br>
voltage being less than the minimum threshold voltage, resolver decoder 1250<br>
or 1275 is not experiencing a malfunction associated with detecting a loss of<br>
signal fault condition.   Alternatively, if motor controller 120 fails to transmit<br><br>
17<br>
an error message in response to the simulated voltage being less than the<br>
minimum threshold voltage, resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing a<br>
malfunction associated with detecting a loss of signal fault condition.<br>
[0057] In determining if the malfunction resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is<br>
experiencing is associated with detection of a DC bias OOR fault condition,<br>
resolver simulator 300 transmits one or more signals simulating a resolver DC<br>
bias. The DC bias of the simulated signals may initially be within a range of<br>
DC biases simulating a properly functioning resolver. The DC bias may then<br>
be increased (either instantaneously or gradually) and/or decreased (either<br>
instantaneously or gradually) to simulate a DC bias that is either greater than a<br>
maximum threshold DC bias or a DC bias that is below a minimum threshold<br>
DC bias to determine if motor controller transmits an error message in<br>
response thereto. If motor controller 120 transmits an error message in<br>
response to the simulated DC bias being greater than the maximum threshold<br>
DC bias and/or (depending upon whether testing one of or both of the<br>
maximum and minimum DC bias threshold(s)) being less than the minimum<br>
threshold DC bias, resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is not experiencing a<br>
malfunction associated with detecting a DC bias OOR fault condition.<br>
Alternatively, if motor controller 120 fails to transmit an error message in<br>
response to the simulated DC bias being greater than the maximum threshold<br>
DC bias and/or (depending upon whether testing one of or both of the<br>
maximum and minimum DC bias threshold(s)) being less than the minimum<br>
threshold DC bias, resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing a<br>
malfunction associated with detecting a DC bias OOR fault condition.<br>
[0058] After the type of malfunction is determined, the magnitude of the<br>
malfunction can be quantified (step 455). The magnitude of the malfunction<br>
may be quantified by determining a threshold motor speed (for a loss of<br>
tracking fault condition), a threshold peak-to-peak voltage (for a loss of signal<br><br>
18<br>
fault condition or a degraded signal condition), or a DC bias threshold (for a<br>
DC bias OOR fault condition).<br>
[0059] The threshold motor speed is the motor speed at which motor<br>
controller 120 transmits the error message in response to signals from resolver<br>
simulator 300. To determine the threshold motor speed when a loss of<br>
tracking fault condition exists, waveform generator 310 (see FIG. 3) may be<br>
adjusted (either gradually or instantaneously) so that resolver simulator 300<br>
outputs signals simulating varying motor speeds until motor controller 120<br>
transmits the error signal. The simulated motor speed may be started at a<br>
speed representing a properly functioning resolver signal or a speed<br>
representing the loss of tracking fault condition. The threshold motor speed<br>
may then be compared to the motor speed at which motor controller 120<br>
should transmit the error message to quantify the loss of tracking fault<br>
condition.<br>
[0060] The threshold peak-to-peak voltage is the voltage at which at which<br>
motor controller 120 transmits the error message in response to signals from<br>
resolver simulator 300. In determining the threshold peak-to-peak voltage<br>
when a degraded signal fault condition exists, gain circuit 350 (see FIG. 3)<br>
may be adjusted (either gradually or instantaneously) so that resolver<br>
simulator 300 outputs signals simulating varying peak-to-peak voltages until<br>
motor controller 120 transmits the error signal. The simulated peak-to-peak<br>
voltages may be started at a voltage representing a properly functioning<br>
resolver signal or a voltage representing the degraded signal fault condition.<br>
The threshold voltage may then be compared to the voltage at which motor<br>
controller 120 should transmit the error message to quantify the degraded<br>
signal fault condition. Similarly, gain circuit 350 may be adjusted (either<br>
gradually or instantaneously) so that resolver simulator 300 outputs signals<br>
simulating varying peak-to-peak voltages to determine the threshold peak-to-<br>
peak voltage when a loss of signal fault condition exists.<br><br>
19<br>
[0061] The threshold DC bias is the DC bias at which at which motor<br>
controller 120 transmits the error message in response to signals from resolver<br>
simulator 300. In determining the threshold DC bias when a DC bias OOR<br>
fault condition exists, DC offset circuit 3235 and/or DC offset circuit 3335<br>
(see FIG. 3) may be adjusted (either gradually or instantaneously) so that<br>
resolver simulator 300 outputs signals simulating varying DC biases until<br>
motor controller 120 transmits the error signal. The simulated DC biases may<br>
be started at a DC bias representing a properly functioning resolver signal or a<br>
DC bias representing the short circuit fault condition. The threshold DC bias<br>
may then be compared to the DC bias at which motor controller 120 should<br>
transmit the error message to quantify the short circuit fault condition.<br>
[0062] Sometimes when a malfunction exists in system 10, which of motor-<br>
resolver systems 100 and 150 has the problem is known. However, whether<br>
the malfunction is on the motor side or the motor controller side is unknown.<br>
For example, if a malfunction exists in system 10, it may be known that the<br>
malfunction is within motor-resolver system 100, however; whether resolver<br>
105 or resolver decoder 1250 is the malfunctioning component is unknown.<br>
In another example, if a malfunction exists in system 10, it may be known that<br>
the malfunction is within motor-resolver system 150, however; whether<br>
resolver 155 or resolver decoder 1275 is the malfunctioning component is<br>
unknown.<br>
[0063] FIG. 5 is a flow diagram representing one exemplary embodiment of<br>
a method 500 for diagnosing faults in system 10 when it is known that the<br>
malfunction is in motor-resolver system 100 or motor-resolver system 150.<br>
Method 500 begins by coupling a resolver (e.g., resolver 105) to a resolver<br>
decoder (e.g., resolver decoder 1275) (step 505), and coupling another resolver<br>
(e.g., resolver 155) to another resolver decoder (e.g., resolver decoder 1250)<br>
(step 510). A signal is transmitted from resolver 105 to resolver decoder 1275<br>
(step 515) to determine if the motor controller (e.g., motor controller 120)<br><br>
20<br>
transmits an error message (step 520). A signal is also transmitted from<br>
resolver 155 to resolver decoder 1250 (step 525) to determine motor controller<br>
120 transmits an error message (step 530).<br>
[0064] Once steps 505 through 525 have been performed, which motor<br>
controller or resolver decoder is malfunctioning can be determined (step 535).<br>
If the error message transmitted by motor controller 120 "jumps" from one<br>
resolver decoder to the other resolver decoder, the motor is malfunctioning. If<br>
the error message fails to jump from one resolver decoder to the other resolver<br>
decoder (i.e., stays at the same resolver decoder), the resolver decoder is<br>
malfunctioning. For example, if it is known that motor-resolver system 100 is<br>
malfunctioning, after resolver 105 transmits a signal to resolver decoder 1275<br>
and resolver 155 transmits a signal to resolver decoder 1250, if controller 120<br>
transmits the error message from resolver decoder 1275, resolver 105 is<br>
malfunctioning. If controller 120 transmits the error message from resolver<br>
decoder 1250, resolver decoder 1250 is malfunctioning. In an example when<br>
it is known that motor-resolver system 150 is malfunctioning, if controller 120<br>
transmits the error message from resolver decoder 1250, resolver 155 is<br>
malfunctioning; but if controller 120 transmits the error message from resolver<br>
decoder 1275, resolver decoder 1275 is malfunctioning.<br>
[0065] When resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is malfunctioning, which of the<br>
multiple fault conditions resolver decoder 1250 or 1275 is experiencing can be<br>
determined in a manner similar to step 450 discussed above with respect to<br>
FIG. 4 (step 540). Furthermore, once the type of fault condition is determined,<br>
the magnitude of the fault condition(s) can be determined in a manner similar<br>
to step 455 discussed above with respect to FIG. 4 (step 545).<br><br>
21<br>
[0066] FIG. 6 is a flow diagram representing one exemplary embodiment of<br>
a method 600 for diagnosing faults in system 10. Method 600 begins by<br>
knowing that a motor controller (e.g., motor controller 120) indicates that side<br>
A (e.g., motor-resolver system 100 in FIG. 1) and side B (e.g., motor-resolver<br>
system 150 in FIG. 1) of system 10 are malfunctioning (i.e., are "bad") (step<br>
605).<br>
[0067] Method 600 also includes connecting system 10 to device 200 and<br>
swapping (via swapping circuits 220 and 240) the coupling of sides A and B<br>
(step 610). That is, for example, coupling resolver 105 to decoder resolver<br>
1275 and coupling resolver 155 to resolver decoder 1250 when resolver 105<br>
was initially coupled to resolver decoder 1250 and resolver 155 was initially<br>
coupled to resolver decoder 1275.<br>
[0068] Side A is checked to determine if it is functioning properly (i.e., if it<br>
is "good") and side B is checked to determine if it is malfunctioning or bad<br>
(step 615). If side A is functioning properly and side B is malfunctioning,<br>
decoder A (e.g., resolver decoder 1250) and resolver B (e.g., resolver 155) are<br>
determined to be functioning properly (i.e., are "good") (step 620), and<br>
decoder B (e.g., resolver decoder 1275) and resolver A (e.g., resolver 105) are<br>
determined to be malfunctioning (i.e., are "bad") (step 625).<br>
[0069] Side A is checked to determine if it is malfunctioning and side B is<br>
checked to determine if it is functioning properly (step 630). If side A is<br>
malfunctioning and side B is functioning properly, decoder B (e.g., resolver<br>
decoder 1275) and resolver A (e.g., resolver 105) are determined to be<br>
functioning properly (i.e., are "good") (step 635), and decoder A (e.g., resolver<br>
decoder 1250) and resolver B (e.g., resolver 155) are determined to be<br>
malfunctioning (i.e., are "bad") (step 640).<br>
[0070] If the answer to both steps 615 and 630 are NO, it is determined that<br>
resolvers A and B, or decoders A and B are both malfunctioning (step 645).<br>
In this situation, a resolver simulator (e.g., resolver simulator 300) is used to<br><br>
22<br>
check decoders A and B (step 650) to determine if decoders A and B are both<br>
functioning properly (step 655). If decoders A and B are functioning properly,<br>
resolvers A and B are both malfunctioning (step 660); otherwise, decoders A<br>
and B are both malfunctioning (step 665).<br>
[0071] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the<br>
foregoing detailed description of the invention, it should be appreciated that a<br>
vast number of variations exist and that the method steps described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 4 and 5 may be performed in any order and/or one or more<br>
steps may be omitted. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in<br>
any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled<br>
in the art with a convenient road map for implementing an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention, it being understood that various changes may be<br>
made in the function and arrangement of elements described in an exemplary<br>
embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in<br>
the appended claims and their legal equivalents.<br><br>
