				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a multilayer structure comprising a layer made from a<br>
barrier polymer and a polyolefin layer that may take the form of a film, pipe,<br>
tube, container or tank. In the case of a pipe, tube, container or tank, it may be<br>
used to transfer fluids such as a fuel (e.g. a fuel). The barrier polymer may be<br>
impact-modified.<br>
The Technical Problem<br>
Polyolefins are often used for manufacturing structures such as pipes, tubes or<br>
containers, but for many uses they have barrier properties, for example towards<br>
a fuel, that are often very inadequate. This is why it is common to combine a<br>
polyolefin layer with a layer of a barrier polymer such as EVOH. The polyolefin<br>
has a tendency to swell when in contact with a fuel (whether this is in contact<br>
with the innermost or outermost layer), which tends to affect the mechanical<br>
properties of the structure and also its dimensional stability. The structure must<br>
also have low temperature impact strength and retain good mechanical<br>
properties at high temperatures.<br>
The Applicant has developed a multilayer structure that solves the problems<br>
posed, that is to say in particular that it:<br>
-	has good low temperature strength;<br>
-	retains good mechanical properties at high temperatures;<br>
-	has a low permeability to fuel; and<br>
-	retains these properties even in contact with fuel.<br>
The Prior Art<br>
Applications EP 1 537 989 and EP 1 541 343 describe a multilayer structure<br>
based on a fluoropolymer onto which an unsaturated monomer has been<br>
radiation-grafted. The pipe comprises a modified fluoropolymer layer and a<br>
polyolefin layer. There is no mention of EVOH.<br><br>
Application EP 1 637 319 describes a multilayer structure comprising a barrier<br>
polymer layer and a tie layer comprising a polyethylene bearing epoxy<br>
functional groups and a viscous polymer. The barrier polymer may be a PVDF<br>
onto which an unsaturated monomer has been radiation-grafted. There is no<br>
mention of EVOH.<br>
International Application WO 2005/018927 describes a flexible pipe comprising<br>
an inner fluoropolymer layer, an intermediate layer made from a thermoplastic<br>
polymer such as, for example PE or PA and an outer fluoropolymer layer. An<br>
adhesive tie layer may be placed between the fluoropolymer layer or layers and<br>
the thermoplastic polymer layer.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a multilayer structure comprising a layer of a barrier<br>
polymer, that is optionally impact-modified, and a polyolefin layer.<br>
It may be in film, pipe, tube, container or tank form. In the case of a pipe, tube,<br>
container or tank, thanks to its barrier properties, it may be used to store or<br>
transfer a fuel.<br>
More precisely, the invention concerns a multilayer structure comprising (from<br>
the inside towards the outside):<br>
•	a layer C1 comprising at least one functionalized fluoropolymer,<br>
optionally blended with at least one compatible fluoropolymer;<br>
•	a layer C2 comprising at least one adhesive tie;<br>
•	a layer C3 comprising at least one polyolefin, preferably a<br>
polyethylene;<br>
•	a layer C4 comprising at least one adhesive tie; and<br>
•	a barrier layer C5 comprising at least one barrier polymer, optionally<br>
impact-modified,<br>
the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Regarding the polyolefin, this is a polyethylene or a polypropylene. The term<br>
polyethylene encompasses ethylene homopolymers and copolymers. It may be,<br>
for example, an HDPE, an LLDPE or an LDPE. It could also be a polyethylene<br>
obtained by a single-site catalysis (for example of metallocene type), for<br>
example an ethylene-octene copolymer of the ENGAGE®type.<br>
The term polypropylene encompasses propylene homopolymers and<br>
copolymers. It may be an isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylene. The term<br>
polyolefin also encompasses EPR (Ethylene-Propylene Rubber) or EPDM<br>
(Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer) type copolymers.<br>
Preferably, a PE 100 type polyethylene will be chosen for the polyolefin, that is<br>
to say a PE which, when it is in the form of a pipe with specific dimensions<br>
withstands a test pressure for a period of 5000 hours under vacuum (see<br>
standards ISO 1167, ISO 9080 and ISO 12162). A definition of PE 100 can also<br>
be found in the International Application WO 2000/060001. This type of PE has<br>
indeed a good mechanical strength and a low tendency to swell in the presence<br>
of fuel, especially fuel.<br>
Regarding the fluoropolymer, this denotes any polymer having in its chain<br>
more than 50%, preferably more than 75%, by weight of at least one<br>
fluoromonomer chosen from the compounds containing a vinyl group capable of<br>
opening in order to be polymerized and that contains, directly attached to this<br>
vinyl group, at least one fluorine atom, one fluoroalkyl group or one fluoroalkoxy<br>
group.<br>
As examples of the fluoromonomer, mention may be made of: vinyl fluoride;<br>
vinylidene fluoride (VDF, CH2=CF2); trifluoroethylene (VF3);<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE); 1,2-difluoroethylene; tetrafluoroethylene (TFE);<br>
hexafluoropropylene (HFP); perfluoro(alkyl vinyl) ethers such as<br>
perfluoro(methyl vinyl) ether (PMVE), perfluoro(ethyl vinyl) ether (PEVE) and<br><br>
perfluoro(propyl vinyl) ether (PPVE); perfluoro-1,3-dioxole; perfluoro-2,2-<br>
dimethyl-1,3-dioxole	(PDD);	the	product	of	formula<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)OCF2CF2X in which X is SO2F, C02H, CH2OH, CH2OCN<br>
or CH2OPO3H; the product of formula CF2=CFOCF2CF2SO2F; the product of<br>
formula F(CF2)nCH2OCF=CF2 in which n is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; the product of formula<br>
R1CH2OCF=CF2 in which R1 is hydrogen or F(CF2)Z and z is equal to 1, 2, 3 or<br>
4; the product of formula R3OCF=CH2 in which R3 is F(CF2)Z- and z is 1, 2, 3 or<br>
4; perfluorobutylethylene (PFBE); 3,3,3-trifluoropropene and 2,trifluoromethyl-<br>
3,3,3 -trifluoroprop-1-ene.<br>
The fluoropolymer may be a homopolymer or a copolymer, it may also comprise<br>
unfluorinated monomers such as ethylene or propylene.<br>
By way of example, the fluoropolymer is chosen from:<br>
homopolymers and copolymers of vinylidene fluoride (PVDF)<br>
preferably containing at least 50% by weight of VDF, the copolymer being<br>
chosen from chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP),<br>
trifluoroethylene (VF3) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE);<br>
ethylene/TFE copolymers (ETFE);<br>
homopolymers and copolymers of trifluoroethylene (VF3); and<br>
copolymers, and especially terpolymers, combining the residues<br>
of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), hexafluoro-<br>
propylene (HFP) and/or ethylene units and optionally VDF and/or VF3 units.<br>
Advantageously, the fluoropolymer is a PVDF homopolymer or copolymer. This<br>
is because this fluoropolymer has a good chemical resistance, especially to UV<br>
radiation and to chemicals, and it is easily converted by extrusion (more easily<br>
than PTFE or ETFE type copolymers). Preferably, the PVDF contains, by<br>
weight, at least 50% of VDF, more preferentially at least 75% and even more<br>
preferentially at least 85%. The comonomer is advantageously HFP.<br><br>
Advantageously, the PVDF has a viscosity ranging from 100 Pa.s to 4000 Pa.s,<br>
preferably from 300 to 1200 Pa.s, the viscosity being measured at 230°C, at a<br>
shear rate of 100 s"1 using a capillary rheometer. This is because these PVDFs<br>
are well suited to extrusion and injection moulding.<br>
Regarding the functionalized fluoropolymer, this is a fiuoropolymer bearing<br>
at least one polar group chosen from the following chemical groups: carboxylic<br>
acid, carboxylic acid salt, carbonate, carboxylic acid anhydride, epoxide,<br>
carboxylic acid ester, silyl, alkoxysilane, carboxylic acid amide, hydroxy and<br>
isocyanate. It may be a copolymer comprising at least one fluoromonomer and<br>
at least one unsaturated monomer bearing a polar group as is defined. The<br>
function of the polar group is to improve the adhesion of the fluoropolymer. The<br>
term "functionalized" denotes, more generally in the present application, for a<br>
polymer, the fact that this polymer bears a polar group as is defined.<br>
It is possible to obtain the functionalized fluoropolymer by copolymerizing or by<br>
grafting an unsaturated polar monomer. The functionalized fluoropolymer may<br>
be obtained by copolymerizing at least one fluoromonomer with at least one<br>
unsaturated polar monomer (described later on) and optionally with at least one<br>
other comonomer. For example, the functionalized polymer may be a PVDF<br>
comprising monomer units of VDF and of a monoesterified unsaturated diacid<br>
or of vinylene carbonate such as is described in document US 5 415 958.<br>
Another example of a functionalized fluoropolymer is that of a PVDF comprising<br>
monomer units of VDF and of itaconic or citraconic anhydride such as is<br>
described in document US 6 703 465 B2. The functionalized fluoropolymer may<br>
be prepared by an emulsion, suspension or solution process.<br>
The functionalized fluoropolymer may also be obtained by radical grafting of at<br>
least one unsaturated polar monomer (described later on) onto a fluoropolymer.<br>
The grafting may be carried out in that the melt state in the presence of a<br>
radical initiator. For example, in International Application WO 2001/081077,<br>
Example 5 describes the preparation of an ETFE onto which maleic anhydride<br><br>
is grafted. The grafting is carried out in the melt state at 300°C in an extruder in<br>
the presence of terf-butyl hydroperoxide.<br>
Grafting may also be carried out by irradiation of a blend, in the melt state, of a<br>
fluoropolymer and an unsaturated polar monomer. In this case, it will be called,<br>
to simplify matters, a radiation-grafted fluoropolymer. The fluoropolymer is first<br>
melt-blended with the unsaturated polar monomer. It is possible to use the<br>
melt-blending techniques known from the prior art, for example using an<br>
extruder or kneader. Preferably, an extruder will be used to convert the blend<br>
into granules. Grafting therefore takes place on a blend (in the bulk) and not at<br>
the surface of a powder such as is described, for example, in document<br>
US 5 576 106.<br>
Next, the blend of the fluoropolymer and of the unsaturated polar monomer is<br>
irradiated (□ or n radiation) in the solid state using an electron or photon source<br>
with a radiation dose between 10 and 200 kGray, preferably between 10<br>
and 150 kGray. The blend may, for example, be packaged in polyethylene<br>
bags, the air expelled and then the bags sealed. Advantageously, the dose is<br>
between 2 and 6 Mrad and preferably between 3 and 5 Mrad. Irradiation using a<br>
cobalt-60 bomb is particularly preferred.<br>
The amount of unsaturated polar monomer that is grafted is between, by<br>
weight, 0.1 and 5% (that is to say that the grafted unsaturated polar monomer<br>
corresponds to 0.1 to 5 parts per 99.9 to 95 parts of fluoropolymer),<br>
advantageously from 0.5 to 5%, preferably from 0.9 to 5%. This amount<br>
depends on the initial amount of unsaturated polar monomer in the blend to be<br>
irradiated. It also depends on the effectiveness of the grafting, therefore on the<br>
duration and the energy of the irradiation.<br>
The unsaturated polar monomer that has not been grafted and also the<br>
residues released by the grafting, especially HF, may then be optionally<br>
removed. This last step may be made necessary if the ungrafted unsaturated<br><br>
polar monomer is likely to destroy the adhesion or else for toxicology problems.<br>
This operation may be carried out according to the techniques known to a<br>
person skilled in the art. Vacuum degassing may be applied, optionally at the<br>
same time as heating. It is also possible to dissolve the modified fluoropolymer<br>
in a suitable solvent such as, for example, N-methylpyrrolidone, then to<br>
precipitate the polymer into a non-solvent, for example into water or else into an<br>
alcohol, or else to wash the radiation-grafted fluoropolymer using a solvent that<br>
is inert towards the fluoropolymer and the grafted functional groups. For<br>
example, when maleic anhydride is grafted, it may be washed with<br>
chlorobenzene.<br>
This is one of the advantages of this radiation-grafting method, being able to<br>
obtain higher contents of grafted unsaturated polar monomer than with the<br>
conventional grafting methods using a radical initiator. Thus, typically, with the<br>
radiation-grafting method it is possible to obtain contents greater than 1% (1<br>
part of unsaturated monomer per 99 parts of fluoropolymer), even greater than<br>
1.5%, which is not possible with a conventional grafting method in an extruder.<br>
On the other hand, the radiation grafting is carried out "cold", typically at<br>
temperatures below 100°C, even below 50°C, so that the blend to be irradiated<br>
is not in the melt state as for a conventional grafting method in an extruder. One<br>
essential difference is therefore that, in the case of a semicrystalline<br>
fluoropolymer (as is the case with PVDF for example), the grafting takes place<br>
in the amorphous phase and not in the crystalline phase whereas a<br>
homogenous grafting is produced in the case of grafting in an extruder in the<br>
melt state. The unsaturated polar monomer is therefore not distributed over the<br>
fluoropolymer chains in the same way in the case of radiation grafting as in the<br>
case of grafting in an extruder. The radiation-grafted fluorinated product<br>
therefore has a different distribution of the unsaturated polar monomer over the<br>
fluoropolymer chains relative to a product that would be obtained by grafting in<br>
an extruder.<br><br>
In the blend to be irradiated, the amount of fluoropolymer is, by weight, between<br>
80 and 99.9% per 0.1 to 20% respectively of unsaturated polar monomer.<br>
Preferably, the amount of fluoropolymer is from 90 to 99% per 1 to 10%<br>
respectively of unsaturated polar monomer.<br>
During this grafting step, it is preferable to avoid the presence of oxygen.<br>
Nitrogen or argon flushing of the blend to be irradiated is therefore possible for<br>
removing the oxygen. The radiation-grafted fluoropolymer has the very good<br>
chemical and oxidation resistance, and also the good thermomechanical<br>
behaviour of the fluoropolymer before its modification.<br>
Regarding the functionalized polyolefin, this is preferably a copolymer of<br>
ethylene and/or propylene and at least one unsaturated polar monomer.<br>
Preferably, the unsaturated polar monomer is chosen from:<br>
-	C1-C8 alkyl (meth)acrylates, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,<br>
2-ethylhexyl, isobutyl orcyclohexyl (meth)acrylates;<br>
-	unsaturated carboxylic acids, their salts and their anhydrides,<br>
especially acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic<br>
anhydride or citraconic anhydride;<br>
-	unsaturated epoxides, especially aliphatic glycidyl esters and ethers<br>
such as allyl glycidyl ether, vinyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl maleate and<br>
glycidyl itaconate, glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate, and<br>
also alicyclic glycidyl esters and ethers; and<br>
-	vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids, especially vinyl acetate,<br>
vinyl propionate or vinyl butyrate.<br>
The term "copolymer" is meant in the broad sense as described, for example, in<br>
the IUPAC nomenclature guide by E.S. Wilks or in IUPAC Basic Definitions of<br>
Terms Relating to Polymers, Pure Appl. Chem. 40,477-491 (1974). It also<br>
encompasses grafted copolymers.<br><br>
The functionalizecl polyolefin may be obtained by copolymerizing ethylene and<br>
at least one unsaturated polar monomer chosen from the previous list. The<br>
functionalized polyolefin may be a copolymer of ethylene and a polar monomer<br>
from the previous list or else a terpolymer of ethylene and of two unsaturated<br>
polar monomers chosen from the previous list. The copolymerization is carried<br>
out at high pressures greater than 1000 bar according to the process known as<br>
the high-pressure process (for example, described in documents FR-A-<br>
2498609, EP-A-0 174 244 or EP-A-0 177 378).<br>
The functionalized polyolefin obtained by copolymerization comprises, by<br>
weight, from 50 to 99.9% of ethylene, preferably from 60 to 99.9%, even more<br>
preferentially from 65 to 99% and from 0.1 to 50%, preferably from 0.1 to 40%,<br>
even more preferentially from 1 to 35% of at least one polar monomer from the<br>
previous list.<br>
For example, the functionalized polyolefin may comprise ethylene and an<br>
unsaturated epoxide, preferably glycidyl (meth)acrylate, and optionally a C1-C8<br>
alkyl (meth)acrylate or a vinyl ester of a saturated carboxylic acid. The content<br>
of unsaturated epoxide, especially of glycidyl (meth)acrylate, is between 0.1 and<br>
50%, advantageously between 0.1 and 40%, preferably between 1 and 35%,<br>
even more preferentially between 1 and 20%. It could be, for example,<br>
functionalized polyolefins sold by Arkema under the references LOTADER<br>
AX8840 (8% of glycidyl methacrylate, 92% of ethylene, melt flow index of 5<br>
according to ASTM D1238), LOTADER AX8900 (8% of glycidyl methacrylate,<br>
25% of methyl acrylate, 67% of ethylene, melt flow index of 6 according to<br>
ASTM D1238), and LOTADER AX8950 (9% of glycidyl methacrylate, 15% of<br>
methyl acrylate, 76% of ethylene, melt flow index of 85 according to ASTM<br>
D1238).<br>
The functionalized polyolefin may also comprise ethylene and an unsaturated<br>
acid anhydride, preferably maleic anhydride, and optionally a C1-C8 alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate or a vinyl ester of a saturated carboxylic acid. The content of<br><br>
unsaturated acid anhydride, especially of maleic anhydride, is between 0.1 and<br>
50%, advantageously between 0.1 and 40%, preferably between 1 and 35%,<br>
even more preferentially between 1 and 10%. It could be, for example,<br>
functionalizecl polyolefins sold by Arkema under the references LOTADER 2210<br>
(2.6% maleic anhydride, 6% butyl acrylate and 91.4% ethylene, melt flow index<br>
of 3 according to ASTM D1238), LOTADER 3340 (3% maleic anhydride, 16%<br>
butyl acrylate and 81% ethylene, melt flow index of 5 according to ASTM<br>
D1238), LOTADER 4720 (0.3% maleic anhydride, 30% ethyl acrylate and<br>
69.7% ethylene, melt flow index of 7 according to ASTM D1238), LOTADER<br>
7500 (2.8% maleic anhydride, 20% butyl acrylate and 77.2% ethylene, melt flow<br>
index of 70 according to ASTM D1238), OREVAC 9309, OREVAC 9314,<br>
OREVAC 9307Y, OREVAC 9318, OREVAC 9304 or OREVAC 9305.<br>
Functionalized polyolefin also denotes a polyolefin onto which an unsaturated<br>
polar monomer from the previous list is grafted by a radical route. The polyolefin<br>
is chosen from the previous list. Grafting takes place in an extruder or in<br>
solution in the presence of a radical initiator. As examples of radical initiators,<br>
the following could also be used: tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene<br>
hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide,<br>
tert-butylcumyl	peroxide,	dicumyl	peroxide,	1,3-bis(tert-<br>
butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene, benzyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, bis(3,5,5-<br>
trimethylhexanoyl) peroxide or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. Grafting of an<br>
unsaturated polar monomer onto a polyolefin is known to a person skilled in the<br>
art, for more details, reference can be made for example to documents EP<br>
689 505, US 523 5149, EP 658 139, US 675 0288 B2, US652 8587 B2. The<br>
polyolefin onto which the unsaturated polar monomer is grafted may be a<br>
polyethylene, especially high density polyethylene (HDPE) or low density<br>
polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), or very low<br>
density polyethylene (VLDPE). The polyethylene may be obtained using a<br>
Ziegler-Natta or Phillips type catalyst or else a metallocene-type catalyst or<br>
even by the high-pressure process. The polyolefin may also be a polypropylene,<br>
especially an isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylene. It could for example be<br><br>
functionalized polyolefins sold by Arkema under the references OREVAC<br>
18302, 18334, 18350, 18360, 18365, 18370, 18380, 18707, 18729, 18732,<br>
18750, 18760, PP-C, CA100.<br>
The polymer onto which the unsaturated polar monomer is grafted may also be<br>
a copolymer of ethylene and at least one unsaturated polar monomer chosen<br>
from:<br>
-	C1-C8 alkyl (meth)acrylates, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 2-<br>
ethylhexyl, isobutyl, or cyclohexyl (meth)acrylates; and<br>
-	vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids, especially vinyl acetate or<br>
vinyl propionate.<br>
It could for example be functionalized polyolefins sold by Arkema under the<br>
references OREVAC 18211, 18216 or 18630.<br>
Regarding the unsaturated polar monomer, this has a C=C double bond and<br>
also at least one polar group chosen from the following groups:<br>
-	carboxylic acid,<br>
-	carboxylic acid salt,<br>
-	carboxylic acid anhydride,<br>
-	epoxide,<br>
-	carboxylic acid ester,<br>
-	silyl,<br>
-	alkoxysilane,<br>
-	carboxylic acid amide,<br>
-	hydroxy, and<br>
-	isocyanate.<br>
Blends of several unsaturated monomers can also be envisaged.<br>
Unsaturated carboxylic acids having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms and their<br>
functional derivatives, particularly their anhydrides, are the particularly preferred<br>
unsaturated monomers. As examples of unsaturated monomers, mention is<br><br>
made of methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid,<br>
citraconic acid, undecylenic acid, aliylsuccinic acid, 4-cyclohexene-1,2-<br>
dicarboxylic	acid,	4-methyl-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic	acid,<br>
bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, x-methylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-<br>
2,3-dicarboxylic acid, zinc, calcium or sodium undecylenate, maleic anhydride,<br>
itaconic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, dichloromaleic anhydride,<br>
difluoromaleic anhydride, crotonic anhydride, glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate,<br>
allyl glycidyl ether, vinylsilanes such as vinyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane and D-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-<br>
silane.<br>
Other examples of unsaturated polar monomers include C1-C8 alkyl esters or<br>
glycidyl ester derivatives of unsaturated carboxylic acids such as methyl<br>
acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate,<br>
butyl methacrylate, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, monoethyl maleate,<br>
diethyl maleate, monomethyl fumarate, dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl<br>
itaconate, and diethyl itaconate; amide derivatives of unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acids such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, maleamide, malediamide, N-<br>
ethylmaleamide,	N,N-diethylmaleamide, N-butylmaleamide,	N,N-<br>
dibutylmaleamide, fumaramide, fumardiamide, N-ethylfumaramide, N,N-<br>
diethylfumaramide, N-butylfumaramide and N,N-dibutylfumaramide; imide<br>
derivatives of unsaturated carboxylic acids such as maleimide, N-<br>
butylmaleimide and N-phenylmaleimide; and metal salts of unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids such as sodium acrylate, sodium methacrylate, potassium<br>
acrylate, potassium methacrylate and zinc, calcium or sodium undecylenate.<br>
Preferably, the unsaturated polar monomer does not have more than one C=C<br>
double bond, as this leads to crosslinking of the fluoropolymer. Diacrylates or<br>
triacrylates are examples of unsaturated monomers having more than one C=C<br>
double bond. From this point of view, maleic anhydride and also the zinc,<br>
calcium and sodium undecylenates make good graftable compounds because<br><br>
they have a low tendency to homopolymerize or even to give rise to<br>
crosslinking.<br>
Advantageously, maleic anhydride is used. This is because this monomer offers<br>
the following advantages:<br>
-	it is solid and can easily be introduced with the fluoropolymer<br>
granules before the melt blending;<br>
-	it enables good adhesion properties to be obtained;<br>
-	it is particularly reactive towards many chemical functional groups,<br>
especially epoxide or hydroxyl functional groups;<br>
-	unlike other unsaturated monomers such as (meth)acrylic acid or<br>
acrylic esters, it does not homopolymerize and does not have to be<br>
stabilized.<br>
Regarding the barrier polymer, this term denotes a polymer that has a low<br>
permeability towards fuels and especially alcoholic fuels. Its permeability is<br>
preferably less than 150 g.mm/m2.day for the M15 fuel at 60°C. Examples of<br>
barrier polymers are the following:<br>
-	polyphenylene sulphide (PPS);<br>
-	polybutylene naphthalate (PBN);<br>
-	polybutyl terephthalate (PBT);<br>
-	EVOH;<br>
-	polydimethylketene;<br>
-	nylon MDX6; and<br>
-	polyglycolic acid (PGA).<br>
Regarding the EVOH, this thus denotes an ethylene-saponified vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer comprising from 20 to 70 mol%, advantageously from 25 to 60<br>
mol%, preferably from 25 to 40 mol% of ethylene. Preferably, the degree of<br>
saponification of its vinyl acetate component is at least 85% in mols, preferably<br>
at least 90%, even more preferentially at least 95%. The ethylene contents and<br>
the degree of saponification can be determined, for example, by proton NMR.<br><br>
Advantageously, the EVOH has a melt flow index between 0.5 and 100,<br>
preferably between 5 and 30 g/10 min (230°C/2.26 kg). It is understood that the<br>
EVOH may contain small amounts of other comonomer ingredients, including<br>
α-olefins such as propylene, isobutene, a-octene, unsaturated carboxylic acids<br>
or their salts, partial alkyl esters, complete alkyl esters, etc. It is also possible to<br>
combine two types of EVOH to improve the barrier and/or mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
Regarding the impact-modified barrier polymer, this is a blend comprising at<br>
least one barrier polymer and at least one impact modifier. The amount of<br>
impact modifier is between, by weight, 1 and 35% per 65 to 99% respectively of<br>
barrier polymer. The function of the impact modifier is to increase the impact<br>
strength of the barrier polymer. Another function is to make it possible to<br>
improve the deformation of the multilayer structure, especially at low<br>
temperature. The pipe may thus be deformed without having any cracking, in<br>
particular during an impact (e.g. of the type described in the standard UL-971<br>
entitled "Nonmetallic Underground Piping For Flammable Liquids").<br>
A person skilled in the art knows how to choose the impact modifier as a<br>
function of the barrier polymer. For example, in the case of EVOH, as was<br>
already taught in International Application WO 2005/014282, the impact<br>
modifier may be chosen from:<br>
a)	functionalized ethylene/alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymers;<br>
b)	elastomers, preferably EPRs, EPDMs and NBRs, these elastomers<br>
possibly being functionalized; and<br>
c)	linear or star S-B-S block copolymers that are optionally hydrogenated<br>
(they are then denoted by S-EB-S), these copolymers possibly being<br>
functionalized.<br>
Regarding a), the functional groups may be borne by an unsaturated monomer<br>
bearing at least one acid, acid anhydride or epoxide functional group. The<br><br>
amount of the unsaturated monomer may be up to 15% by weight of the<br>
copolymer and the amount of ethylene at least 50% by weight.<br>
For example, it is a copolymer of ethylene, an alkyl (meth)acrylate and an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic anhydride. Preferably, the alkyl (meth)acrylate is such<br>
that the alkyl has 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The alkyl (meth)acrylate may be<br>
chosen from methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, isobutyl<br>
acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. The melt flow index may range, for example,<br>
from 0.1 to 50 g/10 min (at 190°C under 2.16 kg).<br>
For example, it is a copolymer of ethylene, an alkyl (meth)acrylate and an<br>
unsaturated epoxide. Preferably, the alkyl (meth)acrylate is such that the alkyl<br>
has 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The melt flow index may range, for example, from<br>
0.1 to 50 g/10 min (at 190°C under 2.16 kg). Examples of the alkyl acrylate or<br>
methacrylate that can be used are, in particular, methyl methacrylate, ethyl<br>
acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. Examples of<br>
unsaturated epoxides that can be used are in particular:<br>
-	aliphatic glycidyl esters and ethers such as allyl glycidyl ether, vinyl<br>
glycidyl ether, glycidyl maleate and glycidyl itaconate, glycidyl acrylate<br>
and glycidyl methacrylate; and<br>
-	alicyclic glycidyl esters and ethers such as 2-cyclohexene-1-yl glycidyl<br>
ether,	diglycidyl	cyclohexene-4,5-dicarboxylate,	glycidyl<br>
cyclohexene-4-carboxylate, glycidyl 5-norbornene-2-methyl-2-carboxy-<br>
late and diglycidyl enafoc/sbicyclo[2.2.1] hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate.<br>
Regarding c), S-B-S triblocks are described in Ullmann's "Encyclopaedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry", Vol.A26, pages 655 - 659. As examples of S-B-S<br>
triblocks, mention may be made of the linear copolymers in which each block is<br>
linked to the other by means of a covalent bond or an intermediate molecule<br>
linked to one of the blocks by a covalent bond and to the other block by another<br>
covalent bond.<br><br>
The S block comprises at least 80% of at least one vinyl aromatic compound<br>
such as, for example, styrene, α-methylstyrene or vinyltoluene.<br>
The monomer used to synthesize the elastomeric B block may be a diene<br>
chosen from butadiene, isoprene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene or<br>
2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene. B is advantageously chosen from polydienes,<br>
especially polybutadiene, polyisoprene and their random copolymers, or else<br>
from partially or completely hydrogenated polydienes. Among the<br>
polybutadienes, those whose glass transition temperature (Tg) is the lowest are<br>
advantageously used, for example poly(1,4-butadiene) having a Tg (around<br>
-90°C) below that of poly(1,2-butadiene) (around 0°C). The B blocks may also<br>
be partially or completely hydrogenated. This hydrogenation is carried out<br>
according to the standard techniques. Preferably, the B blocks are mostly made<br>
from poly(1,4-butadiene).<br>
The linear S-B-S triblock has a number-average molecular weight which may be<br>
between 10 000 g/mol and 500 000 g/mol, preferably between 20 000 and<br>
200 000 g/mol. The S-B-S triblock is advantageously made from a B weight<br>
fraction between 5 and 95% and preferably between 15 and 85%.<br>
As another example of S-B-S triblocks, mention may be made of star S-B-S<br>
triblocks. The term "triblock" is not in agreement with the number of blocks, but<br>
the term "star S-B-S triblocks" is clear to a person skilled in the art. As<br>
examples of star triblocks, mention may be made of those of formula:<br><br>
in which n is equal to 1, 2 or 3 and S1 and B1 represent the blocks. The S1<br>
blocks represent polymerized styrene and B1 blocks represent polymerized<br><br>
butadiene, polymerized isoprene or a polymerized blend of butadiene and<br>
isoprene. The B1 blocks may be hydrogenated (they are then, for example,<br>
S-EB-S). Y denotes a polyfunctions entity resulting, for example, from<br>
polyfunctional coupling agents that are used in the manufacture of the star block<br>
copolymers. Such agents and also these block copolymers are described in<br>
US 3 639 521.<br>
The preferred star block copolymers contain 15 to 45% by weight, and better<br>
still 25 to 35%, of styrene units. The molecular weight is at least 140 000 and<br>
better still at least 160 000 g/mol.<br>
The particularly preferred star block copolymers are those described in<br>
EP 451 920. These copolymers are based on styrene and isoprene, the<br>
molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks is at least 12 000 and the<br>
polystyrene content is at most 35 wt% of the total weight of the block<br>
copolymer.<br>
The preferred linear block copolymers have a molecular weight between 70 000<br>
and 145 000 and contain 12 to 35% by weight of polystyrene. The particularly<br>
preferred linear block copolymers are those based on styrene and isoprene<br>
described in European Patent EP 451 919. These copolymers have polystyrene<br>
blocks with a molecular weight between 14 000 and 16 000 and a polystyrene<br>
content between 25 and 35% by weight of the block copolymer. The molecular<br>
weight is between 80 000 and 145 000, and better still between 100 000 and<br>
145 000.<br>
It is also possible to use a blend of linear S-B-S triblocks and star S-B-S<br>
triblocks. These linear or star S-B-S triblocks are available commercially under<br>
the trademarks FINAPRENE®, FINACLEAR®, KRATON® and STYROLUX®.<br>
Examples of EVOH, whether impact-modified or not<br><br>
An example of EVOH that is beneficial for the invention is the grade SOARNOL<br>
DC 3203 F sold by Nippon Gohsei. This grade has the following characteristics:<br>
ethylene content (mol%): 32;<br>
melt flow index (210°C/2.16 kg): 3.2 g/10 min;<br>
melting point: 183°C;<br>
crystallization temperature: 160°C; and<br>
oxygen permeability: 0.5 cc. 20 um/m2.day.atm.<br>
An example of impact-modified EVOH is obtained by blending 80% (by weight)<br>
of SOARNOL DT 2903 sold by Nippon Gohsei with 20% of maleicized EPR<br>
EXXELOR VA 1803 sold by Exxon Mobil Chemicals. SOARNOL DT 2903 has<br>
the following characteristics:<br>
ethylene content (mol%): 29;<br>
melt flow index (210°C/2.16 kg): 3.2 g/10 min;<br>
melting point: 188°C;<br>
crystallization temperature: 163°C; and<br>
oxygen permeability: 0.4 cc. 20 μm/m2.day.atm.<br>
The mechanical properties of the blend, tested on injection-moulded test pieces,<br>
are the following:<br><br>
The addition of maleicized EPR makes it possible to reduce the modulus and to<br>
increase the low temperature elongation at break and also the impact strength<br>
of the EVOH.<br>
Another example of impact-modified EVOH comprises:<br>
• an EVOH;<br><br>
•	a functionalized impact modifier (content from 1 to 30%), preferably an<br>
ethylene-propylene copolymer onto which maleic anhydride has been<br>
grafted (mEPR), a polyolefin onto which maleic anhydride has been<br>
grafted or else a copolymer of ethylene, ethyl acrylate, and maleic<br>
anhydride;<br>
•	optionally an unfunctionalized polyolefin (PE, PP, EPR); and<br>
•	optionally a polyamide or a copolyamide or blend being finely dispersed<br>
in the EVOH (for example PA-6).<br>
Regarding a first embodiment of the multilayer structure, this comprises<br>
(from the inside towards the outside):<br>
•	a layer C1 comprising at least one functionalized fluoropolymer,<br>
optionally blended with at least one compatible fluoropolymer;<br>
•	a layer C2 comprising at least one adhesive tie;<br>
•	a layer C3 comprising at least one polyolefin, preferably a<br>
polyethylene;<br>
•	a layer C4 comprising at least one adhesive tie; and<br>
•	a barrier layer C5 comprising at least one barrier polymer, optionally<br>
impact-modified,<br>
the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br>
Layer C1<br>
The role of C1 is to chemically protect the other layers. C1 also has a barrier<br>
function. The amount of functionalized fluoropolymer ranges, by weight, from 1<br>
to 99%, preferably from 50 to 90%, per 99 to 1%, preferably 50 to 10%, of<br>
compatible fluoropolymer.<br>
Laver C2<br>
The role of C2 is to promote the adhesion between C1 and C3. Preferably, in<br>
order to obtain good adhesion, the adhesive tie from C2 comprises at least one<br>
thermoplastic polymer bearing chemical functional groups that react with the<br>
unsaturated polar monomer of the functionalized fluoropolymer (hereinafter, to<br><br>
simplify matters, they will be referred to as "reactive chemical functional<br>
groups"). For example, if the functionalized fluoropolymer bears acid and/or<br>
anhydride functional groups, the polymer of the adhesive tie from C2 may bear<br>
epoxide or hydroxy functional groups. Similarly, if the functionalized<br>
fluoropolymer bears epoxide and/or hydroxy functional groups, the polymer of<br>
the adhesive tie from C2 may bear acid and/or anhydride functional groups.<br>
So that there is good adhesion with C3, the adhesive tie (and therefore<br>
especially the thermoplastic polymer) from C2 must also preferably be<br>
compatible with the polyolefin. This is why the polymer bearing reactive<br>
chemical functional groups is preferably chosen from functionalized polyolefins.<br>
By way of example, in the case where the polyolefin from C3 is a polyethylene it<br>
is possible to use, for the thermoplastic polymer bearing reactive functional<br>
groups, a polyethylene onto which an unsaturated polar monomer has been<br>
grafted. It could also be a copolymer of ethylene and an unsaturated polar<br>
monomer and optionally an alkyl (meth)acrylate. As another example, if the<br>
polyolefin from C3 is a polypropylene, it could be possible to use a<br>
polypropylene onto which an unsaturated polar monomer has been grafted.<br>
The polymer bearing reactive chemical functional groups may optionally be<br>
blended with a compatible and viscous polyolefin in order to form the adhesive<br>
tie from C2. The term "viscous polyolefin" is understood to mean a polyolefin<br>
having a melt flow index between 0.1 and 1 g/10min (190°C/2.16 kg). The<br>
Applicant has thus observed that with certain blends, it is possible to obtain a<br>
very strong adhesion between C1 and C3 (therefore a peel strength between<br>
these layers between 10 and 100 N/cm) and also to avoid the extrusion flaws<br>
(e.g. extrusion waviness). An example of such an adhesive tie comprises, by<br>
weight, from 1 to 80%, advantageously from 10 to 50%, preferably from 10 to<br>
40% of at least one polymer bearing reactive chemical functional groups and<br>
from 99 to 20%, advantageously from 90 to 50%, preferably from 90 to 60% of<br>
at least one compatible polyolefin having a flow index between 0.1 and<br>
1 g/10min(190°C/2.16kg).<br><br>
Layer C4<br>
The role of C4 is to promote the adhesion between C3 and C5. The adhesive tie<br>
from C4 comprises at least one thermoplastic polymer bearing chemical<br>
functional groups that react with the functional groups present on the barrier<br>
polymer from C5 and/or optionally with those present on the impact modifier of<br>
the barrier polymer from C5. For example, in the case where the barrier polymer<br>
is an EVOH, the thermoplastic polymer from C4 may be a polyethylene<br>
functionalized by carboxylic acid anhydride groups, preferably maleic anhydride.<br>
For example, it could be a polyethylene onto which maleic anhydride has been<br>
grafted.<br>
So that there is good adhesion with C3, the adhesive tie from C4 must also<br>
preferably be compatible with the polyolefin. This is why the polymer bearing<br>
reactive chemical functional groups is preferably chosen from functionalized<br>
polyolefins. By way of example, in the case where the polyolefin from C3 is a<br>
polyethylene it is possible to use, for the thermoplastic polymer bearing reactive<br>
functional groups, a polyethylene onto which an unsaturated polar monomer<br>
has been grafted. It could also be a copolymer of ethylene and an unsaturated<br>
polar monomer and optionally an alkyl (meth)acrylate. As another example, if<br>
the polyolefin from C3 is a polypropylene, it could be possible to use a<br>
polypropylene onto which an unsaturated polar monomer has been grafted.<br>
According to a variant of this first embodiment, it is possible to remove C4 if the<br>
thermoplastic polymer bearing reactive chemical functional groups is blended<br>
with the polyolefin from C3. The multilayer structure then comprises in the order<br>
(from the inside towards the outside):<br>
•	a layer C1 comprising at least one functionalized fluoropolymer,<br>
optionally blended with at least one compatible fluoropolymer;<br>
•	a layer C2 comprising at least one adhesive tie;<br>
•	a layer C3 comprising at least one polyolefin, preferably a<br>
polyethylene, as a blend with a thermoplastic polymer bearing<br><br>
chemical functional groups that react with the functional groups<br>
present on the barrier polymer from C5 and/or optionally with those<br>
present on the impact modifier of the barrier polymer from C5; and<br>
•	a barrier layer C5 comprising at least one barrier polymer, optionally<br>
impact-modified,<br>
the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the thermoplastic polymer varies, by weight, from 0.1<br>
to 50%, advantageously from 1 to 50%, per 99.9 to 50%, advantageously from<br>
99 to 50% respectively of polyolefin.<br>
Regarding a second embodiment of the multilayer structure, this comprises<br>
(from the inside towards the outside):<br>
•	a layer C'1 comprising at least one functionalized fluoropolymer,<br>
optionally blended with at least one compatible fluoropolymer;<br>
•	a barrier layer C'2 comprising at least one barrier polymer, optionally<br>
impact-modified;<br>
•	a layer C'3 comprising at least one polyolefin, preferably a<br>
polyethylene, as a blend with a thermoplastic polymer bearing<br>
chemical functional groups that react with the functional groups<br>
present on the barrier polymer(s) and/or optionally with those present<br>
on the impact modifier of the barrier polymer from C'2 and C'4; and<br>
•	a barrier layer C'4 comprising at least one barrier polymer, optionally<br>
impact-modified,<br>
the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br>
Layer C'1<br>
This has the same characteristics as those given for C1. The unsaturated polar<br>
monomer of the functionalized fluoropolymer reacts with the chemical functional<br>
groups of the barrier polymer from C'2 and optionally with those of the impact<br>
modifier from C'2.<br><br>
Layer C'2<br>
The fact of having two barrier layers C'2 and C'4 reduces the overall<br>
permeability of the multilayer structure. The deformation resistance of a<br>
multilayer structure in pipe form is improved when the barrier polymer from C 2<br>
is impact-modified. The impact strength of the pipe is also improved when the<br>
barrier polymer from C 4 is impaetnodified.<br>
Preferred embodiments<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the first embodiment and its variant<br>
and also of the second embodiment:<br>
•	the functionalized fluoropolymer is a functionalized PVDF;<br>
•	the fluoropolymer that is optionally blended with the functionalized<br>
fluoropolymer is a PVDF;<br>
•	the polyolefin from C3 or C'3 is a polyethylene;<br>
•	the adhesive tie from C4 is a thermoplastic polymer bearing chemical<br>
functional groups that react with the functional groups present on the<br>
barrier polymer from C5 and/or optionally with those present on the<br>
impact modifier of the barrier polymer from C5; and<br>
•	the barrier polymer from C5, C'2 and C'4 is an EVOH;<br>
•	the thermoplastic polymer from C2, C3, C4 and C'3 is a functionalized<br>
polyolefin.<br>
Preferably, the functionalized fluoropolymer is a PVDF onto which an acid<br>
anhydride, preferably maleic anhydride, has been radiation-grafted. This<br>
fluoropolymer extrudes very well and in addition has excellent adhesion.<br>
Furthermore, the combination of a PVDF with EVOH makes the multilayer<br>
structure a barrier against a large number of molecules, which makes it able to<br>
be used for many types of fuels. EVOH also has a good<br>
permeability/coextrudability trade-off relative to other barrier polymers (such as<br>
for example PPS).<br><br>
For the two embodiments of the invention and their variants, it is also possible<br>
to envisage placing a layer of at least one fluoropolymer against the layer<br>
comprising at least one functionalized fluoropolymer. This layer is then the<br>
internal layer in contact with the fluid which is stored or transferred.<br>
Examples of multilayer structures<br>
One example of a multilayer structure comprises (from the inside towards the<br>
outside):<br>
•	a layer comprising a PVDF onto which maleic anhydride has been<br>
radiation-grafted, optionally as a blend with a compatible PVDF;<br>

the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br>
Another example of a multilayer structure comprises (from the inside towards<br>

The PVDF may be a homopolymer or a copolymer. Preferably, the adhesive tie<br>
is a polyethylene bearing chemical functional groups that react with maleic<br>
anhydride. It is preferably a polyethylene bearing epoxide functional groups.<br>
Preferably, the polyethylene is a PE 100.<br><br>
According to a third embodiment, the multilayer structure comprises (from the<br>
inside towards the outside):<br>

impact-modified;<br>

•	a layer C*3 comprising at least one polyolefin;<br>
•	a layer C*4 comprising at least one adhesive tie; and<br>
•	a barrier layer C*5 comprising at least one barrier polymer, optionally<br>
impact-modified,<br>
the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br>
Layer C*1<br>
This has the same characteristics as those described for C1.<br>
Layers C*2 and C*4<br>
The adhesive tie from C*2 and/or C*4 preferably comprises a thermoplastic<br>
polymer bearing chemical functional groups that react with those of the barrier<br>
polymer and/or optionally those of the impact modifier. The thermoplastic<br>
polymer is, in addition, compatible with the polyolefin.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the third embodiment:<br>
•	the barrier polymer is an EVOH; and<br>
•	the thermoplastic polymer from C*2 and C*4 is a functionalized<br>
polyolefin.<br>
One example of a multilayer structure comprises (from the inside towards the<br>
outside):<br>
•	a layer comprising an impact-modified EVOH;<br>
•	a layer comprising a polyethylene onto which maleic anhydride has<br>
been grafted;<br>
•	a layer comprising a polyethylene;<br><br>
•	a layer comprising a polyethylene onto which maleic anhydride has<br>
been grafted; and<br>
•	a layer comprising an impact-modified EVOH,<br>
the layers being placed against each other in the order indicated.<br>
Presence of additives in the layers<br>
In all the multilayer structures that have just been described, each of the layers<br>
may optionally comprise one or more additives chosen from dyes and/or<br>
pigments, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, flame retardants, mineral fillers, etc. In<br>
particular, each of the layers may be rendered conductive using a conductive<br>
filler that is able to dissipate electrical charges, such as a carbon black or<br>
carbon nanotubes. These are more particularly for the layer in contact with the<br>
fluid to be transferred or stored. Preferably, the resistivity of the layer that has<br>
been rendered conductive is less than 106 □.cm.<br>
Thicknesses of the layers<br>
Preferably, layers C3 or C'3 or C*3 that comprise the polyolefin have a<br>
thickness ranging from 1 to 10 mm so as to provide the structure with an overall<br>
rigidity, good mechanical behaviour and also good hydrostatic pressure<br>
behaviour. The other layers have a thickness which may range preferably from<br>
25 to 1000 urn.<br>
The multilayer structure may be in the form of a film, pipe, tube, container or<br>
tank. The layer in contact with the fluid to be transported or stored is layer C1,<br>
C'1 or C*1 or else the fluoropolymer layer that is placed against C1 or C'1. This<br>
structure has as permeability less than or equal to 1 g/m2.day according to the<br>
standard UL-971.<br>
The multilayer structure and the polymer blends are produced using known<br>
techniques for converting plastics. Advantageously, an extruder is used to<br>
produce the blends. In order to manufacture a pipe or a tube, the coextrusion<br>
technique may be used that relies on the use of as many extruders as there are<br><br>
superposed layers. In the case of a tank or a hollow body, blow moulding of<br>
hollow bodies may be used.<br>
Applications<br>
The multilayer structure in pipe, tube, container or tank form has advantageous<br>
barrier properties towards various fuels (petrol, diesel, alcoholic petrol, alcohol,<br>
etc.) for storing or transferring a fuel. It may be, for example, a tube supplying<br>
fuel from the tank to the engine or, in a filling station, a tube supplying fuel from<br>
the storage tank to the vehicle or to the fuel pump. The fuel may be a petrol, a<br>
diesel or an alcoholic petrol currently produced in certain countries such as<br>
Brazil (of the flex-fuel or biodiesel type comprising a high methanol and/or<br>
ethanol content).<br>
For safety and environmental protection reasons, automotive manufacturers<br>
impose, on pipes for transporting fuel, both mechanical characteristics such as<br>
burst strength and flexibility with good low temperature (-40°C) and high<br>
temperature (125°C) impact strength, and also very low permeability to<br>
hydrocarbons and to their additives, in particular alcohols such as methanol and<br>
ethanol. These pipes must also have a good resistance to fuels and to engine<br>
lubricating oils. Among the characteristics of the specifications, five are<br>
particularly difficult to obtain jointly in a simple manner:<br>
-	low-temperature (-40°C) impact strength- the pipe does not brake;<br>
-	resistance to fuels;<br>
-	high-temperature (125°C) resistance;<br>
-	very low permeability to fuel (
having an outside diameter of 50 mm); and<br>
-	good dimensional stability of the pipe when using it with fuel.<br>
Examples<br>
The following products were used:<br>
EVOH: SOARNOL.® DT 2903 from Nippon Gohsei.<br><br>
Impact EVOH: EVOH impact-modified by maleicized EPR. For this EVOH is<br>
blended with maleicized EPR using a Werner 40 twin-screw extruder at a<br>
temperature of 240°C (15% EPR).<br>
LOTADER® 8840: copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate (8 wt%) and ethylene<br>
(92 wt%), having a melt flow index of 6 (190°C/2.16 kg).<br>
OREVAC® 18334: polyethylene onto which maleic anhydride is grafted, having<br>
a melt flow index of 1 (190°G 2.16 kg).<br>
PVDF-1: KYNAR® 720 onto which maleic anhydride has been radiation-grafted<br>
(see below), having a melt flow index of 13 (230°C/ 5 kg), diluted to 30% by<br>
weight in ungrafted KYNAR® 720 (70% unmodified KYNAR + 30% modified<br>
KYNAR).<br>
PVDF-2: KYNAR FLEX® 2750 onto which maleic anhydride has been radiation-<br>
grafted (see below), having a flow index of 11 (230°C/5 kg), diluted to 50% in<br>
ungrafted KYNAR® 2750 (50% unmodified KYNAR + 50% modified KYNAR).<br>
PE-100: sold by Borealis, having a melt flow index of 0.3 (190°C/2.16 kg).<br>
maleicized EPR: EXXELOR® VA 1803 sold by Exxon Mobil Chemicals, having<br>
a melt flow index of 3 (230°C/2.16kg).<br>
M15 fuel: 42.5% toluene + 42.5% isooctane + 15% methanol;<br>
M85 fuel: 7.5% toluene + 7.5% isooctane + 85% methanol.<br>
Grafting onto KYNAR® 720 is carried out by first melt-blending the KYNAR® 720<br>
(homopolymer having a melt volume rate of 10 cm3/10 min at 230°C under 5 kg)<br>
with 2 wt% of maleic anhydride. The blend is prepared using a twin-screw<br>
extruder at 230°C and 150 rpm at athroughput of 10 kg/h. After the extrusion<br>
step, 1.8% of maleic anhydride remains in the product, the rest being lost during<br>
the extrusion step. The product thus prepared is bagged in impermeable<br>
aluminium bags. These bags are then irradiated with 3 Mrad using a cobalt<br>
bomb. A grafting level of 40% is determined, this level is verified after a<br>
solubilization/precipitation step. The PVDF grafted by maleic anhydride is then<br>
placed under vacuum overnight at 130°C in order to evacuate the residual<br>
maleic anhydride and the hydrofluoric acid released during the radiation. This<br><br>
product is then diluted by blending 30% of this product with 70% of KYNAR®<br>
720, thus the PVDF-1 is obtained.<br>
Grafting onto KYNAR FLEX® 2750 is carried out by first melt-blending the<br>
KYNAR® 2750 (homopolymer having a melt volume rate of 10 cm3/10 min at<br>
230°C under 5 kg) with 2 wt% of maleic anhydride. The blend is prepared using<br>
a twin-screw extruder at 230°C and 150 rpm at a throughput of 10kg/h. After<br>
the extrusion step, 1.95% of maleic anhydride remains in the product, the rest<br>
being lost during the extrusion step. The product thus prepared is bagged in<br>
impermeable aluminium bags. These bags are then irradiated with 2 Mrad using<br>
a cobalt bomb. A grafting level of 40% is determined, this level is verified after a<br>
solubilization/precipitation step. The KYNAR FLEX® grafted by maleic anhydride<br>
is then placed under vacuum overnight at 130°C in order to evacuate the<br>
residual maleic anhydride and the hydrofluoric acid released during the<br>
radiation. This product is then diluted by blending 50% of this product with 50%<br>
of KYNARFLEX® 2750, thus the PVDF-2 is obtained.<br>
