PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
levetiracetam and to a process for its preparation.<br>
Levetiracetam or (S)-(-)-a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide, a laevorotatory<br>
compound, is disclosed as a protective agent for the treatment and the prevention of<br>
hypoxic and ischemic type aggressions of the central nervous system in the European<br>
patent No. EP 0 162 036 B and has the following formula.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
This compound is also effective in the treatment of epilepsy, a therapeutic<br>
indication for which it has been demonstrated that its dextrorotatory enantiomer (R)-(-)-<br>
a-ethyl-2-oxo- 1-pyrrolidine acetamide completely lacks activity (A.J. Gower et al., Eur.<br>
J. Phannacol., 222, 1992,193-203).<br>
A film-coated tablet containing 250 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg levetiracetam is<br>
described in Rote Liste Service Gmbh "Rote Liste 2003, 2002, ECV - Editio Cantor,<br>
Aulendorf, Germany. The ingredients are maize starch, povidone K30, talc, colloidal<br>
anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, and in the coating hypromellose, macrogol 4000,<br>
titanium dioxide.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising levetiracetam may present modified<br>
kinetics of release of the active substance as times goes along. This may lead to a slower<br>
release in time of the active ingredient and thus to reduced stability of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition. One of the consequences of this reduced stability may be<br>
an ealier expiry date of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
According to one aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising levetiracetam as active ingredient and<br>

colloidal silica, polyethylene glycol 6000, magnesium stearate and Opadry® in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising levetiracetam is less than 10% per weight with<br>
respect to the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention<br>
may contain a diluent or filler.<br>
The term "diluent" or "filler" as used herein is defined as an inert agent designed<br>
to increase the weight and/or the size of the pharmaceutical composition, for example in<br>
the case of a tablet.<br>
The diluent or the filler may be present in the pharmaceutical composition hi the<br>
form of a single compound or in the form of a mixture of compounds.<br>
Preferably the diluent of the filler is added when the amount of the active<br>
ingredient and the other excipients is too small to obtain a tablet of suitable size.<br>
Examples of diluents or fillers according to the present invention are starches,<br>
lactose, mannitol, sugars or mineral salts.<br>
Percentages per weight of diluent or filler necessary to obtain a pharmaceutical<br>
composition according to the present invention will be determined according to<br>
conventional methods known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention<br>

Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention<br>
comprises a coating agent which has taste-masking properties.<br>
Generally, existing pharmaceutical composition comprising levetiracetam are<br>
manufactured by a wet granulation process according to conventional methods known<br>
to the man skilled in the art.<br>
Such a wet granulation process may cause degradation of the active ingredient<br>
upon contact with the liquid phase. Furthermore, such a process requires a drying step<br>
which is time consuming and, due to the presence of a heat source, increases costs of<br>
production.<br>
Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention relates to a process of<br>
manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition comprising levetiracetam as active<br>
ingredient and<br>
2.0 to 9.0% per weight of disintegrant,<br>
0 to 3.0% per weight of gliding agent,<br>
0.5 to 6.0% per weight of binder, and<br>
0.0 to 1.0% per weight of lubricant,<br>
with respect to the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition,<br>
which process comprises the steps of:<br>
i) mixing levetiracetam, the gliding agent, the disintegrant and the binder,<br>

the lubricant;<br>
iv) compacting the mixture obtained in step iii),<br>
v) grinding the mixture obtained in step iv), and<br>
vi) compressing the mixture obtained hi step v).<br>
The term "compacting" as used herein is defined as the transformation of a<br>
powder into a coherent specimen of a defined shape by compression (eg by a roller<br>
compacter).<br>
The term "grinding" as used herein is defined as the reduction of the particle size<br>
by sieving.<br>
The term "compressing" as used herein is defined as the application of a<br>
sufficient force by the punches of a tablet press on a powder to compact it into a tablet.<br>
Preferably, at least one of levetiracetam, disintegrant, gliding agent or binder<br>
undergoes desagglomeration prior to mixing.<br>
The term "desagglomeration" as used herein is defined as the disruption of<br>
agglomerates in the powder.<br>
Preferably, the grinding step is achieved on a sieve of less than 5 mm, more<br>
preferably less than 3 mm, most preferably on a sieve of 1.5 mm.<br>
The process according to the present invention comprises fewer steps than the<br>
wet granulation process thus ensuring lower costs of production. Furthermore, said<br>
process avoids degradation of the active ingredient upon contact with a liquid phase.<br>
Preferably, the process comprises a further coating step in which water,<br>
preferably purified water, is added to the coating agent and resulting suspension is<br>
sprayed on the mixture resulting from step vi).<br>
Preferred coating agent is Opadry®. More preferred coating agent is selected<br>

skilled in the art will appreciate that routine variations and modifications of the<br>
following examples can be made without exceeding the spirit or scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Table I shows four pharmaceutical compositions (A, B, C and D) with different<br>
quantities of active ingredient levetiracetam which were manufactured according to the<br>
process disclosed in figure 1, referred to as dry granulation process.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 2<br>
Table II shows four pharmaceutical compositions (E, F, G and H) with different<br>
quantities of active ingredient levetiracetam which were manufactured according to the<br>
process disclosed in figure 2, referred to as wet granulation process. These compositions<br>
are not within the scope of the present invention and have been manufactured for<br>
comparative study.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3<br>
Kinetics of release of active ingredient have been measured for compositions A<br>
to H. These kinetics have been measured for all compositions immediately after<br>
manufacturing and six months after manufacturing. During these six months, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions have been kept under blister at 40°C and at a level of<br>
relative humidity of 75%.<br>
The dissolution tests are made in an USP Apparatus 2 (paddle apparatus),<br>
volume 900 mL, speed 50 rpm, and temperature 37°C.<br>
Figures 3 to 10 show that for pharmaceutical compositions manufactured<br>
according to the dry granulation process, pourcentages of dissolution are more stable<br>
than for compositions manufactured according to the wet granulation process. This<br>
suggests that pharmaceutical compositions A to D are more stable in time than<br>
pharmaceutical compositions E to H.<br>
