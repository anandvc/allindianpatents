Field  of the  Invention<br>
	The  present  invention  relates  to  a  method  and  apparatus  for<br>
generating  On-Screen-Display  (OSD)  messages.     More  particularly, this  invention  relates  to  a  method  and  apparatus  that  reduces  the memory   bandwidth   requirements   of   a   decoding/displaying system by using one-bit pixels  to access a palette that  is pre-<br>
 defined for an OSD region.<br>
Background   of  the   Invention<br>
On-Screen-Display  messages  play  an  important  role   in consumer  electronics   products   by  providing   users   with   interactive<br>
information  such  as  menus  to  guide  them  through  the  usage  and configuration of the product.    Other important features of OSD include the ability to provide Closed Captioning and the display of channel   logos.<br>
However,   the  heightened  standard  of digital  video<br>
technology   presents   an  ever  increasing  problem  of generating   and displaying OSD messages.    For example, there are specific High Definition Television (HDTV) requirements that an HDTV must display up to 216 characters in four (4)  "windows"  versus  the current National  Television Systems  Committee  (NTSC) requirements of a maximum of  128 characters  in one "window". These  new  requirements  place  severe  strains  on   the decoding/displaying   system   for  television   signals,   which   must decode the incoming encoded data streams  and  present the decoded data to a display system with minimal delays.    Since OSD messages  must  be  displayed  (overlaid)  with  the  video  data,  the microprocessor  of  the  decoding/displaying   system   must  assign   a portion  of the  memory  bandwidth  to perform OSD  functions, thereby   increasing   the   memory   bandwidth   requirements   of  a decoding/displaying   system   and   the   overall   computational<br>
overhead.<br><br>
2<br>
Thus,  a need exists for a method and apparatus for generating  On-Screen-Display  (OSD)  messages   without  increasing the  hardware  requirements,   e.g.,   memory  bandwidth,   of  a decoding/displaying    system.<br>
Summary   of  the   Invention<br>
The  invention  concerns  an  apparatus  and  concomitant method for generating OSD messages by constructing a valid OSD bitstream having  a plurality of "one-bit"  pixels.<br>
More specifically, in accordance with the invention, an OSD unit retrieves an OSD bitstream from a storage device.    The OSD bitstream contains an OSD header and OSD data.    The OSD header contains control information that is used to program a color<br>
palette of the OSD unit and to provide instructions as to the treatment of the OSD data.    The control information is programmed  by  a processor of a decoding/displaying  system.     If the "Compressed Pixel Mode" is enabled in the OSD header, then the OSD unit will treat each bit of the OSD data in the OSD bitstream as a "one-bit" pixel.    Namely, each OSD data bit represents  one of two possible  indices,  where  each  index identifies one of the many possible OSD palette entries.    For example, if there  are   16  possible entries  which  are  accessible by 4-bit addresses, then the "one-bit" pixel can access two of the possible entries using only a single bit.<br>
        These and other aspects of the invention will be described with  respect  to  the  accompanying  drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
FIG.   1  illustrates a block diagram of a decoding/displaying system  for  television  signals   100  (hereinafter  decoding   system). The  decoding  system comprises  a processor  130,  a random  access memory (RAM)  140, a read-only memory (ROM) 142, an OSD unit 150, a video decoder 160, and a mixer 170.    The output of the mixer  170 is coupled to a display device  190 via path  180.<br>
The  present invention is  described below  in  accordance  with the MPEG  standards,  ISO/IEC international Standards  11172 (1991)  (generally referred  to  as  MPEG-1   format)  and   13818 (1995)  (generally referred to as MPEG-2 format).    However,  those skilled in the art will realize that the present invention can be applied  or  adapted  to  other  decoding  systems  implementing  other encoding/decoding   formats.<br>
In   the  preferred  embodiment,   the  decoding  system   100 performs  real  time  audio  and  video decompression  of various  data streams  (bitstreams)   120.     The  bitstreams   120  may  comprise audio  and  video  elementary  streams  that  are  encoded  in compliance with the MPEG-1  and MPEG-2 standards.    The encoded bitstreams   120  are  generated by  an  encoder  (not  shown)  and  are transmitted  to  the  decoding  system  through  a  communication channel.     The  encoded  bitstreams  contain  a  coded  representation of a plurality of images and may include the audio information associated with those images, e.g., a multimedia data stream.    The multimedia source may be a HDTV station, a video disk, a cable television station and the like.    In turn,  the decoding system  100 decodes  the  encoded bitstreams  to produce  a plurality  of decoded images  for presentation  on  the  display   190 in  synchronization with  the  associated  audio information.     However,  for the purpose of this invention, the audio decoding function of the decoding system   100 is  not discussed.<br><br>
4	<br>
More   specifically,  processor   130  receives  bitstreams   120<br>
and  bitstreams   110  as  inputs.     Bitstreams   110  may  comprise various  control  signals  or other data  streams  that are  not  included in the bitstreams  120.    For example,  a channel decoder or<br>
transport  unit  (not  shown)  can  be  deployed  between  the transmission  channel  and  the  decoding  system   100  to  effect the parsing  and routing  of data packets  into data  streams  or control streams.<br>
In   the   preferred   embodiment,   processor   130   performs<br>
 various  control  functions,  including but not limited  to, providing control data to the video decoder 160 and OSD unit  150, managing access to the memory and controlling the display of the decoded images.     Although  the present invention describes  a single processor,  those skilled in the art will realize that the processor<br>
!  130 may  comprise  various  dedicated devices  to manage  specific functions,  e.g.,  a memory  controller,  a microprocessor interface unit and the like.<br>
Processor   130  receives  bitstreams   120  and  writes  the  data packets into the memory  140 via video decoder  160.    The<br>
) bitstreams  may  optionally  pass  through  a  First-In-First-Out  (FIFO) buffer  (not  shown)  before  being  transferred  via  a  memory  data bus  to  the  memory.     Furthermore,  there  is  generally  another memory (not shown) which is used solely by the processor  130. The memory  140 is used to store a plurality of data<br>
including compressed data, decoded images and the OSD bit map. As  such,  the memory  is  generally mapped into various  buffers, e.g., a bit buffer for storing compressed data, an OSD buffer for storing the OSD bit map, various frame buffers for storing frames of images and a display buffer for storing decoded images.<br>
	In accordance with the MPEG standards,  the video  decoder<br>
160 decodes the compressed data in the memory  140 to reconstruct the encoded images in the memory.     In  some cases, the decoded image is a difference signal that is added to a stored reference image to produce the actual image,  e.g., to facilitate<br>
 decoding a motion compensated image.    Once an image is<br><br>
5	RCA 88,22<br>
reconstructed,  it  is  stored  in  the  display  buffer  pending  display<br>
via the mixer  170.<br>
Similarly,  the OSD unit  150 uses the memory  140 to store the OSD bit map or the OSD specification.   The OSD unit allows a user (manufacturer) to define a bit map for each field which can be superimposed on the decoded image.    The OSD bit map may contain  information  concerning  the  configuration  and  options  of a particular consumer electronics  product.     Alternatively,  the  OSD bit map may contain  information relating to Closed Captioning  and channel  logos  that are  transmitted  from  a cable  television,  a  video disk and the like.    An OSD bit map is defined as a set of regions (generally   in   rectangular  shapes)   of  programmable  position   and size, each of which has a unique palette of available colors.<br>
The OSD bit map is written into the OSD buffer of the 'memory  140 which is assigned for this purpose by the user. However, those skilled in the art will realize that a ROM  142 or other equivalent  storage  devices can  also  serve this  function  as well.<br>
When the OSD function is enabled for a particular image or frame,  the processor  130 manipulates the data in memory   140 to construct an OSD bitstream.    The OSD bitstream contains an OSD header and OSD data (pixel data).<br>
More  specifically,  the  processor   130  programs  (formats  and stores) the OSD header in the memory  140.    The OSD header contains  information concerning  the  locations  of the  top  and bottom OSD field bit maps, palette data, pointer to the next header block and various display modes involving OSD resolution, color and compression.    Once the OSD header is programmed, the processor  130 may manipulate the OSD data in the memory  140 in "accordance  with  a particular  implementation.     For example,  the OSD data is formatted in accordance with a selected mode, e.g.. the Compressed  Pixel  Mode  as discussed below.     Alternatively,  the processor may  simply program  the OSD header with  pointers to the OSD data in the memory, where the stored OSD data is retrieved  without  modification  to  form  the  OSD bitstream.<br><br>
6	<br>
The processor  130 then reports the enable status, e.g., OSD<br>
active, to the OSD unit  150, which responds by requesting the processor  130 for access  to the OSD bitstream stored within the memory  140.    The OSD bitstream is formed and retrieved as the<br>
OSD unit reads the OSD headers, each followed by its associated OSD data.    After receiving the OSD bitstream, the OSD unit processes the OSD pixel data in accordance with the instructions or selected modes in the OSD header.    The OSD unit then waits for a pair of display counters  (not shown) to attain count values  that<br>
identifies the correct position on the display for inserting the OSD information.    At the correct position, the OSD unit forwards its output to the mixer 170.    The output of the OSD unit 150 is a stream   or  sequence  of digital  words  representing  respective luminance  and  chrominance  components.     New  memory  accesses<br>
'are  requested  as  required  to  maintain  the  necessary  data  flow (OSD bitstream) through the OSD unit to produce a comprehensive OSD display.    When the last byte of the OSD pixel data for the current OSD region is read from the memory, the next OSD header is read  and the process is repeated up  through and including the<br>
 last OSD region for the current frame.<br>
Those skilled in the art will realize that the order of constructing  and retrieving  the  OSD  bitstream  as  discussed  above can be modified.    For example, the OSD header can be read from the memory as the processor is formatting the OSD data, or the<br>
OSD data can be processed and displayed as OSD messages by the OSD unit without having to retrieve the entire OSD bitstream.<br>
Since OSD pixel data is superimposed on the decoded image, the  mixer  170  serves  to  selectively blend or multiplex the decoded image with the OSD pixel data.    Namely, the mixer 170<br>
has the capability to display at each pixel location, an OSD pixel, a pixel of the decoded image or a combination (blended) of both types of pixels.    This capability permits the display of Closed Captioning (OSD pixel data only) or the display of transparent channel logos (a combination of both OSD pixels and decoded image pixels) on a decoded image.<br><br>
7	RCA 88,22<br>
Video decoder  160 and OSD unit  150 both form streams or<br>
sequences   of  digital   words  representing  respective   luminance   and chrominance  components.     These  sequences  of video  component representative  digital  words  are coupled  via mixer  170  to  a digital-to-analog  converter (DAC)   185.     The luminance  and chrominance   representative   digital   words   are   converted   to   analog luminance  and  chrominance  signals  by  the  respective  sections  of the DAC.<br>
The OSD unit 150 can be used to display a user defined bit map  over  any part of the displayable  screen,  independent of the size and location of the active video area.    This bit map can be defined independently  for each field  and  specified as  a collection of OSD regions.    A region is often a rectangular area specified by its boundary and by a bit map defining its contents.    Each region has associated with it a palette defining a plurality of colors (e.g., 4 or 16 colors) which can be used within that region.    If required, one of these colors can be transparent, allowing the background to show  through  as  discussed  above.<br>
However, handling the OSD functions for a frame increases the  computational  overhead  of the  processor   130  and,  more importantly,   places   severe   strains  on. the  memory  bandwidth   of the  processor  because  the  processor   130  must  service  memory requests from both the video decoder  160 and the OSD unit  150. As such, the present invention reduces the size of the OSD bitstream by  implementing the Compressed Pixel Mode.<br>
FIG.  2 illustrates the  structure of a sample "compressed pixel" OSD bitstream 200.    The OSD bitstream comprises a plurality of OSD headers 210, each followed by OSD data 220.    In one embodiment,  the  header is  comprised  of five  64-bit  words, followed by any number of 64-bit OSD data (bit map) words.    The OSD header 210 contains information relating to the OSD region coordinates  214,  the various entries of the palette 216 for a particular OSD region, and various function codes (bits) 212. Those skilled in the art will realize that the OSD header can be of any length.     A longer header can provide more information  and options, e.g., a palette with more entries, but at the expense of<br><br>
8	<br>
incurring  a higher  computational  overhead,  i.e.,  more  read  and<br>
write cycles.    In fact, the content of the OSD header is illustrative of a particular embodiment and is not limited to the  specific arrangement as illustrated in FIG.  2.<br>
	The OSD region coordinates 214 contain the positions of the<br>
left and right edge of an OSD region, i.e., row start and stop positions  and column start and stop positions.     For interlaced display,  the  region  coordinates  include  the positions  (pointers)  of the top and bottom field pixel bit maps for the corresponding OSD<br>
region.    Finally, the OSD region coordinates 214 include a pointer to the next header block in the memory.<br>
The palette 216  contains  a plurality of entries where  each entry  contains   a  representation  of  chrominance  and  luminance levels for an OSD pixel.    The palette information 216 is used to<br>
 program the OSD palette.    Since each OSD header contains palette information  216,  the  available  colors  can be  selectively  changed for each OSD header and its associated OSD data bytes.    In the preferred  embodiment,  each  palette  entry  contains   16  bits  of data, i.e., six (6) bits of luminance, Y, four (4) bits of blue chrominance,<br>
 Cb and four (4) bits of red chrominance, Cr.    The remaining two bits  are  used  to implement various  display options  that are irrelevant  to  the  present invention.     In  one  embodiment,  there  are 16 entries in the palette requiring 4 bits  to address each entry.<br>
The function codes (bits) 212 contain information relating to various modes,  including but not limited to,  display options  and OSD bitstream  options.     In the preferred embodiment,  the  function bits contain a single bit to indicate whether the "Compressed Pixel Mode" is enabled.    When the "Compressed Pixel Mode" is enabled, the data in the OSD data contains a plurality or "runs" of "one-bit"<br>
 pixels  as  discussed below.<br>
The OSD data 220 contains the bit map in left to right and top to bottom order.    The OSD data is used to define the color index of each pixel.    In the preferred embodiment, if "Compressed Pixel Mode" is enabled, then the OSD data 220 contains an index<br>
i byte 230 which is followed by a plurality of data bytes 240.    The length of the index byte 230 and data bytes 240 are set at 8 bits<br><br>
9	<br>
for each byte.    The index 230 contains the addresses for two (2)<br>
particular palette entries  having  a 4-bit address.     As  such,  by setting each data bit in the OSD data 220 to a high or low value, one of the two available index addresses can be accessed easily using a single bit or a "one-bit" pixel.<br>
Furthermore,  the Compressed Pixel Mode allows  a user to specify a "run" of one-bit pixels.    A run length counter informs the OSD unit as to how many one-bit pixels there are in each run.    The run length count is written in the OSD header.<br>
To illustrate, FIG. 2 shows an index byte 230 having a first index  232  and a  second index  234,  where the indices represent the palette entries 5  and  12 respectively.     If the most significant bit (msb) of each OSD pixel byte corresponds to the first pixel out, then if a bit is "1", the most significant four bits 232 of the index byte are sent to address the palette.    If a bit is "0", then the least significant four bits 234 of the index byte are sent to address  the palette.     Furthermore,  if the compressed run  length  count equal twenty, then the next three data bytes 240 following the index byte contain those twenty "one-bit" pixels.    At the end of each run, the following byte must be the next index byte, followed by the next run.<br>
This mode of operation allows the processor 130 to gain a 4:1   compression ratio  over the normal display mode that uses  four bits to address the palette.    The saving is more significant for decoding  systems  that incorporate  larger palettes.     In  this Compressed Pixel Mode, only two colors can be selected at a time for a given run.    However, since application like Closed Captioning only employs two colors for a given character,  the Compressed Pixel Mode decreases  the number of memory operations  without limiting the display capabilities of a particular OSD implementation.     Additionally,  the  processor can  easily  change  the two color selections by simply changing the color index 230 at the end of a run,  thereby permitting color changes.    Finally, although the Compressed Pixel Mode is selected for an OSD header 210, the OSD unit supports multiple header blocks which can each have a<br><br>
10	<br>
different resolution mode.    Thus, the OSD unit is able to display<br>
different types  of resolution  or formats  on  the  same video  screen. The selection of the Compressed Pixel Mode is controlled by the user via the processor  130.    This control can be implemented<br>
using  software  that  detects  the  need  to  minimize  memory  access by the OSD unit 150.    For example, the video decoder 160 may receive  a  series  of complicated  encoded  frames  that require additional memory  access.    To minimize memory access  conflicts between the OSD unit and the video decoder, the processor can<br>
"offset the increased demand of the video decoder by  enabling  the Compressed Pixel Mode in the OSD bitstream.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a method 300 for constructing an OSD bitstream having a plurality of one-bit pixels.    The OSD bitstream is generated by the processor  130 and is processed by the OSD<br>
unit 150.    Method 300 constructs an OSD bitstream of FIG. 2 by generating an OSD header having a compressed pixel mode bit, followed by a plurality of index and data bytes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the method 300 begins at step 305 and proceeds to step 310 where a bit in the OSD header is designated<br>
as a compressed pixel mode bit.    If the compressed pixel mode is enabled in the OSD header, then the OSD data bits following the header are one-bit pixels.    If the compressed pixel mode is not enabled, then the OSD data bits are treated in accordance with a normal format, which may be a 4-bit address  to a palette (or any other bitstream formats,  e.g.,  the  MPEG  standards).<br>
In   step  320,   method  300  determines  whether  the compressed pixel mode is enabled.     If the query is negatively answered, method 300 proceeds to step 325 where the OSD data bytes  are  generated  using  a  non-compressed  format.     Method  300<br>
"then proceeds to step 370.<br>
If the  query  at  step  320  is  affirmatively  answered,  method 300 proceeds  to step 330 where a "run length count"  is written to the OSD header.    The "run length count" represents a run of one-bit pixels in the OSD data bytes and is used to initialize a run<br>
length   counter.<br><br>
1 1	.    P.CA 88,227-<br>
In  step  340,  method  300  generates  an  index  byte  having<br>
two indices  that identify two possible entries  in  a palette located in the OSD header.    The two indices are selected for the entire run. In  step  350,  method 300 generates  a run of one-bit pixels<br>
disposed within the OSD data bytes.    Although each OSD data byte has a length of 8-bits, the run length is not restricted to any length, i.e.,  a run of twenty one-bit pixels can be disposed within three OSD data bytes.<br>
In   step   360,  method  300  determines  whether  there  are  any<br>
"additional runs.    A new run may be required if the selected two colors  are modified.     If the query is  negatively  answered,  method 300 proceeds to  step  370.     If the  query is  affirmatively  answered, method  300 proceeds  to  step  330  where  the  steps  of 330-350  are repeated for each additional run.    The indices within the index<br>
byte can  be selectively modified for each run.<br>
In   step  370,  method  300  determines  whether  there  is another OSD header.    A new OSD header may be required if the selected colors in the palette and the various modes represented by the function bits 212 are modified.    Similarly, a new header is<br>
required for each new OSD region on a frame.    If the query is negatively   answered,  method  300  proceeds  to  step  380  where method  300  ends.     If the  query  is  affirmatively  answered,  method 300 proceeds  to  step  320 where the  steps of 320-360  are repeated for each additional OSD header.    In this manner, the OSD<br>
bitstream may comprise, both  compressed OSD data bytes  and non-compressed  OSD  data bytes.<br>
There has  thus been  shown  and described  a novel  method and apparatus for constructing an OSD bitstream having a plurality  of  one-bit  pixels  that  provides  improved  memory<br>
bandwidth  utilization  within   a  decoding/displaying   system.     Many changes,  modifications,  variations  and  other  uses  and  applications of the  subject invention will,  however, become  apparent to  those skilled in the art after considering  this  specification  and  the accompanying   drawings  which   disclose   the  embodiments   thereof. All  such  changes,  modifications,  variations  and other uses  and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the<br><br>

9.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein said storage medium is a<br>
random access memory (RAM).<br><br>
15<br>
10.Apparatus (100) for generating an OSD message comprising:<br>
a storage medium (140) for storing an OSD bitstrearn (200) having a header comprising a bit for indicating one of a compressed pixel mode and a non-compressed pixel mode and OSD data (220) coupled to said header, wherein when the bit in the OSD header indicates the compressed pixel mode, the OSD data comprises an index byte containing addresses and a plurality of one-bit pixels, each pixel indicating one of said addresses, and when the bit in the OSD header indicates the non-compressed mode, the OSD data comprises a plurality of non-compressed pixels;<br>
a processor (130), coupled to said storage medium, for programming a compressed pixel mode bit within said header to indicate said compressed pixel mode and for formatting said OSD data using said plurality of one-bit pixels; and<br>
an OSD unit (450), coupled to said processor, for processing said OSD bitstream to form the OSD message by selecting one of said addresses in response to each one of said one-bit pixels.<br><br>
Method and apparatus for generating an OSD message by constructing an OSD bitstream (200) having a plurality of "one-bit" pixels. The OSD bitstream contains an OSD header (210) and OSD data (220). An OSD unit (100) retrieves pixel control information from the OSD header which is programmed by a processor (130) of a decoding/displaying system. The OSD header contains information that is used to program a color palette of the OSD unit (ISD) and to provide instructions, as to the treatment of the OSD data. If the "Compressed Pixel Mode" is enabled in the OSD header, then the OSD unit will treat each bit of the OSD data as a "one-bit" pixel.</td>
