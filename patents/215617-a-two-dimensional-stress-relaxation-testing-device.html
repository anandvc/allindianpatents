				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a two-dimensional stress relaxation testing device.<br>
This device has potential industrial application for selecting right kind of materials by analysing their behaviour under different simulated stress-strain conditions while producing various value added products. It has thus enormous potential for the purpose of quality control as well as materials management in respect of such prominent industries as leather products, footwear, textile, polymeric industry to name but a few.<br>
Several sheet materials like polymeric materials, leathers , textiles, engineering composite materials etc. are being widely used in several engineering environments. As reported by Ramanathan et al (Journal of the Indian Leather Technologists Association, 16 , 293, 1968), these materials undergo various stresses in mutually perpendicular directions while in use for different applications. For example, the upper leather of a shoe is subjected to force in all directions. Ramanathan et al (Proceedings of the International Southern Biomedical Engineers Conference, Shrevepor, Louisiana, USA , 1982) reported that the force on the surface of the upper portion of the leather is enormous while walking. Moreover, with the advent of fashions several combination of materials are being used in shoe manufacture. It is therefore necessary to understand the mechanical properties, stress relaxation, hysteresis and mechanism of failure of these materials by simulating the user conditions for efficient use of these materials.<br>
Presently the viscoelastic nature of the materials are analysed using unidirectional testing by Universal Testing Machines (UTM), where a dumbbell shaped sample<br><br>
gripped by two jaws is pulled apart using motorised crosshead till the sample fails. As reported by Ridge and Wright (Biorheology, 2 ,67,1964), Muthiah et al (Biorheology, 4 ,185,1967), the force generated per unit area during the deformation, which eventually leads to the fracture of the sample, is usually taken as a measure of the tensile strength of the material under consideration. In addition, the gradual decrease in the force, developed during deformation, to a given strain level, viz., stress relaxation, provides information on the rearrangements of the molecular structure, which depends on the viscous nature of the samples, as reported by Arumugam et al (Handbook of Advanced Materials Testing , Edited by N P Cheremisinoff and P N Cheremisinoff, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, p 909, 1995). Similarly repeated deformations upto a certain strain level and back provide information about the plasticity of the sample, as reported by Vogel (Bioengineering and Skin , 4, 75,1988). As reported by Arumugam (Studies on the structural and mechanical properties of collagenous materials, Ph.D. Thesis submitted to the University of Madras, 1989) and Arumugam et al (Journal of Biosciences, 19, 307,1994), all these characteristics depend on the rate at which the experiments are performed.<br>
The use of unidirectional sample and the failure in one direction does not simulate the application conditions. This is because of the fact that the high Poisson's ratio of many viscoelastic materials does not permit deduction of realistic information about these materials from such tests. For example, there is tremendous amount of lateral contraction due to the high Poisson's Ratio of the leather while testing the sample in the conventional UTMs. Therefore, the extension and the breaking load observed for the sample under uni-directional test conditions are very different from those in a shoe<br><br>
undergoing a similar kind of stress during usage. Moreover, intermediate conditions of testing and the formation of surface cracks and their role in hastening or delaying failure during application cannot be studied. In addition, there are inherent inhomogeneities in certain materials like leather, textiles etc., which necessitates performing uniaxial testing in more than one direction to get a complete understanding of the material properties.<br>
No prior art is available on the use of a device to analyse stress relaxation behaviour of a material in two mutually perpendicular directions.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a two-dimensional stress<br>
relaxation testing device, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device to analyse stress<br>
related behaviour of materials  simultaneously     in two  mutually perpendicular<br>
directions.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a device to perform<br>
dynamic testing of materials<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to reduce the number of test<br>
sample and time as well as labour while analysing the stress related   properties of<br>
materials.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to to provide a device study the<br>
mechanical properties of sheet materials without any lateral contraction.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to to provide a device study and develop theoretical model for stress relaxation when the lateral contraction is not present.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification,<br>
Fig.l represents the elevation of the device of the present invention and<br>
Fig.2 represents the plan of the device of the present invention<br>
Various components, as shown with numerals in the Figure 1 as well as Figure 2 of<br>
the drawings accompanying this specification are the following.<br>
1	refers to the driving source.<br>
2	refers to the shaft connected to the driving source.<br>
3	refers to the grippers.<br>
4	refers to the slide ways, on which the grippers slide away from each other.<br>
5	refers to the arms connecting the shaft and the grips.<br>
6	refers to the specimen to be tested.<br>
7	refers to the force detector and<br>
8	refers to the attached output device.<br>
Thus the device of the present invention comprises essentially of a forearm mechanism which gets the drive from a driving source to move two pairs of grippers away from each other on slide ways.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a two dimensional stress relaxation testing device, which comprises of two pairs of juxtaposed grippers(3), mutually perpendicular to each other for holding the test specimen (6), each gripper being provided with a thimble to eliminate any slackness while testing, the grippers being driven over four slideways (4), away from each other, through forearm linkage mechanism, each arm (5) displacing one gripper slide in horizontal plane, while the drive being fed by a shaft (2) from a driving source(l) and the force generated thereby being detected by four force detectors (7) mounted on a clamp, displaying the output in an output device (8), connected to an interface. In an embodiment of the present invention, the driving source may be such as D.C.(Direct Current) motor, hydraulic drive, pneumatic drive.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the speed of separation of grips may be in the range of 0.01mm to 1000 mm per second.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the gauge length used along two perpendicular axes may be at least 5 mm.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the grips used may be selected from the group consisting of mechanical, electrical, pneumatic grips.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the control mechanism for the movement of the grips may be selected from gear assembly, hydraulic drive, pneumatic drive In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the force detectors may be selected from force transducers, strain gauges<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the output device used may be selected from the group consisting of a computer interface, digital display, analog output, chart recorder.<br>
The device has two pairs of juxtaposed grippers(3), mutually perpendicular to each other for holding the test specimen. The grippers are designed to move away from each other on mutually perpendicular linear motion slideways. Each gripper slide is provided with a thimble to eliminate any slackness in the specimen before initiating the experiment. The test sample (6) is held by the grippers (3) and is stretched at a rate ranging from 0.01mm to 1000 mm per second in equal amounts along two mutually perpendicular directions. The drive to the gripper slides is provided by a driving source (1) through a vertical shaft (2) and a forearm linkage (5) mechanism, each arm displacing one gripper slide in the horizontal plane. The force generated is detected and measured by the force detectors (7), which send the output to output device. The simultaneous measurement of the force in the two mutually perpendicular directions gives the two dimensional stress relaxation. The loss of energy owing to the repeated stress or strain cycling of the sample can also be computed from the hysteresis loop obtained on the output device.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in using two pairs of juxtaposed grippers, mutually perpendicular to each other for holding the test specimen , thereby enabling the simultaneous measurement of stress related properties, especially stress relaxation of materials, avoiding the factor of Poisson's ratio, in mutually perpendicular directions while simulating the near exact application conditions of different materials of multifarious characteristics.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
A plus shaped test sample of length 20 mm in both the mutually perpendicular directions was cut with a die from a cow upper leather and the same was gripped to the device with the help of four mechanical grippers. The test sample was strained at 1 mm/min speed by using a DC motor as the driving source to 20% level and then the machine was switched off. The sample was allowed to relax for a period of 3 hours, while continuously monitoring the force, which was displayed on the monitor of a computer terminal in graphical form.<br>
Example-II<br>
A plus shaped test sample of length 40 mm in both the mutually perpendicular directions was cut with a die from a goat upper leather and the same was gripped to the device with the help of four mechanical grippers. The test sample was strained at 5mm / min speed by using a hydraulic drive to 30% level and was again brought back immediately to the original condition of 0% strain at the same speed. Again the sample was strained at same speed and the process was repeated for 100 times. Finally the machine was switched off at the 0% strain level of the sample. Hysteresis loops of all the cycles were obtained on the recorder.<br>
Example - III<br>
A plus shaped test   sample   of length 50 mm in both the mutually perpendicular directions was cut with a die from a polyethylene film and the same was gripped to<br>
the device with the help of four mechanical grippers. The test sample was strained at 50mm / min speed by using a DC motor as the driving source to 80% level and then the machine was switched off. The sample was allowed to relax for a period of 2 hours, while continuously monitoring the force on the sample which was displayed on the monitor of a computer terminal in graphical form.<br>
Example - IV<br>
A plus shaped test   sample   of length 70 mm in both the mutually perpendicular<br>
directions was cut with a die from a textile material and the same was gripped to the<br>
device with the help of four pneumatic grippers.   The test sample was strained at<br>
1000mm / min speed by using a pneumatic drive to 20% level and then the machine<br>
was switched off. The sample was allowed to relax for a period of 5 hours, while<br>
continuously monitoring the force on the sample which was displayed on the monitor<br>
of a computer terminal in graphical form.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are the following.<br>
I.It is possible to study the stress relaxation behaviour as well as hysteresis of<br>
different materials in two mutually perpendicular directions simultaneously, thereby<br>
reducing the number of test samples and testing time required thereof.<br>
2. Stress relaxation experiments can be carried out without subjecting the test sample<br>
to lateral contractions, thereby overcoming the limitation encountered in the materials<br>
with high Poisson's ratio in connection with the simulation to the actual working<br>
conditions.<br>
3.It is possible to study the role of fiber orientation in the   stress relaxation and<br>
dynamic testing conditions, especially in materials having no or very little Poisson's<br>
ratio.<br>
4.It is also possible to study the fatigue and flexing properties of sheet materials,<br>
polymeric materials and leather.<br>
5. The shape deformation in sheet materials, biological materials and leather for a<br>
given stress can be studied in this instrument.<br><br><br><br>
