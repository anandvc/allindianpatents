				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to pallet containers for transport and storage of liquids, with a flat pallet, an interchangeable inner container of plastic with upper, scalable fill opening and lower drain means as well as an outer jacket which surrounds the inner container and which consists of vertical and horizontal lattice bars of metal, which support the liquid-filled plastic inner container, the lattice rods which are made as pipes being indented at the intersections for formation of cavity-shaped, double-walled depressions which run in the longitudinal direction of the. lattice rods such that at each intersection between the longitudinal edges of the depressions of two lattice rods which lie at right angles on top of one another four contact points are formed with one material accumulation each which corresponds to four times the thickness of the lattice rod wall, and the four contact points of the two lattice rods are welded to one another at the intersections.<br>
The weld connections at the intersections of the vertical and horizontal lattice rods of the lattice jacket of pallet containers of this type known from DE 38 39 647 C2 are exposed to static bending stresses as a result of stacking loads when several containers are stacked and pulsating bending stresses during transport caused by surge vibrations which originate from the liquid in the plastic inner container and which are transmitted via the fiexible jacket of the inner container to the lattice jacket, and driving vibrations transferred through the transport vehicle, and to impact and shock<br><br><br>
stress can lead to fracture of the welds at the intersections of the lattice rods of the lattice jacket so that the requires stacking and transport safety of the pallet container is no longer ensured.<br>
The object of the invention is to increase the durability of the welds at the intersections of the vertical and horizontal lattice rods of the lattice jacket of the generic pallet container by relieving static and dynamic loads in operation and thus to improve the stacking and transport safety of the container.<br>
By means of the shaping of the horizontal and vertical lattice rods according to the invention at their intersections in a pallet container with a lattice jacket and plastic inner container which forms bending points of limited elasticity in the area of the welds of the lattice rods at the intersections, during transport the welds are for the most part relieved of the static bending stresses and dynamic bending stresses which occur during stacking so that a major improvement of the durability of the welds of the lattice rods of the lattice jacket and thus increased operating safety of the pallet container compared to the known containers is achieved.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a pallet container for transporting and storing of liquids, having a flat pallet, an exchangeable inner container made of plastic material with an upper, closeable filler opening and a lower emptying device and also, surrounding the inner container, one outer sleeve which consists of vertical and horizontal lattice bars made of metal which support the plastic inner container filled with liquid, the lattice bars which are configured as tubes being indented at the intersection points to form trough-like, double-walled recesses extending in<br><br>
the longitudinal direction of the lattice bars in such a manner that at each intersection point between the longitudinal edges of the recesses of two lattice bars lying perpendicularly one above the other there arise four contact points with a material accumulation respectively corresponding to the quadruple lattice bar wall thickness, and the four contact points of two lattice bars being welded together at the intersection points characterised in that the trough-like recesses of the vertical and horizontal lattice bars have a central raised part extending across the cross-section of the recesses, two lattice bars respectively lying one above the other at the intersection points are welded together at the four contact points of these raised parts and the incisions of the recesses of the lattice bars adjacent on both sides to the raised part with the contact and weld points form restrictedly elastic bending points with a reduced bending resistance moment relative to the raised part for relieving the weld joints at the intersection points upon application of static and/or dynamic pressure on the lattice sleeve.<br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TFIE INVENTION<br>
Pallet container i used as a returnable and non-returnable container according to Figure I for transport and storage of liquids as main components has interchangeable cuboidal inner container 2 of polyethylene with rounded comers, which is equipped with filler neck 3 which can be closed with screw cover 4 and drain nozzle 5 with bleeder cock 6 as well as drain bottom 7, outer jacket 8 of intersecting vertical and horizontal lattice rods 9, 10 of metal, sheet metal pallet 11 made as flat bottom tray 12 with Eurostandard length and width dimensions for form-fit accommodation of plastic irmer container 2, and upper frame 13 of diagonally arranged pipe braces for stiffening of lattice jacket 8 and for protection of inner container 2.<br>
Vertical and horizontal lattice rods 9, 10 support outer wall 14 of liquid-filled inner container 2 and form continuous outer and inner boundary planes so that "climbing" of pallet containers 1 standing next to one another due to distortion of the stowage surface during transport of the containers, for example, with a truck, is precluded.<br>
At intersections 15 vertical and horizontal lattice rods 9, 10 are<br><br><br>
longitudinal direction of the rods and which have a kidney-like cross sectional shape. Cavity-like depressions 16 have center elevation 17 (Figures 2 - 4). At each intersection 15 between longitudinal edges 18, 19 of center elevations 17 of cavity-shaped depressions 16 of two lattice rods 9, 10 which lie at right angles on top of one another, this shaping of lattice-rods 9, 10 results in formation of four contact points 20 which lie in one plane, each with a material accumulation which corresponds to four times the wall thickness 21 of the lattice rods (Figures 5 - 7). Center elevations 17 of 'depressions 16 which are indented into lattice rods 9, 10 are dimensioned such that initial measure A which is measured in the direction of the normal through intersections 15 before welding of joined lattice rods 9, 10 is greater than one outside diameter 22 of the lattice rod (Figure 6). Lattice rods 9, 10 are joined to one another at intersections 15 each in the area of four contacts points 20 by electrical resistance pressure welding such that initial measure A is reduced under pressure to fmal measure E which corresponds to one outside diameter 22 of the lattice rod and lattice rods 9, 10 have tommon tangential planes 23-23 and 24-24 inside and outside (Figure 7).<br>
The accumulation of material of four times the thickness 21 of the lattice rod wall at each of four contact points 20 at all intersections 15 of vertical and horizontal lattice rods 9, 10 of outer jacket 8 results in that for corresponding control of the welding current and pressure of the welding press a current flows via contact points 20 which produces uniform melt pools which are limited to the contact points and which ensure homogenous welds at intersections 15 between lattice rods 9, 10.<br>
.Sections 25, 26 of cavity-like depression 16 of lattice rods 9, 10, the sections adjacent on each side to elevation 17 with four contact and welding points 20, form bending points of limited elasticity with a bending resistance moment which is reduced relative to elevation 17 to relieve the<br><br>
welds at intersections 15 of vertical and horizontal lattice rods 9, 10 under static or dynamic loading of lattice jacket 8.<br>
In possible electrical spot welding of lattice rods 9, 10 at intersections 15 the thickness measurement of intersections 15 which is measured perpendicularly to the plane of lattice jacket 8 corresponds roughly to measure A which is shown in Figure 6 and which is somewhat greater than outside diameter 22 of lattice rods 9, 10 so that the inner and outer boundary planes of vertical and horizontal lattice rods 9, 10 are offset slightly parallel to the inside and outside. However this has no adverse effect on preventing the "climbing effect" of pallet containers standing next to one another during transport which was mentioned in the introductory part of the description.<br><br><br>
