				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention, in general relates to Multi Functional Peripherals. Particularly the invention relates to embedded system and more particularly to a method for finding statistics of usage of features provided by MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Mostly all networked MFPs include variety of features like Scanner, Copiers, S2E, Network Scan, Scan to USB, Fax, Delay Fax etc. As of now there are not many facilities in MFP to know the consumption of resources like paper, toner and the details of each feature that the MFP provides. The present invention puts an effort to solve the problem by providing a count value with every usage of feature and its options and automatically generate a report and send it to the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can use those inputs in designing future products. Such Reports can even be sent to the administrator so that the consumption of resources can be monitored.<br>
In patent no. US20060112432A1, titled, "System and method for tracking feature usage in a document processing environment", the invention describes a method for monitoring and tracking of the usage of features, services or functions that are available to users on document processing devices. The features to be tracked, the time period, and the frequency of tracking these features are set by an administrator according his preferences. The feature usage report is generated in<br>
 <br>
a structure predefined by the administrator. The generated report is accessed in the form of an email, an internet web page, or a hard copy.<br>
In another patent no. US20040012644A1, titled," Printer", the invention describes a method for generating a usage report of consumables and printer settings in a printer A user may select various settings available on the printer, such as type of paper, print quality, type of printing, etc. A report corresponding to these settings is stored in non-volatile memory storage. Also, the report is updated periodically. The stored report in the form of a web page or a message is displayed on a PC. However, the publication focuses the concept of report generation based on settings selected by a user for a printer, and not for MFPs in general.<br>
Yet another patent numbered GB2387004A and titled," Determining an optimal use of printing devices", describes an optimization program for a multifunction device/printer. According to the method, a data of available options and installed options is maintained for the printer, and printer usage is monitored based on number of received jobs, job quantity, etc. Then, the optimization program suggests optimizations for the printer. However, suggesting or alerting a user regarding low usage for a particular option has not been explicitly disclosed.<br>
The article titled," Total Print Management-Understand your printer Usage", describes a concept of identifying the features being used in multifunction devices. According to the article, the usage features such as color usage, media usage, duplex or simplex printing, copy, scan, fax usage, total pages printed, etc.<br>
 <br>
can be tracked. The device can be scheduled to generate online or real time reports on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Also, the report may be sent to the users in the organization in the form of an email.<br>
The concept of monitoring usage of features and options provided by a device such as an MFP has been disclosed in patent publications US20060112432A1, US20040012644A1, GB2387004A, and the article titled Total Print Management-Understand your printer Usage'. The concept of generating customizable reports on daily/weekly/monthly basis and sending them as an email has also been disclosed in the patent publication US20060112432A1 and the article. Report generation at a job level and page level separately has not been explicitly mentioned in these publications. Alerting a user regarding low usage for a particular feature/option has not been disclosed in these publications; however, GB2387004A discloses the concept of an optimization program that suggests optimizations for a printer based on the printer's usage data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposed invention describes a method and system for finding the statistics of usage of features provided by MFP. The MFP provides a lot of features like ScanToEmail, NetScan, Print, etc. The usage of features and the variation of the features by the options provided with them vary with respect to every user. For e.g. scan has lot of variation like enlarge, reduce, poster, Clone, etc. The disclosure maintains a count on the options used thus tries to find which feature is<br>
 <br>
mostly used and based on it automatically generate a report and send it to Administrator or send a mail to manufacturer so that the manufacturer can know the feature usage statistics and design the future products. This automation of report containing the feature usage can be set to be generated when the number of usage count has hit some pre-defined value or on a monthly basis or weekly basis or any customized way.<br>
A method for finding the statistics of usage of various features in MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
maintaining a count for each feature and its options ;<br>
generating a usage report of each feature and its options reflecting the used<br>
count; and<br>
sending the said report to a desired destination.<br>
The report gets generated when the feature or the options usage count crosses a pre-defined value. The MFP is adapted to generate the report in a monthly, weekly or in a customized configured way. The count for each feature gets incremented with usage of the specific feature to get the used count for feature. The count for each option of a feature gets incremented with the usage of the specific option of the feature to get the used count for option. The report is send to the desired destination by e-mail. A usage report is generated for the features alone or options alone or for a combination of both feature and option.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly this invention provides a system for finding the statistics of usage of various features comprising:<br>
a counter for maintaining a count for each feature and its options ;<br>
means for generating a usage report of each feature and its options reflecting<br>
the used count; and<br>
means for sending the said report to a desired destination.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
