The present invention relates to neurologically-<br>
active compounds, processes for their preparation and<br>
their use as pharmaceutical or veterinary agents, in<br>
particular for the treatment of neurological conditions,<br>
more specifically neurodegenerative conditions such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
All references, including any patents or patent<br>
applications, cited in this specification are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. No admission is made that any<br>
reference constitutes prior art. The discussion of the<br>
references states what their authors assert, and the<br>
applicants reserve the right to challenge the accuracy and<br>
pertinency of the cited documents. It will be clearly<br>
understood that, although a number of prior art<br>
publications are referred to herein, this reference does<br>
not constitute an admission that any of these documents<br>
forms part of the common general knowledge in the art, in<br>
Australia or in any other country.<br>
The life span is thought to be biologically fixed for<br>
each species, and the length of the human life span is<br>
uncertain, but may be up to 120 years. Since life<br>
expectancy has risen significantly in this century, the<br>
elderly are an increasing segment of our population, and<br>
their health care needs will continue to grow for decades.<br>
Although normal aging is characterized by modest<br>
reductions in the mass and volume of the human brain,<br>
which may be due to the atrophy and/or death of brain<br>
cells, these changes are far more profound in the brains<br>
of patients who succumb to a neurodegenerative condition.<br>
Most of these conditions are sporadic (i.e., not due to<br>
genetic mutations) and of unknown cause, but hundreds of<br>
different mutations in many genes have been shown to cause<br>
familial (inherited) variants of several neurodegenerative<br>
conditions. Many of the dozen or more genes that harbor<br><br>
these mutations were discovered in the quest to determine<br>
the genetic basis of neurodegenerative conditions just in<br>
the last ten years. Neurodegenerative conditions evolve<br>
gradually after a long period of normal brain function,<br>
due to progressive degeneration (i.e., nerve cell<br>
dysfunction and death) of specific brain regions. Since<br>
symptomatic expression of disease occurs when nerve cell<br>
loss exceeds a "threshold" for the continuing function<br>
(e.g., memory, movement) performed by the affected brain<br>
region, the actual onset of brain degeneration may precede<br>
clinical expression by many years.<br>
Intellectual and higher integrative cognitive<br>
faculties become progressively impaired and interfere with<br>
activities of daily living in neurological conditions<br>
resulting in dementia. The precise prevalence of dementia<br>
in the elderly population is unknown, but may be 15% of<br>
people over 65 years old with 5% severely and 10% mildly<br>
to moderately demented. The prevalence of severe dementia<br>
increases from 1% at 65 years to 45% at 85 years. There<br>
are many causes of dementia, but Alzheimer's Disease (AD)<br>
accounts for 50% of demented patients over 65 years of<br>
age.<br>
AD is a primary degenerative disease of the brain.<br>
It is characterized by progressive decline of cognitive<br>
functions such as memory, thinking, comprehension,<br>
calculation, language, learning capacity and judgement.<br>
Dementia is diagnosed when these declines are sufficient<br>
to impair personal activities of daily living. AD shows<br>
an insidious onset with slow deterioration. This disease<br>
needs to be clearly differentiated from age-related normal<br>
decline of cognitive functions. The normal decline is<br>
much less, much more gradual and leads to milder<br>
disabilities. The onset of AD is usually after 65 years<br>
of age, although earlier onset is not uncommon. As age<br>
advances, the incidence increases rapidly (it roughly<br>
doubles every 5 years). This has obvious implications for<br>
the total number of individuals living with this disorder<br>
as life expectancy increases in the population.<br><br>
The aetiology of dementia of AD is unclear. There is<br>
considerable evidence of a heritable predisposition for<br>
some forms of AD (reviewed in St George-Hyslop, 2000), and<br>
the expression of certain isoforms of ApoE has also been<br>
linked to a higher risk of AD (Corder et al, 1993; Czech<br>
et al 1994). The toxic accumulation of aluminium has been<br>
suggested as a causative agent in AD, although this<br>
hypothesis has now been largely superseded. The brains of<br>
AD patients, display abnormal deposits which include β-<br>
amyloid protein (Ap) .<br>
Aβ is known to be present in the brains of<br>
individuals with certain neurodegenerative diseases, but<br>
it is not known whether it is symptomatic of an underlying<br>
disease process, or is actually involved in the aetiology<br>
of the disease. For example, some authors believe that<br>
the Aβ deposits may be indicative of a normal brain<br>
defence mechanism, in which the brain attempts to<br>
sequester the Aβ; such deposits can be present in the<br>
brains of normal individuals. There is a mutation of tau<br>
protein in which neurofibrillary tangles, but no amyloid<br>
plaques are present in the brain; this condition is known<br>
as tauopathy.<br>
One proposed approach to AD therapy is to inhibit<br>
production of Aβ in the brain. Proteolytic cleavage of<br>
APP by BACE1 and γ-secretase generates the full-length Aβ,<br>
which is then released from cells (Nunan and Small, 2000).<br>
Therefore inhibitors of either BACE1 or γ-secretase may be<br>
of therapeutic value. Alternatively, a number of studies<br>
have shown that cholesterol can influence Aβ release<br>
(Simons et al., 1998; Hartmann, 2001; Fassbender et al.,<br>
2001; Frears et al., 1999; Friedhoff et al., 2001).<br>
However, there is some disagreement in the art as to the<br>
value of lowering cholesterol levels, and some workers<br>
consider that cholesterol is actually beneficial. For<br>
example, Ji et al, (2002) have suggested that the binding<br>
of Aβ to cholesterol might prevent Aβ toxicity by<br>
inhibiting its oligomerization.<br><br>
In an alternative approach, it has been proposed that<br>
by unravelling the proteolytic processing of the amyloid<br>
precursor protein (APP), which generates the Aβ amyloid<br>
monomer, a number of possible therapeutic targets may be<br>
possible (Shearman et al., 2000; Sinha et al., 1999), and<br>
this approach is in an early stage of clinical<br>
development. Attempts to promote the clearance of Aβ from<br>
the brain through immunization with Aβ, while efficacious<br>
in a transgenic mouse model for AD (Schenk et al 1999),<br>
have been found to have significant adverse effects<br>
(Brower, 2002).<br>
It has also been suggested that deposition of<br>
amyloid-like fibrils may also be important in other<br>
neurodegenerative diseases. These include Parkinson's<br>
disease, dementia with Lewy body formation, multiple<br>
system atrophy, Hallerboden-Spatz disease, and diffuse<br>
Lewy body disease.<br>
One of the competing theories of the aetiology of AD<br>
is that the causative step(s) lies within the pathway of<br>
the intracerebral biogenesis and accumulation of the Aβ<br>
amyloid protein (see recent reviews by Selkoe, 2001;<br>
Beyreuther et al., 2001; Bush, 2001). However, to date no<br>
drugs or agents which target this pathway have been<br>
demonstrated to have a lasting effect on modifying the<br>
clinical expression of the disease or in preventing or<br>
ameliorating the decline in cognitive function associated<br>
with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's<br>
disease.<br>
A further hypothesis is that AD is caused by the<br>
toxic accumulation of Aβ amyloid, due in part to excess<br>
binding of copper and zinc, metal ions which are abundant<br>
in the regions most affected. Moreover, it has been<br>
suggested that when Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions interact with Aβ,<br>
aggregation of Aβ into fibrils and plaques occurs (Atwood<br>
et al., 1998); confirmed by recent data from animals<br>
deficient in synaptic Zn2+ (Lee et al., 2002). It has also<br>
been suggested that redox-active Cu2+-Aβ interactions can<br>
generate H202 from 02 (Huang et al., 1999). Both Cu2+ and<br><br>
Zn2+ have been shown to affect Aβ-lipid membrane<br>
interactions (Curtain et al., 2001).<br>
The brain is an organ that concentrates metal ions<br>
and recent evidence suggests that a breakdown in metal<br>
homeostasis plays a critical role in a variety of age-<br>
related neurodegenerative diseases. Common features of<br>
these diseases include the deposition of misfolded protein<br>
(each disease has its own specific amyloid protein) and<br>
substantial cellular damage as a result of oxidative<br>
stress. Indeed data is now rapidly accumulating that<br>
metallochemical reactions could emerge as the common<br>
denominator underlying amyloidogenic neurological<br>
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, amylotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis (ALS), prion diseases - including<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), transmissible spongioform<br>
encephalopathies (TSE), cataracts, mitochondrial<br>
disorders, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.<br>
In these instances, the pathological aggregation of a<br>
specific protein is promoted by abnormal redox activity in<br>
a physiological environment typified by the presence of<br>
transition metals and available reducing agents. [Bush,<br>
2000 (Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2000 Apr; 4(2) :184-91)] .<br>
A method of treatment of AD using<br>
iodochlorohydroxyquinoline an antibiotic [also known as<br>
clioquinol (CQ)], is disclosed and claimed in US patent<br>
Nos. 5,994,323 and 6,001,852 by P.N. Geromylatos S.A. and<br>
in US patent application No. 09/972,913 by Bush et al. CQ<br>
was withdrawn as an antibiotic in 1970, because of its<br>
association with an uncommon neurological syndrome,<br>
subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON), which was observed<br>
only in Japan in the 1960s, in patients thought to have<br>
received the drug over long periods and probably at doses<br>
higher than those recommended at the time (Shiraki, 1975).<br>
However, recent evidence suggests that SMON was caused by<br>
an overuse-related vitamin B12 deficiency in an<br>
exceptionally vulnerable population, and therefore could<br>
be rehabilitated for study in a clinical setting (Yassin<br>
et al., 2000; Bush and Masters, 2001).<br><br>
However, no in vivo results in animal models or in<br>
humans are provided in the Geromylatos and Bush patents.<br>
US 5,994,323 discloses a composition comprising CQ and<br>
Vitamin B12, and its use for the treatment of "diseases or<br>
disorders responsive to CQ administration while inhibiting<br>
detrimental side effects" of CQ. These diseases include<br>
AD. US 6,001,852 discloses a method of treatment of AD<br>
using CQ, preferably together with Vitamin B12. Both US<br>
5,994,323 and US 6,001,852 suggest a dosage of 10-750 mg<br>
per day; US 5,994,323 recommends that if treatment is over<br>
a long period CQ should be given intermittently, for up to<br>
3 weeks at a time followed by a "wash-out" period of 1-4<br>
weeks.<br>
In US application No. 09/972,913 CQ is exclusively<br>
referred to in terms of its ability to disaggregate Aβ<br>
deposits. No other mechanism of neurotoxicity is<br>
discussed. PCT/US99/05291 by General Hospital Corporation<br>
discloses the use of CQ in combination with specific<br>
copper and zinc chelators to promote dissolution of<br>
amyloid plaques and inhibition of amyloid plaque formation<br>
and/or the production of ROS by Aβ.<br>
US 6,001,852 also suggests that a composition<br>
comprising CQ and Vitamin B12 could be used in the<br>
treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, in this context<br>
it is suggested that CQ acts primarily via clearing iron<br>
from the substantia nigra.<br>
The efficacy of CQ in the treatment of AD rests upon<br>
its ability to enter the CNS and then sequester the<br>
transition metals Cu, Zn and Fe from various Ap entities<br>
thereby reducing Aβ toxicity and liberating it for<br>
clearance. The effectiveness of CQ is restricted by its<br>
poor aqueous solubility which limits its. oral<br>
bioavailability. CQ is also known to undergo considerable<br>
conjugative metabolism and has a history of toxicity as<br>
discussed above. The fact that CQ is a bidentate metal<br>
ligand makes necessary the commitment of at least two<br>
molecules for every metal ion captured.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides a means of treating<br>
neurological conditions including those characterised by<br>
the abnormal reaction between proteins and metals.<br>
International Patent Publication No. WO2004/031161<br>
describes heterocyclic compounds having two fused 6-<br>
membered rings with a nitrogen at position 1 and a hydroxy<br>
or mercapto group at position 8 with at least one ring<br>
being aromatic. These compounds are useful as<br>
pharmaceutical or veterinary agents, in particular for the<br>
treatment of neurological conditions, more specifically<br>
neurogenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.<br>
We have now developed heterocyclic compounds having<br>
two fused 6-membered rings with nitrogen atoms at<br>
positions 1 and 3, a carboxy group at position 4 and a<br>
hydroxy group at position 8 with both rings being aromatic<br>
through the collective optimization of one or more of the<br>
following properties:<br>
(a)	metal chelation (as hereinafter defined);<br>
(b)	aqueous solubility;<br>
(c)	reduced cell toxicity;<br>
(d)	amyloid dispersion properties;<br>
(e)	membrane permeability appropriate for CNS<br>
penetration; and<br>
(f)	metabolic stability.<br>
These compounds fall within the generic scope of<br>
International Patent Publication No. 2004/031161, but are<br>
not specifically disclosed therein and include examples of<br>
therapeutics which are concentrated in the CNS through<br>
active transport, contain antioxidant activity in addition<br>
to their metal chelation properties which in some cases<br>
leads to enhanced metal chelation properties and<br>
demonstrate a prodrug strategy which masks the 8-hydroxy<br>
moiety to favour CNS penetration and make use of the known<br>
esterase activity which resides on the inner surface of<br>
the blood brain barrier (BBB).<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is<br>
believed that the nature of the substituents at positions<br><br>
2 and 3 may be important in enhancing plaque<br>
disaggregation. It is preferable that these substituents<br>
are planar in 3D terms. Planar substituents on the ring<br>
system allow both the free ligand and the metal chelate to<br>
more effectively interact with, and disaggregate, the<br>
plaques.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided<br>
a compound of the formula I<br><br>

is not C2-4 alkyl,<br>
salts, hydrates, solvates, derivatives, pro-drugs,<br>

The invention still further provides a process for<br>
the preparation of the compound of formula I defined above<br>
which comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) reacting an optionally protected compound of formula<br>
v<br><br>
in which R5 and R7 are as defined above with H2NR3 in which<br>

We have also found a less complex process for<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the subject specification, except where the<br>
context requires otherwise due to express language or<br>
necessary implication, the words "comprise" or variations<br>
such as "comprises" or "comprising" are used in an<br>
inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the<br>
stated features but not to preclude the presence or<br>
addition of further features in various embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in the subject<br>
specification, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the"<br>
include plural aspects unless the context clearly dictates<br>
otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a compound"<br>
includes a single compound, as well as two or more<br>
compounds; and so forth.<br>
A preferred compound of formula I is a compound of<br>
formula IA:<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R5, R7 and X are as defined in formula I above,-<br>
and.<br>
R3A is optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl;<br>
optionally substituted C2-4 alkenyl; an optionally<br>
substituted saturated or unsaturated 5- or 6-membered N-<br>
containing heterocyclyl optionally condensed with an<br>
optionally substituted 6-membered aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
(CH2)nR6 in which n is 1 to 3 and R6 is optionally<br>
substituted C3-6 cycloalkyl or an optionally substituted<br>
saturated or unsaturated 5- or 6-membered N-containing<br>

substituted C1_4 alkyl or optionally substituted 6-membered<br>
aryl .<br>
Preferably R5 and R7 are both halo, more preferably<br>
chloro.<br>
Illustrative examples of compounds of formula IA are<br>
shown below.	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the illustrative examples of the compounds of<br>
formula IA, compounds 1076, 1077, 1082, 1083, 1084, 1085,<br>
1087, 1088, 1089, 1091, 1092, 1093, 1097, 1098, 1099,<br>
1100, 1101, 1107, 1108, 1109, 1110, 1112, 1115 and 1126<br>
possess planar substituents at position 3, such as,<br>
optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl; optionally substituted<br>
C1-4 alkenyl; optionally substituted saturated or<br>
unsaturated 5- or 6-membered N-containing heterocyclyl<br>
optionally condensed with an optionally substituted 6-<br>
membered aryl, (CH2)nR6 in which n is 1 to 3 and R6 is<br>
optionally substituted C3-6 cycloalkyl or an optionally<br><br>
substituted saturated, or unsaturated 5- or 5-membered N-<br>
cotnaining heterocyclyl; and NR8R9 in which R8 is H and R5<br>
is H or optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl or optionally<br>
substituted 6-membered aryl. Of these planar compounds of<br>
formula IA, compounds 1100 and 1101 also possess very good<br>
disaggregation.<br>
Another preferred compound of formula I is a compound<br>
of formula IB:<br><br>
in which R2, R5, R7 and X are as defined in formula I<br>
above.<br>
Preferably R2 is CH2NR1R4- in which R1 and R4 are<br>
independently selected from H, optionally substituted C1-6<br>
alkyl and optionally substituted C3-6 cycloalkyl.<br>
Preferably R5 and R7are both halo, more preferably<br>
chloro.<br>
Illustrative compounds of formula IB are shown below.<br><br>
Both of the illustrative examples of formula IB<br>
possess planar substituents at position 2, such as,<br>
CH2NR1R4 in which R1 and R4 are independently selected from<br><br>
optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl. Compound 1128 also<br>
possesses very good disaggregation.<br>
A further subclass of the compound of formula I is a<br>
compound of formula IC:<br><br>
in which<br>
R5, R7 and X are as defined in formula I above; and<br>
R1C is CH2NR1R4 in which R1 and R4 are independently<br>
selected from H and optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl; and<br>
R3c is optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl.<br>
Preferably R5 and R7 are both halo, more preferably<br>
chloro.<br>
Illustrative compounds of formula IC are shown below.<br><br><br>
The 8-hydroxyl group on the compounds of formula I<br>
may be blocked to form a prodrug, in particular an ester<br>
prodrug. The 8-hydroxy represents a principal site of<br>
metabolism for the compound of formula I: conjugation with<br>
glucuronic acid or sulphate gives a hydrophilic species<br>
ready to be excreted. Such conjugates probably do not<br>
pass the blood brain barrier. The ester prodrug may<br>
protect the compound of formula I from conjugation.<br>
Esterases integral to the blood brain barrier may then<br>
release the C8-hydroxy on passage through that barrier<br>
activating the compound for its role in the CNS.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that substituents R3 and R5 generally have a<br>
limited effect, electronically or sterically, in the<br>
chelating properties of the compounds of the present<br>
invention. Substitution can therefore be used to modulate<br>
other parameters such as cytotoxicity and physicochemical<br>
properties including the number of hydrogen bond donors<br>
and acceptors, lipophilicity (ClogP, ElogP and LogD),<br>
solubility and polar surface area. Modulation of these<br>
parameters contribute to the optimisation of the<br>
pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds. It is also<br>
postulated that when substituents R2 and R7 in addition to<br>
modulating cytotoxicity and physicochemical properties<br>
could also affect activity if the substituent provides<br>
chelating properties.<br>

groups, such as a hydroxy, amino, carbonyl or carboxy<br>
group, unreactive under selected conditions and which may<br>
later be optionally removed to unmask the functional<br>

temporarily render a hydroxy group unreactive. A hydroxy<br>
protecting group refers to a hydroxy group which has<br>
temporarily been rendered unreactive by a hydroxy<br>
protecting group. A protected phenyl group is taken to be<br>
one in which attached reactive substituents, such as OH,<br>
NH2, are protected by a protecting group. Suitable<br>
protecting groups are known in the art and are described<br>
in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition,<br>
T.W. Greene and P.G. White, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999,<br>
(the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference) as are methods for their installation and<br><br>
removal. Examples of protecting groups which may be used<br>
to protect a hydroxy group include, but are not limited<br>
to, silyl groups (eg trimethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl,<br>
t-butyldiphenylsilyl), benzyl groups (eg benzyl,<br>
methoxybenzyl, nitrobenzyl), alkyl groups (eg methyl,<br>
ethyl, n- and i-propyl, and n-, sec- and t- butyl) and<br>
acyl groups (eg acetyl and benzoyl).<br>
The leaving group may be of any suitable known type,<br>
such as, for example, those leaving groups disclosed in J.<br>
March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms<br>
and Structure" 4th Edition, pp 352-357, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
New York, 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the leaving group is halogen.<br>
The term "metal chelator" is used herein in its<br>
broadest sense and refers to compounds having two or more<br>
donor atoms capable of binding to a metal atom, preferably<br>
Cu, Zn or Fe wherein at least two of the donor atoms are<br>
capable of simultaneous binding to the metal atom and the<br>
resultant metal complex has a thermodynamic stability<br>
greater than or equal to that of the metal ion: biological<br>
ligand complex. The use of metal chelators as treatments<br>
for neurological disorders in the present invention is<br>
distinguished from the previously known concept of<br>
"chelation therapy". "Chelation therapy" is a term<br>
associated clinically with the removal of bulk metals such<br>
as in Wilson's disease, -thallesemia and haemochromatosis.<br>
The break down in metal homeostasis in these diseases can<br>
be described as a catastrophic event much like a dam<br>
bursting leading to overwhelming flooding of the problem<br>
metal. The mechanism of action of such compounds is that<br>
bulk metal is sequestered by the chelators and cleared by<br>
excretion. By way of comparison the breakdown in metal<br>
homeostasis associated with neurological conditions of the<br>
present invention is more akin to the constant drip of a<br>
leaky tap, which if left long enough will eventually cause<br>
local damage over a long period of time. The intention of<br>
the "metal chelator" of the present invention is to<br>
disrupt an abnormal metal-protein interaction to achieve a<br><br>
subtle repartitioning of metals and a subsequent<br>
normalization of metal distribution with the aim that once<br>
the toxic cycle is short-circuited, endogenous clearance<br>
processes can cope more effectively with the accumulating<br>
amyloidogenic protein.<br>
The salts of the compound of formula I are preferably<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, but it will be appreciated<br>
that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall<br>
within the scope of the present invention, since these are<br>
useful as intermediates in the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable cations such as sodium,<br>
potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium and<br>
alkylammonium; acid addition salts of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inorganic acids such as hydrochloric,<br>
orthophosphoric, sulphuric, phosphoric, nitric, carbonic,<br>
boric, sulfamic and hydrobromic acids; or salts of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids such as acetic,<br>
propionic, butyric, tartaric, maleic, hydroxymaleic,<br>
fumaric, citric, lactic, mucic, gluconic, benzoic,<br>
succinic, oxalic, phenylacetic, methanesulphonic,<br>
trihalomethanesulphonic, toluenesulphonic,<br>
benzenesulphonic, salicylic, sulphanilic, aspartic,<br>
glutamic, edetic, stearic, palmitic, oleic, lauric,<br>
pantothenic, tannic, ascorbic and valeric acids.<br>
In addition, some of the compounds of the present<br>
invention may form solvates with water or common organic<br>
solvents. Such solvates are encompassed within the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>
Preferably the derivative is a "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative". By "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative" is meant any pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
hydrate, ester, ether, amide, active metabolite, analogue,<br>
residue or any other compound which is not biologically or<br>
otherwise undesirable and induces the desired<br>
pharmacological and/or physiological effect.<br><br>
The term "pro-drug" is used herein in its broadest<br>
sense to include those compounds which are converted in<br>
vivo to the compound of formula I. Use of the pro-drug<br>
strategy optimises the delivery of the drug to its site of<br>
action, for example, the brain. In one aspect, the term<br>
refers to the presence of a C1-6 alkyl or arylester moiety<br>
which is designed to resist hydrolysis until the pro-drug<br>
has crossed the BBB, where esterases on the inner surface<br>
of the BBB act to hydrolyse the ester and liberate the C8<br>
hydroxyl of the compound of formula I. In a second<br>
aspect, the term refers to the attachment at position 2 of<br>
an antioxidant group, in particular the 3,4,-<br>
5trimethoxyphenyl moiety or derivatives thereof. Exposure<br>
to the prooxidative environment of the brain will then<br>
lead to hydroxylation of the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl group<br>
to give a 2-hydroxy-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl substituent,<br>
the hydroxyl group of which acts to enhance the chelation<br>
properties of the compound of formula I.<br>
The term "antioxidant" is used herein in its broadest<br>
sense and refers to a group which has the capacity to<br>
react with a reactive oxygen species such as a hydroxyl<br>
radical in such a way as to generate a non toxic product.<br>
Examples include phenols such as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl<br>
and 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl, indole amines such as<br>
melatonin and flavonoids. Other examples may be found the<br>
literature (Wright, 2001; Karbownik, 2001; Gilgun-Sherki,<br>
2001).<br>
The term "tautomer" is used herein in its broadest<br>
sense to include compounds of formula I which are capable<br>
of existing in a state of equilibrium between two isomeric<br>
forms. Such compounds may differ in the bond connecting<br>
two atoms or groups and the position of these atoms or<br>
groups in the compound.<br>
The term "isomer" is used herein in its broadest<br>
sense and includes structural, geometric and stereo<br>
isomers. As the compound of formula I may have one or<br>
more chiral centres, it is capable of existing in<br>
enantiomeric forms.<br><br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise at<br>
least one compound of formula I together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and optionally other<br>
therapeutic agents. Each carrier, diluent, adjuvant<br>
and/or excipient must be pharmaceutically "acceptable" in<br>
the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients<br>
of the composition and not injurious to the subject.<br>
Compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal,<br>
nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal<br>
or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous and intradermal) administration. The<br>
compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage<br>
form and may be prepared by methods well known in the art<br>
of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing<br>
into association the active ingredient with the carrier<br>
which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In<br>
general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and<br>
intimately bringing into association the active ingredient<br>
with liquid carriers, diluents, adjuvants and/or<br>
excipients or finely divided solid carriers or both, and<br>
then if necessary shaping the product.<br>
The term "neurological condition" is used herein in<br>
its broadest sense and refers to conditions in which<br>
various cell types of the nervous system are degenerated<br>
and/or have been damaged as a result of neurodegenerative<br>
disorders or injuries or exposures. In particular,<br>
compound of formula I can be used for the treatment of<br>
resulting conditions, in which damage to cells of the<br>
nervous system has occurred due to surgical interventions,<br>
infections, exposure to toxic agents, tumours, nutritional<br>
deficits or metabolic disorders. In addition, the<br>
compound of formula I can be used for the treatment of the<br>
sequelae of neurodegenerative disorders, such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple<br>
sclerosis, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, drug<br>
abuse or drug addiction (alcohol, cocaine, heroin,<br>
amphetamine or the like), spinal cord disorders and/or<br>
injuries, dystrophy or degeneration of the neural retina<br><br>
(retinopathies) and peripheral neuropathies, such as<br>
diabetic neuropathy and/or the peripheral neuropathies<br>
induced by toxins.<br>
The term "neurodegenerative disorder" as used herein<br>
refers to an abnormality in which neuronal integrity is<br>
threatened. Neuronal integrity can be threatened when<br>
neuronal cells display decreased survival or when the<br>
neurons can no longer propagate a signal.<br>
Neurological disorders that can be treated with the<br>
compound of the present invention include acute<br>
intermittent porphyria; adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy;<br>
AIDS dementia and HIV-1 induced neurotoxicity; Alzheimer's<br>
disease; amylotrophic lateral sclerosis; atherosclerosis;<br>
cateract; cerebral ischaemia; cerebral palsy; cerebral<br>
tumour; chemotherapy-induced organ damage; cisplatin-<br>
induced nephrotoxicity; coronary artery bypass surgery;<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and its new variant associated<br>
with "mad cow" disease; diabetic neuropathy; Down's<br>
syndrome; drowning; epilepsy and post-traumatic epilepsy;<br>
Friedrich's ataxia; frontotemporal dementia; glaucoma;<br>
glomerulopathy; haemochromatosis; haemodialysis;<br>
haemolysis; haemolytic uraemic syndrome (Weil's disease);<br>
haemorrhagic stroke; Hallerboden-Spatz disease; heart<br>
attack and reperfusion injury; Huntington's disease; Lewy<br>
body disease; intermittent claudication; ischaemic stroke;<br>
inflammatory bowel disease; macular degeneration; malaria;<br>
methanol-induced toxicity; meningitis (aseptic and<br>
tuberculous); motor neuron disease; multiple sclerosis;<br>
multiple system atrophy; myocardial ischaemia; neoplasia;<br>
Parkinson's disease; peri-natal asphyxia; Pick's disease;<br>
progressive supra-nuclear palsy; radiotherapy-induced<br>
organ damage; restenosis after angioplasty; retinopathy;<br>
senile dementia; schizophrenia; sepsis; septic shock;<br>
spongiform encephalopathies; subharrachnoid<br>
haemorrage/cerebral vasospasm; subdural haematoma;<br>
surgical trauma, including neurosurgery; thalassemia;<br>
transient ischaemic attack (TIA); traumatic brain injury<br><br>
(TBI); traumatic spinal injury; transplantation; vascular<br>
dementia; viral meningitis; and viral encephalitis.<br>
Additionally, the compound of the present invention<br>
may also be used to potentiate the effects of other<br>
treatments, for example to potentiate the neuroprotective<br>
effects of brain derived nerve growth factor.<br>
The invention is particularly directed to conditions<br>
which induce oxidative damage of the central nervous<br>
system, including acute and chronic neurological disorders<br>
such as traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury,<br>
cerebral ischaemia, stroke (ischaemic and haemorragic),<br>
subharrachnoid haemorrage/cerebral vasospasm, cerebral<br>
tumour, Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and<br>
its new variant associated with "mad cow" disease,<br>
Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Friedrich's<br>
ataxia, cataract, dementia with Lewy body formation,<br>
multiple system atrophy, Hallerboden-Spatz disease,<br>
diffuse Lewy body disease, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis,<br>
motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, fatal familial<br>
insomnia, Gertsmann Straussler Sheinker disease and<br>
hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyoidoisis-Dutch<br>
type.<br>
More particularly, the invention is directed to the<br>
treatment of neurodegenerative amyloidosis. The<br>
neurodegenerative amyloidosis may be any condition in<br>
which neurological damage results from the deposition of<br>
amyloid. The amyloid may be formed from a variety of<br>
protein or polypeptide precursors, including but not<br>
limited to Aβ, synuclein, huntingtin, or prion protein.<br>
Thus the condition is preferably selected from the<br>
group consisting of sporadic or familial Alzheimer's<br>
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron<br>
disease, cataract, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob<br>
disease and its new variant associated with "mad cow"<br>
disease, Huntington's disease, dementia with Lewy body<br>
formation, multiple system atrophy, Hallerboden-Spatz<br>
disease, and diffuse Lewy body disease.<br><br>
More preferably the neurodegenerative amyloidosis is<br>
an Aβ-related condition, such as Alzheimer's disease or<br>
dementia associated with Down syndrome or one of several<br>
forms of autosomal dominant forms of familial Alzheimer's<br>
disease (reviewed in St George-Hyslop, 2000). Most<br>
preferably the Aβ-related condition is Alzheimer's<br>
disease.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of all aspects<br>
of the invention, prior to treatment the subject has<br>
moderately or severely impaired cognitive function, as<br>
assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale<br>
(ADAS)-cog test, for example an ADAS-cog value of 25 or<br>
greater.<br>
In addition to slowing or arresting the cognitive<br>
decline of a subject, the compound and methods of the<br>
invention may also be suitable for use in the treatment or<br>
prevention of neurodegenerative conditions, or may be<br>
suitable for use in alleviating the symptoms of<br>
neurodegenerative conditions. The compound may be able to<br>
provide at least a partial reversal of the cognitive<br>
decline experienced by patients. If administered to a<br>
subject who has been identified as having an increased<br>
risk of a predisposition to neurodegenerative conditions,<br>
or to a subject exhibiting pre-clinical manifestations of<br>
cognitive decline, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment or<br>
minimal progressive cognitive impairment, these methods<br>
and compounds may be able to prevent or delay the onset of<br>
clinical symptoms, in addition to the effect of slowing or<br>
reducing the rate of cognitive decline.<br>
Currently Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are<br>
usually not diagnosed until one or more warning symptoms<br>
have appeared. These symptoms constitute a syndrome known<br>
as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which was recently<br>
defined by the American Academy of Neurology, and refers<br>
to the clinical state of individuals who have memory<br>
impairment, but who are otherwise functioning well, and<br>
who do not meet clinical criteria for dementia (Petersen<br>
et al., 2001). Symptoms of MCI include:<br><br>
(1)	Memory loss which affects job skills<br>
(2)	Difficulty performing familiar tasks<br>
(3)	Problems with language<br>
(4)	Disorientation as to time and place (getting<br>
lost)<br>
(5)	Poor or decreased judgement<br>
(6)	Problems with abstract thinking<br>
(7)	Misplacing things<br>
(8)	Changes in mood or behaviour<br>
(9)	Changes in personality<br>
(10)	Loss of initiative<br>
MCI can be detected using conventional cognitive<br>
screening tests, such as the Mini Mental Status Exam, and<br>
the Memory Impairment Screen, and neuropsychological<br>
screening batteries.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein refers to any<br>
animal having a disease or condition which requires<br>
treatment with a pharmaceutically-active agent. The<br>
subject may be a mammal, preferably a human, or may be a<br>
domestic or companion animal. While it is particularly<br>
contemplated that the compound of the invention is<br>
suitable for use in medical treatment of humans, it is<br>
also applicable to veterinary treatment, including<br>
treatment of companion animals such as dogs and cats, and<br>
domestic animals such as horses, ponies, donkeys, mules,<br>
llama, alpaca, pigs, cattle and sheep, or zoo animals such<br>
as primates, felids, canids, bovids, and ungulates.<br>
Suitable mammals include members of the Orders<br>
Primates, Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Cetacea, Carnivora,<br>
Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla. Members of the Orders<br>
Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla are particularly preferred<br>
because of their similar biology and economic importance.<br>
For example, Artiodactyla comprises approximately 150<br>
living species distributed through nine families: pigs<br>
(Suidae), peccaries (Tayassuidae), hippopotamuses<br>
(Hippopotamidae), camels (Camelidae), chevrotains<br>
(Tragulidae), giraffes and okapi (Giraffidae), deer<br>
(Cervidae), pronghorn (Antilocapridae), and cattle, sheep,<br><br>
goats and antelope (Bovidae). Many of these animals are<br>
used as feed animals in various countries. More<br>
importantly, many of the economically important animals<br>
such as goats, sheep, cattle and pigs have very similar<br>
biology and share high degrees of genomic homology.<br>
The Order Perissodactyla comprises horses and<br>
donkeys, which are both economically important and closely<br>
related. Indeed, it is well known that horses and donkeys<br>
interbreed.<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" is meant an amount of a compound of the present<br>
invention effective to yield a desired therapeutic<br>
response, for example, to treat, ameliorate or prevent a<br>
neurological condition.<br>
The specific "therapeutically effective amount" will,<br>
obviously, vary with such factors as the particular<br>
condition being treated, the physical condition of the<br>
subject, the type of subject being treated, the duration<br>
of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if<br>
any), and the specific formulations employed and the<br>
structure of the compound or its derivatives.<br>
The compound of the present invention may<br>
additionally be combined with other medicaments to provide<br>
an operative combination. It is intended to include any<br>
chemically compatible combination of pharmaceutically-<br>
active agents, as long as the combination does not<br>
eliminate the activity of the compound of formula I or II.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compound of the invention<br>
and the other medicament may be administered separately,<br>
sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
Other medicaments may include, for example, where the<br>
condition is a (i-amyloid related condition, particularly<br>
Alzheimer's disease, an inhibitor of the<br>
acetylcholinesterase active site, for example phenserine,<br>
galantamine, or tacrine; an antioxidant, such as Vitamin E<br>
or Vitamin C; an anti-inflammatory agent such as<br>
flurbiprofen or ibuprofen optionally modified to release<br><br>
nitric oxide (for example NCX-2216, produced by NicOx) or<br>
an oestrogenic agent such as 17-p-oestradiol.<br>
Methods and pharmaceutical carriers for preparation<br>
of pharmaceutical compositions are well known in the art,<br>
as set out in textbooks such as Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 20th Edition, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Pennsylvania,<br>
USA.<br>
As used herein, a "pharmaceutical carrier" is a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or<br>
vehicle for delivering the compound of formula I or II to<br>
the subject. The carrier may be liquid or solid and is<br>
selected with the planned manner of administration in<br>
mind. Each carrier must be pharmaceutically "acceptable"<br>
in the sense of being compatible with other ingredients of<br>
the composition and non injurious to the subject.<br>
The compound of formula I may be administered orally,<br>
topically, or parenterally in dosage unit formulations<br>
containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles. The term<br>
parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous<br>
injections, aerosol for administration to lungs or nasal<br>
cavity, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal,<br>
intracranial, injection or infusion techniques,<br>
he present invention also provides suitable topical, oral,<br>
and parenteral pharmaceutical formulations for use in the<br>
novel methods of treatment of the present invention. The<br>
compounds of the present invention may be administered<br>
orally as tablets, aqueous or oily suspensions, lozenges,<br>
troches, powders, granules, emulsions, capsules, syrups or<br>
elixirs. The composition for oral use may contain one or<br>
more agents selected from the group of sweetening agents,<br>
flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents<br>
in order to produce pharmaceutically elegant and palatable<br>
preparations. Suitable sweeteners include sucrose,<br>
lactose, glucose, aspartame or saccharin. Suitable<br>
disintegrating agents include corn starch,<br>
methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, xanthan gum,<br>
bentonite, alginic acid or agar. Suitable flavouring<br><br>
agents include peppermint oil, oil of wintergreen, cherry,<br>
orange or raspberry flavouring. Suitable preservatives<br>
include sodium benzoate, vitamin E, alphatocopherol,<br>
ascorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben or sodium<br>
bisulphite. Suitable lubricants include magnesium<br>
stearate, stearic acid, sodium oleate, sodium chloride or<br>
talc Suitable time delay agents include glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl distearate. The tablets contain<br>
the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable<br>
for the manufacture of tablets.<br>
These excipients may be, for example, (1) inert<br>
diluents, such as calcium carbonate, lactose, calcium<br>
phosphate or sodium phosphate; (2) granulating and<br>
disintegrating agents, such as corn starch or alginic<br>
acid; (3) binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or<br>
acacia; and (4) lubricating agents, such as magnesium<br>
stearate, stearic acid or talc. These tablets may be<br>
uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay<br>
disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer<br>
period. For example, a time delay material such as<br>
glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be<br>
employed. Coating may also be performed using techniques<br>
described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,160,452; and<br>
4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control<br>
release.<br>
The compound of formula I as well as the<br>
pharmaceutically-active agent useful in the method of the<br>
invention can be administered, for in vivo application,<br>
parenterally by injection or by gradual perfusion over<br>
time independently or together. Administration may be<br>
intravenously, intraarterial, intraperitoneally,<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity,<br>
transdermally or infusion by, for example, osmotic pump.<br>
For in vitro studies the agents may be added or dissolved<br>
in an appropriate biologically acceptable buffer and added<br>
to a cell or tissue.<br><br>
Preparations for parenteral administration include<br>
sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and<br>
emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive<br>
oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate.<br>
Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous<br>
solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and<br>
buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium<br>
chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium<br>
chloride, lactated Ringer's intravenous vehicles include<br>
fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers<br>
(such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like.<br>
Preservatives and other additives may also be present such<br>
as, for example, anti-microbials, anti-oxidants, chelating<br>
agents, growth factors and inert gases and the like.<br>
Generally, the terms "treating", "treatment" and the<br>
like are used herein to mean affecting a subject, tissue<br>
or cell to obtain a desired pharmacologic and/or<br>
physiologic effect. The effect may be prophylactic in<br>
terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or<br>
sign or symptom thereof, and/or may be therapeutic in<br>
terms of a partial or complete cure of a disease.<br>
"Treating" as used herein covers any treatment of, or<br>
prevention of disease in a vertebrate, a mammal,<br>
particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the<br>
disease from occurring in a subject that may be<br>
predisposed to the disease, but has not yet been diagnosed<br>
as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting<br>
its development; or (c) relieving or ameliorating the<br>
effects of the disease, i.e., cause regression of the<br>
effects of the disease.<br>
The invention includes various pharmaceutical<br>
compositions useful for ameliorating disease. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions according to one embodiment of<br>
the invention are prepared by bringing the compound of<br>
formula I, analogues, derivatives or salts thereof, or<br>
combinations of the compound of formula I and one or more<br>
pharmaceutically-active agents into a form suitable for<br><br>
administration to a subject using carriers, excipients and<br>
additives or auxiliaries. Frequently used carriers or<br>
auxiliaries include magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide,<br>
lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, milk protein,<br>
gelatin, starch, vitamins, cellulose and its derivatives,<br>
animal and vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols and<br>
solvents, such as sterile water, alcohols, glycerol and<br>
polyhydric alcohols. Intravenous vehicles include fluid<br>
and nutrient replenishers. Preservatives include<br>
antimicrobial, anti-oxidants, chelating agents and inert<br>
gases. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include<br>
aqueous solutions, non-toxic excipients, including salts,<br>
preservatives, buffers and the like, as described, for<br>
instance, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th ed.<br>
Williams and Wilkins (2000) and The British National<br>
Formulary 43rd ed. (British Medical Association and Royal<br>
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 2002;<br>
http://bnf.rhn.net), the contents of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. The pH and exact concentration<br>
of the various components of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition are adjusted according to routine skills in<br>
the art. See Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological<br>
Basis for Therapeutics (7th ed. , 1985) .<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are preferably<br>
prepared and administered in dose units. Solid dose units<br>
may be tablets, capsules and suppositories. For treatment<br>
of a subject, depending on activity of the compound,<br>
manner of administration, nature and severity of the<br>
disorder, age and body weight of the subject, different<br>
daily doses can be used. Under certain circumstances,<br>
however, higher or lower daily doses may be appropriate.<br>
The administration of the daily dose can be carried out<br>
both by single administration in the form of an individual<br>
dose unit or else several smaller dose units and also by<br>
multiple administration of subdivided doses at specific<br>
intervals.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the<br>
invention may be administered locally or systemically in a<br><br>
therapeutically effective dose. Amounts effective for<br>
this use will, of course, depend on the severity of the<br>
disease and the weight and general state of the subject.<br>
Typically, dosages used in vitro may provide useful<br>
guidance in the amounts useful for in situ administration<br>
of the pharmaceutical composition, and animal models may<br>
be used to determine effective dosages for treatment of<br>
the cytotoxic side effects. Various considerations are<br>
described, e.g., in Langer, Science, 249: 1527, (1990).<br>
Formulations for oral use may be in the form of hard<br>
gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed<br>
with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be<br>
in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active<br>
ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as<br>
peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions normally contain the active<br>
materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the<br>
manufacture of aqueous suspension. Such excipients may be<br>
(1) suspending agent such as sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and<br>
gum acacia; (2) dispersing or wetting agents which may be<br>
(a) naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin; (b)<br>
a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty<br>
acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate; (c) a<br>
condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain<br>
aliphatic alcohol, for example,<br>
heptadecaethylenoxycetanol; (d) a condensation product of<br>
ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty<br>
acid and hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol<br>
monooleate, or (e) a condensation product of ethylene<br>
oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acids and<br>
hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
monooleate.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of<br>
a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension.<br>
This suspension may be formulated according to known<br><br>
methods using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents<br>
and suspending agents which have been mentioned above.<br>
The sterile injectable preparation may also a sterile<br>
injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic<br>
parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example,<br>
as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water.<br>
Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this<br>
purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including<br>
synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids<br>
such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of<br>
injectables.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be administered in<br>
the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small<br>
unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and<br>
multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a<br>
variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol,<br>
stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of formula I may also be presented for<br>
use in the form of veterinary compositions, which may be<br>
prepared, for example, by methods that are conventional in<br>
the art. Examples of such veterinary compositions include<br>
those adapted for:<br>
(a)	oral administration, external application, for<br>
example drenches (e.g. aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
solutions or suspensions); tablets or boluses;<br>
powders, granules or pellets for admixture with<br>
feed stuffs; pastes for application to the<br>
tongue;<br>
(b)	parenteral administration for example by<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous<br>
injection, e.g. as a sterile solution or<br>
suspension; or (when appropriate) by<br>
intramammary injection where a suspension or<br>
solution is introduced in the udder via the<br>
teat;<br><br>
(c)	topical applications, e.g. as a cream, ointment<br>
or spray applied to the skin; or<br>
(d)	intravaginally, e.g. as a pessary, cream or<br>
foam.<br>
Dosage levels of the compound of formula I of the<br>
present invention are of the order of about 0.5 mg to<br>
about 20 mg per kilogram body weight, with a preferred<br>
dosage range between about 0.5 mg to about 10 mg per<br>
kilogram body weight per day (from about 0.5 gms to about<br>
3 gms per patient per day). The amount of active<br>
ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials<br>
to produce a single dosage will vary depending upon the<br>
host treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
For example, a formulation intended for oral<br>
administration to humans may contain about 5 mg to lg of<br>
an active compound with an appropriate and convenient<br>
amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to<br>
95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms<br>
will generally contain between from about 5 mg to 500 mg<br>
of active ingredient.<br>
Optionally the compounds of the invention are<br>
administered in a divided dose schedule, such that there<br>
are at least two administrations in total in the schedule.<br>
Administrations are given preferably at least every two<br>
hours for up to four hours or longer; for example the<br>
compound may be administered every hour or every half<br>
hour. In one preferred embodiment, the divided-dose<br>
regimen comprises a second administration of the compound<br>
of the invention after an interval from the first<br>
administration sufficiently long that the level of active<br>
compound in the blood has decreased to approximately from<br>
5-30% of the maximum plasma level reached after the first<br>
administration, so as to maintain an effective content of<br>
active agent in the blood. Optionally one or more<br>
subsequent administrations may be given at a corresponding<br>
interval from each preceding administration, preferably<br>
when the plasma level has decreased to approximately from<br>
10-50% of the immediately-preceding maximum.<br><br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific<br>
dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a<br>
variety of factors including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health,<br>
sex, diet, time of administration, route of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and<br>
the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>

General experimental details<br>
2,4-Dichlorobenzoic acid (1-1) and 2,4-dichloro-6-<br>
nitrophenol (2-lB)were purchased from Aldrich. All<br>
reagents/reactants, unless otherwise stated, were sourced<br>
from Aldrich. 4-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylpyrazole, 2-amino-<br>
4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine, 4-chloromethyl-3,5-<br>
dimethylisoxazole and 2-chloromethyl-4-methylthiazole<br>
hydrochloride were purchased from Lancaster. (2-<br>
Aminomethyl)thiazole was prepared according to the<br>
literature.1 Solvents were analytical grade and used as<br>
supplied. THF was distilled from sodium and benzophenone<br>
under argon. 1H NMR spectra (δ, relative to TMS) were<br>
recorded on a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer unless<br>
otherwise indicated; J-Values are given in Hertz. Mass<br>
spectral data were recorded on a Micromass Quattro II mass<br>
spectrometer.<br>
A practical and concise synthesis of 4,6-dichloro-3-<br>
hydroxy-2-nitrobenzoic acid (1-6), a key intermediate used<br>
for the preparation of a range of 8-hydroxy-3H-quinazolin-<br>
4-ones and, specifically, for the synthesis of 5,7-<br>
dichloro-substituted derivatives, is shown in Scheme 1A.<br>
Hence, according to Goldstein and Schaaf,2<br><br><br>
commercially available 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (1-1) is<br>
nitrated to give 2,4-dichloro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (1-2).<br>
Compound 1-2 is converted, via the amine 1-3 and the<br>
acetamide 1-4, into 3-acetamido-4,6-dichloro-2-<br>
nitrobenzoic acid (1-5) . Subsequent base hydrolysis of 1-5<br>
gives, following workup with acid, the 2-nitrobenzoic acid<br>
1-6. All steps proceed in high yields (about 90%) and are<br>
amendable to scale-up. Compound 1-6 can also be produced<br>
according to the route shown in Scheme 1B. Thus,<br>
diazotisation of 1-3 via standard or routine conditions3<br>
gives the alcohol 1-7. Compound 1-7 is then nitrated<br>
according to the conditions previously described in the<br>
literature4 to provide 1-6. The synthetic routes shown in<br>
both Schemes 1A and 1B for the preparation of 1-6<br>
represent improvements on the literature4 method, with all<br>
steps shown proceeding in good yields. Reduction of 1-6<br>
with iron powder in HOAc at 8 0°C for 45-50 minutes gives,<br>
after standard workup, the corresponding amine 1-8, in 94%<br>
yield. It is noteworthy that reduction of 1-5 via<br>
catalytic hydrogenation4 gave only a 14% yield of the amine<br>
1-8.<br><br>
A range of novel 8-hydroxy-3N-substituted quinazolin-<br>
4-ones of this invention can be synthesised according to<br>
the routes shown schematically in Scheme 2A.<br><br><br>
In process A (Scheme 2A) , the 2-nitrobenzoic acid 1-6<br>
can be first converted, via either 2-1 or 2-2 and 2-3,<br>
into the anthranilic acid 2-4.<br>
An alternate synthesis of 2-4 using standard<br>
procedures6 is shown in Scheme 2B. Thus, treatment of 2,4-<br>
dichloro-6-nitrobenzoic acid (2-1B) with dimethyl sulphate<br>
according to conditions previously described for the<br><br>
preparation of 2-2 from 1-6, gives 2-2B. Reduction of the<br>
nitro compound 2-2B under standard conditions, typically<br>
using tin(II) chloride or iron powder and glacial acetic<br>
acid/hydrochloric acid, gives the anisidine 2-3B.<br>
Treatment of the anisidine 2-3B with chloral hydrate in<br>
the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride followed by<br>
acid hydrolysis gives the isatin intermediate 2-4B.<br>
Subsequent treatment of 2-4B with hydrogen peroxide under<br>
basic conditions gives the anthranilic acid 2-4.<br><br>
Treatment of 2-4 with formamide at an elevated<br>
temperature, typically at 150°C, provides the 3H-<br>
quinazolin-4-one 2-5. Compound 2-5 is then reacted with<br>
the appropriate alkyl halide in the presence of a base,<br>
for example potassium carbonate, to give 2-6. Examples of<br>
alkyl halides that can be employed in process C include,<br>
but are not limited to, 2-(chloromethyl)pyridine,<br>
(chloromethyl)cyclopropane, 1-(2-chloroethyl)pyrrolidine,<br>
2- (2-chloroethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidine, 4- (2-<br>
chloroethyl)morpholine, 2-chloromethyl-4-methylthiazole<br>
hydrochloride, 2,6-bis(chloromethyl)pyridine, 2-<br>
bromopropane, 1-chloropropane, l-chloro-2-methylpropane,<br>
2-chloroethyl ethyl ether, (2-diethylamino)ethyl chloride<br>
hydrochloride, 1-chlorobutane, 2-chlorobutane, crotyl<br>
chloride and 4-chloromethyl-3,5-dimethylisoxazole. Results<br>
are tabulated (Table 1). Subsequent removal of the<br>
protecting group from 2-6, suitably using BBr3 or with<br>
aqueous HBr at an elevated temperature, provides the<br>
corresponding 3-N- (substituted)-8-hydroxy-3fl-quinazolin-4-<br>
one 2-7. In the case of the ethyl ether derivative 2-6M,<br>
the hydrobromide salt of the alcohol 2-7M1 was obtained<br>
(Table 2). Treatment of the alkene 2-6P with aqueous HBr<br><br>
resulted in hydrobromination of the alkenic double bond<br>
with concomitant removal of the methoxy protecting group<br>
giving compound 2-7P1.<br>
In processes B and C (Scheme 2A), the anthranilic<br>
acid 1-8 can be treated with acetic formic anhydride to<br>
give the formylamino compound 2-8 or the<br>
benzo[d] [1,3]oxazin-4-one 2-9. Compound 2-8 (or 2-9) is<br>
then reacted with a suitable amine in the presence of a<br>
condensing agent such as phosphorus trichloride or<br>
triethyl orthoformate at an elevated temperature,<br>
typically using toluene or xylene at near reflux<br>
temperature, to yield the 8-hydroxy-3H-quinazolin-4-ones<br>
2-7. Examples of amines that can be employed in processes<br>
B and C include, but are not limited to, 2-amino-5-<br>
methylthiazole, 2-(2-aminoethyl)pyridine, 3-aminopyridine,<br>
4-aminomorpholine, l-amino-4-methylpiperazine, 1-<br>
aminopyrrolidine, 4-(aminomethyl)piperidine, 1-<br>
aminopiperazine, 5-amino-l-ethylpyrazole, 5-amino-2-<br>
methoxypyridine, 4-amino-1,3,5-trimethylpyrazole, 2-amino-<br>
1-methylbenzamide, 2-amino-5-methylpyridine, 2-amino-5-<br>
chloropyridine and 4-aminopiperidine. Results are<br>
tabulated (Table 3). Other 8-hydroxy-3H-quinazolin-4-ones<br>
that can be prepared according to these processes are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br>
In process D (Scheme 2A), the 2-nitrobenzoic acid 1-6<br>
can first be treated with a suitable amine in the presence<br>
of an activating agent such as CDI to produce the<br>
appropriate N-(substituted)ben zamide 2—10. Subsequent<br>
reduction of the nitro group and coupling of the resultant<br>
amine 2-11, typically with formic acid in the presence of<br>
a condensing agent such as CDI or triethyl orthoformate or<br>
with formamide provides the corresponding 3-N-substituted<br>
derivative 2-7.<br>
Processes B and C (Scheme 2A) can be repeated<br>
utilizing a suitably O-protected anthranilic acid such as<br>
2-4 (Scheme 3). In these cases, the 8-hydroxy-3H-<br>
quinazolin-4-ones 2-7 are obtained following removal of<br>
the O-protecting group.<br><br><br>
2-Substituted 8-hydroxy-3H-quinazolin-4-ones can be<br>
prepared according to the routes depicted in Scheme 4.<br>
Hence, according to process E, treatment of the<br>
anthranilic acid 1-6 with an activating agent such as<br>
thionyl chloride and subsequent reaction of the<br>
intermediate acid chloride with ammonia gives the<br>
corresponding benzamide 4-1. Reduction of the nitro<br>
compound 4-1, typically with either SnCl2 or iron<br>
powder/HOAc, gives the corresponding amine 4-2. The amine<br>
4-2, in turn, can be treated with either chloroacetyl<br>
acetic acid or 2-chloro-l,1,1-trimethoxyethane to provide<br>
5,7-dichloro-2-chloromethyl-8-hydroxy-3H-quinazolin-4-one<br>
(4-3A) . The 2-chloromethyl compound can also be prepared<br>
from the methoxy anthranilic acid derivative 2-4 via<br>
process F. Thus, treatment7 of 2-4 with chloroacetonitrile<br>
in the presence of base, typically sodium methoxide, gives<br>
4-3B. Further elaboration of the 2-chloromethyl derivative<br>
4-3A (or 4-3B) with a range of amines such as, but not<br>
limited to, dimethylamine, methylamine and ethylamine,<br>
provides a number of novel 2-substituted derivatives 4-16A<br>
- 4-16D.<br>
A number of 2,3-disubstituted 8-hydroxy-3H-<br>
quinazolin-4-ones 4-9 can be prepared via the acid 2-1<br>
according to process G, as shown in Scheme 4. Hence, 2-1<br>
can be treated with a suitable amine in the presence of an<br>
activating agent to afford the corresponding benzamide 4-5<br>
which is then reduced, typically using SnCl2 or iron<br>
powder/HOAc, into 4-6. Compound 4-6 is subsequently<br>
transformed into the 2-chloromethyl derivative 4-7 and<br>
this, in turn, into 4-8 employing reaction conditions<br><br>
similar to those previously described in processes E and<br>
F. Following deprotection, typically employing aqueous HBr<br>
at near refluxing temperature, 4-8 provides the<br>
corresponding 2,3-disubstituted derivatives 4-9.<br>
2,3-Disubstituted 8-hydroxy-3fl-quinazolin-4-ones 4-9<br>
can also be accessed via processes H and I (Scheme 4). In<br>
process H, the anthranilic acid 1-8 is suitably acylated<br>
with a NP-containing acylating agent such as 2-azidoacetyl<br>
chloride, phthalyl-glycyl chloride and<br>
[(phenylmethyl)amino]acetyl chloride. Accordingly,<br>
examples of NP groups are azido, phthalimido and<br>
benzylamino. Subsequent condensation of the intermediate<br>
4-10 the presence of acetic anhydride at an elevated<br>
temperature, typically at near reflux temperature,<br>
furnishes the benzo[d][1,3]oxazin-4-one 4-11. In the<br>
presence of an appropriate amine (R1NH2) , 4-11 gives 4-12;<br>
4-12, in turn, gives 4-13 via a condensation. Suitable<br>
condensing agents include PC13, triethyl orthoformate, CDI<br>
and Ac2O. Conditions for the transformation of the -NP<br>
moiety into the amino group will depend on the particular<br>
NP group; for the abovementioned groups, these are<br>
respectively reduction, dimethylamine and catalytic<br>
hydrogenolysis (more examples of conditions5 for the latter<br>
two transformations can be found elsewhere). In process I,<br>
condensation of the anthranilic acid 1-8 with a suitable<br>
amine (NR1R2) affords the amide 4-14. Subsequent successive<br>
treatment of 4-14 with chloroacetyl chloride and an amine<br>
gives 4-9.<br><br><br><br><br>
3-Amino-5,7-dichloro-8-hydroxy-3H-quinazolin-4-one<br>
(5-4) and certain 3-(substituted)amino-3H-quinazolin-4-<br>
ones can be prepared according to routes shown in Scheme<br>
5. N-Formylation of the methyl ester 2-3, typically using<br>
acetic formic anhydride, provides 5-1. Alternatively,<br>
treatment of 2-3 with an orthoester such as triethyl<br>
orthoformate provides the imidate ester 5-2. Upon<br>
treatment with hydrazine, 5-1 or 5-2 yields the 3-amino-<br>
3H-quinazolin-4-one 5-3. Removal of the protecting group<br>
in 5-3, typically with aqueous HBr at 120°C, gives 5-4.<br>
Further elaboration of the 3-amino compound 5-4 using<br>
suitable acid halides provides the corresponding 3-<br>
substituted acylated derivatives, 5-5A -5-5C. Derivatives<br>
such as 5-7A - 5-7C can be obtained from 5-2 via<br>
substitution of hydrazine hydrate for the appropriately<br>
substituted hydrazine such as 4-fluorophenylhydrazine, 4-<br>
methoxyphenylhydrazine or 2,4-difluorophenylhydrazine,<br>
followed by deprotection. With alkyl halides in a suitable<br>
solvent, typically ethanol, followed by deprotection, 5-3<br>
provides compounds 5-7D - 5-7G. Alternatively, compounds<br>
5-7D - 5-7G can also be prepared via treatment of 5-2 with<br>
the appropriate alkylated hydrazine such as<br>
ethylhydrazine, propylhydrazine and<br>
(cyclopropyl)methylhydrazine.<br><br><br>
The amines 2-7F2, 2-7Q2, 2-7R2, 2-7S2 and 2-7X2 can<br>
be elaborated into a range of derivatives such as 6-1 - 6-<br>
6 via treatment with alkyl halides or acylating reagents.<br>
Data for 6-1 - 6-6 are tabulated (Table 9).<br>
A number of 3-substituted-3H-quinazolin-4-thiones 7-2<br>
can be prepared from the corresponding 3H-quinazolin-4-<br>
ones 2-6 according to the process shown in Scheme 6. Thus,<br>
treatment of 2-6 with either P4S10 or Lawesson's Reagent<br>
provides the thioketone 7-1. Subsequent removal of the<br>
protecting group, suitably using BBr3, gives the desired<br>
3-substituted-3H-quinazolin-4-thione 7-2.<br><br><br>

ether (3x). Some compounds were isolated as the free base:<br>
thus, saturated Na2CO3 (20 mL) was added and the mixture<br>
extracted with dichloromethane (5x). The combined extracts<br>
were washed with water, dried, and concentrated. The<br>

16 - 18 hours, and left to cool to room temperature. The<br>
reaction mixture was either concentrated to dryness or the<br>
precipitate which formed was isolated via filtration . The<br>
crude solid was then successively washed with diethyl<br>
ether, dichloromethane and acetonitrile, affording the<br>
corresponding 8-hydroxy compound (2-7) as the hydrobromide<br><br>
salt. Some compounds were isolated as the free base (see<br>

extracts combined and dried (Na2SO4). The volatiles were<br>
removed which afforded the 5,7-dichloro-8-hydroxy-3-<br>

Example 3 Preparation of 2,3-disubstituted-3H-<br>
quinazolin-4-ones (4-9)<br><br>
Step 1: To a solution of the acid 1-8 (1.00 g, 4.50<br>
mmol) in anhydrous benzene (8.3 mL) was added thionyl<br>
chloride (2.09 g, 17.6 mmol) dropwise under an argon<br>
atmosphere. The mixture was heated under reflux for 5 h<br>
after which time the excess thionyl chloride and benzene<br>
were removed by evaporation. The residue was dissolved in<br>
anhydrous dichloromethane (8.3 mL), cooled to 0°C, and<br>
treated with n-propylamine (798 mg, 13.5 mmol). The<br>
mixture was stirred at 0°C for 15 min, then warmed to room<br>
temperature and stirred for a further 16 h. Evaporation<br>
and purification of the crude residue via column<br>
chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether, 3:7 - 1:1)<br>
afforded the benzamide, 2-amino-4,6-dichloro-3-hydroxy-N-<br>
(n-propy) lbenzamide (4-14, R1 = n-propyl), as an orange<br>

mixture was heated under reflux for 2 h and then stirred<br>
at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was<br>
evaporated in vacuo and the residue neutralised with 2M<br><br>
NaOH. The precipitate was isolated via filtration, washed<br>
with water, and dried in vacuo. Dichloromethane (10 mL)<br>
was added to the resulting residue and the insoluble<br>
material was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated<br>
to afford the chloride, 2-chloromethyl-5,7-dichloro-8-<br>
hydroxy-3-n-propyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (4-15, R1 = n-<br>
propyl), as an orange solid (600 mg, 89%).<br>

methylamine in ethanol (7.5 mL of a 8.0M solution, 60<br>
mmol) dropwise under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 18 h, then concentrated,<br>
and to the resulting residue was added 2M HC1 (5 mL).<br>
The mixture was evaporated and more 2M HC1 (5 mL) was<br>
added. The residue was evaporated and the procedure<br>
repeated two more times. The mixture was triturated with<br>
dichloromethane and dried in vacuo to yield 5,7-dichloro-<br>
8-hydroxy-2-me thy laminomethy 1-3-n-propy 1-3H-quinazolint-<br>

3.39 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (14 mL). The solution was<br>
left to stir at RT for 20 h and heated under reflux for an<br>
additional 20 h. Evaporation and purification of the<br>
resulting residue via column chromatography (ethyl<br>
acetate/petroleum ether, 3:7) afforded the chloride 4-3B<br>
as a white solid (225 mg, 23%).<br>

A fluorometric assay was used to test the ability of<br>
a test compound to inhibit hydrogen peroxide generation by<br>
Aß in the presence of copper based on dichlorofluoroscein<br>
diacetate (DCF; Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). The DCF<br>
solution (5mM) in 100% dimethyl sulphoxide (previously<br>
purged with argon for 1hr at 20°C) was deacetylated in the<br>
presence of 0.025M NaOH for 30min and neutralised, at pH<br>
7.4 to a final concentration of ImM. Horseradish<br>
peroxidase(HRP) stock solution was prepared to 1µM at pH<br>
7.4. The reactions were carried out in PBS, pH 7.4 in a 96<br>
well plate (total volume =250µl/well). The reaction<br>
solutions contained AG 1-42 at concentrations in the range<br>
of 50nM to 1µM, copper-glycine chelate (Cu-Gly) , was<br>
prepared by adding CuCl2 to glycine in the ratio of 1:6 and<br>
added to the Aft in the proportion 2Cu-Gly : 1Aß ),<br>
reducing agents including dopamine (5µM) or ascorbic acid,<br>
deacetylated DCF 100µM, and HRP, 0.1µM. l-10µM EDTA or<br>
another chelator may also be present as a control for free<br>
copper, but was not required for the assay to function.<br>
The reaction mixture was incubated at 37C for 60 min.<br>
Catalase (4000 units/ml) and H2O2 (1-2.5µM) standards in<br>
PBS pH 7.4 may be included as positive controls.<br>
Fluorescence was recorded using a plate reader with<br>
excitation and emission filters at 485nM and 530nM<br>
respectively. H2O2 concentration may be established by<br>
comparing fluorescence with the H2O2 standards. Inhibition<br>
of Aft H2O2 production was assayed by including a given<br>
concentration of test compound(s) in the test wells.<br>

On completion of the assay, 1/10 volume MTS was added<br>
per well of plate (ie 25ul/ 250 ul) . The plates were<br>
incubated at 37°C for 2hrs, and then absorbance was read at<br>
5 60nm.<br>
Assay 4. Caspase Assay<br>
To measure caspase activity in neuronal cultures,<br>
growth medium is removed, cells are washed twice with<br>
control salt solution (pH 7.4) and ice-cold cell<br>
extraction buffer is added directly to the cultures. The<br>
extraction buffer consists of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM<br>
sucrose, 0.25 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM<br>
PMSF, 1% Triton X-100 (Tx-100) and 1 ng/mL of pepstatin<br>
and aprotinin. After incubation for 15 min on ice, the<br>
extraction buffer is removed, centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C<br>
in a microcentrifuge and 100 µL of supernatant is added to<br><br>
each well of a 96 well plate. 100 µL of 200 µM substrate<br>
(either DEVD-pNA, VEID-pNA or IETD-pNA for caspases 3, 6<br>
and 8 respectively) is added to each well to give a final<br>
concentration of 100 µM substrate. Plates are incubated<br>
at 37°C for 2, 4, 6 or 24 hr and the absorbance is<br>
determined at a wavelength of 415 nm (Abs415). The<br>
absorbance reading is compared to a known standard of pNA<br>
alone.<br>
Assay 5. Annexin V Assay<br>
To determine the level of annexin V binding to cells,<br>
cultures are washed twice with control salt solution (pH<br>
7.4) followed by the addition of annexin V-FITC at a<br>
concentration of approximately 0.5 µq/mL in control salt<br>
solution (pH 7.4). Propidium iodide (10 µg/mL) is also<br>
added to the cultures at the same time. Cells are<br>
incubated in the dark for 30 min at ambient temperature<br>
and subsequently washed three times with fresh control<br>
salt solution. Analysis of FITC fluorescence (ex. 488 nm,<br>
em. 510 nm) is determined using a Leica DMIRB microscope.<br>
Photographs are taken with a Leica MPS 60 camera<br>
attachment using ASA400 colour film, and negatives are<br>
scanned into Adobe Photoshop v2.0.1.<br>
Assay 6. Lipoprotein Oxidation Assay<br>
Two different assays of metal-mediated lipid<br>
peroxidation can be utilized. The first assay involves<br>
measuring the oxidative activity of metallated proteins.<br>
This is determined by mixing dialyzed metallated or native<br>
protein (at designated concentrations) with 0.5 mg/mL LDL<br>
for 24 hr (37°C) . Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is measured<br>
using a lipid peroxidation assay kit (LPO 486, Oxis<br>
International Inc. Portland, OR) as per kit instructions.<br>
The level of LPO is determined by comparing absorbance<br>
(486 nm) with LDL alone (100% LPO). The second assay is<br>
used to measure the LPO activity of native proteins in the<br>
presence of free, non-protein-bound Cu. This involves<br>
adding non-metallated peptides (140 µM) to 0.5 mg/mL LDL<br><br>
together with 20 µM Cu-gly and assaying for LPO as for the<br>
metallated proteins. The level of LPO is determined by<br>
comparing the absorbance (486 nm) with LDL + Cu-gly (100%<br>
LPO). As a negative control, LDL is also exposed to<br>
dialysed Cu-gly solutions comparable to those used to Cu-<br>
metallate the proteins.<br>
Assay 7. Cytotoxicity Induced by Cu-Metallated Proteins<br>
Proteins or synthetic peptides are mixed with metal-<br>
glycine solutions at equimolar or two-fold metal to<br>
protein concentration. Metal-protein mixtures are<br>
incubated overnight at 37°C and then extensively dialysed<br>
(24 hr against two changes of dH2O (3 L/change) at room<br>
temperature) using mini-dialysis cups with a 3,500<br>
kilodalton cut-off (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Dialysis of<br>
proteins against PBS pH 7.4 resulted in metallated<br>
proteins with identical activity to dH2O dialysis.<br>
To determine their neurotoxic effects, metallated<br>
proteins, native proteins or peptides are added to two<br>
day-old primary cortical neuronal cultures. The cultures<br>
are also exposed to Cu-gly (5 or 10 µM) or LDL. Positive<br>
control cultures are treated with Cu-gly + LDL or the LPO<br>
product, 4-hydroxy-nonenol (HNE, Sigma Chemicals).<br>
Cultures are assayed for cell death using the lactate<br>
dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit (Roche Molecular<br>
Biochemicals, Nunawading, Australia) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Assay 8. Acridine Orange Assay for Aβ-Mediated Loss of<br>
Lysosomal Acidification<br>
Cultured mouse cortical neurons are treated with Aβ1-<br>
42 (20µM) for 16 h and then stained with 5 mg/ml acridine<br>
orange (AO) for 5 min at 37°C. 15 min at 37°C. The AO-<br>
induced fluorescence is measured with a red filter on a<br>
fluorescence microscope. AO is a lysosomotropic weak base<br>
which accumulates in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments<br>
and displays orange fluorescence during incubation. AO is<br>
sequestered inside the lysosomes as long as there is a<br><br>
substantial proton gradient over the lysosomal membranes.<br>
Treatment of cells with Aβ1-42 disrupts the lysosomal<br>
membrane proton gradient and relocalises AO into the<br>
cytosol, as indicated by the loss of orange fluorescence<br>
within 16-24 hr.<br>
Assay 9. Human Brain Amyloid Solubilisation Assay<br>
This assay was performed in order to assess the<br>
ability of a test compound to mobilise Aβ from the<br>
insoluble to the soluble phase of an extract of tissue<br>
from post mortem human AD brain.<br>
Up to 0.5 g of plaque-bearing cortex without meninges<br>
was homogenized using a DIAX 900 homogenizer (Heudolph and<br>
Co, Kelheim, Germany) or other suitable device for three<br>
30-second periods at full speed in up to 2 ml of ice-cold<br>
phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. To obtain the<br>
phosphate-buffered saline-extractable fraction, the<br>
homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min and<br>
the supernatant removed. Alternatively, the tissue was<br>
freeze dried then pulverised to form a powder which was<br>
then weighed out into aliquots for extraction as above. A<br>
10µl aliquot of supernatant was removed after<br>
centrifugation and mixed with an equal volume of 2XTris-<br>
Ticene SDS sample buffer, pH 8.3, containing 8% SDS, 10%<br>
2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were then heated for 10 mins<br>
at 90DC and separated by gel electrophoresis. The<br>
insoluble fraction of the cortical samples was obtained by<br>
resuspending the initial pelleted sample in 1 ml of<br>
phosphate-buffered saline. A 50-µl aliquot of this<br>
suspension was then boiled in 200 ml of sample buffer as<br>
above.<br>
Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was<br>
performed by loading appropriately diluted samples on to<br>
10% to 20% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) followed<br>
by transfer on to 0.2-µm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-<br>
Rad,Hercules, CA). Aβ was detected by using monoclonal<br>
antibody W02, which detects residues 5 through 8, 17 (or<br>
another suitable antibody) in conjunction with horseradish<br><br>
peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako,<br>
Denmark), and visualized by using enhanced<br>
chemiluminescence (eg ECL; Amersham Life Science,<br>
Buckinghamshire, UK). Each gel included three lanes<br>
containing 0.5, 1, and 2 ng of synthetic Aβ40 (Keck<br>
Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT) as reference<br>
standards.<br>
Blot membranes were read using a suitable imager eg.<br>
Fuji LAS3000 and densitometry performed using suitable<br>
software, eg Multigauge. The linear range of signal<br>
intensity for densitometric analysis of the mono- and<br>
dimeric Aβ bands was established relative t known Aβ<br>
standards. The percentages calculated in Table 13<br>
represent the average readinds from the treatment mouse<br>
group relative to the vehicle treated mouse group.<br>
All samples were analysed several times, and gel<br>
loadings and dilutions were adjusted to fit within the<br>
quantifiable region of the standard curve. The insoluble<br>
Aβ being comprised of the pelletable fraction derived from<br>
the insoluble amyloid plaque from the above cortical<br>
samples and the soluble fraction comprising monomeric<br>
and/or oligomeric soluble Aβ.<br>
Several gels were run per test compound with a PBS<br>
control included on each gel. Each gel containing varying<br>
concentrations of the test compound. A student's 't test'<br>
was used to compare the mean of the highest value obtained<br>
by the test compound for each gel at any concentration, to<br>
the mean of the PBS values taken from the multiple gels.<br>
Accordingly a determination can be made of whether the<br>
average increase in solubilisation obtained by any test<br>
compound is significant compared with PBS alone. Test<br>
compounds with a (+) score are compounds which achieved a<br>
statistically significant increase in plaque<br>
solubilisation over that of PBS alone. A test compound<br>
with a (-) score is a compound which does not achieve a<br>
statistically significant increase in plaque<br>
solubilisation over that of PBS alone.<br><br>
Assay 10. Metal Partitioning<br>
To assay effects upon the partitioning of various<br>
metals, including zinc and copper, following extraction of<br>
brain tissue in the presence of a test compound, soluble<br>
and insoluble fractions from an extract of human brain<br>
tissue are prepared as for the amyloid solubilisation<br>
assay. Metals in the two fractions are analysed by<br>
inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry, following<br>
appropriate pretreatment with nitric acid and/or hydrogen<br>
peroxide where necessary.<br>
Assay 11. Effect of Administration of Test Compounds on Aβ<br>
deposits in Transgenic Animals<br>
Transgenic mouse models are available for a number of<br>
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease<br>
(Games et al., 1995; Hsiao et al., 1996); Parkinson's<br>
disease (Masliah et al., 2000); familial amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Gurney et al., 1994);<br>
Huntington's disease (Reddy et al., 1998); and Creutzfeld-<br>
Jakob disease (CJD) (Telling et al., 1994). We have found<br>
that one of the transgenic models for Alzheimer's disease,<br>
the APP2576 transgenic mouse (Hsiao et al., 1996) also has<br>
a high incidence of cataract. These animal models are<br>
suitable for testing the methods of the invention.<br>
Transgenic mice of the strain APP2576 (Hsiao et al<br>
1996) are used. Eight to nine month old female mice are<br>
selected and divided into groups for treatment.<br>
Mice are sacrificed at intervals, and their brains<br>
examined to determine whether the treatment with test<br>
compounds decreased brain amyloid formation, and the<br>
identification of the most effective administration<br>
protocol. The levels of soluble and insoluble Aβ in the<br>
brain and serum are determined using calibrated Western<br>
blots as per the methodology described for Assay 9. Brain<br>
Amyloid Solubilisation Assay.<br>
Other mice in each group are tested over a period of<br>
up to eight months for cognitive performance, using a<br>
Morris water maze according to standard methods. The<br><br>
general health and well-being of the animals is also<br>
measured every day by a blinded operator, using a five<br>
point integer scale which subjectively rates a combination<br>
of features, including motor activity, alertness and<br>
general health signs.<br>
Assay 12. Physiochemical Properties<br>
Polar Surface Area Calculations (PSA)<br>
Polar surface area values were calculated using the<br>
web-based program available through "Molinspiration", a<br>
package for calculation of molecular properties.<br>
Turbidimetric Solubility Measurements<br>
The solubility estimate was measured at both pH 2.0<br>
and pH 6.5. This is within the pH range that can be<br>
anticipated along the proximal gastrointestinal tract in<br>
humans.<br>
The compounds were dissolved in DMSO to appropriate<br>
concentrations and then spiked into either 0.01M HC1<br>
(approx. pH = 2.0) or pH 6.5 isotonic phosphate buffer,<br>
the final DMSO concentration being 1%. Samples were then<br>
analysed via Nephelometry to determine a solubility range.<br>
[as per D. Bevan and R. S. Lloyd, Anal. Chem. 2000, 72,<br>
1781-1787].<br>
cLog P values<br>
Theoretical Log P values were determined using the<br>
ACD Log P software. The values quoted have been<br>
calculated from an untrained database and refer to the<br>
unionised species.<br>
Assay 13. Blood Brain Barrier Penetration<br>
The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added to obtain<br>
solutions at a concentration of 50 µM in PBS containing<br>
1.25-2.5% DMSO. A trace amount of 14C-sucrose was added to<br>
each stock infusion solution (approx 0.01 µCi/mL) to act<br>
as Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)-impermeable marker in order<br><br>
to assess the integrity of the BBB during each perfusion<br>
and to estimate the volume of the residual vascular space<br>
(RVS) in samples of brain tissue (ie: the volume of fluid<br>
remaining inside the lumen of blood vessels at the end of<br>
each perfusion).<br>
Adult male Spague Dawley rats (180-190g) were<br>
anaesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of Urethane<br>
(25% w/v) at a dose of 1.0 mL/100g body weight. The right<br>
common carotid artery was surgically exposed and<br>
cannulated for perfusion of the cerebral circulation. The<br>
right external carotid artery (which supplies tissues<br>
outside the skull) was then ligated distal to its<br>
bifurcation from the right common carotid artery so that<br>
all of the infusion solution would pass into the brain via<br>
the remaining right internal carotid artery. The heart<br>
was then exposed and transected immediately prior to the<br>
commencement of the infusion. The rate of the infusion<br>
was controlled by a pump set to deliver at 3.2mL/min<br>
(approx. 85% of the normal blood supply to the brain for<br>
this size of rat). The infusion cannula initially<br>
contained a 0.5 mL pre-wash of heparinised PBS (10 IU/ml)<br>
that acts to flush blood vessels and to prevent blood from<br>
clotting and blocking small vessels.<br>
After 1.5 minutes, the infusion pump automatically<br>
stopped, the cannula was withdrawn from the carotid artery<br>
and a sample of the infusion solution (1-1.5 mL) was then<br>
collected from the tip of the infusion cannula. The brain<br>
was then dissected free and divided into 3 parts; the<br>
right hemisphere together with the right midbrain, the<br>
left hemisphere together with the left midbrain and the<br>
hindbrain (cerebellum, pons and brainstem). Only the<br>
right part of the brain was used for subsequent<br>
measurements because perfusion via the right internal<br>
carotid artery preferentially supplies the right<br>
hemisphere and right midbrain (the left hemisphere and<br>
hindbrain receive a variable collateral perfusion). The<br>
brain tissue samples from each animal were frozen at -<br>
30°C, homogenized and weighed aliquots analysed by LC-MS<br><br>
to give total brain concentration. The analysis was<br>
carried out using the Micromass Triple Quad instrument.<br>
The mobile phase consisted of an acetonitrile / water<br>
gradient (containing 0.05% Formic acid) and the column was<br>
a Phenomenex Luna CN.<br>
Small aliquots from each brain tissue sample and the<br>
corresponding infusion solution were analysed by liquid<br>
scintillation counting to determine the level of 14C-<br>
sucrose. The residual vascular space (RVS) in each brain<br>
tissue sample was calculated by dividing the measured<br>
concentration of sucrose in brain tissue (dpm/mg) by its<br>
concentration in the corresponding infusion solution<br>
(dpm/µL) . This is the volume of fluid that remains inside<br>
blood vessels at the end of each perfusion. Multiplying<br>
this RVS by the concentration of the test compound in the<br>
infusion solution gives the total residual amount of the<br>
test compound that is present inside blood vessels in each<br>
brain tissue sample (ie: that which has not crossed the<br>
BBB). Subtracting this from the total brain concentration<br>
gives the amount of drug in each brain tissue sample that<br>
is outside the blood vessels (ie: which has crossed the<br>
BBB). Dividing this RVS-corrected brain concentration<br>
gives the brain uptake ratio (Equation. 1).<br><br>
A total of 5-6 brain perfusion experiments were<br>
performed for each of the test compounds and mean brain<br>
uptake ratios were calculated.<br>
Ratios of greater than 50% indicate compounds that<br>
enter the brain extremely rapidly; ratios between 10 and<br>
50% indicate compounds that enter the brain well; ratios<br>
less than 10% (not observed) would indicate compounds that<br>
enter the brain very slowly and would not be suitable for<br><br>
therapeutic administration; ratios less than 1% (not<br>
observed) would indicate compounds that are effectively<br>
excluded from the brain.<br>
Assay 14. Transgenic Mouse Brain Immunohistochemistry<br>
The APP2576 transgenic mouse (Hsiao et al., 1996) as<br>
referred to in Assay 11 is utilized in this assay. The<br>
contralateral formalin-fixed mouse brain tissue is<br>
coronally cut. Sections (10 urn) are taken from the<br>
corresponding sites and treated with 80% formic acid for<br>
antigen retrieval. The primary antibody used is<br>
monoclonal antibody 1E8, which recognizes epitopes between<br>
residues 18 and 22 of Aβ (SmithKline Beecham, UK) .<br>
Immunoreactivity is developed with secondary antibody<br>
linked to horseradish peroxidase (using a 3,39-<br>
diaminobenzidinechromagen) (Dako) and alkaline phosphatase<br>
(using 5-bromo-4-chloro 3-indoxyl phosphate and nitroblue<br>
tetrazolium chloride chromagen) (Dako). Plaque abundance<br>
per section is assessed by two operators blinded to<br>
treatment according to the following scale:<br>
0	= no plaques apparent<br>
1	= plaques present but very sparse<br>
2	= several plaques present<br>
3	= numerous plaques visible in restricted areas<br>
4	= plaques abundant and not restricted to any<br>
particular area.<br>
Intermediate values eg 2.5 are assigned where applicable.<br>
Students' t ' test is used for comparisons between groups.<br>

Assay 17. Synthetic amyloid plaque disaggregation assay<br>
This assay measures the ability of test compounds to<br>
dissolve aggregates of synthetic Alzheimer's A-beta 42<br>
residue peptide formed by precipitation with zinc.<br>
The synthetic plaque disaggregation assay is a<br>
thioflavin T fluorescence-based assay which measures the<br>
ability of a test compound to disaggregate synthetic<br>
aggregates generated by the incubation of Alzheimer's<br>
amyloid A-beta protein (A3) in the presence of zinc.<br>
The 42 residue A-beta which is the form most<br>
prevalent in Alzheimer's amyloid plaques is precipitated<br>
by the addition of zinc salts to form a beta sheet<br>
conformational aggregate physicochemically congruent with<br>
the crystalline amyloid plaque cores. Thioflavin T, an<br>
agent which exhibits specific fluorescence when it<br>
intercalates within a beta sheet structure, is<br>
incorporated into the A-beta/Zn aggregate during the<br>
aggregation process. Solubilisation of the metal bound<br>
aggregates by a test compound will result in reduced<br>
fluorescence as the beta sheet conformation is lost. The<br>
activity of a compound in this assay is a combination of<br>
its metal chelating properties, solubility, hydrophobicity<br>
and structural elements which influence interaction with<br>
the amyloid mass.<br>
The assay models the process by which a test compound<br>
is acting, either to compete for bound metals with Aβ or<br>
alternatively to displace metals by competitively binding<br>
at the metal binding site, resulting in Aβ precipitated by<br>
zinc, being solubilised, as an in vitro model of plaque<br>
disaggregation.<br>
Assay reagents<br>
Aliquots of synthetic Aβ peptide are prepared for<br>
convenience. Aβ is dissolved in distilled H2O and peptide<br>
concentration is assessed by absorption at 214nm against a<br>
validated standard curve. Abeta/Zn aggregates in the<br><br>
presence of solvent only (DMSO) and control vehicle (PBS)<br>
are included in each assay as negative controls.<br>
The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to a<br>
concentration of 5mM. Dilutions were made in DMSO as<br>
appropriate to 100 times the desired final concentration<br>
and added immediately to the A-beta aggregates.<br>
Method<br>
A-beta 1-42 is incubated with ZnC12 and Thioflavine T<br>
(ThT) in a molar ratio of (1:2:2) for 24 hours at 37<br>
degrees on a rotating wheel in PBS pH 6.6. Following<br>
incubation, aggregates are incubated with test drug for a<br>
further 2 hours at 37 degrees with rotation. PBS blank,<br>
untreated aggregates and DMSO controls are included with<br>
each experiment. After 2 hour incubation, samples are<br>
measured for ThT fluorescence using an LS55 (Perkin Elmer)<br>
fluorimeter in a cuvette.<br>
Data are generated in FL Winlab software (Perkin<br>
Elmer) and analysed using GraphPad Prism v4.0 software.<br>
Data are calculated as the average of multiple reads.<br>
Results<br>
Results are presented in tabular form as the<br>
concentration (uM) at which 50% disaggregation (IC50) is<br>
obtained and as percent disaggregation at 5uM (expressed<br>
as 5/% reduction). The two values together provide a<br>
measure of the efficiency of disaggregation.<br>
If the compound does not achieve 50% disaggregation<br>
within the concentration range tested the result is<br>
recorded as &gt;20µM, corresponding to the maximum<br>
concentration at which the compound is tested.. This<br>
result indicates that the test compound is relatively poor<br>
at being able to disaggregate the Aβ 1-42 aggregates. A<br>
test compound able to achieve an IC50 at less than 20uM and<br>
scoring greater than 20% disaggregation at 5µM is<br>
considered 'good'. A test compound able to achieve an IC50<br>
at less than 20µM and scoring greater than 40%<br>
disaggregation at 5µM is considered 'very good'.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
