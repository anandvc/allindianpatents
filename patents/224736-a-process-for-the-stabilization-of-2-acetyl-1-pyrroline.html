				<td>The present invention relates to 'A process for stabilization of 2-acetyl-l-pyrroline'. The compound is principle aroma component of basmati and other varieties of scented rice and also of processed cereal and grain products'.<br>
The main uses of the present invention are (i) making the basmati rice flavouring in easily dispersible powder form and (ii) imparting stability to an otherwise labile aroma chemical. These products are of value in the art of application of flavor to foodstuffs like rice and bakery products and relate preparations. Background and prior art references<br>
Scented rice is one of the varieties of rice1-6 having a characteristic, strong aroma when cooked. Varieties of Basmati in Southeastern Asia, Delia in America, Milagrosa in Philippines, 'Khao Dawk Mali 105' in Thailand, 'Seratus Malam' in Indonesia and Heiri in Japan are the major scented rice varieties. In certain parts of the world where these varieties are cultivated, scented rice is highly desired and sometimes used for special purposes.<br>
2-acetyl -1-pyrroline was first identified in rice by Buttery et al 7-8 . in 1982. Its odor is described as that of cooked rice and popcorn-like. A method of its synthesis is described starting from 2-acetylpyrrole9. A method for its quantitative analysis has been developed by Buttery ET al10 and later refined by Tanchotikul et al11. This compound is found in all scented rice varieties in various quantities, which is more than that found in non-scented varieties of rice (table 1).<br>

Structural Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2-acetyl - 1-pyrroline can be characterized by a comparison of its retention time and MS data with those of a reference standard or reported in literature. The mass spectrum of 2-acetyl - 1-pyrroline has major peaks at m/z 111(M+1 5 % abundance, 83 (11), 69 (11), 68 (8), 67 (0.2), 55(2), 52 (0.9), 54 (0.2) and 43 (100), 42 (24) and 41 (50). It's Kovats index is 1320 on a Pyrex glass capillary column coated with Carbowax 20M. It's IR spectrum in CCU displays absorption maxima at 1695, 1620, 1435, 1370, 1340, 1250, 1080,1000, 975 and 940 cm'1.<br>
The compound is a colorless liquid when freshly prepared and purified. It needs to be immediately protected from light and air and preserved in sealed vials under vacuum at temperatures below -20°C. Even at under these conditions it is reported to turn to red on storage and eventually become darker on longer storage. A conjugated polymer, resulting from conjugation of the carbonyl groups with the 5-position of other molecules resulting in a polymeric product, is believed to be the cause of its instability. For this reason the compound is more stable and better preserved in dilute, especially aqueous, solutions wherein it is stable for several months at low temperatures (
It seems reasonable that 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline has a similar origin to the bread aroma compound 2-acetyl-l,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine12. It is assumed that the intermediate formed after decarboxylation of proline residue, is hydrolyzed with the formation of 1-pyrroline. 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline results from the acetylation 1-pyrroline by 2-o\opropanal. Many syntheses of 2-a
Reference may be made to the United States Patents (Duby; Philippe (Prilly, CH); Huynh-Ba; Tuong (Fully, CH) 5,280,127, 1994; Duby; Philippe ; Huynh-Ba; Tuong , 5,401,521&amp; 5,446,171,1995 and Duby; Philippe ; Huynh-Ba; Tuong , 5.512,290, 1996 ), wherein a powder-form composition of 2-acetyl-l-pyrroline incorporated with a support of maltodextrin and/or cyclodextrin. The composition is prepared by hydrolyzing a 2-(l-alkoxyethenyl)-l-pyrroline with an acid to obtain a reaction medium, adding an equi-molar amount of a base to the reaction medium to obtain a neutralized reaction medium containing 2-acetyl-l-pyrroline, combining maltodextrin and/or cyclodextrin with the neutral reaction medium to obtain a support solution and freeze-drying the support solution to obtain the composition. The main drawback of these methods is that the flavor needs to be released from the precursor by the neutralization with a base and the resultant salt would remain in the product.<br>
Reference may be made to another United States Patent (Buttery; Ronald G.; Ling; Louisa C.; Juliano; Bienvenido O., 4,522,838, 1985), wherein the compound, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline and its use in flavoring foods, particularly in imparting a scented rice flavor to foods is disclosed. The drawback of this invention is that the flavorant is used in its salt form and therefore needs to be released prior to use.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for stabilization of 2-acetyl-l-pyrroline, a principle basmati aroma component', which obviates the aforesaid drawbacks of the processes described in the prior art.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides, 'an improved process for stabilization of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the basmati rice flavourant'. Which comprises synthesis of 2-acetyl-l-pyrroline by a known method, incorporation of the flavor in a binding material like a gum or starch from a vegetable source in water emulsion using an emulsifier followed by drying the mixture by either vacuum shelf drying at temperatures of 30-60°C and reduced pressure of 24" or spray drying at inlet air temp. 140ºC, outlet temp. 80ºC and a feed rate of 80 ml / min and obtaining the flavor in an easily dispersible dry powder form for flavoring rice and related products.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Also in another experiment starch (200 g) was dissolved in 2 1 water, Tween (4 drops) and a solution of 110 mg of 2-acetyl-l-pyrroline (&gt; 95 % purity, synthetic sample) in ethanol (3 ml) added and the mixture homogenized for 5 min. and spray-dried under the following conditions. Inlet-air temp. 140° C, outlet temp. 80° C and a feed rate of 80 ml / min. The yield was 162.2 g.<br>
Incorporation of    synthetic basmati flavor in to rice and its comparison with Natural basmati rice<br>
Preparation of Sweetened basmati rice<br>
A)	Rice (added basmati flavor)<br>
Rice (100 g) was taken, added water (1:3) and cooked for 15 mins. Cooked rice was macerated in a mixer for 1 min. Condensed milk diluted with water (1:1, 150 ml) and encapsulated basmati flavor (1% w Av basis on raw rice) were added into the cooked rice and chilled.<br>
B)	Natural basmati rice<br>
Rice (100 g) was taken, added water (1:3) and cooked for 15 mins. Cooked rice was macerated in a mixer for 1 min. T~      ' ited condensed milk (150 ml) was added to the cooked rice and chilled. Evaluation of sweetened basmati rice<br>
Rice with added basmati flavor and natural basmati rice were evaluated by sensory analysis on a 10-point scale for quality attributes such as aroma, texture and overall acceptability by a panel of 10 judges. The results revealed that the rice with added flavor was preferred and liked more in comparison to the natural basmati rice with respect to the aroma and overall quality. However the texture was described as "pasty" in both the samples.<br>
