				<td>CONDENSATE EXTRACTOR FOR CHARGE AIR COOLER SYSTEMS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more specifically to internal combustion engine assemblies equipped with a<br>
supercharging device and a charge air cooler system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Internal combustion engines (ICE) are often called upon to generate<br>
considerable levels of power for prolonged periods of time on a dependable basis. Many<br>
such ICE assemblies employ a mechanical supercharging device, such as a turbocharger (or<br>
turbine driven, forced induction supercharger), to compress the airflow before it enters the<br>
intake manifold of the engine in order to increase power and efficiency. Specifically, a<br>
turbocharger is a gas compressor that forces more air and, thus, more oxygen into the<br>
combustion chambers of the ICE than is otherwise achievable with ambient atmospheric<br>
pressure. The additional mass of oxygen-containing air that is forced into the ICE<br>
improves the engine's volumetric efficiency, allowing it to burn more fuel in a given cycle,<br>
and thereby produce more power.<br>
[0003]	Under extreme operating conditions, the "supercharging" process may<br>
elevate the temperatures of the intake air to an extent that causes the formation of<br>
undesired exhaust by-products, such as various nitrogen oxides (NOx), and reduces the<br>
density of the air charge. To combat this problem, ICE manufacturers have historically<br>
employed a device most commonly known as an intercooler, but more appropriately<br>
identified as a charge-air-cooler (CAC) or aftercooler, to extract heat from the air exiting<br>
the supercharging device. A CAC is a heat exchange device used to cool the air charge<br>
and, thus, further improve volumetric efficiency of the ICE by increasing intake air<br>
charge density through isochoric cooling. A decrease in air intake temperature provides a<br>
denser intake charge to the engine and allows more air and fuel to be combusted per<br>
engine cycle, increasing the output of the engine.<br>
[0004]	The heat exchange process can cause moisture (water) to condense and,<br>
thus, form inside of the CAC system, especially when conducted in conditions where the<br>
 <br>
ambient air flowing through the supercharging device and CAC is substantially humid<br>
(e.g., greater than 50% relative humidity). The condensation tends to accumulate<br>
downstream from the CAC, within the conduit through which the intake manifold receives<br>
the supercharged airflow. The liquefied condensation can be drawn into the intake<br>
manifold, entering the various cylinder combustion chambers. Depending upon the<br>
configuration of the CAC and supercharging devices, as well as their individual and<br>
relative packaging, the condensation may begin to puddle and enter the combustion<br>
chambers in large amounts, potentially causing the ICE to misfire, leading to premature<br>
engine wear, and creating a false-positive error signal triggering a service engine indicator<br>
light. In addition, accumulated water condensate that is not properly evacuated from the<br>
CAC can freeze and crack the CAC when ambient temperatures reach below freezing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	According to one embodiment of the present invention, an internal<br>
combustion engine assembly is provided. The internal combustion assembly has an air<br>
intake system including an intake manifold in downstream fluid communication with a<br>
throttle body. A charge air cooler system is in upstream fluid communication with the<br>
intake manifold and the throttle body. A hose member has a first end in direct fluid<br>
communication with the charge air cooler system, and a second end in direct fluid<br>
communication with the intake manifold. The hose member is configured to remove<br>
condensate from the charge air cooler system, preventing premature engine wear as well as<br>
prolonging the operational life expectancy of the charge air cooler system.<br>
[0006]	The hose member defines at least one orifice configured to restrict the<br>
flow of air and condensate through the hose member. This restriction prevents<br>
undesirable amounts of condensate and air from bypassing the throttle body and entering<br>
the intake manifold, thus maintaining good engine speed control. In addition, a filter may<br>
be placed in direct fluid communication with the hose member, in upstream fluid<br>
communication with the orifice. The filter helps prevent plugging of the orifice by<br>
minimizing or eliminating contaminate buildup.<br>
[0007]	The charge air cooler system is operatively attached to the internal<br>
combustion engine. Once the charge air cooler system is properly attached, the first end<br>
 <br>
of the hose member is placed in direct fluid communication with the vertically lowest<br>
most portion of the charge air cooler system. In doing so, pooling or puddling of water<br>
condensation within the charge air cooler system is minimized or eliminated. In a similar<br>
regard, the hose member is oriented such that the first end is the vertically lowest most<br>
portion thereof. In this instance, pooling or puddling of water condensation within the<br>
condensate extractor system is minimized or eliminated. In addition, the charge air<br>
cooler system includes a first end tank in upstream fluid communication with a second<br>
end tank. To this regard, the first end of the hose member is in direct fluid<br>
communication with the second end tank.<br>
[0008]	The throttle body creates a pressure gradient when the internal combustion<br>
engine is in an on-state. The hose member removes condensate from the charge air<br>
cooler system in a continuous manner in response to the pressure gradient, spreading out<br>
water ingestion by the intake manifold, thereby preventing engine misfire. Ideally, the<br>
hose member is configured to maintain, for example, but not limited to, 2.5 ounces or less<br>
of condensate in the charge air cooler system. When in operation, the hose member<br>
introduces a first volume of air to the air intake system, whereas the charge air cooler<br>
system introduces a second volume of air to the air intake system. Notably, the first<br>
volume of air is substantially smaller than the second volume such that engine mass-air-<br>
flow control is not affected.<br>
[0009]	The hose member is characterized by a lack of fluid communication with a<br>
reservoir or tank configured to collect condensate. As such, slosh and road camber<br>
phenomena associated with the use of reservoirs is eliminated. In a similar regard, the hose<br>
member is characterized by a lack of a direct fluid communication with the throttle body.<br>
[0010]	According to another embodiment of the present invention, an internal<br>
combustion engine assembly having an engine block is provided. The internal<br>
combustion engine assembly includes an exhaust manifold in fluid communication with<br>
the engine block to receive and expel exhaust gases therefrom. The internal combustion<br>
engine assembly also includes an air intake system with an intake manifold in<br>
downstream fluid communication with a throttle body. The throttle body creates a<br>
pressure gradient when the internal combustion engine is in an on-state.<br>
 <br>
[0011]	The present embodiment also includes a turbocharger device, including a<br>
compressor blade rotatably disposed in a compressor housing, and configured for<br>
compressing airflow. The compressor housing is in upstream fluid communication with<br>
the charge air cooler system for providing compressed air thereto. The turbocharger<br>
device also includes a turbine blade rotatably disposed in a turbine housing. The turbine<br>
blade is rigidly attached to the compressor blade for unitary rotation therewith. The<br>
turbine housing is in downstream fluid communication with the exhaust manifold to<br>
receive and redirect exhaust flow therefrom to spin the turbine blade.<br>
[0012]	Also included in the internal combustion engine assembly is a charge air<br>
cooler system in downstream fluid communication with the turbocharger device, and in<br>
upstream fluid communication with the air intake system. The charge air cooler system<br>
is configured to extract heat from compressed airflow exiting the turbocharger device.<br>
[0013]	A hose member has a first end in direct fluid communication with the<br>
charge air cooler system, and a second end in direct fluid communication with the intake<br>
manifold. The hose member removes condensate from the charge air cooler system in a<br>
continuous manner in response to the pressure gradient created by the intake manifold.<br>
The hose member also defines at least one orifice that is configured to restrict the flow of<br>
air and condensate through the hose member. A filter is in direct fluid communication<br>
with the hose member, and in upstream fluid communication with the orifice.<br>
[0014]	The above features and advantages, and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention, will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of<br>
the preferred embodiments and best modes for carrying out the present invention when<br>
taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and appended claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0015]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of an internal combustion engine<br>
assembly equipped with a charge air cooler system having a condensate extractor system<br>
in accordance with the present invention in fluid communication therewith; and<br>
[0016]	FIGURE 1A is an enlarged schematic view of a portion of the charge air<br>
cooler system and condensate extractor system of FIG. 1.<br>
 <br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components throughout the several views, FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a<br>
representative internal combustion engine assembly, identified generally as 10, with<br>
which the present invention may be utilized. It should be readily understood that FIG. 1<br>
is merely an exemplary application by which the present invention may be practiced. As<br>
such, the present invention is by no means limited to the particular engine configuration<br>
of FIG. 1. In addition, the drawings presented herein, i.e., FIGS. 1 and 1A, are not to<br>
scale and are provided purely for instructional purposes. Thus, the specific and relative<br>
dimensions shown in the drawings are not to be considered limiting.<br>
[0018]	The internal combustion engine (ICE) assembly 10 for a motorized<br>
vehicle, such as, but not limited to, standard passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, light<br>
trucks, heavy duty vehicles, minivans, buses, tractors, etc., includes an engine block and<br>
cylinder head, indicated collectively at 12, equipped with a supercharging device,<br>
represented herein by a turbocharger device 14, and a charge air cooler (CAC) system 16.<br>
Notably, the engine block and cylinder head 12, turbocharger device 14, and CAC system<br>
16 shown in FIG. 1 hereof have been greatly simplified, it being understood that further<br>
information regarding such systems may be found in the prior art. In addition, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the engine block (or cylinder case) and cylinder head<br>
12 may be integrally formed (as depicted in FIG. 1), or be pre-fabricated as individual<br>
components that are subsequently connected, e.g., by bolting or other fastening method.<br>
Finally, the ICE assembly 10 may operate in a compression ignited or spark ignited<br>
combustion mode within the scope of the invention claimed herein.<br>
[0019]	With continued reference to FIG. 1, the ICE assembly 10 includes an<br>
exhaust manifold 30 (or header) configured to receive and expel exhaust gases therefrom.<br>
For example, the cylinder block portion of the engine block and cylinder head 12 defines<br>
a plurality of exhaust ports (not shown) through which exhaust gases or products of<br>
combustion are selectively evacuated from a plurality of variable volume combustion<br>
chambers (not shown). The exhaust ports communicate the exhaust gases to the exhaust<br>
manifold 30, which is defined within the cylinder head portion of the engine block and<br>
cylinder head 12. The ICE assembly 10 also includes an air intake system, which is<br>
 <br>
represented herein by an intake manifold 40 (or inlet manifold) in downstream fluid<br>
communication with a throttle body 42. The throttle body 42 is operable to control the<br>
amount of air flowing into the engine, normally in response to driver input. The intake<br>
manifold 40, on the other hand, is responsible for supplying the fuel/air mixture to the<br>
variable volume combustion chambers. The throttle body 42 creates a pressure gradient<br>
when the ICE assembly 10 is in an on-state.<br>
[0020]	The turbocharger device 14 is in fluid communication with the ICE<br>
assembly 10. More specifically, the turbocharger device 14 includes a turbine portion 18<br>
and a compressor portion 20. The turbine portion 18 has a turbine housing 22, which is<br>
in fluid communication with the exhaust manifold 30 via exhaust line 23. The turbine<br>
housing 22 redirects the flowing exhaust stream to spin a turbine blade or impeller,<br>
shown hidden in FIG. 1 at 28, rotatably mounted therein. The compressor portion 20 has<br>
a compressor housing 24 with a compressor blade, shown hidden in FIG. 1 at 26,<br>
rotatably mounted therein. Inlet air is received by the compressor housing 24 from a<br>
clean air filter 32 via clean air duct 25. The turbine blade 28 is rigidly mounted to the<br>
compressor blade 26 for unitary rotation therewith. As the compressor blade 26 spins, air<br>
received from air filter 32 is compressed within the compressor housing 24. Air<br>
compressed by the compressor portion 20 is communicated by compressor output duct<br>
(or CAC inlet duct) 27 to the CAC system 16, the compressor housing 24 being in<br>
upstream fluid communication with the CAC system 16. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that the present invention may incorporate a single turbocharger, twin<br>
turbochargers, staged turbochargers, or various other engine supercharging devices<br>
without departing from the intended scope of the present invention.<br>
[0021]	Still referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, a mass airflow (MAF) sensor 34<br>
is positioned between the clean air filter 32 and clean air duct 25. The MAF sensor 34 is<br>
used to determine the mass of air entering the ICE assembly 10 - i.e., through the<br>
compressor portion 20 of turbocharger device 14, and communicate this information to<br>
an engine control unit (ECU) 36. The air mass information is necessary for the ECU 36<br>
to calculate and deliver the correct fuel mass to the intake manifold 40.<br>
[0022]	The charge air output is routed from the compressor portion 20 of the<br>
turbocharger device 14 through the CAC (or aftercooler) system 16 before entering the<br>
 <br>
intake manifold 40. To this regard, the CAC system 16 is positioned in downstream fluid<br>
communication with the turbocharger device 14, and in upstream fluid communication<br>
with the air intake system (i.e., air intake manifold 40 and throttle body 42). The CAC<br>
system 16 is configured to extract heat from compressed airflow (i.e., cool the air charge)<br>
exiting the turbocharger device 14. Although condensate buildup is a phenomena<br>
normally associated with air-to-air charge air cooler devices, the CAC system 16 may<br>
also be of the air-to-liquid type heat exchanger.<br>
[0023]	The CAC system 16 includes a heat exchange core assembly 50 with a<br>
first end tank 52 (also referred to herein as the "hot-end tank" or "upstream-end tank")<br>
operatively attached thereto. The upstream end tank 52 provides a transition to allow the<br>
intake air from the turbocharger device 14 to flow from the compressor output duct 27<br>
into the inner cooling tubes (not shown) of the CAC system 16. The upstream end tank<br>
52 is in upstream fluid communication with a second end tank 54 (also referred to herein<br>
as the "cold-end tank" or "downstream-end tank") operatively attached to an opposite end<br>
of the heat exchange core assembly 50. The downstream end tank 54 provides a<br>
transition to allow the intake air to flow from the tubes of the CAC system 16 to an<br>
induction duct 29, for transfer to the throttle body 42.<br>
[0024]	As seen in FIG. 1, the ICE assembly 10 employs a condensate extractor<br>
system 70 to remove water condensation from the CAC system 16, thereby preventing<br>
premature engine wear as well as prolonging the operational life expectancy of the CAC<br>
system 16. The condensate extractor system 70 includes a hose member 72 having first<br>
and second ends 74 and 76, respectively. The first end 74 of hose member 72 is in direct<br>
fluid communication with the CAC system 16. whereas the second end 76 is in direct<br>
fluid communication with the intake manifold 40. By attaching the hose member 72 in<br>
this manner, air mass is not added to or subtracted from the intake manifold 40 that has<br>
not been measured by the MAF sensor 34, which is important for the ECU 36 to calculate<br>
the correct amount of fuel to inject. This is necessary in order to regulate emissions and<br>
have the ICE assembly 10 run smoothly.<br>
[0025]	The hose member 72 defines at least one orifice 78 configured to restrict<br>
the flow of air and condensate through the hose member 72. Inclusion of the orifice 78<br>
helps prevent undesirable amounts of water condensation and air from bypassing the<br>
 <br>
throttle body 42 through the hose member 72, and entering the intake manifold 40, thus<br>
maintaining good engine speed control. For example, when the ICE assembly 10 is in<br>
operation, the hose member 72 introduces a first volume of air to the air intake system,<br>
whereas the CAC system introduces a second volume of air to the air intake system. The<br>
first volume of air introduced by the condensate extractor system 70 is substantially<br>
smaller than the second volume (i.e., negligible in comparison) such that control of the<br>
engine mass-air-flow is left unaffected. In addition, a filter 80 may placed in direct fluid<br>
communication with the hose member 72, in upstream fluid communication with the<br>
orifice 78. The filter 80 helps prevent plugging of the hose member 72 and orifice 78 by<br>
minimizing or eliminating contaminate buildup.<br>
[0026]	As noted above, the throttle body 42 creates a pressure gradient when the<br>
ICE assembly 10 is in an on-state. "Engine misfire" is a phenomena that may occur<br>
when a threshold volume of water condensation builds up inside of the CAC system 16,<br>
which is then ingested in undesirable volumes into the intake manifold 40 due to the<br>
higher "suction" pressure created by the intake manifold 40. The present invention<br>
systematically mitigates the condensate buildup, feeding it in negligible quantities to the<br>
intake manifold 40, so that it never reaches the threshold point. More specifically, the<br>
hose member 72 removes condensate from the CAC system 16 in a continuous and<br>
controlled manner in response to the pressure gradient, spreading out water ingestion by<br>
the intake manifold 40, thereby preventing engine misfire. Ideally, the hose member 72 is<br>
configured to maintain, for example, but not limited to, 2.5 ounces (oz) or less of<br>
condensate in the CAC system. For example the length and internal diameter of the hose<br>
member 72, as well as the size of the orifice 78, can be selectively modified to provide<br>
varying levels of condensate extraction - i.e., varying suction rates.<br>
[0027]	Many prior art condensate extractors employ a reservoir or tank<br>
configured to collect water condensation. However, accumulated condensate that is not<br>
properly evacuated from a charge air cooler can freeze when ambient temperatures reach<br>
below freezing, causing the charge air cooler to break down. In addition, reservoirs have a<br>
tendency to buildup excessive water which noticeably "slosh" during vehicle turns and<br>
acceleration. In addition, most reservoirs are functionally dependent upon gravity, and<br>
are thus operatively sensitive to variations in lateral road orientation - known as "road<br>
 <br>
camber effect." The condensate extractor system 70 in accordance with the present<br>
invention, namely hose member 72, is characterized by a lack of fluid communication<br>
with a reservoir or tank configured to collect water condensation. By eliminating use of a<br>
reservoir or tank, slosh and road camber phenomena associated with the use of reservoirs<br>
is eliminated. In a similar regard, the hose member is characterized by a lack of a direct<br>
fluid communication with the throttle body to further militate against unwanted<br>
interruption of engine control by ECU 36.<br>
[0028]	FIG. 1A provides an enlarged schematic view of a portion of the CAC<br>
system 16 and condensate extractor system 70 of FIG. 1. A tubular portion 73 of the<br>
hose member 72 is passed through a braise or channel 82 formed in the downstream-end<br>
(or cold-end) tank 54 of the CAC system 16. According to preferred practice, the first<br>
end 74 of the hose member 72 is placed in direct fluid communication with the vertically<br>
lowest most portion of the CAC system 16. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 1A, the<br>
tubular portion 73 of the hose member 72 is passed through the channel 82 until it abuts<br>
or sits against a locator 84, which is placed immediately adjacent a bottom surface of the<br>
CAC system heat exchange core assembly 50. The vertically lowest actual point of the<br>
CAC system 16, downstream from the heat exchange core 50 (e.g., the cold-end tank 54)<br>
is where water condensation tends to naturally build up through gravity and airflow. By<br>
placing the first end 74 of the hose member 72 in direct fluid communication (e.g., with<br>
cross-drilled hole 75) with the vertically lowest point of the CAC downstream-end tank<br>
54, pooling or puddling of water condensation within the charge air cooler system 16 is<br>
minimized or eliminated. In a similar regard, the hose member 72 is oriented such that<br>
the first end 74 is the vertically lowest most portion thereof. By packaging the hose<br>
member 72 in this manner, pooling or puddling of water condensation within the<br>
condensate extractor system 70 is minimized or eliminated.<br>
[0029]	While the best modes for carrying out the present invention have been<br>
