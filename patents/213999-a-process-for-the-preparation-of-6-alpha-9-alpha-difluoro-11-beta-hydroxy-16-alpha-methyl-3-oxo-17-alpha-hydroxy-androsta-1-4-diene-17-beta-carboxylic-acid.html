				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 6 ALPHA,9 ALPHA-DIFLURO-11BETA-<br>
HYDR0XY-16ALPHA-METHYL-3-OXO-17ALPHA-HYDROXY-ANDR0STA-l,4-DIENE-17 BETA<br>
-CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the synthesis of a known<br>
intermediate, useful in the preparation of anti-inflammatory steroids. There is<br>
also provided a new physical form of the intermediate which has improved<br>
handling properties<br>
6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-16a-methyl-17a-propionyloxy-3-oxoandrosta-1, 4-<br>
diene-17ß-carbothioic acid, S-fluoromethyl ester (Formula A) was first described<br>
as an anti-inflammatory steroid by US Patent No. 4,335,121. This compound is<br>
also known by the generic name of fluticasone propionate and has since<br>
become widely known as a highly effective steroid in the treatment of<br>
inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
disease (COPD).<br>
Additionally, 6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-17a-propionyloxy-<br>
androsta-1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3-yl) ester<br>
(Formula B) was described in WO 97/24365 as a class of hydrolysable steroids<br>
with lactone derivatives. This compound possesses useful anti-inflammatory<br>
activity whilst having little or no systemic activity.<br>
Currently there is considerable interest in compounds of formula (A) and (B) as<br>
anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic compounds in the treatment of asthma and<br>
other inflammatory diseases.<br>
US 4,335,121 and WO 97/24365 describe preparations of fluticasone propionate<br>
and 6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-17a-propionyloxy-androsta-<br>
1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3-yl) ester, respectively<br>
which utilise a common starting material, namely 6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-<br>
16a-methyl-3-oxo-17a-hydroxy-androsta-1,4-diene-17ß-carboxylic acid (Formula<br>
I). However, this hydroxy acid androstane derivative compound is an extremely<br>
costly starting material for preparing quantities of steroids of formulae (A) and<br>
(B).<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the present invention we provide a novel<br>
process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which comprises the<br>
following step:<br>
wherein step (a) comprises oxidation of a solution containing the compound of<br>
formula (II).<br>
Preferably, step (a) will be performed in the presence of a solvent comprising<br>
methanol, water, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or diethylene glygol dimethylether. For<br>
example, so as to enhance yield and throughput, preferred solvents are<br>
methanol, water or tetrahydrofuran, and more preferably are water or<br>
tetrahydrofuran, especially water and tetrahydrofuran as solvent. Dioxan and<br>
diethylene glygol dimethylether are also preferred solvents which may optionally<br>
(and preferably) be employed together with water.<br>
Preferably, the solvent will be present in an amount of between 3 and 10vol<br>
relative to the amount of the starting material (1wt), more preferably between 4<br>
and 6 vol., especially 5 vol.<br>
If desired, the solution containing the compound of formula (II) may be cooled<br>
prior to oxidation eg. to a temperature less than approximately 10°C.<br>
Preferably the oxidising agent is present in an amount of 1-9 molar equivalents<br>
relative to the amount of the starting material. For example, when a 50% w/w<br>
aqueous solution of periodic acid is employed, the oxidising agent may be<br>
present in an amount of between 1.1 and 10wt. relative to the amount of the<br>
starting material (1wt.), more preferably between 1.1 and 3wt, especially 1.3wt.<br>
Preferably, the oxidation step will comprise the use of a chemical oxidising<br>
agent. More preferably, the oxidising agent will be periodic acid or iodic acid or a<br>
salt thereof. Most preferably, the oxidising agent will be periodic acid or sodium<br>
periodate, especially periodic acid. Alternatively (or in addition), it will also be<br>
appreciated that the oxidation step may comprise any suitable oxidation<br>
reaction, eg. one which utilises air and/or oxygen. When the oxidation reaction<br>
utilises air and/or oxygen, the solvent used in said reaction will preferably be<br>
methanol.<br>
Preferably, step (a) will involve incubating the reagents at room temperature or a<br>
little warmer, say around 25 °C eg for 2 hours.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may be isolated by crystallisation from the reaction<br>
mixture by addition of an anti-solvent. A suitable anti-solvent for compound of<br>
formula (I) is water. Surprisingly we have discovered that it is highly desirable to<br>
control the conditions under which the compound of formula (I) is precipitated by<br>
addition of anti-solvent eg water. When the crystallisation is performed using<br>
chilled water (eg water/ice mixture at a temperature of 0-5 °C) although better<br>
anti-solvent properties may be expected we have found that the crystalline<br>
product produced is very voluminous, resembles a soft gel and is very difficult to<br>
filter. Without being limited by theory we believe that this low density product<br>
contains a large amount of solvated solvent within the crystal lattice By contrast<br>
when conditions of around 10 °C or higher are used (eg around ambient<br>
temperature) a granular product of a sand like consistency which is very easily<br>
filtered is produced. Under these conditions, crystallisation typically commences<br>
after around 1 hour and is typically completed within a few hours (eg 2 hours).<br>
Without being limited by theory we believe that this granular product contains<br>
little or no of solvated solvent within the crystal lattice.<br>
As a further aspect of the invention we provide a process for preparing a<br>
compound of formula (I) which comprises the steps of<br>
(a) oxidation of a solution containing the compound of formula (II) followed by<br>
(b) precipitation of the compound of formula (I) in crystalline form from the<br>
reaction mixture by addition of an anti-solvent under temperature conditions<br>
of around 10 °C or higher.<br>
Preferably the anti-solvent is water. Preferably the temperature of step (b) is<br>
ambient temperature (eg around 18-22 °C) or higher (eg up to 40 °C).<br>
We also provide as an aspect of the invention the compound of formula (I) in the<br>
form of a granular solid which is readily filterable obtainable by a process<br>
comprising:<br>
(a) oxidising of a solution of a compound of formula (II) in water/tetrahydrofuran<br>
wth periodic acid in water at a temperature of around 20-30 °C; followed by<br>
(b) precipitating the compound of formula (I) by addition of water at a<br>
temperature of around 22°C.<br>
As a further aspect of the present invention we provide a novel process for the<br>
preparation of a compound of formula (A) which comprises the following step:<br><br>
wherein step (a) comprises oxidation of a solution containing the compound of<br>
formula (II).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is wherein the process for the<br>
preparation of a compound of formula (A) comprises the following steps:<br>
wherein step (a) comprises oxidation of a solution containing the compound of<br>
formula (II).<br>
Step (b) will typically comprise the addition of a reagent suitable for converting a<br>
carboxylic acid to a carbothioic acid eg. using hydrogen sulphide gas together<br>
with a suitable coupling agent eg. carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in the presence of a<br>
suitable solvent eg. dimethylformamide.<br>
Step (c) typically comprises the addition of a reagent suitable for performing the<br>
esterification to the ethyl ester eg. propionyl chloride in the presence of suitable<br>
solvents eg. diethylamine, triethylamine, dichloromethane and acetone. Step (d)<br>
typically comprises the addition of a reagent suitable for performing alkylation<br>
eg. either by direct conversion by addition of a haloalkyl compound or via an<br>
iodinated intermediate compound.<br>
As a further aspect of the present invention we also provide a novel process for<br>
the preparation of a compound of formula (B) which comprises the following<br>
step:<br><br>
wherein step (a) comprises oxidation of a solution containing the compound of<br>
formula (II).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is wherein the process for the<br>
preparation of a compound of formula (B) comprises the following steps:<br><br>
wherein step (a) comprises oxidation of a solution containing the compound of<br>
formula (II).<br>
Typical conditions for step (b) and (c) are as previously described. Typically,<br>
step (e) will comprise reagents suitable to effect the coupling of compounds of<br>
formula (IV) with compounds of formula (V) eg. in the presence of a suitable<br>
solvent eg. dimethylformamide together with a suitable base eg. 2,4,6-collidine,<br>
pyridine or caesium carbonate. Compounds of formula (B) may then be<br>
optionally purified by suitable recrystallisation processes eg. recrystallisation<br>
from suitable solvents eg. isopropanol, diethylketone or methyl isobutyl ketone.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) may be prepared according to the following process:<br><br>
wherein step (i) typically comprises the addition of a suitable reagent eg.<br>
methanesulphonyl chloride in the presence of solvents eg. triethylamine,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine and ethyl acetate.<br>
In step (e), analogues of compounds of formula (V) in which the MsO-group is<br>
replaced with another leaving group may also be employed.<br>
It will be understood that this novel process makes use of an alternative starting<br>
material, flumethasone (formula (II)). Surprisingly, it has been shown that the<br>
use of such a starting material in the process for preparing fluticasone<br>
propionate and 6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-17a-<br>
propionyloxy-androsta-1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-<br>
3-yl) ester would substantially reduce production costs for these steroids.<br>
As a further aspect of the present invention we also provide the use of a<br>
compound of formula (II):<br><br>
in the preparation of a compound of formula (I):<br><br>
As a further aspect of the present invention we also provide the use of a<br>
compound of formula (II):<br><br>
in the preparation of a compound of formula (A):<br><br>
As a further aspect of the present invention we also provide the use of a<br>
compound of formula (II):<br><br>
in the preparation of a compound of formula (B):<br><br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples:<br>
Intermediate 1: 6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß, 17a-dihvdroxv-16a-methvl-3-oxoandrosta-<br>
1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid<br>
A solution of Example 1 (12.0g) in dry dimethylformamide (250ml) was stirred<br>
and treated with N,N"-carbonyldiimidazole (9.94g) under nitrogen at room<br>
temperature. After 4 hours, hydrogen sulphide was passed through the solution<br>
for 0.5 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into 2M hydrochloric acid (500ml)<br>
containing ice (approximately 250g). The resulting precipitate was collected,<br>
washed with water and dried in vacuo to give the title compound as a white solid<br>
(11.47g), m.p. 230-232°C, [a]D +94°C (c 0.91).<br>
Intermediate 2: 6a, 9a-difluoro-1ß-hydroxv-16a-methvl-3-oxo-17a-<br>
propionvloxy-androsta-1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid<br>
A solution of Intermediate 1 (5.0g) and triethylamine (6.15ml) in dichloromethane<br>
(140ml) was cooled with ice-salt and treated dropwise with propionyl chloride<br>
(4.74ml). The reaction mixture was stirred further at approximately 0°C for 0.75<br>
hours then washed successively with 2M sodium carbonate, water, 2M<br>
hydrochloric acid, water and brine. After being dried, solvent was removed to<br>
give a white solid (6.35g). This was redissolved in acetone (120ml) and<br>
diethylamine (12.5ml): after being stirred at room temperature for 1 hour the<br>
volume was reduced to approximately 75ml. The solution was poured into 2M<br>
hydrochloric acid (200ml) containing ice (approximately 300g) and the resulting<br>
precipitate was collected, washed with water and dried in vacuo to a white solid<br>
(5.17g) m.p. 152-155°C. Recrystallisation of a portion (400mg) from ethyl<br>
acetate gave the analytically pure title compound as colourless crystals (290mg),<br>
m.p. 161-164°C, [a]D -27°C (c 0.95).<br>
Intermediate 3: Methansulfonic acid 2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3R-yl ester<br>
Triethylamine (1.5vol, 1.1eq) and 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (0.012wt,<br>
0.01 eq) in ethylacetate (2vol) is added to a stirred solution of (R)-(+)-a-hydroxy-<br>
Y-butyrolactone (1wt, 1eq) in ethyl acetate (12vol) under nitrogen at 20°C +/-3°C.<br>
The solution is cooled to below 10°C and methanesulphonyl chloride (0.79vol,<br>
1.05eq) is cautiously added to the reaction mixture over a period of at least 15<br>
minutes at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature below 35°C.<br>
After complete addition, the reaction mixture is cooled to 20°C +/-3°C and stirred<br>
for up to 7h at 20°C +/-3°C under nitrogen, monitoring for completion by TLC<br>
(EtOAc, cyclohexane; 1:1; staining solution: 3g KMnO4, 20g K2CO3, 0.5g NaOH,<br>
and 300ml water) or GC. Upon completion, the reaction mixture is treated with<br>
1M HCI (3vol) and stirred until all solids have dissolved. The phases are<br>
separated and the organic phase is washed with further 1M HCI (3vol). The<br>
phases are separated and the organic phase is distilled under reduced pressure<br>
to approximately 4vol using a rotary evaporator. The organic solution is heated<br>
to 40-50°C and treated with cyclohexane (12vol). The mixture is cooled to below<br>
15°C and aged at 10-15°C for at least 15 minutes. The mixture is filtered, the<br>
collected solid is washed with cyclohexane (2x3vol) and dried under vacuum at<br>
30-35°C to yield the title compound as a white solid. Expected yield: 150%w/w,<br>
85%theory.<br>

approximately 45 minutes at a rate sufficient to maintain a reaction temperature<br>
of 25+/-5°C. A further portion of water (0.1 vol) was added as a line wash and<br>
the mixture was stirred at 22+/-3°C for 2 hours (note, the hydroxyacid product<br>
starts to crystallise after approximately 1 hour of this stir period). Water (14vol)<br>
was added to the suspension over at least 30 minutes maintaining a reaction<br>
temperature in the range 22+/-3°C. The mixture was cooled to approximately 10<br>
°C and stirred for at least 1 hour at this temperature. The solid was filtered off<br>
and the bed washed with water (2x3vol) at 22+/-5°C. The product was dried<br>
under vacuum at 60+/-5°C to afford hydroxyacid as a white granular solid<br>
(expected yield 97%th).<br>
Example 2: 6a, 9a-difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-16a-methyl-17a-propionyloxv-3-<br>
oxoandrosta-1, 4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid, S-fiuoromethyl ester<br>
The compound of Example 2 may be prepared from Intermediate 2 following the<br>
processes described in GB Patent No. 2288877B.<br>
Example 3: 6a, 9a-difluoro-11a-hvdroxy-16a-methvl-3-oxo-17a-propionvloxv-<br>
androsta-1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahvdro-furan-3-yl) ester<br>
A mixture of Intermediate 2 (1wt), Intermediate 3, and DMF (3.5vol) is treated<br>
with 2,4,6-collidine (0.268wt, 1.04eq). The resulting solution is heated at 39-<br>
43°C for approximately 4h until complete by HPLC. 2M Hydrochloric acid<br>
(0.2vol) is added and residual ethyl acetate is removed by vacuum distillation.<br>
The solution is warmed to 60°C and water (approximately 2vol) is added over 5-<br>
30 min at 60-65°C, seeding when a fine suspension has formed. The<br>
suspension is aged at 55-65°C for at least 5 min and water (approximately 8vol;<br>
total water added 10vol) is added slowly at 49-60°C. The suspension is allowed<br>
to cool to room temperature and is aged for at least 30min (typically overnight).<br>
The title compound is filtered off, washed with water (3 x 2vol), and pulled dry.<br>
The title compound is then purified using isopropanol recrystallisation, which<br>
comprises heating to reflux a suspension of the title compound in isopropanol<br>
(13.4 vol) and holding at reflux for at least 5 minutes. (At this stage the reaction<br>
mixture may be given a hot filtration). The solution is heated and maintained<br>
above 60°C whilst filtered, purified water (5.6vol) is added dropwise over at least<br>
10 minutes. The suspension is cooled to 0-10°C and then aged at 
least 30 minutes. The solid is collected by vacuum filtration, washed with filtered<br>
purified water (2 x 3.4vol) and dried under vacuum using a filter bed for at least<br>
15 minutes. The product is dried in vacuo at up to 70°C overnight. Expected<br>
yield: 99% w/w, 84% theory (uncorrected) from Intermediate 2.<br>
The merits of the present invention may be seen by reference to the following<br>
Comparative Example:<br>
Comparative Example<br>
Example was prepared following a procedure analogous to that described in J.<br>
Med. Chem. (1994), 37, 3717, example 2b, (half scale), which describes<br>
conversion of des-16 alpha methyl dexamethasone to corresponding<br>
hydroxyacid via a cold isolation.<br>
A suspension of flumethasone (5.42g, 13.2mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (27.5ml)<br>
and lab grade water (3ml) was treated with an solution of periodic acid (99%<br>
purity, 4.5g, 19.8mmol (1.5mole equivs)) in lab grade water (45ml) over a period<br>
of 15 minutes keeping the temperature in the range 20-30°C. The suspension<br>
was stirred at ambient for 2 hours and an essentially clear solution resulted.<br>
HPLC analysis at near 2 hours showed 98.9area% title compound present in the<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was then added to a stirred mixture of<br>
water (75ml) and crushed ice (125g) over 5 minutes. The suspension was then<br>
stirred at 0-2°C for 10 minutes and the solid was filtered off to give a very<br>
volumous gel (ca100ml).<br>
This comparative example resulted in a voluminous product with a high level of<br>
associated solvent and it was not possible to remove this solvent by<br>
conventional solvent removal techniques, such as low temperature filtration. By<br>
contrast, in Example 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D, the title compound was obtained in a<br>
relatively low volume (ca 4 ml) as a granular solid in a form which was readily<br>
filterable. In Example 1 which was performed on a larger scale the same low<br>
volume solid was obtained (ca 32 ml).<br>
Throughout the specification and the claims which follow, unless the context<br>
requires otherwise, the word "comprise, and variations such as "comprises and<br>
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step<br>
or group of integers but not to the exclusion of any other integer or step or group<br>
of integers or steps.<br>
