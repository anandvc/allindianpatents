A tank filled with full of water in which inverted a jar just touching on the water head. There is no upward force act on it but pushing it into water feel a heavy upward pressure act on it* If release the hand, the jar suddenly jumped upward and declining to release the air, completely, as bubles then it caoae down.<br>
Now the jar keep it at the bottom in the inverted position, without air in the jar. There is no action on it. Now use with straw to blow air into jar, the air bubles enter into jar and replace the water from the jar and moving upward ^U' shaped cleimp having holes at the end and the centre of the cleuap fixed nearing at the open end of the jar. The clamp mounted on the circular steel Disc with holes provided to fix the clamp and bolted tightly. The required number of jars are fixed with the circular steel Disc. These jars with circular steel Disc on any numbers required to be fixed with main shaft, at the centre of the steel Disc. As is required number of circular steel Disc with jars fitted on the main shaft, to be extended to the length of requirements on the one end of the mainshaft fitted with a fly wheel and bearings on the other end of the shaft a pully withbear|[ings has also fixed permanently.<br>
These assembly fixed into a water tank at the bottom, side wall holes are provided to fix the main shaft with assembly.<br>
COMPRESSOR UNIT<br>
^U' shaped clamp having holes at the end and the centre of the clamp fixed nearing at the open end of the jar. The clauap inserted on the hollow circular Disc and holes provided to fix the clamp and bolted tightly. As is four or any other rec[uired number of jars are fitted on the hollow-Disc. The closed end of jars and the hollow Disc connected with the txibe. At the time of rotation to make clockwise direction the jar at the top of the hollow Disc move downward and inverted, the open end to touch the water head inside of air in the jar compressed by the rotation and passes through the connected tube to the Hollow Disc. All the j ars are alternately touch the water head and compressed the air and passes through the Hollow Disc and the Hollow shaft. Then it passes through<br><br>
the cup joined with Inlet, ended below the air collection tank, liberate air bubles. The released air bubles from the main shaft jars are also collected and replace the water from the air collection tank. By this delivery of air and collection of released air and suction of air by the compressor unit are balanced with each other.<br>
Air Collection Tank open at the bottom, the top and other sides are closed. A delivery tube with stop cork mounted on the air collection tank. The tank fixed in between these two assembly when main shaft assembly liberates air bubles collected in the tank and compressor assembly has also liberates air bubles at the end of the inlet tube also collected and replace of water from the air collection tank. By this buoyancy of force acts upward in water, so the pressure in the tank developed. Open the stop cork the streatm of air released and liberates air bubles at the air collection point of jars. Increase in pressure will reduce the filling time of jars.<br>
Function of the Unit<br>
The present invention relates to Buoyancy of force acts upward in water. The mechanism according to the present invention consist of a water tank, air collection tank, compressor unit air collection jars with circular steel Disc, Mainshaft with flywheel and pully.<br>
To start the Buble motor open the stop cork, compressed air from the air collection tank or from the independent source of air passed through the delivery tube and liberated at the end of the holes suiteibly provided just beneath the main shaft circular Disc jar. The bottom portion of the jar having ^V or ^U' shaped mouth cutting, fecilitate to receive the liberation of air bubles from the end of the delivery tube. The air bubles entered and replace the water inside of the jar. The buoyancy of force acting upward the jar with disc moving upward to a certain degree of cyclic motion. Then next jar comes to the air collection point and replace the water into jar by the air bubles and moving upward. As is another jar has also come to air collection point receive the air bubles to replace water and moving upward by the upward pressure of water.<br><br>
After reaching the top of the disC/ the air from the jars are liberated because of the jars are declined by the rotation open end liberates the air and on vertical position no air In the jar Instead of which water will be entered and occupied the space and after jars are moving downward to reach the air collection point. In which air filled jars are moving upward by the upward pressure of water and water filled jars are coming downward by the edDsence of upward force. The rotation of disc with fly wheel and pully continuously running and at the same time the compressor Disc has also rotated. The flywheel, by the rotation, help to bring the jars Into the air collection point and regularise the speed constant.<br>
Jars are on the top of the malnshaft Disc and the following jars are released air (by decline to vertical position of jar movement) collected In the Air collection tank. The bottom of the tank open, other sides and the top of the tank was closed. In which water will be replaced by the collection of air, by this pressure will be developed in the tank by the buoyancy of force acting upward in water.<br>
The water head to be maintained on the above level of the air collection tank. The level of water head will be adjusted and maintained up to the Half of the compressor Hollow Disc only to be Immersed in water is essential.<br>
In the compressor unit the j ars are fixed on the Hollow Disc Just opposite direction of the malnshaft steel Disc jar position. By the opposite direction of fixing, jar movement at the top of the compressor. Hollow Disc, open end Inverted and moving downward to touch the water head, jars are vacant and filled with air. Then, by the rotation of Hollow Disc air into the jar compressed and moving to Hollow Disc and Hollow Shaft with delivery tube cup joined reach the Air collection temk. The chain of movement of the jar compressed air passing into air collection tank.<br>
By this volume of air delivered at the end are nearly equal to the volume of released air and the supply of air into collection tank by the compressor unit balanced with each other.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a method o£ operation to rxin the unit for which the unit consist of water tank in which compressor assembly, air collection tank, mainshaft with steel disc and with air collection jars mounted on it. The unit running with buoyancy of force acts upward in water.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure - 1    Shows a longitudinal section of the BUBLE<br>

and also extended outside of the tank, on which a<br>
fly wheel (9) fixed and inside of the tank circular<br>
steel Disc (12) with air collection jars fixed on<br>
the main shaft (10) with a pully (15).<br>
c.	The compressor shaft (4) solid on one side and the<br>
other side Hollow (27) from the circular Hollow<br>
Disc (10 mounted on the shaft and fitted with<br>
bearings the compressor jar mounted on the Hollow<br>
circular Disc (19) Holes (24) are provided on the<br>
Hollow shaft (27) in between the circular plates of<br>
