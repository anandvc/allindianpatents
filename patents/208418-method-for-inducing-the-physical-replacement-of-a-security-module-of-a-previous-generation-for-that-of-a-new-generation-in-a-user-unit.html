"METHOD FOR INDUCING THE PHYSICAL REPLACEMENT OF A SECURITY MODULE OF A PREVIOUS GENERATION FOR THAT OF A NEW<br>
GENERATION IN A USER UNIT"<br>
NAGRACARD   S.A.,   of 22,   Route   de   Geneve,   CH-1033   Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland                                                   <br><br>
466/MUM/2003<br>
The following specification, particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
5 JUN 2006<br><br>
METHOD TO PROMPT THE UPDATING OF AN EVOLUTIONARY<br>
PRODUCT<br>
The present invention concerns a method for the updating of an evolutionary product, particularly in the field of smart cards.<br>
All the operators that use electronic and computer systems are faced with the updating of their products and the management of compatibility between the different versions. This matter is very important as the number of these products is very big and they are distributed on a large scale.<br>
As these products are linked, even sporadically, to a management centre, the first approach of the operators has been to make this software modifiable by downloading. This technique has been possible thanks to the EEPROM or Flash memories that accept reprogramming and that do not need permanent powering.<br>
In this way, when new functions appear, the downloading of the new software in these products allows the users to benefit from these functions without having to return their products to any technical centre.<br>
In a one-way configuration, that is, a configuration in which only the link between the operator and the user is possible, it is difficult, even impossible, to determine if all the users have received the updating.<br>
Thus, the operators are forced to assume the compatibility with several versions in parallel so that the users that have not received the updating can benefit from the proposed service.<br>
This example can even be intensified when changing the generation of the product, that is, that a physical replacement of the product is necessary.<br>
For this purpose the operators send the users the new generation of the product with the invitation of using this new product in the place of the previous one.<br>
When it is an operator that proposes a payment service it is very difficult to impose the use of the new product suppressing all compatibility with the old<br><br><br>
product. This would provoke dissatisfaction in the clients who feel little interest in considerations of a technical nature.<br>
This is why the operators are at present constrained, out of fear of letting down their clients, to ensure not only the compatibility between the software versions, but also between the material generations. This compatibility is costly in pass-band terms when communicating with the products as the commands must be sent according to all the criteria of the different versions.<br>
The objective of the present invention is a method that prompts the user to update his/her product when it is possible, and not when the centre ceases to support the version used by the user causing the stopping of the service.<br>
This objective is achieved by a method consisting in determining the current version of the user's product and in comparing this version with the minimal intended version, and if the user's version is a previous one to the minimal version, producing a temporary visual prompt in the user's terminal.<br>
According to one embodiment, the product is a smart card that controls the access to a pay television. This card allows supplying the necessary information to decode the numerical flux and to manage the subscriptions to the different services offered by the operator. This card is connected to a pay television decoder that sends the decoded signals to a screen. The process intended to convince the user to change his/her card is started by the management centre that sends, by the classical communication means, a prompt inviting to update the subscriber's decoders.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, the service given to the user is not interrupted but momentarily interfered in order to prompt the user to change his/her card for a more recent version.<br>
According to a first embodiment, this interference or warning indication is carried out by adding a message on the screen during a short time in order to remind the user to change his/her card.<br><br>
This apparition can be done on command of the card itself and be repeated. The frequency of repetition can vary in time so that the warning indication becomes annoying to the user. In this way for example from one apparition per day it will be increased to one apparition per hour if no action is taken by the user.<br>
This warning indication is equally advantageously done when starting the decoder.<br>
Instead of a text message it is possible to add a pictogram, even a sequence of images describing the stages for changing the card.<br>
According to one embodiment, this warning indication is not done in the form of a message but in the form of a simulation of a momentary reception breakdown. All or part of the screen is briefly interfered with a notable effect on the user. The user will then be ready to replace his/her card as soon as possible so as not to see any more the images disappear before him/her.<br>
A simple means for doing this function is to use the control words necessary to decode the numerical flux. These control words are calculated by the card, precisely the one that has to be replaced. It is then possible for this card to not supply a word and to provoke the interference on the screen, the decoder being unable to decode the numerical flux.<br>
Alternatively this control word can be supplied with a delay, during which the screen will be interfered.<br>
It is possible to mix both warning indication means, that is, if the user does not react to the invitation made in the form of a message, the method of interference of the image will confirm the need to do the change.<br>
Other important aspects of the invention are the determination of the card's version and of the moment to perform the warning.<br>
Smart cards used in pay television decoders contain a relational database. Such an organisation is described in the document EP 0 616 714 and tells us that the base does not contain only the data but that it also contains programmes. Due to the  relational  organisation  of this  information  (data  and  programmes) it is<br><br><br>
necessary to carry out a request of information to determine which is the state of the version of the database.<br>
To determine the convenient moment to warn the user, several criteria have to be taken into account. It is clear that if the user is watching a film that he/she has especially purchased, it will be out of the question to interfere with the user's pleasure during this service. It will be best to choose emissions included in the basic subscription and with a low emotional character as opposed to a sports competition.<br>
The control centre, in this type of setting, does not only send a target version number as a minimal condition to not interfere the user's screen. The centre can also condition this version to the presence of certain programmes in the database.<br>
In the case where the control centre receives return information from the different decoders, it is possible for the centre to determine itself the cards that need an updating. The control centre has means to address each card nominatively to order it the starting of the invitation process to change. This process can be interrupted either by the actual changing of the card of by a command from the control centre.<br>
Other forms of warning, for example sonorous, can equally be used in the range of this invention.<br>
The use in a pay television system is not the only possible application. The generalisation of the pay services linked to Internet starts also security modules connected to user's computers. When a change is needed, for example to integrate new functions or to change a coding algorithm, the same problem is presented and the present invention allows to prompt the user to change the security module.<br>
This prompt will take the form of a message on the screen, a sound, or a graphical animation.<br>
Another possibility is to slow down the performances of the security module each time it is requested. Thus a slowing is performed of the functions of this module, a<br><br><br><br><br><br>
slowing that is accompanied by a message indicating the user the means to recover the original performances.<br>
The single Figure illustrates the system according to the invention that comprises a control centre 1 linked with one or several subscriber units composed of a receiver/decoder 2, a security module 3, and a screen 4. For the good functioning of the operations relating to the security of the received data 5, even the sent ones 6, the security module 3 is induced to supply the required keys or cryptograms.<br>
One embodiment consists in including in the updating prompt message an information telling the user that he/she will benefit from certain advantages or supplementary services after changing the security module. These advantages can be for example in the form of a supplementary credit, a free viewing of a film or an extension of the subscription period.<br>
In a two-way system (pay television, Internet) the updating of the module is detected by the control centre that receives the data from the new module by means of the return channel. The control centre then transmits the necessary data to the security module allowing the introduction of the advantages or supplementary services.<br>
In the case where there is no return channel (one-way) the changing of the module is not detected by the control centre. The data flux transmitted by the latter then contains specific data destined to the new module that includes functions that are ready to supply these advantages to the user. A variant of this implementation is possible by the introduction of conditions of granting supplementary services in the security module. From its starting it verifies the conditions of access giving the right to these supplementary services, and if these conditions are fulfilled in accordance with these services. They can have, for example, the form of a Supplementary subscription to a channel during a limited time of a month.<br><br>
