				<td>NANO-STRUCTURE SUPPORTED SOLID REGENERATIVE POLYAMINE<br><br>
AND POLYAMINE POLYOL ABSORBENTS FOR THE SEPARATION OF<br><br>
CARBON DIOXIDE FROM GAS MIXTURES INCLUDING THE AIR<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The invention relates to nano- structure supported (such as fumed silica, alumina and the like solid) regenerative polyamine-polyol absorbents for capturing and separating carbon dioxide from gas mixtures, including the air.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Climate change and global warming is considered one of the most pressing and severe environmental problems of today. It is now generally accepted that the main cause for global warming is the release of the so-called greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. A major greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released predominantly from combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas. Together, these fossil fuels supply about 80% of the energy needs of the world. Because fossil fuels are still relatively inexpensive and easy to use, and since no satisfactory alternatives are yet available to replace them on the enormous scale needed, fossil fuels are expected to remain our main source of energy in the long term. One way to mitigate CO2 emissions and their influence on the global climate is to efficiently and economically capture CO2 from its source, such as emissions from fossil fuel-burning power plants and other industrial factories, naturally occurring CO2 accompanying natural gas, and the air. Once captured, CO2 can be sequestered in geological formations or under the sea, or can be used as a raw material to synthesize fuel and synthetic hydrocarbons.<br><br>
Currently, separation and removal of CO2 from gas streams is achieved by techniques based on physical and chemical processes such as absorption by liquid solution systems, adsorption onto solid systems, cryogenic separation, and permeation through membranes. Among various CO2 separation techniques, amine solution-based CO2 absorption/desorption systems are one of the most suitable for capturing CO2 from high volume gas streams. Commonly used solvents in such systems are aqueous solutions of alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA), and methydiethanolamine (MDEA). Certain sterically <br><br>
hindered amines, such as 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol (AMP), can also be used as absorbents because of their high CO2 loading capacities. Of these, MEA is most widely used because of its high CO2 absorption rate, which allows use of shorter absorption columns. However, MEA system presents major drawbacks, including the large amount of heat required to regenerate the solvent and operational problems caused by corrosion and chemical degradation. To prevent excessive corrosion, typically only 10 to 30 weight % MEA is used in an aqueous amine solution, with the rest being water. Because the entire solution, of which 70 to 90% is water, must be heated to regenerate the MEA system, a lot of energy is wasted during the regeneration process. Other alkanolamine systems also present disadvantages. For example, secondary and hindered amines (e.g., DEA,<br><br>
DIPA, AMP) provide more moderate CO2 absorption rates than MEA, and are also prone to corrosion and chemical degradation. MDEA is known to absorb CO2 only at a slow rate. Formulations formed by blending several alkanolamines are of interest because they can combine favorable characteristics of various compounds while suppressing in part their unfavorable characteristics. A number of blended alkanolamine solutions have been developed, and the most common blends are MDEA-based solution containing MEA or DEA. However, blended alkanolamine solutions do not eliminate the drawbacks of amine solution-based systems.<br><br>
CO2 can also be captured by adsorption on solid sorbents. Solids are typically used as a physical adsorbent for separation of CO2. Such processes are based on the ability of porous solids to reversibly adsorb certain components in a mixture. The solids can have a large distribution of pore size, as in silica gel, alumina, and activated carbon, or a pore size controlled by the crystal structure, e.g., zeolites. At low temperatures like room temperature, zeolite-based adsorbents have high CO2 absorption capacities (e.g., 160 mg CO2/g for zeolite 13X and 135 mg CO2/g for zeolite 4A at 25°C in pure CO2). However, the adsorption capacities of these adsorbents decline rapidly with increasing temperature. Further, because gases are only physically adsorbed on the adsorbents, actual separation of an individual gas from a mixture of gases is low.<br><br>
To achieve a higher selectivity for CO2 adsorption, a compound providing chemical absorption can be applied on the solid adsorbent. For this purpose, an amine or polyamine can be deposited or grafted onto a solid support. Amines and polyamines chemically bound (grafted) on the surface of solids, such as silicas and alumina-silicas, however, show limited absorption capacity of less than 80 mg CO2/g and, in most cases, <br><br>
less than 50-60 mg CO2/g absorbent. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,087,597 to Leal et al. discloses a method for chemisorption of CO2 at room temperature using silica gel having a surface area between 120 and 240 m2/g, which is modified with a polyalkoxysilane containing one or more amino moieties in its structure. The material is disclosed to be capable of absorbing between 15 and 23 mg of dry CO2 per gram of absorbent. U.S. Patent No. 6,547,854 to Gray et al. discloses a method for preparing amine-enriched sorbents by incorporating the amine onto the surface of oxidized solids. The reported maximum amount of CO2 absorbed on these solids is 7.7 mg/g absorbent using a gas mixture of 10% CO2 in He. As is evident from the data, the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed on the grafted amino group on various solid supports remains relatively low, because of their low amine coverage.<br><br>
A more promising pathway involves impregnating a solid support with amines or polyamines. For example, a paper by S. Satyapal et al ., J. Energy and Fuels 15:250 (2001) describe the development of polyethylenimine (PEI)/polyethylene glycol (PEG) on a high surface area polymethylmethacrylate polymeric support. This solid is currently used in space shuttles to remove CO2 from the cabin atmosphere and release it into the space. Its capacity is approximately 40 mg CO2/g absorbent at 500C and 0.02 atm. CO2. This material and its modifications are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,364,938; 5,876,488; 5,492,683; and 5,376,614 to Birbara et al. The preferred supports described in these patents are of polymeric nature, with acrylic ester resins such as AMBERLITE® being described as having particularly suitable characteristics. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,376,614; 5,492,683; and 5,876,488 also disclose other possible supports, including alumina, zeolite and carbon molecular sieves. According to U.S. Patent Nos. 5 ,492,683 and 5,376,614, however, the amount of amine present on the sorbent is limited, ranging from 1 wt. % to 25 wt. %.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,810,266 to Zinnen et al. discloses a method for creating CO2 sorbents by treating carbon molecular sieves with amine alcohols. This patent discloses that mono ethanol amine (MEA)-based materials are not stable and release MEA during the regeneration step at higher temperatures. International Publication No. WO 2004/054708 discloses absorbents based on mesoporous silica supports. The active components for CO2 absorption are amines or mixture thereof chemically connected or physically adsorbed on the surface of the mesoporous silicas. Absorption on most of the absorbents described in this publication is below 70 mg CO2/g. The best results are <br><br>
obtained by using diethanolamine (DEA), which is physically adsorbed on the support (about 130 mg CO2Zg). However, because of the volatility of DEA under the desorption conditions, the effectiveness of this absorbent generally decrease with increasing number Of CO2 absorption-desorption cycle (about 16.8% after 5 cycles at a moderate regeneration temperature of only 600C). U.S. Patent No. 6,908,497 to Sirwardane et al. discloses a method for preparing sorbents by treating a clay substrate having a low surface area of 0.72 to 26 mg2/g with an amine and/or ether.<br><br>
Alcohols, polyethylene glycol and other oxygenated compounds have also been used for decades for acid gas removal, mainly CO2 and H2S. For example, SELEXOL® from Union Carbide (now Dow Chemicals) and SEPASOLV MPE® from BASF are used in commercial processes. Oxygenated compounds in combination with amines as mixed physical or chemical sorbents, in a process such as a glycol-amine process, have also been used for many years for acid gas removal (see Kohl, A. L. and Nielsen, R. B., GAS PURIFICATION 5th ed. (Gulf Publishing Co.)). U.S. Patent No. 4,044,100 to McElroy demonstrates the use of mixtures of diisopropanolamine and dialkyl ethers of a polyethylene glycol for removing gases, including CO2 from gaseous streams. The use of ethylene glycol to improve the absorption and desorption of CO2 from amines has also been studied by J. Yeh et al., Energy and Fuels 15, pp. 274-78 (2001). While the literature mainly relates to the use of amines and oxygenated compounds in the liquid phase, the use of oxygenated compounds to improve characteristics of gas sorbents in the solid phase has also been explored. S. Satyapal et al., Energy and Fuels 15 :250 (2001) mentions the use of polyethylene glycol in conjunction with polyethyleneimine on a polymeric support to remove CO2 from the closed atmosphere of a space shuttle. X. Xu et al., Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 62:29 (2003) shows that polyethylene glycol incorporated in a mesoporous MCM-41 / polyethyleneimine sorbent improves the CO2 absorption and desorption characteristics of the tested material. Preparation and performance of a solid absorbent consisting of PEI deposited on a mesoporous MCM-41 is also disclosed (see X. Xu et al., Energy and Fuels 16: 1463 (2002)). U.S. Patent Nos. 5,376,614 and 5,492,683 to Birbara et al. use polyols to improve absorption and desorption qualities of the absorbents.<br><br>
Another new material for trapping carbon dioxide are metal organic framework compounds. A preferred compound known as MOF-177 (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2005, 127, <br><br>
17998) has a room temperature carbon dioxide capacity of 140 weight percent at a relatively high pressure of 30 bar.<br><br>
As these disclosures show, there is a need for an improved sorbent for capturing CO2, which is efficient, economical, readily available and regenerative, and which provides a high removal capacity at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. In addition, an efficient absorption system that solves the corrosion and evaporation problems of the existing technologies is needed.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides supported amine sorbents comprising an amine or an amine/polyol composition deposited on a nano-structured support, which provide structural integrity and increased CO2 absorption capacity.<br><br>
The support for the amine and amine/polyol compositions is composed of a nano- structured solid. The nano-structured support can have a primary particle size less than about 100 nm, and can be nanosilica, fumed or precipitated oxide, calcium silicate, carbon nanotube, or a mixture thereof. The amine can be a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine or alkanolamine, aromatic amine, mixed amines or combinations thereof. In an example, the amine is present in an amount of about 25% to 75% by weight of the sorbent. The polyol can be selected from, for example, glycerol, oligomers of ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxides, and ethers, modifications and mixtures thereof, and can be provided in an amount up to about 25% by weight of the sorbent.<br><br>
According to an embodiment, the sorbent is regenerative. The sorbent can be desorbed and regenerated by applying heat, reduced pressure, vacuum, gas purge, lean sweep gas, or a combination thereof.<br><br>
The invention also relates to preparation of the sorbent and the particular use of the sorbent for capturing and separating carbon dioxide from a gas source. The carbon dioxide can be released and used to produce methanol. The method comprises reduction of carbon dioxide and water, or reduction of carbon dioxide under conditions sufficient to produce an intermediate compound followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the intermediate compound with hydrogen to form methanol.<br><br>
In one embodiment, methanol is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of an intermediate compound, e.g., methyl formate, wherein the hydrogen used in the hydrogenation <br><br>
is obtained by electrolysis of water obtained from the air. In another embodiment, methanol is produced by reducing the carbon dioxide under conditions sufficient to carbon monoxide, reacting the carbon monoxide with methanol under conditions sufficient to obtain methyl formate, and catalytically hydrogenating the methyl formate under conditions sufficient to produce methanol.<br><br>
Methanol produced according to the invention can be further processed to any desired derivative or modified compounds. For example, methanol can be dehydrated to produce dimethyl ether, which can also be further treated under conditions sufficient to form compounds such as ethylene and propylene. Ethylene and propylene can be converted to higher olefins, a synthetic hydrocarbons, aromatics, or related products, and therefore are useful as a feedstock for chemicals or as transportation fuel.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, methanol can be further used for microbiological production of single cell proteins.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
The invention relates to regenerative supported sorbents for absorbing CO2. The sorbent comprises an amine on a nano-structured support, e.g., a nanosilica support, for absorbing and desorbing CO2. CO2 can be absorbed from any desired source, including industrial exhausts, flue gases of fossil fuel-burning power plants, as well as natural sources. The nano-structured support according to the invention provides structural integrity to the amine as well as a high surface area for solid-gas contact. A polyol can also be added to the supported amine sorbent to enhance its CO2 absorption capabilities and CO2 absorption rates.<br><br>
It has been unexpectedly discovered that certain carriers of nano-scale particles, particularly silica nanoparticles (nanosilica), have exceptional qualities as support for amines, polyamines, polymeric amines, and modifications thereof, for the absorption of CO2. The sorbent with nano-scale support according to the invention provides significant advantages over the absorbents of the prior art, e.g., absorbents having a polymeric support, including a high CO2-selectivity and removal capacity at ambient and elevated temperatures. Thus, the present sorbent allows selective capture and separation of CO2 from various gas mixtures under various conditions and temperatures. The present sorbent is also easy to regenerate and recycle at ambient to moderate temperatures, enabling multiple absorption-desorption cycles with no or minimal loss of <br><br>
activity. The sorbent also addresses the corrosion and evaporation problems of the prior art absorbents. Further, unlike certain prior art sorbents which can contain amine only in an amount of 1 wt. % to 25 wt. %, the nanoparticle-based amine sorbent according to the invention can contain a significantly higher amount of amine, e.g., between about 25 wt. % and 75 wt. %.<br><br>
Thus, the present sorbent system is practical for separating CO2 from industrial effluent gases such as those from fossil fuel-burning power plants and other industrial factories, as well as other gas streams, particularly natural gas containing significant CO2 concentrations. Significantly, the sorbent can also be used to separate CO2 from the atmospheric air.<br><br>
The sorbent according to the invention is suggested to absorb CO2 by the following mechanism. Upon contact with a gaseous stream containing CO2, the supported amine chemically absorbs CO2 by forming a carbamate complex.<br><br>
2 RiR2NH + CO2  RiR2N CO2" • +H2NRiR2<br><br>
Carbamate<br><br>
In the presence of water, the carbamate further reacts to form a bicarbonate and releases the amine, which can further react with CO2, thereby increasing the overall CO2absorption capacity.<br><br>
RiR2N CO2" ^ +H2NRiR2 + H2O  HCO3" ^ +H2NRiR2 + RjR2NH<br><br>
Bicarbonate<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the absorbed CO2 can be readily desorbed and the supported amine can be regenerated. The desorption of CO2 and regeneration of the sorbent can be achieved by modest heating of the sorbent, applying reduced pressure or vacuum, gas purge, and/or a carbon dioxide lean sweep gas, which releases CO2 from the sorbent. The ready regeneration enables the sorbent to undergo repeated absorption-desorption cycles with ease. Advantageously, a large variety of amine- and ether-based compounds can be used on the present nano-structured support.<br><br>
Amines that can be used in the invention include primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl- and alkanolamines, aromatic amines, mixed amines, and combinations thereof. Primary and secondary amines are the most active for CO2 absorption. The <br><br>
amine absorbent should, therefore, preferably contain a sufficient amount of primary and secondary amino components. The amino components should also have low volatility to avoid or minimize loss of amine, which would contaminate the gas stream and decrease the effectiveness of the absorption system over time. Examples of amino components include but are not limited to monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), methyldiethanolamine, 2-(2-aminoethylamino)-ethanol, diisopropanolamine, 2-amino-2-methyl-l, 3 -propanediol, triethanolamine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylene-hexamine, polyethyleneimine, and the likes, including various polymeric amine compounds and mixtures thereof. Polyethyleneimines are preferred because of their high proportion of secondary and primary amino functionalities and their low volatility. Polyethyleneimines also provide a high nitrogen/carbon ratio beneficial for maximizing the amount of amino functionalities in the absorbent. Polyethyleneimines having molecular weight greater than 600 are especially preferred. The amine content in the sorbent can be about 25% to about 75% of the total weight of the sorbent. To enhance the CO2 absorption and desorption characteristics of the supported amine sorbent, polyols can be incorporated in the sorbent composition, in an amount up to 25% of the total weight of the sorbent. The additions of polyols improves the absorption and desorption of the sorbent, and decreases the viscosity of the amines, allowing CO2 to have better access to the active amino sites of the sorbent even at lower temperatures (
<br>
The support according to the invention is a material having primary particle sizes less than 1,000 nm, preferably less than about 100 nm. Preferred supports are nanosilica, especially so-called fumed silica and precipitated silica. Fumed silica typically has a primary particle size ranging from 5 to 50 nm and a specific surface area between 50 and 500 m2/g. Fumed silica is generally prepared by vapor phase hydrolysis <br><br>
of a silicon-bearing halide, such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4). Examples of commercially available fumed silica include AEROSIL® from Degussa, CAB-O-SIL® from Cabot, and REOLOSIL® from Tokuyama. Precipitated silica is formed from aqueous solutions by reaction of an alkaline silicate (e.g., sodium silicate) with a mineral acid (e.g., sulfuric acid) under stirring. Primary particles formed by this method are generally between 3 and 50 nm in size. These primary particles can subsequently aggregate to form larger micron size particles. The specific surface area of precipitated silica generally ranges from 50 to 500 m2/g. Examples of commercially available precipitated silica include HI-SIL® from PPG Industries and FINESIL® and TOKUSIL® from Tokuyama.<br><br>
Fumed silica and precipitated silica have the appearance of a lightweight, fluffy, white powder. Their small particle size allows them to absorb and retain significant amounts of amines while maintaining free flowing powder characteristics without caking. Another advantage of fumed and precipitated silicas is their non-toxicity. The non-toxicity allows them to be used in food processing, e.g., as anti-caking additives in powdered food products such as milk substitutes, and in cosmetic products, e.g., in abrasive material in a toothpaste. Fumed and precipitated silicas are generally hydrophilic, but their surface can be treated to produce hydrophobic silicas. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic silicas, as well as other modified silicas, are all suitable for use as the nano-structured amine support according to the invention.<br><br>
Other nano-structured materials suitable for use in the present amine sorbents include fumed or precipitated oxides such as fumed aluminum oxide, fumed zirconium oxide, and fumed titanium oxide, precipitated aluminum oxide, precipitated titanium oxide, precipitated zirconium oxide, calcium silicate, carbon nanotubes, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The supported amine sorbent can be prepared by impregnation or by another conventional technique. For example, when impregnation is used, the nano-structured support material is mixed or dispersed in a suitable solvent and maintained as a suspension by stirring. A separate amine solution is prepared by completely dissolving the amine in the solvent. The nano-structured support and the amine solution are then combined under stirring. Preferably, the amine solution is added stepwise to the suspension of the support to ensure good dispersion of the amine on the surface of the support. The solvent is then removed to form the supported amine sorbent. The <br><br>
resulting amine sorbent can be used as is or can be crushed and sieved to obtain a uniform powder.<br><br>
Polyols can be added to enhance the absorption/desorption characteristics of the supported amine sorbent. When a polyol is used, the polyol can be mixed together with the amine solution and added to the suspension of the support. The polyol can also be separately dissolved in the solvent and combined with the suspension of the support. In that case, the polyol solution is preferably added first to the suspension of the support, and the solvent is then removed to obtain the supported polyol material. The obtained solid is then dispersed in the solvent and a solution of the amine in the solvent is added under stirring. Finally, solvent is removed to form the supported amine/polyol sorbent. The sorbent can be used as is or can be crushed and sieved to obtain a uniform powder.<br><br>
Any solvent which is capable of dissolving, but which does not react with, the amine and the polyol can be utilized. The solvent should preferably be easily separated from the sorbent by mild heating and/or vacuum. Preferred solvents include but are not limited to alcohols, which can dissolve amines and polyols and can be easily removed from the sorbent. For example, methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol, and various mixtures thereof can be used.<br><br>
The methods for preparing amine supported sorbents according to the invention are inexpensive and easy to carry out, yet produce sorbents that are superior to the sorbents prepared by previously known methods.<br><br>
Advantageously, the invention enables a wide range of CO2 absorbing capabilities for use with various natural and industrial gas sources. The absorption can be performed under various conditions, e.g., over a temperature range of 0 to 1000C, and in any suitable manner, e.g., in a regular flow system or in a fixed, moving, or fluidized absorption bed. The ability of the sorbent to capture CO2 can be demonstrated by measuring absorption by thermogravimetry (TGA) or by measuring CO2 absorption under static conditions.<br><br>
Once the bulk of the amines, e.g., about 70 to 90%, is complexed with CO2, the sorbent can be regenerated. As used herein, the term "regeneration" or "regenerative" is understood to mean that the sorbent can be re-used by releasing or desorbing the absorbed gas from the sorbent. The absorbed gas is released by treating the sorbent with any process that effects the release, e.g., heating, reduced pressure, vacuum, gas purge, and combinations thereof. Thus, the regenerated sorbent according to the invention can <br><br>
be used repeatedly, through multiple absorption-desorption cycles. In an example, the sorbent maintains its absorption efficiency even after repeated absorption-desorption cycles. Preferably, the sorbent maintains its absorption efficiency for many absorption- desorption cycles. It is convenient to use parallel absorption beds, which allow absorption and desorption/regeneration to be carried out continuously.<br><br>
For example, for a CO2 sorbent, the regeneration is endothermic, so the absorbed CO2 is released by subjecting the absorbent to elevated temperature (e.g., by heating the sorbent at temperatures from about 25°C to about 1200C), reduced pressure (e.g., by pressure swing absorption (PSA)), gas purge, vacuum, lean gas sweep, or any combinations thereof. The regeneration treatment allows essentially most of the CO2 that is complexed with the amine of the sorbent to be released. The CO2 can then be stored or used in any desired manner, and the sorbent freed (regenerated) from CO2 is reused in further CO2 absorption-desorption cycles.<br><br>
Uses and reactions of CO2 include those mentioned above and as further disclosed in co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 60/837,273 filed August 10, 2006, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br><br>
The sorbent according to the invention is thermally stable and does not release the supported amine in the temperature and/or pressure range of the absorption operation. Further, because it is capable of regeneration and effective operation at a temperature range that can be easily maintained throughout the process, the sorbent is cost-effective for providing a high efficacy and a long life span, in addition to a high selectivity and capacity for CO2 capture and separation. Because of its flexibility and versatility, the sorbent can also advantageously be used to treat large volumes of CO2- containing gases from various sources.<br><br>

The following examples are illustrative only and should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br><br>
Example I. Preparation of a supported amine sorbent<br><br>
This example illustrates preparation of a supported amine sorbent composed of 50 wt. % polyethylenimine and 50 wt. % fumed silica having an average primary particle size of 7 nm and a specific surface area of 390 m2/g +/- 40 m2/g. <br><br>
Polyethylenimine (molecular weight Mw of 25,000) 4 g was dissolved in 25 rnL of methanol. This solution was then added drop-wise under stirring to 4 g fumed silica in suspension in 100 mL methanol to ensure good dispersion of polyethylenimine on the support. The mixture was stirred for an additional hour, and the solvent was then removed from the mixture by heating at 500C under vacuum on a rotovap followed by overnight vacuum (
<br>
Example II. Preparation of a supported amine/polyol sorbent This example illustrates preparation of a supported amine/polyol sorbent composed of 45 wt. % polyethylenimine, 10 wt. % polyethylene glycol, and 45 wt. % fumed silica of having an average primary particle size of 7 nm with a specific surface area of 390 m2/g +/- 40 m2/g.<br><br>
Polyethylene glycol (molecular weight Mw of 400) 2 g was dissolved in 25 mL of methanol. This solution was then added drop-wise to 9 g fumed silica suspended in 200 mL methanol, under stirring, to ensure good dispersion of polyethylene glycol on the support. The mixture was then stirred for an additional hour. Thereafter, the solvent was removed from the mixture by heating at 500C under vacuum on a rotovap, followed by overnight vacuum (
<br>
5.5 g of the obtained polyol/support was mixed with 50 mL methanol. To this mixture, 4.5 g polyethylenimine (molecular weight Mw of 25,000) dissolved in 50 mL methanol was added stepwise to ensure good dispersion of polyethylenimine on the polyol/support. The solution was then mixed under brisk stirring for an additional hour. Thereafter, the solvent was removed from the mixture by heating at 500C under vacuum on a rotovap followed by overnight vacuum (
<br>
Example III. Preparation of a supported amine/polyol sorbent<br><br>
The same procedure described in Example II was used to prepare a sorbent composed of 47.5 wt. % polyethyleminine (molecular weight Mw of 25,000), 10 wt. % polyethylene glycol (molecular weight Mw of 400), and 42.5 wt. % fumed silica having a <br><br>
primary particle size of 7 nm. The obtained polyol/ amine supported sorbent was a white solid, which was ground and sieved to produce a uniform powder. The powder had excellent flow characteristics.<br><br>
Example IV. Measurement of CO2 absorption capacity using a static system<br><br>
CO2 absorption data was obtained using an apparatus composed of glass tubes connected to a gas delivery and vacuum system. C?2-containing gases were passed over pre-weighed amounts of absorbents prepared according to the invention. The weight increase of the absorbent was monitored until saturation, i.e., until there was no further weight increase. CO2 absorption was determined by the increase in weight. Desorption of CO2 was achieved by heating the sample at 80 to 1100C under vacuum (
<br>
The absorption measurements obtained with some of the absorbents are summarized in Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1. CO2 absorption capacity measurements under static conditions<br><br><br>
PEI (HMW): polyethylenimine of molecular weight Mw ca. 25,000 PEI (LMW): polyethylenimine of molecular weight Mw ca. 800 PEG: polyethylene glycol Mn ca. 400 <br><br>
Example V. Measurement of CO2 absorption capacity using a thermogravimetric analyzer<br><br>
CO2 absorption data was obtained using a thermogravimetric analyzer (Shimadzu TCA-50). The powdered absorbent (5-20 mg) was loaded into a platinum crucible and placed on the instrument balance. The solid absorbent was then pretreated at the desired temperature, generally 90 to 1100C for 1 hr under a flow of nitrogen. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to the desired absorption temperature and the gas flow switched to either CO2 or a mixture of CO2 in different proportions with other gases (e.g., N2, O2, natural gas, etc.). The change in mass in the sample was recorded over time to determine the CO2 absorption capacity. Examples of absorption measurements obtained with this method for the absorbent prepared according to Example III (47.5 wt. % PEI, 10 wt. % PEG and 42.5 wt. % fumed silica) are summarized in Table 2.<br><br>
Table 2. Measurement at 5O0C of CO2 absorption capacity of an absorbent composed of 47.5% PEI, 10% PEG and 42.5% nano-structured fumed silica1 using a thermogravimetric analyzer<br><br><br>
1 PEI: polyethylenimine of molecular weight Mw ca. 25,000 PEG: polyethylene glycol Mn ca. 400<br><br>
Example VI. Repeated absorption-desorption cycles<br><br>
The solid sorbent of Example III was subjected to multiple cycles of absorption and desorption, and absorption-desorption cycles were measured using the static experimental conditions described in Example IV (with 3 minutes for absorption at room temperature with pure carbon dioxide and 10 minutes for desorption at 1100C). The CO2 absorption capacity of the absorbent remained unchanged after ten absorption- desorption cycles (see Table 3). The data shows that the sorbent according to the invention is capable of a number of repeated absorption-desorption cycles without <br><br>
diminished absorption capacity and can be used well over ten absorption-desorption cycles.<br><br><br>
