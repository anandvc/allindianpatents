				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for manufacture of high iron hydraulic cement clinker using down draft sintering technique.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
High iron cement clinker is a non-portland type of cement clinker which contains iron (Fe2O3}) to the extent of 40% and above as major chemical constituent. The cement made from high iron cement clinker possesses clearly and high binding strength on hydration. This type of high iron hydraulic cement is usable as a substitute to Portland cement in construction activities, a special cement in sulphate resistance constructions, a metallurgical cement or binder in briquetting, pelletisation and sintering of iron ore, iron oxide and metal containing fines for iron making and a hydraulic mineral binder for absorbing water soluble metals in treatment and stabilization of hazardous toxic solid wastes.<br>
Portland and aluminous cements are known cementitious systems in which calcium silicates and calcium aluminates respectively are the major cement mineral phases. Iron (Fe2O3) content in these cements are very low and ranges 2 to 6% in Portland cement and up to 15% (maximum) in aluminous cement. Iron and iron bearing mineral phases existing in these cementitious systems are quite insignificant in respect to quantity and cement property. Chemically and mineralogically the high iron cement is quite different from the Portland and aluminous cements. Iron (Fe2O3) in high iron cement is beyond the limit of the above two cements. Mainly, the calcium-iron and calcium-alumina-iron type of ferric phases are the major mineral constituents of high iron cement clinker responsible for developing hydraulic property and strength of the cement. Hydraulic property and development of strength of high iron cement largely depend on the mineral structure and degree of solid solution of different ferrite phase, crystallinity and presence of different calcium silicate and other mineral phases.<br>
In high iron cement clinker, the formation of different ferrite mineral phases mainly depend on the chemical parameters of calcium, alumina and iron; sintering and cooling<br>
conditions.<br>
Comparatively, ferrite mineral phases of high iron cement clinker form at much lower temperature than the calcium silicates of the Portland cement clinkers. In respect to hydraulic property and strength, the performance of high iron cement is also better than the Portland cement. Lime and iron bearing raw materials are the main source for manufacture of high iron cement. Owing to the many advantageous qualities like cost effectiveness, energy efficiency and better  performance  of high iron cement than  the  Portland cement, the<br><br>
development of suitable processes in production of high iron cement clinker in the present context has been given more attention.<br>
At present, iron rich solid wastes are abundantly available in different metallurgical, chemical and mining industries. Accumulation of these wastes without proper use is a significant problem in respect of the environmental pollution caused. Thus, use of these types of.waste materials may find a suitable value-added application in making high iron cerrtents. Although some research activities have been carried out in past in this area but technological development in production of high iron cement has not been made significant progress.<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the homogeneous raw mixture is prepared in semi-wet or dry form by blending or grinding depending the particle fineness.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chemical ratio of CaO/(Al2O3+Fe203), SiO2/(Al2O3+Fe2O3) and (A2O3+Fe2O3) in the homogenized raw mixture is between 1.3 to 2.5, 0,2 to 0.5 and 0.25 to 0.8 respectively.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the particle fineness of the homogenized raw mixture is below 150mesh (100 micron) size.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the content of solid carbon ranges 4 to ] 2% in the homogenized mixture as feed to generate in-situ heat for sintering.<br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention, the clinkertsed lumpy aggregates are crushed for size reduction and then ground with or without gypsum and other additives to make cements and binders for different applications.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a mineralizing agent selected from sulphate, fluorine, chlorine bearing minerals and chemical wastes is added to the raw mixture. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The process details of the present invention are as follows:<br>
Limestone, lime, lime sludge, lime bearing solid wastes, iron ore, slime red mud, ferruginuous bauxite, laterite, clay, iron oxide containing metallurgical and chemical wastes, slag, coke breeze, coal char, carbonaceous sludge, carbon bearing solid wastes are the different types of raw materials suitable for use in manufacture of high iron cement clinkers.<br><br>
Sulphate, fluorine, chlorine bearing minerals and chemical wastes are also usable as mineralizing agent in the process Iron is a major constituent of the high iron cement of which iron content is beyond the limit of Portland and aluminous cement. Norms for chemical parameters in designing the raw mix for high iron cement is also different than the Portland and aluminous cements. Based on the content of CaO, Fe2o3, AI2O3, S1O2, carbon etc. of various materials and additives, it is mixed in different properties accordingly to maintain the essential chemical parameters such as 1.3 to 2.5 of CaO (A^Os+FezCh), 0.2 to 0.5 of S1O2 (A)203+Fe203), 0.25 to 0.8 of Al203+Fe203, 4 to 12% of carbon and with or without mineralizing agent in preparation of high iron cement raw mixtures. Depending on the particle fineness, moisture content and nature of materials, the raw mixture may be prepared in dry or semi dry from the blending or by grinding for complete homogenization. Particle fineness of the homogenized raw mixture is maintained preferable below 100 micron size. The homogenized raw mixture is then subjected to make pelletised particles of below 15 mm size granules by the pelletisation technique in the presence of water. Pelletisation condition is maintained in such a manner that the pelletised particles retain less than 15% water and green strength for handling in sintering operation. Sintering of the pelletised particles is carried out by the down draft sintering system to convert into cement clinkers. Principles of Down Draft Sintering (DDS) system is commercially known in iron and steel industries for agglomeration of iron ore fines for blast furnace use in making iron. The granulated material of the cement raw mix is charged into the sintering hearth which is like a pot consisting of grate bars at the bottom. The charge material rests on a false hearth (50 mm thick) layer over the grate bar in form of a bed ranging 300 to 600 mm thickness. Top of the charge material bed in the sintering hearth is ignited by using burners or pre-burnt coal or coke to create heat front. Air suction pressure between 100 to 1000 mm WG is maintained below the grate bars to move the heat front 15 to 20 mm per minute from top to bottom of the bed. Drying calcinations, sintering and then cooling of the material in formation of clinker takes place on a static bed. Presence of solid carbon within the charge material generates in-situ heat ranging 1000 to 1500°C or higher temperature in the bed. Conversion of charge bed into cement clinker takes 15 to 30 minutes time depending on the height and permeability of the charge bed, air suction pressure, sintering temperature etc. Clinkersied product discharged from the sinter pot is crushed to below 10 mm sizes to store or to use in grinding to make cement.<br>
Based on the raw mix composition and presence of sulphate chloride, fluorite bearing additive, the high iron cement clinker produced by the above method contains C2F, C4AF, C6AF2 and C6A2F mineral structures of ferrite compounds, di- and tri-calcium silicates, and<br><br>
calcium sulphoaluminate (C4A3S), calcium fluoroaluminate (CuA-CaF2), calcium chloroaluminate (C11A7CICI2), calcium sulphoaluminogerrite (C2AxF1-xSa), [where x varies between 0.1 to 0.8 and n varies 0.05 to 0.5] as the assemblage of different cement mineral phase [C-CaO, F- Fe2O3, A- AI2O3, S-SO4]. Ferrite phases ranging 30 to 70% in association with dicalcium silicate silicate or tricalcium as the primary mineral constituents occur in the high iron cement clinker Other minerals like C4AS, CnA-CaF2, C11A-CaCl2, and calcium sulpho aluminoferrite also exist in different proportions with the ferrite phase depending the nature of additives and fluxes.<br>
Sintering and cooling operation of down draft sintering (DDS) methods is very fast than the other existing cement clinkerization system, which promotes to maintain micro-crystallinity of different cement mineral phases and higher degree of solid solution of ferrite minerals in the clinker. High hydraulic strength of cement is related to the composition and crystallinity of various cement mineral phases. Particularly the high iron cement clinkers made in the present process mainly acicularto tabular shape ferrite mineral phases of below 10 micron sizes and dicalcium and tricalcuim silicate crystals of below 40 micron sizes and solid solution of C6AF2 and C6A2F ferrite mineral structures. Due to the special features of mineralogical and microstructural characteristics in the strength of microstructural characteristics in the high iron cement clinker consisting of 40% iron and above help to achieve hydraulic strength as high as 120 MPa in the cement after 28 days of curing. Further, the formulation of high iron cement clinker is mostly by solid state reaction of particles with minimum fusion which helps to retain spongy and porous character for easier grinding to cement fineness.<br>
Laboratory scale down draft sintering (DDS) system consisting of rectangular box type sintering hearth of size (300 x 300) mm cross section area and 500 mm height of capacity of feed 50 to 60 kg of granulated raw mix per batch has been adapted in conducting the experiments at different bed height, suction pressure, sintering and cooling rate on various compositions to optimize the process for commercial production of high iron cement clinker.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1<br>
Dry powdery materials of acetylene plant lime sludge [63.25% CaO], blast furnace (B.F.) dust [46.70% Fe2O3] 7.24% Si02 and 30.17% carbon] and additives are mixed to make 50 kg raw material mixture in which the weight ratio of lime sludge and B.F. dust is 2:1. The blended materials are pulverized in a ball mill for homogenization and to maintain below 150<br><br>
mesh (BSS) particle fineness. The homogenized raw mixture consists of 1.96, 0.21 and 0.31 as the chemical ratio of CaO^AljOj+FejOs), SiCVCAhOs+FeaOs) and AljOj+Fe^Os respectively. The homogenized raw mixture is then pelletised in presence of water by a disc granulator to make below ] 5 mm size granules consisting of 10% water. Bulk density of the green granulated particle is 1250 kg/m"', 50 kg of the green granulated material is charged into a sintering hearth of (300 mm x 300 mm) cross - section and 500 mm height like a box to make 450 mm thick bed in a laboratory set up DDS unit. Top of the bed is ignited by burning charcoal on it and 350 mm water gauge (WG) air suction pressure is applied below the charge bed to complete the sintering and cooling operation in 30 minutes to prepare iron cement clinker. Solid carbon present in the pelletised granules generate in situ heat for clinker formation at 13 75°C temperature. 30 kg of iron rich clinker is produced from 50 kg of charge material.<br>
The clinker consist of 59.70% AJ2O3 and 25.5% AljOs+FejC^ as major chemical constituent and 52% iron bearing ferrite compounds and 40% tricalcium silicate as the major mineral phase. The clinker is ground to make cements with and without gypsum. The cement prepared without gypsum possesses 45 to 160 minute of setting time, and 420, 560, 710 kg cm respectively the compressive strength (1:3 cement and sand mortar ratio) at 3, 7 and 28 days of curing. The cement prepared with 4% gypsum shows 85 to 210 minute setting time and compressive strength of 430, 576, 750 kg/cm2 respectively of 1:3 cement and sand mortar cube at 3, 7 and 28 days of curing. Effect of gypsum as a set retarder is very negligible on strength development of the cement. Expansion of the cements is within the limit as per Portland cement. This type of high iron cement is suitable for metallurgical and constructional use.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Dry powdery materials of acetylene plant lime, Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) dust [76.80% FezCb, 3.60% SiCh, 2.85% AI2O3, 11.08%CaO, 0.15 T1O2, 0.78% (Na20+K20), clay (50.59% SiCh, 20.82% AI2O3, 14.20% FezCh, 1.65% Ti02) and coke breeze [68% fixed carbon, 29% ash, 3% volatile] are used in different weight percentages to prepare 50 kg raw mixture consisting of 7% solid carbon and 1.48, 0.27, 0.3 as the chemical ratio of CaO/( Al203+Fe203), SiO2/( AhCb+FejCb) and Al203+Fe203 respectively. Granulated pellets of below 15mm sizes of the ground mixture are prepared with 12% water by the disc granulator. 50 kg of the granulated pellets is used to make clinker by the laboratory set up DDS system maintaining 400 mm bed height and applying 250 mm WG air suction pressure to complete the sintering and cooling in 28 minutes.  Coke breezer present in the granulated pellets<br><br>
generates in situ heat and clinker formation has taken place at 1420°C temperature. 34 kg of clinker has been obtained from 50 kg of feed.<br>
The clinker contains 53% CaO and 33% Fe203. Mineralogically the clinker consists of acicular pattern of iron rich ferrite minerals of C6-AF2, C4AJF and crystals of tricalcium silicate (C3S) and dicalcium silicate (C2S) of below 40 micron sizes. Cement prepared from this type of clinker shows 120 to 240 minute setting time and compressive strength of 1:3 cement and mortar at 1, 3, 7, 28 days of curing 180, 430, 610 and 780 kg/cm respectively. The use of gypsum as set retarder in the cement shows less significant effect in respect to setting time and strength. This type of cements is suitable for metallurgical use as well as in building constructions.<br>
Example 3<br>
Calcined lime (88% CaO, 4.50% SiO2, 1.80 MgO), iron ore slime (93% Fe2o3, 1.12% Si02, 2.17% Al2O3), lateritic bauxite (38% Fe203, 41.5% AI2O3, 3.8% SiC&gt;2, 1.8% T1O2), char fines (88% fixed carbon), fluorite and gypsum are mixed in the weight percentage of 48,22, 16, 10.2 and 2 respectively to make 50 kg of raw material mixture. It is then ground in the hall mill to a particle fineness of below 150 mesh (BSS sieve) size. Chemical ratio of CaO (Al203+Fe203) and Al203+Fez03 of the raw material mixture is in the order of 1.42, 0.2 and 0.35 respectively. The powdery mixture is granulated with 15% water to make below 12 mm size granules. Then 50 kg of granulated material is used to make clinker by the down draft sintering (DDS) technique at 1400°Cusing the 460 mm bed height of the material.<br>
The resultant clinker contains 56% CaO and 34% Fe203as the major constituent. Different mineral phases of the clinker are C6AF2, C4AF, calcium silicates (C3S, C2S), CnA7CaF2) calcium sulpho aluminate (C4A3S), calcium sulpho alumino ferrite etc. The clinker exhibits very fine crystalline structure of different mineral phases. Cement prepared with addition of 10% gypsum shows faster setting (less than 60 minutes) and very high compressive strength in the order of 510, 700 kg/cnh in 3, 7 and 28 days of curing. Use of gypsum has got very positive effect inn this type of iron rich cement.<br>
It is inferred that the manufacture of high iron cement clinkers for different applications using various types of raw materials in the present process is quite flexible. Rapid sintering and cooling conditions of the process is a special feature to achieve fine crystalline structure, high temperature solid solutions of ferrite and other mineral phases in the high iron cement clinker and high hydraulic strength of the cement. In addition to the clinker chemistry and mineralogy, the development of high hydraulic, strength of the high iron cement is also related to the cement particle size and content of gypsum as set retarder.<br><br>
The main advantages of the presence invention are:<br>
1	Use of wide varieties of raw materials, industrial and mining solid wastes, fines, etc.<br>
rich in lime and iron, and various types of fluxing materials.<br>
2	Scope for utilization of solid carbon bearing materials like coal, coke, char, waste<br>
fines as main source of fuel. 3.        Flexibility in raw mix design in manufacture of iron rich cements for various uses. 4        High thermal efficiency in clinker formation due to the presence of in situ carbon<br>
within the particle.<br>
5.	Rapid sintering and cooling rate of the sintering system, promotes high degree of solid<br>
solution in iron mineral phases and micro-crystallinity in the clinker to achieve better<br>
cement property.<br>
6.	Minimization of pollution as the sintering system consists of both dry and scrubber<br>
for cleaning of gas and dust.<br>
7	High productivity of the sintering system due to low retention time.<br>
8.        Cost effective as the sintering system is free of refractory materials.<br><br><br>
