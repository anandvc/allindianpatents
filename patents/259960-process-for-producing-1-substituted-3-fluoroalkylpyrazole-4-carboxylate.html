Process	for	Producing<br>
l-Substituted-3-fluoroalkylpyrazole-4-carboxylate Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing l-substituted-3-fluoroalkylpyrazole-4-carboxylate represented by the following general formula (3) , which is useful as  a  synthetic  intermediate  for  Pharmaceuticals  and agrochemicals. [0002]<br>
[Formula 1]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0003]<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, which may be substituted with a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom, R3 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R5 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Background Art [0004]<br>
It  is  known  that  generally,  in  a  reaction  of<br><br>
2-alkoxymethyleneacylacetate and substituted hydrazine, there<br>
are plurality of reaction sites in<br>
2-alkoxymethyleneacylacetate as each reaction substrate, which<br>
causes inferior selectivity of the reaction to form<br>
1,3-disubstituted-pyrazole-4-carboxylate	and<br>
1,5-disubstituted-pyrazole-4-carboxylate which is regioisomer thereof as a by-product. Accordingly, in order to obtain the desired pyrazole derivative, a purification process such as silica gel column chromatography, which is difficult to be industrially performed, is usually required. In JP-A-2000-128763 (patent document 1), it is described that a mixture of 1,3- and 1,5-disubstituted-pyrazole-4--carboxylates obtained as a mixture are is hydrolyzed, followed by crystallization to give the desired 1,3-disubstituted--pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. However, in order to obtain the desired product of high purity, it is necessary to perform crystallization under strict pH control, which industrially causes necessity of complicated operations. [0005]<br>
In JP-A-1-113371 (patent document 2) , there is described<br>
a	production	method	of<br>
1,3-disubstituted-pyrazole-4-carboxylate by a reaction of<br>
2-ethoxymethyleneacylacetate and substituted hydrazine.<br>
However, there is no detailed description for the yield and<br>
selectivity	of<br><br>
l-substituted-3-trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate   in the present invention.<br>
The present inventors have conducted a reaction of ethyl 2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate and methyl-hydrazine by using the method described in patent document 2. As a result, the isomer ratio of ethyl l-methyl-3--trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate and its regioisomer of ethyl l-methyl-5-trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate is 76:24, and it is therefore difficult to say that the procedure is a method having good selectivity (see the following Comparative Example 3).<br>
[0006]<br>
Further, in Example 1 of JP-A-6-199803 (patent document 3) , there is described a method of producing ethyl l-methyl-3--trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate by reacting ethyl-2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate with methylhydrazine in ethanol at a specified temperature . However, it is clearly written that the desired product is obtained as a mixture containing 15% of undesired ethyl -l-methyl-5--trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate. Furthermore, according to the method described in this patent, raw materials are required to be charged at a low temperature of -40 to -35°C, so that this method is industrially lacking in economic efficiency.<br>
[0007]<br><br>
Further, in JP-A-2000-212166 (patent document 4) , there is described a production method of l-substituted-3— trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate using 2-ethoxy-methylene-4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate and substituted hydrazine. It is described that l-substituted-3— trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate is obtained in a yield of about 85% according to this method (Examples 2 to 4). On the other hand, there is no description for the formation of l-substituted-5-trifluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxylate, which is an isomer. However, it is clearly written in the specification that when 2-ethoxymethyleneacylacetate and alkylhydrazine are allowed to react with each other at 10°C, a mixture of the desired 1,3-dialkylpyrazole-4-carboxylate (yield: 80-85%) and its regioisomer 1, 5-dialkylpyrazole-4-carboxylate(yield: 10~15%) is obtained, which causes the necessity of purification by distillation in order to obtain the desiredproduct. Furthermore, in the method of this patent, usable solvents are limited, and it is indispensable to conduct the reaction in esters as a solvent (for example, ethyl acetate or dimethyl carbonate) . Inaddition, in order to obtain the desired product with high yield, it is necessary to conduct the reaction at a low temperature of 5 to 10°C in the beginning of the reaction, and thereafter, at a reflux temperature of the solvent used. Accordingly, it is hard to say to be an industrially advantageous productionmethod.<br><br>
[0008]<br>
Moreover, in the methods described in JP-A-1-113371<br>
(patent document 2), JP-A-6-199803 (patent document 3) and JP-A-2000-212166 (patent document 4) mentioned above, anhydrous hydrazines are used as the raw materials. However, anhydrous hydrazines are highly explosive as is well known, so that it is highly dangerous to use them in large amounts on an industrial scale. Accordingly, when the desired 1,3--disubstituted-pyrazole-4-carboxylate can be highly selectively produced with high yield by using hydrazine hydrate or aqueous solution of hydrazine having low explosive properties, it can conceivably become an extremely excellent method as an industrial production method. However, in all of the above-mentioned patent documents 2 to 4, the influence of water on the yield and selectivity of the desired 1,3--disubstituted-pyrazole-4-carboxylate at the time when water coexists in the reaction system is not described at all. Further, as a result that this reaction has been actually conducted in the presence of water, it has become clear that selectivity substantially decreases. It has therefore been revealed that the desired 1, 3-disubstituted-pyrazole-4-carboxylate is not necessarily obtained in good selectivity only by conducting the reaction in the presence of water (see the following Comparative Examples 1, 5, 6 and 7).<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0022]<br>
The process of the present invention will be described in more detail below.<br>
Some of 2-alkoxymethylenefluoroacylacetate (1) used as a raw material in the process of the present invention is commercially available, but it can be easily produced by usual synthetic methods in organic chemistry. For example, it can<br>
be easily produced by reaction of p-ketocarboxylate, which is obtained by Claisen condensation of fluorine-containing carboxylate and acetate, with orthoformate in the presence of acetic anhydride. [0023]<br>
Here, examples of the substituents represented by R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 in the above-mentioned general formulas (1) to (3) will be shown below. [0024]<br>
A halogen atom represented by R1 is exemplified by a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or the like. [0025]<br>
An alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms represented by R2, which may be substituted with a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom, is exemplified by a trifluoromethyl group, a di-fluoromethyl group, a chlorodifluoromethyl group, a penta-fluoroethyl group, a perfluoropropyl group, a perfluoropentyl group, a 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-decafluoropentyl group, a perf luorohexyl group, a perf luorononyl group, a perf luorodecyl group or a perfluorododecyl group or the like. [0026]<br>
An alkyl groups having 1 to 6 alkyl groups represented by R3 and R4 of general formula (1) include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a butyl group, isobutyl group, a pentyl group or a hexyl group and the like. [0027]<br>
Further, as an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms represented by R5 shown in general formula (2), which may be substituted, there can be exemplified a methyl group, an ethyl group,a propylgroup,acyclopropylmethylgroup,abutylgroup, an isobutyl group, a pentyl group or a hexyl group or the like. Furthermore, these alkyl groups may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms or the like, and specifically, examples thereof include a 2-chloroethyl group, a 2-bromoethyl group, a 2-hydroxyethyl group, a 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl group or a 3-chloropropyl group and the like. [0028]<br>
Hydrazines used as a raw material in the present process are partially easily available, and can be easily produced by conventional methods. Further, these hydrazines can be used in any form of an anhydride, a hydrate and an aqueous solution. [0029]<br>
In the process of the present invention, it is indispensable to conduct the reaction in the presence of a base and water.<br>
As the base, there can be used alkali metal hydroxides<br>
such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, alkali earth metal hydroxides such as calcium hydroxide,  or  organic  amines  such  as  triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine or pyridine.  Sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide is preferred among others in terms of the good yield and selectivity of the desired product and its cheapness. [0030]<br>
There is no particular limitation of the base on the amount thereof used and the concentration of an aqueous solution thereof. It is used in an amount of 0.001 to 10.0 equivalents, and preferably in an amount of 0.05 to 5.0 equivalents, based on the above-mentioned 2-alkoxymethylenefluoroacylacetate (1), thereby being able to obtain the desired product with the good yield and selectivity. [0031]<br>
Further, although there is no particular limitation on the amount of water used, it is preferred to conduct the reaction, under control of the amount of water added, because a hydrolysis reaction occurs in ester units of the rawmaterial or the product, depending on the reaction conditions, when the reaction is conducted in an aqueous solution of inorganic base. As for the amount of water used, the weight ratio of 2-alkoxymethylenef luoroacylacetate (1) and water is preferably from 1/0.25 to 1/100, and desirably from 1/1 to 1/50, in terms of the good yield and selectivity.<br><br>
[0032]<br>
Further, in the process of the present invention, the reaction can also be conducted under the coexistence of an organic solvent. As the organic solvent, there can be exemplified aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane or octane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or 1,2-dichloroethane, esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate or dimethyl carbonate, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol or tert-butyl alcohol, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, 1,2-di-methoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane, or the like. Preferred are aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols and halogenated hydrocarbons. There is no particular limitation on the amount of the organic solvent used.<br>
[0033]<br>
Further, the reaction is conducted at a reaction temperature appropriately selected from -30 to 80°C, preferably from -20 to 60°C, thereby being able to obtain the desired product with the good yield and selectivity. However, in the reaction in water solvent, it is preferred to conduct the reaction at a temperature at which water is not solidified or higher. Examples<br><br>
[0034]<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in greater detail with reference to the following examples and comparative examples, but the invention should not be construed as being limited thereto.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
[0036]<br>
A 35% by weight aqueous solution of methylhydrazine (0 .197 mL, 1.5 mmol) was added to a solution of potassium hydroxide<br>
(28mg, O.Smmol) inwater (5.0mL)with stirring.  To the solution, ethyl 2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate (0.097 mL, 120 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added dropwise under ice-cooling, followed by stirring for 1 hour at ambient temperature.

To the solution, ethyl 2-ethoxymethylenetrifluoroacetoacetate (1.0 g, 4.16 mmol) was added dropwise under ice-cooling, taking about 25 minutes, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 10 minutes. To the reaction mixture, 1N hydrochloric acid (20 mL) was added, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate (30<br>
mL x 3) . The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (30 mL) , and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the desiccant was separated by filtration, the solvent was removed from the filtrate by distillation under reduced pressure, thereby obtaining a mixture composed of ethyl l-methyl-3-trifluoro-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate and ethyl l-methyl-5-trifluoro-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate approximately quantitatively. GC analysis revealed that the ratio of the former and the latter was 91:9. [0040]<br>
