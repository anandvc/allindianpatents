LOW SHRINK TELECOMMUNICATIONS CABLE AND METHODS FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to low shrink<br>
telecommunications cable and to methods for manufacturing low shrink<br>
telecommunications cable.<br>
Background<br>
A fiber optic cable typically includes: (1) a fiber or fibers; (2) a buffer<br>
or buffers that surrounds the fiber or fibers; (3) a strength layer that surrounds the<br>
buffer or buffers; and (4) an outer jacket. Optical fibers function to carry optical<br>
signals. A typical optical fiber includes an inner core surrounded by a cladding that<br>
is covered by a coating. Buffers typically function to surround and protect coated<br>
optical fibers. Strength layers add mechanical strength to fiber optic cables to<br>
protect the internal optical fibers against stresses applied to the cables during<br>
installation and thereafter. Example strength layers include aramid yam, steel and<br>
epoxy reinforced glass roving. Outer jackets provide protection against damage<br>
caused by crushing, abrasions, and other physical damage. Outer jackets also<br>
provide protection against chemical damage (e.g., ozone, alkali, acids).<br>
It is well known that micro-bending of an optical fiber within a cable<br>
will negatively affect optical performance. Shrinkage of the outer jacket of a fiber<br>
optic cable can cause axial stress to be applied to the optical fiber, which causes<br>
micro-bending of the optical fiber. One cause of jacket shrinkage is thermal<br>
contraction caused by decreases in temperature. Another source of shrinkage is<br>
post-extrusion shrinkage.<br>
Shrinkage caused by thermal contraction is typically only temporary.<br>
The amount of thermal expansion/contraction is dependent upon the coefficients of<br>
thermal expansion of the materials involved. In a typical fiber optic cable, the jacket<br>
has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than the fiber. Thus, when the<br>
temperature drops due to normal environmental temperature cycling, the jacket may<br>
shrink more than the fiber causing stresses to be applied to the fiber. These stresses<br>
are typically only temporary since the jacket will expand back to its original size<br>
when the temperature returns to normal.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
Post-extrusion shrinkage is a by-product of the extrusion process<br>
used to manufacture fiber optic cables. Generally, to make a fiber optic cable, an<br>
optical fiber is passed through an extrusion die and molten plastic material is<br>
extruded about the exterior of the fiber. As the molten plastic exits the extrusion die,<br>
the plastic is elongated in the direction of flow and then passed through a cooling<br>
bath where the elongated shape of the plastic is set. However, after the shape has<br>
been set, the plastic material continues to have "memory" of the pre-elongated<br>
shape. Thus, if the cable is later heated, the plastic material will gravitate towards<br>
its pre-elongated shape thereby causing post-extrusion axial shrinkage of the cable<br>
jacket. As indicated above, cable jacket shrinkage can cause micro-bending of the<br>
optical fiber thereby degrading signal quality. Unlike shrinkage caused by thermal<br>
contraction, post-extrusion shrinkage of the type described above is permanent.<br>
Post-extrusion shrinkage is a significant problem in the area of<br>
optical fiber connectorization. When a connector is mounted to the end of a fiber<br>
optic cable, a heat cure epoxy is often used to secure the connector to the jacket and<br>
strength layer. When the epoxy is heated during the cure cycle, the cable jacket is<br>
also heated thereby causing permanent post-extrusion shrinkage. Post-extrusion<br>
shrinkage can also be caused after installation by environmental temperature<br>
variations.<br>
Summary<br>
One aspect of the present disclosure relates to a telecommunications<br>
cable having a layer adapted to resist post-extrusion shrinkage. In one embodiment,<br>
the layer is an outer jacket of the cable.<br>
Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to a method for<br>
making a telecommunications cable having a layer adapted to resist post-extrusion<br>
shrinkage.<br>
A variety of other aspects are set forth in the description that follows.<br>
The aspects relate to individual features as well as to combinations of features. It is<br>
to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>
detailed descriptions are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of<br>
the invention as claimed.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to telecommunications cable<br>
layers (e.g., jackets, buffers, sheaths, etc.) constructed to resist post-extrusion<br>
shrinkage while maintaining flexibility. In one embodiment, the layer comprises a<br>
jacket surrounding one or more tight buffered optical fibers. In another<br>
embodiment, the layer can comprise an outer jacket that surrounds a copper cable.<br>
In still another embodiment, the layer can comprise a buffer tube for a loose-<br>
buffered cable. In still another embodiment, the layer comprises a tight buffer layer<br>
surrounding one or more optical fibers. While example applications have been listed<br>
above, it will be appreciated that layers in accordance with the principles of the<br>
present disclosure can be used for any layer of a telecommunications cable where<br>
reduced shrinkage and relatively high levels of flexibility are desirable.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a fiber optic cable 20 that may incorporate one or<br>
more shrinkage resistant layers in accordance with the principles of the present<br>
disclosure. The fiber optic cable 20 includes an optical fiber 22, a buffer 24, a<br>
strength layer 26 and an outer jacket 28. The outer jacket 28 and/or the buffer 24<br>
may have a construction adapted to resist post-extrusion shrinkage.<br>
It will be appreciated that the optical fiber 22 can have any number of<br>
conventional configurations. For example, the optical fiber 22 may include a silica-<br>
based core suiTOunded by a silica-based cladding having a lower index of refraction<br>
than the core. One or more protective polymeric coatings may surround the<br>
cladding. The optical fiber 22 may be a single-mode fiber or a multi-mode fiber.<br>
Example optical fibers are commercially available from Corning Inc. of Coming,<br>
New York.<br>
The buffer 24 is depicted as a tight buffer layer that surrounds the<br>
fiber 22. It will be appreciated that the buffer 24 can have any number of<br>
conventionally known constructions. For example, the buffer 24 can be made of a<br>
polymeric material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Other polymeric materials<br>
(e.g., polyethylenes, polyurethanes, polypropylenes, polyvinylidene fluorides,<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate, nylon, polyester, or other materials) may also be used. In<br>
certain embodiments, the buffer layer may have a construction adapted to resist post-<br>
extrusion shrinkage. For example, similar to the outer jacket 28 described below,<br>
the buffer can include shrinkage reduction members embedded therein to resist axial<br>
shrinkage.<br>
The strength layer 26 is adapted to inhibit axial tensile loading from<br>
being applied to the optical fiber 22. The strength layer 26 preferably extends the<br>
entire length of the fiber optic cable. In certain embodiments, the strength layer can<br>
include yarns, fibers, threads, tapes, films, epoxies, filaments or other structures. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the strength layer 26 includes aramid yarns (e.g., Kevlar®<br>
yarns) that extend lengthwise along the entire length of the cable. As depicted in<br>
Figure 1, the strength layer 26 is provided generally at the interface between the<br>
buffer 24 and the jacket 28.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the jacket 28 has a structure adapted to resist<br>
post-extrusion shrinkage. For example, the jacket 28 includes a base material 30 and<br>
a plurality of discrete shrinkage-reduction members 32 (e.g., rods, tendrils,<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
extensions, fibers, etc.) embedded within the base material 30. The shrinkage-<br>
reduction members 32 are preferably constructed of a material that has better post-<br>
extrusion shrink characteristics than the base material 30. As described in the<br>
background, when the base material is stretched, the base material retains a memory<br>
of the pre-stretched shape and will gravitate towards the pre-stretched shape when<br>
reheated. The shrinkage-reduction members preferably demonstrate less shrinkage<br>
than the base material when reheated. Because the shrinkage-reduction members are<br>
embedded in the base material, the shrinkage-reduction members provide<br>
reinforcement that resists shrinkage of the base material. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the shrinkage reduction material has a melting temperature that is<br>
greater than the melting temperature of the base material.<br>
Referring still to Figure 2, the shrinkage-reduction members 32 are<br>
preferably elongated and have lengths that are aligned generally parallel to a<br>
longitudinal axis L-A of the cable 20. Each of the shrinkage reduction members 32<br>
preferably does not extend the entire length of the cable 20. Instead, each of the<br>
members 32 preferably coincides with or extends along only a relatively short<br>
segment of the total length of the cable. For example, in one embodiment, at least<br>
some of the members 32 have lengths in the range of .2 mm - 100 mm. In another<br>
embodiment, at least some of the members 32 have lengths in the range of 5 - 60<br>
mm. In still another embodiment, at least some of the members have lengths in the<br>
range of about 10-40 mm. In certain embodiments, a majority of the shrinkage<br>
reduction members provided within the base material can be within the size ranges<br>
provided above, or within other size ranges. Additionally, most of the members 32<br>
are preferably discrete or separate from one another. For example, many of the<br>
members 32 are preferably separated or isolated from one another by portions of the<br>
base material 30.<br>
To further promote flexibility, the concentration of the shrink-<br>
reduction members is relatively small as compared to the base material. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, the shrink-reduction material constitutes less than 2%<br>
of the total weight of the jacket 28. In another embodiment, the shrink-reduction<br>
material constitutes less than 1.5% of the total weight of the jacket 28. In still<br>
another embodiment, the shrink-reduction material constitutes less than or equal to<br>
1.25% of the total weight of the jacket 28. In a further embodiment, the shrink-<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
reduction material constitutes less than or equal to 1.0% of the total weight of the<br>
jacket 28. While preferred embodiments use less than 2% of the shrink-reduction<br>
material by weight, other embodiments within the scope of the present invention can<br>
use more than 2% by weight of the shrink-reduction material.<br>
In one embodiment, the base material is a polymer such as a flexible<br>
chain polymer (i.e., one in which successive units of the polymer chain are free to<br>
rotate with respect to one another, so that the polymer chain can assume a random<br>
shape). Example base materials include conventional thermoplastic polymers such<br>
as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene, copolymers, polystyrene, and<br>
styrene copolymers, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide (nylon), polyesters such as<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, polyetheretherketone, polyphenylene sulfide,<br>
polyetherimide, polybutylene terephthalate, low smoke zero halogens polyolefins<br>
and polycarbonate, as well as other thermoplastic materials. Additives may also be<br>
added to the base material. Example additives include pigments, fillers, coupling<br>
agents, flame retardants, lubricants, plasticizers, ultraviolet stabilizers or other<br>
additives. The base material can also include combinations of the above materials as<br>
well as combinations of other materials.<br>
In one embodiment, the shrinkage-reduction members are made from<br>
a material that can be softened and reshaped in the extrusion process. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the shrinkage-reduction members include liquid crystal polymers.<br>
Example liquid crystal polymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,991,014;<br>
4,067,852; 4,083,829; 4,130,545; 4,161,470; 4,318,842; and 4,468,364, which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Liquid crystal polymers are<br>
polymers that are anisotropic and highly oriented, even in a softened or liquid phase.<br>
In one embodiment, the jacket 28 shrinks less than 3% in length<br>
when exposed to 110 degrees Celsius for 2 hours in accordance with standard<br>
Telcordia test procedures set forth at GR 409 (Generic Reference 409 developed by<br>
Telcordia). In another embodiment, the jacket 28 shrinks less than 2% in length, or<br>
less than 1% in length, when subjected to the same test. The amount of shrinkage is<br>
directly dependent on the amount of liquid crystal polymer used. Typically, when<br>
2% liquid crystal polymer by weight is used, the jacket length shrinks less than 1 %<br>
on average. The above data is based on tests performed on jackets alone with the<br>
fibers and strength members removed prior to shrink-testing.<br>

Figure 3 shows a two-fiber zipcord cable 220 having two optical<br>
fibers 222, two buffers 224, two aramid strength layers 226, and an outer jacket 228.<br>
The outer jacket 228 preferably has a shrink-resistant construction of the type<br>
described with respect to the jacket 28 of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows a distribution cable 320 having a central strength<br>
member 321, a plurality of optical fibers 322, buffers 324 surrounding each of the<br>
optical fibers, a tensile strength member 326, and an outer jacket 328. The outer<br>
jacket 328 preferably has a shrink-resistant construction of the type described with<br>
respect to the jacket 28 of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 5 shows a loose buffered cable 420 having a central strength<br>
member 421, bundles of unbuffered optical fibers 422 contained within buffer tubes<br>
424, a tensile strength layer 426, an inner sheath 427, an optional armor layer 429,<br>
and an outer optional sheath 431. Tensile strength layers 423 are also shown<br>
between the fibers 422 and the buffer tubes 424. The fibers 422 are arranged around<br>
central strength members 433 positioned within the buffer tubes 424. The buffer<br>
tubes 424 have a shrink-resistant construction of the type described with respect to<br>
thejacket28ofFigure2<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a system 100 for making the fiber optic cable 20<br>
of Figure 1. The system 100 includes a crosshead 102 that receives thermoplastic<br>
material from an extruder 104. A hopper 106 is used to feed materials into the<br>
extruder 104. A first conveyor 108 conveys the base material to the hopper 106. A<br>
second conveyor 110 conveys the shrinkage-reduction material to the hopper 106.<br>
The extruder 104 is heated by a heating system 112 that may include one or more<br>
heating elements for heating zones of the extruder as well as the crosshead to desired<br>
processing temperatures. Buffered optical fiber is fed into the crosshead 102 from a<br>
feed roll 114 (see Figure 6A). Strength members are fed into the crosshead from<br>
one or more feed rolls 116 (see Figure 6A). A water trough 118 is located<br>
downstream from the crosshead 102 for cooling the extruded product (see Figure<br>
6B) that exits the crosshead 102. The cooled final product is stored on a take-up roll<br>
120 rotated by a drive mechanism 122. A controller 124 coordinates the operation<br>
of the various components of the system 100.<br>
In use of the system 100, the base material and the shrinkage-<br>
reduction material are delivered to the hopper 106 by the first and second conveyors<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
108, 110, respectively. In certain embodiments, the base material and the shrinkage-<br>
reduction material can be delivered to the hopper 106 in pellet form, and the<br>
conveyors 108, 110 can include conveyor belts or screw augers. The controller 124<br>
preferably controls the proportions of the base material and the shrinkage-reduction<br>
material delivered to the hopper 106. In one embodiment, the shrinkage-reduction<br>
material constitutes less than 2% by weight of the total material delivered to the<br>
hopper 106. In other embodiments, the shrinkage reduction material constitutes less<br>
than 1.5% of the total weight of material delivered to the hopper 106, In still other<br>
embodiments, the shrinkage reduction material constitutes less than or equal to 1 %<br>
of the total weight of material delivered to the hopper 106.<br>
From the hopper 106, the material moves by gravity into the extruder<br>
104. In the extruder 104, the material is mixed, masticated, and heated. In one<br>
embodiment, the material is heated to a temperature greater than the melting<br>
temperature of the base material, but less than the melting temperature of the<br>
shrinkage reduction material. The temperature is preferably sufficiently high to<br>
soften the shrinkage-reduction material such that the shrinkage-reduction material is<br>
workable and extmdable. The extruder 104 is heated by the heating system 112.<br>
The extruder 104 also functions to convey the material to the crosshead 102, and to<br>
provide pressure for forcing the material through the crosshead 102.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the extruder 104 is depicted as including an<br>
extruder barrel 140 and an auger/style extruder screw 142 positioned within the<br>
barrel 140. An extruder screen 144 can be provided at the exit end of the extruder<br>
104. The screen 144 prevents pieces too large for extrusion from passing from the<br>
extruder into the crosshead 102.<br>
Referring still to Figure 7, the crosshead 102 includes a jacket<br>
material input location 200 that receives thermoplastic material from the extruder<br>
104. The crosshead 102 also includes a tip 202 and a die 204. The tip 202 defines<br>
an inner passageway 206 through which the buffered optical fiber and the strength<br>
members are fed. The die 204 defines an annular extrusion passage 208 that<br>
surrounds the exterior of the tip 202. The crosshead 102 defines an annular<br>
passageway for feeding the thermoplastic jacket material to the annular extrusion<br>
passage 208. Within the crosshead, the flow direction of the thermoplastic material<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
turns 90 degrees relative to the flow direction of the extruder 104 to align with the<br>
buffered fiber.<br>
Within the crosshead 102, the material provided by the extruder 104<br>
is preferably maintained at a temperature greater than the melt temperature of the<br>
base material, but less than the melt temperature of the shrinkage reduction material.<br>
As the thermoplastic material is extruded through the annular extrusion passage 208,<br>
the base material and the shrinkage-reduction material are stretched. This stretching<br>
causes reshaping of the shrinkage-reduction material into elongated shrinkage-<br>
reduction members having lengths aligned generally along the longitudinal axis of<br>
the fiber optic cable. The extruded fiber optic cable is then cooled and shape set at<br>
the water trough 118. The extrusion process can be a pressure or semi-pressure<br>
extrusion process where product leaves the crosshead at the desired shape, or an<br>
annular extrusion process where the product is drawn down after extrusion. After<br>
cooling, the product is collected on the take-up roller 120.<br>
Examples<br>
This invention will now be further described in detail with reference<br>
to a specific example. It will be understood that this example provides one<br>
embodiment of the invention and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
One experimental example used Dow 1638 low smoke zero halogen<br>
material as a base material mixed with a liquid crystal polymer such as Ticona<br>
Vectra A950. The base material has a melt temperature of 362°F, and the liquid<br>
crystal polymer has a melt temperature of 536°F and a softening temperature of<br>
293 °F. The materials were mixed at a ratio of 99% base material and 1% of the<br>
liquid crystal polymer. The materials were masticated within a screw extruder and<br>
heated to a temperature of 452°F. The materials were then forced through a<br>
crosshead including a tip having an outside diameter of .062", and a die defining an<br>
extrusion opening having an inside diameter of .130". The crosshead was heated to<br>
a temperature of 500°F. The run speed was 12 meters per minute. The extruded<br>
jacket had an exterior diameter of .0787" (2.0 mm) and an interior diameter of .061"<br>
(1.54 mm). The jacket was extruded without an inner optical core. After cooling,<br>
the jacket was cut into 150 mm segments and heated to 110 degrees Celsius for 2<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/093573	PCT/US2006/001109<br>
hours to test for shrinkage. The testing showed that the jacket segments shrunk less<br>
than 2% in length on average based on GR 409 shrink testing.<br>
Another experimental example used Dow 1638 low smoke zero<br>
halogen material as a base material mixed with a liquid crystal polymer such as<br>
Ticona Vectra A950. The base material has a melt temperature of 362°F, and the<br>
liquid crystal polymer has a melt temperature of 536°F and a softening temperature<br>
of 293°F. The materials were mixed at a ratio of 98% base material and 2% of the<br>
liquid crystal polymer. The materials were masticated within a screw extruder and<br>
heated to a temperature of 475°F. The materials were then forced through a<br>
crosshead including a tip having an outside diameter of .064", and a die defining an<br>
extrusion opening having an inside diameter of .127". The ci'osshead was heated to<br>
a temperature of 500°F. The run speed was a high speed run of 143 meters per<br>
minute. The extruded jacket had an exterior diameter of .0787" (2.0 mm) and an<br>
interior diameter of .0508" (1.29 mm). The jacket was extruded about an internal<br>
optical core. After cooling, the jacket was cut into 150 mm segments and heated to<br>
110 degrees Celsius for 2 hours to test for shrinkage. The testing showed that the<br>
jacket segments shrunk less than 1% in length on average based on GR 409 shrink<br>
testing. The core was removed for the shrink testing.<br>
