0264P4-US), filed October 30,2003. These applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzofuran derivatives and analogs, as well as compositions containing the same and to the use thereof for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections and diseases associated therewith, particularly those viral infections and associated diseases caused by the hepatitis C virus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis C is a common infection that can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) leads to chronic hepatitis in at least 85% of cases. It is the leading reason for liver transplantation, and is responsible for at least 10,000 deaths annually in the United States (Hepatology, 1997,26 (Suppl. 1), 2S-10S).<br>
Interferon and interferon in combination with ribavirin are used in the U.S. for hepatitis due to HCV. These treatments are associated with improved serum enzyme response in some patients. The remainder are non-responsive to treatment. For responders, a sustained clinical improvement is seen in only a small percentage of patients; the majority of patients relapse upon cessation of treatment. Thus, the effectiveness of therapy for chronic hepatitis C is variable and its cure rate remains low. Moreover, therapy is often associated with considerable side effects.<br><br>
New therapies and preventatives are clearly needed for infections and diseases caused by the hepatitis C virus.<br>
The hepatitis C virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family. The genome of HCV is positive strand, single stranded linear RNA (Hepatology, 1997,26 (Suppl. 1), 11S-14S). HCV displays extensive genetic heterogeneity; at least six genotypes and more than 50 subtypes have been identified.<br>
Following infection by HCV, the viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein. This approximately 3,000 residue polyprotein is subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by host peptidases, as well as virally encoded proteases. The HCV genome encodes structural proteins (required for virus assembly) and nonstructural proteins (required for replication). Some of the nonstructural proteins include: NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (J. General Virology, 2000, 81,1631-1648). NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for viral replication. In positive stranded RNA viruses, such as HCV, RNA is the sole genetic material. Since mammalian host cells ordinarily lack RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, the positive stranded RNA viruses encode their own replicative polymerase (NS5B in the case of HCV), which is essential for the production of virion progeny. The inhibition of NS5B activity, therefore, provides an attractive target for HCV drug design.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one aspect, the present invention provides compounds and compositions for the treatment and prophylaxis of viral infections, as well as diseases associated with viral infections in living hosts. The compounds of the invention are of the following general formula:<br>

The antiviral pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise one or more of the compounds) of Formula I above, as the active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier medium or auxiliary agent<br>
The composition may be prepared in various forms for administration, including tablets, caplets, pills or dragees, or can be filled in suitable containers, such as capsules, or, in the case of suspensions, filled into bottles. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier medium" includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Twentieth Edition, A. R. Gennaro (William and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 2000) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the antiviral compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, the active agent may be present in an amount of at least 0.5% and generally not more than 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, including carrier medium and/or auxiliary agent(s), if any. Preferably, the proportion of active agent varies between 5 to 50% by weight of the composition.<br>
Pharmaceutical organic or inorganic solid or liquid carrier media suitable for enteral or parenteral administration can be used to make up the composition. Gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable and animal fats and oils, gum, polyalkylene glycol, or other known medicament components may all be suitable as carrier media or excipients.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for attenuating infectivity of the virus. Thus, the expression "amount effective to attenuate infectivity of virus," as used herein, refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the antiviral agent to provide the desired prophylaxis and/or treatment of viral infection. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the<br><br>
species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular antiviral agent, its mode of administration, and the like.<br>
The antiviral compounds are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. 'Dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of antiviral agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. Each dosage should contain the quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either as such, or in association with the selected pharmaceutical carrier medium and/or the supplemental active agent(s), if any. Typically, the antiviral compounds of the invention will be administered in dosage units containing from about 2 mg to about 7000 mg of the antiviral agent by weight of the composition, with a range of about 10 mg to about 2000 mg being preferred.<br>
The compounds may be administered orally, rectally, parenterally, such as by intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intravenous infusion or the like, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, locally, such as by powders, ointments, or drops, or the like, or by inhalation, such as by aerosol or the like, taking into account the nature and severity of the infection being treated. Depending on the route of administration, the compounds of the invention may be administered at dosage levels of about 0.05 to about 100 mg/kg of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
The compounds of the invention will typically be administered from 1 to 4 times a day so as to deliver the above-mentioned daily dosage. However, the exact regimen for administration of the compounds and compositions described herein will necessarily be dependent on the needs of the individual host or patient being treated, the type of treatment administered and the judgment of the attending medical specialist.<br>
In view of the inhibitory effect on viral RNA synthesis produced by the compounds of the invention, it is anticipated that these compounds will be useful not only for therapeutic treatment of virus infection, but for virus infection prophylaxis, as well. The dosages may be essentially the same, whether for treatment or prophylaxis of virus infection.<br>

Example 464 Inhibition of Viral RNA Replication<br>
Antiviral activity of representative compounds of the invention was first evaluated in a human liver-derived cell line (Huh-7-Clone A) containing the HCV replicon (BB7 sequence) (See Lohmann et al. Science.1999,285:110-3; Blight KJ et al., Science. 2000,290:1972-4; Pietschmann, T. et al., /. Virol. 2001,73:1252-1264; and Lohmann, V. et al., /. Virol. 2001, 75:1437-1449). The HCV replicon is a subgenomic viral RNA that expresses the HCV proteins required for its own replication. These proteins include non-structural proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The replicon also contains a foreign gene encoding a drug-selectable marker (neomycin phosphotransferase) to allow for G418 (neomycin) selection of cells that contain the replicon.<br>
An ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) was used to determine the effect of compounds within the scope of the invention on the amount of HCV NS5A protein produced after a 72-hour incubation of the replicon-containing cells in the presence of varying<br>
concentrations of compound. COSTAR® 96-well cell culture plates were used but other known cell culture plates may be used. After incubation, media is removed from wells and the cells are fixed to the assay pla'teusihg" 0.0"5% gluTara'ldehyde. Th¥ glutaratdefiydeTs then washed off" using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) following a 1 hour incubation and cells are blocked for non-specific antibody binding using for example SUPERBLOCK® reagent (blocking buffer) in PBS. The blocking agent is rinsed from the cells with PBS after 1 hour at 37°C and primary monoclonal antibody is added to each well containing compound. Primary antibody is incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and rinsed 3 times with PBS containing 0.02% TWEEN-20™ before addition of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody. HRP is incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and rinsed several times, first with PBS/TWEEN-20™ followed by PBS alone. To quantify peroxidase activity, 3,3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added to the plate and after 30 minutes, the plates are read in an ELIS A plate reader at an OD of 650nm. Compound dose response was measured in an 8-point dose curve diluted serially to determine the inhibitory concentration at 50% (ECso value). Representative compounds of the invention showed a dose-dependent inhibition of intracellular NS5A levels. Ranges of 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) for representative compounds within the scope of this invention are listed in Table 1. Preferred compounds have 50% effective concentrations at about 30 uM or less, more preferred compounds have 50% effective concentrations at about 5 uM or less, and most preferred compounds have 50% effective concentrations at about 0.5 uM or less.<br>
Example 465 Inhibition of Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)<br>
The HCV NS5B-directed RdRp activity was established and characterized in a standard m vitro biochemical assay using a purified HCV NS5B protein derived from the consensus sequence of a patient infected with HCV genotype Ib virus (BB7). (See Blight KJ et al., Science. 2000, 290:1972-4). The NS5B consensus sequence was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a histidine tagged (GSHHHHHH) fusion protein, of which the carboxyl terminal 21 amino acids were removed to enhance its solubility.<br>
In addition to evaluating their activity in the replicon assay, representative compounds within the scope of the present invention, as shown in examples 1-453 of Table 1, were also evaluated for antiviral activity using this assay. A measure of the inhibitory activity of compounds of the invention may be expressed as IC50 values. ICso values represent the concentration of the compound at which 50% of the RdRp activity is inhibited. The results of the assay for inhibition of RdRp activity of HCV, NS5B proteins for a substantial majority of the compounds tested revealed ICso values ranging from
