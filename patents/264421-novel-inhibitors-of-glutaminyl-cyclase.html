				<td>Novel Inhibitors of Glutaminyl Cyclase<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5) that catalyzes the intramolecular<br>
cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (5-oxo-prolyl, pGlu*) under<br>
liberation of ammonia and the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamate residues into<br>
pyroglutamic acid under liberation of water.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal<br>
glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) liberating ammonia. A QC was first isolated by<br>
Messer from the latex of the tropical plant Carica papaya in 1963 (Messer, M. 1963 Nature<br>
4874, 1299). 24 years later, a corresponding enzymatic activity was discovered in animal<br>
pituitary (Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262, 8532-8536; Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J.<br>
1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 84, 3628-3632). For the mammalian QC, the conversion of Gin<br>
into pGlu by QC could be shown for the precursors of TRH and GnRH (Busby, W. H. J. et al.<br>
1987 J Biol Chem 262, 8532-8536; Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S<br>
A 84, 3628-3632). In addition, initial localization experiments of QC revealed a co-localization<br>
with its putative products of catalysis in bovine pituitary, further improving the suggested<br>
function in peptide hormone synthesis (Bockers, T. M. et al. 1995 J Neuroendocrinol 7, 445-<br>
453). In contrast, the physiological function of the plant QC is less clear. In the case of the<br>
enzyme from C. papaya, a role in the plant defense against pathogenic microorganisms was<br>
suggested (El Moussaoui, A. et al.2001 Cell Mol Life Sci 58, 556-570). Putative QCs from other<br>
plants were identified by sequence comparisons recently (Dahl, S. W. et al.2000 Protein Expr<br>
Purif 20, 27-36). The physiological function of these enzymes, however, is still ambiguous.<br>
The QCs known from plants and animals show a strict specificity for L-Glutamine in the N-<br>
terminal position of the substrates and their kinetic behavior was found to obey the Michaelis-<br>
Menten equation (Pohl, T. et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 88, 10059-10063; Consalvo, A.<br>
P. et al. 1988 Anal Biochem 175, 131-138; Gololobov, M. Y. et al. 1996 Biol Chem Hoppe<br>
Seyler 377, 395-398). A comparison of the primary structures of the QCs from C. papaya and<br>
that of the highly conserved QC from mammals, however, did not reveal any sequence<br>
homology (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36). Whereas the plant QCs appear<br>
to belong to a new enzyme family (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36), the<br>
mammalian QCs were found to have a pronounced sequence homology to bacterial<br>
aminopeptidases (Bateman, R. C. et al. 2001 Biochemistry 40, 11246-11250), leading to the<br>
conclusion that the QCs from plants and animals have different evolutionary origins.<br><br><br><br>
Recently, it was shown that recombinant human QC as well as QC-activity from brain extracts<br>
catalyze both, the N-terminal glutaminyl as well as glutamate cyclization. Most striking is the<br>
finding, that cyclase-catalyzed GlU1-conversion is favored around pH 6.0 while Gln1-conversion<br>
to pGlu-derivatives occurs with a pH-optimum of around 8.0. Since the formation of pGlu-Aβ<br>
related peptides can be suppressed by inhibition of recombinant human QC and QC-activity<br>
from pig pituitary extracts, the enzyme QC is a target in drug development for treatment of<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
First inhibitors of QC are described in WO 2004/098625, WO 2004/098591, WO 2005/039548<br>
and WO 2005/075436.<br>
EP 02 011 349.4 discloses polynucleotides encoding insect glutaminyl cyclase, as well as<br>
polypeptides encoded thereby and their use in methods of screening for agents that reduce<br>
glutaminyl cyclase activity. Such agents are useful as pesticides.<br>
Definitions<br>
The terms "Ki" or "Ki" and "KD" are binding constants, which describe the binding of an inhibitor<br>
to and the subsequent release from an enzyme. Another measure is the "IC50" value, which<br>
reflects the inhibitor concentration, which at a given substrate concentration results in 50 %<br>
enzyme activity.<br>
The term "DP IV-inhibitor" or "dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor" is generally known to a person<br>
skilled in the art and means enzyme inhibitors, which inhibit the catalytic activity of DP IV or DP<br>
IV-like enzymes.<br>
"DP IV-activity" is defined as the catalytic activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) and DP IV-<br>
like enzymes. These enzymes are post-proline (to a lesser extent post-alanine, post-serine or<br>
post-glycine) cleaving serine proteases found in various tissues of the body of a mammal<br>
including kidney, liver, and intestine, where they remove dipeptides from the N-terminus of<br>
biologically active peptides with a high specificity when proline or alanine form the residues that<br>
are adjacent to the N-terminal amino acid in their sequence.<br>
The term "PEP-inhibitor" or "prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor" is generally known to a person<br>
skilled in the art and means enzyme inhibitors, which inhibit the catalytic activity of prolyl<br>
endopeptidase (PEP, prolyl oligopeptidase, POP).<br><br><br><br>
"PEP-activity" is defined as the catalytic activity of an endoprotease that is capable to hydrolyze<br>
post proline bonds in peptides or proteins were the proline is in amino acid position 3 or higher<br>
counted from the N-terminus of a peptide or protein substrate.<br>
The term "QC" as used herein comprises glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and QC-like enzymes. QC<br>
and QC-like enzymes have identical or similar enzymatic activity, further defined as QC activity.<br>
In this regard, QC-like enzymes can fundamentally differ in their molecular structure from QC.<br>
Examples of QC-like enzymes are the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like proteins<br>
(QPCTLs) from human (GenBank NM_017659), mouse (GenBank BC058181), Macaca<br>
fascicularis (GenBank AB168255), Macaca mulatta (GenBank XM_001110995), Canis familiaris<br>
(GenBank XM_541552), Rattus norvegicus (GenBank XM_001066591), Mus musculus<br>
(GenBank BC058181) and Bos taurus (GenBank BT026254).<br>
The term "QC activity" as used herein is defined as intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal<br>
glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) or of N-terminal L-homoglutamine or L-β-<br>
homoglutamine to a cyclic pyro-homoglutamine derivative under liberation of ammonia. See<br>
therefore schemes 1 and 2.<br>
Scheme 1: Cyclization of glutamine by QC<br><br><br><br><br>
The term "EC" as used herein comprises the activity of QC and QC-like enzymes as glutamate<br>
cyclase (EC), further defined as EC activity.<br>
The term "EC activity" as used herein is defined as intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamate residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) by QC. See therefore scheme 3.<br>
Scheme 3: N-terminal cyclization of uncharged glutamyl peptides by QC (EC)<br><br>
 The term "QC-inhibitor" "glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor" is generally known to a person skilled in<br>
the art and means enzyme inhibitors, which inhibit the catalytic activity of glutaminyl cyclase<br>
(QC) or its glutamyl cyclase (EC) activity.<br>
Potency of QC inhibition<br>
 In light of the correlation with QC inhibition, in preferred embodiments, the subject method and<br>
medical use utilize an agent with an IC5o for QC inhibition of 10 uM or less, more preferably of 1<br>
μM or less, even more preferably of 0.1 uM or less or 0.01 uM or less, or most preferably 0.001<br>
μM or less. Indeed, inhibitors with Ki values in the lower micromolar, preferably the nanomolar<br>
and even more preferably the picomolar range are contemplated. Thus, while the active agents<br>
 are described herein, for convenience, as "QC inhibitors", it will be understood that such<br>
nomenclature is not intending to limit the subject of the invention to a particular mechanism of<br>
action.<br>
Molecular weight of QC inhibitors In general, the QC inhibitors of the subject method or medical use will be small molecules, e.g.,<br>
with molecular weights of 500 g/mole or less, 400 g/mole or less, preferably of 350 g/mole or<br>
less, and even more preferably of 300 g/mole or less and even of 250 g/mole or less.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br><br><br><br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that amount of active<br>
compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue<br>
system, animal or human being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other<br>
clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" embraces both human and veterinary<br>
use: For example the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" embraces a veterinarily acceptable<br>
compound or a compound acceptable in human medicine and health care.<br>

Stereoisomers:<br>
All possible stereoisomers of the claimed compounds are included in the present invention.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral center, they may<br>
accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more chiral centers,<br><br><br><br>
they may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and<br>
mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preparation and isolation of stereoisomers:<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise<br>
to a mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques<br>
such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or<br>
individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution.<br>
The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their components enantiomers by standard<br>
techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically<br>
active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed<br>
by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be<br>
resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved<br>
using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts:<br>
In view of the close relationship between the free compounds and the compounds in the form of<br>
their salts or solvates, whenever a compound is referred to in this context, a corresponding salt<br>
or solvate is also intended, provided such is possible or appropriate under the circumstances.<br>
Salts and solvates of the compounds of formula (I) and physiologically functional derivatives<br>
thereof which are suitable for use in medicine are those wherein the counter-ion or associated<br>
solvent is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts and solvates having non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable counter-ions or associated solvents are within the scope of the<br>
present invention, for example, for use as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds<br>
and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>

acceptable base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as those of sodium and<br>
potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium and magnesium and salts with<br>
organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine and N-methyl-D-glucamine.<br>
All pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms of the compounds of the present<br>
invention are intended to be embraced by the scope of this invention.<br>
Polymorph crystal forms:<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms of the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as<br>
such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds<br>
may form solvates with water (i.e. hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are<br>
also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention. The compounds, including<br>
their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for<br>
their crystallization.<br>
Prodrugs:<br>
The present invention further includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this<br>
invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are<br>
readily convertible in vivo into the desired therapeutically active compound. Thus, in these<br>
cases, the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall<br>
encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with prodrug versions of one or<br>
more of the claimed compounds, but which converts to the above specified compound in vivo<br>
after administration to the subject. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of<br>
suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.<br>
Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Protective Groups:<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may<br>
be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules<br>
concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those<br>
described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973;<br>

Therapeutic uses<br>
Physiological substrates of QC (EC) in mammals are, e.g. amyloid beta-peptides β-40), β-42),<br>
(11-40 and (11-42), ABri, ADan, Gastrin, Neurotensin, FPP, CCL 2, CCL 7, CCL 8, CCL 16,<br>
CCL 18, Fractalkine, Orexin A, [Gln3]-glucagonβ-29), [Gln5]-substance P(5-11) and the peptide<br>
QYNAD. For further details see table 1. The compounds and/or combinations according to the<br>
present invention and pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one inhibitor of QC (EC)<br>
are useful for the treatment of conditions that can be treated by modulation of QC activity.<br><br><br><br>
Table 1: Amino acid sequences of physiological active peptides with an N-terminal<br>
glutamine residue, which are prone to be cyclized to final pGlu<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Glutamate is found in positions 3, 11 and 22 of the amyloid β-peptide. Among them the mutation<br>
from glutamic acid (E) to glutamine (Q) in position 22 (corresponding to amyloid precursor<br>
protein APP 693, Swissprot P05067) has been described as the so called Dutch type<br>
cerebroarterial amyloidosis mutation.<br>
The p-amyloid peptides with a pyroglutamic acid residue in position 3, 11 and/or 22 have been<br>
described to be more cytotoxic and hydrophobic than the amyloid β-peptides 1-40(42/43) (Saido<br>
T.C. 2000 Medical Hypotheses 54β): 427-429).<br>
The multiple N-terminal variations, e.g. Abeta(3-40), Abeta β-42), Abeta(11-40) and Abeta (11-<br>
42) can be generated by the β-secretase enzyme β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving<br><br><br><br>
enzyme (BACE) at different sites (Huse J.T. et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277 (18): 16278-16284),<br>
and/or by aminopeptidase or dipeptidylaminopeptidase processing from the full lenght peptides<br>
Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). In all cases, cyclization of the then N-terminal occuring glutamic<br>
acid residue is catalyzed by QC.<br>
Transepithelial transducing cells, particularly the gastrin (G) cell, co-ordinate gastric acid<br>
secretion with the arrival of food in the stomach. Recent work showed that multiple active<br>
products are generated from the gastrin precursor, and that there are multiple control points in<br>
gastrin biosynthesis. Biosynthetic precursors and intermediates (progastrin and Gly-gastrins)<br>
are putative growth factors; their products, the amidated gastrins, regulate epithelial cell<br>
proliferation, the differentiation of acid-producing parietal cells and histamine-secreting<br>
enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and the expression of genes associated with histamine<br>
synthesis and storage in ECL cells, as well as acutely stimulating acid secretion. Gastrin also<br>
stimulates the production of members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which in turn<br>
inhibit parietal cell function but stimulate the growth of surface epithelial cells. Plasma gastrin<br>
concentrations are elevated in subjects with Helicobacter pylori, who are known to have<br>
increased risk of duodenal ulcer disease and gastric cancer (Dockray, G.J. 1999 J Physiol 15<br>
315-324).<br>
The peptide hormone gastrin, released from antral G cells, is known to stimulate the synthesis<br>
and release of histamine from ECL cells in the oxyntic mucosa via CCK-2 receptors. The<br>
mobilized histamine induces acid secretion by binding to the H(2) receptors located on parietal<br>
cells. Recent studies suggest that gastrin, in both its fully amidated and less processed forms<br>
(progastrin and glycine-extended gastrin), is also a growth factor for the gastrointestinal tract. It<br>
has been established that the major trophic effect of amidated gastrin is for the oxyntic mucosa<br>
of stomach, where it causes increased proliferation of gastric stem cells and ECL cells, resulting<br>
in increased parietal and ECL cell mass. On the other hand, the major trophic target of the less<br>
processed gastrin (e.g.. glycine-extended gastrin) appears to be the colonic mucosa (Koh, T.J.<br>
and Chen, D. 2000 Regul Pept 9337-44).<br>
Neurotensin (NT) is a neuropeptide implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia that<br>
specifically modulates neurotransmitter systems previously demonstrated to be misregulated in<br>
this disorder. Clinical studies in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NT concentrations have been<br>
measured revealed a subset of schizophrenic patients with decreased CSF NT concentrations<br>
that are restored by effective antipsychotic drug treatment. Considerable evidence also exists<br>
concordant with the involvement of NT systems in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic<br>
drugs. The behavioral and biochemical effects of centrally administered NT remarkably<br><br><br><br>
resemble those of systemically administered antipsychotic drugs, and antipsychotic drugs<br>
increase NT neurotransmission. This concatenation of findings led to the hypothesis that NT<br>
functions as an endogenous antipsychotic. Moreover, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs<br>
differentially alter NT neurotransmission in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine terminal<br>
regions, and these effects are predictive of side effect liability and efficacy, respectively (Binder,<br>
E. B. et al. 2001 Biol Psychiatry 50 856-872).<br>
Fertilization promoting peptide (FPP), a tripeptide related to thyrotropin releasing hormone<br>
(TRH), is found in seminal plasma. Recent evidence obtained in vitro and in vivo showed that<br>
FPP plays an important role in regulating sperm fertility. Specifically, FPP initially stimulates<br>
nonfertilizing (uncapacitated) spermatozoa to "switch on" and become fertile more quickly, but<br>
then arrests capacitation so that spermatozoa do not undergo spontaneous acrosome loss and<br>
therefore do not lose fertilizing potential. These responses are mimicked, and indeed<br>
augmented, by adenosine, known to regulate the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP signal<br>
transduction pathway. Both FPP and adenosine have been shown to stimulate cAMP<br>
production in uncapacitated cells but inhibit it in capacitated cells, with FPP receptors somehow<br>
interacting with adenosine receptors and G proteins to achieve regulation of AC. These events<br>
affect the tyrosine phosphorylation state of various proteins, some being important in the initial<br>
"switching on," others possibly being involved in the acrosome reaction itself. Calcitonin and<br>
angiotensin II, also found in seminal plasma, have similar effects in vitro on uncapacitated<br>
spermatozoa and can augment responses to FPP. These molecules have similar effects in vivo,<br>
affecting fertility by stimulating and then maintaining fertilizing potential. Either reductions in the<br>
availability of FPP, adenosine, calcitonin, and angiotensin II or defects in their receptors<br>
contribute to male infertility (Fraser, L.R. and Adeoya-Osiguwa, S. A. 2001 Vitam Horm 63, 1-<br>
28).<br>
CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL16, CCL18 and fractalkine play an important role in pathophysiological<br>
conditions, such as suppression of proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, neoplasia,<br>
inflammatory host responses, cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, vasculitis,<br>
humoral and cell-mediated immunity responses, leukocyte adhesion and migration processes at<br>
the endothelium, inflammatory bowel disease, restenosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary<br>
hypertention, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, nephrosclerosis, ventricular remodeling, heart failure,<br>
adenopathy after organ transplantations and failure of vein grafts.<br>
Several cytotoxic T lymphocyte peptide-based vaccines against hepatitis B, human<br>
immunodeficiency virus and melanoma were recently studied in clinical trials. One interesting<br>
melanoma vaccine candidate alone or in combination with other tumor antigens, is the<br><br><br><br>
decapeptide ELA. This peptide is a Melan-A/MART-1 antigen immunodominant peptide analog,<br>
with an N-terminal glutamic acid. It has been reported that the amino group and gamma-<br>
carboxylic group of glutamic acids, as well as the amino group and gamma-carboxamide group<br>
of glutamines, condense easily to form pyroglutamic derivatives. To overcome this stability<br>
problem, several peptides of pharmaceutical interest have been developed with a pyroglutamic<br>
acid instead of N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid, without loss of pharmacological<br>
properties. Unfortunately compared with ELA, the pyroglutamic acid derivative (PyrELA) and<br>
also the N-terminal acetyl-capped derivative (AcELA) failed to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte<br>
(CTL) activity. Despite the apparent minor modifications introduced in PyrELA and AcELA,<br>
these two derivatives probably have lower affinity than ELA for the specific class I major<br>
histocompatibility complex. Consequently, in order to conserve full activity of ELA, the formation<br>
of PyrELA must be avoided (Beck A. et al. 2001, J Pept Res 57(6):528-38.).<br>
Orexin A is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in the regulation of food intake and<br>
sleep-wakefulness, possibly by coordinating the complex behavioral and physiologic responses<br>
of these complementary homeostatic functions. It plays also a role in the homeostatic regulation<br>
of energy metabolism, autonomic function, hormonal balance and the regulation of body fluids.<br>
Recently, increased levels of the pentapeptide QYNAD were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid<br>
(CSF) of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome compared to<br>
healthy individuals (Brinkmeier H. et al. 2000, Nature Medicine 6, 808-811). There is a big<br>
controversy in the literature about the mechanism of action of the pentapeptide Gln-Tyr-Asn-<br>
Ala-Asp (QYNAD), especially its efficacy to interact with and block sodium channels resulting in<br>
the promotion of axonal dysfunction, which are involved in inflammatory autoimmune diseases<br>
of the central nervous system. But recently, it could be demonstrated that not QYNAD, but its<br>
cyclized, pyroglutamated form, pEYNAD, is the active form, which blocks sodium channels<br>
resulting in the promotion of axonal dysfunction. Sodium channels are expressed at high density<br>
in myelinated axons and play an obligatory role in conducting action potentials along axons<br>
within the mammalian brain and spinal cord. Therefore, it is speculated that they are involved in<br>
several aspects of the pathophysiology of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, especially<br>
multiple sclerosis, the Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinizing<br>
polyradiculoneuropathy.<br>
Furthermore, QYNAD is a substrate of the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5), which<br>
is also present in the brain of mammals, especially in human brain. Glutaminyl cyclase<br>
catalyzes effectively the formation of pEYNAD from its precursor QYNAD.<br><br><br><br>

Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, at least one compound of formula<br>
(I) optionally in combination with at least one of the other aforementioned agents can be used<br>
as the active ingredient(s). The active ingredient(s) is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may<br>
take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration,<br>
e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage<br>
form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral<br>
preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and<br>
additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents<br>
and the like; for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, gelcaps and<br>
tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents,<br>
lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration,<br>
tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case<br>
solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or<br>
enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile<br>
water, though other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for<br>
preservation, may be included.<br>
Injectable suspensions may also prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending<br>
agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per<br>
dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the<br>
active ingredient(s) necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder,<br>
injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, from about 0.03 mg to 100 mg/kg (preferred 0.1<br>
-	30 mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.1 - 300 mg/kg per day (preferred 1<br>
-	50 mg/kg per day) of each active ingredient or combination thereof. The dosages, however,<br><br><br><br>
may be varied depending upon the requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition<br>
being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-<br>
periodic dosing may be employed.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules,<br>
powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays,<br>
drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual<br>
or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the<br>
composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly<br>
administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate<br>
salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing<br>
solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol,<br>
talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical<br>
diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous<br>
mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the<br>
active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may<br>
be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules.<br>
This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type<br>
described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of each active ingredient or combinations<br>
thereof of the present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the compositions of the present invention can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the<br>
latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated<br>
by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner<br>
component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material<br>
can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric<br>
acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
This liquid forms in which the compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for<br>
administration orally or by injection include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups,<br>
aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and<br><br><br><br>
natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may contain between about 0.01 mg and 100 mg, preferably<br>
about 5 to 50 mg, of each compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the<br>
mode of administration selected. Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical<br>
excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants,<br>
sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration<br>
include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release,<br>
timed release and sustained release formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms,<br>
such as solutions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral<br>
administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily<br>
dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times<br>
daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form<br>
via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of transdermal delivery system,<br>
the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the<br>
dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug<br>
component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier<br>
such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable<br>
binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the<br>
mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as<br>
glucose or betalactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia,<br>
tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium<br>
acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl<br>
cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms in suitable flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and<br>
natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose and the like. For parenteral<br>
administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which<br>
generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is<br>
desired.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds or combinations of the present invention can also be administered in the form<br>
of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and<br>
multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as<br>
cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds or combinations of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The<br>
compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable<br>
drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer,<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamid-ephenol, or polyethyl<br>
eneoxidepolyllysine substituted with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the<br>
present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example, polyactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy<br>
butyeric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-<br>
linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Compounds or combinations of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever treatment of<br>
the addressed disorders is required.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 1.000 mg per<br>
mammal per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form<br>
of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200,<br>
250 and 500 milligrams of each active ingredient or combinations thereof for the symptomatic<br>
adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is<br>
ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg of body weight<br>
per day. Preferably, the range is from about 1 to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The<br>
compounds or combinations may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and<br>
will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the<br>
preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of disease condition. In addition,<br>
factors associated with the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet<br>
and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br><br><br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I) optionally in combination with at<br>
least one of the other aforementioned agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compositions are preferably in a unit dosage form in an amount appropriate for the relevant<br>
daily dosage.<br>
Suitable dosages, including especially unit dosages, of the the compounds of the present<br>
invention include the known dosages including unit doses for these compounds as described or<br>
referred to in reference text such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia<br>

Synthesis of the examples<br>
Synthesis scheme 1:<br>
The compounds were synthesized according the general synthesis scheme 1 and their<br>
identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Amine (IV), 50 ul 0.2M, in methanol (dry) was dispensed on 96-well plates. Aldehyde (Va),<br>
50 ul 0.2M in methanol (dry) was then added. The well plates were stacked for 30 minutes at<br>
room temperature. Subsequently isocyanide (III), 50 ul 0.2 M, in methanol (dry) and 50 ul 1M<br>
Trimethylsilylazide was added. The well plates were sealed and stacked for 48 hours at room<br>
temperature. After completion, the solvent was evaporated.<br>
All compounds were immediately tested regarding their activity as hQC inhibitors. IC5o values<br>
were found to be in the range of 0.01 to 10 uM when tested directly following synthesis (i.e.<br>
without purification).<br>
Detailed synthesis description<br>
Certain compounds of the invention were prepared by preparative synthesis following<br>
essentially the route used for the parallel synthesis.<br>
General workup<br>
The appropriate amine (IV) (1 mmol) and aldehyde (Va) (1 mmol) were combined in<br>
methanol (2 ml, dry). After 2 hours Trimethylsilylazide (5mmol) and the appropriate<br>
isocyanide (III) (1mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 48h.<br>
After evaporation of the solvent the residue was purified with chromatographic methods.<br>
The purity of the compounds was determined by HPLC-MS. The IC5o value against hQC was<br>
measured using the fluorescent assay.<br><br><br><br>

wavelengths were 320/410 nm. The assay reactions were initiated by addition of glutaminyl<br>
cyclase. QC activity was determined from a standard curve of β-naphthylamine under assay<br>
conditions. One unit is defined as the amount of QC catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol pGlu-<br>
(3NA from H-Gln-pNA per minute under the described conditions.<br>
In a second fluorometric assay, QC was activity determined using H-Gln-AMC as substrate.<br>
Reactions were carried out at 30°C utilizing the NOVOStar reader for microplates (BMG<br>
labtechnologies). The samples consisted of varying concentrations of the fluorogenic<br>
substrate, 0.1 U pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (Qiagen) in 0.05 M Tris/HCI, pH 8.0 containing<br>
5 mM EDTA and an appropriately diluted aliquot of QC in a final volume of 250 ul.<br>
Excitation/emission wavelengths were 380/460 nm. The assay reactions were initiated by<br>
addition of glutaminyl cyclase. QC activity was determined from a standard curve of 7-amino-<br>
4-methylcoumarin under assay conditions. The kinetic data were evaluated using GraFit<br>
sofware.<br>
Spectrophotometric assay of QC<br>
This novel assay was used to determine the kinetic parameters for most of the QC<br>
substrates. QC activity was analyzed spectrophotometrically using a continuous method, that<br>
was derived by adapting a previous discontinuous assay (Bateman, R. C. J. 1989 J<br>
Neurosci Methods 30, 23-28) utilizing glutamate dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzyme.<br>
Samples consisted of the respective QC substrate, 0.3 mM NADH, 14 mM a-Ketoglutaric<br>
acid and 30 U/ml glutamate dehydrogenase in a final volume of 250 ul. Reactions were<br><br><br><br>
started by addition of QC and persued by monitoring of the decrease in absorbance at 340<br>
nm for 8-15 min.<br>
The initial velocities were evaluated and the enzymatic activity was determined from a<br>
standard curve of ammonia under assay conditions. All samples were measured at 30°C,<br>
using either the SPECTRAFIuor Plus or the Sunrise (both from TECAN) reader for<br>
microplates. Kinetic data was evaluated using GraFit software.<br>
Inhibitor assay<br>
For inhibitor testing, the sample composition was the same as described above, except of<br>
the putative inhibitory compound added. For a rapid test of QC-inhibition, samples contained<br>
4 mM of the respective inhibitor and a substrate concentration at 1 KM. For detailed<br>
investigations of the inhibition and determination of Ki-values, influence of the inhibitor on the<br>
auxiliary enzymes was investigated first. In every case, there was no influence on either<br>
enzyme detected, thus enabling the reliable determination of the QC inhibition. The inhibitory<br>
constant was evaluated by fitting the set of progress curves to the general equation for<br>
competitive inhibition using GraFit software.<br>
Example 2: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry<br>
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was carried out using the<br>
Hewlett-Packard G2025 LD-TOF System with a linear time of flight analyzer. The instrument<br>
was equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, a potential acceleration source (5 kV) and a<br>
1.0 m flight tube. Detector operation was in the positive-ion mode and signals are recorded<br>
and filtered using LeCroy 9350M digital storage oscilloscope linked to a personal computer.<br>
Samples (5 μl) were mixed with equal volumes of the matrix solution. For matrix solution<br>
DHAP/DAHC was used, prepared by solving 30 mg 2',6'-dihydroxyacetophenone (Aldrich)<br>
and 44 mg diammonium hydrogen citrate (Fluka) in 1 ml acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in water (1/1,<br>
v/v). A small volume (= 1 μl) of the matrix-analyte-mixture was transferred to a probe tip and<br>
immediately evaporated in a vacuum chamber (Hewlett-Packard G2024A sample prep<br>
accessory) to ensure rapid and homogeneous sample crystallization.<br>
For long-term testing of Glu1-cyclization, Aβ-derived peptides were incubated in 100μl 0.1 M<br>
sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2 or 0.1 M Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.5 at 30°C. Peptides were applied<br>
in 0.5 mM [A0(3-11)a] or 0.15 mM [Ap(3-21)a] concentrations, and 0.2 U QC is added all 24<br>
hours. In case of A(3(3-21)a, the assays contained 1 % DMSO. At different times, samples<br>
are removed from the assay tube, peptides extracted using ZipTips (Millipore) according to<br>
the manufacturer's recommendations, mixed with matrix solution (1:1 v/v) and subsequently<br><br><br><br>
the mass spectra recorded. Negative controls either contain no QC or heat deactivated<br>
enzyme. For the inhibitor studies the sample composition was the same as described above,<br>
with exception of the inhibitory compound added (5 mM or 2 mM of a test compound of<br>
formula (I)).<br>
The first QC inhibitors were disclosed in WO 2004/098591 and WO 2005/075436. There are<br>
no other potent QC inhibitors known in the art. The same holds true for combinations and<br>
compositions for the treatment of neuronal diseases comprising QC inhibitors. Compounds<br>
and combinations of the invention may have the advantage that they are, for example, more<br>
potent, more selective, have fewer side-effects, have better formulation and stability<br>
properties, have better pharmacokinetic properties, be more bioavailable, be able to cross<br>
blood brain barrier and are more effective in the brain of mammals, are more compatible or<br>
effective in combination with other drugs or be more readily synthesized than other<br>
compounds of the prior art.<br>
