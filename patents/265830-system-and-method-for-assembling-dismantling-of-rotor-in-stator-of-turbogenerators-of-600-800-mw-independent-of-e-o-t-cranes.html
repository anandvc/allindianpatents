				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for assembling and<br>
dismantling of rotor in stator of turbogenerators of 600-800 MW, independent of<br>
E.O.T. cranes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Conventionally the Rotors of 600-800 MW turbogenerators are assembled and<br>
dismantled at test bed. Rotor assembly into and dismantling from stator is<br>
carried out with the help of E.O.T. crane. When the positions of Rotor at test bed<br>
for its assembly into and dismantling from stator lie outside the bay of E.O.T.<br>
crane, the use of E.O.T. crane is not feasible. This necessitated to find a method<br>
which enables a process of rotor assembly into and dismantling from stator of a<br>
turbogenerator to be carried out independent of E.O.T. crane.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a system and method of<br>
Rotor assembly into and dismantling from a stator of a turbogenerator<br>
particularly of higher capacity of 600-800 MW independent of the E.O.T. crane<br>
when its position at the test bed is outside E.O.T. bay.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a system comprising of an erection base<br>
placed on trailer, roller trolleys, support blocks, tie rods, guide strips and guide<br>
bars. The erection base supports the rotor at appropriate height on flat bed<br>
trailer. The centre line of stator bore is aligned with that of rotor. The roller<br>
trolley system supports and guides the rotor during its assembly and disassembly<br>
into stator frame.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig.1- shows the erection base for Turbogenerator rotor.<br>
Fig.2- shows the method of insertion of a rotor into a stator frame by steps as<br>
depicted by fig I to fig V and support details in VI to VIII.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention as depicted in the accompanying<br>
drawings will now be explained in details. However, there can be several<br>
embodiments all of which are deemed covered by this specification.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a Rotor body assembly into a stator of a turbogenerator<br>
and dismantling from it, both being parts of a turbogenerator unit by a method<br>
without an E.O.T. crane, in a Power Plant. The system comprises of an erection<br>
base (50) which is a fabricated steel structure and is fixed on a flat bed trailer<br>
(51). The erection base (50) supports the rotor at appropriate height on flat bed<br>
trailer. The rotor (52) is supported on erection base (50) using roller trolleys<br><br>
(26). The roller trolleys system supports and guides the rotor (52) during its<br>
assembly and disassembly into stator frame. This construction along with various<br>
support blocks (11,12,15,16,24,32,33,34) and Tie rods (13,31) have been made<br>
for handling a rotor for example of 800 MW Turbogenerator. The same system<br>
can be used on the same erection base by simply changing the support blocks<br>
and Tie rods suiting the requirements of for example 600 and 660 MW<br>
Turbogenerator rotor assembly into and dismantling from stator.<br>
For the process of rotor (52) assembly into the stator (54), the rotor (52) is<br>
placed on the trolleys (26,27) above the trailer (51) and erection base (50) with<br>
the help of EOT crane available in shop assembly area. After rotor assembly on<br>
trolleys, the movement of roller trolleys (26,27) is locked by using suitable<br>
stoppers for transportation of the trailer (51) (with rotor and erection base<br>
assembled on it) to the test bed area. After trailer (51) has been brought to the<br>
proper position in front of support pedestals (55) (for test shaft assembly) at test<br>
bed, the stoppers are removed and erection base (50) end is locked to support<br>
pedestals (55) ensuring plane movement surface for roller trolleys (26,27) with<br>
rotor (52) mounted on them. For the process of rotor dismantling from the<br>
stator, first the trolley (27) for EE location is assembled on-to the rotor (52),after<br>
it comes out of stator bore to desired extent. Later after barrel portion comes out<br>
of stator bore to desired extent, the trolley (26) for barrel location is assembled<br>
on-to the rotor.<br>
The trailer (51) is moved by motor, which is part of it. Hence trailer can be<br>
moved from assembly area to test bed area as required.<br>
The height of the erection base (50) and roller trolleys (26) is selected to match<br>
the axis of rotor with the centerline of stator (54) at test bed. The positions of<br>
rotor for its assembly/dismantling at test bed lies outside the E.O.T. crane bay.<br><br>
The height of Stator axis is worked out from the stator (54) and its support<br>
pedestals (55) at test bed and reconfirmed after assembly. The height of<br>
erection base (50) is determined considering the trailer (51) and trolley (26,27)<br>
heights so as to achieve the same height of rotor axis. As the rotor (52) is<br>
pushed inside the stator (54), it gets supported in the stator bore at its TE<br>
bearing location by sliding pedestal (4) and skid plate (2). The heights of sliding<br>
pedestal (4) and skid plate (2) have been so designed that rotor axis coincides<br>
with stator bore axis. Next rotor gets supported inside stator bore at rotor barrel<br>
near TE retaining ring by skid shoe (5) and skid plate (2). The heights of skid<br>
shoe (5) and skid plate (2) have been so designed that rotor axis coincides with<br>
stator bore axis. Lastly rotor (52) is supported inside the stator bore at barrel<br>
near EE retaining ring by stack of press board shims (30) and skid plate (2). The<br>
height of stack of press board shims (30) is kept same as that of skid shoe<br>
(5),thus ensuring that rotor axis coincides with stator axis. Thus alignment is<br>
ensured during the entire processes of rotor (52) assembly as well as dismantling<br>
from the stator (54).<br>
The structure of Erection Base (50) has a number of plate items (41,42,43,44)<br>
welded suitably with one another. Two top plates (42) of the erection base are<br>
provided with guide strips (48) for guiding the movement of roller trolleys (26).<br>
The longitudinal plates (41,47) welded with transverse plates (44) are provided<br>
with stiffeners (45,46) to support the load of moving rotor (52) and transverse<br>
forces during short distance transportation respectively. The height of erection<br>
base (50) and roller trolleys (26) is selected to match the axis of rotor (52) with<br>
the centerline of stator (54) at test bed. The stress analysis of erection base (50)<br>
is carried out for conditions of moving load of rotor during its assembly and<br>
dismantling with stator as well as those of short distance transportation in shop<br>
blocks. The design of erection base (50) has been developed and optimized<br>
using Finite Element Analysis technique. Different Design variants have been<br>
analyzed using parameters like thickness and width of plates to optimise the<br><br>
design. Adequate factor of safety has been ensured with respect to the yield<br>
strength of the material under all loading condition.<br>
Guiding bars (3) are provided on top of Erection base (50) as well as above<br>
excitor support pedestals (55) at test bed to ensure the movement of rotor (52)<br>
in axial direction only Trolleys (27) for EE (exciter end) Journal has a base plate<br>
(22) on top of it which is assembled with two support blocks (15,24) and a<br>
channel (25) by tie rods (13) at two end allowing the EE Journal to seat. Trolleys<br>
(26) for Rotor barrel has a Base plate (8) which is assembled with two support<br>
blocks (12) and a channel (10) by tie rods (31).<br>
The sliding pedestal (4) is an assembly of fabricated steel body having 6mm<br>
thick PTFE sheet at bottom. Skid plate (2) is also an assembly of smoothly<br>
machined steel plate having PVC sheet at bottom. PTFE sheet of sliding pedestal<br>
(4) slides over the greased steel surface of skid plate (2) with a very low<br>
coefficient of friction, thus reducing the effort required for push/pull using the<br>
pulling machine. Similarly skid shoe (5) has PTFE sheet at its bottom for sliding<br>
over skid plate (2).<br>
The method of rotor (52) assembly into a stator (54) begins with the rotor (52)<br>
being assembled on top of erection base (50) and trailer (51) with roller trolleys<br>
(26,27) using base plates (8,22), tie rods (13,31), support blocks (11,12,15),<br>
channels (10,25) at barrel center and exciter end (EE) bearing positions. Also<br>
rotor (52) is assembled with sliding pedestal (4) assembly at bearing position on<br>
turbine end (TE). Trolleys (26,27) are put at EE Journal and Rotor barrel position<br>
(section A-A and B-B). Trailer (51) is brought adjacent to supporting pedestal<br>
(55) and trailer height is adjusted to align top surfaces of pedestal (55) and<br>
erection base (50). Then guide bars (3) is aligned on Pedestal (55) top surface.<br>
Blower covering is then removed but the blower protection ring is left on blower<br>
protection rim (53). Care is taken that at no time any load comes on either of<br><br>
retaining rings which are end-supported and enclose rotor winding overhang<br>
parts or on compressor blades. The position of these support points are so<br>
selected that during the movement of rotor (52) it always remains supported at<br>
least at two places, even when some of these supports are removed or<br>
disassembled before pushing rotor (52) further inside the stator (54). The skid<br>
plate (2) and Boards (9) are placed and Grease (23) is applied on skid plate (2),<br>
sliding pedestal (4) and skid shoe (5) to minimize the friction. End shield upper<br>
halves, shaft seals and Bearings of both turbine end (TE) and exciter end (EE)<br>
are not assembled before starting the rotor assembly process. End shield lower<br>
halves are lowered from normal position and kept hanging from sides of support<br>
pedestal (55) at test bed by specially designed brackets. Rotor (52) is gradually<br>
pushed towards stator (54) by using pulling machine (38) with wire rope<br>
anchored from stator (54). After some movement, sliding pedestal (4) supports<br>
rotor (52) inside stator (54) bore. After roller trolley (26) gets free of support<br>
from exciter support pedestals (55), it is disassembled. During the movement of<br>
rotor barrel (52) inside the stator bore (54), the rotor barrel is supported at TE<br>
by inserting skid shoe (5) by pulling with polyster cords drawn towards TE just<br>
after the retaining ring TE has entered inside stator bore (54). A stack of Press<br>
boards (30) provided with strings for guiding placement and removal, is inserted<br>
after travel of half length of rotor (52) barrel inside the stator bore (54) and an<br>
additional stack of press boards (30) is inserted just before entry of retaining ring<br>
EE in stator bore (54) on Exciter side (EE). End shield lower half TE is lifted to its<br>
normal position after TE coupling flange of rotor (52) comes out clear of end<br>
shield TE. The rotor (52) is supported by assembling rotor insertion cross beam<br>
TE (6) with end shield TE. Skid shoe (5) on TE is removed and shaft seal TE and<br>
bearing TE are assembled. Next end shield lower half EE is lifted to its normal<br>
position and rotor (52) is supported on rotor insertion cross beam EE (7)<br>
assembled with end shield lower half EE. Press boards (30) are removed. Skid<br>
plate (2) is removed after turning it around rotor (52) to upper side of bore.<br>
Press boards (9) is also removed. Then Bearing lower half TE is placed on Rotor<br><br>
Journal TE lifting the rotor (52) using cross beams (6,7). Similarly with rotor (52)<br>
lifted using cross beam EE (7), bearing lower half EE is placed on rotor journal<br>
EE. Cross-beams (6,7) are removed. Rotor (52) is then aligned and coupled with<br>
turbine rotor.<br>
For rotor dismantling, Generator rotor (52) is de-coupled from turbine rotor. End<br>
shield upper halves are removed. Rotor (52) is supported on rotor insertion cross<br>
beams TE and EE (6,7) and bearings and shaft seals TE and EE are removed.<br>
Skid plate (2) is inserted in the stator bore (54) above rotor (52) and turned<br>
around rotor (52) to position below rotor (52). Skid shoe (5) is inserted at TE<br>
just inside retaining ring TE and stack of press boards (30) is inserted just inside<br>
retaining ring EE. End shield EE is lowered and supported by special brackets<br>
(16) from intermediate support of exciter support pedestal (55) at test bed.<br>
Rotor insertion cross beam EE (7) is removed. End shield lower half TE is<br>
lowered and supported by special brackets (1) from intermediate support of<br>
pedestals at test bed. Rotor insertion cross beam TE (6) is removed. Sliding<br>
pedestal (4) is assembled on rotor (52) at TE bearing location. Rotor is gradually<br>
pulled out from stator (54) using pulling machine (38) with wire rope. Trolley<br>
(27) is assembled on rotor (52) at position of bearing EE (Section B-B) after it is<br>
clear of stator (54). On further pulling rotor (52) gets supported by this trolley<br>
(27) on intermediate support of support pedestal (55) at test bed and skid shoe<br>
(5) is taken out. As middle portion of rotor barrel (52) comes clear of stator (54),<br>
Trolley (26) is assembled on rotor (52) in that portion (Section A-A). Rotor (52)<br>
gets supported by this trolley (26) on intermediate support of pedestal (55) at<br>
test bed before sliding pedestal (4) comes out from Stator bore (54). Sliding<br>
pedestal (4) is disassembled. After more pulling, rotor (52) with trolleys (26,27)<br>
gets transferred into Erection base (50) and trailor (51) for further transportation<br>
of maintenance bay.<br><br>
