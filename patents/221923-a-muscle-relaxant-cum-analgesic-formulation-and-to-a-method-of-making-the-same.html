GRANTED <br>
22-11-2005<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
ORIGINAL	22 NOV 2005<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a synergistic muscle relaxant cum analgesic formulation and to a method  of making the same.<br>
WHAT THE INVENTION ENVISAGES<br>
Particularly, this invention envisages a synergistic formulation composition<br>
containing methocarbamol and paracetamol.<br>
The fixed dose combination of methocarbamol and paracetamol produce a synergistic response in the effective relief of pain.<br>
In particular this invention envisages a tablet formulation for oral administration of methocarbamol and paracetamol.<br>
PHARMACOLOGY OF METHOCARBAMOL<br>
Skeletal Muscle Relaxants primarily act in the central nervous system to produce muscle relaxant effects. Methocarbamol is one of the most trusted drugs, approved by U.S. F.D.A, for treating Skeletal Muscle Spasm. The mechanism of action of Methocarbamol is obscure. However it acts by producing CNS depression although no action was found on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle and the motor ended plate or the nerve fibre.<br>
Methocarbamol is generally a fast acting drug with onset of action within 30 minutes after oral administration, while the peak serum level is achieved in 2 hours.<br><br><br>
Oral Methocarbamol is mainly indicated for painful skeletal muscle spasm of the dorsal region and also for spasm due to sports injuries.<br>
PHARMACOLOGY OF PARACETAMOL<br>
Paracetamol is one of the most widely used analgesics and is regarded to offer highest degree of safety and tolerabiliry in the recommended dose. Although its mode of action is not fully understood, Paracetamol is believed to inhibit cyclo- oxygenase (COX) in the central nervous system, besides exerting action on the peripheral pain chemoreceptors (Bradykinin).<br>
Like Methocarbamol, Paracetamol is immediately acting, thus has a matching pharmacokinetic profile.<br>
The said formulation combines the time tested Skeletal Muscle Relaxant, Methocarbamol and the safe analgesic, Paracetamol. The said formulation is quite useful for various Skeletal Muscle Spasms that are mild to moderate in nature.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of methocarbamol used in the formulation is<br>
preferably as pure methocarbamol or any pharmaceutically acceptable form<br>
such as methocarbamol (micronised) or any other steriochemical pure form of<br>
it.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of paracetamol used in the formulation is<br>
preferably paracetamol in its pure form or any pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
form.<br><br><br>
The two active materials in the formulation can be formulated within a dosage form wherein the two active materials are mixed along with excipients to form a uniform blend and thereafter bound with suitable binder to form granules of the mixed active blend which may be coated with suitable film forming agents to obtain a layer of coat that mainly improve the product appearance.<br>

Each tablet contains:<br>
Methocarbamol	250 mg<br>
Paracetamol	125 mg<br>
MANUFACTURING PROCESS (Batch Size 1 Lakhs Tablet)<br>
Step - 1:     Manufacturing of the granules<br>
25 Kg of methocarbamol, 12.5 kg of paracetamol, 4.0 kg of microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, 3.0 kg of microcrystalline cellulose and 1.0 kg of cross carmellose<br>
sodium were passed through a 40-mesh sieve and placed in a planetary mixer.<br>
The ambient temperature was maintained below 25 degrees Celsius and the<br>
relative humidity below 60%. The mixer was run for 25 minutes at 30 r.p.m.<br>
so that a homogenous mixture of the particles of active ingredients and the<br>
above said inert excipients resulted.<br>
1.50 kg of starch mixed with 2 Kg of purified water in a stainless steel [s.s.]<br>
tank under continuous stirring to obtain slurry. Simultaneously heat 5 kgs of<br>
purified water in a jacketed steam vessel till boiling. Add the above said slurry<br>
to this boiling purified water until the binder was completely dispersed in the<br>
solvent to form a translucent paste. The paste was then added to the planetary<br>
mixer containing the homogenous mixture of the particles of active molecules<br>
with the excipients.<br>
Wet mixing was then commenced for 20 minutes at 15 r.p.m. to obtain a wet<br>
homogenous mixture mass.<br><br><br>
The   wet homogenous mixture mass was milled, in a multimill fitted with 12<br>
mm perforated sieve to obtain granules of mesh size 8 to 12 mm.<br>
The wet granules were subjected to drying:<br>
The granules were subjected to heated drying at a temperature of 50 to 60<br>
degrees Celsius in a tray drier for 6 hrs. The drying mass was raked during the<br>
process. The Loss on drying was 1.3%.<br>
The dry granules were sifted in an 18-mesh vibrosifter to obtain uniform sized<br>
granules.<br>
Step - 2: Lubrication<br>
Through a vibrosifter of mesh size 40 meshes the following materials were<br>
passed:<br>
1.5 kg sodium starch glycollate, 0.500 kg of sodium lauryl sulfate and 0.6 kg<br>
of magnesium stearate. This sifted mass (except magnesium stearate) along<br>
with the dried granules were transferred to a double cone blender at<br>
temperature of 22 degrees Celsius and the mass was blended at speed of 30<br>
r.p.m. for 25 minutes. 0.6 kg of magnesium stearate; was then added to the<br>
blender and further blending was done for 5 minutes resulting in the lubricated<br>
core mass.<br>
Step - 3 : Compression<br>
This core mass was fed to hopper of a single rotary compression machine and the compression pressure was set at 3 kg/sq cm. 1,00,000 Cores were obtained: Dimension: capsule shape, Standard curvature, Avg weight of core 456 mg ± 3 %. Step - 5: film - coating<br><br><br><br><br>
The cores were coated with a film coating.<br>
A coating suspension was prepared by mixing 0.2 kg of ethyl cellulose; and 0.4 kg of hydroxypropyl cellulose and mixed together with 6 kg of isopropyl alcohol and 11 kg of Methylene chloride; 0.01 kg of diethyl phthalate, 0.05 kg of titanium dioxide in a s.s. container, and stirred for five minutes using overhead stirrer until a smooth slurry was obtained. The coating solution was sieved through 80-mesh sieve.<br>
The de-dusted cores were transferred into a coating pan and the tablet bed was heated by inching process using hot air blower.  The initial temperature was set at 40°C.  Once the tablet bed attains 45°C it was ready for spray coating with the coating suspension.    The cores were coated with the coating suspension. The relative humidity was maintained below 60 % throughout. The coated tablets were polished with talc. Final dimensions of the tablets were as follows: Dimension: capsule shape, Standard curvature, Avg weight of film coated tablet 462 mg ± 3 %.<br>
Trials were conducted by administering the tablets of the above examples to patients suffering from spasmodic pain. Patients were also administered paracetamol alone and separate tablets of paracetamol and methocarbamol. Significant results were obtained for the formulation of this invention over both paracetamol alone and the active ingredients administered separately. Unexpectedly, the relief was obtained significantly earlier [perceived to be at      least 15 to 30 minutes earlier] but was more satisfactory [perceived to be at least 16.2% better]. In addition the single dosage form of the two active ingredients improved patient compliance as well as the cost of manufacture.<br><br>
