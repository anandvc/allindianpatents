COMPRESSOR SLIDER, SLIDER PREFORM, SCROLL PART,<br>
AND COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a compressor, a compressor slider (scroll part,<br>
cylinder block, piston, roller, and the like), and a slider preform (scroll part preform, cylinder<br>
block preform, piston preform, roller preform, and the like).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A method for manufacturing a compressor slider has been proposed (e.g., see Patent<br>
Document 1) in which "a compressor slider preform is manufactured by semi-molten die<br>
casting." Adopting this manufacturing method allows high tensile strength and high<br>
hardness to be obtained in comparison with adopting sand casting.<br>
<patent document l> Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2005-36693.<br>
<patent document> Japanese Laid-open Utility model Application No. 4-134686.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
In a scroll compressor, for example, the distal end of a tooth tip of a scroll is<br>
ordinarily set so that an initial gap is provided with consideration given to deformation during<br>
operation. This is because when a portion of the tooth tip of the scroll makes contact during<br>
operation, large gaps are formed in other portion of the tooth tip, the thrust bearing surface<br>
becomes unstable, function cannot be achieved, the movable scroll becomes interposed<br>
between the fixed scroll and other components, damage is incurred, performance is reduced,<br>
or other problems occur. However, contact of the tooth tip may occur during operation due<br>
to machining tolerance of the parts, the condition of assembly based on geometric tolerance<br>
and/or combined tolerance, and an increase in temperature inside the scroll. The problem is<br>
gradually solved (this phenomenon is referred to as "breaking-in") by operating the<br>
compressor in this state and creating wear in the distal ends of the teeth of the scroll that are<br>
in contact with the fixed scroll or the movable scroll. In other words, rather ensuring<br>
maximum hardness in the movable scroll and the fixed scroll that is as hard as possible, a<br>
hardness is required that demonstrates sufficient durability and that allows "breaking-in" to<br>
occur as soon as possible. When the hardness of the movable scroll and the fixed scroll is<br>
extremely high, seizing resistance is degraded, seizing occurs between the teeth ends and the<br>
teeth bases (particularly in the center portion) in the scroll compressor wrap during<br>
pump-down operation (which readily occurs when a closed valve has inadvertently been left<br>
 <br>
unopened during installation, or in a refrigerant recovery operation during moving and<br>
reinstallation) or gas shortage operation (which occurs when refrigerant is insufficiently<br>
charged, has leaked from the piping, or has otherwise become insufficient), and the<br>
compressor is likely to break down and must be replaced. On the other hand, when the<br>
hardness of the movable scroll and the fixed scroll is extremely low, abrasion resistance is<br>
reduced, abnormal abrasion (on the order of several tens of micrometers) occurs during<br>
short-term abnormal operation (pump-down operation, gas shortage operation, and the like),<br>
the gap at the distal ends of scroll portion during normal operation becomes excessive, and<br>
performance is reduced. In extreme cases, operation is likely to become impossible because<br>
the discharge gas becomes too hot due to a reduction in performance caused by gas leakage.<br>
Ordinarily, the scroll portion of the movable scroll and the fixed scroll requires end milling,<br>
and problems of tool service life and cutting resistance therefore readily occur when the<br>
hardness is markedly high. In other words, when the movable scroll and the fixed scroll<br>
require machining, a level of hardness is required that allows sufficient machinability to be<br>
achieved and yet provides sufficient durability after completion. On the other hand, when<br>
the hardness of the movable scroll and the fixed scroll is extremely low, a built-up edge is<br>
readily formed and grinding is impeded because the ductility of the movable scroll and the<br>
fixed scroll is excessively high. Therefore, from this point as well, the movable scroll, the<br>
fixed scroll, and the like must be of sufficient hardness.<br>
The same applies to producing such a suitable hardness in the piston and cylinder<br>
block of a swing compressor, and in a roller and cylinder block of a rotary compressor. In<br>
particular, producing such a suitable hardness in a piston and cylinder block is as important as<br>
producing such a suitable hardness in a scroll part of a scroll compressor because the cylinder<br>
block and the piston always make contact in the same position in a swing compressor.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a slider that has high tensile strength,<br>
can demonstrate sufficient durability during operation, is readily "broken in" as soon as<br>
possible, and does not seize during abnormal operation, and to provide a compressor that<br>
incorporates such a slider. Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
compressor slider preform that exhibits good machinability.<br>
MEANS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The compressor slider according to a first aspect is a slider having a carbon content of 2.0<br>
wt% to 2.7 wt%, a silicon content of 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt%, a balance of iron that includes<br>
unavoidable impurities, graphite that is smaller than the flake graphite of flake graphite cast<br>
iron, and a hardness that is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 in at least a portion of<br>
 <br>
the slider. The hardness is more preferably greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 95.<br>
The hardness can be adjusted by a heating treatment that follows molding. As used herein,<br>
the term "slider" refers to a compressor slider, and examples include the following<br>
components of a scroll compressor: a movable scroll, a fixed scroll, a bearing, a rotating shaft<br>
(crankshaft), a rotation-preventing member, and a slide bush (slide block), as well as the<br>
following components of a swing compressor and a rotary compressor: a cylinder block, a<br>
front head, a rear head, a middle plate and rotating shaft (crankshaft), a piston, and a roller.<br>
When the "slider" is a cylinder block of a swing compressor or a rotary compressor, the<br>
hardness of at least the wall portion in which the cylinder hole is formed can be greater than<br>
HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. When the hardness of the slider is HRB 90 or less, the<br>
slider has poor abrasion resistance, abnormal abrasion (on the order of several tens of<br>
micrometers) occurs during short periods of abnormal operation (pump-down operation,<br>
insufficient gas operation, or the like), a gap at the distal end of the scroll portion during<br>
normal operation becomes excessively large, and performance is reduced. In extreme cases,<br>
performance is reduced due to gas leakage, the discharge gas becomes too hot, and operation<br>
is likely to be no longer possible. When the slider is a scroll part, it is possible that the<br>
effect of higher tensile strength of the scroll portion as a result of the improved tensile<br>
strength will no longer be sufficiently utilized. On the other hand, when the hardness of the<br>
slider is HRB 100 or greater, the seizing resistance of the slider is poor, seizing may occur in<br>
the scroll portion during abnormal operation (pump-down operation, insufficient gas<br>
operation, or the like) when the slider is a scroll part, and the compressor may malfunction<br>
and require replacement. The range in which the hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less<br>
than HRB 100 substantially corresponds to the range in which a ferrite surface area ratio of<br>
the base composition is from 50% to 5%. The graphite surface area ratio of the base<br>
composition substantially corresponds to a range from 6% to 2%. The range in which the<br>
hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 95 substantially corresponds to the range<br>
in which the ferrite surface area ratio of the base composition is less than 50% and greater<br>
than 25%. The graphite surface area ratio of the base composition substantially corresponds<br>
to a range that is less than 6% and greater than 3%. Such a compressor slider is<br>
manufactured by the semi-molten or semi-solid die casting and metal-mold casting of the<br>
above-described iron material, then rapidly cooling the molded material to convert the entire<br>
material to white iron, and then adjusting the hardness by heat treatment. When such a<br>
compressor slider is molded by semi-molten die casting or semi-solid die casting, the molded<br>
material can be given a near-net shape (a shape that approximates the final shape of the<br>
 <br>
product). On the other hand, the molded material must be brought to its final shape by<br>
precision machining when such a compressor slider is molded by metal-mold casting.<br>
The tensile strength of a molded article can be freely adjusted by heat treatment in a molded<br>
article obtained by subjecting iron having the components described above to semi-molten or<br>
semi-solid die casting and metal-mold casting, and thereafter rapidly cooling the molded<br>
material to convert the entire material to white iron. It has been made apparent that the<br>
tensile strength of a molded article manufactured via the heat treatment is in a proportional<br>
relationship with the hardness of the molded article. The range in which the hardness is<br>
greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 substantially corresponds to a range in which the<br>
tensile strength is from 600 MPa to 900 MPa. In other words, control of the tensile strength<br>
of the molded article can be substituted with the hardness, which is easy to measure. There<br>
are also merits when the slider is a scroll part in that the degree of freedom of design is<br>
considerably improved, and the scroll part has a reduced diameter and is provided with<br>
greater capacity. Therefore, the compressor slider demonstrates higher tensile strength than<br>
a slider composed of flake graphite cast iron. Based on experimental results obtained by the<br>
present inventor, it is apparent that when the hardness is in a range that is greater than HRB<br>
90 but less than HRB 100, the slider can demonstrate sufficient durability during compressor<br>
operation, "breaking-in" can occur as soon as possible, and seizing during abnormal operation<br>
does not occur. Since the slider exhibits suitable hardness, there are merits in that the slider<br>
is not easily damaged and is easy to handle. In summary of the above, the compressor slider<br>
has high tensile strength, demonstrates sufficient durability during operation, can be "broken<br>
in" as early as possible, and does not undergo seizing during abnormal operation. The<br>
compressor slider is manufactured by a process in which iron having components such as<br>
those described above is subjected to semi-molten or semi-solid die casting and metal-mold<br>
casting, is then rapidly cooled to convert: the entire material to white iron, and is thereafter<br>
heat treated. Therefore, merits and other advantages can be obtained in that thrust loss can<br>
be reduced due to a small diameter, and higher capacity can be obtained by reducing the<br>
thickness of the components, and damage is less likely to occur with regard to inclusion of<br>
foreign matter and a sudden increase in internal pressure because of the higher toughness in<br>
comparison with FC material. Even if damage were to occur, small scrapings are not<br>
produced and pipes do not need to be cleaned. Such a compressor can be regarded to be<br>
suitable in cases in which an upgrade is required.<br>
The compressor slider according to a second aspect is the compressor slider according to the<br>
first aspect, being manufactured by semi-molten die casting or semi-solid die casting, then<br>
 <br>
rapid cooling, and then a heat treatment.<br>
This compressor slider is manufactured by semi-molten die casting or semi-solid die casting,<br>
then rapid cooling, and then a heat treatment. Accordingly, the slider preform can be made<br>
into a near-net shape. Therefore, the compressor slider can reduce machining costs and can<br>
be manufactured at lower cost.<br>
The compressor slider according to a third aspect is the compressor slider according to the<br>
first aspect, being manufactured by metal-mold casting, then rapid cooling, and then a heat<br>
treatment.<br>
This compressor slider is manufactured by metal-mold casting, then rapid cooling, and then a<br>
heat treatment. Accordingly, the pressure required in the molding step can be kept low.<br>
Therefore, a press apparatus or a heating apparatus in die casting is not required, and<br>
equipment costs can be reduced. As a result, the compressor slider reduces molding costs<br>
and can be manufactured at lower cost.<br>
The compressor slider according to a fourth aspect is the compressor slider according to any<br>
of the first to third aspects, wherein the ratio of tensile strength to Young's modulus is 0.0046<br>
or less. Young's modulus is preferably 175 to 190 GPa.<br>
A compressor slider produced by die casting in which a semi-molten (semi-solid) iron<br>
material is pressed into a mold to manufacture a casting is subjected to heat treatment by<br>
being held at a prescribed temperature for a prescribed time, and by having the cooling speed<br>
adjusted, whereby the tensile strength can be improved in comparison with a conventional<br>
material such as FC250.<br>
However, the inventors of the present invention discovered that when the tensile strength is<br>
increased to a level not conventionally done, other problems occur when the ratio (H/T),<br>
which is the ratio of the height (H) to thickness (T) of the scroll portion of the scroll, is<br>
determined based solely on the viewpoint of the strength that would prevent fatigue damage,<br>
as in a conventional manner. In other words, when the ratio (H/T) is made excessively high<br>
because of the strength, drawbacks were noted in that the machining tolerance of end milling<br>
or the like and the cutting speed cannot be increased even when there is no problem in terms<br>
of strength, because the amount of deformation (amount of flexing) of the scroll portion<br>
becomes excessive during cutting, machining time may be extended, the amount of<br>
deformation (amount of flexing) of the scroll portion increases during compressor operation,<br>
performance is reduced, and noise from contact with the counterpart scroll increases.<br>
In view of the above, in the present invention, the ratio of the tensile strength in relation to<br>
Young's modulus of the scroll after heat processing is determined so that costs are not<br>
 <br>
incurred to achieve excessive strength in heat treatment. The determination is based on<br>
research to determine the level of tensile strength that is sufficient from the viewpoint of<br>
fatigue strength. In this determination, the ratio (H/T) of the scroll portion is determined<br>
with consideration given to the required upper limit of the deformation amount of the scroll<br>
portion from the viewpoint of the machining time, performance reduction, and noise.<br>
Specifically, the increase in strength by heat treatment is limited so that the ratio of the tensile<br>
strength in relation to Young's modulus is set to be 0.0046 or less. Since the ratio of the<br>
tensile strength in relation to Young's modulus is determined in this manner, a situation is<br>
avoided in the scroll part according to the present invention in which the scroll portion is<br>
subjected to an excessive increase in strength via heat treatment that involves costs and time,<br>
and the heat treatment can be suitably performed.<br>
It is illogical to conversely extend the heat treatment to keep strength low, and since failure<br>
may occur in that abrasion resistance is reduced when the ferrite ratio of the metal structure is<br>
increased, the ratio of the tensile strength in relation to Young's modulus is preferably kept at<br>
0.0033 or higher.<br>
When such a scroll is incorporated into a scroll compressor that is incorporated into a<br>
refrigerant circuit of a refrigeration apparatus in which R410A is used as a refrigerant, the<br>
value obtained by dividing the length (hereinafter referred to as scroll portion height (H)) in<br>
the direction orthogonal to the flat plate portion of the scroll portion by the thickness<br>
(hereinafter referred to as scroll portion thickness (T)) of the scroll portion is preferably kept<br>
at 19 or less. Also, when such a scroll is incorporated into a scroll compressor that is<br>
incorporated into a refrigerant circuit of a refrigeration apparatus in which carbon dioxide is<br>
used as a refrigerant, the value obtained by dividing the scroll portion height (H) by the scroll<br>
portion thickness (T) is preferably kept at 8 or less. The toughness of the scroll portion<br>
(Young's modulus) becomes insufficient when the scroll portion height (H) is increased with<br>
respect to the scroll portion thickness (T) and the scroll portion is made thinner relative to the<br>
height of the scroll portion. Since molding is carried out by semi-molten or semi-solid die<br>
casting and strength is increased in comparison with the case in which a material such as a<br>
conventional FC250 is used, it is preferred that the ratio (H/T) be 10 or higher to assure a<br>
thinner scroll portion for the case in which such a scroll is incorporated into a scroll<br>
compressor that is incorporated into a refrigerant circuit of a refrigeration apparatus in which<br>
R410A is used as a refrigerant. It is preferred that the ratio (H/T) be 2 or higher to assure a<br>
thinner scroll portion for the case in which such a scroll part is incorporated into a scroll<br>
compressor that is incorporated into a refrigerant circuit of a refrigeration apparatus in which<br>
 <br>
carbon dioxide is used as a refrigerant.<br>
The compressor slider according to a fifth aspect is the compressor slider according to any of<br>
the first to fourth aspects, wherein a portion thereof, e.g., a stress concentration area or a<br>
sliding portion, is treated in partial heat treatment. As used herein, the term "partial heat<br>
treatment" refers to the use of a high-frequency heating method, a laser heating method, or<br>
another method. The eccentric shaft portion and the main shaft portion are preferably<br>
treated in partial heat treatment when the slider is a crankshaft of a compressor incorporated<br>
into a refrigerant circuit of a refrigerant apparatus in which carbon dioxide, R410A, or<br>
another high-pressure refrigerant is used as the refrigerant. When a notched portion is<br>
provided between the main shaft portion and the eccentric shaft portion in the crankshaft, the<br>
peripheral area of the notched portion is preferably treated in partial heat treatment. A<br>
balance weight is preferably integrally formed with the crankshaft. An inner-drive pin shaft<br>
portion is preferably treated in partial heat treatment when the slider is an inner drive-type<br>
movable scroll of a scroll compressor incorporated into the refrigerant circuit of a refrigerant<br>
apparatus in which carbon dioxide, R410A, or another high-pressure refrigerant is used as the<br>
refrigerant. The key portion, which is a slider portion, is preferably treated in partial heat<br>
treatment when the slider is a rotation-preventing member (e.g., an Oldham ring (Oldham<br>
coupling) or the like) of a scroll compressor incorporated into the refrigerant circuit of a<br>
refrigerant apparatus in which carbon dioxide, R410A, or another high-pressure refrigerant is<br>
used as the refrigerant. A wall portion in which a bushing accommodation hole is formed is<br>
preferably treated in partial heat treatment when the slider is a cylinder block of a swing<br>
compressor incorporated into the refrigerant circuit of a refrigerant apparatus in which carbon<br>
dioxide, R410A, or another high-pressure refrigerant is used as the refrigerant. The<br>
peripheral area of the base of the blade portion and the peripheral area of the notched portion<br>
formed in the base of the blade portion are preferably treated in partial heat treatment when<br>
the slider is a piston of a swing compressor incorporated into the refrigerant circuit of a<br>
refrigerant apparatus in which carbon dioxide, R410A, or another high-pressure refrigerant is<br>
used as the refrigerant. A wall portion in which a vane accommodation hole is formed is<br>
preferably treated in partial heat treatment when the slider is a cylinder block of a rotary<br>
compressor incorporated into the refrigerant circuit of a refrigerant apparatus in which carbon<br>
dioxide, R410A, or another high-pressure refrigerant is used as the refrigerant.<br>
This compressor slider has a portion, e.g., a stress concentration area, a sliding portion, or the<br>
like, that is treated in partial heat treatment. Accordingly, sufficient fatigue strength and<br>
abrasion resistance can be imparted to the stress concentration area, sliding portion, or the<br>
 <br>
like of the compressor slider. Such a slider is particularly effective in relation to a<br>
high-pressure refrigerant, e.g., carbon dioxide or the like. Since the strength of the partially<br>
heat-treated portions is increased, the partially heat-treated portions can be made thinner and<br>
more lightweight.<br>
The compressor slider according to a sixth aspect is the compressor slider according to the<br>
fifth aspect, wherein the hardness of a location that is treated in partial heat treatment is<br>
greater than HRC 50 but less than HRC 65.<br>
With this compressor slider, the hardness of a location that is treated in partial heat treatment<br>
is greater than HRC 50 but less than HRC 65. Accordingly, abrasion in such a portion can<br>
be sufficiently reduced by setting the hardness of this portion to be greater than HRC 50 but<br>
less than HRC 65 when, e.g., a bearing portion or other portion having particular hardness<br>
requirements is present in the compressor slider.<br>
The compressor slider according to a seventh aspect is the compressor slider according to the<br>
fifth or sixth aspect, wherein a location that is treated in partial heat treatment is a stress<br>
concentration area. As used herein, the term "stress concentration area" refers to a<br>
peripheral area of the base of a scroll portion of the scroll, a notched area formed in the<br>
vicinity of the center of the first plate surface side of the flat plate portion of the scroll, a<br>
peripheral area of the base of the bearing portion of the scroll, or another area.<br>
The stress concentration area of this compressor slider is treated in partial heat treatment.<br>
Accordingly, in this compressor slider, good breaking-in characteristics are imparted to the<br>
sliders that require slidability, and sufficient fatigue strength is imparted to the stress<br>
concentration area. Such a slider is particularly effective in relation to high-pressure<br>
refrigerant, e.g., carbon dioxide and the like.<br>
The compressor slider according to an eighth aspect is the compressor slider according to any<br>
of the first to seventh aspects, being manufactured using a mold having a convexity. The<br>
convexity allows a prescribed portion in the vicinity of a center of the slider to be thinly<br>
formed. The slider is provided with a thin prescribed portion in the vicinity of the center.<br>
As used herein, the term "prescribed portion" is, e.g., an opening formation portion or the like.<br>
When the compressor slider is a scroll part, the "prescribed portion" is, e.g., a portion in the<br>
vicinity of the center of the end plate, a portion in which a discharge hole is to be formed in<br>
the vicinity of the center, or another portion. In this case, the height of the convexity is<br>
preferably set so that the thickness of the prescribed portion in the vicinity of the center of the<br>
scroll is 4 mm or less. When the slider is a movable scroll, a movable scroll having a<br>
bearing portion that fits onto the outside of a drive shaft reduces the generation of blowholes<br>
 <br>
to a greater extent than does a movable scroll of an inner drive in which the bearing portion<br>
of a solid rounded rod fits inside the drive shaft. When the slider is a movable scroll of an<br>
inner drive in which the bearing portion of a solid rounded rod fits inside the drive shaft, it is<br>
preferred that at least a portion of the interior of the bearing portion is cored by using the<br>
convexity.<br>
In semi-molten molding, a semi-molten metal material is molded in a mold. Accordingly,<br>
there is a problem in that blowholes will readily occur in the thick portions of a molded slider.<br>
When a hole is furthermore formed in the preform in a state in which blowholes are present<br>
inside the molded slider preform, the blowholes inside the preform tend to be exposed to the<br>
exterior through the holed portion. When blowholes are exposed on an external surface of the<br>
slider, the portion of the exposed blowhole readily becomes a source for fatigue failure of a<br>
slider and is likely to have an undesirable affect on fatigue strength.<br>
In response to such a problem, in the present invention, a thin prescribed portion is formed in<br>
the vicinity of the center of the slider by subjecting a metal material to semi-molten molding<br>
using a mold having a convexity. For this reason, the occurrence of blowholes is reduced in<br>
this compressor slider.<br>
The compressor slider according to a ninth aspect is the compressor slider according to any of<br>
the first to seventh aspects, wherein a slider preform provided with a thin prescribed portion<br>
in the vicinity of a center is molded using a mold having a convexity that allows a prescribed<br>
portion in the vicinity of the center to be thinly formed, and a through-hole is formed in the<br>
thin prescribed portion in the preform. As used herein, the term "prescribed portion" is, e.g.,<br>
an opening formation portion or the like. When the compressor slider is a scroll part, the<br>
"prescribed portion" is, e.g., a portion in the vicinity of the center of the end plate, a portion<br>
in which a discharge hole is to be formed in the vicinity of the center, or another portion. In<br>
this case, the height of the convexity is preferably set so that the thickness of the prescribed<br>
portion in the vicinity of the center of the scroll is 4 mm or less. When the slider is a<br>
movable scroll, a movable scroll having a bearing portion that fits onto the outside of a drive<br>
shaft reduces the generation of blowholes to a greater extent than does a movable scroll part<br>
of an inner drive in which the bearing portion of a solid rounded rod fits inside the drive shaft.<br>
When the slider is a movable scroll of an inner drive in which the bearing portion, of a solid<br>
rounded rod fits inside the drive shaft, it is preferred that at least a portion of the interior of<br>
the bearing portion be cored using the convexity.<br>
This compressor slider is manufactured by molding a preform having a thin prescribed<br>
portion in the vicinity of the center with the aid of a mold having a convexity, and by forming<br>
 <br>
a through-hole in the thin prescribed portion in the preform.. For this reason, the occurrence<br>
of blowholes is reduced in the compressor slider. Blowholes inside a slider are unlikely to<br>
become exposed to the exterior when a through-hole is formed in the opening formation<br>
portion, and degradation in fatigue strength can be reduced.<br>
The compressor scroll according to a tenth aspect has a carbon content of 2.0 wt% to 2.7 wt%,<br>
a silicon content of 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt%, a balance of iron that includes unavoidable<br>
impurities, graphite that is smaller than the flake graphite of flake graphite cast iron, the<br>
compressor scroll comprising a plate portion and a scroll portion. The scroll portion extends<br>
from a first plate surface of the plate portion in a direction perpendicular to the first plate<br>
surface while a scroll shape is maintained. The plate portion and the scroll portion have a<br>
hardness that is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. It is particularly preferred that<br>
the hardness of the scroll portion at a distal end thereof be included in the hardness ranged<br>
noted above. It is preferred that the hardness be greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 95.<br>
A range in which the hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 substantially<br>
corresponds to a range in which the ferrite surface area ratio of the base composition is from<br>
50% to 5%. The graphite surface area ratio of the base composition substantially<br>
corresponds to a range from 6% to 2%. The range in which the hardness is greater than<br>
HRB 90 but less than HRB 95 substantially corresponds to a range in which the ferrite<br>
surface area ratio of the base composition is less than 50% and greater than 25%. The<br>
graphite surface area ratio of the base composition substantially corresponds to a range that is<br>
less than 6% and greater than 3%. The hardness can be adjusted by a heating treatment that<br>
follows molding. It is preferred that the scroll portion have a height, as measured from the<br>
first plate surface, that is twice the width or less of the groove (trough portion) of the scroll<br>
portion. This is because machining can be relatively easily performed even if the<br>
pre-machining tolerance is high.<br>
The compressor scroll is manufactured by performing the semi-molten or semi-solid die<br>
casting and metal-mold casting of an iron material having the above-described components,<br>
then rapidly cooling the molded material to convert the entire material to white iron, and then<br>
performing a heat treatment. Accordingly, the tensile strength of the scroll portion can be<br>
sufficiently improved. Therefore, the freedom to design the scroll portion is considerably<br>
improved and the scroll portion can be made smaller and given greater capacity. Based on<br>
experimental results obtained by the present inventor, it is apparent that when the hardness is<br>
in a range that is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100, the scroll can demonstrate<br>
sufficient durability during compressor operation, "breaking-in" can occur as soon as possible,<br>
 <br>
and seizing during abnormal operation does not occur. For this reason, the compressor<br>
scroll has high tensile strength, demonstrates sufficient durability during operation, can be<br>
"broken in" as early as possible, and does not undergo seizing during abnormal operation.<br>
The compressor scroll according to an eleventh aspect is the compressor scroll according to<br>
the tenth aspect, wherein a draft angle of the scroll portion in relation to a mold varies in<br>
accordance with a winding angle.<br>
Since a wrap draft angle is not provided or is constant in a conventional scroll, there is a<br>
problem in that the wrap shape is not determined in accordance with strength and quality, and<br>
material is wasted during the manufacture of the scroll. Also, when the shape of the scroll is<br>
considered, the mold is readily affected by stress when the scroll is separated from the mold<br>
because the radius of curvature of the wrap is reduced in progression toward the center<br>
portion of the scroll wrap. Accordingly, it is difficult to extend the service life of the mold.<br>
In view of this problem, the draft angle in relation to the mold varies in accordance with the<br>
winding angle of the scroll portion in the scroll according to the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, with this scroll, the shape of the scroll portion is determined in accordance with<br>
strength and quality, and wasted material can be eliminated.<br>
The compressor scroll according to a twelfth aspect is the compressor scroll part according to<br>
the eleventh aspect, wherein the scroll portion presents a scroll shape in which a draft angle<br>
in relation to the mold in the portion where winding starts near a center is larger than the draft<br>
angle of an outside portion where winding ends. The scroll portion is preferably set so that<br>
the draft angle continuously and gradually changes from where winding starts to where<br>
winding ends. The stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of the scroll during<br>
mold release is reduced, the service life of the mold can be extended, and wasted material can<br>
be more effectively eliminated. The scroll portion is also preferably set so that a draft angle<br>
changes in a stepwise fashion from where winding starts to where winding ends. The stress<br>
applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of the scroll during mold release is reduced,<br>
the service life of the mold can be extended, the draft angle in each of the angle ranges of the<br>
scroll portion can be set in a simple manner, and wasted material can be more effectively<br>
eliminated. The scroll portion is preferably set so that the draft angle in a prescribed angle<br>
range between where winding starts and where winding ends is greater than the draft angle in<br>
other angle ranges. This is because the stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the<br>
center of the scroll during mold release is reduced, the service life of the mold can be<br>
extended, adverse effect in relation to near-net shaping in the scroll portion overall can be<br>
further reduced, and wasted material can be more effectively eliminated. It is preferred that<br>
 <br>
at least the scroll portion be coated with resin in this scroll. This is because a coated resin is<br>
more easily machined than when a molded member is machined directly, machining precision<br>
can be improved, leakage of compressed medium can be reduced by filling the gaps, and<br>
noise can be reduced due to the elasticity of the resin when scroll portions make contact with<br>
each other.<br>
With this scroll, the draft angle in the portion where winding starts near the center of the<br>
scroll portion is greater than the draft angle of the portion where winding ends at the outer<br>
side. Accordingly, the stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of the scroll<br>
can be reduced during mold release in which the scroll is released from the mold. As a<br>
result, the service life of the mold can be extended.<br>
The compressor scroll part according to a thirteenth aspect is the compressor scroll part<br>
according to the eleventh aspect, wherein the scroll portion presents a scroll shape in which a<br>
draft angle in relation to the mold in the portion where winding ends at the outer side is larger<br>
than a draft angle of the portion where winding starts near the center. The scroll portion is<br>
preferably set so that the draft angle continuously and gradually changes from where winding<br>
starts to where winding ends. The stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of<br>
the spiral during mold release is reduced, the service life of the mold can be extended, and<br>
wasted material can be more effectively eliminated. The scroll portion is also preferably set<br>
so that a draft angle changes in a stepwise fashion from where winding starts to where<br>
winding ends. The stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of the scroll during<br>
mold release is reduced, the service life of the mold can be extended, the draft angle in each<br>
of the angle ranges of the scroll portion can be set in a simple manner, and wasted material<br>
can be more effectively eliminated. The scroll portion is preferably set so that the draft<br>
angle in a prescribed angle range between where winding starts and where winding ends is<br>
greater than the draft angle in other angle ranges. This is because the stress applied to the<br>
mold in the vicinity of the center of the scroll during mold release is reduced, the service life<br>
of the mold can be extended, any adverse effect in relation to near-net shaping in the scroll<br>
portion overall can be further reduced, and wasted material can be more effectively<br>
eliminated. It is preferred that at least the scroll portion be coated with resin in this scroll<br>
part. This is because leakage of a compressed medium can be reduced, and noise can also<br>
be reduced.<br>
With this scroll, the draft angle in the portion where winding ends at the outer side of the<br>
scroll portion is greater than the draft angle of the portion where winding begins near the<br>
center. Accordingly, the external peripheral portion of the scroll portion is thin. Therefore,<br>
 <br>
this configuration is effective for cases in which it is difficult to achieve machining precision,<br>
and the precision in the external peripheral portion of the scroll portion can be assured even<br>
when the thickness of the scroll portion is reduced.<br>
The compressor scroll part according to a fourteenth aspect is the compressor scroll part<br>
according to the tenth aspect, wherein the scroll portion has a first surface that slopes at a first<br>
angle with respect to a line that is orthogonal to the flat surface portion, the first surface being<br>
positioned on the internal peripheral side of the portion in the vicinity of the start of winding<br>
near the center. A surface other than the first surface of the scroll portion has a slope angle<br>
in relation to the line orthogonal to the flat plate portion that is less than the first angle. The<br>
first surface of the scroll portion preferably is a surface that is not in contact with a<br>
counterpart scroll that meshes in the relative movement of the fixed scroll and the movable<br>
scroll. This is because the use of a large slope is ordinarily disadvantageous from the point<br>
of managing surface precision, but since the surface (first surface) is not a surface that makes<br>
contact with a counterpart scroll and affects the airtightness of the compression chamber,<br>
there are no demerits. A surface (the surface that makes contact with a meshing counterpart<br>
scroll and affects the level of airtightness of the compression chamber) other than the first<br>
surface of the scroll portion preferably has a slope angle in relation to the line orthogonal to<br>
the flat plate portion that is essentially 0°. This is because the surface precision of the scroll<br>
can be kept high, and malfunctions are reduced in which gas refrigerant leaks from the<br>
meshing portion of the two scrolls to an adjacent chamber during operation of the scroll<br>
compressor.<br>
In the portion adjacent to where winding starts in the scroll portion, in which the received<br>
pressure near the center is increased, a first surface on the internal peripheral side is sloped at<br>
a first angle to reliably assure increased strength and less deformation. On the other hand,<br>
the portion set at a distance from the center of the scroll portion has a slope angle that is less<br>
than the first angle, and a considerable reduction in capacity is avoided. The external<br>
peripheral surface of the scroll portion adjacent to where the winding starts is a surface that<br>
makes contact with the counterpart scroll and performs compression work. When a large<br>
slope is used, it is difficult to control the surface precision of the sloped surface, i.e., the<br>
precision of the profile shape at each height from the flat plate portion of the scroll portion<br>
and the precision of the rounded shape along the boundary between the scroll portion and the<br>
flat plate portion; and since refrigerant gas leakage is likely to increase in the contact portions<br>
of the two scrolls, the slope angle is set to be less than the first angle.<br>
In this manner, with a scroll compressor in which the scroll of the present invention is<br>
 <br>
adopted, the slope angle is reduced with priority given to increasing the capacity rather than<br>
strength and the amount of deformation because pressure is relatively low in portions other<br>
than the portion of the scroll portion adjacent to where the winding starts. In the first<br>
surface on the internal peripheral side of the portion of the scroll portion adjacent to where<br>
the winding starts, the slope angle is increased with priority given to increasing strength and<br>
reducing the amount of deformation because pressure is relatively high. In the external<br>
peripheral surface of the portion of the scroll portion that is adjacent to where winding starts,<br>
the slope angle is reduced with consideration given to surface precision control and the<br>
airtightness of the compression chamber. Accordingly, it can be assured that the thickness<br>
of the scroll portion overall is reduced and capacity is increased. On the other hand, in the<br>
portion of the high-pressure scroll portion that is adjacent to where winding starts, a slope<br>
having a first angle is used, whereby strength can be assured and the amount of deformation<br>
can be reduced to an acceptable level.<br>
Another advantage is that, in portions other than the portion of the scroll portion that is<br>
adjacent to where winding starts, the slope angle is reduced and surface precision control and<br>
the airtightness of the compression chamber can be assured.<br>
In a compressor for compressing carbon dioxide or another high-pressure refrigerant, the<br>
strength must be increased in the center portion of the scroll, where stress is concentrated in<br>
the scroll. With the scroll according to the present invention, the first surface positioned on<br>
the internal peripheral side of the portion adjacent to where winding starts near the center is<br>
sloped by a first angle (9) with respect to the line orthogonal to the flat plate portion. For<br>
this reason, strength in the center portion of the spiral is increased in this scroll part.<br>
Therefore, in a scroll compressor in which such a scroll part has been incorporated, the slider<br>
can withstand an increase in pressure due to high pressure differences when carbon dioxide or<br>
another high-pressure refrigerant is compressed. This effect allows the height of the teeth of<br>
the scroll to be increased. In other words, the capacity of the compression chamber can be<br>
increased while the diameter of the scroll portion is reduced. When the diameter of the<br>
scroll compressor is reduced by reducing the diameter of the scroll, the diameter of the trunk<br>
portion of the casing is reduced. When the diameter of the trunk portion of the casing is<br>
reduced, the casing can exhibit the same compression strength at the thinner thickness, in<br>
comparison with a conventional casing. Accordingly, the raw material costs and the like of<br>
the casing can be reduced. When the diameter of the scroll is reduced, the scroll portion is<br>
reduced in size and the sliding surface area of the thrust portion, which is subject to rigorous<br>
conditions, can be increased. When such a scroll is molded by semi-molten die casting or<br>
 <br>
the like, the scroll has a surface roughness that is reduced to less than that obtained using<br>
conventional casting. For this reason, with a scroll compressor in which such a scroll part<br>
has been incorporated, cracks are not likely to occur in the surface of the scroll even when<br>
carbon dioxide or another high-pressure refrigerant is compressed. Even when the scroll is<br>
an unfinished article, such damage is less likely to occur. The volume circulation rate of<br>
carbon dioxide is low. Accordingly, with a compressor for compressing carbon dioxide or<br>
another high-pressure refrigerant, the diameter of the discharge port may be less than that of a<br>
conventional article. Therefore, the space between the discharge port and the scroll wall<br>
surface can be increased in size. Accordingly, the slope angle 9 of the first surface can be<br>
increased, and the strength of the center portion of the scroll can be further enhanced. As a<br>
result, a greater effect can be obtained in a scroll compressor in which such a scroll part is<br>
incorporated.<br>
The compressor scroll part according to a fifteenth aspect is the compressor scroll part<br>
according to the fourteenth aspect, wherein the portion of the scroll portion near where<br>
winding starts has a thickness at the boundary with the flat portion that is greater than in other<br>
portions of the scroll portion.<br>
The compressor slider preform according to a sixteenth aspect has a carbon content of 2.0<br>
wt% to 2.7 wt%, a silicon content of 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt%, a balance of iron that includes<br>
unavoidable impurities, graphite that is smaller than the flake graphite of flake graphite cast<br>
iron, and a hardness that is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 in at least a portion of<br>
the slider preform. The hardness is more preferably greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB<br>
95. As used herein, the term "slider preform" refers to a yet unmachined precursor or the<br>
like to obtain a completing slider. When the hardness of the slider preform is HRB 90 or<br>
less, a built-up edge is readily formed when the slider preform is machined, and grinding<br>
processability is likely to be degraded. On the other hand, when the hardness of the slider<br>
preform is HRB 100 or greater, machining costs tend to increase because tool abrasion,<br>
chipping, and the like readily occur in the machining of the slider preform, and machining<br>
costs also tend to increase due to higher cutting resistance and limitations in the cutting depth<br>
and machining speed. The range in which the hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less than<br>
HRB 100 substantially corresponds to the range in which a ferrite surface area ratio of the<br>
base composition is from 50% to 5%. The graphite surface area ratio of the base<br>
composition substantially corresponds to a range from 6% to 2%. The range in which the<br>
hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 95 substantially corresponds to the range<br>
in which the ferrite surface area ratio of the base composition is less than 50% and greater<br>
 <br>
than 25%. The graphite surface area ratio of the base composition substantially corresponds<br>
to a range that is less than 6% and greater than 3%.<br>
The tensile strength can be freely adjusted by heat-treating a molded article obtained by<br>
subjecting iron having the components described above to semi-molten or semi-solid die<br>
casting and metal-mold casting, and thereafter rapidly cooling the molded material to convert<br>
the entire material to white iron. It has been made apparent that the tensile strength of a<br>
molded article manufactured via the heat treatment is in a proportional relationship with the<br>
hardness of the molded article. The range in which the hardness is greater than HRB 90 but<br>
less than HRB 100 substantially corresponds to a range in which the tensile strength is from<br>
600 MPa to 900 MPa. In other words, control of the tensile strength of the molded article<br>
can be substituted with the hardness, which is easy to measure. Another merit is that when<br>
the slider preform is a scroll part preform, the freedom of designing the scroll portion is<br>
considerably expanded to allow a smaller diameter or greater capacity to be achieved.<br>
Therefore, the compressor slider preform demonstrates higher tensile strength than a slider<br>
preform composed of flake graphite cast iron. Based on experimental results obtained by<br>
the present inventor, it is apparent that when the hardness of the slider preform is in a range<br>
that is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100, good machinability is exhibited for the<br>
case in which the slider is manufactured by a process in which iron having components such<br>
as those described above is subjected to semi-molten or semi-solid die casting and<br>
metal-mold casting, is then rapidly cooled to convert the entire material to white iron, and is<br>
thereafter heat treated. Still another merit is that good machinability reduces the likelihood<br>
of tool abrasion and tool chipping, extends tool service life, makes it less likely that a built-up<br>
edge will form, facilitates grinding, and reduces machining costs because machining time can<br>
be reduced. Yet another merit is that since the slider preform exhibits suitable hardness, the<br>
slider preform is less likely to be damaged and handling is facilitated. It should also be<br>
noted that even though the slider preform has good characteristics in terms of tool abrasion<br>
and machining time, because the slider preform has lower hardness in comparison with FCD<br>
having the same tensile strength (tensile strength is high at the same level of hardness), the<br>
preform also has higher tensile strength than a conventional preform. When the slider<br>
preform is cut, a counterpart slider (Oldham ring, seal, and the like in the case that the slider<br>
is a movable scroll) is not damaged because the surface roughness is more easily reduced in<br>
comparison with an FC material. In summary of the above, this compressor slider preform<br>
has high tensile strength and exhibits good machinability when machining is required.<br>
The compressor according to a seventeenth aspect comprises a slider having a carbon content<br>
 <br>
of 2.0 wt% to 2.7 wt%, a silicon content of 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt%, a balance of iron that<br>
includes unavoidable impurities, graphite that is smaller than the flake graphite of flake<br>
graphite cast iron, and a hardness that is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 in at<br>
least a portion of the slider. As used herein, the phrase "compressor" refers to, e.g., a scroll<br>
compressor, a swing compressor, a rotary compressor, or the like. It is preferred that the<br>
hardness be greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 95. A range in which the hardness is<br>
greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 substantially corresponds to a range in which the<br>
ferrite surface area ratio of the base composition is from 50% to 5%. The graphite surface<br>
area ratio of the base composition substantially corresponds to a range from 6% to 2%. The<br>
range in which the hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 95 substantially<br>
corresponds to a range in which the ferrite surface area ratio of the base composition is less<br>
than 50% and greater than 25%. The graphite surface area ratio of the base composition<br>
substantially corresponds to a range that is less than 6% and greater than 3%. The hardness<br>
can be adjusted by a heating treatment that follows molding.<br>
The tensile strength of a molded article can be freely adjusted by heat treatment for a molded<br>
article obtained by subjecting iron having the components described above to semi-molten or<br>
semi-solid die casting and metal-mold casting, and thereafter rapidly cooling the molded<br>
material to convert the entire material to white iron. It has been made apparent that the<br>
tensile strength of a molded article manufactured via the heat treatment is in a proportional<br>
relationship with the hardness of the molded article. The range in which the hardness is<br>
greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 substantially corresponds to a range in which the<br>
tensile strength is from 600 MPa to 900 MPa. In other words, control of the tensile strength<br>
of the molded article can be substituted with control of the hardness, which is easy to<br>
measure. Another merit is that when the slider is a scroll, the freedom of designing the<br>
scroll portion is considerably expanded to allow a smaller diameter or greater capacity to be<br>
achieved. Therefore, the compressor slider demonstrates higher tensile strength than a slider<br>
composed of flake graphite cast iron. Based on experimental results obtained by the present<br>
inventor, it is apparent that when the hardness is in a range that is greater than HRB 90 but<br>
less than HRB 100, the slider can demonstrate sufficient durability during compressor<br>
operation, "breaking-in" can occur as soon as possible, and seizing during abnormal operation<br>
does not occur. Accordingly, in this compressor, tensile strength is high, sufficient<br>
durability is demonstrated during compressor operation, "breaking-in" can occur as soon as<br>
possible, and seizing during abnormal operation can be prevented. In this compressor, the<br>
slider has a carbon content of 2.0 wt% to 2.7 wt%, a silicon content of 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt%, a<br>
 <br>
balance of iron that includes unavoidable impurities, and graphite that is smaller than the<br>
flake graphite of flake graphite cast iron. Therefore, merits and other advantages can be<br>
obtained in that thrust loss can be reduced due to a smaller diameter, and higher capacity<br>
obtained by reducing the thickness of the components, and damage is less likely to occur with<br>
regard to inclusion of foreign matter and a sudden increase in internal pressure because of the<br>
higher toughness in comparison with FC material. Even if damage were to occur, small<br>
scrapings are not produced and pipes do not need to be cleaned. Such a compressor can be<br>
regarded to be suitable in cases in which an upgrade is required.<br>
The compressor according to an eighteenth aspect is the compressor according to the<br>
seventeenth aspect, and is capable of accommodating a carbon dioxide (CO2) refrigerant.<br>
This compressor is capable of accommodating a carbon dioxide (CO2) refrigerant.<br>
Accordingly, the compressor can contribute to global environmental problems.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compressor slider according to the first aspect has high tensile strength, demonstrates<br>
sufficient durability during operation, can be "broken in" as early as possible, and does not<br>
undergo seizing during abnormal operation. This compressor slider has a carbon content of<br>
2.0 wt% to 2.7 wt%, a silicon content of 1.0 wt% to 3.0 wt%, a balance of iron that includes<br>
unavoidable impurities, and graphite that is smaller than the flake graphite of flake graphite<br>
cast iron. Therefore, merits and other advantages can be obtained in that thrust loss can be<br>
reduced due to a smaller diameter, and higher capacity obtained by reducing the thickness of<br>
the components, and damage is less likely to occur with regard to inclusion of foreign matter<br>
and a sudden increase in internal pressure because of the higher toughness in comparison<br>
with FC material. Even if damage were to occur, small scrapings are not produced and<br>
pipes do not need to be cleaned. Such a compressor can be regarded to be suitable in cases<br>
in which an upgrade is required.<br>
The compressor slider according to the second aspect is one in which a slider preform can be<br>
made into a near-net shape. Therefore, the compressor slider can reduce machining costs<br>
and can be manufactured at lower cost.<br>
The compressor slider according to the third aspect is one in which the pressure required<br>
during the molding step is reduced. Therefore, a press apparatus or a heating apparatus in<br>
die casting is not required, and equipment costs can be reduced. As a result, the compressor<br>
slider reduces molding costs and can be manufactured at lower cost.<br>
In the fourth aspect, when the compressor slider is a scroll part, the ratio of the tensile<br>
strength in relation to Young's modulus of the scroll part after heat processing is determined<br>
 <br>
so that costs are not incurred to achieve excessive strength in heat treatment. The<br>
determination is based on research to determine the level of tensile strength that is sufficient<br>
from the viewpoint of fatigue strength. In this determination, the ratio (H/T) of the scroll<br>
portion is determined with consideration given to the required upper limit of the deformation<br>
amount of the scroll portion from the viewpoint of the machining time, performance<br>
reduction, and noise. Specifically, the increase in strength by heat treatment is limited so<br>
that the ratio of the tensile strength in relation to Young's modulus is set to be 0.0046 or less.<br>
Since the ratio of the tensile strength in relation to Young's modulus is determined in this<br>
manner, a situation is avoided in which the scroll portion in the scroll according to the present<br>
invention is subjected to an excessive increase in strength via a heat treatment that involves<br>
costs and time, and the heat treatment can be suitably performed.<br>
In the compressor slider according to the fifth aspect, sufficient fatigue strength and abrasion<br>
resistance can be imparted to a stress concentration area, sliding portion, or the like. Since<br>
the strength of the partially heat-treated portions is increased, the partially heat-treated<br>
portions can be made thinner and more lightweight.<br>
In the compressor slider according to the sixth aspect, in the case a bearing portion or another<br>
portion that requires hardness in particular exists, abrasion in this portion can be sufficiently<br>
reduced by setting the hardness of the portion to be greater than HRC 50 but less than HRC<br>
65.<br>
The compressor slider according to the seventh aspect is one in which good breaking-in<br>
characteristics are imparted to the slider area that require slidability, and sufficient fatigue<br>
strength is imparted to the stress concentration area.<br>
In the compressor slider according to the eighth aspect, the occurrence of blowholes is<br>
reduced.<br>
In the compressor slider according to the ninth aspect, the occurrence of blowholes is reduced.<br>
Also, blowholes inside a slider are unlikely to become exposed to the exterior when a<br>
through-hole is formed in the opening formation portion, and degradation in fatigue strength<br>
can be reduced.<br>
The compressor scroll part according to the tenth aspect has high tensile strength,<br>
demonstrates sufficient durability during operation, can be "broken in" as early as possible,<br>
and does not undergo seizing during abnormal operation.<br>
In the compressor scroll part according to the eleventh aspect, the shape of the scroll portion<br>
is determined in accordance with strength and quality, and wasted material can be eliminated.<br>
In accordance with the twelfth aspect, stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center<br>
 <br>
of the scroll can be reduced during mold release in which the scroll is released from the mold.<br>
As a result, the service life of the mold can be extended.<br>
In accordance with the thirteenth aspect, the precision in the external peripheral portion of the<br>
scroll portion can be assured even when the thickness of the scroll portion is reduced.<br>
In the scroll and the scroll compressor provided with the scroll according to the fourteenth<br>
and fifteenth aspects, the slope angle is reduced with priority given to increasing the capacity<br>
rather than strength and the amount of deformation of the scroll portion because pressure is<br>
relatively low in portions other than the portion of the scroll portion adjacent to where the<br>
winding starts. In the first internal peripheral surface of the portion of the scroll portion<br>
adjacent to where the winding starts, the slope angle is increased with priority given to<br>
increasing strength and reducing the amount of deformation because pressure is relatively<br>
high. In the external peripheral surface of the portion of the s scroll portion that is adjacent<br>
to where winding starts, the slope angle is reduced with consideration given to surface<br>
precision control and the airtightness of the compression chamber. It can be assured that the<br>
thickness of the scroll portion overall is reduced and capacity is increased. On the other<br>
hand, in the portion of the high-pressure scroll portion that is adjacent to where winding starts,<br>
a slope having a first angle is used, whereby strength can be assured and the amount of<br>
deformation can be reduced to an acceptable level.<br>
The compressor slider preform according to the sixteenth aspect has high tensile strength and<br>
exhibits good machinability when machining is required.<br>
In the compressor according to the seventeenth aspect, a slider is used that has higher tensile<br>
strength than a slider composed of flake graphite cast iron. Based on experimental results<br>
obtained by the present inventor, it is apparent that when the hardness is in a range that is<br>
greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100, the slider can demonstrate sufficient durability<br>
during compressor operation, "breaking-in" can occur as soon as possible, and seizing during<br>
abnormal operation does not occur. Accordingly, in this compressor, tensile strength is high,<br>
sufficient durability is demonstrated during compressor operation, "breaking-in" can occur as<br>
soon as possible, and seizing during abnormal operation can be prevented. In this<br>
compressor, the slider has a carbon content of 2.0 wt% to 2.7 wt%, a silicon content of 1.0<br>
wt% to 3.0 wt%, a balance composed of iron having unavoidable impurities, and graphite that<br>
is smaller than the flake graphite of flake graphite cast iron. Therefore, merits and other<br>
advantages can be obtained in that thrust loss can be reduced due to a smaller diameter, and<br>
higher capacity obtained by reducing the thickness of the components, and damage is less<br>
likely to occur with regard to inclusion of foreign matter and a sudden increase in internal<br>
 <br>
pressure because of the higher toughness in comparison with FC material. Even if damage<br>
were to occur, small scrapings are not produced and pipes do not need to be cleaned.<br>
The compressor according to the eighteenth aspect can contribute to global environmental<br>
problems.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
First embodiment<br>
A compressor in which the slider according to a first embodiment is used will be<br>
described using a high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor as an example. The<br>
high-low pressure dome-type compressor of the first embodiment is designed so as to be<br>
capable of withstanding carbon dioxide refrigerant (CO2), R410A, or another high-pressure<br>
refrigerant.<br>
The high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 according to the first<br>
embodiment constitutes a refrigerant circuit together with an evaporator, a condenser, an<br>
expansion mechanism, and the like; acts to compress a gas refrigerant in the refrigerant<br>
circuit; and is primarily composed of a hermitically sealed cylindrical dome-type casing 10, a<br>
 <br>
scroll compression mechanism 15, an Oldham ring 39, a drive motor 16, a lower main<br>
bearing 60, a suction tube 19, and a discharge tube 20, as shown in FIG. 1. The constituent<br>
elements of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 will be described in detail<br>
below.<br>
(Details of the constituent elements of a high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor)<br>
(1)	Casing<br>
The casing 10 primarily has a substantially cylindrical trunk casing 11, a<br>
saucer-shaped upper wall portion 12 welded in an airtight manner to an upper end of the<br>
trunk casing 11, and a saucer-shaped lower wall portion 13 welded in an airtight manner to a<br>
lower end of the trunk casing 11. Primarily accommodated in the casing 10 are the scroll<br>
compression mechanism 15 for compressing gas refrigerant, and the drive motor 16 disposed<br>
below the scroll compression mechanism 15. The scroll compression mechanism 15 and the<br>
drive motor 16 are connected by a crankshaft 17 disposed so as to extend in the vertical<br>
direction inside the casing 10. As a result, a clearance space 18 is formed between the scroll<br>
compression mechanism 15 and the drive motor 16.<br>
(2)	Scroll compression mechanism<br>
The scroll compression mechanism 15 is primarily composed of a housing 23, a<br>
fixed scroll 24 provided in close contact above the housing 23, and a movable scroll 26 for<br>
meshing with the fixed scroll 24, as shown in FIG. 1. The constituent elements of the scroll<br>
compression mechanism 15 will be described in detail below,<br>
a) Housing<br>
The housing 23 is press-fitted and secured to the trunk casing 11 in peripheral<br>
direction across the entire external peripheral surface of the housing. In other words, the<br>
trunk casing 11 and the housing 23 are in kept close contact in an airtight manner across the<br>
entire periphery. For this reason, the interior of the casing 10 is partitioned into a<br>
high-pressure space 28 below the housing 23, and a low-pressure space 29 above the housing<br>
23. Also, the fixed scroll 24 is fixedly fastened by a bolt 38 to the housing 23 so that the<br>
upper end surface of the housing 23 is in close contact with the lower end surface of the fixed<br>
scroll 24. A housing concavity 31 concavely disposed in the center of the upper surface of<br>
the housing 23, and a bearing portion 32 that extends downward from the center of the lower<br>
surface of the housing 23, are formed in the housing 23. A bearing hole 33 that passes<br>
through in the vertical direction is formed in the bearing portion 32, and a main shaft portion<br>
17b of the crankshaft 17 is rotatably fitted to the bearing hole 33 via the a shaft bearing 34.<br>
In the first embodiment, the housing 23 is manufactured using a novel and special<br>
 <br>
manufacturing method. The manufacturing method is described in detail below in the<br>
section titled "Method for manufacturing a slider."<br>
b)	Fixed scroll<br>
The fixed scroll 24 is primarily composed of an end plate 24a and a scroll (involute<br>
shape) wrap 24b that extends downward from the lower surface 24P of the end plate 24a, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 1 to 3. A discharge hole 41 that is in communication with a later-described<br>
compression chamber 40, and an enlarged concave portion 42 that is in communication with<br>
the discharge hole 41, are formed in the end plate 24a. The discharge hole 41 is formed so<br>
as to extend in the vertical direction in the center portion of the end plate 24a. The enlarged<br>
concave portion 42 is a concavity that is formed so as to widen in the horizontal direction on<br>
the upper surface of the end plate 24a. An opening formation area P (see FIG. 9) provided<br>
with the discharge hole 41 is thinly formed in advance in the fixed scroll 24, as shown in the<br>
manufacturing method described below, whereby the generation of blowholes CN (see FIG.<br>
9) is reduced. The ratio of the height of the wrap 24b in relation to the thickness of wrap<br>
24b is 15 or more. The angle portion and the corner portion of the wrap 24b have a rounded<br>
shape that fits into the angle portion and corner portion of the wrap 26b of the movable scroll.<br>
A lid body 44 is fixedly fastened with a bolt 44a to the upper surface of the fixed<br>
scroll 24 so as to straddle the enlarged concave portion 42. A muffler space 45 for muffling<br>
the operating noise of the scroll compression mechanism 15 is formed by covering the<br>
enlarged concave portion 42 with a lid body 44. The fixed scroll 24 and the lid body 44 are<br>
sealed by close contact via packing, which is not depicted.<br>
In the first embodiment, the fixed scroll 24 is manufactured using a novel and<br>
special manufacturing method. The manufacturing method is described in detail below in<br>
the section titled "Method for manufacturing a slider."<br>
c)	Movable scroll<br>
The movable scroll 26 is an outer drive-type movable scroll and is primarily composed of an<br>
end plate 26a, a scroll (involute shape) wrap 26b that extends upward from the end surface<br>
26P of the end plate 26a, a bearing portion 26c that extends downward from the lower surface<br>
of the end plate 26a and is fitted to the outer side of the crankshaft 17, and a groove portion<br>
26d (see FIG. 5) formed in the two ends of the end plate 26a, as shown in FIGS. 1, 4 and 5.<br>
The movable scroll 26 is supported by the housing 23 via an Oldham ring 39 fitted into the<br>
groove portion 26d (see FIG. 1). An eccentric shaft portion 17a of the crankshaft 17 is fitted<br>
into the bearing portion 26c. The movable scroll 26, by being incorporated into the scroll<br>
compression mechanism 15 in this manner, non-rotatably orbits the interior of the housing 23<br>
 <br>
due to the rotation of the crankshaft 17. The wrap 26b of the movable scroll 26 meshes with<br>
the wrap 24b of the fixed scroll 24, and the compression chamber 40 is formed between the<br>
contact portions of the two wraps 24b, 26b (see FIG. 18(b)). In the compression chamber 40,<br>
the two wraps are displaced toward the center in accompaniment with the orbiting of the<br>
movable scroll 26, and the capacity of the compression chamber decreases. In the high-low<br>
pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1, gas refrigerant in the compression chamber 40 is<br>
compressed in this manner.<br>
In the first embodiment, the movable scroll 26 is manufactured using a novel and special<br>
manufacturing method. The manufacturing method is described in detail below in the<br>
section titled "Method for manufacturing a slider."<br>
d) Other<br>
A communication channel 46 is formed in the scroll compression mechanism 15 across the<br>
fixed scroll 24 and the housing 23. The communication channel 46 is composed of a<br>
scroll-side channel 47 formed as a notch in the fixed scroll 24, and a housing-side channel 48<br>
formed as a notch in the housing 23. The upper end of the communication channel 46, i.e.,<br>
the upper end of the scroll-side channel 47, opens to the enlarged concave portion 42, and the<br>
lower end of the communication channel 46, i.e., the lower end of the housing-side channel<br>
48, opens to the lower end surface of the housing 23. In other words, the lower end opening<br>
of the housing-side channel 48 is a discharge port 49 through which refrigerant in the<br>
communication channel 46 flows to the clearance space 18.<br>
(3) Oldham ring<br>
An Oldham ring 39 is a member for preventing the movable scroll 26 from rotating, and is<br>
primarily composed of a main body 39e, movable scroll-side key portions 39a, 39b, and<br>
housing-side key portions 39c, 39d, as shown in FIGS. 6 to 8. The main body 39e is a<br>
substantially annular molded article, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 8. The movable scroll-side<br>
key portions 39a, 39b face in opposing directions, with the axis of the main body 39e<br>
disposed therebetween, and are a pair of projections that extend to one side along the axial<br>
direction from projection portions that extend to the external peripheral side in the radial<br>
direction of the main body 39e. The housing-side key portions 39c, 39d face in opposing<br>
directions, with the axis of the main body 39e disposed therebetween; are a pair of<br>
projections that extend to the opposite side of the movable scroll-side key portions 39a, 39b<br>
along the axial direction from projection portions that extend to the external peripheral side in<br>
the radial direction of the main body 39e; and are disposed in a position that is inclined<br>
substantially 90° from the movable scroll-side key portions 39a, 39b about the center of the<br>
 <br>
axis. The movable scroll-side key portions 39a, 39b are fitted into a grove portion 26d of<br>
the movable scroll 26, and the housing-side key portions 39c, 39d are fitted into an Oldham<br>
groove (not shown) formed in the housing 23. The Oldham grooves are elliptical grooves<br>
disposed in positions so that the grooves face each other in the housing 23.<br>
In the first embodiment, the Oldham ring 39 is manufactured using a novel and special<br>
manufacturing method. The manufacturing method is described in detail below in the<br>
section titled "Method for manufacturing a slider."<br>
(4) Drive motor<br>
The drive motor 16 is a DC motor in the first embodiment, and is primarily composed of an<br>
annular stator 51 secured to the inner wall surface of the casing 10, and a rotor 52 rotatably<br>
accommodated with a small gap (air gap channel) inside the stator 51. The drive motor 16<br>
is disposed so that the upper end of a coil end 53 formed at the upper end of the stator 51 is at<br>
substantially the same height position as the lower end of the bearing portion 32 of the<br>
housing 23.<br>
A copper wire is wrapped around a tooth portion of the stator 51, and a coil end 53 is formed<br>
above and below the stator. The external peripheral surface of the stator 51 is provided with<br>
core cut portions that have been formed as notches in a plurality of locations from the upper<br>
end surface to the lower end surface of the stator 51 at prescribed intervals in the peripheral<br>
direction. A motor cooling channel 55 that extends in the vertical direction is formed by the<br>
core cut portions between the trunk casing 11 and the stator 51.<br>
A rotor 52 is drivably connected to the movable scroll 26 of the scroll compression<br>
mechanism 15 via the crankshaft 17 disposed in the axial center of the trunk casing 11 so as<br>
to extend in the vertical direction. A guide plate 58 for guiding the refrigerant that has<br>
flowed out of the discharge port 49 of the communication channel 46 to the motor cooling<br>
channel 55 is disposed in the clearance space 18.<br>
(5) Crankshaft<br>
The crankshaft 17 is a substantially cylindrical integrally molded article, as shown in FIG. 1,<br>
and is primarily composed of an eccentric shaft portion ] 7a, a main shaft portion 17b, a<br>
balance weight portion 17c, and a secondary shaft portion 17d. The eccentric shaft portion<br>
17a is accommodated in the bearing portion 26c of the movable scroll 26. The main shaft<br>
portion 17b is accommodated in the bearing hole 33 of the housing 23 via the shaft bearing<br>
34. The secondary shaft portion 17d is accommodated in the lower main bearing 60.<br>
In the first embodiment, the crankshaft 17 is manufactured using a novel and special<br>
manufacturing method. The manufacturing method is described in detail below in the<br>
 <br>
section titled "Method for manufacturing a slider."<br>
(6)	Lower main bearing<br>
The lower main bearing 60 is disposed in a lower space below the drive motor 16. The<br>
lower main bearing 60 is secured to the trunk casing 11, constitutes the lower end-side<br>
bearing of the crankshaft 17, and accommodates the secondary shaft portion 17d of the<br>
crankshaft 17.<br>
In the present embodiment, the lower main bearing 60 is manufactured using a novel and<br>
special manufacturing method. The manufacturing method is described in detail below in<br>
the section titled "Method for manufacturing a slider."<br>
(7)	Suction tube<br>
The suction tube 19 is used for guiding the refrigerant of the refrigerant circuit to the scroll<br>
compression mechanism 15 and is fitted in an airtight manner in the upper wall portion 12 of<br>
the casing 10. The suction tube 19 passes through the low-pressure space 29 in the vertical<br>
direction, and the inside end portion is fitted into the fixed scroll 24.<br>
(8)	Discharge tube<br>
The discharge tube 20 is used for discharging the refrigerant inside the casing 10 to the<br>
exterior of the casing 10, and is fitted in an airtight manner into the trunk casing 11 of the<br>
casing 10. The discharge tube 20 has an inside end portion 36 formed in the shape of a<br>
cylinder extending in the vertical direction, and is secured to the lower end portion of the<br>
housing 23. The inside end opening of the discharge tube 20, i.e., the inlet, is opened<br>
downward.<br>
(Method for manufacturing a slider)<br>
In the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 according to the first<br>
embodiment, a crankshaft 17, a housing 23, a fixed scroll 24, a movable scroll 26, an Oldham<br>
ring 39, and a lower main bearing 60 constitute sliders. These sliders are manufactured<br>
using the manufacturing method described below.<br>
(1) (Raw material)<br>
The iron material as the raw material of the sliders according to the first embodiment<br>
is a billet to which the following components have been added: C: 2.3 to 2.4 wt%, Si: 1.95 to<br>
2.05 wt%, Mn: 0.6 to 0.7 wt%, P: O.035 wt%, S: 
to 1.00 wt%. As used herein, weight ratios are ratios in relation to the entire amount. Also,<br>
the term "billet" refers to a pre-molded material in which an iron material having the<br>
above-described components has been temporarily melted in a melting furnace and thereafter<br>
molded into a cylindrical shape or the like using a continuous casting apparatus. Here, the<br>
 <br>
content of C and Si is determined so as to satisfy two objects: to achieve a tensile strength<br>
and tensile modulus of elasticity that are greater than those of flake graphite cast iron, and to<br>
provide a suitable fluidity for molding a slider preform having a complex shape. The Ni<br>
content is determined so as to achieve a metal structure that improves the toughness of the<br>
metal structure and is suitable for preventing surface cracks during molding.<br>
(2) Manufacturing step<br>
The sliders according to the first embodiment are manufactured via a semi-molten<br>
die casting step, a heat treatment step, a finishing step, and a partial heat treatment step. The<br>
steps will be described in detail below.<br>
a) Semi-molten die casting step<br>
In the semi-molten die casting step, first, a billet is brought to a semi-molten state by<br>
high-frequency heating. Next, the semi-molten billet is introduced into a prescribed metal<br>
mold, and is then molded into a desired shape while a prescribed pressure is applied using a<br>
die casting machine to obtain a slider preform. The metal structure of the slider preform<br>
becomes white iron overall when the slider preform is removed from the mold and rapidly<br>
cooled. The slider preform is slightly larger than the slider that will be ultimately obtained,<br>
and the slider preform becomes the final slider when the machining tolerance has been<br>
removed in a later final finishing step.<br>
In the first embodiment, the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24 is molded using the<br>
metal mold 70 shown in FIG. 9, and the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 is molded using<br>
the metal mold 80 shown in FIG. 11.<br>
(Molding of the fixed scroll)<br>
The metal mold 70 for obtaining a preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24 by semi-molten<br>
die casting is composed of a first mold portion 71 and a second mold portion 72. The shape<br>
of a space portion 73 that is formed when the first mold portion 71 and the second mold<br>
portion 72 are combined corresponds to the shape of the external appearance of the fixed<br>
scroll 24 (i.e., the preform 124) prior to cutting.<br>
A convexity 71a and a convexity 72a are formed on the first mold portion 71 and the<br>
second mold portion 72, respectively, so as to face each other in order to form an opening<br>
formation area P, which is an area in which a discharge hole 41 will be formed in the vicinity<br>
of the center of the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24. The spacing between the convexity<br>
71a and the convexity 72a is set to 4 mm or less. Therefore, the generation of blowholes<br>
CN can be further reduced because the thickness t2 (see FIGS. 9 and 10) of the opening<br>
formation area P is reduced to 4 mm or less.<br>
 <br>
Here, as a comparative example, the thickness of an opening formation area Q in the<br>
vicinity of the center of the preform 224 is kept about the same as the thickness of the<br>
peripheral portions when the preform 224 of a conventional fixed scroll formed by<br>
semi-molten die casting shown in FIG. 13 is considered. Therefore, blowholes CN may be<br>
generated over a broad range inside a part 224a that corresponds to an end plate because<br>
blowholes are also generated in the vicinity of the center of the part 224a that corresponds to<br>
an end plate. Accordingly, the blowholes CN are exposed to the exterior from the discharge<br>
hole 241 when the discharge hole 241 (portion surrounded by two imaginary lines in FIG. 13)<br>
is formed by drilling into the opening formation area Q in the vicinity of the center of the<br>
preform 224. As a result, the fatigue strength of the fixed scroll after manufacture is<br>
considerably reduced.<br>
(Molding of the movable scroll)<br>
The metal mold 80 used in semi-molten die casting of a preform 126 of a movable<br>
scroll 26 is composed of a first mold portion 81 and a second mold portion 82, as shown in<br>
FIG. 11. The shape of the space 83 formed when the first mold portion 81 and the second<br>
mold portion 82 are combined corresponds to the shape of the external appearance of the<br>
movable scroll 26 (i.e., the preform 126) prior to cutting.<br>
A convexity 81a for forming an internal space 26f (see FIG. 5) of the bearing portion<br>
26c of the movable scroll 26 is formed in the first mold portion 81. The spacing of the<br>
convexity 81a and the second mold portion 82 is set to 4 mm or less. Therefore, the<br>
thickness t1 (see FIGS. 11 and 12) of the center portion of the art that corresponds to an end<br>
plate in the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 is 4 mm or less. Accordingly, the<br>
occurrence of blowholes CN can be reduced in this portion.<br>
The preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 has a thickness tl in a center portion 26e<br>
of the part that corresponds to an end plate. This thickness is less than the thickness of the<br>
preform of a movable scroll of an inner drive; i.e., a movable scroll in which a bearing unit<br>
composed of a solid rounded rod fits inside the drive shaft. Accordingly, with this movable<br>
scroll 26, the occurrence of blowholes CN can be reduced In comparison with the movable<br>
scroll of an inner drive.<br>
Here, when a conventional movable scroll preform 226 formed by semi-molten die<br>
casting shown in FIG. 14 is considered as a comparative example, the thickness of the center<br>
portion 226e is about the same as that of the peripheral portions. Therefore, numerous<br>
blowholes CN are generated in the vicinity of the center of the part 226a that corresponds to<br>
an end plate. Accordingly, the strength of the movable scroll formed in such a manner is<br>
 <br>
reduced. In particular, since the largest gas load (or pressure) occurs in the center portion<br>
226e during operation of the scroll compressor, the end plate is likely to deform when the<br>
strength of the center portion 226e is reduced. Furthermore, when the end plate deforms,<br>
the sliding state between the movable scroll and the fixed scroll is degraded, and this results<br>
in abrasion and seizing.<br>
b) Heat treatment step<br>
In the heat treatment step, the slider preform after the semi-molten die casting step is<br>
heat treated. In this heat treatment step, the metal structure of the slider preform changes<br>
from a white iron structure to a metal structure composed of a pearlite/ferrite base and<br>
granular graphite. The graphitization and pearlite transformation of the white iron structure<br>
can be adjusted by adjusting the heat treatment temperature, the holding time, the cooling rate,<br>
and the like. As described in, e.g., "Research of Semi-molten Iron Molding Techniques,"<br>
Honda R&amp;D Technical Review, Vol. 14, No. 1, a metal structure having a tensile strength of<br>
about 500 MPa to 700 MPa and a hardness of about HB 150 (HRB 81 (converted value from<br>
the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table)) to HB 200 (HRB 96 (converted value from the<br>
SAE J 417 hardness conversion table)) can be obtained by holding the metal for 60 minutes at<br>
950°C and thereafter gradually cooling the metal in the furnace at a cooling rate of 0.05 to<br>
0.10°C/sec. Such a metal structure is primarily ferrite, and is therefore soft and has<br>
excellent machinability. However, a built-up edge of a blade during machining may be<br>
formed, and the service life of the blade tool may be reduced. The metal is held for 60<br>
minutes at 1000°C, then air cooled, held for a prescribed length of time at a temperature that<br>
is slightly lower than the initial temperature, and thereafter air cooled, whereby a metal<br>
structure having a tensile strength of about 600 MPa to 900 MPa and a hardness of about HB<br>
200 (HRB 96 (converted value from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table)) to HB 250<br>
(HRB 105, HRC 26 (converted value from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table; HRB<br>
105 is a reference value for extending beyond the effective practical range of a test type)) can<br>
be obtained. In such a metal structure, a substance whose hardness is equal to that of flake<br>
graphite cast iron has the same machinability as flake graphite cast iron, and better<br>
machinability than spheroidal graphite cast iron having the same ductility and toughness.<br>
Also possible is a method in which the metal is held for 60 minutes at 1000°C, cooled in oil,<br>
held for a prescribed length of time at a temperature that is slightly lower than the initial<br>
temperature, and thereafter air cooled, whereby a metal structure having a tensile strength of<br>
about 800 MPa to 1300 MPa and a hardness of about HB 250 (HRB 105, HRC 26 (converted<br>
value from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table; HRB 105 is a reference value for<br>
 <br>
extending beyond the effective practical range of a test type)) to HB 350 (HRB 122, HRC 41<br>
(converted value from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table; HRB 122 is a reference<br>
value for extending beyond the effective practical range of a test type)) can be obtained.<br>
Such a metal structure is primarily pearlite, and is therefore hard and has poor machinability<br>
but possesses excellent abrasion resistance. However, there is a possibility that the metal<br>
will damage the other member of the sliding pair due to excessive hardness.<br>
In the heat treatment step in the first embodiment, the slider preform is heat treated<br>
under conditions that cause the hardness to be greater than HRB 90 (HB 176 (converted value<br>
from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table) but less than HRB 100 (HB 219 (converted<br>
value from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table). It is apparent that when the slider<br>
preform is manufactured using semi-molten die casting, the hardness of the slider preform is<br>
in a proportional relationship with the tensile strength of the slider preform, and therefore<br>
substantially corresponds to a range in which the tensile strength of the slider preform in this<br>
case is from 600 MPa to 900 MPa.<br>
In the heat treatment step in the first embodiment, the slider preform is heat treated<br>
under conditions that cause the hardness to be greater than HRB 90 (HB 176 (converted value<br>
from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table) but less than HRB 100 (HB 219 (converted<br>
value from the SAE J 417 hardness conversion table). It is apparent that when the slider<br>
preform is manufactured using semi-molten die casting, the hardness of the slider preform is<br>
in a proportional relationship with the tensile strength of the slider preform, and therefore<br>
substantially corresponds to a range in which the tensile strength of the slider preform in this<br>
case is from 600 MPa to 900 MPa.<br>
In the heat treatment step of the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24 and the preform 126 of the<br>
movable scroll 26, heat treatment is carried out so that the ratio of the tensile strength in<br>
relation to Young's modulus is 0.0046 or less. Heat treatment is carried out so that the ratio<br>
of the tensile strength in relation to Young's modulus is 0.0033 or more, so that the ferrite<br>
ratio is reduced to a level that allows abrasion resistance to be assured and so that a built-up<br>
edge is less likely to be formed during cutting. Since Young's modulus is 175 to 190 GPa<br>
regardless of the heat treatment, the heat treatment is carried out so that the tensile strength is<br>
about 600 MPa to 900 MPa.<br>
c) Finishing step<br>
In the finishing step, the slider preform is machined and the slider is completed.<br>
In the finishing step of the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24, the discharge hole 41, which is<br>
a through-hole in the opening formation area P, is formed by conventionally known drilling<br>
 <br>
or the like, and the portion corresponding to the warp is cut by end milling or the like. The<br>
height H from the end plate 24P to the distal end, as well as the thickness T, are given<br>
prescribed design values, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
In the finishing step of the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26, the portion corresponding to<br>
the warp is cut by end milling or the like, and a notched portion (counterbore) SC5 for<br>
dispersing the stress of a gas load is formed by end milling or the like. The height H from<br>
the end plate 26P to the distal end, as well as the thickness T, are given prescribed design<br>
values, as shown in FIG. 5. The notched portion (counterbore) SC5 acts to disperse stress of<br>
the base portion of the wrap 26b, which is the portion in which stress is maximally<br>
concentrated.<br>
When the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 according to the first<br>
embodiment is incorporated in a refrigerant circuit of a refrigerant apparatus in which R410A<br>
is used as a refrigerant, the height H and thickness T of the wraps 24b and 26b are designed<br>
so that the ratio (H/T) is 10 to 19, assuming that the ratio of tensile strength in relation to<br>
Young's modulus of the fixed scroll 24 and the movable scroll 26 is 0.0033 to 0.0046. The<br>
amount of flexing (deformation amount) at the distal end of the end portion (end portion<br>
where winding starts) at the scroll center of the wraps 24b, 26b can be kept within an<br>
acceptable range by using such a design, and there is no problem in terms of strength, even<br>
when R410A, which is a gas refrigerant used in the refrigerant apparatus, is at maximal<br>
pressure.<br>
When the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 according to the first<br>
embodiment is incorporated in a refrigerant circuit of a refrigerant apparatus in which carbon<br>
dioxide is used as a refrigerant, the height H and thickness T of the wraps 24b and 26b are<br>
designed so that the ratio (H/T) is 2 to 8, assuming that the ratio of tensile strength in relation<br>
to Young's modulus of the fixed scroll 24 and the movable scroll 26 is 0.0033 to 0.0046.<br>
The amount of flexing (deformation amount) at the distal end of the end portion (end portion<br>
where winding starts) at the scroll center of the wraps 24b, 26b can be kept within an<br>
acceptable range by using such a design, and there is no problem in terms of strength, even<br>
when carbon dioxide, which is a gas refrigerant used in the refrigerant apparatus, is at<br>
maximal pressure.<br>
d) Partial heat treatment step<br>
In the partial heat treatment step, laser heating treatment or high-frequency heating treatment<br>
is carried out in specific locations of the slider, and the fatigue strength and abrasion<br>
resistance of the specific locations is improved. In laser heating treatment or high-frequency<br>
 <br>
heating treatment, a laser beam or a high frequency wave is irradiated so that the surface<br>
hardness of the heated portions is HRC 50 to HRC 65.<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the fixed scroll 24, laser heating treatment is performed<br>
on the peripheral portion SC1 of the base of the wrap 24b in which stress is concentrated<br>
during operation of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1, and high-frequency<br>
heating treatment is performed on the innermost portion SC2 of the wrap 24b (see FIGS. 2<br>
and 3; in the diagrams, the laser heating treatment locations are shaded).<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the movable scroll 26, laser heating treatment is<br>
performed on the peripheral portion SC3 of the base of the wrap 26b and in the peripheral<br>
portion SC4 of the base of the bearing portion 26c in which stress is concentrated during<br>
operation of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1, and high-frequency<br>
heating treatment is performed on the notched portion SC5 formed in the vicinity of the<br>
design center of the end plate 26a and on the innermost portion SC6 of the wrap 26b (see<br>
FIGS. 4 and 5; in the diagrams, the laser heating treatment locations are shaded).<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the crankshaft 17, high-frequency heating treatment is<br>
performed on the eccentric shaft portion 17a and the main shaft portion 17b, which require<br>
abrasion resistance. Laser heating treatment is performed on the peripheral portion SC7 of<br>
the notched portion that is present between the eccentric shaft portion 17a and the main shaft<br>
portion 17b in which stress is concentrated during operation of the compressor (see FIG. 15;<br>
in the diagram, the laser heating treatment locations are shaded.)<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the Oldham ring 39, high-frequency heating treatment is<br>
performed on the movable scroll-side key portions 39a, 39b and the housing-side key<br>
portions 39c, 39d, which require abrasion resistance (see FIGS. 6, 7, and 8; in the diagrams,<br>
the high-frequency heating treatment locations are shaded).<br>
(Operation of a high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor)<br>
Next, the operation of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 will be briefly<br>
described. First, when the drive motor 16 is driven, the drive shaft 17 rotates, and the<br>
movable scroll 26 orbits without rotation. At this point, low-pressure gas refrigerant passes<br>
through the suction tube 19, is suctioned from the peripheral edge of the compression<br>
chamber 40 into the compression chamber 40, is compressed as the capacity of the<br>
compression chamber 40 changes, and becomes a high-pressure gas refrigerant (see FIG.<br>
18(b)). The high-pressure gas refrigerant passes from the center portion of the compression<br>
chamber 40 through the discharge channel 41; is discharged to the muffler space 45; then<br>
passes through communication channel 46, the scroll-side channel 47, the housing-side<br>
 <br>
channel 48, and the discharge port 49; flows out to the clearance space 18; and flows<br>
downward between the guide plate 58 and the inner surface of the trunk casing 11. A<br>
portion of the gas refrigerant branches off and flows in the peripheral direction between the<br>
guide plate 58 and the drive motor 16 when the gas refrigerant flows downward between the<br>
guide plate 58 and the inner surface of the trunk casing 11. At this point, lubricating oil<br>
mixed with the gas refrigerant separates off. On the other hand, the other portion of the<br>
branched gas refrigerant flows downward through the motor cooling channel 55 to the space<br>
below the motor, and then reverses course and flows upward through the motor cooling<br>
channel 55 on the side (left side in FIG. 1) facing the communication channel 46 or the air<br>
gap channel between the stator 51 and the rotor 52. Thereafter, the gas refrigerant that has<br>
passed through the guide plate 58 and the gas refrigerant that has flowed from the air gap<br>
channel or the motor cooling channel 55 merge at the clearance space 18. The merged gas<br>
refrigerant flows from the inside-end portion 36 of the discharge tube 20 to the discharge tube<br>
20, and is then discharged to the exterior of the casing 10. The gas refrigerant discharged to<br>
the exterior of the casing 10 circulates through the refrigerant circuit, then passes through the<br>
suction tube 19 again, and is suctioned and compressed in the scroll compression mechanism<br>
15.<br>
(Comparison of a conventional scroll in which an FC material is used, and the scroll of first<br>
embodiment)<br>
Next, a comparison is made with reference to FIGS. 16 to 18 between a conventional fixed<br>
scroll 324 and movable scroll 326 that use FC250, and the fixed scroll 24 and movable scroll<br>
26 of the compressor 1 according to the first embodiment. In this case, the height H of the<br>
wraps 285, 287, 24b, 26b of the scrolls 324, 326, 24, 26 are all set to be the same. The<br>
thickness T of the wraps 285, 287 are set based on design guidelines for conventional<br>
strength in the conventional fixed scroll 324 and movable scroll 326, and the thickness T of<br>
the wraps 24b, 26b are set based on the design guidelines described above for the fixed scroll<br>
24 and the movable scroll 26. A semi-molten die casting material is used for the fixed scroll<br>
24 and the movable scroll 26, and since the strength is increased in comparison with<br>
conventional FC250, the thickness T of the wraps is reduced in comparison with the<br>
conventional fixed scroll 324 and movable scroll 326.<br>
The shaded portions of FIGS. 16(a), 16(b), and 16(c) indicate the partition surface area,<br>
compression work area, and thrust area, respectively, in a conventional fixed scroll 324.<br>
The partition surface area is a lateral cross section surface area of a wrap (wrap 285, in this<br>
case). In contrast, shaded portions of FIGS. 16(d), 16(e), and 16(f) indicate the partition<br>
 <br>
surface area, compression work area, and thrust area, respectively, in the fixed scroll 24.<br>
When FIGS. 16(a) and 16(d) are compared, the partition surface area is reduced in the fixed<br>
scroll 24 in comparison with the conventional fixed scroll 324. This is because the ratio<br>
(H/T) of the height H to the thickness T of the wrap 24b is increased in association with<br>
higher strength. When a comparison is made with reference to FIGS. 16(c) and 16(f)<br>
between the effective compression surface areas obtained by subtracting the partition surface<br>
area from the surface area of compression work area, the effective compression surface area<br>
is 48 cm , or about 20% greater in the fixed scroll 24, in comparison with the 40 cm of the<br>
conventional fixed scroll 324.<br>
The shaded portions of FIGS. 17(a), 17(b), and 17(c) indicate the partition surface area,<br>
compression work area, and thrust area, respectively, in a conventional movable scroll 326.<br>
The partition surface area is a lateral cross section surface area of a wrap (wrap 287, in this<br>
case). In contrast, shaded portions of FIGS. 17(d), 17(e). and 17(f) indicate the partition<br>
surface area, compression work area, and thrust area, respectively, in the movable scroll 26.<br>
When FIGS. 17(a) and 17(d) are compared, the partition surface area is reduced in the<br>
movable scroll 26 in comparison with the conventional movable scroll 326. This is because<br>
the ratio (H/T) of the height H to the thickness T of the wrap 26b is increased in association<br>
with higher strength. When a comparison is made with reference to FIGS. 17(c) and 17(f)<br>
between the effective compression surface areas obtained by subtracting the partition surface<br>
area from the surface area of compression work area, the effective compression surface area<br>
is 32 cm , or about 15% greater in the movable scroll 26, in comparison with the 28 cm of<br>
the conventional movable scroll 326.<br>
The shaded portion of FIG. 18(a) shows the suction capacity formed by the conventional<br>
fixed scroll 324 and movable scroll 326 having wraps 285, 287 in which the thickness T is<br>
relatively thick; and the shaded portion of FIG. 18(b) shows the suction capacity formed by<br>
the fixed scroll 24 and movable scroll 26 having wraps 24b, 26b in which the thickness T is<br>
relatively small (thin). In the compressor 1, the thickness T of the wraps 24b, 26b is<br>
reduced and the ratio (H/T) is increased. The suction capacity is thereby made about 1.5<br>
times greater in comparison with a compressor in which the conventional scrolls 324, 326 are<br>
adopted.<br>
(Tests)<br>
(1) Abrasion resistance test and "breaking-in" test<br>
First, a pin-shaped test piece 412a and a disc-shaped test piece 412b such as those shown in<br>
FIGS. 19 were manufactured from a material fabricated by semi-molten die casting, and test<br>
 <br>
pieces 412a, 412b having different levels of hardness were fabricated by varying the heat<br>
treatment conditions of the material fabricated by semi-molten die casting. The test pieces<br>
412a, 412b were set in a pin/disc test apparatus 401 such as that shown in FIG. 19, the<br>
pin-shaped test piece 412a that was set in a holder 413 was made to slide for two hours<br>
against the disc-shaped test piece 412b under conditions of an average sliding speed of 2.0<br>
m/s and a constant surface pressure load of 20 MPa in a liquid mixture 416 composed of<br>
ethereal oil (100°C) and R410A refrigerant stored in a container 410, and the amount<br>
abrasion was measured. The surface pressure in this case was adjusted by using the load<br>
applied to the lower-side shaft 411b. A mechanical seal 414 was provided between an<br>
upper-side rotor shaft 411a and the container 410. The amount of abrasion in this was<br>
obtained by adding the pin abrasion amount and the disc abrasion amount.<br>
The data obtained from this experiment is summarized in the bar graph shown in FIG. 20.<br>
The relationship between the abrasion amount and the hardness of the test pieces<br>
manufactured by semi-molten die casting (hereinafter referred to as semi-molten die cast test<br>
pieces) is shown in the left-side area facing the graph. For reference, the abrasion amount<br>
and the hardness of the test pieces composed of FC250 (hereinafter referred to as FC250 test<br>
pieces), which is a conventional material, are shown in the right-side area facing the graph.<br>
The test pieces composed of FC250 have a level of hardness (HRB 101.0) that indicates good<br>
"breaking-in" characteristics in a conventional compressor. Also, the base structure of<br>
FC250 test piece exhibiting such a level of hardness contains 95% or higher pearlite<br>
structure.<br>
Here, in view of the left-side area, it is apparent that the hardness and abrasion amount of the<br>
semi-molten die casting test pieces have a substantially proportional relationship. When the<br>
semi-molten die casting test pieces and the FC250 test piece are compared, it is apparent that<br>
the semi-molten die casting test piece having a hardness of HRB 103.7 has dramatically less<br>
abrasion amount than the FC250 test piece, the semi-molten die casting test piece having a<br>
hardness of HRB 98.0 has substantially the same abrasion amount as the FC250 test piece,<br>
and the semi-molten die casting test piece having a hardness of HRB 87.4 has dramatically<br>
more abrasion amount than the FC250 test piece. In other words, it is apparent that the<br>
semi-molten die casting test piece having a hardness of HRB 98.0 has about the same<br>
"breaking-in" characteristic as the FC250 test piece having a hardness of HRB 100 or higher.<br>
This suggests that the abrasion phenomenon depends on not only on the hardness, but also on<br>
the base structure. In other words, when the ratio of the pearlite structure constituting the<br>
base structure is high, the "breaking-in" characteristic of the molded article is poor, even<br>
 <br>
when the hardness is the same. In this case, hardness that can demonstrate good<br>
"breaking-in" characteristics is a hardness that is empirically determined to have an abrasion<br>
amount of greater than 5 μm but less than 13 μm. Accordingly, a semi-molten die casting<br>
test piece that has a level of hardness greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 has<br>
excellent "breaking-in characteristics." This is supported by the "breaking-in" curve of a<br>
semi-molten die cast article shown in FIG. 21. It is apparent from FIG 21 that 100 hours is<br>
required for sufficient breaking-in when the hardness is HRB 100 or higher, but "breaking-in"<br>
is substantially completed in ten or so hours when the hardness is HRB 100 or less.<br>
(2) Seizing resistance test<br>
First, a pin-shaped test piece 412a and a disc-shaped test piece 412b such as those shown in<br>
FIGS. 19 were manufactured from a material fabricated by semi-molten die casting, and test<br>
pieces 412a, 412b having different levels of hardness were fabricated by varying the heat<br>
treatment conditions of the material fabricated by semi-molten die casting. The test pieces<br>
412a, 412b were set in a pin/disc test apparatus 401 such as that shown in FIG. 19, and a load<br>
(surface pressure) was applied in steps of 15.6 MPa under conditions of an average sliding<br>
speed of 2.0 m/s in a liquid mixture 416 composed of ethereal oil (100°C) and R410A<br>
refrigerant stored in a container 410. The point at which the frictional torque, as detected by<br>
a torque detector 415, rapidly increased was determined to be the point at which seizing<br>
occurs, and the surface pressure at this time was used as the surface pressure at which seizing<br>
occurs. The surface pressure in this case was adjusted by using the load applied to the<br>
lower-side shaft 411b. A mechanical seal 414 was provided between an upper-side rotor<br>
shaft 411a and the container 410.<br>
The data obtained from this experiment is summarized in the bar graph shown in FIG. 22.<br>
The relationship between the surface pressure at which seizing occurs and the hardness of the<br>
test pieces manufactured by semi-molten die casting (hereinafter referred to as semi-molten<br>
die cast test pieces) is shown in this graph.<br>
It is apparent from FIG. 22 that the surface pressure at which seizing occurs is dramatically<br>
reduced when the hardness of the semi-molten die cast test piece is between HRB 98.0 and<br>
HRB 103.8. In other words, this shows that seizing more readily occurs when the hardness<br>
of the semi-molten die cast molded test piece is HRB 100 or higher. When the movable<br>
scroll and fixed scroll are manufactured using semi-molten die casting, the hardness of the<br>
movable scroll and the fixed scroll must be less than HRB 100 in order to prevent the<br>
movable scroll and the fixed scroll from seizing during abnormal operation of the<br>
compressor.<br>
 <br>
(3)	Ductility test<br>
FIG. 23 shows the relationship between the tensile elongation and the hardness of a molded<br>
article manufactured using semi-molten die casting. The tensile elongation was measured in<br>
accordance with the test method described in JIS Z2241. In this tensile test, the shape of the<br>
test piece was that of test piece #4 or #5 described in JIS Z2201.<br>
It is apparent from FIG. 23 that the elongation and the hardness of a molded article<br>
manufactured by semi-molten die casting (hereinafter referred to as a semi-molten die cast<br>
article) are in an inverse proportional relationship. When compared with a conventional<br>
FC250 or FCD600 molded article (hereinafter referred to as a conventional molded article), it<br>
is apparent that the semi-molten die cast article exhibits dramatically higher ductility than a<br>
conventional molded article. In the case of a semi-molten die cast article, the fact is that a<br>
built-up edge is readily formed during machining, and grinding processability is degraded,<br>
when the tensile elongation is 14% or higher; fine scrapings are readily produced in the case<br>
that cracking has occurred when the tensile elongation is 8% or lower (possibly due to fluid<br>
backflow (hydraulic compression), which may occur when the semi-molten die cast article is<br>
a movable scroll or a fixed scroll); and the effect of preventing such situations cannot be<br>
sufficiently provided by improving the ductility. For this reason, the semi-molten die cast<br>
article preferably ideally has a tensile elongation that is greater than 8% but less than 14%.<br>
Therefore, the hardness of the semi-molten die cast article is ideally greater than HRB 90 but<br>
less than HRB 100.<br>
(4)	Cutting test<br>
FIG. 24 shows the relationship between the notching distance and the cutting resistance of a<br>
molded article manufactured using semi-molten die casting. The cutting test was carried out<br>
using a down cut method with the aid of an end mill as a cutting blade under dry conditions at<br>
an end mill rotational speed of 6000 rpm and a feed rate of 1800 mm/min - 0.05/blade. The<br>
hardness of the semi-molten die cast article at this time was HRB 98, and the hardness of the<br>
reference FC250 molded article was HRB 101.<br>
It is apparent from FIG. 24 that with a semi-molten die cast article, cutting resistance<br>
increases in a proportional fashion as the notching distance increases in the same manner as<br>
for an FC250 molded article, but the absolute value is less than that of an FC250 molded<br>
article.<br>
(5)	Tool abrasion test<br>
FIG. 25 shows a comparison of the cutting tool abrasion for a molded article manufactured<br>
using semi-molten die casting. The tool abrasion test was carried out in the same manner as<br>
 <br>
the cutting test by using a down cut method with the aid of an end mill as a cutting blade<br>
under dry conditions at an end mill rotational speed of 8000 rpm and a feed rate of 1920<br>
mm/min - 0.04/blade. The data in FIG. 25 is composed of values obtained by rotating a tool<br>
to the cutting distance noted above the bars. The hardness of the semi-molten die cast<br>
articles at this time was HRB 93 to 95 and HRB 98 to 100, and the hardness of the reference<br>
FC250 molded article was HRB 101.<br>
It is apparent from FIG. 25 that when the FC250 molded article and the semi-molten die cast<br>
article having a hardness of 93 to 95 are compared, the tool abrasion amount for the two<br>
molded articles is substantially the same at the external peripheral portion of the blade and<br>
the base of the blade regardless of the fact that the semi-molten die cast article having a<br>
hardness of 93 to 95 has a longer cutting distance than the FC250 molded article. Therefore,<br>
the semi-molten die cast article having a hardness of 93 to 95 has about the same or better<br>
machinability than the FC250 molded article. When a comparison is made between the<br>
semi-molten die cast article having a hardness of 93 to 95 and the semi-molten die cast article<br>
having a hardness of 98 to 100, the semi-molten die cast article having a hardness of 93 to 95<br>
has a lower abrasion amount at the base of the blade than the semi-molten die cast article<br>
having a hardness of 98 to 100 regardless of the fact that the semi-molten die cast article<br>
having a hardness of 93 to 95 has a longer cutting distance than the semi-molten die cast<br>
article having a hardness of 98 to 100. In other words, the semi-molten die cast article<br>
having a hardness of 93 to 95 has dramatically better machinability than the semi-molten die<br>
cast article having a hardness of 98 to 100.<br>
(Characteristics of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor according to<br>
first embodiment)<br>
(1)<br>
In the first embodiment, the movable scroll 26 and fixed scroll 24 are manufactured via a<br>
semi-molten die casting step and a heat treatment step. Accordingly, a movable scroll and<br>
fixed scroll can be readily provided by this manufacturing method with higher tensile<br>
strength and hardness than a movable scroll and fixed scroll composed of flake graphite cast<br>
iron manufactured using conventional sand casting.<br>
(2)<br>
In the first embodiment, the movable scroll preform and the fixed scroll preform are<br>
manufactured via a semi-molten die casting step and a heat treatment step, and the hardness is<br>
adjusted to be greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. The tensile strength of the<br>
movable scroll preform and the fixed scroll preform substantially corresponds to the range<br>
 <br>
from 600 MPa to 900 Mpa. Accordingly, when this method for manufacturing a compressor<br>
slider is adopted, the end plates 24a, 26a of the movable scroll 26 and the fixed scroll 24, as<br>
well as the wraps 24b, 26b, can be made thinner. Therefore, the scroll compressor 1 can be<br>
given a smaller diameter, and, consequently, thrust loss can be reduced and capacity can be<br>
increased. Also, the stress generated in the scroll is greater than during normal operation<br>
(during full load) when the capacity is controlled during an operation characterized by a high<br>
compression ratio, even in a capacity controller based on an unloader piston, but since<br>
strength is improved and toughness is enhanced, the possibility that the scroll will be<br>
damaged or the like can be reduced. Such a movable scroll 26 and fixed scroll 24 have<br>
excellent toughness in comparison with an FC material, and damage is not likely to occur<br>
from a sudden increase in internal pressure or the inclusion of foreign matter. Even if<br>
damage were to occur, fine scrapings are not likely to be produced and the pipes do not need<br>
to be washed. When a movable scroll preform and fixed scroll preform composed of flake<br>
graphite cast iron manufactured by sand casting are machined and the final movable scroll<br>
and fixed scroll are formed, the movable scroll preform and fixed scroll preform are<br>
ordinarily re-gripped a number of times in order to remove distortions produced by<br>
machining. However, there in no concern for distortions caused by machining when a<br>
movable scroll preform and fixed scroll preform having such a high tensile strength are<br>
machined. Therefore, adopting the present manufacturing method allows the cost of<br>
re-gripping to be reduced.<br>
(3)<br>
It is apparent that when a slider manufactured by semi-molten die casting is heat treated, the<br>
tensile strength of the slider is in a proportional relationship with the hardness of the slider.<br>
Therefore, tensile strength can be assured in the slider according to the first embodiment by<br>
merely measuring the hardness.<br>
(4)<br>
In the heat treatment step of the first embodiment, the heat treatment is carried out so that the<br>
hardness of the movable scroll preform and the fixed scroll preform is greater than HRB 90<br>
but less than HRB 100. For this reason, a movable scroll 26 and fixed scroll 24 that can<br>
demonstrate sufficient durability during compressor operation, that readily undergo<br>
"breaking-in" as early as possible, and that do not seize during abnormal operation can be<br>
manufactured when the method for manufacturing the compressor slider is adopted. When<br>
the hardness is in this range, machining of the movable scroll preform and the fixed scroll<br>
preform is improved, the movable scroll preform and fixed scroll preform are less likely to be<br>
 <br>
damaged, and handling is facilitated. For this reason, tool abrasion and tool chipping are<br>
less likely to occur, tool service life is extended, a built-up edge is less likely to form, the<br>
grinding processability is good, machining time can be reduced, and machining costs can<br>
therefore be reduced. Regardless the scrolls have superior tool abrasion and machining time<br>
because of lower hardness in relation to FCD having the same tensile strength (tensile<br>
strength is high at the same level of hardness), it can be said that higher tensile strength can<br>
be achieved. Also, the movable scroll 26, the Oldham ring 39, the seal (not shown), and the<br>
like are unlikely to be damaged because surface roughness of them is readily reduced in<br>
comparison with an FC material.<br>
(5)<br>
In the first embodiment, the fixed scroll 24 is manufactured by molding a metal material by<br>
semi-molten die casting using a metal mold 70 having convexities 71a, 72a in which an<br>
opening formation area P can be thinly formed in the vicinity of the center of the preform 124,<br>
and thereafter forming a discharge hole 41 in the thin opening formation area P. An opening<br>
formation area P of the discharge hole 41 can be formed with the aid of the convexities 71a,<br>
72a to a thickness of 4 mm or less in the vicinity of the center of the portion that corresponds<br>
to the end plate in the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24. Accordingly, the occurrence of<br>
blowholes CN can be reduced in the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24. Therefore, only<br>
small divided blowholes CN are present in the periphery away from the vicinity of the center<br>
inside the end plate 24a in the fixed scroll 24. As a result, the likelihood that a blowhole CN<br>
inside the preform 124 will be exposed to the exterior is eliminated even if a discharge hole<br>
41 is formed in the opening formation area P of the preform 124, and a reduction in fatigue<br>
strength can be inhibited.<br>
(6)<br>
In the first embodiment, the movable scroll 26 is manufactured by molding a metal material<br>
by semi-molten die casting using a metal mold 80 having a convexity 81a in which a<br>
prescribed portion can be formed to a thickness of 4 mm or less in the vicinity of the center of<br>
the preform 126. Accordingly, the occurrence of blowholes CN in the preform 126 of the<br>
movable scroll 26 can be reduced. Therefore, only small divided blowholes CN are present<br>
in the periphery away from the vicinity of the center inside the end plate 26a in the movable<br>
scroll 26.<br>
(?)<br>
Constituent elements having very few defects are adopted in the high-low pressure dome-type<br>
scroll compressor 1 of the first embodiment. For this reason, the high-low pressure<br>
 <br>
dome-type compressor 1 can also compress carbon dioxide and other high-pressure<br>
refrigerants.<br>
(8)<br>
There are problems in that near-net shaping is difficult and machinability is poor with<br>
high-carbon steel and ductile iron as high-strength materials. Therefore, a scroll is often<br>
manufactured using FC250 or another ordinary cast iron in a conventional scroll compressor.<br>
In contrast, in the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 according to the first<br>
embodiment, the fixed scroll 24 and movable scroll 26 can endowed with high strength by<br>
molding with the aid of semi-molten die casting.<br>
For this reason, capacity can be increased considerably without substantially changing the<br>
outside diameter in the compressor 1, as shown in FIG. 18 and other diagrams.<br>
(9)<br>
In comparison with a conventional material such as FC250, an article produced by die casting<br>
(referred to herein as semi-molten die casting), in which an iron material In a semi-molten<br>
(semi-solid) state is pressed into a mold to manufacture a casting, has high strength even<br>
without performing special heat treatment, but tensile strength can be further improved by<br>
performing heat treatment that involves holding the article at a prescribed temperature for a<br>
prescribed length of time and adjusting the cooling speed.<br>
However, when the tensile strength is increased to a level that is not conventionally used,<br>
other problems occur when the ratio (H/T), i.e., ratio of the height (H) to thickness (T) of the<br>
wrap, is determined solely from the conventional viewpoint of strength based on whether<br>
fatigue damage will occur or not. In other words, when the ratio (H/T) is made excessively<br>
high because of the strength, drawbacks occur even if there is no problem in terms of strength.<br>
That is, because the deformation of the wraps 24b, 26b is too great when cutting is performed,<br>
the result is that the machining allowance and cutting feeding of end milling or the like<br>
cannot be increased and machining time is extended, that the deformation amount (flexing<br>
amount) of the wraps 24b, 26b is increased and performance is reduced during operation of<br>
the compressor 1, and that noise is increased by contact with a counterpart scroll.<br>
Furthermore, in the case wraps 24b, 26b, which are shaped in the same manner as the scrolls<br>
24, 26, are existed, distortions tend to appear when strength is considerably increased by heat<br>
treatment. When the strength is excessively high, machining speed during cutting is<br>
reduced and costs are increased.<br>
In view of the above, in the compressor 1, the ratio of the tensile strength in relation to<br>
Young's modulus of the scrolls 24, 26 after heat treatment is determined so that added costs<br>
 <br>
are not incurred due to excessively increasing the strength by heat treatment. This is the<br>
result of research to determine the sufficient level of tensile strength from the viewpoint of<br>
fatigue strength when the ratio (H/T) of the wrap is determined with consideration given to<br>
the upper limit of the deformation amount of the wraps 24b, 26b that is required from the<br>
viewpoint of machining time, lost performance, and noise. Specifically, the ratio of tensile<br>
strength to Young's modulus is set to 0.0046 or less, as described above, so as to limit the<br>
amount of increased strength by heat treatment.<br>
As described above, in the design of the scrolls 24, 26 in this case, problems during operation,<br>
such as a higher level of noise and reduced performance due to flexing of the wraps 24b, 26b,<br>
can be reduced while satisfying strength requirements because a balance has been achieved<br>
with the Young's modulus (toughness) without excessive strengthening. Since flexing of the<br>
wraps 24b, 26b during cutting is reduced, manufacturing costs can be reduced by shortening<br>
machining time and obtaining other benefits.<br>
As described above, the tensile strength of the scrolls 24, 26 can be set to 1000 MPa or higher<br>
depending on the heat treatment, but in this case, the increase in strength by heat treatment is<br>
limited.<br>
On the other hand, the tensile strength of the scrolls 24, 26 can be set to about 500 MPa by<br>
reducing the cooling speed. Conversely, it is illogical to spend time in heat treatment in<br>
order to limit the level of strength, and since drawbacks arise in that abrasion resistance is<br>
reduced when the ferrite ratio of the metal structure is increased, heat treatment is carried out<br>
so that the ratio of the tensile strength to Young's modulus is 0.0033 or higher in the<br>
compressor 1.<br>
(10)<br>
In the first embodiment, the crankshaft 17, the movable scroll 26, the fixed scroll 24, and the<br>
Oldham ring 39 are manufactured via a semi-molten die casting step and a heat treatment step.<br>
Accordingly, raw material costs, machining costs, and tool abrasion expenses can be kept low<br>
in comparison with conventional sand casting, and grinding waste, liquid machining waste,<br>
and other types of waste can be reduced. Also, the crankshaft 17, fixed scroll 24, movable<br>
scroll 26, and Oldham ring 39 can easily be provided with higher tensile strength and higher<br>
hardness than a crankshaft, movable scroll, fixed scroll, and Oldham ring composed of flake<br>
graphite cast iron and manufactured by conventional sand casting.<br>
(H)<br>
In the first embodiment, the crankshaft preform, the movable scroll preform, the fixed scroll<br>
preform, and the Oldham ring preform were manufacture via a semi-molten die casting step<br>
 <br>
and a heat treatment step, and the hardness of these preforms was adjusted so as to be greater<br>
than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. In this case, the tensile strength of the crankshaft<br>
preform, the movable scroll preform, the fixed scroll preform, and the Oldham ring preform<br>
substantially corresponds to a range from 600 MPa to 900 MPa. Accordingly, adoption of<br>
this method for manufacturing a compressor slider allows the end plates 24a, 26a of the<br>
movable scroll 26 and the fixed scroll 24, as well as the wraps 24b, 26b (*9), to be made<br>
thinner, and the Oldham ring 39 to be made thinner as well. Also, the diameter of the<br>
crankshaft 17 can be reduced. Therefore, the diameter of the scroll compressor 1 can be<br>
reduced, and the thrust loss can consequently be reduced and capacity increased. Also, the<br>
stress generated in the scroll is greater than during normal operation (during full load) when<br>
the capacity is controlled during high-compression ratio operation, even in a capacity<br>
controller based on an unloader piston, but since strength is improved and toughness is<br>
enhanced, the possibility that the scroll will be damaged or the like can be reduced. Such a<br>
crankshaft 17, movable scroll 26, fixed scroll 24, and Oldham ring 39 have excellent<br>
toughness in comparison with an FC material, and damage is not likely to occur from a<br>
sudden pressure increase due to the inclusion of foreign matter. Even if damage were to<br>
occur, fine scrapings are not likely to be produced and the pipes do not need to be washed.<br>
When a crankshaft preform, a movable scroll preform, a fixed scroll preform, and an Oldham<br>
ring preform composed of flake graphite cast iron and manufactured by sand casting are<br>
machined and the final crankshaft 17, movable scroll 26, fixed scroll 24, and the Oldham ring<br>
39 are formed, the crankshaft preform, the movable scroll preform, the fixed scroll preform,<br>
and the Oldham ring preform are ordinarily re-gripped a number of times in order to remove<br>
distortions produced by machining. However, there in no concern for distortions caused by<br>
machining when a crankshaft preform, a movable scroll preform, a fixed scroll preform, and<br>
an Oldham ring preform having such a high tensile strength are machined. Therefore,<br>
adopting the present manufacturing method allows the cost of re-gripping to be reduced.<br>
(12)<br>
It is apparent that when a slider manufactured by semi-molten die casting is heat treated, the<br>
tensile strength of the slider is in a proportional relationship with the hardness of the slider.<br>
Therefore, tensile strength can be assured in the slider according to the first embodiment by<br>
merely measuring the hardness.<br>
(13)<br>
In the heat treatment step of the first embodiment, heat treatment is carried out so that the<br>
hardness of the crankshaft preform, the movable scroll preform, the fixed scroll preform, and<br>
 <br>
the Oldham ring preform is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. For this reason, a<br>
crankshaft 17, a movable scroll 26, a fixed scroll 24, and an Oldham ring 39 that can<br>
demonstrate sufficient durability during compressor operation, that readily undergo<br>
"breaking-in" as early as possible, and that do not seize during abnormal operation can be<br>
manufactured when this method for manufacturing the compressor slider is adopted. When<br>
the hardness is in this range, machining of the crankshaft preform, the movable scroll preform,<br>
the fixed scroll preform, and the Oldham ring preform is improved; the crankshaft preform,<br>
the movable scroll preform, the fixed scroll preform, and the Oldham ring preform are less<br>
likely to be damaged; and handling is facilitated. For this reason, tool abrasion and tool<br>
chipping are less likely to occur, tool service life is extended, a built-up edge is less likely to<br>
form, the grinding processability is good, machining time can be reduced, and machining<br>
costs can therefore be reduced. It should also be noted that Regardless the scrolls have<br>
superior tool abrasion and machining time because of lower hardness in relation to FCD<br>
having the same tensile strength (tensile strength is high at the same level of hardness), it can<br>
be said that higher tensile strength can be achieved. Also, the movable scroll 26 is unlikely<br>
to damage the Oldham ring 39, the seal (not shown), and the like because surface roughness<br>
of them can be more readily obtained in comparison with an FC material.<br>
(14)<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the first embodiment, a stress concentration area<br>
(peripheral portion SC1 of the base of the wrap 24b and the innermost portion SC2 of the<br>
wrap 24b) of the fixed scroll 24 is subjected to partial heat treatment. Accordingly,<br>
sufficient fatigue strength can be imparted to the stress concentration area in the fixed scroll<br>
24 while the slider, which requires slidability, retains good "breaking-in" characteristics.<br>
(15)<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the first embodiment, the stress concentration area<br>
(peripheral portion SC3 of the base of the wrap 26b, the notched portion SC5 formed in the<br>
vicinity of the design center of the end plate 26a, the peripheral portion SC4 of the base of the<br>
bearing portion 26c, and the innermost portion SC6 of the wrap 26b) of the movable scroll 26<br>
is subjected to partial heat treatment. Accordingly, sufficient fatigue strength can be<br>
imparted to the stress concentration area in the movable scroll 26 while the slider, which<br>
requires slidability, retains good "breaking-in" characteristics.<br>
(16)<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the first embodiment, the eccentric shaft portion 17a and<br>
the main shaft portion 17b of the crankshaft 17 are subjected to high-frequency heating<br>
 <br>
treatment. Accordingly, the eccentric shaft portion 17a and the main shaft portion 17b can<br>
be endowed with sufficient abrasion resistance. Therefore, the service life of the crankshaft<br>
17 can be extended.<br>
(17)<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the first embodiment, the peripheral portion SC7 of the<br>
notched portion that is present between the eccentric shaft portion 17a and the main shaft<br>
portion 17b of the crankshaft 17 is subjected to laser heating treatment. Accordingly, the<br>
stress concentration portion of the crankshaft 17 can be endowed with sufficient fatigue<br>
strength.<br>

In the semi-molten die casting of the first embodiment, the balance weight portion 17c is<br>
integrally formed with the crankshaft 17. Accordingly, a separate ring portion or the like as<br>
a balance weight is not required. Therefore, material costs associated with a balance weight<br>
can be reduced. Also, in the manufacture of a balance weight, the balance weight is cored to<br>
a rough shape and then a machining step was required to adjust or otherwise modify the<br>
balance, but the crankshaft 17 according to the present invention is manufactured by<br>
semi-molten die casting. Therefore, material can be molded to a shape that is very<br>
approximate to the final shape, and the number of steps for manufacturing a compressor can<br>
be reduced. Therefore, the compressor crankshaft 17 can contribute to a reduction in the<br>
costs to manufacture a compressor.<br>
(19)<br>
In the partial heat treatment step of the first embodiment, the movable scroll-side key<br>
portions 39a, 39b and the housing-side key portions 39c, 39d of the Oldham ring 39 are<br>
subjected to high-frequency heating treatment. Accordingly, the movable scroll-side key<br>
portions 39a, 39b and the housing-side key portions 39c, 39d can be endowed with sufficient<br>
abrasion resistance. Therefore, the service life of the Oldham ring 39 can be extended.<br>
(Modified example of first embodiment)<br>
(A)<br>
An airtight high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 was adopted in the first<br>
embodiment, but the compressor may be a high-pressure dome-type compressor or a<br>
low-pressure dome-type compressor. The compressor may also be a semi-airtight or open<br>
compressor.<br>
(B)<br>
A scroll compression mechanism 15 was used in the scroll compressor 1 according<br>
 <br>
to the first embodiment, but the compression mechanism may be a rotary compression<br>
mechanism, a reciprocating compression mechanism, a screw compression mechanism, or the<br>
like. The scroll compression mechanism 15 may be a double-toothed or co-rotation-type<br>
scroll.<br>
(C)<br>
In the first embodiment, a billet was used in which the following components were<br>
added: C: 2.3 to 2.4 wt%, Si: 1.95 to 2.05 wt%, Mn: 0.6 to 0.7 wt%, P: 
wt%, Cr: 0.00 to 0.50 wt%, Ni: 0.50 to 1.00 wt%. The elemental ratio of the iron material<br>
may be arbitrarily determined as long as the ratio does not depart from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
(D)<br>
In the first embodiment, an Oldham ring 39 was used as the rotation-preventing<br>
mechanism, but a pin, a ball coupling, a crank, or any other mechanism may be used as the<br>
rotation-preventing mechanism.<br>
(E)<br>
In the first embodiment, an example was given of the case in which the scroll<br>
compressor 1 was used in a refrigerant circuit, but the application is not limited to air<br>
conditioning, and can also be made to a compressor used alone or incorporated into a system,<br>
or to a blower, a supercharger, a pump, or the like.<br>
(F)<br>
A lubricating oil is present in the compressor 1 according to the first embodiment,<br>
but an oilless or oil-free (which may or may not contain oil) compressor, blower,<br>
supercharger, or pump may also be used.<br>
(G)<br>
The high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor 1 according to the first embodiment was<br>
an outer drive-type scroll compressor, but the scroll compressor according to the present<br>
embodiment may be an inner drive-type scroll compressor, Also, in such a case, the pin<br>
shaft portion for the inner drive of the movable scroll may be selectively heated by<br>
high-frequency heating or another method after the heat treatment step, and the surface<br>
hardness of the pin shaft portion may be set to be greater than HRC 50 but less than HRC 65.<br>
In this manner, the abrasion resistance of the pin shaft portion of the inner drive can be<br>
considerably improved.<br>
(H)<br>
In the first embodiment, the slider preform was formed into a final slider via a final finishing<br>
 <br>
step, but the finishing step may be omitted in the case that near-net shaping to a substantially<br>
completed article is possible in the semi-molten die casting step.<br>
(I)<br>
In the heat treatment step of the first embodiment, the entire slider preform was heat treated,<br>
but when the slider preform is the movable scroll 26 or the fixed scroll 24, the hardness may<br>
be set to be greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100 for only the distal ends of the wraps<br>
24b, 26b and the surface (thrust surface) portion of the end plate side, which are important<br>
locations in terms of seizing resistance, abrasion resistance, and "breaking-in" characteristics.<br>
The ferrite surface area ratio may be set to be greater than 5% but less than 50%, and the<br>
graphite surface area ratio may be set to be greater than 2% but less than 6%.<br>
(J)<br>
The slider according to the first embodiment was manufactured via a semi-molten die casting<br>
step, a heat treatment step, a finishing step, and a partial heat treatment step, but such a slider<br>
may be manufactured via a metal-mold casting molding step, a heat treatment step, a<br>
finishing step, and a partial heat treatment step. The raw materials may be the same.<br>
In the metal-mold casting step, a raw material liquefied by high-temperature heating is<br>
poured into a cast mold space 303 formed by a fixed mold 302 and a movable mold 301, as<br>
shown in FIG. 26. Thereafter, the liquid raw material inside the cast mold space 303 is<br>
rapidly cooled via the fixed mold 302 and the movable mold 301. At this point, the liquid<br>
raw material inside the cast mold space 303 solidifies to become a solid molded material 310.<br>
In this case, the molded material 310 undergoes heat contraction. For this reason, the<br>
molded material 310 can be readily released from the mold. The unnecessary portions of<br>
the solid molded material 310 are thereafter cut away (hereinbelow, the cut molded material<br>
310 is referred to as a preform material 301a). Next, the preform material 301a is heat<br>
treated in the heat treatment step, and the hardness of the material is adjusted to be greater<br>
than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. At this point, the target hardness may be set to a range<br>
of HRB 90 to HRB 95. In the final finishing step, the preform material 301a that has<br>
undergone the heat treatment step is finely machined to form a final product 310b. In the<br>
present modified example, the heat treatment step and the final finishing step are carried out<br>
in the same manner as the heat treatment step and the final finishing step according to the<br>
first embodiment.<br>
(K)<br>
In the first embodiment, mutually facing convexities 71a and 72a form concavities from the<br>
two sides, above and below, in the end plate 24a to reduce the thickness of the end plate 24a,<br>
 <br>
as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, when the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24 is molded.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited thereby.<br>
As a modified example of the first embodiment, the portion corresponding to the end plate<br>
may be depressed only from the top side, as shown in FIG. 27, for example. The portion<br>
corresponding to the end plate portion may be depressed only from the bottom side, as shown<br>
in FIG. 28, whereby the portion corresponding to the end plate may be molded so as be have a<br>
prescribed thickness t2 (e.g., 4 mm or less). Either of these cases reduces the occurrence of<br>
blowholes CN in the same manner as in the first embodiment.<br>
(L)<br>
In the first embodiment, a space between a second mold portion 82 and a convexity 81a in<br>
which an internal space 26f of the bearing portion 26c is formed is set to a prescribed<br>
distance (e.g., 4 mm or less) when the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 is molded, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, whereby the thickness tl in the center portion of the portion<br>
corresponding to the end plate is brought via the molding process to a prescribed level (e.g., 4<br>
mm or less). However, the present invention is not limited thereby.<br>
As a modified example of the first embodiment, it is also possible to consider a case in which,<br>
e.g., a discharge hole 26h is formed in the end plate 26a of the movable scroll 26, as shown in<br>
FIG. 29, instead of a discharge hole 41 being in the fixed scroll 24. When the movable<br>
scroll 26 having such a discharge hole 26h is manufactured, convexities that face each other<br>
are provided to the first mold portion 81 and the second mold portion 82 of the metal mold 80<br>
(see FIG. 11) for manufacturing the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26, in the same<br>
manner as the metal mold 70 for manufacturing the preform 124 of the fixed scroll 24.<br>
Semi-molten die casting can be carried out using a metal mold 80 having such opposing<br>
convexities. By molding in such a manner, the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 having<br>
a thin opening formation area R is formed in the vicinity of the center of the portion<br>
corresponding to the end plate such as those shown in FIGS. 30 and 31. In this case, the<br>
occurrence of blowholes CN is reduced and the likelihood that a blowhole CN inside the<br>
preform 126 will be exposed to the exterior is eliminated when a discharge hole is formed in<br>
the opening formation area R by drilling.<br>
Here, in the case of the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 in FIG. 30, the opening<br>
formation area R is made thinner by depressing the portion corresponding to the end plate<br>
from above and setting the height of the bottom of the internal space 26f of the bearing<br>
portion 26c to be slightly higher than that of the existing movable scroll in the lower side of<br>
the portion that corresponds to the end plate. The occurrence of blowholes CN can thereby<br>
 <br>
be reduced.<br>
In the case of the preform 126 of the movable scroll 26 of FIG. 31, the height of the bottom of<br>
the internal space 26f is set to be about the same as that of the existing movable scroll, and<br>
the opening formation area R is made thinner by enlarging the concavity of the portion<br>
corresponding to the end plate from above. The occurrence of blowholes CN can thereby be<br>
reduced.<br>
(M)<br>
A notched portion SC5 was formed by an end mill or the like in the movable scroll 26<br>
according to the first embodiment, but a notched portion (counterbore) SC5 may be also<br>
formed in advance in the semi-molten die casting step in the upper surface of the center<br>
portion of the end plate 26a of the movable scroll 26 shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.<br>
In such a case, the notched portion (counterbore) SC5 and the internal space 26f of the<br>
bearing portion 26c are formed at the same time, the thickness of the center portion of the<br>
portion corresponding to the end plate is made thinner, and the occurrence of blowholes CN<br>
is further reduced.<br>
Also, labor can be reduced and shavings are not produced because the notched portion<br>
(counterbore) SC5 is not required to be formed by cutting with an end mill or the like after<br>
semi-molten die casting, in the same manner as in the method for manufacturing the movable<br>
scroll 26 according to the first embodiment.<br>
(N)<br>
In the first embodiment, an iron material was used as the raw material of the slider, but a<br>
metal material other than iron may be used as long as the material does not depart from the<br>
spirit of the present invention.<br>
(0)<br>
In the first embodiment, the suction capacity is increased by a factor of about 1.5 using the<br>
fixed scroll 24 and movable scroll 26 in which the wraps 24b, 26b having a thickness T that is<br>
less than a conventional fixed scroll 324 and movable scroll 326 are adopted, as shown in FIG.<br>
18(b). However, it is also possible to reduce the thickness of the wrap of only one of the<br>
scrolls. For example, in the case that the movable scroll 26 of the first embodiment and the<br>
conventional fixed scroll 324 are combined, the suction capacity can be increased by about<br>
1.25 times higher than conventionally possible, as shown in FIG. 32(b).<br>
Second embodiment<br>
A compressor in which the slider according to a second embodiment is used will be<br>
described using a high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor as an example. The<br>
 <br>
high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor of the second embodiment is one in which<br>
the outer drive-type movable scroll 26 of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor<br>
1 of the first embodiment is substituted with an inner drive-type movable scroll. Therefore,<br>
only the movable scroll will be described below.<br>
(Configuration of the movable scroll)<br>
The movable scroll 96 is primarily composed of an end plate 96a, a scroll (involute shape)<br>
wrap 96b that extends upward from the end surface 96P of the end plate 96a, a bearing<br>
portion 96c that extends downward from the lower surface of the end plate 96a, and a groove<br>
portion 96d formed in the two ends of the end plate 96a, as shown in FIG. 33.<br>
The movable scroll 96 is an inner drive-type movable scroll. In other words, the movable<br>
scroll 96 has a bearing portion 96c that fits inside a concave portion formed in the distal end<br>
of the crankshaft 17.<br>
The vicinity of the center of the end plate 96a is formed to a thickness t3 that is less than the<br>
thickness of the other portions (e.g., the portion near the periphery of the end plate 96a), as<br>
shown in FIG. 33. In other words, a cored concave portion 96f cored during semi-molten<br>
die casting is formed inside the bearing portion 96c. Therefore, the occurrence of blowholes<br>
CN (see FIG. 34) in the portion corresponding to the end plate in the preform 196 is reduced.<br>
The thickness t3 in the vicinity of the center of the portion corresponding to the bearing unit<br>
is set to 4 mm or less in the preform 196.<br>
The thickness of the bearing portion 96c is such that the thickness t4 would increase<br>
considerably without the cored concave portion 96f, and blowholes CN would more readily<br>
occur inside the bearing portion 96c. The thickness t5 of the bearing portion 96c is reduced<br>
because of the presence of the cored concave portion 96f. Therefore, the occurrence of<br>
blowholes CN inside the bearing portion 96c is reduced and a reduction in the strength of the<br>
bearing portion 96c limited. The thickness t5 of the bearing portion 96c is set to 4 mm or<br>
less.<br>
(Molding of the movable scroll)<br>
A mold 90 for the semi-molten die casting of the preform 196 of the movable scroll 96 is<br>
composed of a first mold portion 91 and a second mold portion 92, as shown in FIG. 34.<br>
The shape of a space portion 93 that is formed when the first mold portion 91 and the second<br>
mold portion 92 are combined corresponds to the shape of the external appearance of the<br>
preform 196 of the movable scroll 96 to be molded.<br>
A convexity 91a for forming a cored concave portion 96f of the bearing portion 96c of the<br>
movable scroll 96 is formed in the first mold portion 91. The spacing between the<br>
 <br>
convexity 91a and the second mold portion 92 is set to 4 mm or less. Therefore, the<br>
thickness t3 in the center portion 96e of the end plate 96a is reduced to 4 mm or less.<br>
A preform 196 of the movable scroll 96 having a thickness t3 in the center portion of the<br>
portion that corresponds to the end plate of 4 mm or less can be manufactured by the<br>
semi-molten die casting of iron or another metal material using the mold 90 configured in the<br>
manner described above.<br>
(Characteristics of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor according to second<br>
embodiment)<br>
(1)<br>
In the second embodiment, a cored concave portion 96f is formed in at least a portion of the<br>
interior of a bearing portion 96c with the aid of a concave portion 91a of a mold 90 when a<br>
preform 196 of a movable scroll 96 is formed by semi-molten die casting, and a center<br>
portion of the portion that corresponds to the end plate of the preform 196 of the movable<br>
scroll 96 is thereby formed to be 4 mm or less. As a result, the occurrence of blowholes CN<br>
in the movable scroll 96 is reduced.<br>
The cored concave portion 96f is formed in the bearing portion 96c of the movable scroll 96,<br>
whereby the weight of the movable scroll 96 can be considerably reduced and the movable<br>
scroll 96 can be made more lightweight.<br>
(2)<br>
In the second embodiment, the cored concave portion 96f is formed in the portion<br>
corresponding to the bearing portion of the preform 196 of the movable scroll 96, whereby<br>
the portion that corresponds to the bearing portion is formed to be 4 mm or less. As a result,<br>
the occurrence of blowholes CN in the bearing portion 96c is reduced, and degradation in<br>
strength of the bearing portion 96c is also reduced.<br>
Third embodiment<br>
A compressor in which the slider according to a third embodiment is used will be described<br>
below using a high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor as an example. The<br>
difference between the high-iow pressure dome-type compressor of the third embodiment and<br>
the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor of the first embodiment is the shape of<br>
the wrap of the fixed scroll and the movable scroll. Therefore, only the fixed scroll and the<br>
movable scroll will be described below.<br>
A preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 according to the third embodiment is formed by<br>
semi-molten die casting using a mold 180 shown in FIG. 35, for example.<br>
A specific description is provided below.<br>
 <br>
The mold 180 for semi-molten die casting the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 is<br>
composed of a first mold portion 181 and a second mold portion 182, as shown in FIG. 35.<br>
The shape of a space portion 183 that is formed when the first mold portion 181 and the<br>
second mold portion 182 are combined together corresponds to the shape of the external<br>
appearance of the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 to be molded.<br>
The mold 180 is provided with a wrap mold portion 182a. The wrap mold portion 182a has<br>
an external shape that is set so that the draft angle of the portion Q0 where winding starts near<br>
the center of the wrap-corresponding portion of the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 is<br>
greater than the draft angle of the portion Q4 where winding ends at the outer side (see draft<br>
angles 91, 92 of the movable scroll 26 of the FIG. 36).<br>
The side surface 182b and the side surface 182c of the wrap mold portion 182a have a portion<br>
Q1 that is nearer to the center than the portion Q3 between the portion Q1 and portion Q3 of<br>
the wrap-corresponding portion, as shown in FIGS. 35 and 36, for example. Therefore, the<br>
draft angle 91 of the portion Q1 is set so as to be greater than the draft angle 93 of the portion<br>
Q3 on the outer side.<br>
The preform 626 is made into the movable scroll 526 via a finishing step. The shape of the<br>
wrap of the movable scroll 526 is described below.<br>
In the movable scroll 526, the shape of the scroll of the wrap 526b has a draft angle in the<br>
portion Q10 where winding starts near the center. This angle is greater than the draft angle<br>
of the portion Q14 where winding ends at the outer side, as shown in FIGS. 37 and 38, and<br>
the draft angle from where winding starts to where winding ends is set so as to gradually and<br>
continuously change. Specifically, the portion Q11 of the wrap 526b where winding starts is<br>
set to be a maximum draft angle (e.g., 2 degrees), the draft angle in the intermediate portions<br>
(Q11 to Q13) is set so as to continuously decrease as the winding angle a changes, and the<br>
draft angle of the portion Q14 where winding ends is set to the minimum angle (e.g., 0.5<br>
degree). In other words, the relationship between the winding angle a and the draft angle θ<br>
of the wrap is set so that the draft angle θ has the maximum value of 2 degrees when the<br>
winding angle a is the angle where winding starts, the draft angle θ decreases in proportion to<br>
the increase the winding angle a, and the draft angle θ has the minimum value of 0.5 degree<br>
when the winding angle a is the angle where winding ends, as shown in the graph of FIG. 39.<br>
The fixed scroll 524 is manufactured in the same manner as the movable scroll 526. The<br>
shape of the wrap of the movable scroll after the finishing step is described below.<br>
In the fixed scroll 524, the shape of the scroll of the wrap 524b has a draft angle in the<br>
portion PO where winding starts near the center. The draft angle is greater than the draft<br>
 <br>
angle of the portion P4 where winding ends at the outer side, as shown in FIGS. 40 and 41,<br>
and the draft angle from where winding starts to where winding ends is set so as to gradually<br>
and continuously change. Specifically, the portion PO of the wrap 524b where winding<br>
starts is set to be a maximum draft angle (e.g., 2 degrees), the draft angle in the intermediate<br>
portions (P1 to P3) is set so as to continuously decrease as the winding angle a changes, and<br>
the draft angle of the portion P4 where winding ends is set to the minimum angle (e.g., 0.5<br>
degree). In other words, the relationship between the winding angle a and the draft angle θ<br>
of the wrap is set so that the draft angle θ has the maximum value of 2 degrees when the<br>
winding angle a is the angle where winding starts, the draft angle 0 decreases in proportion to<br>
the increase the winding angle a, and the draft angle θ has the minimum value of 0.5 degree<br>
when the winding angle a is the angle where winding ends, as shown in the graph of FIG. 39.<br>
(Characteristics of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor according to<br>
third embodiment)<br>
(1)<br>
In the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 according to the third embodiment, the draft<br>
angle in relation to the mold in the wrap-corresponding portion varies in accordance with the<br>
winding angle of the wrap-corresponding portion according to the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the shape of the wrap is determined in accordance with strength and quality, and<br>
wasted material can be eliminated.<br>
(2)<br>
In the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 in the third embodiment, the scroll shape of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion is set so that the draft angle in the portion Q0 where winding<br>
starts near the center of the wrap-corresponding portion is greater than the draft angle of the<br>
portion Q4 where winding ends at the outer side, and so that the draft angle gradually and<br>
continuously changes from where winding starts in the center of the wrap-corresponding<br>
portion to the location where winding ends. Therefore, the stress applied to the mold in the<br>
vicinity of the center of the scroll during mold release is reduced when the preform 626 of the<br>
movable scroll 526 is molded by semi-molten die casting. As a result, normal cracking can<br>
be reduced and the service life of the mold can be extended. Therefore, the mold costs can<br>
be reduced and manufacturing costs of the fixed scroll 24 and movable scroll 26 can be<br>
curtailed in association therewith.<br>
(3)<br>
In the third embodiment, the draft angle in the portion Q0 where winding starts near the<br>
center of the wrap-corresponding portion of the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 is<br>
 <br>
greater than the draft angle of the portion Q4 where winding ends at the outer side. For this<br>
reason, the adverse effect on the near-net shaping of the wrap overall (i.e., molding<br>
approximate to the final shape) can be reduced even if the draft angle in the center portion of<br>
the wrap-corresponding portion is increased.<br>
In other words, when the draft angle for the entire wrap-corresponding portion is increased,<br>
the stress applied to the mold in the wrap-corresponding portion overall is reduced during<br>
mold release, but the adverse effect on near-net shaping is increased. However, in the third<br>
embodiment, the adverse effect on the near-net shaping is reduced by increasing the draft<br>
angle in the vicinity of the center of the wrap-corresponding portion to be greater than the<br>
draft angle of the portion where winding ends at the outer side.<br>
(Modified example of third embodiment)<br>
(A)<br>
In the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 according to the third embodiment, the draft<br>
angle is set so as to gradually and continuously change from where winding starts in the<br>
center of the wrap-corresponding portion to the location where winding ends, but the present<br>
invention is not limited to this configuration. The change in the draft angle θ in relation to<br>
the winding angle a of the wrap-corresponding portion may be set so that the rate of decrease<br>
in the draft angle θ is greater in a range near where winding starts, as shown in the graph of<br>
FIG. 42, and so that the rate of decrease of the draft angle 0 is reduced in a range near where<br>
winding ends (the maximum value of the draft angle 0 is 2 degrees, and the minimum value is<br>
0.5 degree). In this case as well, stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of<br>
the scroll is reduced during mold release, and the service life of the mold is extended when<br>
the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 is molded by semi-molten die casting.<br>
In the case of the change in the draft angle 0 in relation to the winding angle a of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion shown in the graph of FIG. 42, the draft angle 0 is set to be a low<br>
angle in portions other than the portions where winding starts and winding ends, in<br>
comparison with the case of the graph of FIG. 39 (change in which the draft angle 0 decreases<br>
in linear fashion in proportion to an increase in winding angle a). Therefore, any adverse<br>
effect on near-net shaping of the wrap-corresponding portion overall can be further reduced.<br>
(B)<br>
In the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 according to the third embodiment, the shape of<br>
the wrap-corresponding portion is set so that the draft angle gradually and continuously<br>
changes from where winding starts to where winding ends, but the present invention is not<br>
limited to this configuration. The change in the draft angle θ in relation to the winding<br>
 <br>
angle a of the wrap-corresponding portion may be set so that the draft angle 9 decreases in a<br>
stepwise fashion from where winding starts to where winding ends, as shown in the graph of<br>
FIG. 43 (the maximum value of the draft angle 9 is 2 degrees, and the minimum value is 9.5<br>
degrees). In this case as well, stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the center of the<br>
scroll is reduced during mold release, and the service life of the mold is extended when the<br>
preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 is molded by semi-molten die casting. Also, the<br>
setting of the draft angle 9 in a range of individual winding angles a of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion is facilitated.<br>
(C)<br>
In the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 according to the third embodiment, the shape of<br>
the wrap-corresponding portion is set so that the draft angle from where winding starts to<br>
where winding ends gradually and continuously changes, but the present invention is not<br>
limited to this configuration. The change in the draft angle 9 in relation to the winding<br>
angle a of the wrap-corresponding portion is set so that the draft angle 9 in a prescribed range<br>
of winding angles a near where winding starts has the maximum value (2 degrees), and so<br>
that the draft angle 9 in other angle ranges is set to the minimum value (9.5 degree), as shown<br>
in the graph of FIG. 44. In this case as well, stress applied to the mold in the vicinity of the<br>
center of the scroll is reduced during mold release, and the service life of the mold is<br>
extended when the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 is molded by semi-molten die<br>
casting. Also, any adverse effect on near-net shaping of the wrap-corresponding portion<br>
overall can be further reduced.<br>
(D)<br>
Although not particularly mentioned in the third embodiment, the surface of the scroll may be<br>
coated with a resin. For example, leakage of refrigerant gas compressed by a compressor<br>
can be reduced and noise suppressed when the entire surface of the movable scroll 536 is<br>
coated with a resin RS in the manner shown in FIG. 45. Noise and leakage of the refrigerant<br>
gas can be reduced when at least the wrap 536b of the movable scroll 536 is coated with a<br>
resin RS.<br>
When the scroll is coated with a resin in this manner, the strength of the scroll inside the resin<br>
coating can be improved only in required locations by increasing the draft angle of the<br>
portion where winding starts near the center of the wrap 536b.<br>
Furthermore, when the surface of the resin RS is machined by cutting after the wrap 536b of<br>
the movable scroll 536 has been coated with resin RS, the movable scroll 536 can be<br>
machined with good precision to a prescribed external shape.<br>
 <br>
The fixed scroll may be coated with the resin RS in the same manner as the movable scroll<br>
536. In this case as well, noise and leakage of the refrigerant gas can be reduced when at<br>
least the wrap of the fixed scroll is coated with a resin RS.<br>
(E)<br>
In the third embodiment, a compressor scroll is manufactured by semi-molten die casting or<br>
another semi-molten molding method, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the<br>
service life of a mold can be extended in the present invention when the compressor scroll is<br>
one in which the material is injected into the mold and then molded. For example, the<br>
service life of a mold can be extended by making the draft angle in the portion where winding<br>
starts near the center of the wrap of the scroll to be greater than the draft angle of the portion<br>
where winding ends at the outer side, even when the scroll is one in which high-temperature<br>
molten metal material is injected into the mold and then cast.<br>
(F)<br>
In the preform 626 of the movable scroll 526 according to the third embodiment, the draft<br>
angle of the portion Q0 where winding starts near the center of the wrap-corresponding<br>
portion is greater than the draft angle of the portion Q4 where winding ends at the outer side,<br>
but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the draft angle on the outer side may be<br>
greater.<br>
In other words, in the fixed scroll preform 644 and the movable scroll preform 646, the draft<br>
angle in the portions P23, Q24 where winding ends at the outer side of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion may be greater than the draft angle of the portions P21, Q21<br>
where winding starts near the center, as shown in FIGS. 46 and 47.<br>
This configuration is effective for the case in which the thickness of the external peripheral<br>
portion of the wrap-corresponding portion is thin and precision is difficult to achieve during<br>
machining. For example, since the external peripheral edge of the wrap-corresponding<br>
portion is a cantilever shape, the strength of the external peripheral portion of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion is reduced when the thickness of the entire wrap-corresponding<br>
portion is reduced. For this reason, the external peripheral portion of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion readily deforms during machining. In view of this situation,<br>
precision can be assured by making the draft angle of the external peripheral portion of the<br>
wrap-corresponding portion to be greater than that of the center portion.<br>
The wrap-corresponding portion may be set so that the draft angle from where winding starts<br>
to where winding ends gradually and continuously changes (i.e., continuously increases from<br>
where winding starts near the center to where winding ends at the outer side) in the same<br>
 <br>
manner as in the third embodiment. In this case, the waste of material can be more<br>
effectively eliminated.<br>
The wrap-corresponding portion may also be set so that the draft angle from where winding<br>
starts to where winding ends changes in a stepwise fashion (i.e., increases in a stepwise<br>
fashion from where winding starts near the center to where winding ends at the outer side) in<br>
the same manner as in the modified example (B) of the third embodiment. In this case, the<br>
waste of material can be more effectively eliminated.<br>
In a prescribed angle range between where winding starts to where winding ends (i.e., a<br>
prescribed range near the portion where winding ends), the wrap-corresponding portion may<br>
be set so that the draft angle is greater than the draft angle in other angle ranges in the same<br>
manner as in the modified example (C) of the third embodiment. In this case, the waste of<br>
material can be more effectively eliminated.<br>
At least the wrap-corresponding portion may be coated with a resin in the same manner as in<br>
the modified example (D) of the third embodiment. In this case, noise and leakage of the<br>
gas refrigerant can be reduced.<br>
Fourth embodiment<br>
A compressor in which the slider according to a fourth embodiment is used will be described<br>
below using a high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor as an example. The<br>
difference between the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor of the fourth<br>
embodiment and the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor of the first embodiment<br>
is the shape of the wrap of the fixed scroll and the movable scroll. Therefore, only the fixed<br>
scroll and the movable scroll will be described below.<br>
A movable scroll preform 726 according to the fourth embodiment is formed by semi-molten<br>
die casting using a mold 280 shown in FIG. 48, for example.<br>
A specific description is provided below.<br>
The mold 280 for the semi-molten die casting of the movable scroll preform 726 is composed<br>
of a first mold portion 281 and a second mold portion 282, as shown in FIG. 48. The shape<br>
of a space portion that is formed when the first mold portion 281 and the second mold portion<br>
282 are combined together corresponds to the shape of the external appearance of the<br>
movable scroll preform 726 to be molded. In the wrap-corresponding portion of the second<br>
mold portion 282 of the mold 280, the external shape is set so as to maintain the required<br>
draft angle when the movable scroll preform 726 is released from the mold 280.<br>
Specifically, the shape of the wrap-corresponding portion of the second mold portion 282 is<br>
determined so that the entire surface of the wrap-corresponding portion 87 is sloped at the<br>
 <br>
first angle 6 with respect to a line orthogonal to the portion 86a corresponding to the end plate.<br>
The thickness of the wrap-corresponding portion 87 of the movable scroll preform 726 in the<br>
boundary with the portion 86a corresponding to the end plate is t + t1 + t1, where t is the<br>
thickness of the distal end.<br>
The fixed scroll preform 724 is also manufactured in the same manner as the movable scroll<br>
preform 726.<br>
The fixed scroll preform 724 and the movable scroll preform 726 molded by semi-molten die<br>
casting are further machined by cutting, whereby the final fixed scroll 734 and movable scroll<br>
736 to be incorporated into a compressor are formed.<br>
The fixed scroll 734 shown in FIG. 49 is manufactured by machining the fixed scroll preform<br>
724 shown in FIGS. 50 and 51. A cutting operation for forming a wrap 185 from the wrap<br>
85 will be described at this point. This operation is one of the machining processes that may<br>
be used. These processes also include drilling of a discharge hole 741.<br>
In this case, the wrap 85 is differentiated into surfaces OS85a, IS85b, OS85b, which are in<br>
close contact with the wrap 187 of the movable scroll 36 as the other element of the meshing<br>
pair and which can form an. end portion of the compression chamber 740, and into an internal<br>
peripheral surface IS85a of the portion 85a where winding starts (portion near the center of<br>
the wrap 85), which is not in close contact with the wrap 187 of the movable scroll 736 as the<br>
other element of the meshing pair. The former surfaces OS85a, IS85b, OS85b are machined<br>
by cutting, and the latter surface IS85a is not machined by cutting. Among the surfaces<br>
OS85a, IS85b, OS85b, the external peripheral surface OS85a of the portion 85a is near where<br>
winding starts; and the internal peripheral surface IS85b and the external peripheral surface<br>
OS85b of the portion 85b are nearer to where winding ends than the portion 85a near where<br>
winding starts. The surfaces OS85a, IS85b, OS85b are machined by cutting in an end mill<br>
process, the slopes shown in FIGS. 50 and 51 are removed, and the surfaces OS 185a, IS 185b,<br>
OS 185b shown in FIGS. 49 and 52 are formed. The surfaces OS85a, IS85b, OS85b<br>
indicated by the broken lines in FIG. 52 are cut, and the surfaces OS 185a, IS 185b, OS185b<br>
indicated by solid lines are formed. The slope angle of the surfaces OS 185a, IS185b,<br>
OS 185b in relation to the line orthogonal to the end plate surface 184a is 0 degrees. On the<br>
other hand, the internal peripheral surface IS85a of the portion 85a of the wrap 85 near where<br>
winding starts is left unchanged as the internal peripheral surface of the portion 185a near<br>
where winding starts in the final wrap 185 as well. FIG. 53 shows an enlarged view of the<br>
portion 185a near where winding starts in FIG. 52. In the portion 185a of the wrap 185 near<br>
where winding starts, the external peripheral surface OS 185a is orthogonal to the end plate<br>
 <br>
surface 184a, whereas the internal peripheral surface IS85a slopes by a first angle 0 with<br>
respect to the line orthogonal to the end plate surface 184a. The portion 85a of the wrap 185<br>
near where winding starts is thereby given a thickness ta in the boundary with the end plate<br>
surface 184a, and this thickness is greater than that of the other portions 85b of the wrap 185.<br>
The portions 85b of the wrap 185 other than the portion 85a near where winding starts are<br>
machined by cutting so as to have the same thickness from the boundary with the end plate<br>
surface 184a to the distal end, and the thickness is set to be the same as the thickness t of the<br>
distal end of the portion 85a near where winding starts shown in FIG. 53.<br>
The movable scroll 736 shown in FIG. 54 is manufactured by machining the movable scroll<br>
preform 726 shown in FIG. 48. Among the machining processes, the cutting operation for<br>
forming a wrap 187 from the wrap 87 will be described at this point.<br>
In this case, the wrap 87 is differentiated into surfaces OS87a, IS87b, OS87b, which are in<br>
close contact with the wrap 185 of the fixed scroll 734 as the other element of the meshing<br>
pair and which can form an end portion of the compression chamber 740, and into an internal<br>
peripheral surface IS87a of the portion 87a where winding starts (portion near the center of<br>
the wrap 87), which is not in close contact with the wrap 185 of the fixed scroll 734 as the<br>
other element of the meshing pair. The former surfaces OS87a, IS87b, OS87b are machined<br>
by cutting, and the latter surface IS87a is not machined by cutting. Among the surfaces<br>
OS87a, IS87b, OS87b, the external peripheral surface OS87a of the portion 87a is near where<br>
winding starts; and the internal peripheral surface IS87b and the external peripheral surface<br>
OS85b of the portion 87b are nearer to where winding ends than the portion 87a near where<br>
winding starts. The surfaces OS87a, IS87b, OS87b are machined by cutting in an end mill<br>
process, the slopes shown in FIG. 48 are removed, and the surfaces OS187a, IS187b, OS187b<br>
shown in FIG. 54 are formed. The surfaces OS87a, IS87b, OS87b indicated by the broken<br>
lines in FIG. 54 are cut, and the surfaces OS 187a, IS187b, OS187b indicated by solid lines<br>
are formed. The slope angle of the surfaces OS187a, IS187b, OS187b in relation to the line<br>
orthogonal to the end plate surface 186a is 0 degrees. On the other hand, the internal<br>
peripheral surface IS87a of the portion 87a of the wrap 87 near where winding starts is left<br>
unchanged as the internal peripheral surface of the portion 187a near where winding starts in<br>
the final wrap 187 as well. In the portion 187a of the wrap 187 near where winding starts,<br>
the external peripheral surface OS 187a is orthogonal to the end plate surface 186a, whereas<br>
the internal peripheral surface IS87a slopes by a first angle θ with respect to the line<br>
orthogonal to the end plate surface 186a. The portion 87a of the wrap 187 near where<br>
winding starts is thereby given a thickness ta in the boundary with the end plate surface 186a,<br>
 <br>
and this thickness is greater than that of the other portions 87b of the wrap 187. The<br>
portions 87b of the wrap 187 other than the portion 87a near where winding starts are<br>
machined by cutting so as to have the same thickness from the boundary with the end plate<br>
186a to the distal end, and the thickness is set to the thickness t, which is less than the<br>
thickness ta, as shown in FIG. 54.<br>
(Movement of the scroll during compression operation)<br>
FIGS. 55 to 57 are diagrams showing a state in which a gas refrigerant is compressed in<br>
association with variation in the capacity of the compression chamber 740. FIGS. 55 to 57<br>
are lateral cross-sectional views of the meshing portion of the wrap 185 of the fixed scroll<br>
734 and the wrap 187 of the movable scroll, and are views from above. The movable scroll<br>
736 turn with respect to the fixed scroll 734, whereby the state changes in the sequence of<br>
FIGS. 55(a), 55(b), 56(a), 56(b), 57(a), and 57(b). The internal peripheral surfaces IS85a,<br>
IS87a of the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185, 187 near where winding starts (surfaces<br>
with thick lines in the diagrams; see FIG. 58) are surfaces that do not make contact with the<br>
counterpart wrap, do not constitute end portions of the compression chamber 740, and do not<br>
contribute to compression work. Therefore, although these surfaces are sloped at a first<br>
angle θ, the surface precision of the surfaces IS85a and IS87a does not affect the airtightness<br>
of the compression chamber 740.<br>
(Characteristics of the high-low pressure dome-type scroll compressor according to fourth<br>
embodiment)<br>
(1)<br>
Using ductile cast iron and high-carbon steel, which are high-strength materials, makes it<br>
difficult to achieve a near-net shape and results in low machinability. Therefore, the scroll<br>
in a conventional scroll compressor is often manufactured using FC250 or another ordinary<br>
cast iron.<br>
In contrast, in the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, the fixed scroll preform<br>
724 and the movable scroll preform 726 are molded by semi-molten die casting, whereby<br>
high strength and high rigidity are achieved and the final fixed scroll 734 and movable scroll<br>
736 are molded to a near-net shape.<br>
However, the scroll preforms 724, 726, which are semi-molten die cast materials, are given<br>
higher strength by heat treatment, but the rigidity (Young's modulus) is fixed and cannot be<br>
adjusted. Therefore, the amount of deformation (flexing) of the wraps 185, 187 during<br>
operation increases when the wraps 185, 187 are merely made thinner as strength is increased,<br>
and noise and abrasion tend to be generated. When the gap between the two wraps 185, 187<br>
 <br>
is increased so as to allow a considerable amount of deformation in order to avoid this noise<br>
and abrasion, airtightness of the compression chamber is reduced and compression<br>
performance is degraded.<br>
In order to avoid these drawbacks, it is possible to consider increasing the rigidity of the<br>
wraps 185, 187 overall by increasing the thickness of the base portion of the portion near the<br>
end plates 184, 186 and reducing the thickness of the distal end portion, rather than merely<br>
reducing the thickness of the wraps 185, 187. However, demerits occur in that the capacity<br>
of the compression chamber is reduced when the thickness of the base portion is increased<br>
overall. Also, it is possible that quality control (control of surface precision) will be made<br>
more difficult and performance will be compromised by leaving a slope on the wraps 185,<br>
187 in which high precision is required.<br>
In view of the above, in the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, a slope having a<br>
first angle 0 is provided to the surfaces IS85a, IS87a of the internal peripheral side to increase<br>
strength and to considerably reduce the amount of deformation in the portions 185a, 187a<br>
near where winding starts in the wraps 185, 187. In these wraps, there is an increase in the<br>
pressure applied by the refrigerant gas compressed near the center. On the other hand, the<br>
slope is eliminated from the portions 185b, 187b that are set at a distance from the center of<br>
the wraps 185, 187, and a reduction in capacity is avoided. Also, the external peripheral<br>
surfaces OS 185a, OS187a of the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185, 187 near where<br>
winding starts are surfaces that make contact with the counterpart scroll and that perform<br>
compression work. The slope is eliminated because control of the surface precision<br>
becomes difficult when a large slope is provided, and refrigerant gas leakage is likely to<br>
increase in the contact portions of the two scrolls 734, 736. A slope having a first angle 0<br>
is provided to the internal peripheral surfaces IS85a, IS87a of the portions 185a, 187a of the<br>
wraps 185, 187 near where winding starts, but there is no demerit because these surfaces<br>
IS85a, IS87a are not surfaces that make contact with a counterpart: scroll and does not affect<br>
the airtightness of the compression chamber 740.<br>
In this manner, in the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, the pressure is<br>
relatively low in the portions 185b, 187b other than the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185,<br>
187 near where winding starts. Therefore, priority is placed on increasing capacity rather<br>
than increasing strength and reducing the amount of deformation, and the slope angle is set to<br>
zero. The pressure is relatively high in the internal peripheral surfaces IS85a, IS87a of the<br>
portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185, 187 near where winding starts. Therefore, a slope<br>
angle (first angle 0) is provided with the aim of increasing strength and reducing the amount<br>
 <br>
of deformation. In the external peripheral surfaces OS 185a, OS187a of the portions 185a,<br>
187a of the wraps 185, 187 near where winding starts, the slope angle is set to zero with<br>
consideration given to control of the surface precision and the airtightness of the compression<br>
chamber 740. For this reason, the thickness of the wraps 185, 187 is reduced overall and the<br>
capacity is assured, but a slope having a first angle 0 is provided to the portions 185a, 187a<br>
near where winding starts of the wraps 185, 187, which received high-pressure, whereby<br>
strength can be assured and the amount of deformation can be kept within acceptable levels.<br>
There is an advantage in that control of surface precision and airtightness of the compression<br>
chamber 740 are assured because the slope angle is set to zero also for the portions 185b,<br>
187b other than the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185, 187 near where winding starts.<br>
(2)<br>
In the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, all of the surfaces OS 182a, IS 185b,<br>
OS185b, OS187a, IS 187b, OS187b in the scroll 124, 126 have a slope angle of zero, except<br>
for the surfaces IS85a, IS87a, which are provided with a slope having a first angle θ. In this<br>
manner, the surfaces that make contact with the wrap of the meshing counterpart scroll and<br>
perform compression work all have a slope angle of zero. Therefore, control of the surface<br>
precision for these surfaces is facilitated, and there is less of a drawback in which gas<br>
refrigerant leaks from the meshing portion of the wraps 185, 187 of the two scroll 124, 126 to<br>
the compression chamber 740 on the outer side during operation of the compressor.<br>
(3)<br>
In the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, the internal peripheral surfaces IS85a,<br>
IS87a of the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185, 187 near where winding starts are surfaces<br>
that do not make contact with meshing counterpart wraps 187, 185. In view of that fact that<br>
high surface precision is not required for these surfaces, machining by cutting the surfaces<br>
IS85a and IS87a is omitted. Reduced costs can thereby be assured and the time required for<br>
machining by cutting is reduced.<br>
(4)<br>
In the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, the draft angle maintained during<br>
mold release is provided to the preforms 724, 726 of the uncut scrolls 734, 736, and the draft<br>
angle is directly used as the slope of the surfaces IS85a, IS87a of the wraps 185, 187.<br>
Therefore, the surfaces IS85a, IS87a of the wraps 185, 187 are set to the first angle θ without<br>
cutting.<br>
(5)<br>
In the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps<br>
 <br>
185, 187 near where winding starts in the scrolls 734, 736 have internal peripheral surfaces<br>
lS85a, IS87a that are sloped by a first angle 9 with respect to the line orthogonal to the end<br>
plate surfaces 184a, 186a in contrast to the external peripheral surfaces OS 185a, OS187a that<br>
are orthogonal to the end plate surfaces 184a, 186a. The portions 85a, 87a of the wraps 185,<br>
187 near where winding starts have a thickness ta in the boundary with the end plate surfaces<br>
184a, 186a, and this thickness is greater than that of the other portions 85b, 87b of the wraps<br>
185, 187. Strength is therefore increased in the portions 185a, 187a of the wraps 185, 187<br>
near where winding starts in the scrolls 734, 736 of this compressor. Therefore, the scrolls<br>
734, 736 of this compressor can withstand an increase in pressure due to a high pressure<br>
difference even when carbon dioxide or another high-pressure refrigerant is compressed. In<br>
addition, the height of the teeth of the scrolls 734, 736 can be increased by this effect. In<br>
other words, the capacity of the compression chamber 740 can be increased even while the<br>
wraps 185, 187 are reduced in diameter. The trunk casing 11 is reduced in diameter when<br>
the diameter of the compressor can be reduced in this manner. The trunk casing 11 having a<br>
reduced diameter can demonstrate the same compression strength with less thickness than a<br>
conventional trunk casing. Accordingly, the raw material costs and the like of the trunk<br>
casing 11 can be reduced. The diameter of the wraps 185, 187 of the scrolls 734, 736 can<br>
also be reduced. For this reason, the sliding surface area of the thrust portion, which is<br>
subject to rigorous conditions, can be increased.<br>
(6)<br>
In the compressor according to the fourth embodiment, the scrolls 734, 736 are manufactured<br>
by semi-molten die casting. Accordingly, the scrolls 734, 736 have a surface roughness that<br>
is less than that of scrolls obtained by conventional iron casting. For this reason, cracks are<br>
unlikely to occur from the surface of the scrolls 734, 736 even when carbon dioxide or<br>
another high-pressure refrigerant is compressed in this compressor.<br>
(Modified example of fourth embodiment)<br>
In the fourth embodiment, the preforms 724, 726 of the compressor scrolls 734, 736 are<br>
manufactured by semi-molten die casting or another semi-molten molding method, but the<br>
present invention is not limited thereby. For example, only the slope angle of the internal<br>
peripheral surfaces of the portion near where winding starts in the center of the wrap, which<br>
does not make contact with the counterpart scroll during compressor operation, may be<br>
increased, and the capacity of the compression chamber can be increased while reducing the<br>
amount of deformation and increasing the strength. This is true even in the case of a scroll<br>
that has been cast by injecting high-temperature molten metal material into the mold.<br>
 <br>
However, the problem of the deformation amount (flexing) in the portion near where winding<br>
starts in the center of the wrap is mainly considered in the case of a scroll in which relatively<br>
higher rigidity is not desired as much as the desired for higher strength obtained using a<br>
high-strength material. Therefore, the present invention is made more useful in that the<br>
rigidity of this portion alone can be improved.<br>
Fifth embodiment<br>
A compressor in which the slider according to a fifth embodiment is used will be described<br>
below using a swing compressor as an example.<br>
The swing compressor 801 according to the fifth embodiment is a two-cylinder swing<br>
compressor, as shown in FIG. 59, and is primarily composed of a cylindrical airtight<br>
dome-type casing 810, a swing compression mechanism 815, a drive motor 816, a suction<br>
tube 819, a discharge tube 820, and a muffler 860. The swing compressor 801 has an<br>
accumulator (vapor-liquid separator) 895 mounted on the casing 810. The constituent<br>
elements of the swing compressor 801 are described below.<br>
(Details of the constituent elements of the swing compressor)<br>
(1)	Casing<br>
The casing 810 has a substantially cylindrical trunk casing 811, a saucer-shaped upper wall<br>
portion 812 welded in an airtight manner to an upper end of the trunk casing 811, and a<br>
saucer-shaped lower wall portion 813 welded in an airtight manner to a lower end of the<br>
trunk casing 811. Primarily accommodated in the casing 810 are the swing compression<br>
mechanism 815 for compressing a gas refrigerant, and the drive motor 816 disposed above<br>
the swing compression mechanism 815. The swing compression mechanism 815 and the<br>
drive motor 816 are connected by a crankshaft 817 disposed so as to extend in the vertical<br>
direction inside the casing 810.<br>
(2)	Swing compression mechanism<br>
The swing compression mechanism 815 is primarily composed of a crankshaft 817, a piston<br>
821, a bushing 822, a front head 823, a first cylinder block 824, a middle plate 825, a second<br>
cylinder block 826, and a rear head 827, as shown in FIGS. 59 and 61. In the fifth<br>
embodiment, the front head 823, first cylinder block 824, middle plate 825, second cylinder<br>
block 826, and rear head 827 are integrally fastened by a plurality of bolts 890. Also, in the<br>
fifth embodiment, the swing compression mechanism 815 is immersed in lubricating oil L<br>
pooled in the bottom portion of the casing 810, and the lubricating oil L is fed to the swing<br>
compression mechanism 815 by differential pressure. The constituent elements of the swing<br>
compression mechanism 815 will be described in detail below.<br>
 <br>
a)	First cylinder block<br>
A cylinder hole 824a, a suction hole 824b, a discharge channel 824c, a bushing<br>
accommodation hole 824d, and a blade accommodation hole 824e are formed on the first<br>
cylinder block 824, as shown in FIG. 60. The cylinder hole 824a is a cylindrical hole that<br>
passes along the plate thickness direction, as shown in FIGS. 59 and 60. The suction hole<br>
824b passes through the cylinder hole 824a from the external peripheral wall surface. The<br>
discharge channel 824c is formed by notching a portion of an internal peripheral part of the<br>
cylindrical portion that forms the cylinder hole 824a. The bushing accommodation hole<br>
824d is a hole that extends in the plate thickness direction and is disposed between the<br>
suction hole 824b and the discharge channel 824c when viewed in the plate thickness<br>
direction. The blade accommodation hole 824e is a hole that extends in the plate thickness<br>
direction and is in communication with the bushing accommodation hole 824d.<br>
The first cylinder block 824 is fitted into the front head 823 and the middle plate 825 so that<br>
the discharge channel 824c faces the front head 823 in a state in which an eccentric shaft<br>

FIG. 61). As a result, a first cylinder chamber Rc1 is formed on the swing compression<br>
mechanism 815; and the first cylinder chamber Rcl is partitioned by the piston 821 into a<br>
suction chamber that is in communication with the suction hole 824b, and a discharge<br>
chamber that is communication with the discharge channel 824c.<br>
b)	Second cylinder block<br>
A cylinder hole 826a, a suction hole 826b, a discharge channel 826c, a bushing<br>
accommodation hole 826d, and a blade accommodation hole 826e are formed on the second<br>
cylinder block 826 in the same manner as the first cylinder block 824, as shown in FIG. 60.<br>
A cylinder hole 826a is a cylindrical hole that extends in the plate thickness direction, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 59 and 60. The suction hole 826b passes from the external peripheral wall<br>
surface to the cylinder hole 826a. The discharge channel 826c is formed by notching a<br>
portion of an internal peripheral portion of the cylinder part that forms the cylinder hole 826a.<br>
The bushing accommodation hole 826d is a hole that extends in the plate thickness direction<br>
and is disposed between the suction hole 826b and the discharge channel 826c when viewed<br>
in the plate thickness direction. The blade accommodation hole 826e is a hole that extends<br>
in the plate thickness direction and is in communication with the bushing accommodation<br>
 <br>
hole 826d.<br>
The second cylinder block 826 is fitted into the rear head 827 and the middle plate 825 so that<br>
the discharge channel 826c faces the rear head 827 in a state in which an eccentric shaft<br>
portion 817b of the crankshaft 817 and a roller portion 821a of the piston 821 are<br>
accommodated in the cylinder hole 826a, a blade portion 821b of the piston 821 and the<br>
bushing 822 are accommodated in the bushing accommodation hole 826d, and the blade<br>
portion 821b of the piston 821 is accommodated in the blade accommodation hole 826e (see<br>
FIG. 61). As a result, a second cylinder chamber Rc2 is formed on the swing compression<br>
mechanism 815; and the second cylinder chamber Rc2 is partitioned by the piston 821 into a<br>
suction chamber that is in communication with the suction hole 826b, and a discharge<br>
chamber that is communication with the discharge channel 826c.<br>
c)	Crankshaft<br>
The crankshaft 817 has two eccentric shaft portions 817a, 817b provided to one of the end<br>
portions. The two eccentric shaft portions 817a, 817b are formed so that the eccentric axes<br>
face each other across the center axis of the crankshaft 817. The crankshaft 817 is secured<br>
to the rotor 852 of the drive motor 816 on the side in which the eccentric shaft portions 817a,<br>
817b are not provided.<br>
d)	Piston<br>
The piston 821 has a substantially cylindrical roller portion 821a, and a blade portion 821b<br>
that protrudes outward in the radial direction of the roller portion 821a, as shown in FIGS. 59<br>
and 62. The roller portion 821a is fitted into the eccentric shaft portions 817a, 817b of the<br>
crankshaft 817, and is inserted in this state into the cylinder holes 824a, 826a of the cylinder<br>
blocks 824, 826. The roller portion 821a thereby moves in an orbiting fashion about the<br>
rotational axis of the crankshaft 817 when the crankshaft 817 rotates. The blade portion<br>
821b is accommodated in bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d and blade<br>
accommodation holes 824e, 826e. The blade portion 821b thereby swings and<br>
simultaneously moves in a reciprocating fashion in the lengthwise direction.<br>
e)	Bushing<br>
The bushing 822 is a substantially semicylindrical member and is accommodated in the<br>
bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d so as to hold the blade portion 821b of the piston<br>
821 on both sides.<br>
f)	Front head<br>
The front head 823 is a member that covers the first cylinder block 824 on the side of the<br>
discharge channel 824c and is fitted into the casing 810. A bearing portion 823a is formed<br>
 <br>
on the front head 823, and the crankshaft 817 is inserted into the bearing portion 823a. Also,<br>
formed in the front head 823 is an opening 823 b for feeding to the discharge tube 820 a<br>
refrigerant gas that flows in through the discharge channel 824c formed in the first cylinder<br>
block 824. The opening 823b is opened and closed by a discharge valve (not shown) for<br>
preventing the backflow of refrigerant gas.<br>
g) Rear head<br>

826c. A bearing portion 827a is formed on the rear head 827, and the crankshaft 817 is<br>
inserted into the bearing portion 827a. Also, an opening (not shown) for feeding to the<br>
discharge tube 820 a refrigerant gas that flows in through the discharge channel 826c formed<br>
in the second cylinder block 826 is formed in the rear head 827. The opening is opened and<br>
closed by a discharge valve (not shown) for preventing the backflow of refrigerant gas.<br>
h) Middle plate<br>
The middle plate 825 is disposed between the first cylinder block 824 and the second cylinder<br>
block 826, and partitions the first cylinder chamber Rc1 and the second cylinder chamber<br>
Rc2.<br>
(3)	Drive motor<br>
The drive motor 816 is a DC motor in the fifth embodiment, and is primarily composed of an<br>
annular stator 851 secured to the internal wall surface of the casing 810, and a rotor 852<br>
rotatably accommodated with a slight gap (air gap channel) on the inner side the stator 851.<br>
Copper wire is wound about a tooth portion (not shown) of the stator 851, and a coil end 853<br>
is formed above and below the stator. The external peripheral surface of the stator 851 is<br>
provided with core cut portions (not shown) that have been formed as a notch in a plurality of<br>
locations from the upper end surface to the lower end surface of the stator 851 at prescribed<br>
intervals in the peripheral direction.<br>
A crankshaft 817 is secured along the rotational axis to the rotor 852.<br>
(4)	Suction tube<br>

fitted into the suction holes 824b, 826b formed in the first cylinder block 824 and the second<br>
cylinder block 826, and another end that is fitted into the accumulator 895.<br>
(5)	Discharge tube<br>
The discharge tube 820 is provided so as to pass through the upper wall portion 812 of the<br>
casing 810.<br>
(6)	Muffler<br>
 <br>
The muffler 860 is used to muffle the discharge noise of the refrigerant gas, and is mounted<br>
on the front head 823.<br>
(Method for manufacturing a slider)<br>
In the swing compressor 801 according to the fifth embodiment, the cylinder blocks 824, 826,<br>
the piston 821, and the crankshaft 817 are manufactured by the same manufacturing method<br>
as the one used to manufacture the slider of the first embodiment. In this case, the piston<br>
821 and the crankshaft 817 are heat treated in the heat treatment step under conditions at<br>
which the hardness is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100.<br>
In the fifth embodiment, after the finishing step, high-frequency heaters are inserted into the<br>
bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d of the cylinder blocks 824, 826, and the cylinder<br>
blocks 824, 826 are subjected to a high-frequency heating treatment so that the hardness of<br>
the portions on the periphery of the bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d is set to be<br>
greater than HRC 50 but less than HRC 65. The cylinder blocks 824, 826 prior to the<br>
high-frequency heating treatment are heat treated under conditions at which the hardness is<br>
greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100. After finishing, the crankshaft 817 is subjected<br>
to high-frequency heating treatment in the main shaft and secondary shaft portions<br>
accommodated in the front head 823 and the rear head 827.<br>
In the fifth embodiment, after the finishing step, the peripheral portion SC8 of the base of the<br>
blade portion 821b of the piston 821 in which stress is readily concentrated (see FIG. 62; the<br>
partial heating treatment locations are shaded) is subjected to partial heat treatment.<br>
(Operation of the swing compressor)<br>
When the drive motor 816 is driven, the eccentric shaft portions 817a, 817b rotate<br>
eccentrically about the crankshaft 817, and the roller portion 821a fitted into the eccentric<br>
shaft portions 817a, 817b orbits while the external peripheral surface of the roller portion<br>
821a makes contact with the internal peripheral surface of the cylinder chambers Rc1, Rc2.<br>
The blade portion 821b reciprocates while the two side surfaces are held by the bushing 822,<br>
in accompaniment with the orbiting of the roller portion 821a inside the cylinder chambers<br>
Rcl, Rc2. At this point, a low-pressure refrigerant gas is suctioned from the suction port<br>
819 into the suction chamber and is compressed to a high pressure in the discharge chamber,<br>
and the high-pressure refrigerant gas is thereafter discharged from the discharge channels<br>
824c, 826c.<br>
(Characteristics of the swing compressor)<br>
(1)<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 are manufactured<br>
 <br>
via a semi-molten die casting step and a heat treatment step. Accordingly, a cylinder block<br>
and piston can be readily provided with higher tensile strength and hardness than a cylinder<br>
block and piston composed of flake graphite cast iron manufactured using conventional sand<br>
casting (because higher strength and rigidity than FC250 can be achieved by performing heat<br>
treatment).<br>
(2)<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 are manufactured<br>
via a semi-molten die casting step and a heat treatment step, and the hardness of these<br>
components is adjusted so as to be greater than HRB 90 but less than HRJB 100. In this case,<br>
the hardness of the cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 substantially corresponds to a<br>
tensile strength within a range of 600 MPa to 900 MPa. Accordingly, the cylinder blocks<br>
824, 826 and the piston 821 can be made thinner by adopting this method for manufacturing a<br>
compressor slider. Therefore, the swing compressor 801 can be reduced in diameter, and the<br>
abrasion of the cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 can consequently be reduced and<br>
the compression capacity increased.<br>
(3)<br>
In the heat treatment step of the fifth embodiment, the cylinder block preform and the piston<br>
preform are heat treated to a hardness greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100.<br>
Accordingly, when this method for manufacturing a compressor slider is adopted, the<br>
cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 can be manufactured so that sufficient durability<br>
can be demonstrated during compressor operation, "breaking-in" occurs as early as possible,<br>
and seizing during abnormal operation does not occur. When the hardness is in this range,<br>
the machinability of the cylinder block preform and the piston preform is good, the cylinder<br>
block preform and the piston preform are not readily damaged, and handling is facilitated.<br>
Accordingly, tool abrasion and tool chipping is less likely to occur, tool service life is<br>
extended, a built-up edge is less likely to form, grinding processability is good, and<br>
machining costs are reduced because machining time can be reduced. Regardless the scrolls<br>
have superior tool abrasion and machining time because of lower hardness in relation to FCD<br>
having the same tensile strength (tensile strength is high at the same level of hardness), it can<br>
be said that higher tensile strength can be achieved.<br>
(4)<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the cylinder blocks 824, 826 are manufactured by a semi-molten die<br>
casting and a heat treatment step, after which high-frequency heaters are inserted into the<br>
bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d, and hardening is carried out so that the hardness<br>
 <br>
of the portions of the periphery of the bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d is greater<br>
than HRC 50 but less than HRC 65. For this reason, the abrasion of the portions of the<br>
periphery of the bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d is reduced even when CO2 or<br>
another natural refrigerant is suctioned in.<br>
(5)<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the main shaft portion, the secondary shaft portion accommodated in<br>
the front head 823 and the rear head 827, and the eccentric shaft portion of the crankshaft 817<br>
are subjected to high-frequency heating treatment. Accordingly, sufficient abrasion<br>
resistance can be imparted to the main shaft portion, the secondary shaft portion, and the<br>
eccentric shaft portion. Therefore, the service life of the crankshaft 817 can be extended.<br>
(6)<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the peripheral portion SC8 of the base of the blade portion 821b of<br>
the piston 821 in which stress is readily concentrated is partially heat treated. Accordingly,<br>
the piston 821 is not likely to be destroyed even if a somewhat large load is applied to the<br>
blade portion 821b.<br>
(Modified example of fifth embodiment)<br>
(A)<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 were heat treated so<br>
that the hardness of the cylinder blocks 824, 826 and the piston 821 of the swing compressor<br>
801 was greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100, after which high-frequency heaters<br>
were inserted in the bushing accommodation holes 824d, 826d and a hardening treatment was<br>
performed so that the hardness of the portions in the periphery of the bushing accommodation<br>
holes 824d, 826d was made to be greater than HRC 50 but less than HRC 65. In this case,<br>
such a hardness adjustment technique may be applied to a cylinder block 924 and a roller 921<br>
of a rotary compressor 901 such as that shown in FIG. 64. In other words, the roller 921 and<br>
the cylinder block 924 of the rotary compressor 901 are heat treated so that the hardness of<br>
the cylinder block 924 and the roller 921 is greater than HRB 90 but less than HRB 100.<br>
Thereafter, a high-frequency heater is inserted into a vane accommodation hole 924d, and the<br>
cylinder block 924 is subjected to a hardening treatment so that the hardness of the portions<br>
in the periphery of the vane accommodation hole 924d is greater than HRC 50 but less than<br>
HRC 65 (see FIG. 63). A vane 922 may be manufactured using the same method. In FIGS.<br>
63 and 64, the reference numeral 924a indicates a cylinder hole, 924c is a discharge channel,<br>
924b is a suction hole, 917 is a crankshaft, 917a is an eccentric shaft of the crankshaft, 923 is<br>
a spring, and Rc3 is a cylinder chamber. The roller 921 and the cylinder block 924 may be<br>
 <br>
manufactured in accordance with the manufacturing method described in modified example<br>
(H) of the first embodiment.<br>
(B)<br>
The swing compressor 801 according to the fifth embodiment was a two-cylinder swing<br>
compressor, but the swing compressor may also be a single-cylinder swing compressor.<br>
(C)<br>
In the swing compressor 801 according to the fifth embodiment, the cylinder blocks 824, 826<br>
and the piston 821 were manufactured via a semi-molten die casting step and a heat treatment<br>
step, but the crankshaft 817, the front head 823, the rear head 827, the middle plate 825, and<br>
other sliders may be manufactured via the same steps.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
