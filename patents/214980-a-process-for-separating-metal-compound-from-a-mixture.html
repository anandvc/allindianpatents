				<td>Title: Metal removal<br>
The invention is directed to a process for the removal of metal<br>
compounds, such as a catalyst or catalyst remains from liquid reaction<br>
systems. More ir. particular the invention is. directed to the removal of<br>
metal compounds, such as a catalyst or catalyst remains, from<br>
homogeneously catalysed reaction systems.<br>
Metal compounds are applied in a variety of applications, e.g. as<br>
catalysts, colourants or pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>
Catalysts based upon metal complexes, generally comprise at<br>
least one metal compound that at least consists of at least one metal atom<br>
and/or at least one ligand, or at least one metal ion and/or at least one<br>
counter ion and /or at least one ligand. Such catalyst systems are very<br>
effective and selective catalysts in homogeneous catalyst systems for a<br>
broad range of reactions. However, it is often very difficult to remove the<br>
(homogeneous) catalyst or its remains from the reaction mixture after the<br>
reaction has been completed. Quite often (difficult extraction procedures,<br>
recrystallizations, membrane filtrations or distillation steps are necessary<br>
to remove the catalyst or its remains.<br>
Other methods describe a modification of homogeneous catalysts<br>
that simplifies separation from the reaction products. However, such a<br>
modification oi a homogeneous catalyst also changes its catalytic<br>
properties.<br>
Cataysts and/or its remains have to be removed from a process<br>
stream in order to obtain pure products. A simple and efficient method to<br>
purify process streams from catalysts and /or its remains is desirable,<br>
also from an economic and environmental point of view.<br>
US patent 4,413, 118 describes a process in which organic sulfur<br>
compounds containing a carbon-sulfur double bond are used to remove<br>
homogeneous catalyst group VIII metals from chemical process streams.<br>
US patent 4,855,4-00 describes the removal of catalyst residues from<br>
carbon monoxide/olefin polymers with a catalyst completing agent for<br>
palladium. US patent 4,952,304 describes the removal of a group VIII<br>
catalyst and co-catalyst by treating the contaminated product with an<br>
aqueous solution of a silicate, borate or carbonate. The catalyst residues<br>
are extracted in the aqueous layer.<br>
Fedotov et al. descnbe the use of membranes to separate a bulky<br>
homogeneous catalyst from the reaction mixture in Catalysis Letters 1990,<br>
6, 417-422.<br>
US patent 6,303,829 and US patent 6,307,108 describe the use of<br>
fractional countercurrent extraction to remove metal-organophosphorus<br>
complexes from the reaction product fluid. US patent 4,429,057 describes<br>
the removal of volatile precious metal catalysts from a process stream by<br>
selective extraction in alcoholic liquids. US patent 4,950,629 describes the<br>
precipitation of homogeneous catalysts from a reaction solution solvent by<br>
reaction with lower alkanoic acid.<br>
US pater t 6,187,962 describes the separation of a homogeneous<br>
catalyst from a hydroformylation process stream by extraction methods.<br>
US patent 4,353,810 describes the removal of an iron oxidation<br>
catalyst by reaction of the iron catalyst with an iron oxidant material<br>
which will cause the precipitation of the iron catalyst.<br>
Many of the described processes have a lack of efficiency and<br>
only partly remove catalyst residues. Moreover, the additives that are used<br>
contaminate the product mixtures and are difficult to remove from the<br>
process stream. This makes the described methods unattractive from a<br>
process point of view.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process that<br>
does not have all the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
The invention is based on the idea that certain compounds, in<br>
particular hei eropoly acids, have the property to bind very effectively and<br>
selectively with metal compounds i.e. compounds comprising at least one<br>
metal atom or ion such as homogeneous metal catalysts, thereby forming<br>
an insoluble precipitate. These heteropoly acids can also be attached to<br>
supports such as those based on various insoluble oxides and organic<br>
supports.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for<br>
separating at least one metal compound and/or a component thereof from<br>
a mixture, said process comprising contacting the said mixture with a<br>
heteropoly acid or heteropoly acid anion, thereby producing a precipitate<br>
comprising the heteropoly acid or heteropoly acid anion and the metal<br>
compound and/or the component thereof. It will be appreciated that in<br>
general the precipitate is substantially insoluble in the said, mixture<br>
(under the contacting conditions).<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to contact a mixture - generally at<br>
least comprising the metal compound - containing the metal<br>
compound(s), with a heteropoly acid or with a support material modified<br>
with a heteropcly acid, so that the metal compound and/or a component<br>
thereof can be removed from the mixture by separating the resulting solids<br>
from the mixture. This invention provides a tool to efficiently remove metal<br>
compounds, such as catalysts or catalyst remains from a liquid, e.g. a<br>
liquid process stream. The invention is particularly suitable to remove or<br>
recover a homogeneous metal compound or a component thereof dissolved<br>
in a liquid solution, from a liquid solution; further, the invention is<br>
particularly suitable to purify a solution containing a homogenous metal<br>
compound.<br>
The term homogeneous metal compound is used herein to<br>
describe a metal compound dissolved in a solvent, a metal compound<br>
present in a colloidal phase (hereinafter referred to as colloidal metal<br>
compound), a dispersed metal compound, a metal compound in an<br>
emulsion, a metal compound in a sol and in general to describe metal<br>
compounds that are present in a fluid system in a fashion that does not<br>
generally allow the metal and /or metal compound to be readily separated<br>
by filtration from the fluid.<br>
Components of metal compounds that can be separated include<br>
unbound metal moieties, ligands and counter ions.<br>
A mixture from which the metal compound and/or a component<br>
thereof is separated can be any fluid containing said metal compound<br>
and/or component thereof dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise<br>
contained in ssid fluid.<br>
A process according to the invention may be used to achieve a<br>
partial or an essentially complete removal of metal compounds and/or<br>
components thereof such as catalysts or catalyst remains. Of course it is<br>
possible that several types of metal compounds and components are<br>
removed simultaneaously or subsequently in a process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Very good results have been achieved with a method according<br>
to the invention wherein a compound comprising and ionic metal moiety is<br>
removed. It is stressed that the ionic metal moiety can either be anionic<br>
(e.g. Ru-) or cetionic.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the removal of catalysts<br>
and/or remains thereof. A process according to the invention may also be<br>
used to remote or purify other metal compounds, e.g. complexes used as<br>
colourants or metal chelates for pharmaceutical purposes.<br>
The invention may be employed to recover metal compounds or<br>
to purify products such as pharmaceuticals or foodstuffs, that may be<br>
contaminated with metal compounds, such as catalysts or remains thereof<br>
that have leached from a (supported) catalyst into the product.<br>
In an embodiment, the invention is directed to a process for the<br>
removal of at least one homogeneous metal compound (and/or a<br>
component thereof), preferably a dissolved metal compound or a colloidal<br>
metal compound, from a mixture - e.g. a reaction mixture - said process<br>
comprising contacting the said mixture with a heteropoiy acid optionally<br>
anchored to an insoluble support, thereby producing a precipitate. <br>
In an embodiment, the invention is directed to a process for the<br>
purification of a mixture containing at least one homogeneous metal<br>
compound (and /or a component thereof), preferably a dissolved metal<br>
compound or a colloidal metal compound, said process comprising<br>
contacting the said mixture with a heteropoiy acid, optionally anchored to<br>
an insoluble support, thereby producing a precipitate and recovering the<br>
mixture.<br>
In an embodiment, the invention, is directed to a process for the<br>
recovery of at least one homogeneous metal compound (or a component<br>
thereof), preferably a dissolved metal compound or a colloidal metal<br>
compound, e.g a homogeneous metal catalyst from a mixture, said<br>
process comprising contacting the said mixture with a heteropoiy acid,<br>
optionally anchored to an insoluble support, thereby producing a<br>
precipitate that is substantially insoluble in the said mixture and<br>
recovering the metal compound or one or more components thereof from<br>
the said precipitate.<br>
The invention is also embodied in a process for carrying out a<br>
chemical reaction, wherein a reaction mixture, after completion of the<br>
reaction is contacted with a heteropoiy acid, optionally anchored to an<br>
insoluble support.<br>
The present invention comprises an embodiment wherein a<br>
heteropoiy acid or an anion thereof is added to a mixrure, thereby forming<br>
an insoluble precipitate with the metal compound (or with an unbound<br>
atomic or ionic metal moiety), which can be separated from the mixture<br>
using conventional separation techniques. It is assumed that the<br>
heteropoiy acd or anion thereof interacts with the metal species, thereby<br>
forming complex that is insoluble (under the contacting conditions). In<br>
case the metal species is complexed with cne or more ligands, these<br>
ligands will generally stay attached to the metal and will be removed<br>
together with the said insoluble complex. This makes it possible to recover<br>
at least part of the ligands too, which may be important in case the<br>
ligands are expensive and/or contaminate the product mixture.<br>
The invention further comprises an embodiment wherein the<br>
heteropoly acid or anion thereof is bound in some way to a support<br>
material. The same principles apply in that case, but additional<br>
advantages are that the of risk contamination of the mixture with<br>
heteropoly acids or anions is avoided or at least significantly reduced.<br>
Further, it facilitates separation of the metal compound from the process<br>
stream, because liquid-solid separation can readily be employed and it is<br>
possible to separate the mixture and the metal compound attached to the<br>
heteropoly acid in a fixed-bed application.<br>
This invention allows the binding of homogeneous metal<br>
compounds or components thereof, preferably dissolved metal compounds<br>
or colloidal metal compounds - such as homogeneous metal catalyst,<br>
catalyst remains or metal based colour-indicating means - from a<br>
(reaction) mixture. In this respect the terms catalyst and catalyst remains<br>
are both used to indicate all those components that can be present in a<br>
(homogeneously) catalysed reaction mixture. Such a catalyst or catalyst<br>
remains typically at least consists of at least one metal atom and/or at<br>
least one ligand, or at least one metal ion and/or at least one counter ion<br>
and/or at least one ligand. More in particular this includes all catalyst<br>
related components that are present in the (reaction) mixture, such as<br>
precursors of a. catalyst, the active catalyst and the decomposition<br>
products of the catalyst, or catalysts or remains thereof that have leached<br>
from a (supported) catalyst into the reaction mixtures.<br>
The removal may refer to removing at least part of the metal<br>
species, but. also, if applicable, to removing the ligand(s), and/or the<br>
counter ions. When using the term catalyst, it is to be understood, that<br>
this encompasses all said components.<br>
More in particular, the invention is useful for removing metal<br>
complexes, such as catalyst materials, that consists of at least one metal<br>
atom and/or at least one ligand, or at least one metal ion and/or at least<br>
one counter for and/or at least one ligand. Such complexes may be<br>
represented lay the formula Mm(L)nXp wherein M represents a metal atom<br>
or metal ion, preferably a transition metal atom or ion, more preferably<br>
Rh, Ru, Ir, Pd, Pt, Ni or an ion thereof,<br>
wherein each L represents an organic or inorganic molecule with<br>
electron donating properties, preferably a molecule containing one or more<br>
heteroatoms like P, S, N or O or a molecule containing one or more<br>
unsaturated bonds, more preferably a molecule selected from the group<br>
consisting of phosphines, nitrogen and/or oxygen containing ligands (e.g.<br>
acetonitril, CO or HaO), cyclic dienes (e.g. cyclooctadiene (cod)), cyclic<br>
trienes;<br>
wherein m is at least 1;<br>
wherein n is an integer in the range of 0-6;<br>
wherein each X represents an inorganic moiety, preferably<br>
selected from iie group consisting of H-, C1-, BF4-, ClO4-, SbF6-. NO3-, PF6-,<br>
anionic organic molecules and negatively charged complexes of a metal<br>
ion; preferred examples of such negatively charged complexes of a metal<br>
ion include transmition metal ion complexes (e.g. of Rh, Ru, Ir, Pd, Pt, an<br>
actinide, a lanthanide) and complexes of an alkaline earth metal ion;<br>
wherein p is an integer chosen in the range of 0-8.<br>
Dissolved and/or finely and stable dispersed clusters of metal<br>
complexes of the formula M(L)nXp and multimetallic compounds (i.e.<br>
wherein m&gt;1) are included. The compound may comprise more than one<br>
metal moiety, e.g. in the case of a colloidal metal compound.<br>
Particular good results have been, achieved with a process to<br>
remove compounds with a single metal moiety per compound (i.e. m=1).<br>
A couple of examples of metal complexes that can be removed in<br>
a process according to the invention axe the complexes that are obtained<br>
from the precursor complexes [Rh((R,R)-Me-DuPHOS)(COD)]BF4 ((R,R)-Me-<br>
DuPHOS = (-)-1,2-bis((2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene), [Ru((R)-<br>
BINAP)Cl2]2-NE3 (R)-BINAP = (R)-(+)-2,2"-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1"-<br>
binaphtyl, Pd(CAc)2, Rh(CO)(H)(PPh3)3, NiMO3(H2O)6.<br>
Also metal compounds originating from dispersed heterogeneous<br>
materials that have been added to the reaction mixture for catalytic<br>
purposes or other reasons can be removed by a process according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Heteropoly anions are polymeric oxoanions (polyoxometalates)<br>
that may be formed by condensation of two or more kinds of oxoanions.<br>
Heteropoly acids are protonated heteropoly anions. The term heteropoly<br>
compound (HPA) is used for the acid forms and the salts. Unless in <br>
otherwise, the term heteropoly acid is used herein to describe both the<br>
acid form and the salt. Heteropoly anions are composed of oxides of<br>
adenda atoms (V, Nb, Mo, W, etc) and heteroatoms (P, Si etc). The<br>
structures are classified into several groups based on the similarity of the<br>
composition and structure such as Keggin-type, Dawson species, Waugh<br>
species, Anderson species, Silverton species and their lacunar and other<br>
crystalline or non-crystalline forms and anions of the preceding. The<br>
heteropoiy compounds contain one or more strong protons which can<br>
partly or completely be replaced by alkali, alkali earth or quaternary<br>
ammonium ions. Other HPA-related compounds are organic and<br>
organometallic complexes of polyanions. Keggin type heteropoly acids are<br>
preferred in this invention. Keggin-type heteropoly compounds generally<br>
are represented by the formula (XM12O40)m-, wherein X is a heteroatom,<br>
such as P, Si, etc, and wherein M is an addenda atom, such as V, Nb, Mo,<br>
W, etc. Examples of particularly suitable heteropoly acids are<br>
phosphotungstic acid (PTA), phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) and<br>
silicotungstic acid (STA).<br>
As indicated above, the heteropoly acid may be used as such, or<br>
dissolved in a suitable solvent (solvents in which heteropoly acid dissolves<br>
e.g. polar solvents such as alcoholic solvents, H2O) or attached to a<br>
support material. Obviously a mixture of several different heteropoly acids<br>
may be employed in accordance with the invention.<br>
Contact between the supported or unsupported heteropoly acid<br>
or anion generally occurs in a liquid at a temperature of from about -80<br>
degree C to about 250 degree C for a time period of from about 1 min. to<br>
about 50 hrs. Preferably, this occurs at temperatures of between about 20<br>
degree C and about 100 degree C. for a period of between 0.1 and 12<br>
hours.<br>
The ratio metal compound to heteropoly acid may be varied<br>
within a wide range depending upon the required purity of the treated<br>
reaction mixture and the desired speed of the removal process. For many<br>
purposes, e.g. for a complete removal of metal compounds, usually at least<br>
1 equivalent of heteropoly acid is employed; herein, 1 equivalent is defined<br>
as acidic site per metal ion or metal atom.<br>
It is however possible to use a lower amount of heteropoly acid,<br>
e.g. because ccmplete removal is not desired. The amount of heteropoly<br>
acid will typically be at least 0.1 and usually up to 4000 equivalents of<br>
heteropoly acid. Preferably 0.5-1000 equivalents of heteropoly acid are<br>
employed, if it is a goal to remove at least the majority of the metal<br>
compounds. Very suitable is an embodiment wherein 0.75-100<br>
equivalents of one or more heteropoly acids were employed. Very good<br>
results have been achieved with an embodiment wherein 1-50 equivalents<br>
of heteropoly acid are used.<br>
Typically, in a method according to the present invention the<br>
supported heteropoly acid or its anion is present in a weight ratio with the<br>
support of from about 0.01:1 to about 20:1<br>
Suitable support materials are insoluble oxides, organic<br>
supports and combinations thereof. Preferred examples of insoluble oxides<br>
are alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, active<br>
carbons, zeolites, clay materials and combinations thereof. Preferred<br>
organic support; are polymers, oligomers, composites and materials<br>
coated with an organic moiety. The supports may be structured materials,<br>
e.g. shaped materials such as a star shaped material or a maze or applied<br>
to another support such a$ a structured packing (monolith and the like).<br>
The contacting can be done by any method that allows for the<br>
heteropoly acid or anion to be in good contact with the (reaction) mixture.<br>
In case of use of unsupported materials, it can simply be mixed into the<br>
reaction mixture in suitable quantity, followed by separating the insoluble<br>
complex from the liquid. The supported material may be brought into<br>
contact in a suitable way, such as by using a chromatographic method,<br>
using a fixed bed, under slurry reaction conditions or by using structured<br>
packing. After the (reaction) mixture and the solid support have been in<br>
contact, the metal compound, e.g. the catalyst or its remains, can be<br>
removed from the (reaction) mixture by simple filtration, sedimenation,<br>
centrifugation or decantation techniques. The metal compound may be<br>
recovered from the solid material, for example by washing with a solution<br>
containing suitable compounds or by removal of the support by methods<br>
employed in precious metal refinery.<br>
A method according to the invention is particularly suitable for<br>
the removal of a metal catalyst or remains thereof from a reaction mixture,<br>
inter alia because usually the reaction products do not have any chemical<br>
interaction with the supported or unsupported heteropoly acids or anions,<br>
with or without attached homogeneous catalysts, and can be separated<br>
unaffectedly from the supported or unsupported heteropoly acids or<br>
anions, with or without attached homogeneous catalysts. This allows one<br>
to perform a homogeneous metal catalysed reaction and recover/remove<br>
the homogeneous catalyst remains by a simple method. In this way the<br>
catalyst can easiy be recovered and/or a very pure reaction mixture can<br>
be obtained.<br>
In case of the use of the support modified with heteropoiy acids<br>
or anions in a fixed bed application, the reaction mixture that contains the<br>
metal compounc, such as the catalyst or its remains, can be run through<br>
the bed. The metal compound will stick to the solid material and the<br>
product will flow through the bed unaffected. If desired the acidity of the<br>
fixed bed material can be modified by addition of a base, e.g. Et3N or LiOH<br>
and other salts. If the remains of the catalyst are coloured, saturation of<br>
the fixed bed can be followed visually.<br>
Other ways to bind homogeneous catalyst remains to the<br>
modified support are slurrying the product solution with modified support<br>
material. After s certain time, the modified support material - with bonded<br>
catalyst remains can be removed from the process stream by simple<br>
decantation, filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation techniques. The<br>
modified support material can be collected and the valuable materials<br>
e.g. precious metals - can be recovered and re-used.<br>
The modified support can be prepared by slurrying the support<br>
in a polar or ap alar solvent, preferably in a. solvent in which the heteropoly<br>
acid or anion is also soluble. To this suspension, a solution of heteropoly<br>
acid or anion is added, in which the weight ratio of the heteropoly acid or<br>
its anion with the support is present in from about 0.01:1 to about 20:1.<br>
In a method according to the invention the reaction between the support<br>
and the heteropoiy acid is carried out at a temperature from -80 to 250<br>
degrees C, preferably at a temperature between 0 and 100 degrees C. The<br>
reaction times can be varied within broad limits. The reaction time can for<br>
example suitably be chosen in the range of 1 minute to 50 hours,<br>
preferably between 2 and 16 hours. After the reaction is completed, the<br>
solid material can be washed with any solvent that could remove<br>
unsupported heteropoly acids or anions and the solid can be dried at a<br>
temperature between 0 and 500 degrees C, with or without applied<br>
vacuum.<br>
The conditions for the present invention depend on the type of<br>
heteropoly acid, the nature of the metal complexes and the kind of<br>
reaction mixture. More in particular, the temperature may be between -80<br>
and 250oC, whereas the pressure may vary between 100 and 10-5 bar (a).<br>
The types of the chemical reactions contemplated in the context<br>
of the present invention are generally catalysed reductions, oxidations,<br>
couplings reactions, addition reactions, elimination reactions, and<br>
preferably (chiral) hydrogenations, (chiral) hydrogen transfer reactions, C-<br>
C coupling reactions (e.g. Heck, Suzuki, Stille, allylic substitutions,<br>
metathesis, polymerisations etc.), oxidations, (chiral) epoxidations,<br>
hydroformylations etc. In a preferred embodiment such chemical reactions<br>
are homogeneously catalysed reactions.<br>
Examples<br>
Preparation of silicontungstic acid modified alumina<br>
150 grams of alumina (230 m2, 150 raicron particles) were<br>
suspended in 500 mL ethanol, technical grade. 32.95 grams of<br>
silicotungstic acid were dissolved in 100 mL ethanol and dropwisely<br>
added to the spired alumina suspension in 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
After 14 hours tae stirring was stopped, and after another 2 minutes the<br>
upper layer was removed by decantation. The remaining solids were<br>
washed several limes with 1 L portions of demi H2O to remove any<br>
unsupported silicotungstic acid. The solids were dried at 200 degrees C.<br>
Analysis with ICP showed that the alumina, contained 11.7 wt% tungsten,<br>
which is equivalent to 18.0 wt% silicotungstic acid.<br>
Removal of [Rh(R,R)-Me-DuPHOS](COD)[BF4 catalyst remains<br>
12.6 mg of [Rh((R,R)-Me-DuPHOS)(COD)]BF4 (21 micromol) were<br>
dissolved in a 20 mL methanol solution containing 6.33 grains of dimethyl<br>
itaconate (40 mmol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The slightly orange<br>
coloured solution was transferred in a hydrogenation reactor. The reaction<br>
mixture was purged with H2. The reaction mixture was stirred under a<br>
hydrogen pressure of 20 psig for two hours at ambient temperature (22<br>
degrees C).<br>
A column (3.7 cm high, diameter 1.3 cm) was packed with 5.06<br>
grams of silicotungstic acid modified alumina (18.0 wt% silicotungstic<br>
acid, determined by ICP). After two hours the orange coloured solution<br>
was transferred from the reactor to the top of the column. A colourless<br>
solution was collected at the bottom of the column containing 6.01 grams<br>
(95 % yield) cf the hydrogenated product in high enantiomeric purity<br>
(enantiomeric excess (e.e.) 97.5 %, determined by Chiral GC). The<br>
colourless solution contained less than 10 microgram rhodium and less<br>
than 10 microgram of tungsten. The orange colour remained on the<br>
column. The solids from the column appeared to contain 11.7 wt%<br>
tungsten and 0.04 wt% rhodium (determined by ICP). The Rh presumably<br>
originates from the remains of the [Rh((R,R)-Me-DuPHOS)(COD)]BF4<br>
catalyst.<br>
Removal of [Ru((R)-BINAP)Cl2]2-NEt3 catalyst remains<br>
The catalyst precursor [Ru((R)-BINAP)Cl2]2.NEt3 was prepared as<br>
described by King et al in J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 6689-6691. The<br>
catalytic test was also performed as described in this article using 18.2 mg<br>
of [Ru((R)-BINAF)Cl2]2.NEt3 (21 micromol), 44 micromoles of HCl, 6.97<br>
grams of t-butyl acetoacetate (42.9 mmol) and 13 mL MeOH.<br>
A column (7.5 cm high, diameter 1.3 cm) was packed with 10.0<br>
grams of silicotungstic acid modified alumina (18 wt% silicotungstic acid,<br>
determined by ICP). After 12 hours the hydrogenation of t-<br>
butylacetoacetare was completed and the orange coloured solution was<br>
transferred from the reactor to the top of the column. A slightly yellow<br>
coloured solution was collected at the bottom of the column containing.<br>
6.46 grams (39 mmol, 91 % yield) of t-butyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, the<br>
hydxogenated product, in high enantiomeric purity (e.e. 93 %, chiral<br>
HPLC). The slightly coloured solution also contained 109 micrograms Ru<br>
(5 % of total amount of ruthenium) and less than 10 microgram of<br>
tungsten (determined by ICP).<br>
