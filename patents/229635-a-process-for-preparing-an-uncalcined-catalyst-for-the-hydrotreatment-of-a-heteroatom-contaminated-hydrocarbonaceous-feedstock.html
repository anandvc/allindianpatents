				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing an uncalcined catalyst for the hyrdotreatment of a heteroatom-contaminated hydrocarbonaceous feedstock<br>
Background  Art<br>
Petroleum   feedstocks   are   characterized   by   relatively high     levels     of     contaminants,      including     sulfur,      nitrogen, Conradson  carbon  residue,   aromatic  compounds  and metals  such as nickel,    vanadium   and   iron.       During   catalytic   hydroprocessing heterogeneous   catalysts   are   contacted  with   a   feedstock   in   the presence   of   hydrogen   under   conditions   of   elevated   temperature and pressure  to reduce the concentration of  the contaminants  in feedstocks.      The   hydrotreating  process   promotes   reactions   such as     hydrodesulfurization      (HDS) ,      hydrodenitrogenation      (HDN), Conradson      carbon      removal,       hydrodemetallation       (HDM)       and aromatics   saturation,   accompanied   by   a   boiling   shift   to   lower boiling    temperature    products.        As    the    sulfur-   and    nitrogen components    are    converted    into   hydrogen    sulfide    and    ammonia, metals   are   deposited   onto   the   catalyst.       The   results   include producing  ecologically clean hydrocarbon products  such as  fuels and     protecting     other     downstream     refining      catalysts      from deactivation.<br>
Processes for removing heteroatoms from feedstocks are<br>
known in the art as are catalysts for such removal. Typically,<br>
hydroprocessing catalysts contain Group VI and/or Group VIII<br>
active metal components supported on a porous refractory oxide<br>
such as alumina, alumina-silica, silica, zeolites, titania,<br>
zirconia,      boria,      magnesia     and     their     combinations.	Such<br>
catalysts    are    often    prepared   by    combining    the    active    metals with   the    support.       The   supports,    containing   metal    components,<br><br>
are typically dried and calcined at the temperatures ranging from about 370° C to 600° C to eliminate any solvent and to convert metals to the oxide form. The calcined metal oxide catalysts are then typically activated by contacting with a sulfuar containing compound such as hydrogen sulfide, organo sulfvar compounds or elemental sulfur to convert metal oxides into catalytically active metal sulfides.<br>
An important and continuing aim in the refining catalyst art is to develop new high performance hydroprocessing catalysts in order to obtain high quality oil products and improve refinery economics. Variations in compositional characteristics or methods of preparation of hydroprocessing catalysts have been attempted to reach these objectives.<br>
It is known in the art that uncalcined catalysts usually provide higher dispersion of active components thereby improving hydrotreating activities.   It is essential for the uncalcined catalysts that the active components, such as Group VI and/or Group VIII metal compounds, and promoters such as phosphorous, are not converted into oxide form during a high temperature  step.    That  is,  the  active  components  are maintained without chemical decomposition until sulfurizing. For  example,  US 5,198,100,  US  5,336,654  and US  5,33 8,717 disclose a method for preparing a hydrotreating catalyst by impregnating a refractory support with a salt of Group VI metals and with the Group VIII metal heteropolyacids.   The catalyst is not calcined or subjected to high temperatures, thereby retaining the heteropolyacids in the original form on the  support;  however,  complete  moisture  removal  from the catalyst during A   high vacuum drying step is required before the catalyst is sulfurized.<br>
In general, as the activity of an uncalcined catalyst is increased, the hydrotreating conditions required to produce<br><br>
a given oil product become more mild. Milder conditions require less capital investment to achieve the desired product specifications, such as allowed levels of sulfur, nitrogen, Conradson carbon residue, metals and aromatics, and the catalyst's life is extended due to lower coke formation and other factors.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that preparation of an uncalcined catalyst using a combined volatile content reduction-sulfurizing; step allows tor the catalyst to be prepared at lower temperatures, in less steps and without calcination, resulting in a catalyst with excellent hydrotreating activity and stability. Disclosure of the Invention<br>

In conventional preparation of sulfurized catalysts, an inorganic support is dried, calcined and combined with one or  more  catalytically  active  metals  to  form  a  catalyst precursor.  The precursor is then optionally aged and moisture is driven from the pores of the precursor by drying.   The catalyst precursor is then calcined at high temperatures in direct contact with hot gas to remove residual moisture and to convert  metal  precursor  into  oxide  form.    "Calcination temperatures"  as  used  herein  shall  mean  the  calcination temperatures of 400° C to 600° C, which are typically used in the art.   When calcination is completed,  the precursor is sulfurized to form a catalyst.<br>
Under the process of the present invention, a catalyst is prepared by combination of a porous carrier with one or more catalytically active metals to form a catalyst<br><br>
precursor having a volatile content. The volatile content of the catalyst precursor is then reduced in one or more steps. Volatile content reduction may take place, for example by treating the precursor in air at temperatures below calcination temperatures, or simply by dehydrating at ambient conditions. At least one of the volatile content reduction steps is conducted in the presence of one or more sulfur containing compounds and, prior to this combined volatile content reduction-sulfurizing step, the catalyst precursor is not allowed to reach calcination temperatures.<br>
The combined volatile content reduction-sulfurizing step(s) may be conducted in-situ or ex-situ. After volatile content and sulfurizing is completed, the catalyst may be activated further using a liquid phase activation at elevated temperatures. For example, if ex-situ pre-sulfurizing is employed, the catalyst may be contacted with a lighter feedstock to produce a supported metal sulfide catalyst. A variety of other sulfurizing techniques may be used to produce a sulfurized catalyst and reduce solvents from the catalyst pores at the same time. No conventional high temperature calcining of the catalyst or catalyst precursor is necessary.<br>
The catalyst undergoes a weight loss during processing as volatile compounds such as solvents and/or organic and inorganic ligands (functional coordinating groups having one or more pairs of electrons to form coordination bonds with metals) are removed. As used herein, "volatile content" shall mean weight loss as calculated following exposure of a sample to air at 482°C for two hours:<br>
(sample weight before treatment) - (sample weight after treatment) sample weight before treatment<br><br><br>
As used herein, "catalyst precursor" means a carrier which has been combined with one or more catalytically active metals which have not yet been activated.<br>
"Sulfurizing" when used herein means contacting the catalyst precursor with one or more sulfur containing compounds. A "sulfurized catalyst" is a catalyst in which active metal components are converted, at least in part, to metal sulfides.<br>
In the process of the invention, the catalyst precursor, that is a carrier with deposited active metals, and optionally promoters, is not calcined. At least one volatile content reduction step is conducted in the presence of one or more sulfur containing compounds. The volatile concent of the catalyst precursor is typically no less than about 0.5%, preferably from 2% to 25%, more preferably from 3 to 10%, most preferably from 6 to 10% before the catalyst precursor is exposed to the combined volatile content reduction-sulfurizing step. No calcination of the catalyst precursor is necessary or performed and, in fact, allowing the catalyst precursor to reach calcination temperatures is detrimental to the results seen when the process of the invention is used. The combined volatile content reduction-sulfurizinq step may be done in-situ (in the reactor where the catalyst will be used) or ex-situ. The hydrotreating performance of the resultant catalyst is greatly improved over catalyst made by the conventional method, and the process is simplified by eliminating the high temperature calcination step of conventional processes.<br>
A porous support is typically used to carry the catalytically reactive metal(s). For hydrotreating catalysts, supports are typically alumina, alumina-silica, silica, titania, zirccr.ia, boria, magnesia, zeolites and combbinations thereof.   ' Porous  carbon-based  materials  such  as  activated<br><br>
carbon and/or porous graphite can be utilized as well. The<br>
preferred supports in this invention are alumina-based and<br>
alumina-silica    based    carriers.	Catalytically    active   metals<br>
typically chosen from Groups VI and VIII of the Periodic Table<br>
are deposited onto the support. Typically the metals are<br>
selected from molybdenum, tungsten, cobalt, nickel, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Promoters, such as phosphorous may be used<br>
in cotsi&gt;ination with the catalytically active metals.<br>
Variations	in        catalyst	preparation        methods        include<br>
impregnation, co-mulling and co-precipitation. The preferred<br>
method in this invention is impregnation, with the most<br>
preferred method being incipient wetness impregnation. The use<br>
of aqueous solutions is common; however, organic solvents such<br>
as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones,<br>
etc., can be also used to deposit soluble active components and<br>
promoters onto the carrier. Examples of aqueous solutions<br>
include those containing molybdates (such as di- and hepta-<br>
molybdates), molybdo- and tungsto-phosphates and silicates,<br>
polyoxometallates (such as heteropolyacids and transition metal<br>
complexes thereof) , various metal chelate complexes, amine<br>
complexes,      etcf	The     pH    value     of     the     aqueous     solutions<br>
typically    range    from     1     to     12.	The     solution    preparation<br>
techniques   and  methods   for   impregnation   are   well   known   in   the art.<br>
The catalyst precursor of the present invention may-have some of its volatile content reduced in air at temperatures below calcination temperatures, including ambient conditions, or it may be moved directly to the sulfurizing step. Partial volatile content reduction to remove physically adsorbed solvents {remaining from an impregnation step) aids in transporting the catalyst should the volatile content reduction be   conducted   in-situ.<br><br>
Without being tied to a particular theory, it is believed that the process of the invention controls the formation of bulky metal oxide phases in the catalyst pores by direct interaction of the catalytic metal with a sulfur containing compound below calcination temperatures, such that thermal agglomeration of the active component does not occur. As the precursor is sulfurized, sulfur compounds displace the solvent and the sulfur reacts with the metals to form highly dispersed metal sulfides before a substantial amount of bulky metal oxidles can form. In the process of the invention the catalyst precursor, containing residual moisture, is exposed to a sulfur containing compounds at temperatures that convert the metal precursors to catalytically active metal sulfides and drive the moisture out  of  the catalyst  pores.<br>
Typical in-situ sulfurization may utilize either gaseous hydrogen sulfide in the presence of hydrogen or liquid-phase sulfurizing agents such as organo sulfur compounds including alkylsulfides and polysulfides, thiols, sulfoxides, etc.<br>
In ex-situ sulfurization, the catalyst is typically<br>
supplied to the user (refiner) in the "pre-sulfided" form where<br>
the metal oxides are converted at least in part to metal<br>
sulfides. Commercial ex-situ sulfurization processes include,<br>
for example, the ACTICAT® process (CRI International Inc.),<br>
described in US 5,468,372 and US 5,688,736, and the SULFICAT®<br>
process      (Eurecat     US     Inc.).	In     the     practice     of     present<br>
invention,   ex-situ  sulfurizing   is  preferred.<br>
In the present invention the known ex-situ and in-situ processes described are modified by not calcining the catalyst at high temperatures prior to contacting the catalyst with sulfur compounds. Ac least one cf the volatile content reduction    steps    is    conducced    in    the    presence    of    one    cr   more<br><br>
sulfur containing compounds, significantly higher activity and stability of the uncalcined catalyst are achieved as compared with catalyst made by conventional process of separate drying, calcining sulfurizing steps. It is believed that higher hydrotreating activity is achieved because if higher dispersion of active components since thermal agglomeration does not occur during catalyst preparation.<br>
The catalyst made by the process of the invention may be used in a process for removing heater room and other contaminants from a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock accompanied by boiling point reduction. Such a process comprises contacting of catalyst with a feedstock at elevated temperature and elevated pressure in the presence of hydrogen with one or more catalyst beds. Temperature are typically in the range from about 200° C to about 470° C , total pressure are typically in the range from about 443 kpa (50 psig) to about 24,233 kpa (3500 psig), and liquid hourly space velocities (LSHV) typically range from 0.05 to 25 h-1<br>
Examples<br>
Catalyst Activity Testing<br>
Hydrotreating activities of the catalyst of the following examples were compared on a volumetric basis using tickle flow micro-reactors. The same catalyst volume basis compacted bulk density, was used for each set of test conditions. The reactors were operated in an isothermal regime. To ensure appropriate irrigation and plug flow characteristics, the trilabe-shaped extrudated catalyst pellets were diluted 180-250 micron (80-60 mesh) SiC in the volumetric catalyst-to-dilutant ratio of either 1:1 (Test conditions 1-3) or 1:2:5 (Test condition 4),and located into the reactor in four aliquots.<br><br>
In Situ Catalyst Sulfurization<br>
A gas mixture of 5% H2S in hydrogen is used for catalyst sulfurizing. The sulfurizing pressure was maintained at about 443 Kpa (50 psig (Test conditions 1-3) and 1, 128 kpa (150 psig) (Test condition 4). Temperature ramping during sulfurization was as follows ambient to 204° C at a rate 1.5° C/min, holding for 2 hours , heating to 316° C at a rate of 2° C/min, holding for 1 hour, heating to 371° Cat a rate of 3° C/min, holding for 2 hours , cooling to 204 C and introducing a test feed.<br>
Ex- Situ Catalyst Sulfurization :<br>
The ex-situ pre-sulfurizing was performed using the ACTICATR process. A sample of catalyst was treated with a stoichiometric amount, based in the metal content of the catalyst, of powdered elemental sulfur plus 1.0 %w excess, based on the weight of the total catalyst followed by heating the sulfur-incorporated catalyst in the presence of a liquid olefinic hydrocarbon. The pre sulfurized catalyst precursors were activated in situ using standard liquid phase activation.<br>
Liquid Phase Catalyst Activation<br>
The ex-situ pre sulfurized catalyst precursors were placed into a trickle flow micro-reactor and activated with a diesel feed to convert the sulfur compounds on the pores into metal sulfides. Catalyst activation took place at a unit pressure of 6, 307 kpa (900 psig), a hydrogen flow rate of 220 ml/min, and a diesel feed LSHV of 1.5 h-1 The temperature was ramped to<br>
135° C and held for 1 hour, increased at rate of 24° C /hour to 371° C and held for 1 hour ; and decreased to 204° C and held for two hours followed by test feed introduction.<br><br>

An alumina extrudate (1.2 mm trilabe) was dried in air at 482° C for two hours. The extrudate had the following physical properties :<br>
Compacted bulk density	0.475 g/cc<br>
Water pore volume	0.94 cc/g<br>

After complete dissolution 7.02 g of 85% H3PO4 were added. The volume of the solution was adjusted to a value equal to the water pore volume of the support. 200gms of the support were impregnated with the solution and aged for 2 hours. The amount metals loaded (dry basis) was 8% w Mo, 2% wNi, and 1 %w P.<br>
To remove excess moisture, the catalyst precursor was air treated below 85° C for 1 hour and the volatile content was reduced to 6%, whereafter the precursor was recovered still containing residual moisture. The precursor was further dehydrated simultaneously with a sulfurizing during an ACTICATR process. No calculation steps were employed. The resultant catalyst is denoted as catalyst A.<br>

An alumina extrudate (1.2 mm trilabe) with the following properties was used to make catalyst B<br>
Compacted bulk density	0.484 g/cc<br>
Water pore volume	0.95 cc/g<br>
BET surface area	308 m2/g<br>
Catalyst B was prepared by pore volume impregnation of the support as described in example 1 followed by air drying at 121° C for 4 hours and calcination in air flow at 482° C for 2 hours. The catalyst was then sulfurized in situ via a conventional method using a 5% H2S in hydrogen mixture as described below. Catalyst B was calcined and sulfurized in two separate steps.<br>
Catalyst B was tested under test conditions 1. The HDS activity of catalyst B as WABT required for 88% HDS, is shown in figure 1.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
A commercial 1.3 trilobe extrudate carrier # 1 was used to make catalyst C<br>
The impregnation solution was prepared by stirring together 21.62 g NiO, 35.2 g M0O3, 9.05 g 86.1 % phosphoric acid and de-ionized water. The volume of the mixture was approximately 168 ml. The mixture was heated, with stirring to 39° C for about 3 hours until the impregnation solution components we re dissolved. The mixture was then cooled to ambient temperature. The volume of the solution was adjusted to the pore volume of 200 gms of the support, which was impregnated as described in example 1. The metal contents loaded were 3.8 %w Ni. 13.6 %w, Mo and 2.0 %w P (dry basis).<br>
The catalyst precursor was de hydrated in air at 99° C for four hours until the volatile content was 6%. The catalyst precursor was then treated with ACTICATR process without employing any calcination steps. The resultant catalyst is referred to as catalyst C.<br>
Catalyst C was tested in test condition 1 versus a commercial catalyst treated with the standard ACTICATR process using separate calcination and pre-sulfurizing steps (Catalyst D) The HDS activities of catalyst C and D, as WABT required for 88% HDS, are shown in figure 2.<br>
Example 4<br>
The properties of the alumins extrudate (1.2 mm trilobe) used to make catalyst E and F was as follows :<br>
Compacted bulk density	0.505 g/cc<br>
Water pore volume	0.87 cc/g<br>
B.E.T surface area	277 m2/g<br><br>
The impregnation solution was made by dissolving 5.25g NiCO3. And 16.67 g ammonium dimolybdate (NH4)2Mo3O7 (56.45 5w of Mo) in 60 ml of 14.8 % of NH3 solution in eater. The volume of the solution was adjusted to a 87cc, and l00gm of the support was impregnated as described in Ecxamplel. The metal loading was 2.3 %wNi and and 8.0 %w Mo (dry basis). The catalyst pre cursor was de hydrated overnight in air at 127° C to remove excessive moisture and ammonia, then cooled to ambient temperature and divided into two equal portion. The first portion was directly presulfurized using the ACTICATR process without any calcination step to remove residual moisture and load sulfur into the catalyst, as described in the example 3. The resultant catalyst is denoted as catalyst E. The second portion is conventionally claimed at 482° Cfor 2 hours, and sulfurized in situ using an H2 / H2S gas mixture (catalyst F)<br>
Catalyst E was tested versus catalyst Fusing test condition 1. The HDS relative volumetric activity (derived from the second order reaction rate consistants for the two catalysts) was 25% higher for catalyst compared to that for catalyst F at 400 hours on stream.<br>
Example 5<br>
Catalyst C was tested using test condition 2 versus a commercial catalyst (catalyst G) which used the same carrier as that for catalyst C. The (pre calcined) commercial catalyst was sulfurizied in situ using H2 / H2S gas mixture. The comparison test results are presented on figure 3 and 4.<br>
Example 6<br>
Catalyst C was tested versus a commercial reference catalyst (same as catalyst D except the sulfurizination of the pre claimed catalyst was performed in situ using an H2 / H2S gas mixture). The commercial mixture as catalyst H).<br>
HDS activities of the two catalysts were compared using test condition. The HDS relative volumetric activity (derived from the second order reaction rate constants for the two catalysts) was 25% higher for catalyst C compared to that for catalyst H at 400 hours on stream.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
A commercial 1.3 trilobe extrudate carrier #2 was used to make catalyst 1. The impregnation solution was prepared using the procedure description in example 6, however the metal contents (dry basis) were as follows : 13.0 5w Mo, 3.0 %w Ni, 3.2 %w P. The catalyst precursor was dehydrated in air at 99° C for three hours until the volatile content was 8%. The catalyst precursor was then treated with the ACTICATR process without any additional drying/calcination steps.<br>
Catalyst 1 was tested using test condition 4versus a commercial catalyst (catalyst J) having the same carrier and percentage of metals as catalyst I. The pre-calcined commercial catalyst was sulfurized in situ using an H2 / H2S gas mixture. The HDS relative volumetric activity (derived from the first order reaction rate constants for the two catalysts) was 20% higher for catalysts I compared to that for catalyst J at 200 hours on stream at 343° C WABT, and40% higher for the catalyst I at 300 hours at 363° C<br>
Example 8 - Comparative<br>
A commercial catalyst treated with standard ACTICATR process using separate calcination and pre-sulfurizing steps (catalyst D ) was compared with the same type of commercial catalyst sulfurized in situ with H2 / H2S gas mixture (catalyst K) using test condition 1. Catalyst D and catalyst K were statically undistinguishable in HDS and HDN performance during the test run (1400 hours in stream), demonstrating that effects seen due to the process of the invention are not due to differences in presulfurizing process.<br>
A s shown in the examples and seen figure 1-4, the HDS and HDN activities of the catalysts prepared by the process of the invention (catalysts A, C, E and I) are significantly higher than that of the catalysts prepared by standard processes utilizing separate steps for drying, calcining and sulfurizing. Consequently, substantially lower sulfur and/or nitrogen content in the petroleum product is achievable by combining the drying/sulfurizing steps and eliminating the calcining step. A higher activity catalyst makes it possible to operate a commercial unit at less severe conditions while producing on-spec product. This is turn should increase the catalyst life and decrease the operating costs.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
