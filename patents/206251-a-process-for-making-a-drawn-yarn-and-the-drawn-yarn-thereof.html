E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware   19898, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
FINE DENIER YARN FROM POLY(TRIMETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE)<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to very fine denier polyester yam made from poly(trimethylene terephthalate) fibers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polyester yams having very fine denier are highly desirable for manufacturing fabrics used in the garment industry. Such yarns are desirable because they yield a light-weight material having excellent properties such as softness. The softness of a yarn and fabric is a measure of how soft a material feels to the touch. A yarn and fabric used for many clothing apparel items require a high degree of softness.<br>
Very fine denier polyester fibers currently known in the art are made using polyethylene terephthalate. Such yarns provide softness suitable for many garments such as, e.g., dresses, jackets and other ladies' apparel. However, because polyethylene terephthalate has a high Young's modulus, the maximum softness achieved is not suitable for garments requiring ultra-soft touch.<br>
There is therefore a need in the art for very fine denier polyester yarns having superior softness quality. Theoretically, polyester yarns made from a polymer having a low Young's modulus should yield the desirable properties. However, attempts to commercially manufacture such a fine denier polyester yarn from poly(trimethylene terephthalate) have not been successful due to various manufacturing problems. For example, when attempting to make very fine denier yarns from poly(trimethylene terephthalate), excessive breaks in the fibers have been experienced. Further, it was thought in the prior an that the tenacity of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) was too low to successfully make a very fine denier yarn.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a process for making a drawn yarn comprising: (a) providing partially oriented feed yarn filaments prepared from a polyester polymer having an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.80 dl/g comprising at least 85 mole % poIy(trimethylene terephthalate) wherein at least 85 mole % of repeating units consist of trimethylene units; and (b) drawing the filaments between a set of feed rolls to produce a denier per filament less than about 1.5 and an actual draw ratio within 10 percent of a predicted draw ratio, wherein the predicted draw ratio is determined according to: [(elongation to break of the feed<br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary spinning position for making the very fine denier poly(trimethylene terephthalate) yarns of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a very fine denier polyester drawn yarn made from poly(trimethylene terephthalate) and a feed yarn and process for making the same. The very fine denier feed yarn of the present invention is a multifilament yarn wherein the denier per filament is less than about 2 dpf (2.22 dtex/filament). Preferably, the denier per filament of the feed yarn is less than 1.5 dpf (1.67 dtex/filament) and, most preferably, the denier per filament is less than 1 dpf (1.11 dtex/filament). The feed yarn denier per filament can be as low as 0.75. or even smaller. The very fine denier drawn yarn of the present invention is a multifilament yarn wherein the denier per filament is less than about 1.5 dpf (1.67 dtex/filament). Preferably, the denier per filament is less than,' 1 dpf (1.11 dtex/filament). The very fine denier drawn yarn can have a denier per filament of 0.65 dpf, preferably as low as 0.5 dpf, or smaller. The feed yarns (and consequently, the drawn yarns) are made from a polyester polymer, wherein said polymer comprises at least 85 mole % poly(trimethylene terephthalate) wherein at least 85 mole % of repeating units consist of trimethylene units, and wherein said polymer has an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.80 dl/g. Preferably, the intrinsic viscosity is at least 0.90 dl/g and, most preferably, it is at least 1.00 dl/g. Preferably, the polymer has an intrinsic viscosity of 1.5 dl/g or less, more preferably 1.2 dl/g or less. Partially oriented feed yarn is made using conventional melt-spinning techniques, at a spinning temperature of about 255°C<br><br>
to about 275°C. Molten polymer is extruded through spinneret orifices of diameter from about 0.12 mm to about 0.38 mm. The yarns of the present invention are drawn such that actual draw ratio is within ten percent of the predicted draw ratio. This requirement is satisfied if the draw ratio difference, ADR, is less than ten percent. The draw ratio difference, ADR, as defined herein is defined according to equation (I):<br><br>
where DRA is the actual draw ratio, and DRp is the predicted draw ratio. The predicted draw ratio, DRp is defined according to equation (II):<br><br>
where, EB(FY) is the elongation to break of the partially oriented feed yarn and EB(DY) is the elongation to break of the drawn yarn. Preferably, the actual draw ratio is within five percent of the predicted draw ratio and, most preferably, it is within three percent.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, molten streams 20 of poIy(trimethylene terephthalate) polymer are extruded through orifices in spinneret 22 downwardly into quench zone 24 supplied with radially or transversely directed quenching air. The diameter and quantity of orifices in spinneret 22 may be varied depending upon the desired filament size and the number of filaments in the multifilament yarn of the present invention. Further, the temperature of molten streams 20 is controlled by the spin block temperature, which is also known as the spinning temperature. It has been found that an orifice diameter of about 0.12 mm to about 0.38 mm can be used to produce the very fine filament yarns of the present invention. Further, a spinning temperature between about 255°C and 275°C is required to make the very fine denier yams of the present invention. Preferably, the spinning temperature is between about 260°C and 270°C and, most preferably., the spinning temperature is maintained at 265°C.<br>
Streams 20 solidify into filaments 26 at some distance below the spinneret within the quench zone. Filaments 26 are converged to form multifilament yarn 28. A conventional spin-finish is applied to yarn 28 through a metered application or by a roll application such as finish roll 32. Yarn 28 next passes in partial wraps about godets 34 and 36 and is wound on package 38. The filaments may be interlaced if desired, as by pneumatic tangle chamber 40.<br><br>
The partially oriented poly(trimethylene terephthalate) yarns are then drawn using conventional drawing equipment, such as a Barmag DW48. According to the present invention, the yarns are drawn such that the draw ratio difference, ADR, is less than ten percent, as described above.<br>
The drawing can comprise warp drawing or single end drawing. The very fine filament yarns of the present invention are suitable for air jet texturing, false-twist texturing, gear crimping, and stuffer-box crimping, for example. The yarns of the present invention may be used to make any fabrics which could be made from very fine denier polyethylene terephthalate yarns, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,250,245, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Tows made from these filament may also be crimped, if desired, and cut into staple and flock. The fabrics made from these improved yarns may be surface treated by conventional sanding and brushing to give suede-like tactility. The filament surface frictional characteristics may be changed by selection of cross-section, delusterant, and through such treatments as alkali-etching. The improved combination of filament strength and uniformity makes these filaments especially suited for end-use processes that require fine filament yarns without broken filaments (and yarn breakage) and uniform dyeing with critical dyes.<br>
The fine filament yarns of the present invention are especially suitable for making high-end density moisture-barrier fabrics, such as rainwear and medical garments. The surface of the knit and woven fabrics can be napped (brushed or sanded). To reduce the denier even further, the filaments may be treated (preferably in fabric form) with conventional alkali procedures. The fine filament yarns of the present invention may be co-mingled on-line in spinning or off-line with higher denier polyester (or nylon) filaments to provide for cross-dyed effects and/or mixed shrinkage post-bulkable potential, where the bulk may be developed off-line, such as over feeding in the presence of heat while beaming/slashing or in fabric form, such as in the dye bath. The degree of interlace is selected based on the textile processing needs and final desired yarn/fabric aesthetics. Because of the low Young's modulus of poly(trimethylene terephthalate), the very fine denier yarns of the present invention are especially suitable for fabrics where softness is important.<br>
The fibers of this invention can have round, oval, octa-lobal, tri-lobal, scalloped oval, and other shapes, with round being most common.<br>
Measurements discussed herein were made using conventional U.S. textile units, including denier, which is a metric unit. The dtex equivalents for denier are provided in parentheses after the actual measured values. Similarly, tenacity and<br><br>
modulus measurements were measured and reported in grams per denier("gpd") with the equivalent dN/tex value in parentheses.<br>
TEST METHODS<br>
The physical properties of the partially oriented poly(trimethyiene terephthalate) yarns reported in the following examples were measured using an Instron Corp. tensile tester, model no. 1122. More specifically, elongation to break, EB, and tenacity were measured according to ASTM D-2256.<br>
Boil off shrinkage ("BOS") was determined according to ASTM D 2259 as follows: a weight was suspended from a length of yarn to produce a 0.2 g/d (0.18 dN/tex) load on the yarn and measuring its length, L1. The weight was then removed and the yarn was immersed in boiling water for 30 minutes. The yarn was then removed from the boiling"'water, centrifuged for about a minute and allowed to cool for about 5 minutes. The cooled yarn is then loaded with the same weight as before. The new length of the yarn, L2, was recorded. The percent shrinkage was then calculated according to equation (III), below.:<br>
(Ill)     Shrinkage (%) - ^ii x 100<br>
Li<br>
Dry heat shrinkage ("DHS") was determined accordipg to ASTM D 2259 substantially as described above for BOS. L1 was measured as described, however, instead of being immersed in boiling water, the yarn was placed in an oven at about 160°C. After about 30 minutes, the yarn was removed from the oven and allowed to cool for about 15 minutes before L2 was measured. The percent shrinkage was then calculated according to equation (III), above.<br>
Intrinsic viscosity was measured in 50/50 weight percent methylene chloride/triflouroacetic acid following ASTM D 4603-96.<br>
Example I - Polymer Preparation Polymer Preparation 1<br>
Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) polymer was prepared using batch processing from dimethylterephthalate and 1,3-propanediol. A 40 lb (18 kg) horizontal autoclave with an agitator, vacuum jets and a monomer distillation still located above the clave portion of the autoclave was used. The monomer still was charged with 40 lb (18 kg) of dimethyl terephthalate and 33 lb (15 kg) of 1.3-propanediol. Sufficient lanthanum acetate catalyst was added to obtain 250 parts per million ("ppm") lanthanum in the polymer. Parts per million is used herein to mean micrograms per gram. In addition, tetraisopropyl titanate polymerization catalyst was added to the monomer to obtain 30 ppm titanium in the polymer. The temperature of the still was gradually raised to 245°C and approximately 13.5 lb (6.2 kg) of methanol distillate were recovered.<br><br>
An amount ot phosphoric acid in 1,3-propanediol solution to obtain about 160 ppm phosphorous in the polymer was added to the clave. If delustered polymer was desired, then a 20 percent by weight ("wt. %") slurry of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1,3-propanediol solution was added to the clave in an amount to give 0.3 wt. % in polymer. The ingredients were agitated and well mixed and polymerized by increasing the temperature to 245°C, reducing pressure to less than 3 millimeters of mercury (less than 400 Pa) and agitating for a period of four to eight hours. With polymer molecular weight at the desired level, polymer was extruded through a ribbon or strand die, quenched, and cut into a flake or pellet size suitable for remelt extrusion or solid state polymerizing. Polymer intrinsic viscosity ("IV") in the range of 0.60 dl/g to 1.00 dl/g was produced by this method.<br>
The polymer made by this process (with Ti02) was used in Example II-3. The polymers used in Examples II-5, II-6, II-7, II-8, II-9,111-13 and 111-14 were made in substantially the same manner, except that TiOi was not added, and had the same IV. The polymers for Examples 11-10 and III-15 were made in the same way, but had a slightly higher IV and did contain T1O2.<br>
Polymer Preparation 2<br>
Higher molecular weight polymer (IV &gt; 1.00 dl/g) for Examples II-2, III-11 and III-12 was produced by solid state polymerizing polymer chip or flake (made in the same way as described above) in a fluidized bed polymerizer. The polymer of Example III-l 1 included TiO?, whereas the others did not. Crystallized and dried polymer was charged to a fluidized bed reactor continually agitated and purged with dry, inert gas and maintained at a temperature of 200°C to 220°C for up to 10 hours to produce polymer with IV up to 1.40.<br>
Polymer Preparation 3<br>
Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) polymer for use in Example II-4 was prepared from terephthalic acid and 1,3-propanediol using a two vessel process utilizing an esterification vessel ("reactor") and a polycondensation vessel ("clave"), both of jacketed, agitated, deep pool design- 428 lb (194 kg) of 1,3-propanediol and 550 lb (250 kg) of terephthalic acid were charged to the reactor. Esterification catalyst (monobutyl tin oxide at a level of 90 ppm Sn (tin)) was added to the reactor to speed the esterification when desired. The reactor slurry was agitated and heated at atmospheric pressure to 210°C and maintained while reaction water was removed and the esterification was completed. At this time the temperature was increased to 235°C, a small amount of 1,3-propanediol was removed and the contents of the reactor were transferred to the clave.<br><br>
With the transfer of reactor contents, the clave agitator was started and 91 grams of tetraisopropyl titanate was added as a polycondensation catalyst. If titanium dioxide was desired in the polymer, a 20% slurry in 1,3-propanediol was added to the clave in an amount to give 0.3 wt. % in polymer. The process temperature was increased to 255°C and the pressure was reduced to 1mm Hg (133 Pa). Excess glycol was removed as rapidly as the process would allow. Agitator speed and power consumption were used to track molecular weight build. When the desired melt viscosity and molecular weight were attained, clave pressure was raised to 150 psig (1034 kPa gauge) and clave contents were extruded to a cutter for pelletization.<br>
T1O2 was added in the same amount and in the same way as in Polymer<br>
Preparation 1. "'	~<br>
Polymer of Example II-l Batch poly(trimethylene terephthalate) polymer having the properties described in Table 1 and 0.3 weight % Ti02 was used for Example II-l.<br>
Example II Several samples of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) polymer, prepared as described in Example I, were spun into partially oriented filaments, using a conventional remelt single screw extrusion process and conventional polyester fiber melt-spinning (S-wrap) process, as illustrated in Figure 1. The spinning conditions and properties for the resulting partially oriented yarns are set forth in Table I. The starting polymers had varying intrinsic viscosities, as indicated in Table I. The polymer was extruded through spinneret orifices having a diameter of about 0.23 mm. The spin block temperature was varied to obtain the polymer temperatures indicated in Table I. The filamentary streams leaving the spinneret were quenched with air at 21°C and collected into bundles of filaments. Spin finish was applied in the amounts indicated in Table I, and the filaments were interlaced and collected as multi-filament yarn.<br>
Each of the partially oriented yarns spun in this example was suitable as a very fine denier feed yarn for making drawn yarns according to the present invention, as illustrated in Example IV. yarn item "11-10" was suitable as a very fine denier direct-use partially oriented yarn in some applications. Such a fine denier partially oriented poly(trirnethylene terephthalate) yarn may be woven or knit into end use fabrics without further drawing.<br>
Example III This example showed the spinning parameters used to spin additional samples of poIy(trimethylene terephthalate) polymer into partially oriented filaments. The polymers used in this example were prepared as described in<br><br><br>
Example I. The spinning conditions and properties for the resulting partially oriented feed yarns are set forth in Table II. As with the feed yarns from Example II, the partially oriented yarns spun in this example were suitable for making very fine denier drawn yarns. yarn item "III-15" was also suitable as a very fine denier direct-use partially oriented yarn.<br>
Example IV The partially oriented feed yarns from Example II were drawn at a speed of 400 meters per minute ("mpm") over a heater plate at varying temperatures, with varying draw ratios. The drawing parameters and drawn yarn properties are 10     provided in Table III. As shown in Table III, the yarns of the present invention were drawn such that ADR is less than ten percent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

12.	The process as claimed in claim 11 wherein the undrawn filaments have a denier per filament less than about 1.0.<br>
13.	A process for making a drawn yarn comprising:<br><br>
a)	providing partially oriented feed yarn filaments prepared from the process as claimed in claims 11 or 12<br>
b)	drawing the filaments between a set of feed rolls to produce a denier per filament of 0.5 to 1.5 and an actual draw ratio within 10 percent of a predicted draw ratio, wherein the predicted draw ratio is determined according to: [(elongation to break of the feed yarn) + 115]/[elongation to break of the drawn yarn) +115).<br><br>
14.	The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the polymer has an intrinsic viscosity of 0.90 to 1.2 dl/g.<br>
15.	The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the spinning temperature is between 260° C and 270° C.<br>
16.	The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the polyester is melt-extruded through a spinneret having orifices between 0.12 to 0.38 mm in diameter.<br><br>
r<br><br><br>
17.	The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the polymer has an intrinsic viscosity of 1.00 to 1.2 dl/g.<br>
18.	A yarn prepared by the process of claim 1 as claimed in any of the preceding claims.<br><br>
19.	A drawn yarn prepared by the processtaomprising:<br>
a)	spinning a polyester polymer naving an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.80 to 1.5 dl/g comprising at least 85 mole % poly(trimethylene terephthalate) wherein at least 85 mole % of repeating units consist of trimethylene units, by melt extruding the polyester polymer in a molten state at a temperature between 255°C and 275°C though a spinneret to form partially oriented feed yarn filaments;<br>
b)	drawing the filaments between a set of feed rolls to produce the drawn yarn with a denier per filament of 0.5 to less than 1.0 and wherein the actual draw ratio is within 10 percent of a predicted draw ratio, wherein the predicted draw ratio is determined according to: [(elongation to break of the feed yarn) + 115]/[(alongation to break of the drawn yarn) +115)].<br><br>
20.	The drawn yarn as claimed in claim 19 having a denier per filament of at least 0.65 dpf.<br>
21.	The drawn yarn as claimed in claims 19 and 20 further comprising heating the filaments to a temperature greater than the glass transition temperature of the filaments, but less than 200°C prior to drawing the filaments.	 <br>
