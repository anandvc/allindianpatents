TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
<br>
This invention relates to the fields of pharmaceutical and organic chemistry, and provides suifonylpyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives, intemiediates. formulations and methods.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
<br>
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptannine or 5-HT), a key transmitter of the peripheral and central nervous system, modulates a wide ränge of physiological and pathological functions, mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HTi, 5-HT2, S-HTs. 5-HT4.5-HT5. S-HTg and 5-HT7. Although the functions of the latter three are less well understood than those of the others, it is generally accepted that Compounds which selectively interfere with 5-HT-mediated Signal transduction are important novel drug targets.<br>
<br>
The rat S-HTe receptor was cloned by two different groups (Ruat, 1993; Sebben, 1994), and that of the human, sharing a 89% sequence identity, shortly thereafter (Kohen, 1996). Much of the recent interest in the S-HTe receptor is because several psychotropic agents are high affinity antagonists at the human 5-HTe receptor {Kohe- 1996' Roth 1994). <br>
<br>
These Compounds include amrtriptyline (K=65 nM) and the arvpica^ aniosycnoiics ctazapine {K=9.5 nM). olanzapine iK=10 nM), and quetiapine iK=53 nM Sor^e inese Xf~Dounds, however. is selective. The first seiective 5-HT5 receptor aniagonis:-	are Ri 0-4-6790 ana Ro 63-0563. Their usefuiness is limited by their moderate affinity (K=50 nW and 12 nM, respectively) and poor pharmacokinetics (SIeight, 1998). With the recent deveiopment of the selective 5-HTs receptor antagonists Ro-04-6790 and SB-271046, there have been several reports on the activity of these Compounds in models of cognitive function. SB-271G46 improved Performance in the Morris water maze {Rogers, 1999). These resuits are consistent with the finding that chronic intracerebroventricular administration of antisense oiigonucleotides directed toward the S-HTs receptor sequence led to improvements in some measures of Performance in the Morris water maze (Bentley, 1999'^). Recently, the effect of S-HTg antagonists and S-HTe antisense oiigonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported {Bentley, 1997; Bentley, 1999^; Woolley, 2001). Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above accepted norms. <br>
<br>
Obesity is the most important nutritional disorder in the western world and represents a major health problem in all industrialized countries. This disorder leads to increased mortality due to increased incidences of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes.<br>
<br>
S-HTg selective ligands have been identified as potentially usefui in the treatment or Prophylaxis of certain disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's Chorea and/or Schizophrenie, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, mood disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), age related cognitive deciine, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases characterized by impaired neuronal growrth, sieep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, binge eating disorders, panic attacks, akathisia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, and pain, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. S-HTg selective ligands are also expected to be of use in the treatmerf of certain gastrointestinal disorders such as functional bowel disorder and Irritable Bowel Syndrome and in the treatment or Prophylaxis of obesity and type-2 diabetes, to achieve reduction of body weight and of body weight gain. The reduction of body weight and of body weight gain (e.g. treating body-weight disorders) is achieved inter alia by reduction of food intake.<br>
<br>
The goal of the present invention was to provide potent and selective 5-HTs antagonists<br>
chemically unrelated to any of the known S-HTe antagonists, Compounds usefui for the<br>
treatment of certain CNS disorders. <br>

Any Compound metabolized in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., the Compound of formula (1)) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the application. Prodrugs are therapeutic agents, inactive per se but transformed into one or more active metabolites. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall encompass treating the various disorders described with the Compound specificaily disciosed, or with a Compound that not specificaily disciosed, but that converts to the specified Compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Prodrugs are bioreversibie derivatives of drug molecules used to overcome some barriers to the Utility of the parent drug molecule. These barriers include, but are not limited to, solubility, permeabiiity, stability, presystemic metabolism and targeting limitations {Bundgaard, 1985; King, 1994; Stella, 2004; Ettmayer, 2004; Järvinen, 2005). Prodrugs, i.e. Compounds that when administered to humans by any known route, are metabolised to Compounds having formula (1), belong to the invention. In particular this relates to Compounds with primary or secondary amino or hydroxy groups. Such Compounds can be reacted with organic acids to yield Compounds having formula (1) wherein an additional group is present that is easily removed after administration, for instance, but not limited to amidine, enamine, a Mannich base, a hydroxyl-methylene derivative, an 0-{acyloxymethylene carbamate) derivative, carbamate, ester, amide or enaminone.<br>

'Crystal form' refers to various solid forms of the same Compound, for example polymorphs, solvates and amorphous forms. 'Polymorphs' are crystal structures in which a Compound can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Polymorphism is a frequently occurring phenomenon, affected by several crystallization conditions such as temperature, level of supersaturation, the presence of impurities, polarity of solvent, rate of cooling. Different polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, solid State NMR spectra, infrared or Raman spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. 'Solvates' are generally a crystal form that contains either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent. Often, during the process of crystallization some Compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystallina solid State, thus forming a solvate. When the solvate is water, 'Hydrates' may be formed. The Compound of formula (1) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in the form of a hydrate or a solvate, and such a hydrate and solvate are also encompassed in the present invention. Examples thereof irrdude 1.10 hydrate, % hydrate. y2 hydratS: monohydrate, dihydrcx;hio(1de hydrate, dihydrc»3nK&gt;rk:-e airrydrss olrydrochioride 3/2 hydrate. and the like.

While it may be possible for the Compounds of formula (1) to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a 'pharmaceutical composition'. According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically acceptabie salt or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptabie carriers thereof, and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be 'acceptabie' in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
<br>
The term "composition" as used herein encompasses a product comprising specified ingredients in predetermined amounts or proportions, as weil as any product that results, directly or indirectiy, from combining specified Ingredients in specified amounts. In relation to pharmaceutical compositions, this term encompasses a product comprising one or more active ingredients, and an optional carrier comprising inert ingredients, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectiy, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. In generai, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by unrformty and intimatery bringing the acöve ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a f.nsty divided sofsd -a—er " DotT: a-c tier-, if necessary. shaping the product into the desired fomuiatio-. ne crar—-.Dsjiion indudes enough of the active object Compound to produce the oesirec efe-ct ^por ne progress or condition of diseases. Accordingly, the pharmaceuticai compositions of the oresent invention encompass any composition made by admixing a Compound of the present invention and a pharmaceuticaiiy acceptable carrier. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatibie with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
<br>
Within the context of this appiication, the term 'combination preparation' comprises both true combinations, meaning a Compound of formula (1) and one or more other medicaments physically combined in one preparation such as a tablet or injection fluid, as well as 'kit-of-parts', comprising a Compound of formula (1)and one or more other medicaments in separate dosage forms, together with instructions for use, optionally with further means for facilitating compliance with the administration of the component <br>
Compounds, e.g. label or drawings. With true combinations, the pharmacotherapy by definition is simultaneous. The Contents of 'kit-of-parts', can be administered either simultaneously or at different time intervals. Therapy being either concomitant or sequential will be dependant on the characteristics of the other medicaments used, characteristics like onset and duration of action, plasma levels, clearance, etc., as well as on the disease, its stage, and characteristics of the individual patient.<br>
<br>
The affinity of the Compounds of the invention for S-HTe receptors was determined as described above. From the binding affinity measured for a given Compound of formula (1), one can estimate a theoretical lowest effective dose. At a concentration of the Compound equal to twice the measured K,-value, nearly 100% of the S-HTg receptors likely will be occupied by the Compound. Converting that concentration to mg of Compound per kg of patient yields a theoretical lowest effective dose, assuming ideal bioavailabijity. Pharmacokinetic, pharmaco- dynamic, and other considerations may alter the dose actualiy administered to a higher or lower value. The typical daiiy dose of the active ingredients varies within a wide ränge and will depend on various factors such as the relevant indication, the route of administration, the age, weight and sex of the patient, and may be determined by a physician. In general, total daily dose administration to a patient in Single or individual doses, may be in amounts, for example, from 0.001 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily, and more usually from 0.01 to 1,000 mg per day, of total active ingredients. Such dosages will be administered to a patient in need of treatment from one to three times each day, or as often as needed for efficacy, and for periods of at least two months, more typically for at least six months, or chronically.<br>
<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent to treat a condition treatable by administrating a composition of the invention.

Human-S-HTg- Aequorin cells express mitochondrial targeted apo-Aequorin. Cells have to be loaded with coelanterazine, in order to reconstitute active Aequorin. <br>
<br>
After binding of agonists to the human 5- HTg receptor the intracellular calcium concentration increases and binding of calcium to the apo- Aequorin/coelenterazine complex leads to an oxidation reaction of coelenterazine, which results in the production of apo-Aequorin, coelenteramide, CO2 and iight (X^ax 469nm). This iuminescent response is dependent on the agonist concentration. Luminescence is measured using the MicroBeta Jet (Perkin Elmer). Agonistic effects of Compounds are expressed as pECso. <br>
<br>
Antagonistic effects of Compounds were determined as inhibition of 10"® M a-methylserotonin induced luminescence and the pAz was caiculated according to Cheng-Preushoff equation. Compounds were tested at a 5 log concentration ränge, and 3 independent experiments were performed in duplicate. <br>
