Background of the Present Invention<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to thalidomide  derivatives,  the  method  of producing thereof, and the application thereof as an active pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
Description of Related Arts<br>
In 1953, thalidomide was synthesized and extensively used as a depressant and preventive medicine for vomiting in pregnant women. In the early 1960s, the serious reproductive toxicity had been identified. However, some of the properties of thalidomide, such as the inhibition in the releasing of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNFa), anti-angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory characteristics, make it more effective in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), cutaneous erythematosus lupes (Arch. Dermatol, 1993, Vol. 129 P. 1548-1550), persistent erythematosus lupes (The Journal of Rheumatology, 1989, 16, P. 923-92), Behcet's syndrome (Arch. Dermatol. 1990, vol. 26, P. 923-927), Crohn's disease (Journal of Pediatr. Gastroenerol. Nurt. 1999, vol. 28, P. 214-216) and rheumatoid arthritis (Journal of Rheumatology, 1988, vol. 25, P. 264-969). Furthermore, thalidomide has been extensively used in clinical trials for the treatment of malignant tumors when these tumors show strong angiogenesis and chemotherapy refractory. In 1998, the FDA of the United States approved the use of thalidomide for treating ENL. In addition, the reproductive toxicity of thalidomide has been completely controlled by birth-control, especially in those patients who are in critical condition. However, since thalidomide is only slightly soluble in water(0.012mg/mL, Arch. Pharm., 321, 371 (1988)), the bioavailability of thalidomide was poor, and posed a barrier for the administration of thalidomide extra-gastrointestinally. Also, the pharmacological research of thalidomide was affected.<br>
Snider et al. tried to improve the solubility of the thalidomide by directly linking amino acids onto it, although such method can generate compounds with increased water-solubility. Nonetheless, even if the water-solubility of some compounds even increase to 300 mg/ml (CN1215397A), these precursors of thalidomide were not stable in the water (Bioorganic and Med Chem. 9(5), 1297-1291, 2001), and can only be injected immediately after the solution was prepared. Dr. Eger's group had linked the thalidomide with p-dialkylamino benzoates and got their hydrochloride salts (DE 4211812 Al). Although the water solubility of these hydrochloride salts of the thalidomide derivatives are much higher than that of thalidomide, they are easy to be de-salted and precipitated out as their correspond bases from their aqueous solutions at pH7.5, indicating a decrease of their water solubility in condition close to physiological pH.<br>
Summary of the Present Invention<br>
A main object of the present invention is to provide novel water-soluble thalidomide derivatives for overcoming the shortcomings of the current technique. The thalidomide derivatives of the present invention are soluble in water to a certain extent within the range of physiological pH and stable in the gastric or enteric tract, thus increasing bioavailability when administered orally, and also enabling these derivatives to be administered outside the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. intravenous or intramuscular injection.<br>
