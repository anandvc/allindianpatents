				<td>Silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder, dispersion thereof and<br>
titanium-containing zeolite prepared therefrom<br>
The invention relates to a pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide powder and its preparation.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a dispersion<br>
comprising the pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
powder.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to processes for the<br>
preparation of a titanium-containing zeolite by means of<br>
the pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder or of a<br>
dispersion comprising this powder. The invention<br>
furthermore relates to the titanium-containing zeolites<br>
obtainable by these processes and to their use as a<br>
catalyst.<br>
The use of silicon-titanium mixed oxide powders for the<br>
preparation of titanium-containing zeolites is known from<br>
EP-A-814058. Titanium-containing zeolites are efficient<br>
catalysts for the oxidation of olefins using hydrogen<br>
peroxide. They are obtained by hydrothermal synthesis<br>
starting from silicon-titanium mixed oxide powders in the<br>
presence of a template. In EP-A-814058, it is disclosed<br>
that pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxides having a<br>
silicon dioxide content of 75 to 99.9% by weight and a<br>
titanium dioxide content of 0.1 to 25% by weight can be<br>
employed for this. A composition which contains from 90 to<br>
99.5% by weight of silicon dioxide and 0.5 to 5% by weight<br>
of titanium dioxide is particularly advantageous. As<br>
templates, amines, ammonium compounds or alkali/alkaline<br>
earth metal hydroxides can be employed.<br>
A disadvantage of the process disclosed in EP-A-814058 is<br>
the long reaction time which is necessary for the reaction<br><br>
of the silicon-titanium mixed oxide in the presence of the<br>
template. Furthermore, not all titanium-containing zeolites<br>
obtained according to EP-A-814058 show adequate catalytic<br>
activity.<br>
An object of the invention was therefore to make available<br>
a silicon-titanium mixed oxide, with which the reaction<br>
times in the preparation of the titanium-containing zeolite<br>
can be reduced. A further object of the invention was to<br>
make available a titanium-containing zeolite having a high<br>
catalytic activity.<br>
The invention relates to a pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide powder, which has<br>
-	a BET surface area of 200 to 400 m2/g,<br>
-	a silicon dioxide content of 97.0 ± 1.5% by weight,<br>
-	a titanium dioxide content of 3.5 ± 1.0% by weight and<br>
-	in which the sum of silicon dioxide content and titanium<br>
dioxide content is greater than 99.7% by weight,<br>
all percentages by weight relating to the total amount of<br>
the powder.<br>
Pyrogenic is to be understood as meaning metal mixed oxide<br>
particles obtained by flame oxidation and/or flame<br>
hydrolysis. In this process, oxidizable and/or hydrolysable<br>
starting, substances are as a rule oxidized or hydrolysed in<br>
a hydrogen-oxygen flame. The metal mixed oxide particles<br>
according to the invention are as far as possible pore-free<br>
and have free hydroxyl groups on the surface. They are<br>
present in the form of aggregated primary particles.<br>
It has been shown that a high BET surface area markedly<br>
reduces the period of time for the preparation of a<br>
titanium-containing zeolite from the silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide powder according to the invention.<br><br>
A silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder according to the<br>
invention having a BET surface area of 250 to 350 m2/g is<br>
preferred and particularly preferably one of 300 ± 30 m2/g.<br>
Furthermore, a silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder having a<br>
silicon dioxide content of 97.0 ± 1.0% by weight and a<br>
titanium dioxide content of 3.5 ± 0.75% by weight is<br>
preferred where the sum of silicon dioxide content and<br>
titanium dioxide content is greater than 99.9% by weight. A<br>
silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder having a silicon<br>
dioxide content of 97.0 ± 0.5% by weight and a titanium<br>
dioxide content of 3.5 ± 0.5% by weight is particularly<br>
preferred where the sum of silicon dioxide content and<br>
titanium dioxide content is greater than 99.9% by weight.<br>
The sum of silicon dioxide content and titanium dioxide<br>
content in the powder according to the invention is greater<br>
than 99.7% by weight and preferably greater than 99.9% by<br>
weight. The content of the metals Al, Ca, Co, Fe, K, Na, Ni<br>
and Zn is preferably less than 50 ppm each and particularly<br>
preferably less than 25 ppm each. The content of chloride<br>
is preferably less than 7 00 ppm. It has proved advantageous<br>
for the preparation of titanium-containing zeolites if the<br>
contents of these metals and chloride do not exceed these<br>
values. These impurities can originate from the required<br>
substances and/or can be caused due to the process.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of the silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder<br>
according to the invention in which<br>
- 97.0 ± 1.5 parts by weight calculated as SiO2 of a<br>
silicon chloride and 3.5 ± 1.0 parts by weight calculated<br>
as TiO2 of a titanium chloride are evaporated, the<br>
vapours are taken to a mixing chamber, hydrogen and<br>
primary air are taken to the mixing chamber separately<br>
therefrom,<br><br>
-	the mixture of the vapours of silicon chloride and<br>
titanium chloride, hydrogen-containing combustible gas<br>
and primary air is subsequently ignited in a burner and<br>
the flame is burned into a reaction chamber,<br>
-	secondary air is additionally introduced into the<br>
reaction chamber, the solid is subsequently separated<br>
from gaseous substances, and<br>
-	the solid is subsequently freed as far as possible from<br>
halide-containing substances by treatment with steam at<br>
temperatures of 250 to 700°C<br>
-	the amount of the required substances consisting of<br>
silicon chloride, titanium chloride, combustible gas,<br>
primary air and secondary air being chosen such that an<br>
adiabatic flame temperature Tad results, for which the<br>
following is true:<br>
900°C 
with<br>
Tad = temperature of required substances + sum of the<br>
reaction enthalpies of the partial reactions/heat<br>
capacity of the substances which leave the reaction<br>
chamber, comprising silicon-titanium mixed oxide, water,<br>
hydrogen chloride, if appropriate carbon dioxide, oxygen,<br>
nitrogen, and if appropriate of the carrier gas if this<br>
is not air or nitrogen, the specific heat capacity of<br>
these substances at 1000°C being used as a basis.<br>
The specific heat capacities can be determined, for<br>
example, with the aid of the VDI Warmeatlas [VDI heat<br>
atlas] (Chapter 7.1 to 7.3 and 3.7, 8th Edition).<br>
The reaction of the silicon chlorides and titanium<br>
chlorides in the presence of oxygen and of a combustible<br>
gas yields silicon-titanium mixed oxide, water,<br>
hydrochloric acid and, in the case of carbon-containing<br>
silicon and/or titanium compounds and/or carbon-containing<br><br>
combustible gases, carbon dioxide. The reaction enthalpies<br>
of these reactions can be calculated by means of standard<br>
works known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In Table 1, some selected values of reaction enthalpies of<br>
the reaction of silicon halides and titanium tetrachloride<br>
in the presence of hydrogen and oxygen are given.<br>
Methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS, CH3SiCl3) , trichlorosilane<br>
(TCS, SiHCl3) and/or dichlorosilane (DCS, SiH2Cl2) and<br>
titanium tetrachloride can particularly preferably be<br>
employed.<br><br>
Suitable combustible gases are hydrogen, methane, ethane,<br>
propane and/or natural gas, hydrogen being preferred.<br>
It can further be advantageous if the exit velocity of the<br>
reaction mixture from the mixing chamber to the reaction<br>
space is 10 to 80 m/s.<br>
The vapours of the silicon chloride and of the titanium<br>
chloride can also be taken to the mixing chamber, in mixed<br>
or separate form, by means of a carrier gas.<br>
The required substances combustible gas, primary air and/or<br>
secondary air can be introduced in preheated form. A<br>
suitable temperature range is 50 to 400°C.<br><br>
Furthermore, primary and/or secondary air can be enriched<br>
with oxygen.<br>
Preferably, the process according to the invention can be<br>
carried out such that SiCl4 is employed as silicon halide,<br>
TiCl4 is employed as titanium halide and the adiabatic flame<br>
temperature Tad = 1050 ± 50°C.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a dispersion which<br>
comprises the silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder according<br>
to the invention and water.<br>
The average aggregate diameter of the silicon-titanium<br>
mixed oxide particles in the dispersion is preferably less<br>
than 200 nm and particularly preferably less than 100 nm.<br>
Preferably, the following is true for the dispersion<br>
according to the invention: 10 
silicon-titanium mixed oxide 
the range is 12 
mixed oxide 
Furthermore, a dispersion can be preferred which<br>
additionally contains a basic, quaternary ammonium<br>
compound. Dispersions are particularly preferred which<br>
contain tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as, for example,<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetra-n-propylammonium<br>
hydroxide and/or tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide.<br>
The content of quaternary, basic ammonium compound in the<br>
dispersion according to the invention is not limited. If<br>
the dispersion is to be stored for a relatively long time,<br>
it can be advantageous to add to it only a part of the<br>
amount of the dispersion necessary for the preparation of a<br>
titanium-containing zeolite. Preferably, the quaternary,<br>
basic ammonium compound can be added in such an amount that<br>
a pH of 9 to 11, in particular 9.5 to 10.5, results. The<br>
dispersion shows good stability in this pH range.<br><br>
If the dispersion is to be employed, for example,<br>
immediately after its preparation for the preparation of a<br>
titanium-containing zeolite, the dispersion can already<br>
also contain the total amount of quaternary, basic ammonium<br>
compound. Preferably, the following is then true: 0.12 
mol of ammonium compound/mol of silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide 
silicon-titanium mixed oxide 
preferred.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of the dispersion according to the invention,<br>
comprising the steps:<br>
-	water, which, if the silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder<br>
introduced later leads to a pH of the aqueous phase of<br>4, is adjusted by addition of acids or bases to<br>
pHs of 2 to 4, is recycled from a receiver by means of a<br>
rotor/stator machine, and<br>
-	an amount of the silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder<br>
according to the invention is introduced continuously or<br>
batchwise by means of a filling device and with the<br>
rotor/stator machine running into the shear zone between<br>
the slots of the rotor teeth and of the stator slots<br>
such that a predispersion having a solids content of 20<br>
to 40% by weight results, and<br>
-	after all the silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder has<br>
been added, the filling device is closed and the<br>
predispersion is sheared further such that the shear<br>
rate lies in the range between 10 000 and 40 000 s-1, and<br>
-	if appropriate water and a basic, quaternary ammonium<br>
compound are subsequently added with retention of the<br>
dispersion conditions.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of a titanium-containing zeolite, in which the<br><br>
silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder according to the<br>
invention and a basic, quaternary ammonium compound are<br>
treated in an aqueous medium at a temperature of 150 to<br>
220°C for a period of less than 12 hours.<br>
Preferably, the process is carried out such that the<br>
following is true: 10 
titanium mixed oxide 
range is 12 
oxide 
It is furthermore advantageous to carry out the process<br>
such that the following is true: 0.12 
compound/mol of silicon-titanium mixed oxide 
Particularly preferably, the range is 0.13 
ammonium compound/mol of silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
As basic, quaternary ammonium compounds, tetraalkylammonium<br>
hydroxides such as, for example, tetraethylammonium<br>
hydroxide, tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide and/or tetra-n-<br>
butylammonium hydroxide are particularly preferred.<br>
Basic, quaternary ammonium compounds are used as templates<br>
which determine the crystal structure by incorporation into<br>
the crystal lattice. Tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide is<br>
preferably employed for the preparation of titanium<br>
silicalite-1 (MFI structure), tetra-n-butylammonium<br>
hydroxide for the preparation of titanium silicalite-2 (MEL<br>
structure) and tetraethylammonium hydroxide for the<br>
preparation of titanium (3-zeolites (BEA crystal structure) .<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of a titanium-containing zeolite, in which the<br>
dispersion according to the invention, if appropriate with<br>
further addition of a basic, quaternary ammonium compound,<br>
is treated at a temperature of 150 to 220 °C for a period of<br>
less than 12 hours.<br><br>
Under the specified conditions of the process according to<br>
the invention, the crystallization time is conventionally<br>
less than 12 hours. The crystals are separated by<br>
filtering, centrifuging or decanting and washed with a<br>
suitable washing liquid, preferably water. The crystals<br>
are then dried if needed and calcined at a temperature<br>
between 400°C and 1000°C, preferably between 500°C and<br>
750°C in order to remove the template.<br>
The particle fineness of less than 200 nm in the dispersion<br>
leads to rapid dissolution of the particles and formation<br>
of the titanium-containing zeolite.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a titanium-containing<br>
zeolite which is obtainable by the process according to the<br>
invention starting from silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
powder.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a titanium-containing<br>
zeolite which is obtainable by the process according to the<br>
invention starting from the dispersion comprising silicon-<br>
titanium mixed oxide powder.<br>
Both titanium-containing zeolites are obtained in powder<br>
form. For their use as an oxidation catalyst, they are<br>
converted if needed to a form suitable for use, e.g. to<br>
micropellets, spheres, tablets, solid cylinders, hollow<br>
cylinders or honeycombs, using known methods for the<br>
creation of pulverulent catalysts, such as, for example,<br>
pelletization, spray drying, spray pelletization or<br>
extrusion.<br>
The titanium-containing zeolites according to the<br>
invention can be used as catalysts in oxidation reactions<br>
with hydrogen peroxide. In particular, they can be used as<br>
catalysts in the epoxidation of olefins with the aid of<br>
aqueous hydrogen peroxide in a water-miscible solvent.<br><br>
Examples:<br>
Required materials: The required materials silicon<br>
tetrachloride and titanium tetrachloride of Examples 1 to 5<br>
have contents of Na, K, Fe, Co, Ni, Al, Ca and Zn of<br>
Examples 1 to 4: Titanium-silicon mixed oxide powder<br>
according to invention<br>
Example 1: 5.15 kg/h of silicon tetrachloride and 0.15 kg/h<br>
of titanium tetrachloride are evaporated. The vapours are<br>
taken to a mixing chamber by means of 15 Nm3/h of nitrogen<br>
as a carrier gas. Separately therefrom, 2 Nm3/h of hydrogen<br>
and 8 Nm3/h of primary air are introduced into the mixing<br>
chamber. The reaction mixture is fed to a burner and<br>
ignited in a central tube. The flame burns here in a water-<br>
cooled flame tube. 15 Nm3/h of secondary air are<br>
additionally introduced into the reaction space. The<br>
resulting powder is separated in a filter connected in<br>
series and subsequently treated with water vapour at 520°C<br>
in countercurrent.<br>
Examples 2-4 are carried out analogously to Example 1 using<br>
the amounts listed in the table.<br>
Example 5 is a comparative example whose composition lies<br>
in the range claimed, but has a markedly lower BET surface<br>
area than the claimed powders.<br>
The substance parameters of the powders obtained are<br>
summarized in the table.<br>
In all examples, the content of Na is 
Fe £1 ppm, Co 

 <br><br>
Example 6: Preparation of a dispersion (according to the<br>
invention)<br>
32.5 kg of completely demineralized water are initially<br>
introduced into a 100 1 stainless steel make-up vessel.<br>
Subsequently, with the aid of the suction nozzle of the<br>
Ystral Conti-TDS 4 (stator slots: 6 mm ring and 1 mm ring,<br>
rotor/stator distance about 1 mm), 17.5 kg of the silicon-<br>
titanium mixed oxide powder from Example 1 are drawn in<br>
under shear conditions. After completion of the drawing-in,<br>
the suction nozzle is closed and the 35 per cent by weight<br>
pre-dispersion is subsequently additionally sheared at 3000<br>
rpm for 10 min. Undesired warming of the dispersion due to<br>
the high energy input is countered by a heat exchanger and<br>
the temperature increase is restricted to a maximum of<br>
40°C. Due to the acidic character of the pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder, the pH of the<br>
dispersion is about 3.6.<br><br>

filling device is closed and the predispersion is sheared further such that<br>
the shear rate lies in the range between 10 000 and 40 000 s-1, and<br>
-	if appropriate water and a basic, quaternary ammonium compound are<br>
subsequently added with retention of the dispersion conditions.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
Title: A process for the preparation of pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder.<br>
Process for the preparation of a pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder having a<br>
BET surface area is 200 to 400 m2 /g, silicon dioxide content of 97.0 ± 1.5% by weight,<br>
titanium dioxide content of 3.5 ± 1.0% by weight and the sum of silicon dioxide content<br>
and titanium dioxide content being greater than 99.7% by weight, all percentages by<br>
weight relating to the total amount of the powder, said process is characterized in that<br>
97.0 ±1.5 parts by weight calculated as SiO2 of silicon halide and 3.5 ±1.5 parts by<br>
weight calculated as TiO2 of titanium halide are evaporated, the vapours are taken to a<br>
mixing chamber, hydrogen and primary air are taken to the mixing chamber separately<br>
therefrom, the mixture of the vapours of silicon halide and titanium halide, hydrogen-<br>
containing combustible gas and primary air is subsequently ignited in a burner and the<br>
flame is burned into a reaction chamber, secondary air is additionally introduced into the<br>
reaction chamber, the solid is subsequently separated from gaseous substances, and the<br>
solid is subsequently freed as far as possible from halide-containing substances by<br>
treatment with steam at temperatures of 250 to 700°C the amount of the required<br>
substances consisting of silicon chloride, titanium chloride, combustible gas, primary air<br>
and secondary air being chosen such that an adiabatic flame temperature Tad results, for<br>
which the following is true: 900°C 
substances + sum of the reaction enthalpies of the partial reactionslhead capacity of the<br>
substances which leave the reaction chamber, comprising silicon dioxide, water,<br>
hydrogen chloride, if appropriate carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and if appropriate of<br>
the carrier gas if this is not air or nitrogen, the specific heat capacity of these substances<br>
at 1000°C being used as a basis.</td>
