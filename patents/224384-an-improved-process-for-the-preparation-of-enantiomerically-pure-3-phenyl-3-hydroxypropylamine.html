				<td>The present invention provides an improved process for the synthesis of the enantiomerically pure 3-phenyl -3-hydroxypropylamine of formula-1. The present invention provides the process where styrene undergoes sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to give optically pure dihydroxy compound. The optically pure dihydroxy compound undergoes monotosylation of primary alcohol, then nucelophilic displacement by cyano group and subsequent reduction to amino group to furnish the desired enantiomerically pure 3-phenyl -3-hydroxypropylamine.

				<td>` The  present   invention  relates  to  an  improved  process  for  the  synthesis  of enantiomerically pure 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine. ,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to the said process using styrene. 3-Phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine is an important intermediate for the synthesis of a variety of antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine, tomoxetine and nisoxetine etc. Fluoxetine, tomoxetine and nisoxetine are among the most important pharmaceuticals for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, alcoholism) and also metabolic problems (obesity and bulimia) [(a) Zerbe, R. L.; Rowe, H.; Enas, G. G.; Wong, D.; Farid, N.; Lemberger, L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985, 232, 139; (b) Stark, P.; Hardison, C. D. Clin. J. Psychiatry 1985, 46, 53; (c) Robertson, D. W.; Jones, N. D.; Swrtzendruber, J. K.; Yang, K. S.; Wang, D. T. J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 185; (d) Robertson, D. W.; Krushinski, J. H.; Fuller, R. W.; Leander, J. D. J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 1412].<br>
In the prior-art the synthesis of 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine segment of fluoxetine and related analogues has been accomplished employing various synthetic strategies. A commonly used strategy for the synthesis of N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine is to employ the the reduction of ethylbenzoylacetate with a metal hydride followed by amidation, (G. Magnone, EP 380924, 8 Aug. 1990; Kumar, A. et al Tetrahedron Lett 1991, 32, 1901; Kumar, A. et al Indian J. Chem 1992, 31B, 803; Chenevert, R. et al Tetrahedron 1992, 48, 6769), enzymatic<br><br>
reduction of ethyl benzoylacetate with a chiral ligand e.g. (-)-DIP-chloride (Hilborn,<br>
J. W. US 5936124, 1999).<br>
In  another  prior-art method,  N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine  can  be<br>
obtained from asymmetric reduction of ß-chloropropiophenone with BH3 and chiral<br>
oxazoborolidine and subsequent substitution with methyl amine (Corey, E. J. et al<br>
Tetrahedron Lett 1989, 30, 5207).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine was<br>
obtained by enzymatic resolution process of ß-chloropropiophenone and subsequent<br>
substitution with methylamine (Schneider, M. P. et al Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1992,<br>
3, 525).<br>
In still another prior-art method, N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine was<br>
obtained by asymmetric epoxidation of cinnamyl alcohol and regioselective reductive<br>
opening of epoxide with Red-Al (Sharpless K. B. et al J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 4081;<br>
Young, J. W. W092-US888,1992, US-91-793036, 1991).<br>
In another prior-art method, 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine was obtained by the<br>
reduction of 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropanenitrile (Koenig, T. M. et al Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
1994, 35, 1339; Mitchell D. et al Synth. Commun. 1995,25, 1231).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine was obtained by<br>
asymmetric hydrogenation of ß-aminoketone catalyzed by cationic Rhodium (I)<br>
{AMPP} complex (Devocelle, M. et al Synlett 1997, 1307).<br>
In still another prior-art method, 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine was obtained by<br>
the asymmetric reduction of methyl-3-benzoylpropionate and subsequent conversion<br>
of product to amide and Hofman rearrangement (Hilborn, J. M. Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
2001,42,8919).<br><br>
Tomoxetine has been prepared via reduction of phenyl haloalkyl ketones with<br>
diisopinocamphenyl   haloboranes   as   key   steps.    The    intermediate   phenyl<br>
haloalkylketone was prepared in 75 % yield and 97 % ee (Brown, H. C. et. al US<br>
4868344, 1989; J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 2916). The same intermediate was prepared<br>
by Baker's yeast reduction and was further used for the synthesis of (R)-fluoxetine<br>
and (R)- and (S)-fenfluramine (Fronza, G. et. al J. Org. Chem., 1991, 56, 6019).<br>
In another prior-art method, fluoxetine hydrochloride is manufactured catalytically<br>
by hydrogenating 2-benzoyl-N-benzyl-N-methylethylamine in ethylacetate under H<br>
pressure of 5 bar using Pt/C or Pd-Pt/C catalyst as key step (Kairisalo, P. J. FI81083,<br>
1990).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, the (S)-3-amino-l-phenyl-propanol was prepared by<br>
the reaction of (S)-l-phthalimido-l-phenyl-propanol and anhydrous N2H4 in ethanol.<br>
This intermediate was subsequently used for the synthesis of fluoxetine derivatives<br>
(Fuller, R. W. et al EP 369685,1990).<br>
In still another prior-art method, the N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine was<br>
prepared by the condensation of PhCH(OH)CH2CH2NMe2 with ClC02Et and<br>
subsequent hydrolysis (Schwartz, E. EP 529842,1993).<br>
In prior-art method, the optically active fluoxetine was prepared employing N-<br>
methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropionamide as a precursor which in turn was prepared<br>
by lipase catalyzed resolution of PhCH(OH)CH2COOEt (Yashida, N. Jpn. Kokai<br>
Tokkyo Koho JP 04005268, 1992).<br>
Fluoxetine and its analogs are prepared by the etherification of 1 -phenyl-3-(N-<br>
methylamino)-propan-l-ol with an arylating reagent (Agusti Cruz, A. ES 2120368,<br>
1998; Arosio, R. US 5847214, 1998).<br><br>
In yet another prior-art method, N-methyl-3R-hydroxy-3-phenylpropylamine was<br>
prepared by resolving the racemic by 5-(+)-mandelic acid (Ratz, A. M. EP 909754,<br>
1999).<br>
In still another prior-art method, 3-(methylamino)-l-phenyl-l-propanol was prepared<br>
by reaction of methylamine with 3-chloro-1-phenyl-1-propanol and subsequently<br>
converting into fluoxetine (Weber, B. WO 2000037425, 2000) or by converting<br>
chloropropiophenone into racemic alcohol and resolving it by the chiral separation<br>
(Gattuso, M. J. Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 2000290239,2000).<br>
Some of the major drawbacks of the methods known in the prior-art are such as<br>
(i)       Multi-step synthesis<br>
(ii)      High cost of materials involved<br>
(iii)     Complicated  reagents,   longer  reaction  time  and  high  reaction temperature<br>
(iv)     Difficulties involved in work-up procedure<br>
(v)      Difficulties involved in handling sophisticated reagents<br>
(vi)     Overall low yield of the desired compound<br>
(vii)    Poor enantio-selectivity<br>
(viii)   Lack of reusability of expensive reagents In view of the abovementioned drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior-art procedure, it is desirable to develop an improved, efficient and enantioselective process for the synthesis of 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved, efficient process for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure 3-phenyl-3-hydroxy-propylamine, which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior-art processes employing the Sharpiess<br><br>
asymmetric dihydroxylation,  selective monotosylation of primary alcohol  and nucleophilic displacement by cyno and subsequent reduction to amino group.<br>
The significant feature of the present invention is:<br>
(i)       The process relatively involves less number of steps (ii)      The reaction involved in each step according to the present invention, could be  carried out relatively at  lower temperature  or room temperature (iii)     The process leads to high yields of the desired compound (iv)     Both the enantiomers of 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine could be<br>
prepared using this process (v)      The process gives high enantioselectivity of the product (vi)     The chiral ligands used to induce chirality could be recovered The process of the present invention is described in details in schematic diagram herein below<br>

To a mixture of (5)-phenylethylene glycol, dry triethylamine in dry dichloromethane cooled at -15° C was added portion wise p-toluenesulfonyl chloride over a period of lh. The reaction was stirred at -15° C for 24h and quenched by adding water. The solution was extracted with dichloromethane and then combined organic phase was washed with aqueous CuSO4, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated. Silica gel column<br><br>
chromatography of crude product using petroleum ether: EtOAc (4 :1) as eluent gave monotosyl compound as a white solid.<br>
To stirring mixture of monotosyl compound in ethanol-H2O (4 : 1) at 0°C was added NaCN in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24h. The reaction mixture was concentrated at 50°C on rotatory evaporator and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried (Na2S04) and concentrated. Silica gel column chromatography of crude product using petroleum ether : EtOAc (3 :1) as eluent gave (S)-3-phenyl-hydroxypropanenitrile as a colorless oil.<br>
To a THF solution of (S)-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropanenitrile was slowly added THF solution of borane dimethyl sulfide complex at room temperature. Methyl sulfide was then distilled from the reaction vessel and the resulting THF solution refluxed for 2.5h. After cooling to room temperature methanolic HC1 was added to the reaction mixture. Methanol and methyl borate were removed by distillation and the reaction mixture neutralized with sodium hydroxide (5N). Extraction of the mixture with dichloromethane followed by concentration provided the crystalline (S)-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine.<br>
