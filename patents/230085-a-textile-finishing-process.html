Condensation products of hydroxycarboxylic acids and glycols or glycerol<br>
useful as an acid donor<br>
The invention relates to reaction products of glycols, diglycols or higher glycols and also glycerol with a-hydroxycarboxylic acids, and to the use thereof as acid donors and for controlling the pH in textile treatment processes.<br>
Textile treatment processes generally achieve uniform treatment of the textile fibres by employing pH and/or temperature gradients instead of constant conditions. Especially the employment of a pH gradient demands an increased process engineering input, since for example acid has to be continuously metered in to lower the pH. Processes are therefore in existence in the prior art where, to avoid the metered addition of acid for example an agent is added that releases the requisite amount of acid incrementally with or without temperature increase.<br>
CH patent 669882 utilizes reaction products of ethylene oxide with formic acid and of ethylene glycol with formic acid and isopropyl formate as acid donors. US .patent 4568351 describes reaction products of formic acid or P-hydroxycarboxylic acids with ethylene oxide for use as acid donors.<br>
The added compounds hydrolyse during the textile finishing operation and make it possible to lower the pH of a liquor in steps. In dyeing processes for example the use of the aforementioned agents permits a slow and uniformly progressive fixation, whereby a more uniform dyeing is achieved.<br>
JP patent 3083403 describes condensation products of hydroxyl-substituted dicarboxylic acids with alkylene glycols which are useful as levelling agents in dyeing processes for polyamide fibres. US 3600121 describes esters of alkylcarboxylic acids and polyethylene glycol as retarding agents for the uniform coloration of cellulose fibres.<br>
An important variable for determining the efficacy of the-products used as acid donors and buffer compounds is the hydrolysis number. The hydrolysis number is determined as a<br><br>
characteristic parameter in the analysis of fats. The hydrolysis number is defined as the amount of potassium hydroxide in milligrams (mg) needed to neutralize the esterified and unesterified fatty acids contained in 1 g of fat. The hydrolysis number is thus a measure of the amount of acid which can be released from an ester by complete hydrolysis. The hydrolysis number should consequently also be determining for the trajectory of the pH curve during a textile finishing operation.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that the reaction of an oc-hydroxycarboxylic acid conforming to the general formula (I) with a glycol, diglycol or higher glycols conforming to the general formula (II) or with glycerol in a molar ratio of 2:1 or higher leads to an unexpected trajectory of the pH curve. Of particular advantage here are condensation products of a diglycol or higher glycol with an a-hydroxycarboxylic acid in a molar ratio of 1:2 or higher, preferably 1:2, 1:3 or 1:4. Since such condensation products are generally statistical mixtures, the molar ratio need not necessarily be an integral ratio.<br>
Useful a-hydroxycarboxylic acids conform to the general formula (I)<br><br>
where R is hydrogen or a C1.3 alkyl group, preferably methyl. Condensation thereof with suitable glycols, diglycols or higher glycols of the general formula (II)<br><br>
where R' is CM alkylene, preferably ethylene, and y is not less than 1, preferably from 1 to 5, especially 1 or 2, provides (poIy)hydroxycarboxyli'C acid (poly)glycol esters of the general formula (III)<br><br><br>
where R, R' and y are each as defined above and x' is from 1 to 5. In preferred compounds, R is a methyl group, R' is ethylene, x* is from 1 to 3 and y is from 1 to 3. Particular preference is given to compounds where xf is from 1.5 to 2 and y is 1 or 2.<br>
Condensation of suitable a-hydroxycarboxylic acids of the general formula (I) with glycerol<br><br>
provides (poly)hydroxycarboxylic acid glyceryl esters of the general formula (IV)<br><br>
where R is as defined above, the radical R" is a glycerol radical, x" is from 0.5 to 2.5, preferably from 0.5 to 1, and y is 1. What is decisive is the ratio of y to x", so that in principle it is also possible for just two hydroxyl groups of the glycerol or for all three hydroxy! groups to be esterified with different numbers of a-hydroxycarboxylic acids, x" is to be understood as the average value of the number of condensed a-hydroxycarboxylic acids. For a molar ratio of 1:2 for glycerol to a-hydroxycarboxylic acid, x" is therefore 0.5.<br>
The compounds are prepared by known methods. For instance, compounds of the formula (III) are obtainable by reaction of x'+l mol of an a-hydroxycarboxylic acid conforming to the<br><br>
formula (I) with I mol of the corresponding glycol, diglycol or higher glycol of the formula (II). The reaction products can if necessary be purified after isolation.<br>
Compounds of the  formula (IV) are obtainable by reaction of 2x"+l   mol  of an a-hydroxycarboxylic acid conforming to the formula (I) with 1 mol of glycerol. Owing to their higher degree of branching, the glycerol condensation products obtained have a higher viscosity than the corresponding glycol condensation products.<br>
The invention thus provides compounds of the formula (V)<br><br>
where R is hydrogen or a C1.3 alkyl group, preferably methyl, nx is from I to 5, preferably<br>
from I to 3, n is 1 or 2 and<br>
when n = 1 the radical R" is CM alkylene, preferably ethylene, x is defined as x' and y is not<br>
less than 1, preferably from 1 to 5, especially 1 or 2 and<br>
when n = 2 the radical R" is a glycerol radical, x is defined as x" and y is = J.<br>
The hydrolysis number, which should be useful as an acidity measure of esters, is unexpectedly not correlated with the molar effectiveness as an acid donor in the case of the condensation products according to the invention. On the contrary, it was surprisingly found that condensation products having a molar ratio of 1:2 or higher are more effective than prior art condensation products having a molar ratio of 1:1 in terms of the molar amount used. The compounds according to the invention are consequently of immense benefit, economically.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may be useful as acid donors in textile finishing processes   without   significantly   increasing   the   process   engineering   investment.   The<br><br>
compounds according to the invention hydrolyse in the course of the textile finishing process and permit processing with variable pH at constant or variable temperatures. Generally, the abovementioned compounds are used to incrementally lower the pH of a liquor. But they can also be used for stabilizing the pH in acidic liquors in which the pH would otherwise rise in the course of the treatment operation.<br>
More particularly, the compounds according to the invention are also useful for minimizing the changes in the pH of the liquor. This is particularly advantageous when the textile treatment agent or dye is instable to such changes.<br>
The use as an acid donor and an agent for controlling the pH in textile treatment operations is particularly advantageous in dyeing processes for textiles made of natural, synthetic and semisynthetic fibres. Especially treatment operations under weakly alkaline or acidic conditions with constant or variable pH are of importance.<br>
natural fibres and synthetic polyamides, for example nylon. Usefiil natural textile materials<br>
further include cellulose fibres, for example cotton, semisynthetic textile materials, for<br>
example cellulose acetates, and also mixtures thereof.<br>
Usefiil wholly synthetic textile materials include linear aromatic polyesters, for example polyethylene terephthalates, especially the condensation products of terephthalic acid with glycols or with l,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane. Further polycarbonates, for example from a,aHJimethyl-4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane and phosgene, and also polyvinyl chlorides, polyacrylonitriles and polyamides.<br>
The textile materials can be present in any conventional form, for example as fibres, yarns, webs, woven or non-woven textiles.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (V) can bemused either as such or in the form of a preparation together with emulsifiers and/or dispersants.<br><br>
Preference is given to using the compounds in concentrations of 0.1 to 5 g/I, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 1 g/I.<br>
Textile treatment processes for the purposes of the present invention are in the widest sense dyeing, printing and brightening processes and also all finishing processes in which the pH has an influence on the effect of the process. The processes in question can be continuous or batchwise.<br>
Dyeing processes can utilize acid dyes, metal complex dyes, reactive dyes, basic dyes and disperse dyes together with the compounds and processes according to the invention.<br>
Preferred temperature ranges are from 20 to 140°C, especially from 70-100°C.<br>
Preferred pH ranges are between 5 and 10 at the start of the process and between 3 and 7 at the end of the process. Depending on the amount of the compound used, the pH can be kept constant or incrementally reduced. The compounds according to the invention can be added all at once or incrementally in the course of the process. An alkaline liquor can be adjusted with known agents, for example aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, sodium carbonate, borax, sodium acetate or ammonia, at the start of the process.<br>
