				<td>DNA sequence coding for a protein of A. thaliana having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity, delta7-Red protein, production process, strains of transformed yeasts, uses.<br>
The present invention relates to a DNA sequence coding for a protein of A. thaliana having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity, delta7-Red protein, theirproduction process, strains of transformed yeasts, and their uses.<br>
Delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase (E.G.1.3.1.21) is a microsomal enzyme whose presence has been revealed by its activity in homogenates of rat's liver (M. E. Dempsey et al., Methods Enzymol., 15, 501-514, 1969) as well as in plant preparations of Zea mays (M. Taton et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 181, 465-473, 1991).  This reductase is dependent on NADPH and reduces 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol in vitro.<br>
Sterols are the main constituents of the membranes in eucaryotes but show structural differences depending on the species.  In the cells of eucaryotes such as yeasts, the principal sterol is ergosterol which contains a double unsaturation in position C-5 and C-7, a branched side chain in position C-24 and an unsaturation in position C-22 while in mammals cholesterol is characterized by an unsaturation in position C-5 and a saturated side chain.  Sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, which represent the most common sterols in plants, have a branched but saturated side chain and, as with the sterols of vertebrates, do not have an unsaturation in position C-7.  The enzyme responsible for this difference in structure of the sterol nucleus is delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase.<br>
Delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase has never been purified to homogeneity and only a partial purification has<br>
been described (M. E. Dempsey et al.; M. Taton et al., already quoted).  The protein has not been characterized by its physical-chemical properties.  No information on the sequence of the protein and no antibody directed against it have been described.  Furthermore, an apparent deficiency in 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase has been described in man associated with RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome (J. M. Opitz et al., Am. J. Med. Genet., 50, 326-338, 1994).<br>
Cloning of a cDNA coding for delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase, which may enable the sequence of the corresponding protein to be identified as well as the characterization of the human gene or a congenital deficiency of it to be revealed, is not therefore achievable with known methods which make use for example of hybridization and/or immunological detection techniques.  The obtaining of inventive screening methods allowing cloning to be carried â€¢ out, in particular in the absence of information about the protein, is therefore particularly sought-after.<br>
Ergosterol, the principal sterol of the membranes of fungi, contains a pair of conjugated double bonds in position C-5,7 which confers an antimycotic activity on compounds of the family of polyenes such as nystatin (R. Bittman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 260, 2884-2889, 1985).  The strong dependency of the action of nystatin on the membrane concentration of unsaturated sterols in position C-5,7 has allowed the selection of mutant strains vis-a-vis accumulated sterols in S. cerevisiae (S. W. Molzahn et al., J. Gen.  Microbiol., 72, 339-348, 1972).  Thus the mutants erg2 and erg3 accumulate sterols which do not have conjugated double bonds in position C-5,7 because of a deficiency in sterol delta-8,7 isomerase (W. Ashman et al., Lipids, 26, 628, 1991) and in sterol delta-5 dehydrogenase (B. Arthinton et al., Gene, 102, 39, 1991) respectively.  Such mutants are viable because ergosterol, the principal natural sterol of yeast, can be replaced under certain conditions by different substitution sterols including cholesterol.<br>
The advantage of increasing the resistance to nystatin of yeast strains enriched with sterols not having the double<br>
unsaturation in position C-5,7 was perceived by the inventors for cloning a cDNA coding for a heterologous protein having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity with a screening method using a metabolic interference in S. cerevisiae.  The success of this approach which offers the advantage of being independent of knowing the DNA sequences or the protein as well as a detection solely based on the enzymatic activity, is not however foreseeable due to the many technical difficulties to be overcome.<br>
A first limitation comes from the fact that the way nystatin works is not entirely elucidated (L. W. Parks et al., CRC Critical Reviews in Microbiology, 301-304, 1978). For example, the low specificity of the selection by nystatin is foreseeable due to the indirect nature of it which leads in yeast to the selection of spontaneous genomic mutations such as the erg mutants (S. W. Molzahn et al. already quoted) or genomic mutations involving resistances independent of the sterol pathway.  Similarly, cells transformed by a gene library can express heterologous genes conferring a resistance to nystatin unrelated to the sterol pathway.<br>
Another example of the expected limitation relates to the fact that the heterologous protein could be weakly active in the cell, leading to the absence of or to a low resistance to nystatin for example for one of the following reasons: 1) the gene coding for delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase is weakly expressed; 2) the protein is weakly or not active because of poor folding or as a result of an incorrect subcellular orientation; 3) the plant protein does not recognise the yeast's own sterols as substrates or 4) the sterols which can be substrates are in the esterified form or stored in vesicles and are not in contact with the enzyme. It can therefore be anticipated that the sterols accumulated in this way escape the action of delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase which, in eucaryotes, is reputed to be localized in the microsomes.<br>
The present invention relates to the cloning of a cDNA of A. thaliana coding for a protein having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity, designated delta-7Red,<br>
according to a cloning process carried out in a yeast by metabolic interference based on the resistance to nystatin. The delta-VRed protein allows the sterols having an unsaturation in position C-7 to be reduced by a biological reduction process, which in addition provides an advantageous solution to the problem of the selective reduction in position C-7 of sterols or steroids having a double unsaturation in position C-5,7 which the reduction methods using chemical routes do not allow.<br>
The invention also relates to transformed yeast cells expressing the delta-7Red which, in a surprising manner, accumulate products saturated in position C-7 and optionally saturated in position C-22 which, contrary to ergosterol, are substrates of the restriction enzyme of the side chain of cholesterol, i.e. cytochrome P450SCC.<br>
These unexpected properties allow the use of the transformed yeasts of the invention in a preparation process for sterols or steroids having an industrial and/or pharmacological use, in particular the preparation of pregnenolone by biological oxidation of endogenic yeast sterols, reduced in position C-7, by cytochrome P45QSCC (P450SCC) in the presence of adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) and adrenodoxin (ADX).  The transformed yeasts of the invention can be also used in a preparation process for intermediate steroids of the metabolization route of cholesterol into hydrocortisone in mammals and other vertebrates.  This use has the advantage of allowing the preparation of hydrocortisone or its intermediates in a biological oxidation process which does not require the use of an exogenic sterol such as cholesterol as the initial substrate and thus bypassing the problem of the penetration of a sterol into the yeast whose impermeability to exogenic sterols under aerobiosis conditions has been described (R. T. Lorentz et al., J. Bacteriology, 981-985, 1986).<br>
The invention also relates to the use of nucleic sequences obtained using the cloning process of the invention.  An RNA or DNA sequence coding for delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase can be used for the diagnosis or the<br>
treatment of affections implicating the product of the gene of delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase.  For example, a deficiency in delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase which converts 7-dehydro cholesterol into cholesterol is presumed to be implicated in RSH/SLO syndrome.  Thus a human DNA sequence can be used as a probe for diagnosing a deficiency in delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase and can also be used in gene therapy to correct such a deficiency.<br>
Therefore a subject of the present invention is a nucleic acid sequence containing a sequence coding for a protein having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity, said nucleic acid being a DNA or an RNA and in particular being a cDNA.<br>
The delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity can be revealed for example using an enzymatic test in vitro described further on in the experimental part.<br>
A more particular subject of the invention is a cDNA sequence in which the coding sequence codes for a protein of A. thaliana having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity and having the nucleotide sequence of the sequence SEQ ID No. 1:<br>

The above cDNA sequence which codes for a protein having 430 amino acids corresponding to the sequence shown in Figure 3 (SEQ ID No. 2) is a cDNA sequence which can be obtained for example by cloning in a yeast, starting from an A. thaliana expression library, by using a screening method based on the appearance of a resistance of the yeast to nystatin, according to operating conditions a detailed description of which is given further on.<br>
Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID No. 1 above allows the present invention to be reproduced by methods known to a man skilled in the art, for example by chemical synthesis or by screening a gene library or a cDNA library using synthetic oligonucleotide probes by hybridization techniques or by PCR amplification.<br>
Also a subject of the invention is a DNA sequence coding for a protein having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity and which hybridizes with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID No. 1 under conditions of average or high stringency or which have a sequence identity of approximately 60% and more with this sequence.<br>
The sequences which hybridize in a detectable manner with sequence SEQ ID No. 1 hybridize under standard conditions of average stringency, for example a hybridization<br>
at 42Â°C, for 12 hours in a 50% solution of formamide, SSCX6 followed by washings or under less stringent conditions, for example a hybridization at 42Â°C for 24 hours in a 20% solution of formamide, SSCX6 followed by washings under known standard conditions (T. Maniatis et al., Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989).<br>
The percentage of nucleotide sequence identity can be determined by using for example the BLAST program "basic local alignment search tool" (S. F. Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215, 403-410, 1990) on the NCBI server.<br>
The invention also relates to a DNA sequence coding for a protein having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity and amplifiable by the PCR technique using as primers the oligonucleotides coding for a consensus sequence having the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 3:<br>
Leu Leu Xaa Xaa Gly Trp Xaa Gly Xaa Xaa Arg Xaa Xaa Xaa Tyr<br>
15	10	15<br>
in which Xaa in position 7 is Trp or Tyr and Xaa in position 12 is His or Lys.<br>
The above sequence SEQ ID No. 3 corresponds to a new consensus sequence which has been defined by alignment of the identity of amino acid sequences between the new sequence SEQ ID No. 2, deduced from the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID No. 1, and known sequences either of other sterol reductases having a specificity of action at a position other than position C-7, or of lamin B receptors, as is detailed further on in the experimental part.  From the information given by the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 3, a primer constituted by at most 45 nucleotides can be defined and synthesized which, combined with a second primer oligodT (17 nucleotides) as rebound sequence, will allow using a commercially-available PCR assay kit (for example Stratagene) the amplification of a DNA coding for a protein having delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity.<br>
The invention also relates to a protein of A. thaliana having a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity and<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
EXAMPLE 1; Cloning of the cDNA coding for delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase (delta-7Red) of A. thaliana A - Screening of the expression library of A. thaliana in yeast<br>
The starting cDNA expression library is the library described by M. Minet et al. (Plant J., 2, 417-422, 1992) which was prepared from mRNA of A. thaliana at the two-leaf germination stage and whose cDNA's bordered by the Not I site have been inserted at the Bst XI site of the expression cassette of the shuttle vector E. coli/S. cerevisiae pFL61. This cassette contains the promoter and terminator sequences of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK).  The origin of replication of the yeast derived from the 2u sequence and a selection indicator URA3 ensure the propagation of the vector in the yeast.  The propagation of the vector in E. coli is derived from the plasmid pUC19.<br>
The yeast strain FY 1679 (Mata), which is an isogenic strain of the strain S288C described by A. Thierry et al. (Yeast, 6, 521-534, 1990), was transformed by the cDNA library using the lithium acetate method described by D. Gietz et al. (Nucleic Acids Res., 20, 1425, 1992).<br>
The cells were plated on a synthetic medium SGI containing 7 g/1 of "yeast nitrogen base" (Difco), 1 g/1 of bactocasaminoacids (Difco), 20 g/1 of glucose, 20 mg/1 of tryptophan and which is free from uracil.  105 prototrophic transformants for uracil were obtained then grouped and again plated on the same synthetic medium free from uracil and containing 2 or 5 /zg/ml of nystatin at the rate of 5xl04 cells per dish. 106 cells for each nystatin concentration were screened in this way.  After incubation for 3 days at 28 Â°C, approximately 100 clones, which have grown at a concentration of 2 ng/ml of nystatin, were collected by constituting groups of 5 clones whose sterol composition was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (called RP-HPLC in what follows) while a single resistant clone, called F22, was obtained at a concentration of 5 /xg/ml of nystatin. B - Analysis of the sterols accumulated in the clone F22<br>
The total sterols of the yeast are prepared according to the alkaline saponification method described by L. Parks et al. (Methods in Enzymol., Ill, 333-346, 1985), then analyzed by RP-HPLC and/or by gas chromatography (called GC).<br>
The residue of sterols obtained is dissolved in an ethanol-tetrahydrofuran-water mixture (65:10:25 v/v) then analyzed by RP-HPLC on an Applied Biosystems CIS bonded silica column (100 x 2.1 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and at 55Â°C using a linear gradient of methanol in water (50% to 100% over 18 min) and a photometric detection at 205 nm and 285 nm compared with the ergosterol, campesterol and cholesterol standards.<br>
The composition of sterols is also analyzed by GC on an Alltech SE-30 capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm) with helium as carrier gas, a temperature of 280Â°C and 310Â°C for the injector and the detector respectively, with an initial<br>
increase in the temperature of 110Â°C to 245Â°C at a speed of 45Â°C/min, then of 3Â°C/min in order to reach 280Â°C.<br>
The analysis by RP-HPLC (Figure 1A) and the analysis by GC (Figure IB) show the profile of the accumulated sterols in the clone F22 obtained above characterized by the virtually complete disappearance of ergosterol, majority sterol of the non-transformed strain FY 1679, and its replacement by two majors sterols and in similar quantity which do not absorb at 285 nm and thus no longer have a conjugated double unsaturation according to analysis by RP-HPLC.<br>
In Figure 1A, the campesterol (Sigma) (24-R-ergosta 5-ene 3-ol) contains approximately 35% of dihydrobrassicasterol (24-S-ergosta 5-ene 3-ol). c - Cloning of the delta-7Red cDNA<br>
The plasmids originating from the clone F22 were amplified in E. coli according to the method described by J.-N. Strathern et al. (Methods in Enzymol., 194, 319-329, 1991), then digested by Not I.  A fragment of about 600 base pairs (bp) and a fragment of 1.6 kbp were obtained.  The strain FY1679 was transformed with each of the above fragments respectively.  The composition in sterols of each clone of the transformed yeast was analyzed as indicated above and allowed the plasmid carrying the gene responsible for the modified profile in sterols to be distinguished.  The plasmid identified in this way was named pF22. D - Determination of the cDNA sequence of delta-7Red<br>
The cDNA insert of pF22 was sub-cloned at the Not I site of the vector pUC9N derived from pUC9 (Pharmacia) in which the Eco RI site of the multiple cloning site is replaced by the insertion of a Not I restriction site while retainingthe reading frame of the LacZ gene.  A restriction map was then determined (Figure 2).<br>
Restriction fragments having the Not I external site and the EcoRI, PvuII or Hindlll internal sites respectively were sub-cloned in the pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene).  The nucleotide sequence was determined by the Sanger method with DNA polymerase Sequenase (Stratagene kit) on the two strands by using direct and inverse primers of pBluescript pUC9, T3<br>
and T7 or deduced specific primers of the cDNA nucleotide sequence.<br>
The compilation of all of the sequences obtained gives the delta-7Red cDNA nucleotide sequence of A. thaliana (SEQ ID No. 1) represented in Figure 3.  It comprises 1496 nucleotides ending with a polyadenylation sequence.  It has an open reading frame starting with a methionine initiator at nucleotide 76 and ending with a termination codon at nucleotide 1366.  This results in an open reading frame of 1290 nucleotides coding for a protein of 430 amino acids. The coding region of the delta-7Red cDNA codes for the protein delta-7Red the deduced amino acid sequence of which (SEQ ID No. 2) is shown in Figure 3.  The sequence of the protein includes 430 amino acids amines having a calculated molecular mass of 49.286 kDa.<br>
A sample of the E. coli DH5-1 strain containing delta--7Red cDNA in the vector pUC9N (designated delta7red/pUC9N cDNA) was deposited at the CNCM on 10th February 1995 under the number 1-1535.<br>
E - Determination of the consensus sequence SEQ ID No. 3 Using computerized searching of sequence databases (Genbank and EMBL), it has been shown that the sequence of the delta-7Red protein of A. thaliana has some sequence similarities with other sterol reductases, in particular sterol C-14 reductase and sterol C-24(28) reductase of S. cerevisiae described by R. T. Lorentz et al. (DNA Cell Biol., 11, 685-692, 1992) and W. Chen et al. (Yeast, 7, 305-308, 1991) respectively as well as the product of the sts 1+ gene of S. pombe described by M. Shimanuki et al. (Mol. Biol. Cell, 3, 263-273, 1992) and sterol C-14 reductase of Neurospora crassa (No. X77955 in the EMBL database).  In addition, the delta-7Red protein shows a similarity with the 400 amino acids of the C-terminal end of the chicken lamine B receptor and with that of the corresponding human receptor described by H. J. Worman et al. (J. Cell Biol., Ill, 1535-1542, 1990) and E. Schuler et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 269, 11312-11317, 1994).<br>
Sequence identity alignments were established between<br>
the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No.   2  deduced from the delta-7Red cDNA obtained above and those of the three yeast sterol reductases and the two lamine B receptors,   then a new consensus sequence having the amino acid sequence   (SEQ ID No. 3):<br>
Leu Leu Xaa Xaa Gly Trp Xaa Gly Xaa Xaa Arg Xaa Xaa Xaa Tyr<br>
15	10	15<br>
in which Xaa in position 7 is Trp or Tyr and Xaa in position<br>
12 is His or Lys,<br>
was defined in order to prepare oligonucleotides which can be<br>
used as primers to amplify, by PCR, new genomic DNA or cDNA<br>
sequences coding for a protein having a delta-5,7 sterol,<br>
delta-7 reductase activity.<br>
F - Expression of the delta-7Red protein in yeast.<br>
a) construction of the expression vector delta-7/V8 inducible<br>
in yeast<br>
The deletion of the non-coding regions of cDNA of pF22 was carried out by the PCR amplification using the following specific oligonucleotides:<br>
5'CGCGGATCCA TGGCGGAGAC TGTACATTC 3' (SEQ ID No. 4) and 5'CAGGGTACCT CAATAAATTC CCGGAATG 3' (SEQ ID No. 5)<br>
which were defined in order to introduce a BamH I restriction site immediately upstream of the initiation codon and a Kpn I site immediately downstream of the stop codon.<br>
The cDNA was amplified starting from 1 ng of "delta7red/pUC9N cDNA" plasmid in the presence of 2 units of Pfu DNA polymerase and 0.2 uM of each of the above primers by using the following amplification conditions: 94Â°C, 10s; 52Â°C, 50s; 74Â°C, 90s; 33 cycles with the Stratagene PCR kit.<br>
A fragment of approximately 1300 bp was obtained, then digested by the restriction enzymes BamH I and Kpn I and inserted into the BamH I and Kpn I sites of the E. coli/S. serevisiae pYeDPl/8-2 shuttle vector (called V8) described by<br>
C. Cullin et al. (Gene, 65, 203-217, 1988).  V8 carries the selection indicator URA3 and contains an expression cassette in the yeast containing the promoter GAL10/CYC1 and the terminator sequence of the PGK gene.  The vector thus obtained, called delta-7/V8, allows the inducible expression by galactose of the delta-7Red protein.<br>
b)	Production of the delta-7Red protein<br>
The yeast strain FY 1679 (Mata) was transformed with the delta-7/V8 plasmid obtained above by using the lithium acetate method described by D. Gietz et al. (already quoted).<br>
The transformed yeast was cultured at 27Â°C, in the SGI selective medium described above but in which the glucose concentration is 5 g/1, until a cell density saturation (OD6Q0nin=12) is obtained.  The culture is then diluted by the addition of a volume of complete medium YP (10 g/1 in yeast extract (Difco) and 10 g/1 in bactopeptone (Difco)), then the addition of ethanol (1.5% v/v) as a source of carbon.  When the growth has been allowed to reach a cellular concentration of at least 7xl07 cells/ml, the expression of delta-7Red was induced by the addition of galactose at a concentration of 20 g/1.<br>
The induction was also carried out in an SLI selective minimum medium, which corresponds to the SGI medium in which the glucose is replaced by galactose (20 g/1), until a cellular concentration of 2 x 107 cells/ml is obtained.<br>
c)	Enzymatic test in vitro of the delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7<br>
reductase activity<br>
Expression of the delta-7Red protein was revealed by using an enzymatic test described by M. Taton et al. (Biochem. Bioph. Res. Commun., 181, 465-473, 1991) but without an NADPH regeneration system, with microsomal or cytosolic cell preparations of the above induced yeast.<br>
The cellular fractions were obtained by mechanical rupture of the induced cells and isolation of the fractions by ultracentrifugation according to the method described by P. Urban et al. (Eur. J. Biochem., 222, 843-850, 1994).  The cells are collected then washed twice with TE-KCl buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; ImM EDTA, 0.1 M KC1) and resuspended in<br>
0.6 M TE-sorbitol lysis buffer.  Glass beads with a diameter of 0.45-0.5 mm (Braun) are added until they show through the surface of the cellular suspension which is then agitated for 5 min at 4Â°C.  The cellular lysate on the surface is collected and the glass beads are washed three times with the lysis buffer.  The lysate and the washings are united then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 13 min at 4Â°C so as to eliminate the mitochondrial fractions.  The collected supernatant is centrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 g and at 4Â°C.  The pellet which contains the microsomal fraction and the supernatant which represents the cytosolic fraction are collected separately.<br>
The microsomal fraction or the cytosolic fraction obtained are incubated respectively for 90 min at 37Â°C in 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer at pH 7.3 containing as substrate 150 urn of 7-dehydrocholesterol emulsified with Tween 80 (1.5 g/1) -and in the presence of 2 mM of NADPH.  The sterols are extracted by the addition of 3 volumes of a methanol-dichloromethane mixture (50:50, v/v) then analyzed by GC in comparision with standard products.<br>
The formation of cholesterol (RT = 15.887 min) from 7-dehydrocholesterol (RT = 16.528 min) is shown in Figure 4 with a microsomal fraction (3.5 mg/ml of protein) obtained above from the yeast FY 1679 transformed with the delta-7/V8 vector, induced for 3 hours and the endogenic sterols of which have higher retention times (RT = 16.682 min for ergosta 5-22 diene 3-ol; RT = 17.249 min for ergosterol and RT = 17.664 min for ergosta 5-ene 3-ol).<br>
These results show that the delta-7Red protein, on the one hand is expressed in the transformed yeast, and on the other hand has a delta-5,7 sterol,delta-7 reductase activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 2; Reduction in vivo of endogenic sterols of yeast unsaturated in position C-7<br>
Yeast strains whose majority sterols have a double bond in position C-5,7 were transformed with the delta-7/V8 vector obtained in Example 1, then cultured and induced as indicated in Example 1.  The endogenic sterols, whose profile is<br><br>
analyzed by GC, were extracted and purified by RP-HPLC as indicated in Example 1 by using a preparative CIS column (100 X 4.6 mm), then identified by IR, UV, MS and NMR.  The following three strains were used respectively:<br>
-	Strain FY1679 described in Example 1;<br>
-	Mutant strain erg5, called PLC 1051, characterized by a<br>
deficiency in sterol C-22 desaturase, which was constructed<br>
by crossing between the strain FY1679 and the original strain<br>
po!5 described by S. W. Molzahn et al. (J. Gen. Microbiol.,<br>
72, 339-348, 1972) and which accumulates the ergosta 5,7-<br>
diene 3-ol.<br>
-	The mutant double strain erg4,5, called PLC 1451,<br>
characterized by a deficiency in sterol C-22 desaturase<br>
(erg5) and sterol C-24(28) reductase (erg4), was obtained by<br>
crossing between the strain FY1679 and a strain po!5<br>
described by S. W. Molzahn et al. (already quoted) having<br>
acquired a spontaneous resistance to nystatin during a<br>
systematic screening of yeasts searching for mutants of<br>
sterols and which accumulates ergosta 5,7,24(28) triene 3-ol.<br>

mutation erg4, erg5, grows in the presence of galactose and a<br>
non-fermentable substrate and is auxotrophic for uracil,<br>
tryptophan and histidine.  The strains PLC 1051 and PLC 1451<br>
were deposited at the CNCM on 10th February 1995 under the<br>
numbers 1-1536 and 1-1537 respectively.<br>
The major reduced sterols identified respectively from the above three transformed strains are indicated in the following table:EXAMPLE 3: Production of pregnenolone in vitro by restriction of yeast endogenic sterols reduced in position C-<br>
7<br>
Production of pregnenolone is carried out by using the enzymatic restriction test of the side chain of cholesterol in vitro described by Wada et al. (Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 290, 376-380, 1991) in which 260 uM of a sterol reduced in position C-7 obtained in Example 2 is incubated in 150 ul of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20 in the presence of 140 nM of adrenodoxin reductase, 1.16 uM of adrenodoxin and 0.68 uM of cytochrome P450SCC of bovine origin obtained from the suprarenal glands for example according to D. W. Seybert et al., J. Biol. Chem., 254, 12088-12098, 1979.<br>
The reaction is triggered by the addition of 150 uM of NADPH.  After incubation for 80 min at 37Â°C, the reaction is stopped by the addition of a volume of a methanol-dichloromethane mixture (50:50 v/v).  The sterols are extracted and analyzed by GC as indicated in Example 1.<br>
Figure 5 shows respectively that ergosta 5-ene 3-ol<br>
 (Fig. 5A), ergosta 5,24(28) diene 3-ol (Fig. 5B) or ergosta 5,22 diene 3-ol (Fig. 5C) is the substrate of cytochrome P450SCC and leads to a product having an identical RT to that of pregnenolone obtained under the same conditions by restriction of cholesterol.<br>
The results obtained show that a transformed yeast expressing delta-VRed accumulates usable sterols directly to prepare pregnenolone by biological oxidation in vitro. EXAMPLE 4; Construction of yeast strains producing pregnenolone or its acetic ester in vivo<br>
A - Construction of the strain ELR01 containing an expression cassette for the delta-7Red of A. thaliana integrated in the locus ADE2 of the haploid strain FY1679 mating type a (FY1679 Mata)<br>
a) Construction of the integrative plasmid pADdelta-7 (pADA7):<br>
Construction of the plasmid pAD 7 was carried out as described in Figure 6.  The Bglll fragment (2244pb) containing the ADE2 gene of S. cerevisiae was isolated from the plasmid pASZ 11 (A. Stotz et al., Gene, 95, 91, 1990) and inserted in the pBluescriptll KS+ vector (Stratagene) at the BamHI site of the multiple cloning site.<br>
The plasmid obtained, called pBS-ADE2, was then linearized at its single Stu I site and dephosphorylated.<br>
A fragment of approximately 2.44 kb containing the promoter GAL10/CYC1, the coding phase of delta-7Red (sterol 7 reductase) and the terminator PGK (tPGK) was obtained from the plasmid delta-7/V8, obtained in Example IF by the PCR technique using the following oligonucleotides as primers:<br>
5' GATTACGCCA AGCTTTTCGA AAC 3'         (SEQ ID No. 6) and 5' AGATCTTGAG AAGATGCGGC CAGCAAAAC 3'   (SEQ ID N o. 7)<br>
which have been defined to pair with the 3' end of tPGK and the 3' end of the URA3 gene respectively.  The following were used: the plasmid delta-7/V8 as a template (80 ng), the above oligonucleotides (0.5 /xM each), native Pfu DNA polymerase (1<br>
unit in the buffer recommended by Stratagene) and the following amplification conditions: 35 cycles; 1 min at 95Â°C; 5 sec. at 95Â°C; 30 sec. at 56Â°C; 4 min 30 sec. at 70Â°C).  The amplification fragment obtained was then cloned at the blunt ends in the above linearized plasmid pBS-ADE2 to give the plasmid pADA? in which the Notl-PstI fragment of approximately 4720 pb carries the ADE2 gene interrupted by the expression cassette of delta-7Red. b) Chromosomic integration in the yeast strain FY1679 Mata:<br>
The Notl-PstI fragment (4720 bp), isolated from the plasmid pADA7 digested with the restriction enzymes NotI and PstI, was introduced into the yeast FY1679 Mata by transformation using the lithium acetate method described by D. Gietz et al. (already quoted).<br>
The transformants having integrated this fragment by homologous recombination were selected by their resistance to nystatin, this phenotype being due to the expression of delta-7Red which converts the delta-5,7 sterols of the yeast into delta-5 sterols.<br>
The transformed cells were incubated at 28Â°C for 4 hours in the complete medium YP described in Example IF containing glucose (20 g/1) and supplemented with adenine (20 mg/1). They were then concentrated then plated on an SLI-agar minimum medium (lg/1 of bactocasaminoacids; 7 g/1 of "yeast nitrogen base"; 20 g/1 of galactose; 20 mg/1 of adenine; 20 g/1 of agar) and incubated overnight at 28Â°C to induce the expression of the delta-7Red gene.  The absence of uracil complementation allows the growth of cells to be limited. The clones were collected, grouped then plated on dishes on a complete medium YP containing galactose (20 g/1), supplemented with adenine (20 mg/1) and in the presence of increasing concentrations of nystatin (0 fig/ml/ 1 /ig/ml, 2 jug/ml, 5 /Lig/ml, 20 /zg/ml respectively) .  On the 4th day, about twenty clones having grown at a concentration of 5 /ug/ml of nystatin were obtained.  Twelve of these clones were sub-cultured on dishes in minimum medium WO (7g/l of "yeast nitrogen base" without amino acids, 20 g/1 of glucose) enriched with uracil, leucine, tryptophan, histidine and<br>
adenine (20 mg/1 each).<br>
The auxotrophy of the adenine due to the disruption of the ADE2 gene was then confirmed by observing the absence of growth on the minimum medium WO described above enriched with uracil, leucine, tryptophan, histidine but free of adenine.<br>
The presence of the expression cassette in the genome of the yeast was controlled by PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of the clones obtained and by using the primers having the sequence SEQ ID No. 6 and SEQ ID No. 7 above.<br>
The functionality of the integrated delta-7Red gene was confirmed by GC analysis of the composition in sterols accumulated in the yeast and extracted by alkaline saponification according to the operating method described in Example IB with a five meter SE 30 capillary column (Alltech).  Analysis shows a modified profile containing sterols saturated in position C-7 when the clones are cultivated in the presence of galactose.  The strain obtained, called ELR01, accumulates ergosta 5 ene 3-ol and ergosta 5,22 diene 3-ol instead of ergosta 5, 7, 22 triene 3-ol (ergosterol), the majority sterol of the initial strain FY1679 as is shown in Figure 7.<br>
The strain ELR01 constructed in this way expresses the delta-7Red gene when it is cultured in the presence of galactose due to the fact of transcriptional control by the promoter GAL10/CYC1.  Although the expression unit for delta-7Red has the same transcription direction as that of the ADE2 gene, no expression of the delta-7Red is detectable by analysis of the composition of sterols by GC when the culture is carried out in the presence of glucose, as a result of the repression of the promoter GAL10/CYC1.<br>
B - Construction of the strain CDR01 containing an expression cassette for the mature form of bovine adrenodoxin reductase (ADRm) integrated between the loci LEU2 and SPL1 of the haploid strain FY1679 mating type alpha (mat. alpha). a) Construction of the shuttle vector E. coli-S. cerevisiae V13<br>
The V13 vector corresponds to the V8 vector (C. Cullin et al., already quoted) which carries the selection indicator<br>
URA3 and an expression cassette in yeast containing the GAL10/CYC1 promoter (pG/C) and in which an additional Sail site (Sa) has been introduced into the multiple cloning site, according to the construction diagram given in Figure 8.<br>
The V8 vector was digested by the restriction enzymes Hindlll and BamHI and the BamHI-Hindlll fragment obtained (1722 pb) containing the URA3 gene and the GAL10/CYC1 promoter (called further on ura-gal"), was sub-cloned between the corresponding sites of the pUC18 vector (Pharmacia) digested by the restriction enzymes Hindlll and BamHI.<br>
The "ura-gal" fragment was then amplified by PCR from 30 ng of the pUCIS/"ura-gal" plasmid obtained denatured for 30 sec. at 95Â°C using the following conditions: 30 cycles; 5 sec. at 86Â°C; 10 sec. at 95Â°C;  40 sec. at 38Â°C; 5 sec. at 55Â°C and 2 min at 74Â°C), 2 units of Tag DNA polymerase (Boehringer) in the manufacturer's buffer and 1/iM of each of the primers having the following nucleotide sequences:<br>
5' GGGGATCCGT GGTCGACGTA ATTTAGTGTG TGTATTTGTG TTTGCG 3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO. 8) and<br>
5' GTAAAACGAC GGCCAGT 3'	(SEQ ID No. 9)<br>
The primer SEQ ID No. 8 contains a BamHI GGATCC site identical to that of the "ura-gal" fragment, 3 consecutive nucleotides at the BamHI site not hybridizing with the template, an Sail GTCGAC site and a sequence homologous to that of the GAL10/CYC1 promoter.  The primer SEQ ID No. 9 matches the sequence preceding the Hind III site of the multiple cloning site pUCIS.  The Hindlll-BamHI fragment of 1722 pb obtained after amplification was digested by Xhol and Bam HI releasing a fragment of 254 bp containing the GAL10/CYC1 promoter (pG/C) which was then sub-cloned in the V8 vector digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI and Xhol.<br>
The resultant V13 vector contains restriction sites allowing easy sub-cloning of the cDNA's coding for mature bovine adrenodoxin reductase (ADRm), mature bovine adrenodoxin (ADXm) and the bovine cytochrome P450SCC.<br><br>
Starting from the V13 vector, the V13-ADR vector, the V13-ADX vector and the V13-SCC10 vector were prepared respectively in the following manner:<br>
a)	Construction of the VI3-ADR vector<br>
A Sall-Kpnl fragment of 1478 pb carrying the cDNA coding for ADRm was isolated from the plasmid pGBADR-2 described in Example 25 of the European Patent Application EP 340878 and sub-cloned in the corresponding sites of the V13 vector to give the V13-ADR vector.<br>
b)	Construction of the V13-ADX vector<br>
A Sail BamHI fragment of 390 pb carrying the cDNA coding for ADXm was isolated from the plasmid pGBADX-1 described in Example 23 of the European Patent Application EP 340878 and sub-cloned in the corresponding sites of the V13 vector to give the V13-ADX vector.<br>
c)	Construction of the V13-SCC10 vector<br>
A Sall-EcoRI fragment of 1554 pb carrying the cDNA coding for P45QSCC was isolated from the plasmid pGBSCC-10 described in Example 6 of the European Patent Application EP 340878 and sub-cloned in the corresponding sites of the V13 vector to give the V13-SCC10 vector.<br>
b) Construction of the integrative plasmids pCD62-l and PCD62-2:<br>
The construction of the plasmids pCD62-l and pCD62-2 was carried out as described in Figure 9.<br>
a) Construction of the plasmid pFL26CD<br>
A NotI site was introduced into the plasmid pFL26 (N. Bonneaud et al., Yeast, 7, 609-615, 1991), in the intergenic region separating the Ieu2 gene from the 5' end of the spll gene (called spll ) (C. Kolman et al., J. Bacteriol., 175, 1433, 1993) according to the following operating method:<br>
Two DNA fragments of 704 bp and 347 bp carryingthe 5' end of Ieu2 and the 3' end of Spll respectively were synthesized by PCR using primers having the following nucleotide sequences:<br>
5' TTGAAGGTTC AACATCAATT GATTG 3'        (SEQ ID No. 10) and<br>
5' GTGTGGCGGC CGCCTCCTTG TCAATATTAA TGTTAAAG 3'<br>
(SEQ ID No. 11)<br>
for the amplification of the 704 bp fragment and the nucleotide sequences<br>
5' CAAGGAGGCG GCCGCCACAC AAAAAGTTAG GTGT 3' (SEQ ID No. 12) and<br>
5' TCTGCTTCCC TAGAACCTTC TTATG 3'	(SEQ ID No. 13)<br>
for the amplification of the 347 bp fragment.<br>
The primers SEQ ID No. 11 and SEQ ID No. 12 have a sequence GGCGGCCG which corresponds to a NotI site and in which 3 bases do not match with the template.  The primer SEQ ID No. 10 matches with a sequence situated 536 bp upstream from the stop codon of Ieu2 and the primer SEQ ID No. 13 with a sequence situated 194 bp upstream that of spllA.<br>
The 704 bp and 347 bp fragments are first amplified by PCR by using the plasmid pFL26 as the template and Pfu DNA polymerase as the enzyme under standard conditions described by the supplier (Stratagene).<br>
The two amplified fragments obtained matched over 20 bp at the level of the ends generated by the primer SEQ ID No. 11 (704 bp fragment) and the primer SEQ ID No. 12 (347 bp fragment) starting from the 5' end; these 20 bp correspond to the first 20 nucleotides of each of these primers respectively.<br>
The product resulting from the pairing of the DNA fragments of 704 bp (1 ng) and 347 bp (2 ng) was amplified using primer SEQ ID No. 10 and SEQ ID No. 13 and the following conditions: 30 cycles of 10 sec. at 95Â°C, 5 sec. at 60Â°C, 1 min at 45Â°C, 5 sec. at 65Â°C and 2 min at 72Â°C followed by a cycle of 7 min at 72Â°C;  50 pmol of each primer and 1 unit of Pfu DNA polymerase in 50 jul of reaction buffer<br>
 (Stratagene).  An amplified fragment of 1031 bp containing a NotI restriction site was obtained.  This fragment was then digested by the BstXI and Nsil enzymes and the fragment of 920 bp obtained, containing the NotI site, was inserted in place of the initial BstXI-Nsil fragment of pFL26 to give the plasmid pFL26CD, whose map is represented in Figure 9a. b) Construction of the plasmid pCD60<br>
-	Preparation of the plasmid pDP10036:<br>
A Sall-BamHI fragment of 390 bp carrying the cDNA coding for mature bovine adrenodoxin (ADXm) was isolated from the plasmid V13-ADX then sub-cloned in the Sall-Bglll sites of the multiple cloning site of the plasmid pTG10033 which is flanked by the inducible promoter GAL10/CYC1 and the terminator ter PGK.  The plasmid pTG10033, whose map is represented in Figure 18 and which corresponds to the expression vector pTG10031 (Figure 17), containing the promoter CYC1 and terPGK, in which the promoter CYC1 has been replaced by the promoter GAL10/CYC1 was prepared according to the operating method described further on.<br>
The plasmid thus obtained, called pDP10034, carries the ADX expression cassette, i.e. the gene coding for ADXm under the transcriptional control of GAL10/CYC1 and terPGK. Subsequently, the term "expression cassette" will be used for any gene under the transcriptional dependence of GAL10/CYC1 and terPGK.<br>
A Hindlll fragment of 3593 bp carrying the selection indicator URA3 and the ADR expression cassette was isolated from the plasmid V13-ADR digested by the restriction enzyme Hindlll then inserted in the corresponding site of plasraid pDP10034 digested by the restriction enzyme Hindlll.  The plasmid obtained, called pDP10036, contains the ADX and ADR expression cassettes separated from each other by the marker URA3 (Figure 9b).<br>
-	Preparation of the plasmid pCD60:<br>
The Afllll-AccI fragment of 2770 bp carrying the ADR cassette was isolated by partial digestion of the plasmid pDP10036 with the restriction enzymes Afllll and AccI, bluntends were created by treatment with the klenow fragment<br>
of DNA polymerase I and sub-cloned after ligation at the blunt ends in the Smal site of the plasmid pBlue-Script KS+ (Stratagene).  In the plasmid obtained, called pCD60, the ADR expression cassette is framed on either side by a NotI site, one situated at 209 bp upstream of the Afllll/Smal ligation site and originating from the sub-cloned fragment and the other originating from the multiple cloning site (MCS1) of pBlue-Script KS+ (Figure 9b).<br>
c) Construction of plasmids pCD62-l and pCD62-2:<br>
The NotI fragment of 2558 bp, isolated from the plasmid pCD60 digested by the restriction enzyme NotI, was then sub-cloned in the single NotI site of the plasmid pFL26CD. Depending on the direction of the insertion of the fragment, two plasmids were obtained, called pCD62-l and pCD62-2 (Figure 9c).<br>
In the plasmid pCD62-l, the ADR expression cassette is -oriented in the direction of the transcription of the Ieu2 gene while this orientation is reversed in the plasmid pCD62-2.<br>
The plasmid pCD62-l was retained for subsequent constructions.<br>
c) Chromosomic integration in the yeast strain FY1679 (Matalpha):<br>
The plasmid pCD62-l contains regions homologous to a chromosomic locus of the strain FY1679.  These regions correspond respectively to fragments Bglll-Clal of 1060 bp (A), EcoRI-NotI of 707 bp (B) and Notl-Bglll of 602 bp (C) indicated in Figure 10.<br>
The region corresponding to the Clal-EcoRI fragment of 486 bp of the plasmid pCD62-l was deleted in the strain FY1679, implying an auxotrophy of this strain vis-a-vis leucine (strain LEU2") (R. S. Sikorski et al., Genetics, 122, 19, 1989).<br>
The plasmid pCD62-l was linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme Xbal whose restriction site is situated outside the homologous regions, then was introduced by transformation in the strain FY1679 (Matalpha) using the lithium acetate method (D. Gietz et al., already quoted).<br>
The cellular repair capacity of the DNA by the yeast ("gap repair") and the selection of recombinants having the phenotype LEU2+ have allowed in the first instance two types of recombinants to be selected: the 1st type is obtained after homologous recombinations at the level of fragments A and B, the 2nd type is obtained after homologous recombinations at the level of fragments A and C.  Only the latter type of recombination allowed the integration of the ADR expression cassette in addition to the restoration of phenotype LEU2+.<br>
To select this 2nd type of clone, a screening by PCR was carried out using the primer SEQ ID No. 10 above and the primer having the following nucleotide sequence:<br>
5' TACATTAGGT CCTTTGTAGC 3'	(SEQ ID No. 14)<br>
so as to confirm both the presence and the correct localization of the ADR expression cassette in the genome of the strain FY1679 (Matalpha).<br>
In this screening, the primer SEQ ID No. 14 exclusively matches the sequence coding for ADRm and the primer SEQ ID No. 10 matches a chromosomic sequence (Figure 10).<br>
The amplification reaction was carried out using as template the genomic DNA (20 ng) isolated from the strain FY1679 (Matalpha) (C. Hoffman et al., Gene, 57, 267, 1987), Taq DNA polymerase (1U, Boehringer), 50 pmol of each primerand 30 PCR cycles (10 sec. at 95Â°C, 1 min at 55Â°C, 3 min at 72Â°C) under the standard conditions described by the supplier.<br>
The amplification led to the isolation of a corresponding fragment of 2.9 kb in the case where the expression cassette has been integrated.  In the opposite case, no amplification product was detected.<br>
The strain FY1679 (Matalpha) selected in this way containing the ADR integrated expression cassette was called CDR01.<br>
The expression of ADR by this strain was revealed from cytosolic cellular fractions prepared according to the<br>
protocol described in Example IF, by immunodetection of the protein recognised by the anti-ADR antibodies.<br>
The functionality of the ADR expressed by the strain CDR01 was confirmed in the enzymatic restriction test of the side chain of cholesterol in vitro described in Example 3 and in which the purified ADR (0.28 pmol) was replaced by a cytosolic cellular fraction of the strain CDR01 containing 100 ug of total proteins.  A bioconversion rate of cholesterol into pregnenolone of approximately 25% was observed, comparable to that obtained with purified ADR. C - Construction of the diploid strain EC01 coexpressing delta-7Red of A. Thaliana and ADRm.<br>
The diploid strain EC01 was obtained by crossing the haploid strains CDR01 and ELR01 obtained above according to the protocol described by G. Sprague et al. (Methods in Enzymology, 194, 77, 1991):<br>
A first selection on minimum medium WO described previously, enriched with uracil, tryptophan and histidine (20 mg/1 each) but free of leucine, allowed the diploid clones LEU2+ (prototrophic character which shows the presence of the ADR expression cassette) to be isolated.  These clones were then tested for their resistance to nystatin at 5 jug/ml (resistance character which shows the presence of the expression cassette for delta-7Red) on the solid synthetic SLI-agar medium described previously.<br>
A strain, called EC01, was in this way arbitrarily isolated from the clones resistant to nystatin. D - Construction of the strain EC01/pCD63 producing pregnenolone and pregnenolone 3-acetate. a) Construction of the expression plasmid pCD63<br>
The construction of the plasmid pCD63 was carried out as described in Figure 11.<br>
The NotI fragment of 4961 bp containing the ADX expression cassette, the selection indicator URA3 and the ADR expression cassette, were isolated from the plasmid pDP10036 prepared above and digested with the restriction enzyme NotI, then cloned in the NotI site of the multiple cloning site of plasmid pFL45L (N. Bonneaud et al., Yeast, 7, 609, 1991).<br>
The vector thus obtained, called pDP10037, is represented in Figure 11.<br>
On the one hand, the plasmid pDP10037 was linearized by digestion with the enzyme Tthllll whose restriction site is situated in the gene coding for ADRm.<br>
On the other hand, a PvuII-EcoRV fragment of 3476 bp containing the expression cassette for P45QSCC and the 5' end of the URA3 marker were purified from the plasmid V13-SCC10 obtained previously and digested with the restriction enzymes PvuII and EcoRV.<br>
The two linear DNA's respectively obtained have homologous regions which correspond on the one hand to the 5' end of the gene URA3 and to GAL10/CYC1, on the other hand to ter PGK as represented in Figure lla.<br>
These two fragments were then introduced into the yeast strain FY1679 (Mata) by co-transformation using the lithium â€¢ acetate method (D. Gietz et al., already quoted).<br>
The following selection of prototrophic recombinants for uracil and tryptophan (URA3+, RTP1+), allowed clones to be isolated in which the double strand break generated by digestion by the restriction enzyme Tthllll has been repaired as a result of the integration of the expression cassette P450SCC by homologous recombination.<br>
Selection of the recombinants (URA3+, RTP1+) was carried out on minimum medium WO enriched with leucine, histidine and leucine (20 mg/1 each) but free from uracil and tryptophan. Starting from 50 collected clones, the total DNA was extracted by the method described by C. Hoffman et al., (Gene, 57, 267, 1987), then introduced by electroporation into the strain of E. coli XLl-Blue (Stratagene).  The clones transformed by the plasmid generated by "gap repair" were selected on the rich medium LB (tryptone 1%, yeast extract 0.5%, NaCl 1%) containing 50 mg/1 of ampicillin.  Starting from one of the selected clones, the plasmid, called pCD63, was extracted according to the method described by J. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.  The plasmid pCD63 obtained contains expression cassettes ADX and P45QSCC separated by the<br>
selection indicator URA3, as represented in Figure lib.<br>
b)	Transformation of the strain EC01 by the plasmid pCD63<br>
The plasmid pCD63 was introduced into the strain EC01 obtained above by transformation by the lithium acetate method (D. Gietz et al., already described).  The transformed yeast was then cultured on the minimum medium WO described previously and free from uracil, tryptophan, adenine and leucine but supplemented with histidine (20 mg/1).<br>
The strain, called EC01/pCD63, was isolated in this way. A sample of the strain, under the reference EC01/pCD63, was deposited at the CNCM on 10th February 1995 under the number 1-1538.<br>
c)	Production in vivo of pregnenolone and pregnenolone 3-<br>
acetate.<br>
The strain EC01/pCD63 was cultured at 28Â°C under aerobic conditions (130 r/min) in a 3-litre Erlenmeyer until the stationary growth phase is reached (D0600 = 12 to 13) in the selective medium SGI described in Example 1A and in which the glucose concentration is 5 g/1.  The culture is then diluted by the addition of a volume of the complete medium YP described above, then the addition of ethanol (0.5% v/v) as a source of carbon. When a new stationary growth phase has been reached (DO600 = 12 to 13), galactose (20 g/1) is added to the culture, in the form of a concentrated solution (500 g/1), so as to simultaneously induce the expression of genes coding for ADXm, ADRm, P450SCC and delta-7 Red which are respectively under the control of the promoter GAL10/CYC1.<br>
The co-expression of the four genes was revealed by analysis of the sterols accumulated in the cells and in the supernatant of the culture respectively according to the following operating method:<br>
50 ml samples of the culture are harvested after 9 hours and 24 hours of induction.  Each sample is centrifuged (4000 g, 10 min, 4Â°C) so as to separate the cells from the culture medium.<br>
On the one hand, the cells are lyzed by mechanical rupture in the presence of glass beads according to the<br>
method indicated in Example IF.  Starting from the lysate thus obtained, the intracellular sterols are then extracted by the addition of a volume of hexane.<br>
On the other hand, the sterols present in the culture medium are extracted directly by the addition of a volume of hexane.<br>
The composition of sterols extracted is analyzed by GC as indicated in Example 1, compared with standard products.<br>
The results obtained after 9 hours or after 24 hours of induction are shown in Figure 12a and in Figure 12b respectively. After 9 hours of induction, Figure 12a shows:<br>
-	in the cellular lysate, the presence of a majority compound<br>
having an identical retention time to that of standard<br>
pregnenolone acetate (RT =11.8 min) while only a very weak<br>
peak is present at the retention time of the pregnenolone (RT<br>
= 9.9 min).  Low quantities of endogenic sterols of the yeast<br>
reduced in position C-7 (ergosta 5-ene 3-ol and ergosta 5,22<br>
diene 3-ol) are identified respectively at RT = 18 min and RT<br>
= 17 min.  The alkaline saponification of the cellular lysate<br>
before analysis leads to the presence of a majority compound<br>
co-migrating with the pregnenolone.  This allows confirmation<br>
that the accumulated compound having an RT of 11.8 min<br>
corresponds to pregnenolone acetate.<br>
-	in the culture medium, the significant absence of<br>
pregnenolone or its acetate.<br>
After 24 hours of induction, Figure 12b shows:<br>
-	in the cellular lysate, the presence of low quantities of<br>
pregnenolone (RT =10.2 min) and of pregnenolone acetate (RT<br>
= 12 min) as well as of reduced endogenic sterols of the<br>
yeast (RT = 17 min and RT = 18 min).  The cholesterol (RT =<br>
16.2 min) is an internal standard added before the<br>
extraction.<br>
-	in the culture medium, the majority presence of<br>
pregnenolone acetate and a minor quantity of pregnenolone.<br>
The experiments carried out in parallel with the strain EC01 transformed by a control plasmid such as pFL45L already quoted, have shown no peak corresponding to free pregnenolone<br>
or pregnenolone in the acetate form.<br>
Identification of the sterols carried out in this way shows that the yeast strain EC01/pCD63 has accumulated the pregnenolone and the pregnenolone acetate in the absence of any source of exogenic sterols, after induction in the presence of galactose with a major production after an induction of 9 hours.<br>
These results demonstrate on the one hand the effective mobilization of the endogenic sterols reduced in position C-7 of the strain EC01, on the other hand the extreme effectiveness of the coupling of the restriction reaction of the side chain of the endogenic sterols.<br>
Preparation of Example 4: construction of the plasmid PT610033<br>
1.  Derivative of pUC19 having a new multiple cloning site:<br>
The cloning vector M13mpl9 (C. Yanish-Peron et al., Gene, 33, 103, 1985) was mutagenized using the following oligonucleotide:<br>
5' GCGCTCAGCG GCCGCTTTCC AGTCG 3'	SEQ ID No. 15<br>
to introduce a NotI site into the sequence of the truncated lacl gene and to give the plasmid M13TG724.<br>
A "polylinker11 containing the EcoRI, SnaBI and NotI sites was then introduced into the EcoRI site of the plasmid M13TG724 by using the following oligonucleotides:<br>
5' AATTGCGGCC GCGTACGTAT G3'	SEQ ID No,16<br>
and<br>
5' AATTCATACG TACGCGGCCG C 3'	SEQ ID No. 17<br>
to give the plasmid M13TG7244 in which a modification of the insert was observed during the amplification stage.  The insert of the plasmid M13TG7244 has the following nucleotide sequence:<br>
GAATTCATACGTACGCGGCCGCAATTGCGGCCGGTACGTATAATTCACrGGCCGr<br>
in which the EcoRI, SnaBI and SstI sites are underlined and the lacZ sequence of pUC19 is in italics.<br>
After digestion of the plasmid M13TG7244 by the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SstI, a "polylinker11 containing the Mlul and Avrll sites was introduced using the following oligonucleotides:<br>
5' CAACGCGTCC TAGG 3'	SEQ ID No. 18<br>
and<br>
5' AATTCCTAGG ACGCGTTGAG CT 3'	SEQ ID No. 19.<br>
After digestion with the enzyme PvuII, the PvuII fragment obtained was sub-cloned in pUC19 (C. Yanish-Porch et al. already quoted) to give the plasmid pTG7457 (Figure 13).<br>
2.	Sub-cloning of the PGK terminator:<br>
pUC19 was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI and a new "polylinker" BamHI SstI was introduced using the following oligonucleotides:<br>
5' GATCCGCAGA TATCATCTAG ATCCCGGGTA GAT 3'   SEQ ID No. 20,<br>

The plasmid pTG7453 was obtained in this way (Figure 14) then was digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI and SstI. The sites of the "polylinker11 between BamHI and SstI were introduced into a derivative of plasmid pTG7457 obtained above and digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI and SstI. The new plasmid obtained contains the PvuII, Hindlll, BamHI, EcoRI, Xbal, Smal, Bglll, SstI (=SacI), Mlul, Avrll, EcoRI, SnaBI, NotI, SnaBI, Pvul sites.<br>
This new plasmid was digested by the restriction enzymes Bglll and Hindlll and a Bglll-Hindlll fragment containing the PGK promoter (R. A. Hitzeman et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 10, 7791, 1982;  G. Loison et al., Yeast, 5, 497, 1989) was inserted in the former to give the plasmid pTG10014 (Figure 15).<br>
3.	Sub-cloning of promoters:<br>
a) the CYC1 promoter<br>
The sites of the "polylinker" between BamHI and SstI of the plasmid pTG7453 were introduced into a derivative of the plasmid pTG7457 as indicated above.  The new plasmid obtained was restricted by the restriction enzyme SnaBI, then the<br>
Rsal-Dral fragment of 456bp of the plasmid pEMBLS (L. Dente et al., Nucleic Acid Res., 11, 1645, 1983) containing the origin of replication of the phage fl was introduced to give the plasmid pTG7503.<br>
The BamHI Hindlll fragment of 0.78 kb of the plasmid pGBSCC-9, prepared in Example 6 of the European Patent Application EP 0340378 and containing the CYC1 promoter of S. cerevisiae, a "polylinker" and the lactase terminator of K.lactis, was sub-cloned in the plasmid pTG7503 digested with the restriction enzymes Hindlll and BamHI to give the plasmid PTG10004 (Figure 16).<br>
The Xhol and Mlul sites of the CYC1 promoter were then eliminated by site directed mutagenesis of the double strand DNA of the plasmid pTG10004 using the following oligonucleotide:<br>
5' GCGGATCTGC TCGAAGATTG CCTGCGCGTT GGGCTTGATC 3'<br>
SEQ ID NO. 24.<br>
The plasmid pTGlOOOS thus obtained was then digested by the restriction enzymes Sail and Xhol then a Mlul site was introduced by using the following oligonucleotides:<br>
5' TCGACGGACG CGTGG 3'	SEQ ID No. 25<br>
and<br>
5' TCGACCACGC GTCC 3'	SEQ ID No. 26<br>
to give the plasmid pTG10006.<br>
b) the GAL10/CYC1 promoter<br>
The plasmid pYeDPl/8-2 (C. Cullin et al., Gene, 203, 1988) was opened with the restriction enzyme Xhol.  The cohesive ends created were filled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase then the plasmid was religated.  The plasmid pTGlOOlO thus obtained in which the GAL10/CYC1 promoter no longer contains the Xhol site is used as a template for a PCR amplification.<br>
4.  Construction of the expression vector pTG10031<br>
The remaining part of the sequence coding for lacZ was eliminated in the plasmid pTG7503 by site directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotide:<br>
5' TGGCCGTCGT TTTACTCCTG CGCCTGATGC GGTAT 3' SEQ ID No. 27<br>
to give the plasmid pTG7549.<br>
The LacZ promoter present in the plasmid pTG7549 wasthen deleted using the following oligonucleotides:<br>
5' GGCCGCAAAA CCAAA 3'	SEQ ID No. 28 and<br>
5' AGCTTTTGGT TTTGC 3'	SEQ ID No. 29<br>
which are inserted in the plasmid digested beforehand by the restriction enzymes NotI and Hindlll and which restore the two sites to give the plasmid pTG7553.<br>
A BamHI Mlul fragment containing the CYC1 promoter was obtained from the plasmid pTG10006 digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI and Mlul and a Mlul Hindlll fragment containing the PGK promoter was isolated from the plasmid pTG10015 digested by the restriction enzymes Mlul and Hindlll.  These two fragments were ligated and the ligation product obtained was inserted in the plasmid pTG7553 digested beforehand by the restriction enzymes Mlul and Hindlll.<br>
The following oligonucleotide:<br>
5' GATCTATCGA TGCGGCCGCG 3'	SEQ ID No. 30<br>
hybridized with the following oligonucleotide:<br>
5' CGCGCGCGGC CGCATCGATA 3'	SEQ ID No. 31<br>
which constitutes a BamHI Mlul "linker" containing the Clal and NotI sites, was added and ligated to give the expression vector pTG 10031 (Figure 17).<br>
The fragment amplified by PCR obtained above from the plasmid pYeDPl/8-2 was digested with the restriction enzymes Clal and Sail then was introduced into the plasmid pTG10031 digested beforehand with the same restriction enzymes to give the plasmid pTG10033 (Figure 18).<br>
