				<td>Power Theft Detection System<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The invention relates to a system for detecting power theft, taking place anywhere in an electricity distribution network.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
The theft of electrical energy has always been a major issue for all electricity distributing agencies. The agencies still rely on old methods for checking theft. The energy meters are installed at the usage site and usage data is periodically collected. There are many ways through which these energy meters installed at sites can be bypassed while using the electricity. Earlier the meters used for measurement of electricity could have been easily tampered. Although introduction of electronic energy meters has stopped the tampering of meters, thieves have found other ways to bypass the meter and still steal electricity. In developing countries like India, this power theft results in huge loss of revenues for the power distributing agencies as well as government. The methods used by these agencies for preventing power theft is very preliminary, limited in their scope and tend to be very expensive in the long run. Following chart will give an overview of methods that are being employed and their effectiveness.<br>
Some of the advanced methods currently being used to prevent power theft is check<br>
meters, Tap detectors, Flux monitors and A.M.R. Meters (which support automated meter<br>
reading).  Although, these systems are use latest technology,  they have their own<br>
drawbacks.<br>
The drawbacks that can be easily observed in aforementioned systems are:<br>
•	None of these systems can detect all kinds of theft.<br>
•	Check meters, Tap detectors and flux monitors can be used in a local zone only and are generally used to prove any suspected consumer, guilty of power theft.<br>
•	These systems require high maintenance cost.<br>
•	No record can be kept about, when and where the theft took place.<br>
•	In case of AMR meters changing the old meters with new electronic meters for all the consumers requires in huge installation cost.<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
The object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a power theft detection system in an electricity distribution network comprising:<br>
-	a server provided at the power station,<br>
-	said server is connected to plurality of nodes that provide power to the pole network under the control of said power station,<br>
-	each pole of said network is provided with a pole meter having plurality of electricity measuring units and at least one electronic device for storing the data of said measuring units,<br>
-	said electricity measuring units are connected to corresponding power line to the end user's electricity meter.<br>
the arrangement between the electricity measuring units and said electronic device being such that the electronic device stores the data of said measuring units and transmits to the server where the data of user's electricity meter is compared with the data of said measuring units to detect theft.<br>
The said electronic device is a microcontroller embedded with a program to control and store the data of the electricity measuring units.<br>
The said pole meter is a three-phase meter.<br>
Additional microcontrollers are provided on the poles for continuous communication between the poles of the network to prevent the theft in between the poles.<br>
The said additional microcontrollers are embedded with different programs to communicate with microcontrollers of the parent poles to detect the theft between the poles.<br>
The data of user's electricity meter is taken manually.<br>
The data of said measuring units is taken by remote control means from the poles through said microcontroller, or any of the methods herein described.<br>
The pole meters are connected to power lines through sealed boxes.<br>
Each measuring unit is provided with a distinct ID by the microcontroller to identify the consumer.<br>
The data of said measuring units is transmitted directly to the server through the power line, radio frequency or wire connection means.<br>
The communication between the microcontrollers is either by power line, radio frequency or wire connection means.<br>
The user's electricity meter is the existing meter to save the cost.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying drawings:<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig.l shows a part of electricity distribution network with pole meters installed on the<br>
poles.<br>
Fig.2 shows three poles A, B, C from the distribution network and connection between<br>
the pole meters a, b, c installed on pole.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a pole meter according to this invention in a detailed way.<br>
Fig.4 shows two pole meters 'a' and 'b' according to this invention and connection for<br>
electronic communication between them.<br>
Fig.5 shows a pole with a pole meter and its connections to power lines.<br>
Fig.6 shows an electricity-measuring unit.<br>
Detailed description:<br>
Fig. 1 is the diagram of a part of electricity distribution network. The network consists of poles P, Q, R, A, B, C and pole meters p, q, r, a, b, c are installed on the poles respectively. The poles (nodes) carry the power line. The pole through which power is supplied to adjacent poles is called the parent pole whereas the adjacent poles that receive the power are called daughter poles. In Fig. 1, pole P is parent pole of daughter poles Q and R. Pole R is parent pole of A. Similarly pole A is parent pole of daughter poles B and C. Accordingly the pole meter that resides on the parent pole is called parent pole meter and pole meters on daughter poles are called daughter pole meters. Thus in Fig. 1 'p' is parent pole meter of pole meters 'q' and 'r'. Similarly, in fig. 2, pole meter 'a' is parent pole meter of pole meter 'b' and 'c'. The originating point of whole distribution network (consisting of all the pole meters) is connected to power house and communication is done to a server located centrally, preferably at power house. Each pole can be said a node.<br>
The pole meter (see fig. 3) further consists of microcontrollers 1, 2 and 3. The microcontroller 1 is connected with different energy measuring units (Dl, D2, D3,....D16) through which power is supplied to consumers. P1, P2, P3—Pn are ports through which power is taken to consumers. The other two controllers 2 and 3 are connected to three-phase energy metering units E2 and E3. Microcontrollers 2 and 3 also communicate to the microcontrollers in the parent pole as well as daughter pole. The fig.2 shows connection between pole meters using RS 485 communication in case it is used. The figure 5 shows the connection between pole meter and the three-phase power lines such that the whole connection is in a sealed box so that power theft cannot take place.<br>
Microcontroller 1 is connected to different energy metering units to monitor the power usage by individual end user (consumer). Energy measuring units are connected to said 'ports' through which power will be supplied to consumers. The microcontrollers are depicted by notation 'a-r,'a-2','a-3'....'c-r,'c-2','c-3' depending on the notation by which the concerned pole meter is shown. Thus, notation 'c-1' means microcontroller 1 of pole meter 'c'. Similar notation is used for microcontrollers in other pole meters.<br>
The Working method:<br>
The basic idea behind the invention is to calculate the total inflow of electrical energy against total outflow of electrical energy. The whole process is further divided in two processes that run simultaneously, i.e.<br>
a.)   Detection of theft between two poles of the distribution network. This type of<br>
theft is detected in real time, b.)  Detection of theft between pole and the electricity connection at the consumer end. This type of theft is detected during month end reading.<br>
Detection of theft in the pole wire network<br>
To understand the working of the system, we take a small part of distribution network as<br>
shown in fig.l. The considered part of the network is also shown in fig.2. It consists of<br>
poles A, B and C. with pole meters 'a','b' and 'c' installed on the poles respectively. It also<br>
shows the connection between pole meters through communication lines through dotted<br>
lines.<br>
The microcontroller '3' in pole A i.e. 'a-3' calculates the total outflow of power going through pole A and being distributed to pole B and pole C. The microcontrollers '2' on pole B i.e. 'b-2' and pole C i.e. 'c-2' receive this power and acknowledge the amount they received to the microcontroller 'a-3'<br>
Supposing that,<br>
Pout A = Total power outflow from pole A.<br>
Pin B = Total power received and acknowledged by pole B.<br>
Pin c = Total power received and acknowledged by pole C.<br>
Elosses = Error limit provided to take into account, the losses occurred during distribution.<br>
Then microcontroller 'a-3' will use the following formula to check any discrepancy in power distribution.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The amount of power acknowledged by 'b-2' and 'c-2' is conveyed to microcontroller 'a-3' and it must not differ from the value of power outflow as calculated by itself by more than a specified tolerance value (Eiosses). If it differs by more than that, a theft flag is raised for pole meter at pole A using the microcontroller 'a-3' and this is communicated to the central server in real time along with pole meter ID and amount of theft. The communication can be done using RS-485 communication or Power line carrier communication or in short P.L.C.C. described herein. Both methods of electronic communication are ingenious methods of communicating data on a network and can be chosen, based on their cost effectiveness and efficiency. On receiving theft flag from the pole meter, the central server prepares a descriptive report of when and where the theft is taking place. The software at server does the necessary processing using the pole meter's ID to make out the place where theft is taking place. It also gives details about amount of theft. Thus, if there is any theft or leakage of power taking place between two poles, it can easily be detected.<br>
Detection of theft in the wire soins from pole to individual users<br>
The process of detection of theft in this case is explained with reference to fig 3. The power supply to individual user is taken from the 'ports' Pl,P2,P3...Pn in pole meter after it is acknowledged by microcontroller '2' and before it goes from microcontroller '3' as shown in fig 3. The energy metering unit like Dl,D2....Dn attached to the wire, carrying the power, measures the power supplied to each individual user. These readings are stored by microcontroller 1 with the corresponding energy-metering unit's ID and thus the pole meter keeps track of power supplied to individuals. As the whole pole meter system is enclosed in a sealed box, no theft can take place from the box directly. Power ports (rods) such as PI, P2....Pn are projected from pole meter, which supplies power to each individual consumer. The reading from pole meter is collected on month end. The month end data can be collected in various communication ways, which are:<br>
a.) Using a remote control device, which can get data from pole meter either through wireless communication or by plugging it in the pole meter. Later, this remote device feeds this data to the central server.<br>
b.) Using RS-485 communication over the poles. Here the data will be transferred to the central server on month end using RS-485 communication. RS-485 is a protocol of electronic communication, which is used widely in networks for transferring data. (More information about RS-485 can be obtained from 'www.rs485.com'.<br>
c.) Using Power Line Career Communication (P.L.C.C.).Here the data is carried through the wires that carry the power. P.L.C.C. is an emerging technology in communication of data electronically in a network. The method can be used to transfer the data from pole meter to central servers on month end. (More information on PLCC is given at 'http://personal.vsnl.com/lathish/digital_plcc2.htmr)<br>
d.) By taking the help of existing network of phone lines and using the network of telephone lines for communication of data on month end. Telephones lines can be connected through modems to send the data electronically.<br>
e.) Using wireless technology. The poles can either directly transfer the data to the central server through wireless communication. Or they can communicate to the server through their wireless network.<br>
Any of these methods can be used for collecting month end reading of each consumer. The best method can be chosen, based on their efficiency, cost-effectiveness and other factors, that may differ in region to region or from time to time.<br>
This data from pole meter, for each consumer is fed into central server. Along with, the actual month end reading is collected from the energy meters installed at individual consumer's site. This actual reading is also fed to the central server. The server now compares the data collected from the pole wire network and the actual reading taken from<br><br><br><br><br><br>
