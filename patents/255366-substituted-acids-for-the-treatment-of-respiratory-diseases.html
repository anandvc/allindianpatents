Certain compounds of formula (I) Ne capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It will be understood that the invention encompasses all geometric and optical isomers of the compounds of formula (I) and mixtures thereof including racemates. Tautomers and mixtures thereof also form an aspect of the present invention.<br>
The compound of formula (I) above may be converted to a phNmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, preferably a basic addition salt such as sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, lithium, magnesium, zinc, benzathine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethanolamine, ethyldiamine, meglumine, tromethamine, tertiNy-butylamine and procaine, or an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, rumNate, maleate, tNtrate, citrate, oxalate, methanesulphonate or j3-toluenesulphonate.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the Nt that in the processes of the present invention certain functional groups hi the stNting reagents or intermediate compound may need to be protected by protecting groups. Thus, the prepNation of the compound of formula (I) may involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups. The protection and deprotection of functional groups is fully described hi 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J. W. F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 3rd edition, T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (1999).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be prepNed by reaction of a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which T = S or NR13 and W, X, Y and Z Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof, with a compound of formula (in):<br>
L-CR1R2CO2R14  (HI)<br>
Where R1 and R2 Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof, R14 is H or C1-C10 alkyl group and L is a leaving group, and optionally thereafter in any order:<br>
•	removing any protecting group<br>
•	hydrolysing the ester group R14 to the corresponding acid<br>
•	oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides or sulphones<br>
•	forming a phNmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
The reaction can be cNried out in a suitable solvent such as ethanol using a base such as sodium acetate, cNbonate or the like. Suitable groups R14 include C1-6 alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl. Suitable L is a leaving group such as triflate or halo, in pNticulN<br>
chlorine or bromine. L may also be hydroxy so that a Mitsunobu reaction may be performed with compound (II) using for example triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicNboxylate.<br>
Hydrolysis of the ester group R14 can be cNried out using routine procedures, for example treatment of methyl and ethyl esters with aqueous sodium hydroxide, and treatment of tert-butyl esters with acids such as trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be prepNed by reaction of a compound of formula (IV) with a compound of formula (V):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1, R2, X, Y and Z Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof and W = S, NR13 or O. L1 is halogen, activated alcohol such as triflate or alkyl sulphone or sulphoxide.<br>

Compounds of formula (VI) may be prepNed using the general route A:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which W = O, S or NR13 and X, Y and Z Ne as defined hi formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof. The first step can be cNried out in a suitable solvent such as DMF with a base such as potassium cNbonate, preferably at elevated temperatures. The nitro group can then be reduced to the aniline using a suitable reducing agent such as iron in acetic acid or hydrogenation.<br>
The steps can be reversed as outlined in Route A (i):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Route A (i)<br>
hi which L1 is a leaving group, W = O, S or NR13 and X, Y and Z Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof. The nitro group is reduced first to the aniline using a suitable reducing agent such as iron in acetic acid or hydrogenation. The second step introduces the group 'Z', which can be cNried out in a suitable solvent such as DMF with a base such as potassium cNbonate, preferably at elevated temperatures.<br>
Compounds of formula (I), where T = CR1R2, may be prepNed using the general route B:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Route B<br>
in which L is a leaving group, W = O, S or NR13 and X, Y and Z Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof. The first step can be cNried out in a suitable solvent such as DMF with a base such as potassium cNbonate, preferably at elevated temperatures. The formyl group can then be reduced to the alcohol using a suitable reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in ethanol. The alcohol can be converted into a leaving group such as a mesylate, using methanesulphonyl chloride and triethylamine and displaced with the anion of a dialkylmalonate. The diester can be decNboxylated with sodium chloride in DMSO/water at elevated temperatures.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (W), where T = CR1R2 and W=O maybe prepNed using the general route B (i):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Route B (i)<br>
in which X, Y and Z Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof. P is a protecting group such as benzyl. The first step can be cNried out in a suitable solvent such as DMF with a dealkylating agent such as lithium chloride, preferably at elevated temperatures. The alcohol group can then be protected using a suitable protecting reagent such as bromobenzyl The formyl group can be converted into an alkene using the Homer-Wadsworth Emmons procedure, reacting with a phosphonate group in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride. The corresponding alkene is reduced and the protecting group removed in one step using a suitable reduction method such as hydrogenation.<br>
Some compounds of formula (IV), where T = CR1R2 can be prepNed by general method B (ii):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Route B (ii)<br>
in which L is a leaving group, W, X, Y and Z Ne as defined in formula (I) or Ne protected derivatives thereof. The first reaction can be cNried out with a suitable alkene using a palladium catalyst, in a suitable solvent such as DMF.<br>
Some compounds of formula (I), where T = CR1R2 and W is O, can be prepNed by general method B (iii):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Route B (iii)<br>

PhNmacological Data<br>
Ligand Binding Assay<br>
[3H]PGD2 was purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences with a specific activity of 100-210Ci/mmol. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.<br>
HEK cells expressing rhCRTh2 / Gccl6 were routinely maintained in DMEM containing 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (HyClone), Img/ml geneticin, 2mM L-glutamine and 1% non-essential amino acids. For the prepNation of membranes, the adherent transfected HEKcells were grown to confluence in two layer tissue culture factories (Fisher, catalogue number TKT-170-070E). Maximal levels of receptor expression were induced by addition of 500mM sodium butyrate for the last 18 hours of culture. The adherent cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50ml per cell factory) and detached by the addition of 50ml per cell factory of ice-cold membrane homogenisation buffer [20mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1mM dithiothreitol, ImM EDTA, 0.lmM phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride and 100µg/ml bacitracin]. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4°C, re-suspended in half the original volume of fresh membrane homogenisation buffer and disrupted using a Pblytron homogeniser for 2 x 20 second bursts keeping the tube in ice at all tunes. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4°C and the membrane fraction pelleted by centrifugation at 90000xg for 30 minutes at 4°C, The final<br>
pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of membrane homogenisation buffer per cell factory used and the protein content determined. Membranes were stored at -80°C in suitable aliquots.<br>
All assays were performed in Coming cleN bottomed, white 96-well NBS plates (Fisher). Prior to assay, the HEK cells membranes containing CRTh2 were coated onto SPA PYT WGA beads (Amersham). For coating membranes were incubated with beads at typically 25µg membrane protein per mg beads at 4°C with constant agitation overnight. (The optimum coating concentrations were determined for each batch of membranes) The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (800xg for 7minutes at 4°C), washed once with assay buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 5mM magnesium chloride) and finally re-suspended in assay buffer at a bead concentration of 10mg/ml.<br>
Each assay contained 20µl of 6.25nM [3H]PGD2, 20µl membrane saturated SPA b eads both in assay buffer and 10µl of compound solution or 13,14-d1Hydro-15-keto prostaglandin D2 (DK-PGD2, for determination of non-specific binding, Cayman chemical company). Compounds and DK-PGD2 were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the same solvent to 100x the required final concentration. Assay buffer was added to give a final concentration of 10% DMSO (compounds were now at 10x the required final concentration) and this was the solution added to the assay plate. The assay plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and counted on a Wallac Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (1 minute per well).<br>
