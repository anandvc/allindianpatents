TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to inhibitors of RNA dependent RNA polymerases, particularly those viral polymerases within the Flaviviridae family, more particularly to HCV polymerase.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
About 30,000 new cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are estimated to, occur in the United States each year (Kolykhalov, A.A.; Mihalik, K.; Feinstone, S.M.; Rice, CM.; 2000; J. Virol. 74: 2046-2051). HCV is not easily cleared by the hosts' immunological defences; as many as 85% of the people infected with HCV become chronically infected. Many of thes^ persistent infections result in chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hoofnagle, J.H.; 1997; Hepatology 26; 15S-20S*). There are an estimated 170 million HCV carriers world-wide, and HCV-associated end-stage liver disease is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. In the United States alone, hepatitis C is responsible for 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually. Without effective intervention, the number is expected to triple in the next 10 to 20 years. There is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection. Prolonged treatment of chronically infected patients with interferon or interferon and ribavirin is the only currently approved therapy, but it achieves a sustained response in fewer than 50% of cases (Lindsay, K.L.; 1997; Hepatology 26: 71S-77S*, and Reichard, O.; Schvarcz, R.; Weiland, O.; 1997 Hepatology 26:108S-111S*).<br>
HCV belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus hepacivirus, which comprises three genera of small enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses (Rice, CM.; 1996; "Flaviviridae: the viruses and their replication"; pp. 931-960 in Fields Virology, Fields, B.N.; Knipe, D.M.; Howley, P.M. (eds.); Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia Pa. *). The 9.6 kb genome of HCV consists of a long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5' and 3' non-translated regions (NTR's). The HCV 5' NTR is 341 nucleotides in length and functions as an internal ribosome entry site for cap-independent translation initiation (Lemon, S.H.; Honda, M.; 1997; Semin. Virol. 8: 274-288). The HCV polyprotein is cleaved co- and post-translationally into at least 10 individual polypeptides (Reed, K.E.; Rice, CM.; 1999; Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 242: 55-84*). The structural proteins result from signal peptidases in the N-<br>
terminal portion of the polyprotein. Two viral proteases mediate downstream<br>
cleavages to produce non-structural (NS) proteins that function as components of<br>
the HCV RNA replicase. The NS2-3 protease spans the C-terminal half of the NS2<br>
and the N-terminal one-third of NS3 and catalyses cis cleavage of the NS2/3 site.<br>
The same portion of NS3 also encodes the catalytic domain of the NS3-4A serine<br>
protease that cleaves at four downstream sites. The C-terminal two-thirds of NS3 is<br>
highly conserved amongst HCV isolates, with RNA-binding, RNA-stimulated<br>
NTPase, and RNA unwinding activities. Although NS4B and the NS5A<br>
phosphoprotein are also likely components of the replicase, their specific roles are<br>
unknown. The C-terminal polyprotein cleavage product, NS5B, is the elongation<br>
subunit of the HCV replicase possessing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)<br>
activity (Behrens, S.E.; Tomei, L; DeFrancesco, R.; 1996; EMBOJ. 15:12-22*; and<br>
Lohmann, V.; Korner, F.; Herian, U.; Bartenschlager, R.; 1997; J. Virol. 71: 8416-<br>
8428*). It has been recently demonstrated that mutations destroying NS5B activity<br>
abolish infectivity of RNA in a chimp model (Kolykhalov, A.A.; Mihalik, K.; Feinstone,<br>
S.M.; Rice, C.M.; 2000; J. Virol. 74: 2046-2051*).<br>
The development of new and specific anti-HCV treatments is a high priority, and<br>
virus-specific functions essential for replication are the most attractive targets for<br>
drug development. The absence of RNA dependent RNA polymerases in mammals,<br>
and the fact that this enzyme appears to be essential to viral replication, would<br>
suggest that the NS5B polymerase is an ideal target for anti-HCV therapeutics.<br>
WO 00/06529, WO 00/13708, WO 00/10573, WO 00/18231, WO 01/47883,<br>
WO 01/85172 and WO 02/04425 report inhibitors of NS5B proposed for treatment of<br>
HCV.<br>

Included within the scope of this invention are all compounds of formula I as<br>
presented in Tables 1 to 8.<br>
Preferred compounds according to this invention are listed in the tables. Particularly<br>
compounds of these tables are preferred which show an IC50 value of below 200 nM,<br>
as for example those compounds included in the claims 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55.<br>
Polymerase activity<br>
The ability of the compounds of formula (I) to inhibit RNA synthesis by the RNA<br>
dependent RNA polymerase of HCV can be demonstrated by any assay capable of<br>
measuring RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity. A suitable assay is described<br>
in the examples.<br>
Specificity for RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity<br>
To demonstrate that the compounds of the invention act by specific inhibition of HCV<br>
polymerase, the compounds may be tested for inhibitory activity in a DNA dependent<br>
RNA polymerase assay.<br>
When a compound of formula (I), or one of its therapeutically acceptable salts, is<br>
employed as an antiviral agent, it is administered orally, topically or systemically to<br>
mammals, e.g. humans, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits or mice, in a vehicle<br>
comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, the proportion of<br>
which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen<br>
route of administration and standard biological practice.<br>
For oral administration, the compound or a therapeutically acceptable salt thereof<br>
can be formulated in unit dosage forms such as capsules or tablets each containing<br>
-99-<br>
a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, ranging from about 25 to 500 mg,<br>
in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
For topical administration, the compound can be formulated in pharmaceutically<br>
accepted vehicles containing 0.1 to 5 percent, preferably 0.5 to 5 percent, of the<br>
active agent. Such formulations can be in the form of a solution, cream or lotion.<br>
For parenteral administration, the compound of formula (I) is administered by either<br>
intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, in compositions with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or carriers. For administration by injection, it is<br>
preferred to use the compounds in solution in a sterile aqueous vehicle which may<br>
also contain other solutes such as buffers or preservatives as well as sufficient<br>
quantities of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or of glucose to make the solution<br>
isotonic.<br>
Suitable vehicles or carriers for the above noted formulations are described in<br>
pharmaceutical texts, e.g. in "Remington's The Science and Practice of Pharmacy",<br>
19th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Penn., 1995, or in "Pharmaceutical<br>
Dosage Forms And Drugs Delivery Systems", 6th ed., H.C. Ansel et al., Eds.,<br>
Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore, Maryland, 1995.<br>
The dosage of the compound will vary with the form of administration and the<br>
particular active agent chosen. Furthermore, it will vary with the particular host under<br>
treatment. Generally, treatment is initiated with small increments until the optimum<br>
effect under the circumstance is reached. In general, the compound of formula I is<br>
most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford<br>
antivirally effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects.<br>
For oral administration, the compound or a therapeutically acceptable salt is<br>
administered in the range of 10 to 200 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, with<br>
a preferred range of 25 to 150 mg per kilogram.<br>
For systemic administration, the compound of formula (I) is administered at a dosage<br>
of 10 mg to 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, although the<br>
aforementioned variations will occur. A dosage level that is in the range of from<br>
about 10 mg to 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day is most desirably<br>
employed in order to achieve effective results.<br>
When the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of a compound of<br>
formula I and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agent, both the<br>
compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between<br>
about 10 to 100%, and more preferably between about 10 and 80% of the dosage<br>
normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.<br>
When these compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are formulated<br>
together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the resulting composition may<br>
be administered in vivo\o mammals, such as man, to inhibit HCV polymerase or to<br>
treat or prevent HCV virus infection. Such treatment may also be achieved using the<br>
compounds of this invention in combination with agents which include, but are not<br>
limited to: immunomodulatory agents, such as a-, P-, or y-interferons; other antiviral<br>
agents such as ribavirin, amantadine; other inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase;<br>
inhibitors of other targets in the HCV life cycle, which include but are not limited to,<br>
helicase, NS2/3 protease, NS3 protease, or internal ribosome entry site (IRES); or<br>
combinations thereof. The additional agents may be combined with the compounds<br>
of this invention to create a single dosage form. Alternatively these additional agents<br>
may be separately administered to a mammal as part of a multiple dosage form.<br>
Methodology and Synthesis<br>
Indole derivatives or analogs according to the present invention can be prepared<br>
from known monocyclic aromatic compounds by adapting known literature<br>
sequences such as those described by J.W. Ellingboe et al. (Tet. Lett. 1997, 38,<br>
7963) and S. Cacchi et al. (Tet. Lett. 1992, 33, 3915). Scheme 1, shown below<br>
wherein R1, R2, Sp, Y and L are as described herein, illustrate how these procedures<br>
can be adapted to the synthesis of compounds of formula I of this invention.<br>
In carrying out the route illustrated in Scheme 1, a suitably protected form of 3-<br>
trifluoroacetamido-4-iodobenzoic acid l(i) is reacted with an alkyne l(ii) in the<br>
presence of a metal catalyst (e.g. a palladium metal complex such as PdCI2(PPh3)2,<br>
Pd2dba3, Pd(PPh3)4 and the like), a base (Et3N, DIEA and the like or an inorganic<br>
basic salt including metal carbonates, fluorides and phosphates), and optionally in<br>
the presence of an additional phosphine ligand (triaryl or heteroarylphosphine, dppe,<br>
dppf, dppp and the like). Suitable solvents for this reaction include DMF, dioxane,<br>
THF, DME, toluene, MeCN, DMA and the like at temperatures ranging from 20 °C to<br>
170 °C, or alternatively without solvent by heating the components together.<br>
Alternatively, the cross-coupling reaction can be carried out on a suitably protected<br>
form of 3-amino-4-iodobenzoate and the amino group can be trifluoroacetylated in<br>
the subsequent step as described by J.W. Ellingboe et al. (Tet. Lett. 1997, 38, 7963).<br>
Reaction of the above diarylalkynes l(iii) with an enol triflate or equivalent under<br>
cross-coupling conditions similar to those described above gives after hydrogenation<br>
of the double bond, indole derivatives l(iv). Enol Inflates are known and can be<br>
prepared from the corresponding ketones by following known literature methods (for<br>
example, cyclohexene triflate can be prepared from cyclohexanone, triflic anhydride<br>
and a hindered organic base such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine). The<br>
hydrogenation of the double bond originally present in R3 can be carried out with<br>
hydrogen gas or a hydrogen donor (ammonium formate, formic acid and the like) in<br>
the presence of a metal catalyst (preferably Pd) in a suitable solvent (lower alkyl<br>
alcohols, THF etc.).<br>
The indole derivative l(iv) is then alkylated on nitrogen with an appropriate spacer<br>
(Sp) and further elaborated if necessary to give AAalkylated indole carboxylates<br>
where Y, Sp and L are as defined herein.<br>
Finally, following hydrolysis of the indole ester protecting group, the resulting<br>
carboxyindole derivative is converted to compounds of formula 1 by coupling with the<br>
appropriate Z group. Condensation of the 6-indolecarboxylic acid with amines or<br>
alcohols can be accomplished using standard amide bond forming reagents such as<br>
TBTU, HATU, BOP, BroP, EDAC, DCC, isobutyl chloroformate and the like, or by<br>
activation of the carboxyl group by conversion to the corresponding acid chloride<br>
prior to condensation with an amine. Any remaining protecting group is removed<br>
following this step to give compounds of formula 1.1.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula 1.1 can be prepared by elaboration from a preexisting<br>
indole core by following adaptations of literature procedures as described,<br>
for example, by P. Gharagozloo et al. (Tetrahedron 1996, 52, 10185) or K. Freter (J.<br>
Org. Chem. 1975, 40, 2525). Such a methodology is illustrated in Scheme 2:<br>
(Figure Removed) In carrying out the route illustrated in Scheme 2, commercially available 6-<br>
indolecarboxylic acid 2(i), which can also be prepared according to the method of S.<br>
Kamiya et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1995, 43,1692) is used as the starting material.<br>
The indole 2(i) is reacted with a ketone 2(ii) under basic or acidic aldol-type<br>
conditions. Suitable conditions to affect this condensation include strong bases such<br>
as alkali metal hydroxides, alkoxides and hydrides in solvents such as lower alkyl<br>
alcohols (MeOH, EtOH, terfBuOH etc.), THF, dioxane, DMF, DMSO, DMA and the<br>
like at reaction temperature ranging from -20 °C to 120 °C. Alternatively, the<br>
condensation can be carried out under acid conditions using organic or mineral<br>
acids or both. Appropriate conditions include mixtures of AcOH and aqueous<br>
phosphoric acid at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 120 °C.<br>
The carboxylic acid group is then protected in the form of an ester (usually lower<br>
alkyl) using known methods. Halogenation (usually bromination, but also iodination)<br>
of the 2-position of the indole 2(iii) gives 2(iv). Suitable halogenating agents<br>
include, for example, elemental bromine, A/-bromosuccinimide, pyridine tribromide,<br>
dibromohydantoin and the corresponding iodo derivatives. Suitable solvents for this<br>
reaction are inert to reactive halogenating agents and include for example<br>
hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons (DCM, CCI4, CHCI3), ethers (THF, DME,<br>
dioxane), acetic acid, ethyl acetate, IPA, and mixtures of these solvents. Reaction<br>
temperature ranges from -40 °C to 100 °C. A method of choice to carry out the<br>
bromination of indoles as shown in Scheme 2 was described by L. Chu (Tet. Lett.<br>
1997,35,3871).<br>
The 2-bromoindole derivatives 2(iv) can be converted to fully substituted key<br>
intermediates l(v) by different sequences: (1) Trans-metallation of the 2-<br>
bromoindole to tin, boron, zinc species and the like, followed by cross-coupling<br>
reaction with aryl or heteroaryl halides under transition metal catalysis as described<br>
in scheme 1 gives indole derivative 2(vii) which can then be elaborated on nitrogen<br>
as described in scheme 1 to give key intermediate 1(v). In this approach, the indoleic<br>
NH is optionally protected with known protecting groups such as BOC, MOM, SEM,<br>
SO2Ph and the like. The protecting group is removed at a later stage of the<br>
sequence, prior to linker attachment. The conversion of 2-bromoindole derivatives<br>
2(iv) to the corresponding organotin species 2(vi) is carried out via initial lowtemperature<br>
(usually-78 ° to -30 °C) halogen-metal exchange using an alkyllithium<br>
reagent (e.g. nBuLi or fert-BuLi) or using lithium metal. The transient 2-lithioindole<br>
species is then trapped with a trialkyltin halide (e.g. nBu3SnCI or Me3SnCI) or a<br>
borate ester (e.g. trimethyl or triisopropyl borates). Alternatively, the lithioindole<br>
intermediate can be trapped with zinc chloride to form the corresponding<br>
organozincate which can also undergo transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling with<br>
aromatic and heteroaromatic halides or triflates as described, for example, by M.<br>
Rowley (J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1603). Alternatively, species such as 2(vi) where<br>
the indoleic NH is masked with a protecting group, can be generated directly from<br>
2(iii) by ester formation followed by indole NH protection and abstraction of the 2-H<br>
proton with strong base (e.g. alkyllithiums, alkalimetal amides) followed by transmetallation.<br>
Alternatively, 2-bromoindole 2(iv) can be cross-coupled directly to aryl<br>
and heteroaryl stannanes or boronic acid derivatives to give 2(vii) directly. Boron or<br>
tin organometallic species are from commercial sources or can be prepared by<br>
standard literature procedures. (2) In a second approach, 2-bromoindole 2(iv) is first<br>
elaborated on nitrogen to give 2(v) which is then cross-coupled to R2 to give the<br>
same intermediate 1(v) as described above.<br>
Cross-coupling with organoboron reagents can be carried out by any variations of<br>
the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction reported in the literature. This usually involves<br>
the use of a transition metal catalyst (usually Pd°), triaryl or triheteroarylphosphine<br>
ligands, an additive such as an inorganic chloride (e.g. LiCI), and a base (usually an<br>
aqueous inorganic base such as sodium or potassium carbonate or phosphate).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in an alcoholic solvent (EtOH), DME, toluene, THF<br>
and the like at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 140 °C.<br>
Cross-coupling with tin reagents can be carried out by any variations of the Stille<br>
cross-coupling reaction reported in the literature. This usually involves the use of a<br>
transition metal catalyst (usually Pd°), triaryl or triheteroaryl phosphine ligands, and<br>
an additive such as an inorganic chloride (e.g. LiCI) or iodide (e.g. Cul). Suitable<br>
solvents for this reaction include toluene, DMF, THF, DME and the like at<br>
temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 140 °C. Intermediate l(v) is then converted to<br>
compounds of formula 1.1 as described for Scheme 1.<br>
Reaction conditions to alkylate the nitrogen of an indole derivative are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art and include the use of strong bases such as alkali metal<br>
hydrides, hydroxides, carbonates, amides, alkoxides and alkylmetals, in the<br>
appropriate solvent (such as THF, dioxane, DME, DMF, MeCN, DMSO, alcohols and<br>
the like) at temperatures ranging from -78 °C to 140 °C. An electrophilic form of Sp<br>
is used for the alkylation of the indole anion. Such electrophilic species include<br>
iodides, bromides, chlorides and sulfonate esters (mesylate, tosylate, brosylate or<br>
triflate).<br>

(Figure Removed)Methyl 3-amino-4-iodobenzoate:<br>
3-Amino-4-iodobenzoic acid (13.35 g, 50.8 mmol) was added to MeOH (150mL) and<br>
SOCI2 (4.8 ml_, 65.8 mmol, 1.3 equivalent) was added. The mixture was refluxed for<br>
3 h and then volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was coevaporated<br>
3 x with MeOH and dried in vacuo (15.23 g).<br>
Methyl 3-trifluoroacetamido-4-iodobenzoate:<br>
The aniline derivative from above (14.53 g, 52 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (200<br>
ml) and TFAA (15 ml_, 104 mmol) was added. The dark purple solution was<br>
refluxed overnight. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the residue<br>
was passed through a short pad of silica gel using DCM as eluent. The desired<br>
product was obtained as a pink solid (13.81 g): MS (ES") m/z 371.9 (M-H).<br>
4-Phenylethynyl-3-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanoylamino)-benzoic acid methyl ester:<br>
The iodide from above (0.742 g, 2 mmol), phenylacetylene (0.37 ml, 3.9 mmol, 1.7<br>
equivalent) and Et3N (6 ml) were charged in a dry flask under argon. PdCI2(PPh3)2<br>
 (0.241 g, 0.3 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature until<br>
judged complete by HPLC analysis (~5 h). The reaction mixture was concentrated to<br>
1/2 volume under reduced pressure and diluted with water (80 mL). The mixture was<br>
extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL) and the organic extract washed with 5% HCI (100<br>
mL), after (100 mL) and brine (40 mL). After drying over MgSO4) the residue was<br>
purified by flash chromatography using 20% EtOAc - hexane as eluent to give the<br>
desired cross-coupled alkyne as a tan solid (0.442 g): MS (ES+) m/z348.0 (MH+).<br>

mmol) and the alkyne derivative from above (0.390 g, 1.1 mmol). Dry DMF (4 mL)<br>
was added and the suspension degassed with a stream of argon. The enol triflate<br>
derived from cyclohexanone, prepared following the procedure described by A.G.<br>
Martinez, M. Hanack et al. (J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1988, 25, 1237) or equivalent<br>

Methyl 3-cyclohexyl-2~phenylindole-6-carboxylate:<br>
The material from above was hydrogenated (1 atm H2 gas) over 20% Pd(OH)2 in the<br>
usual manner, using MeOH as solvent. The desired cyclohexane indole was<br>
isolated after filtration of the catalyst: MS (ES+) m/z 334.1 (MH+).<br>
3-Cyclohexyl-2-phenylindole-6-carboxylicacid:<br>
The methyl ester from above (0.154 g, 0.15 mmol) was refluxed overnight in a<br>

pressure, water (50 mL) was added and the product extracted with EtOAc. The<br>
extract was washed with water and brine, and dried (MgSO4). Removal of volatiles<br>
under reduced pressure gave the title indole carboxylic acid of example 1 as a lightorange<br>
solid (0.149 g): MS (ES~) m/z319 (M-H).<br>
Following the same procedure but using 2-ethynylpyridine instead of<br>
phenylacetylene, 3-cyclohexane-2-(2-pyridyl)indole-6-carboxylic acid was obtained.<br>

A mixture of 3-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde (1.24 g, 7.4 mmol) and (carbethoxymethylene)<br>
triphenylphophorane (2.6 g, 7.4 mmol) were dissolved in THF (60 ml)<br>
and stirred at 60 °C for 2 hours. The mixture was then concentrated and purified by<br>
flash column chromatography, using hexane in ethyl acetate (70 %) as the eluent, to<br>
obtain a the frans-cinnamate ester derivative as a pure yellow solid (1.73 g).<br>
The above cinnamate ester was dissolved in DMF (15 ml_), methyl iodide (1.35 ml_,<br>
21.7 mmol) and K2C03 (3.0 g, 21.7 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 20 hours. After that period, water was added and the precipitate<br>
formed was filtered and washed with water (2x). The solid was dissolved in ethyl<br>
acetate, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to dryness to give<br>
the crude methoxy analogue as a white solid (~1.7 g).<br>
The crude 3-methoxy-4-nitrocinnamate ester (570 mg, 2.27 mmol) and methylamine<br>
(30 mL of 2M in THF, 60 mmol) were heated in sealed tube at 85 °C for 40 hours.<br>
After that period the mixture was cooled to room temperature, concentrated and<br>
purified by flash column chromatography, using ethyl acetate in hexane (10 %) as<br>
the eluent, to obtain the desired 3-methylamino-4-nitrocinnamate ester (-160 mg).<br>

Intermediate 3-methylamino-4-nitrocinnamate ester (-150 mg) and SnCI2 dihydrate<br>
(950 mg, 4.2 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) and the mixture was stirred at<br>
80° C for 20 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated<br>
to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 ml_) and was slowly<br>
added to an aqueous solution of saturated NaHCO3 and stirred for 30 min. The<br>
organic layer was then extracted with ice cold brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4<br>
and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by<br>
flash column chromatography (using a gradient from 70 % to 60 % of hexane in ethyl<br>
acetate) to give the pure diamino cinnamate ester as a yellow solid (100 mg). ES+<br>

The above diamino intermediate (100 mg, 0.45 mmol) was suspended in CH2CI2 (5<br>
ml_) and the aminocyclobutyl acid chloride prepared from<br>
1-aminocyclobutanecarboxylic acid, following a similar procedure to that described in<br>
example 20 (77 mg, 0.45 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours and then concentrated to obtain a white solid. The<br>
solid was then dissolved in acetic acid (5 ml) and heated to 60 °C for 16 hours. The<br>
reaction mixture was cooled and the precipitate formed was filtered and washed with<br>
cold acetic acid, and then dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL) and washed with<br>
aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (2x) and ice cold brine. The organic layer was dried<br>
over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to<br>
give the title compound of example 15b (E)-3-[2-(1-amino-cyclobutyl)-3-methyl-3/-/-<br>
benzoimidazol-5-yl]-acrylic acid methyl ester as a white solid (58 mg).<br>
Note: it will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that the<br>
(carbethoxymethylene)triphenylphosphorane used in this procedure can be replaced<br>
by appropriately substituted derivatives to prepare analogues bearing various<br>
substituents on the cinnamate double bond. In addition, cinnamate methyl esters<br>
can also be prepared in an analogous fashion using the appropriate reagent.<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours, then diluted with<br>
ethyl acetate (100 mL) and extracted with aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (2x) and<br>
brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered, and the<br>
solvent was evaporated under vacuum to isolate the crude amide intermediate as a<br>
yellow oil (407 mg). The amide was dissolved in acetic acid (10 mL) and stirred at<br>
70 °C for 3 hours to induce dehydration and cyclization to the benzymidazole. The<br>
reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness, diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL)<br>
and washed with 10% aqueous citric acid (2x), aqueous saturated NaHCO3 and<br>
brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to<br>
dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography, using a solvent<br>
gradient of hexane in ethyl acetate (from 80 % to 50 %), to give the SEM-protected<br>
benzymidazole intermediate as a pink solid (574 mg). ES+ MS m/z: 390.2 (M+H)+<br>
The protecting group was then removed by dissolving this solid in TFA/CH2CI2 (2 mL,<br>

EXAMPLE 26<br>
4-(4-Ethoxycarbonyl-thiazol-2-yl)-phenyl-ammonium chloride:<br>
para-Bromoaniline (13.0 g, 76 mmol) and Boc2O (19.8 g, 91 mmol) were dissolved in<br>
toluene (380 ml) and stirred at 70 °C for 15 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to<br>
RT, evaporated to dryness, re-dissolved in EtOAc and washed with 0.1M HCI and<br>
brine. The organic solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, evaporated to<br>
dryness and purified by flash column chromatography, using 5% to 10% EtOAc in<br>
hexane as the eluent, to obtain the Boc-protected aniline (23 g). The Boc-protected<br>
bromoaniline (10.7 g, 39.2 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (75 ml) in a flask<br>
equipped with an overhead stirrer. The solution was cooled to 0 °C and MeLi (1.2 M<br>
in Et2O, 33 ml_, 39.2 mmol) was added drop wise while maintaining the internal<br>
temperature below 7 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 15 min and<br>
then cooled to -78 °C before n-BuLi (2.4 M in hexane, 17 ml_, 39.2 mmol) was<br>
added drop wise, maintaining the internal temperature below -70 °C). The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at -78 °C for 1 h, B(OEt)3 (17 ml, 98 mmol) was added drop wise<br>

ml, to pH ~1) for 15 min and NaCI(s) was added to saturate the aqueous layer. The<br>
aqueous layer was extracted with 0.5 M NaOH (4 x 100 ml_) and the combined<br>
aqueous layers were acidified with 5% HCI (150 ml, to pH ~1) and extracted with<br>
Et2O (3 x 200 ml_). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO4,<br>

solid obtained was triturated with acetone, filtered and recrystallized from EtOH to<br>
obtain the desired aminothiazole product (10.6 g, 40 mmol). The aminothiazole was<br>
then added slowly (over a period of 20 min) to a solution of t-butylnitrite (6.2 g, 60<br>
mmol) and CuBr2 (10.7 g, 48 mmol) in MeCN (160 mL) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture<br>
was allowed to warm-up to RT and to stirred for 2.5 h. The mixture was then added<br>
to an aqueous HCI solution (20%) and extracted with Et2O (2 x 400 ml). The<br>
organic layer was washed with aqueous HCI (10%), dried over anhydrous MgS04<br>
and evaporated to dryness. The desired bromothiazole product was isolated in<br>

added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C under argon for 20 h. The<br>
reaction mixture was then cooled to RT, diluted with EtOAc and extracted with brine,<br>
aqueous NaHCO3 (2 x) and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous<br>
MgS04 and concentrated to dryness. The carbamate-ester product was isolated<br>
after flash column chromatography using 20% to 30% EtOAc in hexane: 180 mg.<br>

in anhydrous DMF (6 ml) and NaH (0.078 g, 60%, 1.92 mmol) was added. The<br>
reaction was stirred at RT for 20 min, then Mel (160//L, 2.56 mmol) was added and<br>
stirring was continued for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with the addition of<br>
aqueous NaHCO3 (-1%) while stirring vigorously. The brown solid formed (0.096 g)<br>
was filtered and dried in air overnight.<br>
The N-methyl nitro derivative (196 mg, 0.79 mmol) was then dissolved in DMF (4<br>
ml_), H2O (400 /jl) and SnCI22H2O (888 mg, 3.95 mmol) were added, and the<br>
mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 3 h. The mixture was then partitioned between 10%<br>
aqueous NaHCO3 and EtOAc and stirred vigorously. The aqueous layer was reextracted<br>
with EtOAc and the combined EtOAc layers were washed with brine, dried<br>
over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by<br>
flash column chromatography, using 1:1 ration EtOAc/hexane as the eluent, to<br>
obtain the pure 5-aminoindole derivative (118 mg) of example 27.<br>

AcOH (133 mg), acetaldehyde (33 mg, 0.74 mmol) and NaCNBH3 (23mg, 0.37<br>
mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h.<br>
The reaction mixture was concentrated to remove most of the solvent, the residue<br>
was re-dissolved in EtOAc and washed with saturated NaHCO3 and brine. The<br>
organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to give the N-ethyl<br>
derivative as an orange solid.<br>
This solid was dissolved in THF (2.5 ml), DBU (113 mg, 0.74 mmol) was added and<br>
the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The solvent was<br>
evaporated, the remaining residue was dissolved in EtOAc and the organic layer was<br>
washed with saturated NaHCO3 and brine. The organic layer was further extracted<br>
with 1N HCI and H2O (2 x), and the pH of the combined aqueous layers was<br>
adjusted to pH -10 with 1N NaOH. The aqueous layer was then extracted with<br>
EtOAc (3 x), the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over<br>
anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness to give the title amine derivative of<br>
example 28 (44 mg): MS (ES+) m/z 373.1 (MH+).<br>
A similar reductive amination procedure was used to prepare other N-alkylated<br>
pyrrolidine (e.g. cucurbitine) and piperidine derivatives. Alternatively, the reductive<br>
amination can be performed as the last step on a fully assembled inhibitor.<br>
EXAMPLE 29<br>
General procedure for coupling amines to 6-indole carboxylic acids to give<br>
amide derivatives of general formulae I:<br>
Indole carboxylic acids were coupled to various amines (for example according to<br>
the examples 15a, 15b, 15c, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 34, 35, 36, 42, 43, or 45)<br>
using standard amide bond forming procedures familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
Amide bond forming reagents include but are not limited to carbodiimides (DCC,<br>
EDC), TBTU, HBTU, HATU and BOP-CI in the presence or absence of additives<br>
such as HOBt or HOAT. Indole carboxylic acids can also be activated for coupling<br>
by conversion to the corresponding acid chloride, symmetrical anhydride or<br>
unsymmetrical anhydrides using standard protocols familiar to those skilled in the art<br>
of organic chemistry. The coupling of indole carboxylic acids with amines is<br>
generally carried out in solvents such as THF, DCM, DMF, DMSO or MeCN, in the<br>
presence of a tertiary organic base including, but not limited to triethylamine, Nmethylmorpholine,<br>
collidine and diisopropylethylamine. Following coupling of the<br>
indole carboxylic acid with the amine, any remaining protecting group that remains in<br>
the molecule can then be removed using the appropriate procedure. The following<br>
example serves to illustrate such a process and is non-limiting.<br>

carboxylic acid was activated using amide bond forming agents such as<br>
carbodiimides (DCC, EDC), TBTU, HATU and the like and treated with sulfonamides<br>
in the presence of DMAP. Sulfonamides were either from commercial sources or<br>
prepared from the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides and a solution of ammonia in<br>
dioxane.<br>

crotyl bromide (85%, 16.47 mL, 160 mmol) was added dropwise over 4 min. The<br>
resulting amber suspension was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. It was then<br>
poured into DCM and the solution washed with water and brine. The extract was<br>
dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to a pale yellow oil consisting of a mixture of two<br>
isomeric allyl ether (4:1 ratio). Upon standing at room temperature, the oil partially<br>
crystallized. The supernatant was decanted and the crystals washed with hexane to<br>
provide 12.5 g of the desired ether as white crystals.<br>
The above material (10.30 g, SOmmol) was added to a flask heated to 230 °C in a<br>
sand bath and the melted oil was stirred for 25 min at that temperature. The material<br>

combined organic phases were then dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to yield the<br>
aldehyde as a pale yellow solid (960 mg; 99 %) which was used as such.<br>
Sodium hydride (95% dry powder; 158 mg; 6.25 mmol) was suspended in anhydrous<br>
THF (10 mL) and trimethyl phosphonoacetate (0.945 mL; 5.84 mmol) added<br>
dropwise at 0°C under a nitrogen atmosphere resulting in a solid white mass which<br>
could not be stirred. A solution of the aldehyde from above (950 mg; 4.87 mmol) in<br>
THF (7 mL + 3 mL rinse) was then added dropwise resulting in a yellow colour and<br>
slow dissolution of the white solid mass. After the addition, the reaction was allowed<br>
to warm to ambient temperature. After 15 h, the cloudy reaction mixture was<br>
evaporated to a pale yellow solid which was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL)<br>
and washed with saturated NaHCO3 (3 x 75 mL). The combined extracts were dried<br>
over MgSO4 and evaporated to afford the cinnamate ester as pale yellow solid<br>
(1.212 g; 99 %) which was used without further purification.<br>
The nitro cinnamate from above (0,300 g, 1.2 mmol) was suspended in EtOH (12<br>
mL) and water (7.5 mL) and K2CO3 (0.990 g, 7.16 mmol) and 85% sodium<br>
hydrosulfite (1.247 g. 7.16 mmol) were added successively. The mixture was stirred<br>
vigorously at room temperature for 1.5 h. It was then diluted with water (10 mL) and<br>
the ethanol removed under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture was extracted<br>
with EtOAc (2 x), washed with water and brine and dried (MgSO4). Removal of the<br>
solvent under reduced pressure gave the desired aniline as a yellow solid.<br>
Note: the analogous methoxy derivative was prepared in the same manner using<br>
commercially available 2-methoxy-4-nitrobenzoic acid as starting material.<br>
EXAMPLE 37<br>
3-(4,5-Diamino-2-alkoxy-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl esters<br>
-149-<br>
The procedures will be illustrated for R = Et but similar protocols can be used to<br>
prepare derivatives with other alkoxy substituents.<br>
The ortho-ethoxy-para-nitro cinnamate derivative prepared as described in example<br>
36 (600 mg; 2.39 mmol) was dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid (5.5 ml) at<br>
0°C and potassium nitrate (253 mg; 2.50 mmol) added in portions over 3 min. After<br>
5 min, the resulting yellow-brown solution was allowed to warm to ambient<br>
temperature and was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 3 h, the reaction<br>
was added to ice (75 g) resulting in a pale yellow precipitate. Once the ice had<br>
melted, the suspension was sonicated, filtered and washed several times with<br>
distilled water. Air drying overnight afforded the dinitrocinnamate as a pale yellow,<br>
chalky solid (661 mg; 93 %) which was used without further purification.<br>
The dinitrocinnamate (657 mg; 2.22 mmol) was dissolved/suspended in ethanol /<br>
water (1:1; 40 mL) resulting in a yellow suspension which was stirred vigorously at<br>
ambient temperature. Potassium carbonate (3.06 g; 22.2 mmol) and sodium<br>
hydrosulfite (3.86 g; 22.2 mmol) were successively added resulting immediately in a<br>
dark violet/green colour which quickly began to lighten to a pale orange. After 3 h,<br>
the reaction was diluted with water (20 mL) and the ethanol evaporated. The<br>
aqueous residue was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL) and washed with<br>
saturated NaHCO3 (2 x 60 mL) and brine (30 mL). The combined extracts were<br>
dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to afford the dianiline as a dark orange syrup<br>
which solidified under high vacuum (377 mg; 72 %).<br>
Such dianiline derivatives as described in this example could be converted to<br>
benzimidazole derivatives by coupling to amino acid derivatives as described in<br>
example 22 to prepare inhibitors.<br>
EXAMPLE 38<br>
3-(4-Amino-2-alkyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl esters and 3-(4,5-diamino-2-<br>
alkyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl esters<br>
As one skilled in the art would recognize, analogs of derivatives presented in<br>
examples 36 and 37 where the alkoxy group has been replaced by an alkyl, alkenyl<br>
or alkynyl substitutent (e.g. R = Me, Et, Pr, vinyl, allyl) can be prepared by converting<br>
such an alkoxy derivative (e.g. methoxy) to the corresponding phenol by cleaving the<br>
ether linkage with reagents such as BBr3 and then converting the phenol substituent<br>
to the corresponding triflate. Such Inflates can then be used as substrates in a<br>
variety of transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with organometallic<br>
reagents that would allow replacement of the triflate functionality by an alkyl<br>
substituent. Such reagents might include tetraalkyltin, tetraalkenyltin, alkylboronic<br>
acid and alkenylboronic acid derivatives that would undergo cross-coupling under<br>
Pd° catalysis. In some cases (e.g. allyl or vinyl), the substituent can be further<br>
elaborated (e.g. the double bond can be converted to a cyclopropane ring using a<br>
cyclopropanating reagent known to people skilled in the art)<br>
Once the alkyl group has been introduced, the intermediates can then be elaborated<br>
to inhibitors following synthetic sequences described in previous examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 39<br>
1-Carboxymethyl-3-cyclohexyl-2-furan-3-yl-7-methyl-1H-indole-6-carboxylic<br>
acid methyl ester<br>
Step 1: 3-amino-4-methylbenzoic acid (15.00 g, 0.099 mol) was suspended in<br>
MeOH (150 mL) and thionyl chloride (25.33 ml_, 0.347 mol, 3.5 equiv.) was added<br>
dropwise. The mixture was heated overnight at 70 °C. After cooling to RT, volatiles<br>
were removed under reduced pressure and the residue triturated with ether (150<br>
ml). The solid was filtered off and dried (18.36 g). The solid was suspended in<br>
DCM (600 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (250 mL) was added. After stirring<br>
for 15 minutes, the organic layer was separated and washed successively with<br>
NaHCO3 solution (2 x 250 mL), water (250 mL) and brine (250 mL). The solution<br>
was dried (Na2SO4), filtered and evaporated to dryness to give the desired aniline<br>
(14.8 g, 90% yield).<br>
Steps 2 and 3: the ester from above (12.50 g, 75.6 mmol) was dissolved in DCM<br>
(190 mL) and methylthioaldehyde dimethyl acetal (10.1 mL, 75.6 mmol) was added.<br>
The solution was cooled to -30 °C. N-chlorosuccinimide (10.10 g, 75.6 mmol) was<br>
added in 6 portions over 30 minutes. Triethylamine (10.6 mL, 75.6 mmol) was then<br>
added dropwise over 10 min and after stirring for an additional 15 min, the cooling<br>
bath was removed and the temperature brought to reflux. After 5 h, the reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to RT and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in<br>
ether (750 mL) and 2M HCI (303 mL) was added. After stirring at RT for 1.5 h, the<br>
ether layer was separated and washed with NaHCO3 solution (2 x 150 mL) and brine<br>
(250 mL). The original acidic aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (2 x 100 mL)<br>
and the extracts washed as above and then combined with the first ether phase.<br>
The combined organic phases were dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated to dryness and<br>
the material purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using 30-0% hexane in<br>
DCM as eluent to give the desired 3-thiomethylindole derivative (9.37 g).<br>
Step 4: the thiomethyl indole from above (8.37 g, 35.4 mmol) was dissolved in<br>
absolute EtOH (220 mL) and Raney-nickel (Ra-Ni) (25 g) was added. After stirring<br>
at RT for 3 h, another portion of Ra-Ni (15 g) was added and stirring resumed for an<br>
additional 45 min. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to<br>
give the desired indole (6.26 g, 93%).<br>
Steps 5: the indole ester from above (4.00 g, 21 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of<br>
MeOH (18 mL) and water (18 mL). KOH (11.86 g, 210 mmol) was added and the<br>
mixture stirred at 75 °C for 2 h. Cyclohexanone (7.26 g, 74 mmol, 3 equiv.) was<br>
added dropwise over 15 min and stirring at 75 °C was continued overnight. MeOH<br>
was removed under reduced pressure and water (500 mL) was added to the residue.<br>
Insoluble material was removed by filtration and the aqueous phase was then<br>
washed with TBME (200 mL). The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 4 with formic<br>
acid to produce a white precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed with water<br>
and dried. The desired cyclohexenylindole was obtained (4.77 g, 89%).<br>
Steps 6-8: as described in example 2.<br>
Steps 9-11: as described in examples 4 and 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 40<br>
1-Carboxymethyl-3-cyclohexyl-2-furan-3-yl-5-methoxy-1H-indole-6-carboxylic<br>
acid methyl ester<br>
Step 1: 4-methylsalicylic acid (100 g, 0.66 mol) was dissolved in acetone (1 L) and<br>
K2CO3 (227 g, 1.64 mol, 2.5 equiv.) was added in portions. The mixture was heated<br>
to reflux and dimethylsulfate (155 mL, 1.64 mol, 2.5 equiv.) was added dropwise<br>
over 1 h. The mixture was refluxed overnight. Additional K2CO3 (90 g) and<br>
dimethylsulfate (60 mL) were added and the mixture refluxed for an additional 20 h.<br>
K2CO3 (20 g) and dimethylsulfate (15 mL) were again added and after refluxing for 7<br>
h, the reaction was judged complete by TLC. Solids were removed by filtration using<br>
acetone for washings and the filtrate concentrated to a volume of 200 mL. The<br>
solution was diluted with MeOH (1 L) and stirred with ammonium hydroxide (300 mL)<br>
for 30 min. MeOH was removed under reduced pressure and the residue extracted<br>
with EtOAc (2 x 400 mL). The extract was washed with brine (500 mL) and dried<br>
(Na2SO4). Removal of volatiles gave the desired product as a yellow oil (119 g).<br>
Step 2: the ester from above (117 g, 0.649 mol) was charged in a flask cooled in<br>
ice. The ester was dissolved in cone. H2SO4 (600 mL) and the solution cooled to -3<br>
°C. Cone. HNO3 (51 mL) was added dropwise over 1.5 h keeping the internal<br>
temperature around 0 °C. The ice bath was removed and the mixture stirred at RT<br>
for 3.5 h. The reaction mixture was poured over ice and allowed to stand overnight.<br>
The precipitated solid was collected by filtration, washed with water and dried. The<br>
material was purified by trituration from hot methanol and flash chromatography on<br>
silica gel to separate the desired product from a dinitro side product.<br>
Step 3: The nitro ester from above (75.7 g, 0.336 mol) was dissolved in DMF (322<br>
mL) and DMF dimethylacetal (120.1 g, 1.01 mol) was added dropwise over 10 min.<br>
The mixture was heated to 115 °C for 3h (complete by TLC). The reaction mixture<br>
was cooled to RT and volatiles removed under vacuum. The residue was coevaporated<br>
twice with DCM and triturated with ether to give a total of 90.02 g (95%<br>
yield) of the desired enamine derivative.<br>
Step 4: The enamine from step 3 (90.02 g, 0.321 mol) was dissolved in 1:1 THFMeOH<br>
(1.48 L) and the mixture heated to 35 °C in a water bath. Raney nickel<br>
(washed with THF, 6.3 g) was added followed by dropwise addition of hydrazine<br>
(18.5 g, 0.369 mol) over 15 min. After stirring for 1h (internal temperature: 49 °C), a<br>
second portion of hydrazine (18.5 g) was added dropwise and the mixture stirred<br>
overnight at 49 °C. Evaporated solvent was replenished and Raney-nickel (6.3 g)<br>
and hydrazine (18.5 g) were again added followed by another portion of hydrazine<br>
(18.5 g) after stirring for an additional 3 h. After stirring at 54 °C overnight, the<br>
reaction was completed by addition of a last portion of Raney-nickel (6.3 g) and<br>
hydrazine (36 mL) and stirring 20 h. The reaction mixture was then brought back to<br>
RT and filtered using DCM for washings. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness<br>
under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash chromatography on silica<br>
gel using 2-30% EtOAc in DCM as eluent. The desired indole was obtained (41.1 g).<br>
The indole from step 4 was elaborated to the title compound of example 40 using<br>
procedures similar to those described in the previous example.<br>
EXAMPLE 41<br>
3-Cyclohexyl-2-furan-3-yl-5-hydroxy-1-[2-oxo-2-(4-pyrrolidin-1-yl-piperidin-1-<br>
yl)-ethyl]-1 H-indole-6-carboxylic acid<br>
(Figure Removed)This is a representative procedure that can be applied to analogs with other amide<br>
substituents: the methoxyindole (30 mg) was dissolved in DCM (1 ml_) and the<br>
solution was cooled in ice under a nitrogen atmosphere. Boron tribromide (1M in<br>
DCM, 0.3 ml) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred for 40 min at 0 °C<br>
and then 30 min at RT. The reaction was then quenched by addition of ice, diluted<br>
with DCM and neutralized by addition of solid NaHCO3. The organic phase was<br>
separated and dried (MgSO4). Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure<br>
gave the desired phenol derivative as a yellow solid (21 mg) that was saponified to<br>
give the title compound of example 41 under standard conditions. Alternatively, the<br>
intermediate phenolic ester can be alkylated under standard conditions (e.g. NaH in<br>
DMF) to produce various ether derivatives (e.g. with tert-butyl bromoacetate)<br>
EXAMPLE 42<br>
1-(2-Methyl-thiazol-4-yl)-cyclobutylaminehydrochloride<br>
Step 1: The starting protected amino acid was obtained using a similar procedure to<br>
that described in example 21 but using benzyl alcohol instead of trimethylsilyl ethanol<br>
in the curtius rearrangement. The acid (7.48 g, 30mmol) was dissolved in THF (50<br>
ml_) and the solution cooled to -8 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. NMethylmorpholine<br>
(3.63 ml_, 33 mmol) was added dropwise followed by<br>
isobutylchloroformate (3.89 ml, 30 mmol). The suspension was stirred for 10 min<br>
and filtered under nitrogen, keeping the filtrate at -8 °C. The solution was then<br>
added to an excess ethereal diazomethane solution and the mixture stirred for 30<br>
min (TLC shows complete conversion to the diazomethylketone). 48% HBr in water<br>
(3.50 mL, 31 mmol) was then added dropwise over 5 min to the cold solution. A<br>
second portion of HBr (3.5 mL) was added after 5 min, the cooling bath was<br>
removed and the mixture stirred at RT overnight. Ether (250 mL) was added and the<br>
solution washed with water (2 x 50 mL), saturated NaHCO3 (50 mL) and brine (50<br>
mL). After drying (MgS04), volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the<br>
residue triturated with 1:4 ether/ hexanes. The white solid was filtered, washed with<br>
hexane and dried in vacuum. The desired bromomethylketone (7.35 g, 75% yield)<br>
was obtained as a white solid.<br>
Step 2: The bromomethylketone from above (228 mg, 0.7 mmol) and thioacetamide<br>
(56.3 mg, 0.75 mmol) were heated to reflux in isopropanol (5 mL). After 1 h, the<br>
reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and the oily residue triturated with water<br>
to give a white precipitate that was collected, washed with water and dried in vacuum<br>
(185 mg, 87% yield).<br>
Step 3: 10% Pd on charcoal (70 mg) was suspended in EtOH (5 mL) and the<br>
protected thiazole derivative from above (180 mg) was added. Hydrochloric acid<br>
was added to acidify the reaction mixture which was then stirred under 1 atm of H2<br>
gas for 20 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated to<br>
dryness under reduced pressure to give the desired amine hydrochloride as a white<br>
solid (104 mg) after trituration with ether.<br>
The amine hydrochloride was coupled to indole derivatives under standard<br>
conditions.<br>
Note: Analogous thiazole derivatives can be prepared in a similar way by using<br>
differently substituted thioamide, thiourea or acylthiourea derivatives. In addition,<br>
other protected amino acids can be used as starting materials in this sequence and<br>
converted to their respective bromo or chloromethylketones to be used in turn to<br>
prepare various substituted thiazole derivatives.<br>
EXAMPLE 43<br>
(Z)-3-[2-(1-Amino-cyclobutyl)-6-ethoxy-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]-acrylic<br>
acid methyl ester<br>
The 4-nitro-2-ethoxycinnamate (303 mg, 1.206 mmol), prepared as described in<br>
example 36 was dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid ( 3 ml_) and the solution<br>
cooled to 0 °C. Potassium nitrate (128 mg, 1.27 mmol) was added and the mixture<br>
stirred for 3.5 h at room temperature. After completion, the reaction mixture was<br>
poured over ice and the precipitated solid was collected by filtration. The crude<br>
product was washed with water, dried under vacuum and used without purification in<br>
the next step (390 mg).<br>
The dinitro derivative from above (390 mg) was dissolved in THF (3 ml_) and<br>
methylamine in THF (3.02 ml_ of a 2M solution in THF) was added. After stirring for<br>
30 min, volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the orange solid used<br>
as such in the next step.<br>
The nitro arene from above was suspended in a mixture of EtOH (12 ml) and water<br>
(12 ml_) and K2CO3 (1.00 g, 6 equivalents ) was added followed by sodium<br>
hydrosulfite (1.26 g, 6 equivalents). The mixture was stirred for 4 h at room<br>
temperature and EtOH was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
extracted with EtOAc and the organic phase washed with brine and dried (MgSO4).<br>
Removal of the solvent and purification of the residue by flash chromatography (50<br>
to 75% EtOAc in hexane) gave the desired diamine (162 mg).<br>
The dianiline from above (162 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (6 mL) and<br>
aminocyclobutanecarboxyl chloride hydrochloride prepared as in example 20 (116<br>
mg) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, diluted with<br>
EtOAc and the solution washed with aqueous NaHCO3 and brine. After drying<br>
(MgSO4), volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
dissolved in AcOH (3 ml) and the solution heated to 80 °C for 1 h. After cooling to<br>
room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into water and basified to pH 9<br>
by addition of solid K2CO3. The organic phase was then extracted with EtOAc,<br>
washed with brine and dried (MgSO4). Removal of the solvent gave a residue that<br>
was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using 0 to 5% MeOH in EtOAc to<br>
give the title compound of example 43 (68 mg).<br>
EXAMPLE 44<br>
7-Methoxy-1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid methyl ester:<br>
Step 1: 4-methylsalicylic acid (32.1 g, 0.21 mol) and potassium carbonate (61.2 g,<br>
0.44 mol) were suspended in acetone (300 mL) and the mixture brought to reflux<br>
temperature. Dimethyl sulfate (66.5 g, 0.53 mol) was added dropwise within 1 h and<br>
stirring continued overnight at reflux. Additional dimethylsulfate (30 mL) and<br>
potassium carbonate (2 X 15 g) were added and refluxing for an additional 24 h was<br>
required to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room<br>
temperature and inorganic salts removed by filtration using acetone for washings.<br>
The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and the oily residue was<br>
dissolved in MeOH (300 mL). Concentrated ammonium hydroxide (90 mL) was<br>
added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Methanol<br>
was removed in vacuo and the residue portioned between ether (300 mL) and water<br>
(200 mL). The organic phase was separated and washed with brine and dried<br>
(Na2SO4). Evaporation of the ether gave the desired di-methylated product as a<br>
yellow oil (38.1 g) that was used directly in the next step.<br>
Step 2: The ester from above (38.0 g, 0.21 mol) was dissolved in AcOH (250 ml_)<br>
and bromine (37.2 g, 0.23 mol, 1.1 equiv.) was added dropwise over 30 min with<br>
stirring at room temperature. After completion, the reaction mixture was stirred for<br>
an additional hour, at which point TLC analysis indicated complete conversion. The<br>
reaction mixture was poured into water (1 L) and solid Na2CO3 was added cautiously<br>
with stirring until the mixture was neutral. The off-white precipitate that formed was<br>
collected by filtration, washed with water and dried to give the desired bromo<br>
derivative (47.2 g).<br>
Step 3: The bromo derivative from above (44.5 g, 0.17 mol) was added in small<br>
portions to cone. H2SO4 (170 ml) and the mixture was stirred in an ice-salt bath until<br>
all solids dissolved. Cone. HN03 (17 ml_) was then added dropwise over 20 min and<br>
stirring continued for an additional hour in the ice bath. The reaction mixture was<br>
then slowly added to ice-water (2 L) and the precipitated yellow solid was collected<br>
by filtration. The solid was washed with water, NaHCO3 solution and water again.<br>
After drying, the desired nitro derivative was obtained as an orange solid (36.8 g).<br>
Step 4: The product from above (129.0 g, 0.42 mol) was dissolved in DMF (400 ml)<br>
and DMF-dimethyl acetal (151.6 g, 1.27 mol, 3 equiv.) was added in one portion.<br>
The mixture was heated at 110-120 °C under an argon atmosphere until conversion<br>
was judged complete by TLC (24 h). The reaction mixture was cooled to room<br>
temperature and volatiles removed under vacuum to give a dark colored residue<br>
(-180 g). Trituration from ether-THF gave the desired enamine as red crystals (72<br>
Step 5: The enamine from above (72.0 g, 0.20 mol) was dissolved in a mixture of<br>
THF (600 ml) and MeOH (600 ml_). The dark red solution was heated to 30 °C and<br>
Raney-Nickel (18 g) was added to the solution. Hydrazine hydrate (11.6 g, 0.23 mol,<br>
1.15 equiv.) was then added dropwise over 30 min. The reaction temperature was<br>
increased to 50 °C and a second portion of hydrazine hydrate (11.6 g, 0.23 mol, 1.15<br>
equiv.) was added over 30 min. After stirring overnight at 50 °C, additional Raneynickel<br>
(20 g) and hydrazine hydrate (11.6 g, 0.23 mol, 1.15 equiv.) were added and<br>
after stirring for another 7 h at 50 °C, the reaction was judged complete by TLC.<br>
After cooling, the catalyst was removed by filtration through a pad of celite and the<br>
filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The dark brown residue was<br>
dissolved in EtOAc (3 L) and the solution washed with water (1.5 L), 10% HCI (1 L)<br>
and brine (700 mL). After drying (Na2SO4), removal of solvents gave the desired<br>
bromoindole derivative as a brown solid (35 g).<br>
Step 6: The bromoindole derivative from above (35 g) was dissolved in MeOH (1 L)<br>
and triethylamine (16.3 g, 1.2 equiv.) was added followed by 10% Pd/C (1.06 g).<br>
The mixture was stirred under hydrogen (35 psi) until completion of the reaction (7<br>
h). The catalyst was then removed by filtration and volatiles removed under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc (700 mL) and the solution washed<br>
with 10% HCI (SOOmL), water (350 mL), NaHCO3 (350 mL) and brine. The solution<br>
was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the desired<br>
indole as a light brown solid (25 g).<br>
This indole derivatives was saponified under standard conditions and elaborated to<br>
final inhibitors as previously described for analogous derivatives.<br>
EXAMPLE 45<br>
2-(1~AminO"Cyclobutyl)-6~methoxy-3-methyl-3H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic<br>
acid methyl ester<br>
Methyl 2-methoxy-5-nitrobenzoate (6.21 g, 29.4 mmol) was suspended in MeOH<br>
(100 mL) and 20% Pd(OH)2/C (500 mg) was added. The mixture was stirred under a<br>
hydrogen atmosphere (1 atm) for 18 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration and<br>
the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure (5.256 g).<br>
The aniline from above (5.23 g) was dissolved in THF (50 mL) and acetic anhydride (<br>
2.984 g) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The<br>
white suspension was concentrated under reduced pressure to a white paste, tertbutylmethyl<br>
ether (TBME, 20 mL) was added and while stirring, hexane (100 mL)<br>
was added slowly. The suspension was then stirred for an additional 2h and the<br>
solid collected by filtration. The product was washed with hexane and dried in air<br>
(6.372 g).<br>
90% Nitric acid (9 ml) was diluted with water (9 ml_) and cooled to 0 °C. The anilide<br>
from above (5.905 g) was added in one portion and the mixture stirred for 30 min in<br>
the ice-water bath. The reaction mixture was then added dropwise to ice-water (700<br>
ml) and the precipitated yellow solid was collected by filtration, washed with water<br>
and dried in air. The orange solid (5.907 g) was shown by 1H NMR to consist of a<br>
2:1 mixture of compounds. Extraction of the aqueous filtrate from above with EtOAc<br>
gave an additional 1 g of material that was combined with the first crop and purified<br>
by flash chromatography on silica gel using 015% EtOAc in CHCI3 as eluent. An<br>
orange solid (4.11 g) was obtained (one isomer).<br>
The nitroanilide from above (3.580 g) was dissolved in THF (50 ml) and the solution<br>
cooled in ice. lodomethane (4.155 mL, 66.7 mmol, 5 equivalents) and sodium tertbutoxide<br>
(6.414 g, 66.7 mmol, 5 equivalents) were added in two portions at a 3.5 h<br>
interval. Stirring at room temperature was continued for an additional 20 h after the<br>
second addition. THF was evaporated under reduced pressure and water (100 mL)<br>
was added. The deep red solution was washed with TBME (100 mL). The aqueous<br>
phase was acidified with cone. HCI and extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL). The<br>
combined organic extracts were dried and concentrated to a dark red powder (3.78<br>
g) that was used directly in the next step.<br>
The free carboxylic acid (3.75 g) was suspended in 8M HCI (100 mL) and the<br>
mixture stirred at 100 °C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, volatiles were<br>
evaporated under vacuum and the residue was co-evaporated 3 times with MeOH.<br>
The residue was suspended again in MeoH (100 mL) and cooled in ice-water.<br>
Thionyl chloride (5.10 mL, 5 equivalents) was added dropwise and the suspension<br>
stirred at 65 °C for 4 h. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the<br>
residue co-evaporated twice with MeOH (100 mL) and then toluene (2 x 100 mL).<br>
The residue was then dissolved in MeOH (200 mL), 20% Pd(OH)2 / C (500 mg) was<br>
added and the mixture stirred overnight under 1 atm of hydrogen gas. The catalyst<br>
was then removed by filtration and the solution evaporated to dryness. The residue<br>
was dissolved in EtOAc and the solution washed with aqueous NaHCO3 and dried<br>
(MgSO4). Removal of solvents gave a solid that was suspended in TBME (50 mL)<br>
and heated to 60 °C for 30 min. An equal volume of hexane was then slowly added<br>
to the hot solution and the precipitated material was collected by filtration, washed<br>
with TBME-hexane and dried (2.00 g).<br>
The diamine from above (1.950 g) was dissolved in DCM (50 mL) and the solution<br>
cooled in ice. 1-Aminocyclobutyryl chloride hydrochloride prepared using a similar<br>
procedure as in example 20 (1.50 g) was added in 3 portions over a 1.5 h period.<br>
The mixture was then warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. Additional<br>
acid chloride (0.50 g) was added and stirring continued for another 2 h. DCM was<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure and AcOH (30 ml) was added and the mixture<br>
heated to 80 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and<br>
volatiles evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in water<br>
(100 ml) and solid NaHCO3 was added in portions until a pH of 8 was reached. The<br>
product was then extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 ml), dried (Na2SO4) and<br>
concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica<br>
gel using 0 to 15% EtOH in EtOAc as eluent. The title compound of example 45 was<br>
obtained as a grey powder (1.05 g).<br>
