				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with modified viscosity for dry resist application. More particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity for aqueous developable formulations. The polymer composition that were used for the process of this invention was copolymers with multifunctional groups developed in the copending application No.813/DEL/2000 of the applicants in which it has been described and claimed a process for the preparation of copolymers with multifunctional groups comprising mixing in a yellow light atmosphere a photo-curable polymer solution with an organic dye, a sensitizer, a crosslinking monomer and solvent<br>
The photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity thus prepared by the process of this invention are useful for transfer of image onto a printed circuit board or lithographic plate as dry resists.<br>
Dry resists are important imaging generation which are extensively used in the manufacture of wire boards and printed circuit boards. The dry resist essentially consists of a photocurable composition sandwiched between a polyester base sheet and a polyethylene cover foil. In applications, the cover foil is removed and the base sheet is laminated onto a copper clad insulating support The copper clad insulating support is then selectively exposed to UV source through a photomask. The photomask comprises of parts that are opaque and other transparent to UV source. The differential parts of the photomask thus transfer an image to the copper clad insulating support<br>
The photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity prepared as per the process of this invention, fall into the category of negative photoresists. In this category of photoresists, the areas exposed to UV source, become insoluble in a developing solution as a result of the photochemical reaction occurring during exposure to UV source. The unexposed areas are soluble in the<br><br>
developing solution and can be removed whereby an image is transferred to the copper clad insulating support.<br>
In the formulation of photo-curable composition, the essential ingredients are the polymer solution which normally consists of a tri, tetra polymer with composition of choice, a dye, a sensitizer, crosslinking monomer, photo-initiator, solvent. For hand lay up applications, the viscosity of the solution is not very critical. However, if the composition has to be used on a mechanical coating unit, the viscosity of the formulation becomes critical. If the right viscosity is not maintained the coating thickness would vary and the non-uniformity would pose problems in processing.<br>
The viscosity of the polymer solution as obtained from the reactor is not sufficient for mechanical coating applications and there is a need to improve the viscosity by suitable additives so that the viscosity can be adjusted to suit the mechanical device of choice.<br>
The known compositions available suffers from the disadvantage that the viscosity of the solution cannot be changed to suit the mechanical device of choice for getting a uniform film. Changes in the viscosity of the photo-curable composition should be made in such a way the resulting polymer can be readily used for photoresist formulations. The primary requirements for such applications are -<br>
1. The polymer should contain carboxylic acid groups such that the polymer after exposure to UV source should be aqueous soluble.<br><br>
2.	The polymer should have sufficient mechanical strength so that<br>
during the processing stage, the film remains in tact.<br>
3.	The polymer should contain aromatic groups so that quantum<br>
efficiency during the photochemical reaction step is possible.<br>
4.	The glass temperature of the polymer should be close to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
These characteristics should not be disturbed while improving the viscosity.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity so that die glass transition temperature and mechanical strength are not altered.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity that does not disturb the photochemical reaction to give image of choice after developing.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of photo-curable composition of modified changeable viscosity for dry resist application comprising mixing in an inert atmosphere a photocurable polymer solution as claimed in the copending application 813/DEL/2000 with an aliphatic amine such as hexyl amine, octyl amine, dodecyl amine at concentration of 1 to 10% for a period ranging from 10 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 25° to 30°C and collecting the resultant product in the form of solution.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention, the inert gas used may be nitrogen, argon.<br>
In another embodiment the aliphatic amine used may be haxylamine, octyl amine, dodacyl amine and the concentration used may be 0.1 to 0.05%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the photo-curable formulation used may be prepared by mixing in an yellow light atmosphere, a photo-curable polymer solution with an organic dye, a sensitizer, photo-initiator, crosslinking monomar, solvent, for a period ranging from 20 to 60 minutes, at a temperature in the range of 25 to 35°C, till uniform consistency is achieved and collecting the product in the form of a solution.
