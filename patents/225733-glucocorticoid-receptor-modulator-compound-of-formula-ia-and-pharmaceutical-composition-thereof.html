				<td>The present invention relates to glucocorticoid receptor modulator compound of formula (IA) and pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to glucocorticoid mimetics or ligands, methods of making such compounds, their use in pharmaceutical compositions, and their use in modulating the glucocorticoid receptor function, treating disease-states or conditions mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor function in a patient in need of such treatment, and other uses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Glucocorticoids, a class of corticosteroids, are endogenous hormones with profound effects on the immune system and multiple organ systems. They suppress a variety of immune and inflammatory functions by inhibition of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-i, IL-2, 1L-6, and TNF, inhibition of arachidoriic acid metabolites including prostaglandins and kukotrienes, depletion of T-lyrnphocytes, and reduction of the expression of adhesion molecules on cndothelial cells (P.J. Barnes, Ciin, Sci., 1998, 94 PP 551-572; P.J. Barnes et al, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1993, 14, pp. 436-441), In addition to these effects, glucocorticoids stimulate glucose production in the liver and catabolism of proteins, play a role in electrolyte and water balance, reduce calcium absorption, and inhibit osteoblast function.<br>
The anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive activities of endogenous glucocorticoids have stimulated the development of synthetic glucocorticoid derivatives including dexamethasone, prednisone, and prednisolone (L. Parente, Glucocorticoids. NJ, Goulding and RJ. Flowers (cds.), Boston: Birkhauscr, 2001, pp. 35-54). These have found wide use in the treatment of inflammatory, immune, and allergic disorders including rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, dermatological diseases including psoriasis and pemphigus, allergic disorders including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, pulmonary conditions including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other immune and inflammatory diseases including Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis (J. Toogood, Glucocorticoids. N..T. Goulding and R.J. Flowers (ecis.), Boston: Birkhauser, 2001, pp. 161-174}. They have also been used to help prevent rejection in organ transplantation.<br><br>
Unfortunately, in addition to the desired therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids, their use is<br>
associated with a number of adverse side effects, some of which can be severe and lifethreatening.<br>
These include alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, edema, weight gain,<br>
hypertension, muscle weakness, development or aggravation of diabetes mellitus, and<br>
osteoporosis. Therefore, a compound that exhibited a reduced side effect profile while<br>
maintaining the potent anti-inflammatory effects would be particularly desirable especially<br>
when treating a chronic disease.<br>
The effects of glucocorticoids are mediated at the cellular level by the glucocorticoid receptor<br>
(R.H. Oakley and J. Cidlowski, Glucocorticoids. N.J. Goulding and R.J. Flowers (eds.), Boston:<br>
Birkhauser, 2001, pp. 55-80). The glucocorticoid receptor is a member of a class of structurally<br>
related intracellular receptors that when coupled with a ligand can function as a transcription<br>
factor that affects gene expression (R.M. Evans, Science, 1988, 240, pp. 889-895). Other<br>
members of the family of steroid receptors include the mineralocorticoid, progesterone,<br>
estrogen, and androgen receptors. In addition to the effects mentioned above for<br>
glucocorticoids, hormones that act on this receptor family have a profound influence on body<br>
homeostasis, mineral metabolism, the stress response, and development of sexual<br>
characteristics. Glucocorticoids. N.J. Goulding and RJ. Flowers (eds.), Boston: Birkhauser,<br>
2001, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety to better describe the state of the art.<br>
A molecular mechanism which accounts for the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects and the<br>
undesired side effects has been proposed (e.g., S. Heck et al, EMBO J, 1994, .17, PP- 4087-<br>
4095; H.M. Reichardt et al, Cell, 1998, 93, pp. 531-541; F. Tranche et al, Curr. Opin. in<br>
Genetics and Dev., 1998, 8, pp. 532-538). Many of the metabolic and cardiovascular side<br>
effects are thought to be the result of a process called transactivation. In transactivation, the<br>
translocation of the ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor to the nucleus is followed by binding<br>
to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter region of side effect-associated<br>
genes, for example, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK), in the case of increased<br>
glucose production. The result is an increased transcription rate of these genes which is<br>
believed to result, ultimately, in the observed side effects. The anti-inflammatory effects are<br>
thought to be due to a process called transrepression. In general, transrepression is a process<br>
independent of DNA binding that results from inhibition of NF-kB and AP-1-mediated<br>
pathways, leading to down regulation of many inflammatory and immune mediators.<br>
Additionally, it is believed that a number of the observed side effects may be due to the crossreactivity<br>
of the currently available glucocorticoids with other steroid receptors, particularly the<br>
mineralocorticoid and progesterone receptors.<br>
Thus, it may be possible to discover ligands for the glucocorticoid recdptor that are highly<br>
selective and, upon binding, can dissociate the transactivation and transrepression pathways,<br>
providing therapeutic agents with a reduced side effect profile. Assay systems to determine<br>
effects on transactivation and transrepression have been described (e.g., C.M. Bamberger and<br>
H.M. Schulte, Eur. J. Clin. Invest., 2000, 30 (suppl. 3), pp. 6-9). Selectivity for the<br>
glucocorticoid receptor may be determined by comparing the binding affinity for this receptor<br>
with that of other steroid family receptors including those mentioned above.<br>
Glucocorticoids also stimulate the production of glucose in the liver by a process called<br>
gluconeogenesis and it is believed that this process is mediated by transactivation events.<br>
Increased glucose production can exacerbate type II diabetes, therefore a compound that<br>
selectivity inhibited glucocorticoid mediated glucose production may have therapeutic utility in<br>
this indication (I.E. Freidman et al.,3. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, pp. 31475-31481).<br>
Novel ligands for the glucocorticoid receptor have been described in the scientific and patent<br>
literature. For example, PCT International Publication No. WO 99/33786 discloses<br>
triphenylpropanamide compounds with potential use in treating inflammatory diseases. PCT<br>
International Publication No. WO 00/66522 describes non-steroidal compounds as selective<br>
modulators of the glucocorticoid receptor potentially useful in treating metabolic and<br>
inflammatory diseases. PCT International Publication No. WO 99/41256 describes tetracyclic<br>
modulators of the glucocorticoid receptor potentially useful in treating immune, autoimmune,<br>
and inflammatory diseases. U.S. Patent No. 5,688,810 describes various non-steroidal<br>
compounds as modulators of glucocorticoid and other steroid receptors. PCT International<br>
Publication No. WO 99/63976 describes a non-steroidal, liver-selective glucocorticoid<br>
antagonist potentially useful in the treatment of diabetes. PCT International Publication No.<br>
WO 00/32584 discloses non-steroidal compounds having anti-inflammatory activity with<br>
dissociation between anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects. PCT International Publication<br>
No. WO 98/54159 describes non-steroidal cyclically substituted acylanilides with mixed<br>
gestagen and androgen activity. U.S. Patent No. 4,880,839 describes acylanilides having<br>
progestational activity and EP 253503 discloses acylanilides with antiandrogenic properties.<br>
PCT International Publication No. WO 97/27852 describes amides that are inhibitors of<br>
farnesyl-protein transferase.<br>
A compound that is found to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor in a binding assay could<br>
be an agonist or an antagonist. The agonist properties of the compound could be evaluated in<br>
the transactivation or transrepression assays described above. Given the efficacy demonstrated<br>
by available glucocorticoid drugs in inflammatory and immune diseases and their adverse side<br>
effects, there remains a need for novel glucocorticoid receptor agonists with selectivity over<br>
other members of the steroid receptor family and a dissociation of the transactivation and<br>
transrepression activities. Alternatively, the compound may be found to have antagonist<br>
activity. As mentioned above, glucocorticoids stimulate glucose production in the liver.<br>
Increased glucose production induced by glucocorticoid excess can exacerbate existing<br>
diabetes, or trigger latent diabetes. Thus a ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor that is found<br>
to be an antagonist may be useful, inter alia, for treating or preventing diabetes.<br>

The term "compounds of Formula (I)" and equivalent expressions are mean to embrace either<br>
or both of compounds of Formula (IA) and compounds of Formula (IB) as the context permits.<br>
The term "compounds of the invention" and equivalent expressions are meant to embrace<br>
compounds of Formula (I) as herein described, including the tautomers, the prodrugs, the salts,<br>
particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the solvates and hydrates thereof, where<br>
the context so permits. In general and preferably, the compounds of the invention and the<br><br>
Formulas designating the compounds of the invention are understood to only include the stable compounds thereof and exclude unstable compounds, even if an unstable compound might be considered to be literally embraced by the compound formula. Similarly, reference to intermediates, whether or not they themselves are claimed, is meant to embrace their salts and solvates, where the context so permits. For the sake of clarity, particular instances when the context so permits are sometimes indicated in the text, but these instances are purely illustrative and it is not intended to exclude other instances when the context so permits.<br>
The terms "optional" or "optionally" mean that the subsequently described event or circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally substituted aryl" means that the aryl radical may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both substituted aryl radicals and aryl radicals having no substitution.<br>
The terms "stable compound" or "stable structure" mean a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic or diagnostic agent. For example, a compound which would have a "dangling valency" or is a carbanion is not a compound contemplated by the invention.<br>
The term "substituted" means that any one or more hydrogens on an atom of a group or moiety, whether specifically designated or not, is replaced with a selection from the indicated group of substituents, provided that the atom's normal valency is not exceeded and that the substitution results in a stable compound. If a bond to a substituent is shown to cross the bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. For example, when the substituent is piperazinyl, piperidinyl, or tetrazolyl, unless specified otherwise, such piperazinyl, piperidinyl, or tetrazolyl group may be bonded to the rest of the compound of the invention via any atom in such piperazinyl, piperidinyl, or tetrazolyl group. Generally, when any substituent or group occurs more than one time in any constituent or compound, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0 to 2 R5, then such<br><br>
group is optionally substituted with up to two R5 groups and R5 at each occurrence is selected independently from the defined list of possible R5. Such combinations of substituents and/or variables, however, are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the term "about" or "approximately" means within 20%, preferably within 10%, and more preferably within 5% of a given value or range.<br>
The yield of each of the reactions described herein is expressed as a percentage of the theoretical yield.<br>
B.   Salt, Prodrug, Derivative, and Solvate Terms and Conventions<br>
The terms "prodrug" or "prodrug derivative" mean a covalently-bonded derivative or carrier of the parent compound or active drug substance which undergoes at least some biotransformation prior to exhibiting its pharmacological effect(s). In general, such prodrugs have metabolically cleavable groups and are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound, for example, by hydrolysis in blood, and generally include esters and amide analogs of the parent compounds. The prodrug is formulated with the objectives of improved chemical stability, improved patient acceptance and compliance, improved bioavailability, prolonged duration of action, improved organ selectivity, improved formulation (e.g., increased hydrosolubility), and/or decreased side effects (e.g., toxicity). In general, prodrugs themselves have weak or.no biological activity and are stable under ordinary conditions. Prodrugs can be readily prepared from the parent compounds using methods known in the art, such as those described in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard (eds.), Gordon &amp; Breach, 1991, particularly Chapter 5: "Design and Applications of Prodrugs"; Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard (ed.), Elsevier, 1985; Prodrugs: Topical anfl Ocular Drug Delivery. K.B. Sloan (ed.), Marcel Dekker, 1998; Methods in Enzymology. K. Widder et al.

The term "salt" means an ionic form of the parent compound or the product of the reaction between the parent compound with a suitable acid or base to make the acid salt or base salt of the parent compound. Salts of the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compounds which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts are prepared by reacting the free base or acid parent compound with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid or base in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means a salt of a compound of the invention which is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, generally water or oil-soluble or dispersible, and effective for their intended use. The term includes pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts and pharmaceutically-acceptable base addition salts. As the compounds of the present invention are useful in both free base and salt form, in practice, the use of the salt form amounts to use of the base form. Lists of suitable salts are found in, e.g., S.M. Birge et at, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66. pp. 1-19, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>

Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic nontoxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, quaternary amine compounds, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion-exchange resins, such as methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, isopropylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, tetramethylammonium compounds, tetraethylammonium compounds, pyridine, 7V,./V-dimethylaniline, ./V-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, dibenzylamine, AyV-dibenzylphenethylarnine, 1-ephenamine, 7V,./V-dibenzylethylenediamine, polyamine resins, and the like.

The term "solvate" means a physical association of a compound with one or more solvent molecules or a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (for example, a compound of Formula (I)) and a solvent, for example, water, ethanol, or acetic acid. This physical association may involve varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen<br><br>
bonding. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example, when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. In general, the solvents selected do not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Solvates encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Representative solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and the like.<br>
The term "hydrate" means a solvate wherein the solvent molecule(s) is/are H2O.<br>

Such forms, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable forms, are intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br>
C.   Isomer Terms and Conventions<br>
The term "isomers" means compounds having the same number and kind of atoms, and hence the same molecular weight, but differing with respect to the arrangement or configuration of the atoms in space. The term includes stereoisomers and geometric isomers.<br>
The terms "stereoisomer" or "optical isomer" mean a stable isomer that has at least one chiral atom or restricted rotation giving rise to perpendicular dissymmetric planes (e.g., certain biphenyls, allenes, and spiro compounds) and can rotate plane-polarized light. Because asymmetric centers and other chemical structure exist in the compounds of the invention which may give rise to stereoisomerism, the invention contemplates stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. The compounds of the invention and their salts include asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exist as single stereoisomers, racemates, and as mixtures of enantiomers and diastereomers. Typically, such compounds will be prepared as a racemic mixture. If desired, however, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. As discussed in more detail below, individual stereoisomers of compounds are prepared by synthesis from optically active starting materials containing the desired chiral centers or by preparation of mixtures of enantiomeric products followed by separation or resolution, such as conversion to a mixture of<br><br>
diastereomers followed by separation or recrystallization, chromatographic techniques, use of chiral resolving agents, or direct separation of the enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns. Starting compounds of particular stereochemistry are either commercially available or are made by the methods described below and resolved by techniques well-known in the art.<br>
The term "enantiomers" means a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.<br>
The terms "diastereoisomers" or "diastereomers" mean optical isomers which are not mirror images of each other.<br>
The terms "racemic mixture" or "racemate" mean a mixture containing equal parts of individual enantiomers.<br>
The term "non-racemic mixture" means a mixture containing unequal parts of individual enantiomers. -<br>
The term "geometrical isomer" means a stable isomer which results from restricted freedom of rotation about double bonds (e.g., cj.s-2-butene and /ran.s-2-butene) or in a cyclic structure (e.g., c«-l,3-dichlorocyclobutane and frYws-l,3-dichlorocyclobutane). Because carbon-carbon double (olefinic) bonds, C=N double bonds, cyclic structures, and the like may be present in the compounds of the invention, the invention contemplates each of the various stable geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the arrangement of substituents around these double bonds and in these cyclic structures. The substituents and the isomers are designated using the cisltrans convention or using the E or Z system, wherein the term "E" means higher order substituents on opposite sides of the double bond, and the term "Z" means higher order substituents on the same side of the double bond. A thorough discussion of E and Z isomerism is provided in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. 4th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Several of the following examples represent single E isomers, single Z isomers, and mixtures of E/Z isomers. Determination of the E and Z isomers can be done by analytical methods such as x-ray crystallography, !H NMR, and 13C NMR.<br><br>
Some of the compounds of the invention can exist in more than one tautomeric form. As mentioned above, the compounds of the invention include all such tautomers.<br>
It is well-known in the art that the biological and pharmacological activity of a compound is sensitive to the stereochemistry of the compound. Thus, for example, enantiomers often exhibit strikingly different biological activity including differences in pharmacokinetic properties, including metabolism, protein binding, and the like, and pharmacological properties, including the type of activity displayed, the degree of activity, toxicity, and the like. Thus, one skilled in the art will appreciate that one enantiomer may be more active or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other enantiomer or when separated from the other enantiomer. Additionally, one skilled in the art would know how to separate, enrich, or selectively prepare the enantiomers of the compounds of the invention from this disclosure and the knowledge of the prior art.<br>
Thus, although the racemic form of drug may be used, it is often less effective than administering an equal amount of enantiomerically pure drug; indeed, in some cases, one enantiomer may be pharmacologically inactive and would merely serve as a simple diluent. For example, although ibuprofen had been previously administered as a racemate, it has been shown that only the .S'-isomer of ibuprofen is effective as an anti-inflammatory agent (in the case of ibuprofen, however, although the 7?-isomer is inactive, it is converted in vivo to the .S'-isomer, thus, the rapidity of action of the racemic form of the drug is less than that of the pure .S'-isomer). Furthermore, the pharmacological activities of enantiomers may have distinct biological activity. For example, S-penicillamine is a therapeutic agent for chronic arthritis, while J?-penicillamine is toxic. Indeed, some purified enantiomers have advantages over the racemates, as it has been reported that purified individual isomers have faster transdermal penetration rates compared to the racemic mixture. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,114,946 and 4,818,541.<br>
Thus, if one enantiomer is pharmacologically more active, less toxic, or has a preferred disposition in the body than the other enantiomer, it would be therapeutically more beneficial to administer that enantiomer preferentially. In this way, the patient undergoing treatment would<br><br>
be exposed to a lower total dose of the drug and to a lower dose of an enantiomer that is possibly toxic or an inhibitor of the other enantiomer.<br>
Preparation of pure enantiomers or mixtures of desired enantiomeric excess (ee) or enantiomeric purity are accomplished by one or more of the many methods of (a) separation or resolution of enantiomers, or (b) enantioselective synthesis known to those of skill in the art, or a combination thereof. These resolution methods generally rely on chiral recognition and include, for example, chromatography using chiral stationary phases, enantioselective host-guest complexation, resolution or synthesis using chiral auxiliaries, enantioselective synthesis, enzymatic and nonenzymatic kinetic resolution, or spontaneous enantioselective crystallization. Such methods are disclosed generally in Chiral Separation Techniques: A Practical Approach (2nd Ed.), G. Subramanian (ed.), Wiley-VCH, 2000; T.E. Beesley and R.P.W. Scott, Chiral Chromatography, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999; and Satinder Ahuja, Chiral Separations by Chromatography, Am. Chem. Soc., 2000. Furthermore, there are equally well-known methods for the quantitation of enantiomeric excess or purity, for example, GC, HPLC, CE, or NMR, and assignment of absolute configuration and conformation, for example, CD ORD, X-ray crystallography, or NMR.<br>
In general, all tautomeric forms and isomeric forms and mixtures, whether individual geometric isomers or stereoisomers or racemic or non-racemic mixtures, of a chemical structure or compound is intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated in the compound name or structure.<br>

General Synthetic Methods for Making Compounds of Formula (IA) and Formula (IB) The invention also provides processes for making compounds of Formula (IA) and Formula (IB). In all schemes, unless specified otherwise, R1 to R5 in the formulas below shall have the meaning of R1 to R5 in the Formula (IA) of the invention described hereinabove; and where appropriate, R1 to R6 in the formulas below shall have the meaning of R1 to R6 in the Formula (IB) of the invention described hereinabove. Intermediates used in the preparation of compounds of the invention are either commercially available or readily prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times may vary depending on the particular reactants used. Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may be readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific procedures are provided in the Experimental Examples section. Typically, reaction progress may be monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC), if desired, and intermediates and products may be purified by chromatography on silica gel and/or by recrystallization.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by the method outlined in Scheme I.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme I<br>
As illustrated in Scheme I, an ester intermediate of Formula (II) where R' is Me or Et, is reduced with a suitable reducing agent, such as lithium aluminum hydride, in a suitable solvent, such as THF or diethy! ether, to produce the 1,2-diol of Formula (III). Oxidative cleavage of 1.2-diols is well-known in the art and may be achieved with periodic acid or lead tetraacetate, for example, in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, to provide the ketone (IV). Reaction of ketone (IV) with a suitable organometallic reagent R5R4M, such as a Grignard reagent (M is MgBr or MgCl) or an organolithium reagent (M is Li), in a suitable solvent such as THF or diethyl ether provides the desired compound of Formula (I). Such organolithium reagents and alkylmagnesium halides or Grignard reagents are well-known in the art^ for example, Grignard reagents are easily prepared by reacting the corresponding alkyl halide with magnesium metal in a suitable solvent, such as ether or THF, under anhydrous conditions.<br>
Scheme II outlines another approach that may be used to obtain compounds of Formula (I). <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme II<br>
In Scheme II, the hydroxyl function on intermediate (II) is protected to provide ester (V). Hydroxyl protecting groups are well-known in the art, an example of a suitable protecting group is a methoxymethyl ether. Reduction of the ester (V) with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride provides alcohol (VI). Oxidation of alcohol (VI) with an oxidizing agent such as pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) provides aldehyde (VII). Treatment of aldehyde (VII) with a suitable organometallic reagent R5M where M is Li or MgX, and X is Cl, Br, or I, that is, an organolithium reagent or Grignard reagent or alkylmagnesium halide bearing R5, provides alcohol (VIII). Deprotection by standard methods, which would depend on the protecting group used, gives the desired compound of Formula (I) where R4 is -CH(OH)-. Oxidation of alcohol (VIII) to (IX) with an oxidizing agent such as PCC or 1,1,1-triacetoxy-l,l-dihydro-l,2-benziodoxol-3(l#)-one, followed by deprotection provides the desired compound of Formula (I) where R4 is -C(O)-.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may also be prepared by the method outlined in Scheme III.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme III<br>
In this approach, trifluoroacetic anhydride and W,0-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride are coupled under basic conditions to afford trifluoroacetamide (X) (Weinreb amide). The Weinreb amide (X) is reacted with a vinyl magnesium bromide bearing R2 and R3 to afford the trifluoromethylenone intermediate (XI). The trifluoromethylenone intermediate (XI) is treated with an organocopper reagent, derived from a Grignard or organolithium reagent by treating with a copper salt, to afford the 1,4-addition product (IV). This trifluoro ketone intermediate (IV) is reacted with an organometallic reagent R4R5M (as described in Scheme I) to afford the desired compound of Formula (I).<br>

Scheme IV<br>
As illustrated in Scheme IV, trifluoromethyl ketone (IV) is reacted with ethyl acetate in the presence of a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in a suitable solvent such as THF. The intermediate ester is hydrolyzed, for example, by treatment with aqueous base, to provide carboxylic acid intermediate (XII). This carboxylic acid intermediate (XII) is then coupled with an optionally substituted o-phenylenediamine under standard coupling conditions known in the art, for example, by treatment with l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in a suitable solvent such as DMF, to provide compound (XIII). Ring closure by methods known in the art, for example, acid catalyzed ring closure by treatment with polyphosphoric acid, provides the desired compound of Formula (I).<br>

Scheme V<br>
In Scheme V, substituted phenol (XIV) is reacted with an acryloyl chloride bearing R2 and R3 (XV) in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, to provide an intermediate ester which is. cyclized by treatment with a Lewis acid, such as aluminum trichloride, in a suitable solvent, such as carbon disulfide, to provide lactone (XVI). The lactone (XVI) is treated with a<br>
suitable amine HNR"R'"( such as morphoiine, such that in the resulting amide (XVII), -NR'H"1" will function as a leaving group in the subsequent reaction. The intermediate phenol that forms is protected, for example, by reaction with methyl iodide in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium hydroxide to form the protected phenol (XVII), in this case having a methcxy group. The amide is then reacted with an organometallic reagent (R6M), such as a Grignard reagent (M is MgBr or MgCl) or an organolithium reagent (M is Li), in a suitable solvent, such as THF or diethyl ether, to provide the ketone (XVIII). Reaction of the ketone (XVIII) with R5R4M as described in the last step in Scheme I provides the desired compound of Formula (IB) where R1 is an optionally substituted methoxyphenyl group,<br>
In a more general procedure, suitable for a variety of R1, one may use a method analogous to that described in Scheme III. As illustrated in Scheme VI, using a Weinreb amide bearing R6 one may employ the method described in Scheme III to prepare the desired compound of Formula (IB),<br><br><br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
An alternative method to prepare intermediate (IV), used in the methods ilJustrated in Schemes I-IV, ss illustrated in Scheme VII,<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In Scheme VII, a ketone bearing R1 and R2 (XIX) is reacted with a cyanoacetic acid ester, such as the methyl ester (XX) under condensation conditions known in the art to provide the olefin (XXI). Reaction of olefin (XXI) with R3Li in the presence of a copper salt such as Cul provides compound (XXII). Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of compound (XXII) results in nitrile (XXIII). Reduction of nitrile (XXIII), for example, by treatment with diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL), provides aldehyde (XXIV). Treatment of aldehyde (XXIV) with trimethyl(trifluoromethyl)silane in the presence of an ammonium salt such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride provides alcohol (XXV). Oxidation of alcohol (XXV) by methods known in the art, such as by treatment with the Dess-Martin periodinane, provides compound (IV).<br>

Assessment of Biological Properties<br>
Compounds of the invention were evaluated for binding to the steroid receptor by a fluorescence polarization competitive binding assay. Detailed descriptions for preparation of recombinant glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complex used in the assay is described in U.S. provisional application No. 60/291,877, filed May 18, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Preparation of the tetramethyl rhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled dexamethasone probe was accomplished using a standard literature procedure (M. Pons et al, J. Steroid Biochem., 1985, 22, pp. 267-273).<br>
A. Glucocorticoid Receptor Competitive Binding Assay<br>
Step 1. Characterization of the Fluorescent Probe<br>
The wavelengths for maximum excitation and emission of the fluorescent probe should first be<br>
measured. An example of such a probe is rhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled dexamethasone.<br>
The affinity of the probe for the steroid receptor was then determined in a titration experiment. The fluorescence polarization value of the probe in assay buffer was measured on an SLM-8100 fluorometer using the excitation and emission maximum values described above. Aliquots of expression vector lysate were added and fluorescence polarization was measured after each addition until no further change in polarization value was observed. Non-linear least squares regression analysis was used to calculate the dissociation constant of the probe from the polarization values obtained for lysate binding to the probe.<br>
Step 2. Screening for Inhibitors of Probe Binding<br>
This assay uses fluorescence polarization (FP) to quantitate the ability of test compounds to compete with tetramethyl rhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled dexamethasone for binding to a human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complex prepared from an insect expression system. The assay buffer was: 10 mM TES, 50 mM KC1, 20 mM Na2MoO4»2H2O, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.04% w/v CHAPS, 10% v/v glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. Test compounds were dissolved to 1 mM in neat DMSO and then further diluted to lOx assay concentration in assay buffer supplemented with 10% v/v DMSO. Test compounds were serially diluted at lOx assay concentrations in 10% DMSO-containing buffer in 96-well polypropylene plates. Binding reaction mixtures were prepared in 96-well black Dynex microtiter plates by sequential addition of the following assay components to each well: 15 uL of lOx test compound solution, 85 uL of GR-containing baculovirus lysate diluted 1:170 in assay buffer, and 50 uL of 15 nM TAMRA-labeled dexamethasone. Positive controls were reaction mixtures containing no test compound; negative controls (blanks) were reaction mixtures containing 0.7 uM to 2 uM dexamethasone. The binding reactions were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then read for fluorescence polarization in the LJL Analyst set to 550 nm excitation and 580 ran emission, with the Rhodamine 561 dichroic mirror installed. ICso values were determined by iterative non-linear curve fitting of the FP signal data to a 4-parameter logistic equation.<br><br>
Compounds found to bind to the glucocorticoid receptor may be evaluated for binding to the progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) to evaluate the compound's selectivity for GR. The protocols for PR and MR are identical to the above GR method, with the following exceptions: PR insect cell lysate is diluted 1:7.1 and MR lysate diluted 1:9.4. PR probe is TAMRA-labeled mifepristone, used at a final concentration of 5 nM in the assay, and the negative controls (blanks) were reactions containing mifepristone at 0.7 [oM to 2<br>
The ER protocol is similar to the above protocols, but uses PanVera kit receptor, fluorescein-labeled probe. The assay components are made in the same volumes as above, to produce final assay concentrations for ER of 15 nM and ES2 probe of 1 nM. In addition, the component order of addition is modified from the above assays: probe is added to the plate first, followed by receptor and test compound. The plates are read in the LJL Analyst set to 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission, with the Fluorescein 505 dichroic mirror installed.<br>
Compounds found to bind to the glucocorticoid receptor may be evaluated for dissociation of transactivation and transrepression by assays cited in the Background of the Invention (C.M. Bamberger and H.M. Schulte, Eur. J. Clin. Invest., 2000, 30 (suppl. 3) 6-9) or by the assays described below.<br>
B. Glucocorticoid Receptor Cell Assays<br>
1. Induction ofAromatase in Fibroblasts (Cell Assay for Transactivation)<br>
Dexamethasone, a synthetic ligand to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), induces expression of<br>
aromatase in human foreskin fibroblast cells.   The activity of aromatase is measured by the<br>
conversion of testosterone to estradiol in culture media. Compounds that exhibit binding to GR<br>
are evaluated for their ability to induce aromatase activity in human foreskin fibroblasts.<br>
Human foreskin fibroblast cells (ATCC Cat. No. CRL-2429, designation CCD112SK) are plated on 96 well plates at 50,000 cells per well 5 days before use, in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media (GibcoBRL Life Technologies Cat No. 12440-053) supplemented with 10% charcoal filtered FBS (Clonetech Cat No. SH30068) and Gentamycin (GibcoBRL Life<br>
Technologies Cat. No. 15710-064). On the day of the experiment, the media in the wells is replaced with fresh media. Cells are treated with test compounds to final concentrations of 10"5 M to 10"8 M, and testosterone to a final concentration of 300 ng/mL. Each well has a total volume of 100 \iL. Samples are made in duplicates. Control wells include: (a) wells that receive testosterone only, and (b) wells that receive testosterone plus 2 juM of dexamethasone to provide maximum induction of aromatase. Plates are incubated at 37°C overnight (15 to 18 hours), and supernatants are harvested at the end of incubation. Estradiol in the supernatant is measured using ELISA kits for estradiol (made by ALPCO, obtained from American Laboratory Products Cat. No, 020-DR-2693) according to the manufacture's instruction. The amount of estradiol is inversely proportional to the ELISA signals in each well. The extent of aromatase induction by test compounds is expressed as a relative percentage to dexamethasone. values of test compounds are derived by non-linear curve fitting.<br>
2. Inhibition of IL-6 Production in Fibroblasts (Cell Assay for Transrepression) Human foreskin fibroblast cells produce IL-6 in response to stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 . This inflammatory response, as measured by the production of IL-6, can be effectively inhibited by dexamethasone, a synthetic ligand to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Compounds that exhibit binding to GR are evaluated for their ability to inhibit IL-6 production in human foreskin fibroblasts.<br>
Human foreskin fibroblast cells (ATCC Cat. No. CRL-2429) are plated on 96 well plates at 5,000 cells per well the day before use, in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media (GibcoBRL Life Technologies Cat. No. 12440-053) supplemented with 10% charcoal filtered FBS (Clonetech Cat. No. SH30068) and Gentamycin (GibcoBRL Life Technologies Cat. No. 15710-064). On the next day, media in the wells is replaced with fresh media. Cells are treated with IL-1 (rhIL-la, R&amp;D Systems Cat. No. 200-LA) to a final concentration of 1 ng/mL, and with test compounds to final concentrations of 10'5 M to 10"8 M, in a total volume of 200 uL per ivell. Samples are done in duplicates. Background control wells do not receive test compounds jr IL-1. Positive control wells receive IL-1 only and represent maximum (or 100%) amount of L-6 production. Plates are incubated at 37°C overnight (15 to 18 hours), and supernatants are harvested at the end of incubation. IL-6 levels in the supernatants are determined by the ELISA kits for IL-6 (MedSystems Diagnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria, Cat. No. BMS213TEN)<br>
according to manufacture's instructions. The extent of inhibition of IL-6 by test compounds is expressed in percentage relative to positive controls. ICso values of test compounds are derived by non-linear curve fitting.<br>
Evaluation of agonist or antagonist activity of compounds binding to the glucocorticoid receptor may be determined by any of the assays.<br>
3.	Modulation of Tyrosine Aminotransferase (TAT) Induction in Rat Hepatoma Cells<br>
Testing   of  compounds   for   agonist   or   antagonist   activity   in   induction   of tyrosine<br>
aminotransferase (TAT) in rat hepatoma cells.<br>
H4-II-E-C3 cells were incubated overnight in 96 well plates (20,000 cells/100 uL/well) in MEM medium containing 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% nonessential amino acids. On the next day, cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of dexamethasone or test compound (dissolved in DMSO, final DMSO concentration 0.2%) for 18 hours. Control cells were treated with 0.2% DMSO. After 18 hours, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and the TAT activity was measured in a photometric assay using tyrosine and alpha-ketoglutarate as substrates.<br>
For measuring antagonist activity, the hepatoma cells were pre-stimulated by addition of dexamethasone (concentration ranges from 3 x 10"9 M to 3 x 10"8 M) shortly before the test compound was applied to the cells. The steroidal non-selective GR/PR antagonist mifepristone was used as control.<br>
4.	Modulation ofMMTV-Luc Induction in HeLa Cells<br>
Testing of compounds for agonist or antagonist activity in stimulation of MMTV-(mouse<br>
mammary tumor virus) promoter in HeLa cells.<br>
t<br>
HeLa cells were stably co-transfected with the pHHLuc-plasmid containing a fragment of the MMTV-LTR (-200 to +100 relative to the transcription start site) cloned in front of the luciferase gene (Norden, 1988) and the pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) constitutively<br>
expressing the resistance for the selective antibiotic GENETICIN®. Clones with best induction of the MMTV-promoter were selected and used for further experiments.<br>
Cells were cultured overnight in DMEM medium without phenol red, supplemented with 3% CCS (charcoal treated calf serum) and then transferred to 96 well plates (15,000 cells/100 uL/well). On the next day, activation of the MMTV-promoter was stimulated by addition of test compound or dexamethasone dissolved in DMSO (final concentration 0.2%). Control cells were treated with DMSO only. After 18 hours, the cells were lysed with cell lysis reagent (Promega, Cat. No. E1531), luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Cat. No. E1501) was added and the glow luminescence was measured using a luminometer (BMG, Offenburg).<br>
For measuring antagonist activity, the MMTV-promoter was pre-stimulated by adding dexamethasone (3 x 10"9 M to 3 x 10"8 M) shortly before the test compound was applied to the cells. The steroidal non-selective GR/PR antagonist mifepristone was used as control.<br>
5.	Modulation ofIL-8 Production in U937 Cells<br>
Testing of compounds for agonist or antagonist activity in GR-mediated inhibition of LPS-induced IL-8 secretion in U-937 cells.<br>
U-937 cells were incubated for 2 to 4 days in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% CCS (charcoal treated calf serum). The cells were transferred to 96 well plates (40,000 cells/100 uL/well) and stimulated with 1 u£/mL LPS (dissolved in PBS) in the presence or absence of dexamethasone or test compound (dissolved in DMSO, final concentration 0.2%). Control cells were treated with 0.2% DMSO. After 18 hours, the IL-8 concentration in the cell supernatant was measured by ELISA, using the "OptEIA human IL-8 set" (Pharmingen, Cat. No. 2654KI).<br>
For measuring antagonist activity, the LPS-induced IL-8 secretion was inhibited by adding dexamethasone (3 x 10"9 M to 3 x 10"8 M) shortly before the test compound was applied to the cells. The steroidal non-selective GR/PR antagonist mifepristone was used as control.<br>
6.	Modulation oflCAM-Luc Expression in HeLa Cells<br>
Testing of compounds for agonist or antagonist activity in inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced activation of the ICAM-promoter in HeLa cells.<br>
HeLa cells were stably co-transfected with a plasmid containing a 1.3 kb fragment of the human ICAM-promoter (-1353 to -9 relative to the transcription start site, Ledebur and Parks, 1995) cloned in front of the luciferase gene and the pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) which constitutively expresses the resistance for the antibiotic GENETICIN®. Clones with best induction of the ICAM-promoter were selected and used for further experiments. Cells were transferred to 96 well plates (15,000 cells/100 uL/well) in DMEM medium supplemented with 3% CCS. On the following day the activation of the ICAM-promoter was induced by addition of 10 ng/mL recombinant TNF-alpha (R&amp;D System, Cat. No. 210-TA). Simultaneously the cells were treated with the test compound or dexamethasone (dissolved in DMSO, final concentration 0.2%). Control cells were treated with DMSO only. After 18 hours, the cells were lysed with cell lysis reagent (Promega, Cat. No. E1531), luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Cat. No. El501) was added and glow luminescence was measured using a luminometer (BMG, Offenburg).<br>
For measuring antagonist activity, the TNF-alpha-induced activation of the ICAM-promoter was inhibited by adding dexamethasone (3 x 10'9 M to 3 x 10"8 M) shortly before the test compound was applied to the cells. The steroidal non-selective GR/PR antagonist mifepristone was used as control.<br>
In general, the preferred potency range in the above assays is between 0.1 nM and 10 uM, the more preferred potency range is 0.1 nM to 1 uM, and the most preferred potency range is 0.1 nMtolOOnM.<br>

In addition, the compounds according to the invention can be used for the treatment of any other disease-states or conditions not mentioned above which have been treated, are treated, or will be treated with synthetic glucocorticoids (see, e.g., H.J. Hatz, Glucocorticoide: Immunologische Grundlagen. Pharmakologie und Therapierichtlinien [Glucocorticoids: Immunological Fundamentals, Pharmacology, and Therapeutic Guidelines], Stuttgart: Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Most or all of the indications (i) through (xx) mentioned above are described in detail in H.J. Hatz, Glucocorticoide: Immunologische Grundlagen, Pharmakologie und Therapierichtlinien. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention can also be used to treat disorders other than those listed above or mentioned or discussed herein, including in the Background of the Invention.<br>
The antagonist compounds according to the invention, whether full antagonists or partial antagonists, can be used in patients as drugs for the treatment of the following disease-states or indications, without limitation: type II diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes); obesity; cardiovascular diseases; hypertension; arteriosclerosis; neurological diseases, such as psychosis and depression; adrenal and pituitary tumors; glaucoma; and Gushing syndrome based on an ACTH secreting tumor like pituitary adenoma. In particular, the compounds of the invention are useful for treating obesity and all disease-states and indications related to a deregulated fatty acids metabolism such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Using the compounds of the invention that are GR antagonists, it should be possible to antagonize both the carbohydrate metabolism and fatty acids metabolism. Thus, the antagonist compounds of the invention are useful in treating all disease-states and conditions that involve increased carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism and would include disease-states and conditions leading to catabolism like muscle frailty (as an example of protein metabolism).<br>
Methods of Diagnostic Use<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used in diagnostic applications and for commercial and other purposes as standards in competitive binding assays. In such uses, the compounds of the invention may be used in the form of the compounds themselves or they may be modified by attaching a radioisotope, luminescence, fluorescent label or the like in order to obtain a radioisotope, luminescence, or fluorescent probe, as would be known by one of skill in the art and as outlined in Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Edition, R.P.

General Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
When used as Pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared using procedures well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the compounds of the invention, facilitate<br>
administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increased inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like. The compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances. In general, the compounds of this invention are administered in a therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective amount, but may be administered in lower amounts for diagnostic or other purposes.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention are useful in combination with glucocorticoids or corticosteroids. As pointed out above, standard therapy for a variety of immune and inflammatory disorders includes administration of corticosteroids, which have the ability to suppress immunologic and inflammatory responses. (A.P. Truhan et al, Annals of Allergy, 1989, 62, pp. 375-391; J.D. Baxter, Hospital Practice, 1992, 27, pp. 111-134; R.P. Kimberly, Curr. Opin. Rheumatol., 1992, 4, pp. 325-331; M.H. Weisman, Curr. Opin. Rheumatol., 1995, 7, pp. 183-190; W. Sterry, Arch. Dermatol. Res., 1992, 284 (Suppl.), pp. S27-S29). While therapeutically beneficial, however, the use of corticosteroids is associated with a number of side effects, ranging from mild to possibly life threatening, especially with prolonged and/or high dose steroid usage. Accordingly, methods and compositions that enable the use of a lower effective dosage of corticosteroids (referred to as the "steroid sparing effect") would be highly desirable to avoid unwanted side effects. The compounds of the invention provide such a steroid sparing effect by achieving the desired therapeutic effect while allowing the use of lower doses and less frequent administration of glucocorticoids or corticosteroids.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the invention, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out using any of the accepted modes of administration of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, buccally (e.g., sublingually), nasally, parenterally, topically, transdermally, vaginally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions will generally include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of the invention as<br>
the/an active agent, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, vehicles, or combinations thereof. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, or additives as well as methods of making pharmaceutical compositions for various modes or administration are well-known to those of skill in the art. The state of the art is evidenced, e.g., by Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. 20th Edition, A. Gennaro (ed.), Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives. Michael &amp; Irene Ash (eds.), Gower, 1995; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. A.M. Kibbe (ed.), American Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 2000; H.C. Ansel and N.G. Popovish, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. 5th ed., Lea and Febiger, 1990; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to better describe the state of the art.<br>
As one of skill in the art would expect, the forms of the compounds of the invention utilized in a particular pharmaceutical formulation will be selected (e.g., salts) that possess suitable physical characteristics (e.g., water solubility) that is required for the formulation to be efficacious.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising a compound of the present invention in a flavored base, usually sucrose, and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of the present invention. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration can also be effected by means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Injectable pharmaceutical formulations are commonly based upon injectable sterile saline, phosphate-buffered saline, oleaginous suspensions, or other injectable carriers known in the art and are generally rendered sterile and isotonic with the blood. The injectable pharmaceutical formulations may therefore be provided as a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, including 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, fixed oils such as synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids such as oleic acid, and the like.<br>
Such injectable pharmaceutical formulations are formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or setting agents and suspending agents. Injectable compositions will generally contain from 0.1 to 5% w/w of a compound of the invention.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. For such oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable composition containing a compound(s) of the invention is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, pregelatinized starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose ether derivatives, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, citrate, propyl gallate, and the like. Such solid pharmaceutical formulations may include formulations, as are well-known in the art, to provide prolonged or sustained delivery of the drug to the gastrointestinal tract by any number of mechanisms, which include, but are not limited to, pH sensitive release from the dosage form based on the changing pH of the small intestine, slow erosion of a tablet or capsule, retention in the stomach based on the physical properties of the formulation, bioadhesion of the dosage form to the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract, or enzymatic release of the active drug from the dosage form.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds include emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs, optionally containing pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like. These compositions can also contain additional adjuvants such as wetting, emulsifying, suspending, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Topical dosage forms of the compounds include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants, eye ointments, eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollients in ointments and creams. Topical application may be once or more than once per day depending upon the usual medical considerations. Furthermore, preferred compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles.

The present invention relates to glucocorticoid receptor modulator compound of formula (IA) and pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to glucocorticoid mimetics or ligands, methods of making such compounds, their use in pharmaceutical compositions, and their use in modulating the glucocorticoid receptor function, treating disease-states or conditions mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor function in a patient in need of such treatment, and other uses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Glucocorticoids, a class of corlicosteroids, are endogenous hormones with profound effects on the immune system and multiple organ systems. They suppress a variety of immune and inflammatory functions by inhibition of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, 1L-6, and TNF, inhibition of arachidoriic acid metabolites including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, depletion of T-lyrnphocytes, and reduction of the expression of adhesion molecules on cndothelial cells (P.J. Barnes, Clin, Sci., 1998, 94, PP 557-572; P.J. Barnes et al, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1993, .14, pp. 436-441), hi addition to these effects, glucocorticoids stimulate glucose production in the liver and catabolism of proteins, play a role in electrolyte and water balance, reduce calcium absorption, and inhibit osteoblast function.<br>
The anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive activities of endogenous glucocorticoids have stimulated the development of synthetic glucocotticoid derivatives including dexamethasone, prednisone, and prednisolone (L. Parente, Glucocorticoids. NJ, Goulding and RJ. Flowers (cds.), Boston: Birkhauscr, 2001, pp. 35-54). These have found wide use in the treatment of inflammatory, immune, and allergic disorders including rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, dermatological diseases including psoriasis and pemphigus, allergic disorders including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, pulmonary conditions including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other immune and inflammatory diseases including Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis (J. Toogood, Glucocorticoids. N..T. Goulding and RJ. Flowers (ecis.), Boston: Birkhauser, 2001, pp. 161-174}. They have also been used to help prevent rejection in organ transplantation.<br>
