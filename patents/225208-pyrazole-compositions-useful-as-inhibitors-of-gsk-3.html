				<td>PYRAZOLE COMPOSITIONS USEFUL AS INHIBITORS OF GSK-3.<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application 60/400,967 filed August 2, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to inhibitors of protein kinases, especially glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a serine/threonine protein kinase. The invention also provides compositions comprising the inhibitors of the invention and methods utilizing those compositions in the treatment of various disorders, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, and psychiatric disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is protein kinases.<br>
[0004] Protein kinases mediate intracellular signal transduction. They do this by effecting a phosphoryl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. There are a number of kinases and pathways through which extracellular and other stimuli cause a variety of cellular responses to occur inside the cell. Examples of such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H2O2), cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (EL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus may affect one or more<br>
cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis and regulation of cell cycle.<br>
[0005] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.<br>
[0006] Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of a and (3 isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev., 10, 508-514 (2000)]. GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, CNS disorders such as manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [see, e.g., WO 99/65897; WO 00/38675; Kaytor and Orr, Curr. Opin. NeurobioL, 12, 275-8 (2000); Haq et al., J. Cell Biol, 151,117-30 (2000); Eldar-Finkelman, Trends Mol. Med, 8,126-32 (2002)]. These diseases are associated with the abnormal operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which GSK-3 plays a role.<br>
[0007] GSK-3 has been found to phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of regulatory proteins. These include glycogen synthase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme required for glycogen synthesis, the microtubule-associated protein Tau, the gene transcription factor b-catenin, the translation initiation factor elF-2B, as well as ATP citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-myc, c-myb, CREB, and CEPBa. These diverse targets implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
[0008] In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant for the treatment of type II diabetes, insulin-induced signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. GSK-3 is a negative regulator of the insulin-induced signal in this pathway. Normally, the presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase. The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased<br>
glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake [Klein et al., PNAS, 93, 8455-9 (1996); Cross et al., Biochem. J., 303, 21-26 (1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567 (1993); and Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299,123-128 (1994); Cohen and Frame, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. BioL, 2,769-76 (2001)]. However, where the insulin response is impaired in a diabetic patient, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood levels of glucose with acute and chronic effects that may ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It has also been reported that GSK-3 is overexpressed in patients with type II diabetes [WO 00/38675]. Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 are therefore useful for treating diabetic patients suffering from an impaired response to insulin.<br>
[0009] Apoptosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain damage (Li et al., 1997; Choi, et al., 1996; Charriaut-Marlangue et al., 1998; Grahm and Chen, 2001; Murphy et al., 1999; Nicotera et al., 1999). Recent publications indicate that activation of GSK-3b may be involved in apoptotic mechanisms (Kaytor and Orr, 2002; Gilbert et al., 2001). Studies in rat models of ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) showed increased GSK-3b expression is following ischemia (Wang et al., Brain Res, 859, 381-5,2000; Sasaki et al., Neurol Res, 23, 588-92 ,2001). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) reduced ischemic brain injury after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCO) in rats (Fisher et al. 1995; Song et al. 2002). Indeed, the neuroprotective effects of FGF demonstrated in ischemia models in rats may be mediated by a PI-3 kinase/AKT-dependent inactivation of GSK-3|3 (Hashimoto et al., 2002). Thus, inhibition of GSK-3b after a cerebral ischemic event may ameliorate ischemic brain damage.<br>
[0010] GSK-3 is also implicated in mycardial infarction. See Jonassen et al., Circ Res, 89:1191, 2001 (The reduction in myocardial infarction by insulin administration at reperfusion is mediated via Akt dependent signaling pathway); Matsui et al., Circulation, 104:330, 2001 (Akt activation preserves cardiac function and prevents cardiomyocyte injury after transient cardiac ischemia in vivo); Miao et al., J Mol Cell Cardiol, 32:2397, 2000 (Intracoronary, adenovirus-naediated Akt gene delivery in heart reduced gross infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo); and Fujio et al., Circulation et<br>
al., 101:660, 2000 (Akt signaling inhibits cardiac myocyte apoptosis in vitro and protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse heart).<br>
[0011] GSK-3 activity plays a role in head trauma. See Noshita et al., Neurobiol Dis, 9:294, 2002 (Upregulation of Akt/PI3-kinase pathway may be crucial for cell survival after traumatic brain injury) and Dietrich et al., J Neurotrauma, 13:309, 1996 (Posttraumatic administration of bFGF significantly reduced damaged cortical neurons &amp; total contusion volume in a rat model of traumatic brain injury). [0012] GSK-3 is also known to play a role in psychiatric disorders. See Eldar-Finkelman, Trends Mol Med, 8:126, 2002; Li et al., Bipolar Disord, 4:137, 2002 (LiC1 and Valproic acid, anti-psychotic, mood stabilizing drugs, decrease GSK3 activities and increase beta-catenin) and Lijam et al., Cell, 90:895, 1997 (Dishevelled KO mice showed abnormal social behavior and defective sensorimotor gating. Dishevelled, a cytoplamic protein involved in "WNT pathway, inhibits GSK3beta activities). [0013] It has been shown that GSK3 inhibition by lithium and valproic acid induces axonal remodeling and change synaptic connectivity. See Kaytor &amp; Orr, Curr Opin Neurobiol, 12:275, 2002 (Downregulation of GSK3 causes changes in mirotubule-associated proteins: tau, MAPI &amp; 2) and Hall et al., Mol Cell Neurosci, 20:257, 2002 (Lithium and valproic acid induces the formation of growth cone-like structures along the axons).<br>
[0014] GSK-3 activity is also associated with Alzheimer's disease. This disease is characterized by the presence of the well-known b-amyloid peptide and the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, in which Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites. GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal sites in cell and animal models. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation of Tau in cells [Lovestone et al., Curr. Biol, 4, 1077-86 (1994); and Brownlees et al., Neuroreport 8, 3251-55 (1997); Kaytor and Orr, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol, 12, 275-8 (2000)]. In transgenic mice overexpressing GSK3, significant increased Tau hyperphosphorylation and abnormal morphology of neurons were observed [Lucas et al., EMBO J, 20:27-39 (2001)]. Active GSK3 accumulates in cytoplasm of pretangled neurons, which can lead to neurofibrillary tangles in brains of patients with AD [Pei et al., J Neuropathol Exp Neurol, 58,1010-19 (1999)]. Therefore, inhibition of GSK-3 slows or<br>
halts the generation of neurofibrillary tangles and thus treat or reduce the severity of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
[0015] Evidence for the role GSK-3 plays in Alzheimer's disease has been shown in vitro. See Aplin et al (1996), J Neurochem 67:699; Sun et al (2002), Neurosci Lett 321:61 (GSK3b phosphorylates cytoplasmic domain of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and GSK3b inhibition reduces Ab40 &amp; Ab42 secretion in APP-transfected cells); Takashima et al (1998), PNAS 95:9637; Kirschenbaum et al (2001), J Biol Chem 276:7366 (GSK3b complexes with and phosphorylates presenilin-1, which is associated with gamma-secretase activity in the synthesis of AP from APP); Takashima et al (1998), Neurosci Res 31:317 (Activation of GSK3b by Ab(25-35) enhances phosphorylation of tau in hippocampal neurons. This observation provides a link between Ab and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, another pathological hallmark of AD); Takashima et al (1993), PNAS 90:7789 (Blockade of GSK3b expression or activity prevents Ab-induced neuro-degeneration of cortical and hippocampal primary cultures); Suhara et al (2003), Neurobiol Aging. 24:437 (Intracellular Ab42 is toxic to endothelial cells by interfering with activation of Akt/GSK-3b signaling-dependent mechanism); De Ferrari et al (2003) Mol Psychiatry 8:195 (Lithium protects N2A cells &amp; primary hippocampal neurons from Ab fibrils-induced cytotoxicity, &amp; reduced nuclear translocation/destabilization of b-catenin); and Pigino et al., J Neurosci, 23:4499, 2003 (The mutations in Alzheimer's presenilin 1 may deregulate and increase GSK-3 activity, which in turn, impairs axonal transport in neurons. The consequent reductions in axonal transport in affected neurons can ultimately lead to neurodegeneration).<br>
[0016] Evidence for the role GSK-3 plays in Alzheimer's disease has been shown in vivo. See Yamaguchi et al (1996), Acta Neuropathol 92:232; Pei et al (1999), J Neuropath Exp Neurol 58:1010 (GSK3b immunoreactivity is elevated in susceptible regions of AD brains); Hernandez el al (2002), J Neurochem 83:1529 (Transgenic mice with conditional GSK3b overexpression exhibit cognitive deficits similar to those in transgenic APP mouse models of AD); De Ferrari et al (2003) Mol Psychiatry 8:195 (Chronic lithium treatment rescued neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments (Morris water maze) caused by intrahippocampal injection of Ab fibrils.); McLaurin et al., Nature Med, 8:1263, 2002 (Immunization with Ab in a transgenic model of AD<br>
reduces both AD-like neuropathology and the spatial memory impairments); and phlel et al (2003) Nature 423:435 (GSK3 regulates amyloid-beta peptide production via direct inhibition of gamma secretase in AD tg mice).<br>
[0017] Presenilin-1 and kinesin-1 are also substrates for GSK-3 and relate to another mechanism for the role GSK-3 plays in Alzheimer's disease, as was recently described by Pigino, G., et al., Journal of Neuroscience (23:4499, 2003). It was found that GSK3beta phosphorylates kinsesin-I light chain, which results in a release of kinesin-1 from membrane-bound organelles, leading to a reduction in fast anterograde axonal transport (Morfini et al., 2002). The authors suggest that the mutations in PS1 may deregulate and increase GSK-3 activity, which in turn, impairs axonal transport in neurons. The consequent reductions in axonal transport in affected neurons ultimately leads to neurodegeneration.<br>
[0018] GSK-3 is also associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). See Williamson and Cleveland, 1999 (Axonal transport is retarded in a very early phase of ALS in mSODl mice); Morfini et al., 2002 (GSK3 phosphorylates kinesin light chains and inhibit anterograde axonal transport); Warita et al., Apoptosis, 6:345,2001 (The majority of spinal motor neurons lost the immunoreactivities for both PI3-K and Akt in the early and presymptomatic stage that preceded significant loss of the neurons in this SOD1 tg animal model of ALS); and Sanchez et al., 2001 (The inhibition of PI-3K induces neurite retraction mediated by GSK3 activation).<br>
[0019] GSK-3 activity is also linked to spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries. It has been shown that GSK3 inhibition by lithium and valproic acid can induce axonal remodeling and change synaptic connectivity. See Kaytor &amp; Orr, Curr Opin Neurobiol, 12:275, 2002 (Downregulation of GSK3 causes changes in mirotubule-associated proteins: tau, MAPI &amp; 2) and Hall et al., Mol Cell Neurosci, 20:257, 2002 (Lithium and valproic acid induces the formation of growth cone-like structures along the axons). See also Grothe et al., Brain Res, 885:172,2000 (FGF2 stimulate Schwann cell proliferation and inhibit myelination during axonal growth); Grothe and Nikkhah, 2001 (FGF-2 is up regulated in the proximal and distal nerve stumps within 5 hours after nerve crush); and Sanchez et al., 2001 (The inhibition of PI-3K induces neurite retraction mediated by GSK3 activation).<br>
[0020] Another substrate of GSK-3 is P-catenin, which is degraded after phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced levels of P-catenin have been reported in schizophrenic patients and have also been associated with other diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death [Zhong et al., Nature, 395, 698-702 (1998); Takashima et al., PNAS, 90,7789-93 (1993); Pei et al., /. Neuropathol. Exp, 56,70-78 (1997); and Smith et al., Bio-org. Med. Chem. 11, 635-639 (2001)]. Furthermore, p-catenin and Tcf-4 play a dual role in vascular remodeling by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and promoting proliferation (Wang et al., Circ Res, 90:340, 2002). Accordingly, GSK-3 is associated with angiogenic disorders. See also Liu et al., FASEB J, 16:950, 2002 (Activation of GSK3 reduces hepatocyte growth factor, leading to altered endothelial cell barrier function and diminished vascular integrity) and Kim et al.,k J Biol Chem, 277:41888, 2002 (GSK3beta activation inhibits angiogenesis in vivo using Matrigel plug assay: the inhibition of GSK3beta signaling enhances capillary formation). [0021] Association between GSK-3 and Huntington's disease has been shown. See Carmichael et al., J Biol Chem., 277:33791, 2002 (GSK3beta inhibition protect cells from poly-glutamine-induced neuronal and non-neuronal cell death via increases in b-catenin and its associated transcriptional pathway). Overexpression of GSK3 reduced the activation of heat shock transcription factor-1 and heat shock protein HSP70 (Bijur et al., J Biol Chem, 275:7583, 2000) that are shown to decrease both poly-(Q) aggregates and cell death in in vitro HD model (Wyttenbach eta 1., Hum Mol Genet, 11:1137, 2002). [0022] GSK-3 effects the levels of FGF-2 and their receptors are increased during remyelination of brain aggregate cultures remyelinating rat brains. See Copelman et al., 2000, Messersmith, et al., 2000; and Hinks and Franklin, 2000. It was also found that FGF-2 induces process outgrowth by oligodendrocytes implicating involvement of FGF in remyelination (Oh and Yong, 1996; Gogate et al., 1994) and that FGF-2 gene therapy has shown to improve the recovery of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice (Ruffini, et al., 2001).<br>
[0023] GSK-3 has also been associated with hair growth because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is shown to play a major role in hair follicle morphogenesis and differentiation (Kishimotot et al. Genes Dev, 14:1181, 2000; Millar, J Invest Dermatol, 118:216, 2002). It was found that mice with constitutive overexpression of the inhibitors of Wnt signaling in skin failed to develop hair follicles. Wnt signals are required for the initial<br>
development of hair follicles and GSK3 constitutively regulates Wnt pathways by inhibiting beta-catenin. (Andl et al., Dev Cell 2:643, 2002). A transient Wnt signal provides the crucial initial stimulus for the start of a new hair growth cycle, by activating beta-catenin and TCF-regulated gene transcription in epithelial hair follicle precursors (Van Mater et al., Genes Dev, 17:1219,2003)<br>
[0024] Because GSK-3 activity is associated with sperm motility, GSK-3 inhibition is useful as a male contraceptive. It was shown that a decline in sperm GSK3 activity is associated with sperm motility development in bovine and monkey epididymis (Vijayaraghavan et al., Biol Reprod, 54: 709,1996; Smith et al., J Androl, 20:47,1999). Furthermore, tyrosine &amp; serine/threonine phosphorylation of GSK3 is high in motile compared to immotile sperm in bulls (Vijayaraghavan et al., Biol Reprod, 62:1647, 2000). This effect was also demonstrated with human sperm (Luconi et al., Human Reprod, 16:1931,2001).<br>
[0025] Considering the lack of currently available treatment options for the majority of the conditions associated with GSK-3 protein kinase, there is still a great need for new therapeutic agents that inhibit this protein target.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0031] The present invention provides a compound of formula I:<br><br>
I<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:<br>
W is nitrogen or CH;<br>
R1 is selected from hydrogen or fluorine; and<br>
Ry is a C1-4 aliphatic group, optionally substituted with N(R2)2 or a 5-6 membered<br>
saturated ring having 1-2 heteroatoms independently selected, from nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
or sulfur, wherein:<br>
each R2 is independently selected from hydrogen or a C1-3 aliphatic group optionally substituted with OH, N(R3)2, or a 5-6 membered saturated ring having 1-2 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur; and wherein:<br>
each R3 is independently selected from hydrogen or a C1-3 aliphatic group; provided that:<br>
when R1 is hydrogen and W is CH, then Ry is other than methyl.<br>
[0032] The term "aliphatic" or "aliphatic group" as used herein means a straight-chain or branched C1-C4 hydrocarbon chain that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, or a monocyclic C3-C4 hydrocarbon that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic (also referred to herein as "carbocycle" or "cycloalkyl"), that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule. For example, suitable aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, linear or branched or alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl groups and hybrids thereof such as (cycloalkyl)alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkenyl. [0033] The terms "alkyl", "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" used alone or as part of a larger moiety shall include both straight and branched chains containing one to four: carbon atoms and at least two carbon atoms and one double bond in the case of alkenyl and at least two carbon atoms and one triple bond, in the case of alkynyl. [0034] The compounds utilized in this invention are limited to those that are chemically feasible and stable. Therefore, a combination of substituents or variables in the compounds described above is permissible only if such a combination results in a stable or chemically feasible compound.

effect of test compounds is evaluated against ischemic-induced neuronal cell injury and<br>
cell death.<br>
[00103] The following steps were performed prior to the day of the assay:<br>
[00104] The LoG-Neurobasal [LoG-Neurobasal contains NoG-Neurobasal medium<br>
(Invitrogen Corp, customized order) plus 0.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM L-glutamine and<br>
0.25x Penicillin/Streptomycin] was pre-equilibrated in the hypoxic chamber overnight.<br>
[00105] The LoG-Neurobasal was pre-equilibrated in the normal incubator (5% CO2)<br>
overnight.<br>
[00106] In the normal incubator (5% CO2), Neurobasal/B27AO [Neurobasal/B27AO<br>
contains Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen Corp Cat # 21103-049) with 2x B27 minus AO<br>
supplement (Invitrogen Corp Cat #10889-038), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 0.25x<br>
Penicillin/Streptomycin] was pre-equilibrated overnight.<br>
[00107] The following steps were performed the day of the assay:<br>
[00108] LoG-Neurobasal medium was removed from the hypoxic chamber, and the<br>
medium was lightly bubbled with 100% N2 for 30 minutes to deoxygenate completely.<br>
[00109] The Neurobasal/B27m culture medium [Neurobasal/B27m contains<br>
Neurobasal medium with 2x B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corp Cat #17504-044) and 0.5<br>
mM L-glutamine] was aspirated from the cells in each 12-well plate using the vacuum<br>
pump with a sterile glass pastuer pipette attached.<br>
[00110] The plate was washed once with 2 ml of glucose free-BSS0 (pH 7.4), prepared<br>
from the following: 143.6 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KC1,1.8 mM CaCI2,0.8 mM MgSO4,1<br>
mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3,10 mg/1 phenol red, and 0.25x P/S.<br>
[00111] The neurons (10-11 days from initial culture) were replenished with<br>
deoxygenated LoG-Neurobasal (1 ml per well for each well of a 12-well plate). These<br>
neuronal cells were prepared according to Park LC, Calingasan NY, Uchida K, Zhang H,<br>
Gibson GE. (2000) "Metabolic impairment elicits brain cell type-selective changes in<br>
oxidative stress and cell death in culture. "J Neurochem 74(1):114-124.<br>
[00112] The test compounds were added directly to each well (3 concentrations of the<br>
compound plus positive control, each in triplicate). The compounds were dissolved in<br>
100% DMSO, where the concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.5% then the plates<br>
were placed in the Hypoxic Chamber for 5 hours with the plate lids ajar.<br>
enecavenencess or me occiuaer to block the lumen ot the artery, they were coated with a 1% Poly-L-lysine suspension and dried for 1 hour in an oven set at 60° C. Sutures were purchased from Ethelon, Somerville, NJ. Chemical reagents were utilized as follows:<br>
1. 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, or TTC, Cat #T8877, Lot #5OK1435, and PEG400, Cat# P-3265, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri.<br>
2. The phosphate buffered formalin, Cat # 245-685, was purchased from Fisher Scientific Co., Middletown, VA.<br>
3. The distilled water was produced in-house.<br>
4. The ethanol, Cat # E702-3, was purchased from Aldridge, Milwaukee, WI.<br>
[00121] The intraluminal suture model of focal cerebral ischemia was used<br>
substantially as described by Longa, et al., Stroke, 20:84-91 (1989). The left external<br>
jugular vein was cannulated for vehicle or compound administration.<br>
[00122] To help the rats maintain hydration during the study, 5% dextrose in water<br>
and lactated ringers solution (5 ml each) were injected subcutaneously in each flank at 10,<br>
24, and 48 hours after MCAO.<br>
[00123] Rats that met the initial inclusion criteria (neurological score of 2 and body<br>
temperature &gt;38.5° C) were randomized by sequential assignment to the vehicle or<br>
compound treatment groups. The initial daily assignment of the rats to a particular group<br>
was alternated each day.<br>
[00124] Treatment with compound or vehicle was initiated by bolus injection i.v. 6<br>
hours after MCAO and continued for the next 18 hours by constant infusion using the<br>
Infu Disk pump. The rats were anesthetized briefly and the jugular catheter was exposed<br>
through the dorsal neck incision. The bolus dose of compound or vehicle was<br>
administered and the infusion pump was activated 5 minutes later. The infusion pumps<br>
were attached to the back of the rats by a jacket.<br>
[00125] Compound solutions were prepared fresh daily using a vehicle of<br>
water:PEG400:ethanol in the volume 5:4:]. The groups and the doses utilized in this<br>
model are set forth in Table 2 below.<br>
* Bolus Dose Volume of 0.49 mL<br>
** Infusion Rate of 0.21 mL/hr and Infusion Duration of 18 hours.<br>
[00126] The volume of infarction was determined by image analysis of 7 consecutive 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) stained sections using a modification of the procedure described by Bederson et al. (1986). Three days after MCAO, the rats were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and decapitated. The brains were quickly removed from the calvarium and placed in individual beakers containing PBS in an ice bath for 30 minutes. Coronal brain sections, 2 mm thick, were obtained using a brain matrix sheer. The brain sections were placed in labeled petri dishes containing 2% TTC in PBS for 20 minutes at 37 ° C. TTC stains viable brain tissue red, leaving the ischemic area white. Brain sections were then immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 hours at 4° C. All the sections were imaged within 3 days of sacrifice. [00127] Formalin fixed TTC stained brain sections (7 consecutive sections) were captured digitally using Adobe Photoshop software and a digital camera. The images were imported into IPLab image analysis program. The area of cortical infarction (white area) was outlined and measured. The infarct volume was calculated using the following formula:<br>
Infarct volume = X infarct area X 2 (the distance between each section)<br>
The total ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric volumes were determined similarly. The volume of edema was calculated by subtracting the contralateral hemispheric volume from the ipsilateral hemispheric volume. A scientist blinded to the treatment of the rats performed the analysis.<br>
[00128] The neurological function of the rats was evaluated at 2, 24, 48 and 72 hours after MCAO using a scoring system described by Bederson et al. (1986b). The score ranged from 0 to 3 with 0 as normal and 3 indicates severe deficit.<br>
[00129] The neurological score at 2 hours of ischemia was used as inclusion criteria into the study. If the rat did not have a neurological score of at least 2 or if he had a score of 3, he was eliminated from the study. A researcher, blinded to the treatment group of the rat, performed the neurological evaluations.<br>
[00130] Blood samples (-0.5 mL) were obtained from the rats for pharmacokinetic analysis at 5 minutes and at 4,22,46 and 70 hours after the bolus injection. The rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane. Blood was collected in heparinized blood collection tubes (0.6 mL capacity) from a lateral tail vein using a 23-gauge butterfly infusion set. The blood samples were spun for 4 minutes (setting 10) in a microfuge. The plasma was removed, placed in labeled vials and stored at -20° C in a freezer. [00131] Seventy-two hours after MCAO, the rats were deeply anesthetized by CO2 inhalation and as much blood as possible was obtained by cardiac puncture. The blood was put into heparinzed blood collection tubes (6 ml capacity). Plasma was separated from the blood by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes (Allegra R6,). The plasma was collected, placed in labeled plastic tubes and stored at -20° C in a freezer. [00132] Statistical analysis for the infarct size, plasma glucose, body temperature, and body weight between the vehicle and treatment groups was performed by two tailed Student's t-test. The statistical analysis of the neurological score was done by non-parametric analysis. The data are presented as mean ± SEM.<br>
[00133] Treatment with a compound of formula I, administered 6 hours after MCAO, was very effective in reducing infarct volume this model of transient focal stroke (Figure 1). Rats in the compound treated group (88 ±31 mm3) had a highly significant 79% reduction in total infarct volume as compare to vehicle control (418 ± 31 mm3, p
[00134] Rats treated with a compound of formula I demonstrated marked improvement in neurological function over the time course of the experiment (Figure 2).<br>
As early as 18 hours after the initiation of dosing, a significant improvement in neurological function was observed in the compound treated group as compare to the vehicle control group (1.3 ± 0.3 vs. 2 ± 0 units, respectively, p

Animal Model for Anti-Depressant Agent<br>
[00135] Compounds of the present invention were assayed for anti-depressant activity in rats by methods substantially similar to those described by Porsolt, R.D., et al., 1977; 229: 327-336: Bourin M. Fundam Clin Phannacol 1990; 4: 49-64.<br>
Swim Test in Rats (Depression Test)<br>
[00136] Rats are placed in a transparent cylinder filled with water. The duration of immobility (=immobility-time), defined as that time during which the rat made only those minimal body-movements to keep its head over the water, is manually recorded. In a second trial, on day 4 rats are placed again into the cylinder, this time for 5 minutes. Immobility-time is manually recorded throughout the entire trial.<br>
Trial I (initial trial):<br>
[00137] On day 1 Male Wistar rats (RA239 strain; 160-180g) were placed for 15 minutes into a cylinder. The duration of immobility (=immobility-time), defined as that time during which the rat made only those minimal body-movements to keep its head over the water, is manually recorded. In order to test a reasonable number of animals within a day recordings are restricted to the following three sub-periods within the 15 min. trial: 0-2.5 min. (i.e. at the beginning of the trial), 6.25-8.75 minutes (exactly in the middle of the trial) and 12.5-15 minutes (at the very end of the trial). This procedure has been previously found to represent the animal's 'performance' as displayed throughout the entire trial.<br>
[00138] On day 4 rats are placed again into the cylinder, this time for 5 minutes.<br>
Immobility-time is manually recorded throughout the entire trial.<br>
[00139] Compound treatments were suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose (Methocel)<br>
and given orally (5ml/kg). Drug-administrations are in the evening (around 16:00) of day<br>
1 (the day of trial I), in the morning (around 08:00) and evening of days 2 and 3 and<br>
exactly lhour prior to trial II (on day 4). Treatments for the two rats within a diad were<br>
similar or different, depending on the randomization for the performance in trial I.<br>
Groups of rats treated with Methocel or 15mg/kg p.o. Despiramine (DMI) serve as<br>
control-group and positive standard, respectively.<br>
[00140] Compounds of the present invention were found to show anti-depressant<br>
activity in the above model.<br>

Animal Model of Schizophrenia: Pre-pulse Inhibition of Startle (PPI) [00141] Impairment of sensorimotor gating linked with disruptions in attention and cognition is common among schizophrenic patients. Pre-pulse inhibition of startle (PPI) is impaired in schizophrenic patients. Pre-pulse inhibition occurs when a weak sound preceding the loud acoustic stimulus inhibits the startle reflex. PPI is considered a test with good predictive, face and construct validity for schizophrenia. [00142] A positive control, clozapine, is a commercially-available atypical anti-psychotic drug (Clozaril®). Clozapine has a high affinity to D4 dopamine &amp; 5-HT2 receptors and effectively enhances PPI response in animal models. [00143] The PPI assay was performed, in the following manner, by methods substantially similar to that described by Spooren et al., Anxiolytic-like effects of the prototypical metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine in rodents. J Pharmacol Exp The. 295: 1267-1275 (2000). [00144] Male C57BL/6 (20-30g) were housed in groups of four in macrolon cages (42x26x15 cm) for at least 3 days before the experiment. The housing facility was temperature- and humidity-controlled and equipped with artificial illumination (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, lights on). The animals had access to water and food, ad libitum. All animals were experimentally naive.<br>
[00145] procedure animals were pretreated with test compound. (30,60,100 mg/kg), clozapine (30mg/kg), a positive control, or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose). After 45 minutes, mice were individually placed in the startle chamber with a background white noise of 70 dB, and left undisturbed for 10 minutes. Then there was a 15 minute session consisting of 56 trials. The startle stimulus is a 40 ms-120dB-white noise sound, pre-pulses are 20 ms- white noise sound of 72,74 and 78 dB preceding the startle by 100 ms. [00146] Eight types of trials were given: prepulse plus startle (7 trials per prepulse intensity), prepulse alone (7 trials per prepulse intensity), startle alone (7 trials), and no stimulation (7 trials). The variable intertrial interval averages 15 s (between 10 and 20 s). In the no-stimulation trials, baseline measurements were taken. In the startle alone trials, the basic auditory startle amplitude (g) was measured and in the prepulse plus startle trials, the amount of inhibition of normal startle was measured and expressed as percentage of the basic startle. In the prepulse alone trials, the normal response to a weak noise was measured as a control. Prepulse inhibition was computed according the formula, %PPI = 100-100 x [(PA2 PPP)/PA2]. Compounds of the present invention we found to enhance PPI of acoustic startle reflex in mice.<br>

Animal Models for Anxiolytic Agent<br>
[00147] The anxiolytic assay was performed, in the following manner, by methods substantially similar to that described by Spooren et al., Anxiolytic-Iike effects of the prototypical metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine in rodents. J Pharmacol Exp The. 295:1267-1275 (2000) and Lecci A, Borsini F, Volterra G and Meli A, Pharmacological validation of a novel animal model of anticipatory anxiety in mice. Psychophannacology 101: 255-261 (1990).<br>
Stress-Induced Hyperthermia:<br>
[00148] The test procedure for stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) was adopted with minor modification from the original description by Lecci, et al. (1990). Rectal temperature was measured to the nearest 0.1 °C by a thermometer (ELLAB instruments, Copenhagen, Denmark) via a lubricated thermistor probe (2-mm diameter) inserted 20<br>
nnn into the rectum while the mouse was hand-held near the base of the tail. The probe was left in place until steady readings were obtained (within 15 s). [00149] Fifteen animals were housed per macrolon cage (42 x 26 x 15 cm). At least 24 hours before the experiment animals within a cage were marked on their fur with color for later identification. Sixty minutes before taking the rectal temperature all individuals within a given cage were consecutively treated at 1-minute intervals with test compound (doses: 1.3,10 or 30 mg/kg, p.o.; injection volume: 10 ml/kg), chlordiazepoxide-HCl (10 mg/kg, p.o.; Research Biochemicals International), i.e., the positive controls, or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose; Animed). Exactly 30 minutes later the mice were consecutively removed from the cage (again at 1-minute intervals), and rectal temperature was determined and noted. Once temperature had been recorded, the animals were placed in a different (adjacent) cage. The dependent variable, i.e., the stress-induced hyperthermia, was defined as the delta of the median rectal temperature within the six initially removed mice and the median rectal temperature within the six last removed mice within a cage. This delta was calculated for six to eight cages depending on the specific treatment group whereas in the final representation the mean of these six to eight values was used. The rectal temperature of the very first animal was used, in addition, to evaluate the compound's potential effect on basal body temperature, per se<br>
II. Social Exploration Test in Rats:<br>
[00150] Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (= "resident" rats; 350-400 g) and young Lister Hooded rats (="intruder" rats; 100-120 g) were used. Intruder rats were housed in pairs and resident rats were individually housed in macrolon cages (42 x 26 x 15 cm) for 2 weeks before the test. All animals were housed in the same room. The housing facility was temperature- and humidity-controlled and equipped with artificial illumination (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, lights on). The animals had access to water and food, ad libitum. All rats were experimentally naive.<br>
[00151] Animals received test compound (doses: 0.3,3,10 or 30 mg/kg), . chlordiazepoxide-HCl (5 mg/kg, p.o.; CDZ, Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA), LiCl (10, 30 mg/kg) as the reference/positive compounds, or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose). The injection volume was 2 ml/kg. Oral treatment was given to the intruder rat only, and the test was performed 1 hour after compound administration. All<br>
observations were made during the light pnase (8.00) AM to 1:00 PM) in the home cage of the resident rat (see above). The floor of the cage was covered with sawdust. Pairs consisting of one intruder rat and one resident rat were assigned at random to one of the experimental or the control groups. The duration of active approach behaviors (=time spent in social activity) of the intruder rat (sniffing, anogenital exploration, nosing, grooming, licking, playing) toward the resident was manually scored and cumulatively recorded over a period of 5 minutes.<br>
HI. Elevated Plus Maze Test:<br>
[00152] Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (180-220 g) were housed in groups of four in macrolon cages (42 x 26 x 15 cm) for at least 3 days before the experiment.. The housing facility was temperature- and humidity-controlled and equipped with artificial illumination (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, lights on). The animals had access to water and food, ad libitum. All animals were experimentally naive.<br>
[00153] The elevated plus-maze consists of two open arms (40 x 12 cm) and two enclosed arms (40 x 12 x 20 cm), which all extend from a common central platform (12 x 12 cm). The configuration forms the shape of a plus sign., with similar arms arranged opposite to each another, and the apparatus is elevated 60 cm above the floor on a central pedestal. The maze is made from gray Plexiglas. The grip on the open arms is facilitated by inclusion of a small raised edge (0.25 cm) around their perimeter. [00154] The method was performed, in the following manner, by methods substantially similar to those described by Handley, S.L. and Mithani, S Effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in a maze exploration model of "fear"-motivated behaviour. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol 327:1-5 (1984). Rats were randomly allocated to one of the various treatments. Animals were transported from the housing room to the laboratory at least 1 hour before testing. After oral compound administration, rats were individually housed in macrolon cages (22 x 16 x 14 cm), and after 60 minutes placed onto the central platform facing an enclosed arm. An 8-minute trial was performed, and the maze was thoroughly cleaned between subjects. Direct registrations were made by an observer sitting close to the maze, and the following conventional parameters were used: number of open and closed arm entries (arm entry defined as all four paws entering an arm) and time spent on open arms (excluding the<br>
cenual pration . animals from the different treatment groups were alternatively tested,<br>
and trials were performed between 8:30 AM and 12:30 PM, i.e., within the first half of<br>
the light phase. The following anxiety reflecting parameters were recorded: ratio<br>
(open/total)time spent on open arms, latency to leave 1st arm, and total number of arm<br>
entries.<br>
[00155] Compounds of the present invention show an anxiolytic-like effect in the<br>
above animal models.<br>

Cell Assay for Alzheimer's Disease - Neuronal Survival<br>
[00156] The following assay is performed by methods substantially similar to that described by Kienlen-Campard, et al., JBiol Chem 277:15666 (2002). Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons are prepared from El8 rat embryos (Park et al., J Neurochem, 74:114, 2000). Cells are plated in 6- or 96-well culture dishes (4 x 105 cells/cm2) or glass coverslips (1.25 x 105 cells/cm2) pretreated with poly(D-Iysine) and cultured for 6 days in vitro in NEUROBASALTM medium supplemented with 2% B-27 and 0.5 mM L-glutamine prior to infection with recombinant adenoviruses. Under these conditions, neuronal cultures (up to 98% of neurons) display high differentiation and survival rates. [00157] Recombinant Adenoviruses and Neuronal Infection— Production, propagation, and purification of adenoviruses-encoding mutant form of APP695 are made. After 6 days in vitro, neuronal cultures are infected at the multiplicity of infection of 100 for 4 hours in a minimal volume of culture medium. Infection medium is then replaced by fresh culture medium for 3-5 days. Under these conditions, at least 75% of neurons express the proteins encoded by recombinant adenoviruses.<br>
[00158] Cell Survival Neuronal survival is measured by the eolorimetric MTT assay or CellTracker fluorescent cell viability assay using Cellomics automated imaging system. For nuclear staining, cells are fixed (0.37% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 30 minutes in the Hoechst 33342 dye (1 /mg/ml).<br>
[00159] Quantification of Abeta production — Culture medium is collected, treated with protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cleared by centrifugation (16,000 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).<br>
one nunarea ml or the supernatant is used tor beta amyloid quantification using the ELISA method described below.<br>
Example 24<br>
Inhibition of Beta Amyloid (1-40) Production<br>
[00160] Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques and intercellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The major protein component of these plaques is beta amyloid ("A(3") peptide which is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein ("APP").<br>
Cell line and compound treatment:<br>
[00161] A stable cell line capable of secretion of Ap was constructed in human H4 neuroglioma cells by transduction with a retroviral vector that expresses both A.PP695 containing the Swedish mutations (K595N, M596L) and YFP as a selection marker. Stable transductants expressing APP695 were selected by sorting cells expressing high levels of YFP.<br>
[00162] Cells were plated at 80,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen, catalog #11965-092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and pencillin/streptomycin. After 24 hours, the media was replaced with fresh media containing the compound of interest where compound concentrations ranging from 20 mM to 10 nM were tested in seven-point titrations in duplicate. After incubating with test compound for 18-24 hours at 37°C, the hAb (1-40) concentration in the supernatant was determined using the hAP40 ELISA.<br>
ELISA assay for secreted AP<br>
[00163] The Biosource International, Inc. Signal Select™ Human b Amyloid (hAP40) ELISA (catalog #KHB3482) was used for the in vitro quantitative determination of hAP40 in the culture supernatant of samples. A monoclonal antibody specific for the NH2 terminus of hAp was coated onto the wells of the microtiter plates. Samples, including standards of known hAb content, were pipetted into these wells followed by the addition of a rabbit antibody specific for the 1-40 sequence of hAp. Bound rabbit antibody was then detected by the use of a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. After removal of excess anti-rabbit antibody, a substrate solution was added.<br>
which was cleaved by the bound enzyme to produce color. The intensity of this colored produced is directly proportional to the concentration of hAb (1-40) present in the sample.<br>
The ELISA assay was performed as follows:<br>
[00164] Samples and standards containing a known concentration of hA|S (1-40) peptide were diluted in standard/sample diluent (Biosource reagent). The protease inhibitors AEBSF, Aprotinin, Bestatin, E-64, Leupeptin, and Pepstatin A (Calbiochem, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set m, catalog #539134) were added to all samples to prevent proteolysis of the APpeptides. 100 m.l of samples and standards were added to wells of the 96-well ELISA plates and incubated for either 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The wells were washed 4 times with 100 m1 of wash buffer (Biosource Reagent) then 100 m1 of detection antibody was then added and the plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The detection antibody recognizes the hAb (1-40) sequence.<br>
[00165] The wells were washed 4 times with 100 ml of wash buffer then 100 ml of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody was added. The plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The wells were then washed 5 times with 100 ml of wash buffer then 100 ml of stabilized chromogen was added. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The stabilized chromogen is a substrate solution which when cleaved by bound HRP turns blue and therefore can be monitored in a standard microtiter plate reader. 100 ml of stop solution was then added and the intensity of the color in the wells was measured at 450 nm using a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX 340 plate reader. Typically the compounds were analyzed in a 7-point dose response performed in duplicate with compound concentration ranges from 20 [xM to 10 nM. Concentrations of AP (1-40) in the samples were calculated from standard curves generated from standards that contained a known concentration of AP peptide.<br>
[00166] Compounds of the present invention were tested over a 3-day period.Each day, the Calbiochem gamma secretase "Inhibitor X" was included as a control. This is a cell-permeable hydroxyethylene dipeptide isostere with a reported IC50 of 50 nM (catalog #565771).<br>

AD trans genie animals<br>
[00167] Transgenic mice overexpressing the 695-amino acid isoform of human Alzheimer beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein containing a Lys670 --&gt; Asn, Met671 --&gt; Leu mutation (Tg2576 mice are commercially available from Taconic, N.Y.) had normal learning and memory in spatial reference and alternation tasks at 3 months of age but showed impairment by 9 to 10 months of age. A fivefold increase in Abeta(l-40) and a 14-fold increase in Abeta( 1-42/43) accompanied the appearance of these behavioral deficits. Numerous Abeta plaques that stained with Congo red dye are present in cortical and limbic structures of mice with elevated amounts of Abeta. The correlative appearance of behavioral, biochemical, and pathological abnormalities reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease in these transgenic mice suggests new opportunities for exploring the pathophysiology and neurobiology of this disease. See Correlative memory deficits, Abeta elevation, and amyloid plaques in transgenic mice. Science 1996 Oct 4;274(5284):99-102.<br>
[00168J Although Tg2576 mice are specified in the models described herein, it would be understood that other transgenic mice, available both commercially and privately, are amenable for use in said models.<br>

[00169] The Relationship between Ab and Memory in the Tg2576 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease. The Journal of Neuroscience, March 1, 2002, 22(5):1858-1867. [00170] Frozen hemibrains are sequentially extracted in a two-step extraction [sonication in (1) 2% SDS and (2) 70% formic acid (FA)]. The. latter fraction is designated Abnsol. After sonication the samples are centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4°C, the supernatant is recovered, and the pellet is sonicated with the next solution. Brain extracts are measured by sandwich ELISA as described previously (Suzuki et al., 1994; Gravina et al., 1995). The following systems are used: (1) BAN-50 capture and BA-27 or BC-05 detection or (2) 3160 capture and BA-27 or BC-05 detection, both of which detect A(5 1-40 and A(5 1-42, respectively. The direct<br>
comparison of many Tg2576 brains from mice of all ages showed that the amounts of A(340 and A(342 detected with 3160 capture ELISAs are essentially the same as when BAN-50 is used for capture. The 2% SDS extracts are diluted at least 1:40 so that the assay could be performed in 0.05% SDS. Greater dilutions are corrected for SDS so that they are also assayed in 0.05% SDS. The FA extract is neutralized by a 1:20 dilution into 1 M Tris phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The program Softmax is used to calculate femtomoles per milliliter by comparing the sample absorbance to the absorbance of known concentrations of synthetic A|3l-4O and A(3l-42 in identical solution as the samples, and these values are corrected with the wet weight of the original homogenate to be finally expressed as picomoles per gram wet weight. In all instances, nontransgenic tissues are processed identically in parallel with transgenic tissues.<br>
///. Behavioral Test of Transgenic Mice: Morris Water Maze<br>
[00171] The water maze is tailored to Tg2576 mice in the B6/SJL strain background in a manner that enabled us to detect and distinguish all stages of memory loss. This protocol provided the sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range needed to measure changes that are subtle early in life and gross late in life. Interpolation of probes during training provided sensitivity. Adoption of exclusion criteria for performance deficits gave specificity. Training extensively lent dynamic range. The assignment of mean probe scores (MPSs), which is the mean percentage time spent by a mouse in the target quadrant during the three probe trials, improved quantification of cognitive performance of individual mice for correlations with molecular markers and provided a single measure with a broad dynamic range. Protocols for Tg2576 mice in other strain backgrounds may need to be adjusted for strain-specific differences in rates of learning and performance deficits. See The Relationship between A|3 and Memory in the Tg2576 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease. the Journal of Neuroscience, March 1, 2002, 22(5):1858-1867. [00172] The water maze is a circular 1 or 1.2 m pool filled with water at 25-27°C and made opaque by the addition of nontoxic white paint. The pool is placed amid fixed spatial cues consisting of boldly patterned curtains and shelves containing distinct objects. Mice are placed in a beaker and gently lowered into the water facing the wall of the pool. Mice first underwent visible platform training for 3 consecutive days (eight trials per day), swimming to a raised platform (a square surface 12 x 12 cm2) marked with a black<br>
and white striped pole. Visible platform days are split into two training blocks of four trials for statistical analysis. During visible platform training, both the platform location (NE, SE, SW, or NW) and start position (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or NW, excluding the positions immediately adjacent to the platform) are varied pseudorandomly in each trial. Pseudorandomization ensured that all positions are sampled before a given position is repeated. Hidden-platform training is conducted over 9 consecutive days (four trials per day), wherein mice are allowed to search for a platform submerged 1.5 cm beneath the surface of the water. Mice failing to reach the platform within 60 sec are led to the platform with a metal escape scoop. During hidden-platform trials, the location of the platform remained constant (NE, SE, SW, or NW), and mice entered the pool in one of the seven pseudorandomly selected locations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or NW, excluding the position immediately adjacent to the platform). After each hidden platform trial, mice remained on the platform for 30 seconds and are removed from the platform and returned to their home cage with the escape scoop. Mice quickly learned to associate the scoop with escaping from the pool and consistently oriented to or followed the scoop on its appearance. The ability of mice to orient to or follow the escape scoop represented independent measures of vision and attention. At the beginning of the 4th, 7th, and 10th day of hidden platform training, a probe trial is conducted in which the platform is removed from the pool and mice are allowed to search for the platform for 60 seconds. All trials are monitored by a camera mounted directly above the pool and are recorded and analyzed using a computerized tracking system.<br>
[00173] The MPS is calculated for each mouse and used to assess retention of spatial information in the Morris water maze. By integrating information from the intercalated probes, the MPS represents a measurement of learning similar in concept to the previously described learning index (Gallagher et al., 1993), which samples memory at different stages of learning. Similar statistical results are found with MPS, the learning index and learning score (the weighted sum of percentage time spent in the target quadrant during probe trials), and we elected to represent our data using MPS because of ease of representation.<br>
[00174] After testing, a subset of each group of mice is euthanized, and the right hemibrain is frozen in liquid nitrogen for Ab measurements. All brains are analyzed in a coded manner.<br>
TV. Behavioral Test of Transgenic Mice: Exploratory Activity, Anxiety, and Motor Coordination<br>
[00175] See Transgenic mice expressing the betaAPP695SWE mutation: effects on exploratory activity, anxiety, and motor coordination. Brain Res 2003 Jul 4;,977(1):38-45.<br>
[00176] Spontaneous alternation is tested in a T-maze made of white acrylic. The maze consisted of a central stem (length: 30 cm) flanked on each side by two arms (length: 30 cm). The maze width is 9 cm and each wall is 20 cm in height. On the initial trial, the mice are placed in the stem of the T-maze with the right arm blocked by a plastic barrier (forced choice). After entering the available arm, the mice are kept in it for 60 seconds by closing the barrier behind them. The mice are then retrieved and after removing the barrier are immediately placed back in the stem for a free-choice trial, in which the mice could either explore the opposite arm or the same one (four-paw criterion). On the following 9 days, the same two-trial procedure is repeated, except that the blocked arm on the first trial is switched from right on odd days to left on even days. The number of alternations and the latencies before responding during the choice trial are measured, with a cut-off period of 1 minute per trial. If the mice had not responded within 1 minute and are far from the choice point, they are briefly prodded from behind, usually not more than once, so that a response could be recorded on every trial. [00177] Motor activity is measured in the open-field, made of white acrylic with a 50x50 cm.surface area and 38 cm high walls. The activity in the central and peripheral zones is recorded by an overhead video camera and analyzed. The central zone is square-shaped and began at a distance of 25 cm from each wall. The mice are placed in a comer of the open-field for three daily 5-minute sessions. The distance traveled and the time spent resting (5 cm/s) in each zone is measured, as well as time spent in the periphery and center of the apparatus. [00178] The elevated plus-maze consisted of four arms (length: 70 cm, width: 10 cm, height from floor: 40 cm) in a cross-shaped form and a central region (10 cm2). Two of the arms are enclosed on three sides by walls (height: 10 cm) while the other two are open, except for a minimal border (height: 0.5 cm), used to minimize falls. The two enclosed or open arms faced each other. The mice are placed in the central region and the<br>
number of entries and durations in enclosed and open arms are measured for two daily 5-minute sessions with the same video-track equipment used as in the previous test. The open/total arm entries and duration ratios are then calculated. On the rare occasions when the mice fell from an open arm, the recorded time is stopped and the mice placed back at the exact position it fell from. After each session of spontaneous alternation, open-field, and plus-maze testing, the apparatus is wiped clean with a wet cloth and dried before initiation of the next trial in order to reduce the possible effects of odor cues. [00179] The stationary beam is constructed of plastic, with a diameter of 2.5 cm and a length of 110 cm. The beam is covered by a layer of white masking tape in order to secure a firm grip and divided into 11 segments by line drawings. The beam is placed at a height of 45 cm from a mat-covered floor, which served to cushion falls and thereby prevent injury to the mice. A cardboard wall is inserted at the end of the beam to prevent the mice from escaping. A trial began by placing the mice on the middle segment. The number of segments crossed (four-paw criterion), the latencies before falling, and the number of falls are measured in a single four-trial session. The cut-off period is 1 minute per trial and the intertrial interval 15 minutes.<br>
[00180] The accelerating rotorod (Model 7650, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) is constructed of ribbed plastic (diameter: 3 cm). The beam is placed at a height of 13.5 cm from floor level and separated into five sections (width: 5.5 cm) by a plastic barrier. Facing away from the experimenter's view, the mice are placed on top of the already revolving rod (4 rpm) in the orientation opposite to its movement, so that falls could be avoided by forward locomotion. The rotorod accelerated gradually and smoothly from 4 to 40 rpm during each 5-minute trial. Latencies before falling are measured for three daily sessions of four trials, with an intertrial interval of 15 minutes. Whenever the mice clung to the rod without moving (passive rotation) for two complete revolutions in succession, it is considered to have fallen. Since no mouse appeared to jump deliberately, a valid estimation of motor skills could be obtained. After training, the occurrence of various normal and pathological reflexes is evaluated.<br>

[00182] Mice are cardiac-perfused with phosphate buffered saline (10 mM NaHPO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen brain sections are sectioned coronally at a l2-mn thickness using a cryostat, mounted on ProbeOn Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific), and air-dried. Immediately before staining, the brain sections are fixed with acetone. Tissue sections are incubated for 30 minutes in 0.3% H2O2 and 0.3% normal goat serum, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1.5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 minutes. Brain sections are then incubated with anti-A(5 antibody 6E10 (1:1000, Senetik) stained with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories), and immunodetected with Vectastain ABC Reagent (1:100, Vector Laboratories). Sections are counter-stained with hematoxylin.<br>
