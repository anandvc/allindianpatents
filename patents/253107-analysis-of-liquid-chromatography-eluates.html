TECHNICAL FIELD	<br>
This invention is in the field of analysis of saccharides.	<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Immunogens comprising capsular saccharide antigens conjugated to carrier proteins are well known<br>
in the art. Conjugation converts T-independent antigens into T-dependent antigens, thereby<br>
enhancing memory responses and allowing protective immunity to develop, and the prototype<br>
conjugate vaccine was for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) [e.g. see chapter 14 of ref. 1]. Since<br>
the Hib vaccine, conjugated saccharide vaccines for protecting against Neisseria meningitidis<br>
(meningococcus) and against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) have been developed.<br>
Other organisms where conjugate vaccines are of interest are Streptococcus agalactiae (group B<br>
streptococcus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Where saccharides are included in vaccines and other biological products then regulatory authorities<br>
generally require their characterisation. A common technique used for saccharide characterisation is<br>
anion chromatography, and in particular high performance anion exchange chromatography<br>
(HPAEC), usually with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) [2,3]. Suitable HPAEC-PAD systems<br>
are provided by Dionex™ Corporation (Sunnyvale, CA) e.g. the BioLC™ system. These systems can<br>
quantitatively analyse individual saccharides within mixtures without the need for derivatisation or<br>
pre-analysis separation, and analysis of mixed saccharides can be used in saccharide profiling.<br>
When analysing saccharides, the eluate from a HPAEC column is typically analysed using a pulsed<br>
amperometric detector (PAD) i.e. detection is based on electrical current. At suitable (high) pH,<br>
carbohydrates can be electrocatalytically oxidised at the surface of electrodes by applying a positive<br>
potential. The current generated is this way is proportional to the carbohydrate concentration,<br>
allowing detection and quantification of the carbohydrate by amperometry. Compared with simple<br>
amperometric detection, the PAD technique intersperses short pulses of a cleaning and regeneration<br>
potential with the standard detecting potential, thereby avoiding difficulties that arise when oxidation<br>
products of analytes foul the electrodes. As well as being used for HPAEC analysis, PAD is also<br>
used for analysing HP cation-exchange chromatography [4] and other HPLC separations.<br>
To obtain further analytical information, particularly when dealing with compounds that are not<br>
amperometrically active and with chemically-modified compounds, the inventors decided to analyse<br>
eluates by spectroscopic means. Unfortunately, the high pH used during HPAEC analysis of capsular<br>
saccharides means that hydroxide ions are present in the eluate, and the high absorbance of these ions<br>
(particularly in the ultraviolet region) meant that addition of spectroscopic analysis was not easy.<br>
j Hydroxide ions could be removed by using a micro-membrane chemical suppressor device, but this<br><br>
introduced new problems, as the acetate, typically used as a 'pushing agent for eluting capsular<br>
saccharides is converted by the suppressor into highly absorbent acetic acid. It is an object of the invention to provide further and improved methods and systems for performing<br>
anion chromatography characterisation of saccharides. In particular, it is an object to overcome the<br>
difficulties in spectroscopic analysis of eluates that arise from the presence of either hydroxide ions<br>
or, after conversion of hydroxide ions, acetic acid.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
To overcome these difficulties caused by using hydroxide/acetate-based eluents, the inventors used<br>
two approaches. First, they chose to use weaker anion exchange supports that do not require an<br>
acetate pushing agent. Such columns are not currently used for analysing carbohydrates, but are more<br>
typically used for resolving a large number of inorganic and organic acid anions [5]. Second, they<br>
chose to use pushing agents with low spectroscopic absorbance. Both of these approaches allowed<br>
spectroscopic detection to be combined with PAD detection. Moreover, they were also compatible<br>
With normal HPAEC-PAD protocols and they can advantageously be used even where spectroscopic<br>
detection is not desired, particularly as they permit better resolution of long oligosaccharides.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, therefore, amperometric detection is coupled with<br>
spectroscopic detection, such that both detection methods are used. Thus the invention provides a<br>
method for analysing the eluate from a liquid chromatography column, wherein the eluate is analysed<br>
by both amperometry and spectroscopy. The invention also provides an apparatus for analysing a<br>
sample, wherein the apparatus comprises (i) a liquid chromatography column, (ii) an amperometric detector and (iii) a spectroscopic detector, wherein the two detectors are arranged to receive eluate<br>
from the column.<br>
The separate use of PAD or UV detection for analysing the output of HPAEC columns has been<br>
reported [6], but the use of both amperometric and spectroscopic techniques for analysing the same<br>
eluate is new. The information content derivable from using both sorts of detection advantageously<br>
exceeds that derivable from either of the two detection methods alone e.g. as seen in Figure 1, some<br><br>
peaks give better dynamic range in UV than PAD, and some peaks are better in PAD than in UV.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention also provides a method for eluting a capsular saccharide analyte<br>
from an anion exchange chromatography column, wherein the analyte is eluted using an eluent<br>
comprising an anion other than an acetate or a hydroxide. The'eluent preferably comprises an anion<br>
selected from the group consisting of: a nitrate; a chloride; a carbonate; and a borate. Sodium salts of<br>
these anions can conveniently be used. This method is particularly useful when the eluent is basic<br>
(e.g. pH&gt;9), even more so if a chemical suppressor of hydroxide ions is being used, and provides<br>
better resolution of long oligosaccharides. Moreover, this method is particularly useful for analysis of<br>
acetylated saccharides.<br><br>
In a third aspect, the invention also provides a method for analysing a saccharide by anion exchange<br>
chromatography, wherein the chromatography is performed using a column that has a capacity of<br>
less than 50µeq {e.g. 
elution is rapid and pushing agents do not need to be used. Hydroxide suppression can thus be used<br>
without generating acetic acid. An acetate-free hydroxide eluent will typically be used, and the<br>
avoidance of acetate ions is particularly useful for analysis of acetylated saccharides. The low<br>
capacity columns allow better resolution of long oligosaccharides.<br>
The second and third aspects of the invention can advantageously be used together i.e. the invention<br>
provides a method for analysing a capsular saccharide analyte by anion exchange chromatography,<br>
wherein the chromatography is performed using a column that has a capacity of less than 50µeq, and<br>
wherein elution from the column uses an eluent comprising an ion selected from the group consisting<br>
of a nitrate and a chloride.<br>
The invention also provides the eluate of a chromatographic method of the invention. The invention<br>
further provides a pharmaceutical comprising as an active ingredient a substance that has been<br>
analysed using a method of the invention. In particular, the invention provides an immunogenic<br>
composition, such as a vaccine, comprising a bacterial capsular saccharide that has been analysed<br>
using a method of the invention.<br>
The liquid chromatography column<br>
The first aspect of the invention is useful for analysing the output from a liquid chromatography<br>
column. This aspect can be applied to various liquid chromatography columns, but it is preferably<br>
used with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The invention is particularly useful for<br>
analysing the results of separation by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC)<br>
or by high performance cation exchange chromatography (HPCEC).<br>
Preferred columns are those that spontaneously retain saccharides such that the saccharides have to<br>
be eluted from the column. Elution from the chromatography column can be an isocratic elution or a<br>
gradient elution. Eluents including sodium hydroxide and/or sodium acetate are typical eluents used<br>
during HPAEC-PAD analysis of saccharides. In the second aspect of the invention, however, nitrate<br>
and/or chloride salt eluents (typically sodium salts) are used, usually substantially in the absence of<br>
I<br>
any acetate eluent. For eluting analytes from anion exchange columns then the eluent will generally<br>
be basic e.g. the pH will be &gt;8, &gt;9, &gt;10, &gt;11, &gt;12, &gt;13, etc. Hydroxide salts {e.g. NaOH) can be used<br>
to achieve the desired pH, and hydroxide ions are typical for use in anion exchange eluents.<br>
Eluates may be subjected to chemical suppression of hydroxide ions, particularly where the ions<br>
interfere with an analytical detection technique that is being used. A micromembrane suppressor can conveniently be used, such as the MMS products from Dionex™. The 'MMS IIP product uses<br>
continuous chemical suppression to enhance analyte conductivities while decreasing eluent<br>
conductivity, and enables direct conductivity detection with ion-exchange applications using<br><br><br>
isocratic or gradient elution over wide concentration ranges. Suppressors that generate acetic acid<br>
from acetate ions are preferably avoided when acetate ions are included in the eluent and the<br>
generated acetic acid interferes with an analytical detection technique that is being used.<br>
preferred HPAEC columns for use with the first and second aspects of the invention are the<br>
"CarboPac" columns marketed by Dionex, such as the PA1 [10 urn diameter polystyrene substrate<br>
2% crosslinked with divinylbenzene, agglomerated with 500 nm MicroBead quaternary ammonium<br>
functionalized latex (5% crosslinked)], PA100, PA20, PA10 [10 µm diameter ethylvinylbenzene<br>
subsfrate 55% crosslinked with divinylbenzene, agglomerated with 460 nm MicroBead difunctional<br><br>
quaternary ammonium ion (5% crosslinked)], PA200 or MA1 columns. Preferred HPCEC columns<br>
are the "IonPac" columns also marketed by Dionex, including the CS10 column.<br>
As an alternative to using liquid chromatography, the first aspect of the invention can be used to<br>
analyse the output of a capillary electrophoresis separation e.g. the Beckman-Coulter P/ACE system.<br>
For the third aspect of the invention, the anion exchange column has an ion capacity of less than<br>
50µeq (milliequivalents of charge) e.g. 
the hydroxide-selective "IonPac AS" columns marketed by Dionex, such as the AS11 column, with<br>
alkanol quaternary ammonium functional groups. When used in its 2x250mm analytical format, the<br>
AS 11 column has a capacity of 11 µeq, which increases to 45µeq when used in a 4x250mm format.<br>
Low capacity hydroxide-selective columns are preferred.<br>
Amperometric and spectroscopic detection<br>
The first aspect of the invention analyses the eluate of a liquid chromatography column both<br>
arnperometrically and spectroscopically. Material eluting from a column can be split, with one<br>
portion being analysed arnperometrically and another portion being analysed spectroscopically. As<br>
an alternative, material eluting from a column can be analysed in series without splitting, either<br>
arnperometrically then spectroscopically or spectroscopically then arnperometrically. These two<br>
different general methods are illustrated in Figures 2 &amp; 3. Where serial analysis is used then it may<br>
be preferred to perform spectroscopic detection before amperometric detection, particularly if the<br>
spectroscopic detection is non-destructive relative to the amperometric detection.<br>
i<br>
The amperometric detection is preferably a pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). Various<br>
waveforms can be used in PAD [7], including any of those with the profiles shown in Figure 4. The<br>
use of a negative potential for cleaning the electrode is preferred. The Figure 4A waveform uses a<br>
negative potential for electrode cleaning, and both improves long term reproducibility and reduces<br>
electrode wear.<br>
The electrode used for the amperometric detection is preferably a gold electrode.<br>
The spectroscopic detection is preferably based on the absorption and/or emission of electromagnetic<br>
radiation, preferably with a wavelength between 100nm and 900nm {e.g. with a wavelength in the<br><br>
range 100-200nm, 150-250nm, '200-300nm, 250-350nm, 300-400nm, 350-450nm, 400-500nm,<br>
450-550nm, 500-600nm, 550-650nm, 600-700nm, 650-750nm, 700-800nm, 750-850nm,<br>
800-900nm). The wavelength of light used can be selected according to the analyte(s) to be detected.<br>
Ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy (e.g. at 200nm) and visible light absorption spectroscopy<br>
are two particularly preferred methods for analysing saccharides.<br>
As an alternative to using amperometric detection, the invention may use conductivity detection<br>
(including suppressed conductivity detection).<br>
Analytes<br>
The invention is used to analyse the eluate from a liquid chromatography column. The eluate will be<br>
the result of chromatographic separation of one or more analytes in a sample.<br>
The invention is particularly useful for analysing saccharide analytes. These may be polysaccharides<br>
(e.g. with a degree of polymerisation of at least 10, e.g. 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 or more), oligosaccharides<br>
(e.g. with a degree of polymerisation of from 2 to 10), or monosaccharides. Oligosaccharides and<br>
monosaccharides may be the result of depolymerisation and/or hydrolysis of a parent polysaccharide<br>
e.g. the analyte may be a saccharide-containing fragment of a larger saccharide.<br>
Preferred saccharide analytes are bacterial saccharides, and particularly bacterial capsular<br>
saccharides e.g. from Neisseria meningitidis (serogroups A, B, C, W135 or Y), Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, or 23F), Streptococcus agalactiae (types Ia, lb, II,<br>
III, IV, V, VI, VII, or VIII), Haemophilus influenzae (typeable strains: a, b, c, d, e or f),<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, etc. Other saccharide analytes include glucans<br>
(e.g. fungal glucans, such as those in Candida albicans), and fungal capsular saccharides e.g. from,<br>
the capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans.<br>
The N.meningitidis serogroup A capsule is a homopolymer of (αl-&gt;6)-linked N-acetyl-D-<br>
mannosamine-1-phosphate. The N.meningitidis serogroup B capsule is a homopolymer of (α 2—&gt;8)<br>
linked sialic acids. The N. meningitidis serogroup C capsular saccharide is a homopolymer of<br>
(α 2—&gt;9) linked sialic acid. The N.meningitidis serogroup W135 saccharide is a polymer consisting of<br>
sialic acid-galactose disaccharide units [-4)-D-Neup5Ac(7/90Ac)-α-(2-&gt;6)-D-Gal-α-(l—&gt;]. The<br>
N. meningitidis serogroup Y saccharide is similar to the serogroup W135 saccharide, except that the<br>
disaccharide repeating unit includes glucose instead of galactose [—»4)-D-Neup5Ac(7/90Ac)-α-<br>
(2—&gt;6)-D-Glc-α-(l—&gt;]. The H.influenzae type b capsular saccharide is a polymer of ribose, ribitol,<br>
and phosphate ['PRP', (poly-3-|3-D-ribose-(l, l)-D-ribitol-5-phosphate)].<br>
In addition to being useful for analysing full-length capsular saccharides, the invention can be used<br>
with oligosaccharide fragments of them.<br>
Other preferred saccharide antigens are those cleaved from glycoconjugates e.g. from<br>
saccharide-protein conjugate vaccine antigens. Of the three N.meningitidis serogroup C conjugated<br><br><br>
vaccines that have been approved for human use, Menjugate™ [8] and Meningitec™ are based on<br>
oligosaccharides, whereas NeisVac-C™ uses full-length polysaccharide.<br>
Other preferred saccharide antigens are eukaryotic saccharides e.g. fungal saccharides, plant<br>
saccharides, human saccharides (e.g. cancer antigens), etc.<br>
i<br>
t<br>
Saccharides that are charged (e.g. anionic) at neutral pH are preferred analytes. Saccharide analytes<br>
with multiple phosphate and/or multiple carboxylate groups can be analysed using the methods of the<br>
invention. The invention is thus particularly useful for analysing polyanionic saccharide analytes.<br>
Other preferred analytes are lipopolysaccharides and lipooligosaccharides.<br>
The invention is particularly useful for use with analytes that include various saccharides of different<br>
lengths e.g. different fragments of the same parent saccharide.<br>
The analyte will generally be in aqueous solution, and this solution will have a high pH and high salt<br>
concentration, as a result of HPAEC.<br>
Typical analytes are those that can be detected by both amperornetric and spectroscopic techniques.<br>
As well as containing analyte(s) of interest, samples to be analysed can include other materials.<br>
These may or may not be retained by the chromatography column, and so may or may not be present<br>
in the eluate. Typically such components will not bind to the column.<br>
Thus the eluates analysed by the methods of the invention will include these analytes or will be<br>
suspected of including them.<br>
The analyte may be a product to be tested prior to release (e.g. during manufacture or quality control<br>
testing), or may be a product to be tested after release (e.g. to assess stability, shelf-life, etc.).<br>
Further steps<br>
Prior to analysing the eluate from a liquid chromatography column, the method of the invention may<br>
involve adding an analyte-containing sample (or suspected of containing an analyte) to the column. Thus the invention provides a method for detecting the presence of an analyte in a sample,<br>
comprising the steps of: (a) applying the sample to a liquid chromatography column, such that<br>
analyte in the sample is retained by the column; (b) eluting the analyte from the column; and (c)<br>
analysing the eluate as described above.<br>
For saccharide analysis, it may be desired to filter at least some non-analyte compounds from the<br>
sample before entry to the column, and Dionex™ produce pre-column traps and guards for this<br>
purpose e.g. an amino trap for removing amino acids, a borate trap, etc.<br>
After elution and analysis, the invention may include the further step of determining a characteristic<br>
of a detected analyte e.g. its DP (typically an average DP), its molecular weight, its purity, etc.<br><br>
After the amperometric and spectroscopic detectors, the eluate may be coupled into a mass<br>
spectrometer e.g. FAB/MS or ESI/MS.<br>
Use of the invention to select desired saccharides<br>
The invention is particularly useful prior to conjugation at a stage where it is necessary to ensure that<br>
correctly-sized saccharide chains are selected for production of a conjugate.<br>
The invention allows the progress of fragmentation of a full-length polysaccharide prior to<br>
conjugation to be checked or monitored. Where oligosaccharides of a particular length (or range of<br>
lengths) are desired then it is important that fragmentation of the polysaccharide should not be so<br>
extensive as to take depolymerisation past the desired point (e.g. at the extreme, to give<br>
monosaccharides). The' invention allows the progress of this partial depolymerisation to be<br>
monitored, by measuring saccharide chain length over time. Thus the invention provides a process<br>
for analysing saccharide(s) in a composition, comprising the steps of: (a) starting depolymerisation of<br>
the saccharide(s) in the composition; and, at one or more time points thereafter, (b) analysing the<br>
saccharide(s) as described herein. In an initial run of experiments then it will be usual to analyse at<br>
several time points in order to determine progress over time, but after standard conditions have been<br>
established then it be usual to analyse at a set time point for confirmatory purposes. Once a desired<br>
end-point has been reached then the process may comprise the further step of: (c) stopping the<br>
depolymerisation, e.g. by washing, separating, cooling, etc. The process may also comprise the<br>
further step of conjugation of the depolymerised saccharide to a carrier protein, after optional .<br>
chemical activation.<br>
The invention also allows selection of desired oligosaccharide chains after fragmentation. Thus the<br>
invention provides a process for selecting saccharides for use in preparing a glycoconjugate,<br>
comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a composition comprising a mixture of different<br>
polysaccharide fragments; (b) separating the mixture into sub-mixtures; (c) analysing one or more<br>
sub-mixtures using a process as described herein; and (d) using the results of step (c) to select one or<br>
more sub-mixtures for use in conjugation. The process may involve fragmentation of the<br>
polysaccharide prior to step (a), or may start with an already-prepared mixture. The fragments may<br>
be fragments of the same polysaccharide e.g. of the same serogroup. After step (d), the process may comprise the step of conjugation to a carrier protein, after optional chemical activation.<br>
Prior to conjugation it is usual for a saccharide to be chemically activated in order to introduce a<br>
functional group that can react with the carrier. Conditions for saccharide activation can cause<br>
hydrolysis, and so it is useful to analyse a saccharide after activation. The term "saccharide" should,<br>
where appropriate, be taken to include these activated saccharides. Moreover, the invention provides<br>
a process for preparing an activated saccharide for use in preparing a glycoconjugate, comprising the<br>
steps of: (a) obtaining a saccharide; (b) chemically activating the saccharide to introduce a functional<br>
group that can react with a carrier protein; and.(c) analysing the product of step (b) as described<br>
herein. The process may include the further step of: (d) reacting the activated saccharide with the<br><br><br>
earner protein (which may itself have been activated) to give the glycoconjugate. The process may<br>
involve fragmentation of a polysaccharide prior to step (a), or may start with an already-prepared mixture.<br>
The invention can also be used after conjugation. After conjugation, compositions can be analysed<br>
using the invention in three ways: first, total saccharides in a composition can be measured e.g. prior<br>
to mixing of different conjugates, or prior to release of a vaccine (for regulatory or quality control<br>
purposes); second, free unconjugated saccharide in a composition can be measured e.g. to check for<br>
incomplete conjugation, or to follow conjugate hydrolysis by monitoring increasing free saccharide<br>
over time; third, conjugated saccharide in a composition can be measured, for the same reasons. The<br>
first and third ways require the saccharide to be released from the conjugate prior to analysis. To<br>
separately assess conjugated and unconjugated saccharides, they must be separated. Free<br>
{i.e. unconjugated) saccharide in an aqueous composition can be separated from conjugated<br>
saccharide in various ways. The conjugation reaction changes various chemical and physical<br>
parameters for the saccharide, and the differences can be exploited for separation. For example, size<br>
separation can be used to separate free and conjugated saccharide, as the conjugated material has a<br>
higher mass due to the carrier protein. Ultrafiltration is a preferred size separation method. As a<br>
further alternative, if conjugates have been adsorbed to an adjuvant then centrifugation will separate<br>
adsorbed conjugate (pellet) from free saccharide (supernatant) that desorbs after hydrolysis.<br>
The invention provides a method for analysing a glycoconjugate, comprising the steps of: (a) treating<br>
the glycoconjugate to release saccharide from carrier; and (b) analysing the released saccharide as<br>
described herein. The invention provides a method for analysing a glycoconjugate composition,<br>
comprising the steps of: (a) separating unconjugated saccharide in the composition from conjugated<br>

The degree of polymerisation (DP) of a saccharide is defined as the number of repeating units in that<br>
saccharide. For a homopolymer, the SP is thus the same as the number of monosaccharide units. For<br>
aj heteropolymer, however, the SP is the number of monosaccharide units in the whole chain divided<br>
by the number of monosaccharide units in the minimum repeating unit e.g. the DP of (Glc-Gal)10 is<br>
1,0 rather than 20, and the DP of (Glc-Gal-Neu)10 is 10 rather than 30.<br><br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Ultraviolet detection of HPAEC output<br>
The high pH used during HPAEC analysis of capsular saccharides means that hydroxide ions are<br>
present in the eluate, but these ions have high absorbance in the ultraviolet region. As shown in<br>
Figure 19, the use of a standard acetate/hydroxide eluent with just water on a CarboPac PA1 column<br>
gives an elution profile in the UV region that will obscure any analyte(s) of interest. In order to add<br>
UV detection to analysis, of HPAEC eluents, therefore, a different strategy was required.<br>
Combined PAD and UV analysis ofHPAEC eluent<br>
The capsular saccharide of serogroup A meningococcus was subjected to depolymerisation, to give a<br>
pool of charged (phosphate, from mannosamine-1-phosphate monomers) saccharides of mixed length<br>
(high DP). Rather than using a PA1 column for HPAEC separation, the mixture was separated on a<br>
Dionex IonPac ASH column with the manufacturer's suggested guard, using a sodium hydroxide gradient as the eluent (flow rate 1.0ml/min). The eluate from the HPAEC column was analysed in<br>
series by electrochemical (PAD, gold electrode) and UV detectors. The output from the integrated<br>
amperometric detection is shown in the top profile of Figure 1, and the output from the UV-visible<br>
detection (at 200nm) is in the bottom profile.<br>
The ASH column has a low capacity (11µeq). The same analyte was applied to a high capacity<br>
Dionex CarboPac PA1 column (100µeq), and sodium chloride was used as the pushing agent in the<br>
eluent. As shown in Figure 5, the eluent from the PA1 column could not be detected by PAD (bottom<br>
trace) but was detectable by UV (top trace). UV detection therefore allows low capacity AEC<br>
columns to be used for the analysis of capsular saccharides.<br>
Comparison of nitrate and acetate eluents<br>
A pool of oligosaccharide fragments of the capsular saccharide of serogroup W135 meningococcus<br>
was analysed by conventional HPAEC-PAD, using a CarboPac PA100 column with a gradient<br>
elution using sodium acetate with l00mM sodium hydroxide. The results are shown in Figure 7.<br>
For comparison purposes, the same analysis was performed but with sodium nitrate in the eluent in<br>
place of sodium acetate. As shown in Figure 8, the dynamic range of the output was far greater, and<br>
resolution of high DP fragments was better. DP50 fragments could be detected.<br>
Changing to a CarboPac PA1 column increased the dynamic range even further (Fig.9), and DP40<br>
fragments could be detected. With a 5µm PA200 column, DP80 fragments could be seen (Fig. 10).<br>
Nitrate salts are therefore useful for eluting capsular saccharides of different lengths from anion<br>
exchange columns.<br><br><br>
Nitrate eluent for DP detection over time<br>
The saccharide component of conjugate vaccines can be subject to gradual hydrolysis, and this leads<br>
to a reduction in DP over time and to a lower amount of saccharide bound to protein carrier. The<br>
depolymerisation of meningococcal serogroup A saccharides under different pH condition was<br>
monitored by HPAEC-PAD using a CarboPac PA1 column. The eluent was a mixture of sodium<br>
acetate and sodium nitrate in 100mM sodium hydroxide, with a l.Oml/min flow rate.<br>
Three different storage conditions were used: (1) pH ~9 at 37oC for 4 days; (2) pH ~4 at 37°C for 4<br>
days; and (3) pH ~7 at -20°C i. e. recommended storage conditions.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the addition of nitrate to the eluent allows PAD for the eluate, and low-DP<br>
fragments can be detected following depolymerisation. Short fragments are visible for the material<br>
stored at 37°C in positions where no peaks are seen for the material stored below zero (top line).<br>
H.influenzae analysis with low capacity column<br>
A pool of Hib oligosaccharides (DP 2 to 6) was analysed by conventional HPAEC-PAD on a<br>
CarboPac PA100 column. The eluent was a 30mM to 100mM sodium acetate gradient with 100mM<br>
NaOH, over 24 minutes at a 0.8ml/min flow rate. The results are in Figure 11.<br>
Only short chain oligomers eluted from the CarboPac PA-100, and elution required a high percentage<br>
of sodium acetate as a pushing agent. Even then, the DP5 and DP6 oligomers were poorly resolved .<br>
and with low sensitivity. The CarboPac PA-100 is thus not suitable for profiling of a pool of Hib<br>
oligosaccharides with DP&gt;4. Consequently a different chromatographic column was investigated.<br>
An IonPac ASH column was used to analyse a pool of hydrolysed Hib saccharide with an average<br>
DP of 12.44. This column has a high hydroxide selectivity, thus permitting elution of highly charged<br>
anions at lower hydroxide concentrations than previously used for strongly retained polyanions (e.g.<br>
the Hib fragments). The eluent was 3mM to 150mM NaOH over 15. minutes. The results are in<br>
Figure 12, again showing that low capacity columns can be used for analysing bacterial capsular<br>
saccharides. The elution was very fast and needed only a hydroxide gradient. All components from<br>
the Hib pool could be resolved in a chromatographic run lasting less than 10 minutes.<br>
Meningococcal serogroup A saccharide with low capacity column<br>
The IonPac AS11 column was used to analyse the molecular weight distribution of the serogroup A<br>
meningococcal capsular polysaccharide. Figure 13 shows a chromatogram obtained for a sample of<br>
the polysaccharide with a DP of ~200, using a hydroxide gradient of 10 to 150mM in 19 minutes.<br>
Surprisingly, the column was able to separate this high MW polyanion, and the column efficiency is<br>
so high that the analyte eluted in just 17 minutes in a relatively narrow peak. This result is much<br>
superior to methods such as gel permeation chromatography.<br><br>
The same column was used to profile the oligosaccharides obtained after acid hydrolysis of the<br>
polysaccharide. As shown in Figure 14, oligosaccharides of increasing DP could he resolved, with a<br>
correlation between DP and retention time on HPAEC-PAD.<br>
Meningococcal serogroup C saccharide with low capacity column<br>
i	■	. ■<br>
The serogroup C polysaccharide is a homopolymer of α-2,9-linked N-acetyi-neuraminic acids, which<br>
is partially O-acetylated. It is thus a polycarboxylate anion. The chromatographic pattern of the<br>
serogroup C saccharide is complicated by the presence of the O-acetyl groups, as each oligomer<br>
gives rise to a number of peaks depending on the distribution of acetyl groups in the structure.<br>
A purified DP5 standard was analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and was seen to contain<br>
a. distribution of multiple different oligomers (Figure 15). Analysis of the same standard by<br>
HPAEC-PAD on a CarboPac PA1 column is shown in Figure 16. Elution from the column required<br>
strong conditions (500mM sodium acetate, 100mM sodium hydroxide), and the differences between<br>
Figures 15 and 16 show that this acetate treatment alters the natural distribution of acetyl groups in<br>
the saccharide. The use of strong high capacity AEC columns for analysing acetylated saccharides is<br>
therefore not optimal.<br>
An IonPac AS11 column coupled with suppressed conductivity detection was therefore used instead.<br>
As shown in Figure 17, using a 10mM to 60mM sodium hydroxide gradient (no acetate) it was<br>
possible to elute the DP5 standard with a profile showing the different oligosaccharides and the<br>
distribution of O-acetyl groups. Interpretation of the chromatographic pattern is much simpler than<br>
for the MALDI-TOF pattern, which is complicated by the presence of different amounts of sodium as<br>
counter-ion which has a molecular weight equal to half the acetyl group weight.<br>
The elution pattern seen for the DP5 standard was also seen repeated at different lengths for the<br>
hydrolysis product of the capsular polysaccharide (Figure 18).<br>
It will be understood that the invention has been described by way of example only and<br>
modifications may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>

 (57) Abstract: When analysing saccharides by HPAEC, the eluate from the column is typically analysed using a amperometric<br>
 detector. According to the invention, amperometric detection is coupled with ultraviolet detection, with both methods being applied<br>
 to the eluate. Thus the invention provides a method for analysing the eluate from a liquid chromatography column, wherein the<br>
eluate is analysed by both (a) amperometric detection and (b) ultraviolet detection. The information content derivable from using<br>
 both sorts of detection advantageously exceeds that derivable from either of the two detection methods alone.</td>
