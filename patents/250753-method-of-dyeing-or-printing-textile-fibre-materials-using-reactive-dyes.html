Method of dyeing or printing textile fibre materials using reactive dves<br>
The present invention relates to a method of dyeing or printing textile fibre materials using reactive dyes.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention was to make available an easy to perform method of dyeing or printing textile fibre materials which results in dyeings or prints having a high depth of shade and very good fastness properties.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that when, for example, synthetic polyamkle ffcre materials are dyetf high depths of shade are obtained in conjunction with very good wet fastness and contact fastness properties when the fibre material is dyed using reacBve dyes in the presence of suitable salts which improve the uptake behaviour and the fibre material is treated with suitable nucleophiles in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The dyeings obtained solve the posed problem especially well. In particular, the dyeings obtained are distinguished by very good fastness properties, especially wet fastness properties, and by deep hues.<br>
The problem posed is solved in accordance with the invention by the method described hereinbelow.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a method of dyeing or printing texSe ftore materials, which comprises bringing the fibre material into contact with<br>
(a)	at least one reactive dye containing at least one anionic group,<br>
(b)	at least one compound which reduces the ionic character of the anionic 7019, and<br>
(c)	at least one nudeophific compound.<br>
Reactive dyes contain at least one fibre-reactive radical. Fibre-reactive radicals are to be understood in general as being those which are capable of reacting with the hydroxy groups of cellulose, with the amino, carboxy, hydroxy and thiol groups in wool and sifc, or with the amino and possibly carboxy groups of synthetic potyamides to form covatent chemical bonds. The fibre-reactive radicals are generally bonded to the dye radical directly or via a bridging member. Suitable fibre-reactive radicals are, for example, those containing at least<br><br>
one removable substltuent at an aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic radical or those wherein the mentioned radicals contain a radical suitable for reaction with the fibre material, for example a vinyl radical.<br>
Reactive dyes are known and are described in large numbers, for exampie in Venkataraman The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes" Volume 6, Academic Press, New York, London 1972.<br>
For the method according to the invention there is used, for example, at least one reactive dye of formula<br>
A-{Z)k	(1)<br>
wherein<br>
A is the radical of a monoazo, disazo, polyazo, metal complex azo, anthraquinone,<br>
phthalocyanine, formazan or dioxazine dye,<br>
Z independently denotes k fibre-reactive substituents, which may be identical or different<br>
from one another, selected from the group of the vinylsulfonyl, acryloyl and heterocyclic<br>
series, and<br>
kisa number 1,2 or 3.<br>
Fibre-reactive radicals Z from the group of the vinylsulfonyl series are, for example, aflc^ sulfonyl radicals substituted by a removable atom or by a removable group or altenyisulfonyl radicals which are unsubstituted or substituted by a removable atom or by a removable group. The mentioned alkyisulfonyl and alkenylsulfonyl radicals contain generafiy from 2 to 8, preferably from 2 to 4, and especially 2, carbon atoms.<br>
Fibre-reactive radicals Z from the group of the acryloyl series are, for exampie. akanoyl radicals substituted by a removable atom or by a removable group or alkenoyf radicals which are unsubstituted or substituted by a removable atom or by a removable group. The mentioned alkanoyl and alkenoyl radicals contain generally from 2 to 8, preferably 3 or 4, and especially 3V carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of fibre-reactive radicals Z from the group of the heterocycfic series include heterocycRc radicals that contain 4-, 5- or 6-membered rings and that are substituted by a<br><br>
removable atom or by a removable group. Suitable heterocyclic radicals are, for example, those that contain at least one removable substituent bonded to a heterocyclic radical, inter alia those that contain at least one reactive substituent bonded to a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring, for example to a monoazine, diazine, pyridine, pyrimkline, pyridazine, pyrazine, thiazine, oxazine or asymmetrical or symmetrical triazine ring, or to sue* a ring system that has one or more fused-on aromatic rings, for example a quinofine, phfoalazine, quinazoline, qumoxafine, acridine, phenazine or phenanthridine ring system.<br>
Removable atoms and removable groups or leaving groups are, for example, halogen, e.g. fluorine, chlorine or bromine, ammonium, including hydrazinium, sufeto, tWosuialc, phosphato, acetoxy, propionyloxy, azido, carboxypyridinium and rhodankto.<br>
As a radical from the group of the vinylsulfonyl series, Z is preferably a radical of formula -SO2-CH=CH2 or SO2-CH2-CH2-U wherein U is a leaving group.<br>
As a radical from the group of the acryloyl series, Z is preferably a radical of formula -CO-CH(Hal)-CH2(Hal) or -CO-C(Hal)=CH2 wherein Hal is chlorine or bromine.<br>
As a radical from the group of the heterocyclic series, Z is preferably a halotriazffie or halopyrimidine radical, especially a halotriazine radical, wherein the halogen is fluorine or<br>
chlorine.<br>

The fibre-reactive radicals Z and the dye radical A may be connected to one anofier by way of a bridging member. Suitable bridging members include, besides a direct bond or, for example, an amino group, a very wide variety of radicals. For example, the bridging member is an aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic radical; the bridging member may also be composed of various such radicals. The bridging member generally contains at feast one fcmctional group, for example the carbonyf group or the arnino group, it being possfcle for the amino group to be substituted by C1-C4aikyl which is unsubstftuted or further substituted by halogen, hydroxy, cyano, Ci^alkoxy, Ci-C4alkoxycarbonylf carboxy, sulfamoyf, sutfo or by sutfato. A<br><br>
suitable aliphatic radical is, for example, an alkylene radical having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, or a branched isomer thereof. The carbon chain of the alkylene radical may be interrupted by a hetero atom, for example an oxygen atom. A suitable aromatic radical is, for example, a phenylene radical which may be substituted by Ci«C4alkyl, e.g. methyl or ethyl, d-C4alkoxy, e.g. methoxy or ethoxy, halogen, e.g. fluorine, bromine or, especially, chlorine, carboxy or by sulfo, and a suitable heterocydic radical is, for example, a piperazine radical.<br>
Such fibre-reactive radicals Z are known per se and large numbers of them are descrtoed, for example in Venkataraman The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes" Volume 6, pages 1-2CS, Academic Press, New York, London 1972 or in EP-A-625 549 and US-Ar5 68413e.<br>
k preferably denotes a number 2 or 3, especially 2.<br>
When k denotes a number 2 or 3, preference is given to at least one of the fibre-reactive radicals Z being a radical from the group of the heterocydic series, for example a halotriazine radical.<br>

An aromatic amine is understood to be a compound wherein the nitrogen atom erf the amino group is directly bonded to an aromatic carbon atom. Accordingly, the term aliphatic amine is understood to refer to a compound wherein the nitrogen atom of the amino group is cfirectfy bonded to an afiphatic carbon atom. In the method accortfing to the invention, preference is<br><br>
given to the use of aliphatic amines as the nucieophiiic compound, especially those containing at least two amino groups.<br>
Preferred nucieophiiic compounds are the aliphatic diamines of formula (11).<br>
Especially preferred nucieophiiic compounds are compounds of formula (11) wherein B is a CrCi2alkylene radical, especially a CrCealkytene radical, which may be interrupted by 1, 2 or 3 -O- moieties and which is unsubstituted or substituted by hydroxy or by suKato. Of special importance are compounds of formula (11) wherein B is a (VCealkyiene radical which is unsubstituted and is not interrupted by -O-.<br>
Advantageously, (b) and (c), that is to say treatment of the textile fibre material with the saft and treatment of the textile fibre material with the nucieophiiic compound, are carried out one after the other.<br>
Treatment of the textile fibre material with the salt (b) is advantageously carried out by first dyeing the fibre material in customary manner and then adding the salt in suitable form, e.g. in the form of an aqueous solution, to the dye liquor during the dyeing process, for example after a dyeing period of from 10 to 60 minutes, especially from 10 to 30 minutes, followed, where appropriate, by a farther period of dyeing of, for example, from 10 to 60 minutes, especially from 20 to 50 minutes.<br>
(b) can also be carried out by treating, for example impregnating, the textile fibre material with the salt before the dyeing or printing process, it being unimportant which technique is used to introduce the salt into the fibre material; for example, spray or foam appBcafioru immersion or a pad can be used. Dyeing or printing with the reactive dye according to (a) can be carried out thereafter. It is then unnecessary to add further salt during the dyeing or printing process.<br>
Treatment of the textile fibre material with the nucieophiiic compound (c) can be carried out directly in the dye liquor by adding the nucieophiiic compound in suitable form, e.g. in the form of an aqueous solution, or preferably in a separate after-treatment bath. When carrying out (c) in a separate after-treatment bath, the dyed material is removed from the dye Hquor<br><br>
after the actual dyeing process and after the performance of (b) and, where appropriate, is rinsed again in suitable manner before being introduced into the after-treatment liquor.<br>
When (c) is carried out in a separate after-treatment bath, the treatment with the nucleophilic compound is performed at a temperature of, for example, from 30 to 100°C and especially from 50 to 80°C.<br>
The compounds which reduce the ionic character of the anionic group are advantageously used in an amount of, for example, from 0.1 to 100 % by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 50 % by weight and especially from 2 to 40 % by weight, based on the weight of the substrate, thai is to say the textile fibre material.<br>
The nucleophilic compound is advantageously used in an amount of, for example, from 0.001 to 2 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the weight of the dye liquor or on the weight of the after-treatment bath.<br>
The method according to the invention is suitable, for example, for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials. By way of example there may be mentioned silk, wool, cellulosic fibre materials of all kinds and polyurethanes and polyamide fibres. Cellulosic fibre materials are, for example, the natural cellutosic fibres, such as cotton, linen and hemp, and also cellulose and regenerated cellulose. The method according to the invention is also suitable for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-group-containing fibres present in blend fabrics, e.g. mixtures of cotton with polyester fibres or polyamide fibres. In a particular embodiment, the method according to the invention is not used for cellulosic or silk-containing fibre materials such as, for example, cellulose or silk.<br>
Preferably, the method according to the invention is suitable for dyeing or printing synthe&amp;c polyamide fibre materials, such as, for example, polyamide-6 (poly-e-caprolactamX polyamide-6.6 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide)), polyamkJe-7, polyamide-6.12 (pofy(hexamethytene dodecanoamide)), polyamide-11 or polyamkle-12, copoJyamkJes with polyamide-6.6 or potyamide-6, for example polymers of hexamethyienecfiarrune, E-caprolactam and adipic acid and polymers of adipic add, hexamethytenediamine and isophthalic acid or of acfiptc acid, hexamethyienediamine and 2-methyipentamethytene-<br><br>
diamine or 2-ethyltetramethylenediamine, and is also suitable for dyeing or printing blend fabrics or yarns of synthetic polyamide and wool.<br>
The method according to the invention is advantageously also suitable for dyeing or printing microfibres of synthetic pofyamides. Mtcrofibres are understood to be fibre materials that are composed of filaments having an individual filament fineness of less than 1 denier (1.1 dTex). Such microfibres are known and are usually produced by melt-spinning.<br>
In order to improve further the fastness properties of synthetic polyamides, especially microfibres, the dyeing process according to the invention can be followed by customary after-fixing or alkaline after-treatment.<br>
The mentioned textile material can be in a very wide variety of processing forms, such as, for example, in the form of fibres, yam, woven fabric, knitted fabric and in the form of carpets.<br>
In the case of carpet fabrics, printing methods such as, for example, displacement printing, or space dyeing are of importance.<br>
Preference is given to dyeing which is especially carried out in accordance with the exhaust method and, in the case of carpet dyeing, may also be carried out in accordance with the<br>
continuous method.<br>
Preference is given to dyeing at a pH of from 2 to 7, especially from 2.5 to 5.5, and very especially from 3 to 4.5. The liquor ratio can be selected within a wide range, e.g. from 13 to 1:50, preferably from 1:5 to 1:30. Preference is given to dyeing at a temperature of from 80 to 130°C, especially from 85 to 120°C.<br>
Dyeings and printings with good all-round fastness properties, such as, for example, good fastness to chlorine, rubbing, wetting, wet-rubbing, washing, water, sea-water and perspiration, are obtained. Contact fastness properties especially, such as, for example, fastness to water and perspiration, exhibit very good values.<br>
The Examples given hereinbetow are intended to illustrate the invention without Imiting the invention to the Examples specifically mentioned. The temperatures are given in degrees<br><br>
Celsius, parts are parts by weight and percentages refer to % by weight, unless otherwise specified. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume in the same ratio as kilograms to litres.<br>
Example 1: 70 g of a blend fabric consisting of 72 % polyamide microfibres and 28 % elastane are treated in a dyeing apparatus with 1.5 litres of liquor containing 3 g of formic acid, 0.4 g of wetting agent and 0.7 of a levelling agent, for 10 minutes at 40°C. The pH of the liquor is 2.9. 5.8 g of the dye of formula (1.5), previously dissolved in a smaB amount of water, are then added. The material to be dyed is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 min and is then heated to 100°C and dyed for 20 min at that temperature. 14 g of calcium chloride are then added and dyeing is continued for 40 min. After dyeing, the material is treated with 1.5 litres of an after-treatment bath containing 2 g of 1,6-hexamethytenediamioe for 20 minutes at 70°C. Rinsing and finishing are then carried out in customary manner. A deep, level dyeing having good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
In order to improve the fastness properties further, customary after-fixing or alkaline after-treatment may follow. For alkaline after-treatment, the dyeing is treated in a fresh bath, which contains 2 g/l of soda and has a pH of 9.2, for 20 minutes at 60°C. The depth of shade of the dyeing is approximately three times that of a comparison dyeing carried out analogously to Example 1 but omitting the treatment with CaCI2 and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine.<br>
Example 2: 70 g of a fabric of polyamide-6.6 microfibres are treated in a dyeing apparatus with 1.5 litres of liquor containing 3 g of formic acid, 0.4 g of wetting agent and 0.7 g of a levelling agent, for 10 min at 40°C. The pH of the liquor is 2.9. 6.6 g of the dye of formula (1.23), previously dissolved in a small amount of water, are then added. The material to be dyed is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 min and is then heated to 100°C and dyed for 20 min at that temperature. 14 g of calcium chloride, previously dissolved in 70 g of water, are then added and dyeing is continued for 40 min. After dyeing, the material is treated w* 1.5 litres of an after-treatment bath containing 2 g of 1,6-hexamethylenediamine for 20 minutes at 70°C. Rinsing and finishing are then carried out in customary mamer. A deep, level dyeing having excellent fastness properties is obtained. The depth of shade of the dyeing is approximately twice that of a comparison dyeing carried out analogously to Example 2 but omitting the treatment with CaCI2 and 1,6-hexamethytenedianwe.<br><br>
By proceeding as described in Example 1 but using, instead of 5.8 g of the dye of formula (1.5), the same amount of the dye of formula (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), (1.4), (1.6), (1.7), (1.8), (1.9), (1.10), (1.11), (1.12), (1.13), (1.14), (1.15), (1.16), (1.17), (1.18), (1.19), (1.20), (1.21) or (1.22), a deep, level dyeing having very good fastness properties is likewise obtained.<br><br><br>
