				<td>THERMOSETTING COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to thermosetting composition comprising, (a) 97.9 to 40 percent by weight of at least one bis(dihydrobenzoxazine) prepared by the reaction of an unsubstituted or substituted bisphenol with at least one unsubstituted position ortho to each hydroxyl group, formaldehyde and a primary amine; (b) 2 to 50 percent by weight of at least one organic polyamine; and (c) 0.1 to 10 percent by weight of at least one curing catalyst, selected from the group of carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and phosphonic acids having at least two acid groups and no other reactive groups. The invention also relates to the use of this composition for the manufacture of any materials with a cured resin of this thermosetting composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE'lNVENTION<br>
Benzoxazine compounds have been employed satisfactorily to produce prepregs, laminates, moulding material, RTM (resin transfer moulding) systems, sealants, sinter powders, cast articles, structural composites parts, varnishes, surface coatings, electrical and electronic components by impregnating, coating, laminating or moulding processes. Such resins are dimension stable and have good electrical and mechanical resistance, low shrinkage, low water absorption, medium to high glass transition temperatures and good retaining properties, in term of mechanical properties.<br>
Benzoxazine compounds can easily be produced in several, well known ways by the reaction of bisphenols with a primary amine and formaldehyde, whereby the process can be carried out in the presence of solvents (see for example US 5,152,993 or US 5,266,695) or in the absence of solvents (see for example US 5,543,516). The common manufacture and various curing possibilities using hardeners such as novolacs, polyepoxides or polyamines optionally together with catalysts, or the catalytical and/or thermal curing as well as the valuable properties of the resins make this class of thermosetting resins attractive.<br>
EP 0 149 987 A2 describes a thermosetting resin composition with improved storage stability comprising dihydrobenzoxazines of polyphenols and a reactive polyamine or polyamine generating   compound.   The  composition   is   used  for the  manufacture  of moulded,<br>
encapsulated articles or laminates, or of coatings. The composition is conveniently used as solution in organic solvents for surface coating applications. The solution with poly(dihydrobenzoxazines) and polyamines is stabilized by formation of an organic acid salt of the polyamines, whereby acids are selected from preferably volatile aliphatic mono carboxylic acids. The only disclosed purpose of an organic acid addition is the stabilization of the solution at about room temperature.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that organic poly acids are excellent curing catalysts for the polymerization of bis(dihydrobenzoxazine) compounds and organic polyamines, providing improved reactivity and correspondingly lower gel times at high temperatures. It was also found that a composition comprising bis(dihydrobenzoxazine) compounds, organic polyamines and an organic poly acid catalyst such as alkylene dicarboxylic acids possess an unusual high latency and storage stability regarding the increased reactivity. The admixed components can be stored in one container and shipped to users, which is a significant economic advantage and much more comfortable for users. Additionally, the processability and control during moulding operations, such as pressing, is improved by the reduction of flow due to the higher reactivity, thus resulting in improved dimensional accuracy. The cured polymers possess a high temperature stability due to their high glass transition temperatures, good mechanical and also good physical properties. Glass transition temperatures are even unexpectedly higher, when curing is carried out in the presence of organic poly acids. Depending on the selection of monomers, even a reduced combustibility can be achieved.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A first object of the invention is a thermosetting composition comprising,<br>
(a)	97.9 to 40 percent by weight of at least one bis(dihydrobenzoxazine) prepared by the reaction of an unsubstituted or substituted bisphenol with at least one unsubstituted position ortho to each hydroxyl group, formaldehyde and a primary amine;<br>
(b)	2 to 50 percent by weight of at least one organic polyamine; and<br>
(c)	0.1 to 10 percent by weight of at least one curing catalyst, selected from the group of carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and phosphonic acids having at least two acid groups and no other reactive groups;<br>
wherein the percent by weight refer to the total amount of components (a), (b) and (c) in the composition, with the proviso that (a), (b) and (c) add up to 100 percent by weight; and (d) and optionally other components.<br>
The term "no other reactive groups" means that only carboxylic, sulfonic or phosphonic acid groups are present in the acid and no other groups which would interfere with the polymerisation reaction. Examples for such interfering groups are hydroxyl, thiol, amine or amide. In the context of this invention, the term amine (in polyamine) encompasses reactive amines such as secondary or preferably primary amine groups.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment the composition according to the invention comprises<br>
(a)	96,5 to 50, preferably 96,5 to 60 and more preferably 96 to 70 percent by weight of at least one bis(dihydrobenzoxazine),<br>
(b)	3 to 42, preferably 3 to 34 and more preferably 3,5 to 25 percent by weight of at least one organic polyamine; and ,<br>
(c)	0.5 to 8, preferably 0.5 to 6 and more preferably 0,5 to 5 percent by weight of a curing catalyst, selected from the group of carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and phosphonic acids having at least two acid groups and no other reactive groups.<br>
It was found that cured resins with a lower content of aromatic polyamines possess higher glass transition temperatures and thermostability, respectively. Such thermosetting compositions in addition are highly reactive at elevated temperatures. Therefore, in another preferred embodiment, the composition according to the invention comprises<br>
(a)	97,9 to 80, preferably 97 to 83 and more preferably 96.5 to 85 percent by weight of at least one bis(dihydrobenzoxazine);<br>
(b)	2 to 15, preferably 2,5 to 12 and more preferably 3 to 10 percent by weight of at least one organic polyamine; and<br>
(c)	0.1 to 5 preferably 0.5 to 5 and more preferably 0.5 to 5 percent by weight of a curing catalyst, selected from the group of carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and phosphonic acids having at least two acid groups and no other reactive groups.<br>
The composition according to the invention is cured at high temperatures such as above 130 °C. Curing catalysts are useful to accelerate the curing process. These are preferably incorporated at low levels to avoid formation of volatile decomposition products which would<br>
effect the properties of the thermosetting plastics. In a very preferred embodiment, the amount of curing catalyst is 0.5 to 4 percent by weight.<br>
Preferred curing catalysts are aliphatic or aromatic polycarboxylic acids, polysulfonic acids and polyphosphonic acids, having 1 to 20, and preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms in the skeleton. The aliphatic and aromatic residues (the skeleton) linking the acid groups may contain hetero atoms and groups such as O, S, -N=, C=0, and -N(C1-C4alkyl). The aliphatic and aromatic residues may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more C1-C6alkoxy groups or halogen (F or CI).

pigments and dyestuffs;<br>
micro hollow spheres;<br>
metal powders;<br>
flame retardants;<br>
defoaming agents;<br>
slip agents;<br>
thixotropes;<br>
adhesion promoters; and<br>
mould release agents.<br>
The thermosetting composition according to the invention can also comprise a solvent or a solvent mixture, especially when it is used as laminating or surface coating composition. Examples of solvents that are particularly suitable include methylethylketone, acetone,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethyl formamide, pentanol, butanol, dioxolane, isopropanol, methoxy propanol, methoxy propanol acetate, dimethylformamide, glycols, glycol acetates and toluene, xylene. The ketones and the glycols are especially preferred. Typically, the laminating composition will contain 20 to 30 % by weight, preferably 30% by weight, of a solvent.<br>
The thermosetting composition according to the invention can be cured or pre-cured at temperatures of about 130 to 240 °C, preferably 150 to 220 °C and in particular 160 to 200 °C for the manufacture of prepregs, laminates or hot melting moulding processes.<br>
The thermosetting composition according to the invention can be used for example for the manufacture of composites from prepregs or B stage resins, and RTM (resin transfer moulding) systems.<br>
The thermosetting compositions according to the invention can be used for example as solvent-free casting resins, surface coating resins, laminating resins, moulding resins, potting resins, encapsulating resins and adhesives to produce moulded or coated articles or composites for the electrical and electronic, automotive and aerospace industry, or for surface protection of any articles, e.g. pipes and pipelines.<br>
Curing of the composition and an impregnation and lamination process is explained in the following:<br>
(1)	A benzoxazin-containing formulation is applied to or impregnated into a substrate by rolling, dipping, spraying, other known techniques and/or combinations thereof. The substrate is typically a woven or nonwoven fiber mat containing, for instance, glass fibers, carbon or mineral fibers or paper.<br>
(2)	The impregnated substrate is "B-staged" by heating at a temperature sufficient to evaporate solvent (if present) from the benzoxazin formulation and to partially cure the benzoxazin formulation, so that the impregnated substrate can be handled easily. The "B- staging" step is usually carried out at a temperature of from 80°C to 220 °C and for a time of from 1 minute to 15 minutes. The impregnated substrate that results from "B-staging" is called a "prepreg". The temperature is most commonly 100 °C for composites and 130 °C to 200°C for electrical laminates.<br>
(3)	One or more sheets of prepreg are stacked on top of each other; this can be in alternating layers with one or more sheets of a conductive material, such as copper foil, if an electrical laminate is desired.<br>
(4)	The laid-up-sheets are pressed at high temperature and pressure for a time sufficient to cure the resin and form a laminate. The temperature of this lamination step is usually between 100 °C and 240 °C, and is most often between 165 °C and 190 °C. The lamination step may also be carried out in two or more stages, such as a first stage between 100°C and 150 °C and a second stage at between 165 °C and 190 °C. The pressure is usually from 50 N/cm2 and 500 N/cm2. The lamination step is usually carried out for a time of from 1 minute to 200 minutes, and most often for 45 minutes to 90 minutes. The lamination step may optionally be carried out at higher temperatures for shorter times (such as in continuous lamination processes) or for longer times at lower temperatures (such as in low energy press processes).<br>
(5)	Optionally, the resulting laminate, for example, a copper-clad laminate, may be post-treated by heating for a time at high temperature and ambient pressure. The temperature of post-treatment is usually between 120 °C and 250 °C. The post-treatment time usually is between 30 minutes and 12 hours.<br>
Solid substrates for coating purposes may be selected from metal, metal alloys, wood, glass, minerals such as silicates, corundum or boron nitride, and plastics.<br>
The cured resins possess a high chemical resistance, corrosion resistance, mechanical resistance, durability, hardness, toughness, flexibility, temperature resistance or stability (high glass transition temperatures), reduced combustibility, adhesion to substrates and de-lamination resistance.<br>
Another object is the use of a thermosetting composition according to the invention for the manufacture of a moulded article, a surface coating, a composite and a laminate.<br>
A further object of the invention are cured products manufactured from the thermosetting composition according to the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples explain the invention.<br>
A) Preparation of thermosetting compositions<br>
Example A1:<br>
A solid mixture (parts by weight) of benzoxazine, aromatic diamine and adipic acid is molten at 130-140°C under thorough stirring. The gel time of such homogenous mixture is measured on a hot plate at 180°C. The mixture is cured in an oven at 200°C for 90 minutes. The results are given in Table 1.<br>
Bisphenol F benzoxazine corresponds to formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein X1 is -CH2-.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Example A2:<br>
Example A1 is repeated and 2,2'-dimethyl-4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexylmethane is used instead of 4,4'-diamino-diphenylsulfone. Curing is carried out additionally for 1 hour at 200°C and 2 hours at 220°C. The results are given in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Example A3:<br>
Example A1 is repeated and polyoxypropylene diamine (Jeffamine) is used instead of 4,4'-diamino-diphenylsulfone. The gel time of such homogenous mixture is measured on a hot plate at 170°C. Curing is carried out additionally for 1 hour at 200°C and 2 hours at 220°C. The results are given in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Remarks: The enhanced reaction (shorter gel time) rate, when adipic acidic is used as curing catalyst, results in a much shorter gel time. The cured samples show a very high glass transition temperature.<br>
