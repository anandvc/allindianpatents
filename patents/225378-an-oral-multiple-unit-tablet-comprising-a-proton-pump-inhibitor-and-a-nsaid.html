Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is related to new oral pharmaceutical preparations especially for use in the treatment and prophylaxis of gastrointestinal disorders associated with the use of Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). The present preparations comprise an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor in combination with one or more NSAID(s) in a new fixed unit dosage form, especially a tableted dosage form . Furthermore, the present invention refers to a method for the manufacture of such preparations and the use of such preparations in medicine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
NSAIDs including acetyl salicylic acid are among the most commonly prescribed and used drugs world- wide. Despite the therapeutic benefits of NSAIDs, their use is frequently limited by an increased risk of gastrointestinal side-effects, mainly upper gastrointestinal side-effects like peptic ulceration and dyspeptic symptoms.<br>
The relative risk of developing a gastric ulcer during NS AID treatment is increased by a factor 40-50, and the relative risk of developing a duodenal ulcer is increased by a factor 8-10 (McCarty DM. Gastroenterology 1989;96:662). The relative risk of developing an ulcer complication like bleeding and perforation of the stomach is increased by a factor 1.5-5 (Hawkey C. BMJ 1990;300:278). Further, dyspeptic symptoms are experienced in 30-60% of those on NSAID treatment (Larkai EN.AmJGas 1987;82:1153).<br>
In the UK, NSAIDs account for 25% of all reports of adverse drug reactions received by the authorities, and the corresponding figure is 21% in USA. Therefore, therapies which avoid gastrointestinal side-effect caused by NSAIDs is requested.<br><br>
Attempts to modify the NSAID structure in order to prevent such side-effects have so far been less successful. The most promising solution to the problem of healing and preventing NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal problems like ulcers and dyspeptic symptoms in patients with a need for continuous NSAID treatment is to combine the NSAID treatment with an anti-ulcer drug approved for the healing and/or prophylaxis of NSAID associated gastrointestinal side-effects such as prostaglandin analogues, H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors.<br>
Established risk factors for developing NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal side-effects and complications are for instance high age, previous peptic ulcer and/or bleeding, high dose of NSAID, co-therapy with steroids, and co-therapy with anticoagulants. This means, that for example fragile and elderly patients tolerating a complication like bleeding or perforation badly, should receive prophylactic treatment in connection with their NSAID treatment.<br>
NS ADDs are mainly used for the treatment of chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthtritis and osteoarthritis, which are most often seen in the elderly population. Compliance is especially important in elderly and fragile patients, who have the highest risk of developing a life-threatening complication to NSAID treatment like bleeding or perforation. It is known that 50% of all peptic ulcer deaths occur in NSAID users and that 68% of these are &gt;75 years old (Catford:Health Trends 1986;18:38). This is confirmed in another study concluding, that NS AID-related deaths occur primarily in those &gt; 75 years of age (Guess. J Clin Epidemiol 1988;41:35). The importance of compliance is further supported by the finding, that a majority of peptic ulcers associated with NSAID treatment are asymptomatic until the event<br>
Omeprazole being a well known proton pump inhibitor has been shown to be able to prevent gastric and duodenal erosions in healthy volunteers during treatment with acetyl salicylic acid. Clinical studies have shown, that omeprazole heals gastric as well as duodenal<br><br>
ulcers as fast and effectively in patients on continuous NSAID treatment as in non-NSAID users (Walan A. N Engl J Med 1989; 320:69). These results have been the basis for an amendment to the dose recommendation for the use of omeprazole in healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers during continuous NSAID treatment approved by regulatory authorities in UK and Sweden.<br>
Recent studies confirm, that omeprazole significantly reduces the risk of developing gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers and also dyspeptic symptoms in patients on continuous NSAID treatment.<br>
EP 0 426 479 describes tablet compositions comprising a NSAID such as ibuprofen and a gastric acid inhibiting drug, such as cimetidin etc. No specific arrangement is taken to avoid degradation if the gastric acid inhibitor is an acid susceptible compound, such as a proton pump inhibitor.<br>
In proposed therapies comprising NS AID(s) and an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor the different active substances are administred separately. It is well known that patient compliance is a main factor in receiving a good result in medical treatments. Therefore, administration of two or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two or more different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably a tablet<br>
Some anti-ulcer drugs such as proton pump inhibitors are susceptible to degradation/transformation in acid reacting and neutral media as mentioned above. In respect of the stability properties, it is obvious that the one of the active substances being a proton pump inhibitor must be protected from contact with acidic gastric juice by an enteric coating layer. There are different enteric coating layered preparations of proton pump inhibitors described in the prior art, see for example US-A 4,786,505 (AB Hassle) comprising omeprazole.<br><br>
There are problems to produce a fixed unit dosage form comprising a rather high amount of active substance. Active substances with different physical properties combined in the same preparation give further problems. Preparation of a multiple unit tableted dosage form arises specific problems when enteric coating layered pellets containing the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor are compressed into tablets. If the enteric coating layer does not withstand the compression of the pellets into a tablet, the susceptible active substance will be destroyed upon administration by penetrating acidic gastric juice, i.e. the acid resistance of the enteric coating layer of the pellets will not be sufficient in the tablet after compression.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides oral, fixed unit dosage forms, i.e. multiple unit tableted dosage forms, enteric coating layered tablets, multilayered tablets or capsules filled with more than one pharmaceutically active compound. The active compounds are preferably an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor in combination with one or more NSAIDs and wherein at least the proton pump inhibitor is protected by an enteric coated layer. These new dosage forms will simplify the regimen and improve the patient compliance.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
One object of the invention is to provide an oral, multiple unit tableted dosage form comprising an anti-ulcer drug, preferably an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor in the form of individually enteric coating layered units, together with one or more NS AIDs and tablet excipients compressed into a tablet The enteric coating layer(s) covering the individual units of the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor has properties such that the compression of the units into a tablet does not significantly affect the acid resistance of the<br><br>
individually enteric coating layered units. Furthermore, the multiple unit tableted dosage form provides a good stability to the active substances during long-term storage.<br>
Alternatively, the prepared tablet has separate layers, one layer that comprises the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor in the form of compressed enteric coated layered units and another layer that comprises the NSAID(s).<br>
The new fixed dosage form is preferably in the form of a multiple unit tableted dosage form comprising enteric coating layered units of the acid susceptible substance and the other active substance(s) in the granulated material constituting the rest of the compressed tablet, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Alternatively, the different active substances may be intimately mixed with each other and compressed into a conventional tablet, which is enteric coating layered, see Fig. 5, or both active substances are in the form of enteric coating layered pellets compressed into a multiple unit tableted formulation together with preferably fast disintegrating granules of inactive excipients, as exemplified in Fig. 4.<br>
Further alternatives are exemplified as multiple unit dosage forms wherein the proton pump inhibitor is in the form of individually enteric coating layered units and the NS AID(s) in the form of a) a complex to obtain improved bioavailability, see Fig. 2, or b) in the form of a gelling matrix resulting in a preparation with extended release of the NS AID(s), see Fig. 3. A further alternative is a multiple dosage form with the proton pump inhibitor in the form of individually enteric coating layered units compressed into a tablet and thereupon a separate layer of the NS AID(s) is applied by spray layering on the tablet. The tablet is covered by a pigmented filmcoating layer to protect the NSAID(s), see Fig. 6, because some NSAID(s) are light sensitive and require a light protecting layer.<br>
In still another alternative, the different active substances are dry mixed and filled into a capsule. In the latter preparation the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor is in the form of<br><br>
enteric coating layered units and the NS AID(s) is/are in the form of granules or alternatively in the form of modified release formulated units such as enteric coating layered units or units layered with a controlled release layer.<br>
The NSAID(s) may be formulated in instant release, sustained release or extended release formulations. Alternatively, the components may be formulated in an effervescent formulation. Furthermore, as some NSAID(s) are light sensitive the formulation is preferably light protected by a pigmented tablet filmcoating layer, as exemplified in Fig. 6, or by including a pigment in one of the coating layers to be applied on the tableted dosage form.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a dosage form which is divisible, such as divisible tablets.<br>
Still a further object of the invention is to provide a multiple unit tableted dosage form, which is divisible and easy to handle. Some of the multiple unit tableted dosage forms may be dispersed in a slightly acidic aqueous liquid and can be given to patients with swallowing disorders and in pediatrics. Such a suspension of dispersed units/pellets of appropriate size can be used for oral administration and also for feeding through a naso-gastric tube.<br>
The different active components used in the present dosage forms are defined below. Active substances<br>

(Figure Remove)<br>
The acid susceptible proton pump inhibitors used in the dosage forms of the invention may be used in their neutral form or in the form of an alkaline salt, such as for instance the Mg^.Ca^Na"1", K+ or Li+salts, preferably the Mg2+ salts. Further where applicable, the compounds listed above may be used in racemic form or in the form of the substantially pure enantiomer thereof, or alkaline salts of the single enantiomers.<br>
Suitable proton pump inhibitors are for example disclosed in EP-A1-0005129, EP-A1-174 726, EP-A1-166 287, GB 2 163 747 and WO90/06925, WO91/19711, WO91/19712, and further especially suitable compounds are described in WO95/01977 and WO94/27988.<br>
A wide variety of NS AIDs may be used in combination with a suitable proton pump inhibitor and optional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in the fixed unit dosage form according to the present invention. Such NS AIDs include for example propionic acid derivatives, oxicams, acetic acid and acetamide derivatives, salicylic acid derivatives and pyrazolidine derivatives.<br>
Also future NSAIDs like cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 selective NSAIDs and NO-releasing NSAIDs (de Soldato P, NO-releasing NSAID:s, A new class of safer anti-inflammatory analgesic and anti-pyrretic agents; The IV International meeting on side-effects of anti-inflammatory drugs August 7-9,1995) may be included.<br>
In the following examples of some suitable NSAIDs are listed: Acetyl salicylic acid, indometacin, diclofenac, piroxicam, tenoxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, nabumetone, ketorolac, azapropazone, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, sulindac, diflunisal, tiaprofenic acid, podophyllotoxin derivatives, acemetacin, aceclofenac, droxicam, oxaprozin, floctafenine, phenylbutazone, proglumetacin, flurbiprofen, tolmetin and fenbufen.<br>
The active NSAIDs could be in standard forms or used as salts, hydrates, esters etc. A combination of two or more of the above listed drugs may be used. Preferable NSAIDs for the new fixed dosage form are diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen and piroxicam.<br>
The preferred multiple unit tableted dosage form comprising a proton pump inhibitor (in the form of a racemat, an alkaline salt or one of its single enantiomers) and one or more NSAIDs, is characterized in the following way. Individually enteric coating layered units (small beads, granules or pellets) containing the proton pump inhibitor and optionally containing alkaline reacting substances, are mixed with the NSAID(s) and conventional tablet excipients. Preferably, the NS AID(s) and tablet excipients are in the form of a granulation. The dry mixture of enteric coating layered units, NSAID granules and optional excipients are compressed into multiple unit tableted dosage forms. With the expression "individual units" is meant small beads, granules or pellets, in the following referred to as pellets of the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor.<br>
The compaction process (compression) for formulating the multiple unit tableted dosage form must not significantly affect the acid resistance of the enteric coating layered pellets comprising the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor. In other words the mechanical properties, such as the flexibility and hardness as well as the thickness of the enteric coating<br>
layer(s), must secure that the requirements on enteric coated articles in the United States Pharmacopeia are accomplished in that the acid resistance does not decrease more than 10% during the compression of the pellets into tablets.<br>
The acid resistance is defined as the amount of proton pump inhibitor in the tablets or pellets after being exposed to simulated gastric fluid USP, or to 0,1 M HC1 (aq) relative to that of unexposed tablets and pellets, respectively. The test is accomplished in the following way. Individual tablets or pellets are exposed to simulated gastric fluid of a temperature of 37 °C. The tablets disintegrate rapidly and release the enteric coating layered pellets to the medium. After two hours the enteric coating layered pellets are removed and analyzed for content of the proton pump inhibitor using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Further specific components which may be used in the fixed unit dosage forms of the present invention are defined below.<br>
Core material - for enteric coating layered pellets/units<br>
The core material for the individually enteric coating layered pellets can be constituted according to different principles. Seeds layered with the proton pump inhibitor, optionally mixed with alkaline substances, can be used as the core material for the further processing.<br>
The seeds which are to be layered with the proton pump inhibitor can be water insoluble seeds comprising different oxides, celluloses, organic polymers and other materials, alone or in mixtures or water-soluble seeds comprising different inorganic salts, sugars, non-pareils and other materials, alone or in mixtures. Further, the seeds may comprise the proton pump inhibitor in the form of crystals, agglomerates, compacts etc. The size of the seeds is not essential for the present invention but may vary between approximately 0.1 and 2 mm. The seeds layered with the proton pump inhibitor are produced either by powder or<br>
solution/suspension layering using for instance granulation or spray coating layering equipment<br>
Before the seeds are layered, the proton pump inhibitor may be mixed with further components. Such components can be binders, surfactants fillers, disintegrating agents, alkaline additives or other and/or pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients alone or in mixtures. The binders are for example polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl-cellulose (HPC), carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), or sugars, starches or other pharmaceutically acceptable substances with cohesive properties. Suitable surfactants are found in the groups of pharmaceutically acceptable non-ionic or ionic surfactants such as for instance sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
Alternatively, the proton pump inhibitor optionally mixed with alkaline substances and further mixed with suitable constituents can be formulated into a core material. Said core material may be produced by extrusion/spheronization, balling or compression utilizing conventional process equipment. The size of the formulated core material is approximately between 0.1 and 4 mm and preferably between 0.1 and 2 mm. The manufactured core material can further be layered with additional ingredients comprising the proton pump inhibitor and/or be used for further processing.<br>
The proton pump inhibitor is mixed with pharmaceutical constituents to obtain preferred handling and processing properties and a suitable concentration of the proton pump inhibitor in the final preparation. Pharmaceutical constituents such as fillers, binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, surfactants and other pharmaceutically acceptable additives may be used.<br>
Further, the proton pump inhibitor may also be mixed with an alkaline, pharmaceutically acceptable substance (or substances). Such substances can be chosen among, but are not restricted to substances such as the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium salts of phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid or other suitable weak inorganic or<br><br>
organic acids; aluminium hydroxide/sodium bicarbonate coprecipitate; substances normally used in antacid preparations such as aluminium, calcium and magnesium hydroxides; magnesium oxide or composite substances, such as Al2O3.6MgO.CO2.12H2O, (Mg6Al2(OH)i6CO3.4H2O), MgO.Al2O3. 2SiO2.nH2O or similar compounds; organic pH-buffering substances such as trihydroxymethylaminomethane, basic amino acids and their salts or other similar, pharmaceutically acceptable pH-buffering substances.<br>
Alternatively, the aforementioned core material can be prepared by using spray drying or spray congealing technique.<br>
Enteric coating layer(s')<br>
Before applying the enteric coating layer(s) onto the core material in the form of individual pellets, the pellets may optionally be covered with one or more separating layer(s) comprising pharmaceutical excipients optionally including alkaline compounds such as pH-buffering compounds. This/these separating layer(s), separate(s) the core material from the outer layers being enteric coating layer(s). This/these separating layer(s) protecting the core material of proton pump inhibitor should be water soluble or rapidly disintegrating in water.<br>
The separating layer(s) can be applied to the core material by coating or layering procedures in suitable equipments such as coating pan, coating granulator or in a fluidized bed apparatus using water and/or organic solvents for the coating process. As an alternative the separating layer(s) can be applied to the core material by using powder coating technique. The materials for the separating layers are pharmaceutically acceptable compounds such as, for instance, sugar, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, water soluble salts of enteric coating polymers and others, used alone or in mixtures. Additives such as plasticizers, colorants, pigments, fillers anti-tacking and anti-static agents, such as for instance magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, talc and other additives may also be included into the separating layer(s).<br><br>
When the optional separating layer, is applied to the core material it may constitute a variable thickness. The maximum thickness of the separating layer(s) is normally only limited by processing conditions. The separating layer may serve as a diffusion barrier and may act as a pH-buffering zone. The pH-buffering properties of the separating layer(s) can be further strengthened by introducing into the layer(s) substances chosen from a group of compounds usually used in antacid formulations such as, for instance, magnesium oxide, hydroxide or carbonate, aluminium or calcium hydroxide, carbonate or silicate; composite aluminium/magnesium compounds such as, for instance Al2O3.6MgO.CO2.12H2O, (Mg6Al2(OH)i6CO3.4H2O), MgO.Al2O3.2SiO2.nH2O, aluminium hydroxide/sodium bicarbonate coprecipitate or similar compounds; or other pharmaceutically acceptable pH-buffering compounds such as, for instance the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium salts of phosphoric, carbonic, citric or other suitable, weak, inorganic or organic acids; or suitable organic bases, including basic amino acids and salts thereof. Talc or other compounds may be added to increase the thickness of the layer(s) and thereby strenghten the diffusion barrier. The optionally applied separating layer(s) is not essential for the invention. However, the separating layer(s) may improve the chemical stability of the active substance and/or the physical properties of the novel multiple unit tableted dosage form.<br>
Alternatively, the separating layer may be formed in situ by a reaction between an enteric coating polymer layer applied on the core material and an alkaline reacting compound in the core material. Thus, the separating layer formed comprises a water soluble salt formed between the enteric coating layer polymer(s) and an alkaline reacting compound which is in the position to form a salt<br>
One or more enteric coating layers are applied onto the core material or onto the core material covered with separating layer(s) by using a suitable coating technique. The enteric coating layer material may be dispersed or dissolved in either water or in suitable organic solvents.As enteric coating layer polymers one or more, separately or in combination, of the following can be used, e.g. solutions or dispersions of methacrylic acid copolymers,<br><br>
cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxymethylethylcellulose, shellac or other suitable enteric coating polymer(s).<br>
The enteric coating layers contain pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizers to obtain the desired mechanical properties, such as flexibility and hardness of the enteric coating layers. Such plasticizers are for instance, but not restricted to triacetin, citric acid esters, phthalic acid esters, dibutyl sebacate, cetyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, polysorbates or other plasticizers.<br>
The amount of plasticizer is optimized for each enteric coating layer formula, in relation to selected enteric coating layer polymer(s), selected plasticizer(s) and the applied amount of said polymer(s), in such a way that the mechanical properties, i.e. flexibility and hardness of the enteric coating layer(s), for instance exemplified as Vickers hardness, are adjusted so that the acid resistance of the pellets covered with enteric coating layer(s) does not decrease significantly during compression of pellets into tablets. The amount of plasticizer is usually above 10 % by weight of the enteric coating layer polymer(s), preferably 15 - 50 % and more preferably 20 - 50 %. Additives such as dispersants, colorants, pigments polymers e.g. poly (ethylacrylat, methylmethacrylat), anti-tacking and anti-foaming agents may also be included into the enteric coating layer(s). Other compounds may be added to increase film thickness and to decrease diffusion of acidic gastric juices into the acid susceptible material. To protect the acid susceptible substance, the proton pump inhibitor, and to obtain an acceptable acid resistance of the dosage form according to the invention, the enteric coating layer(s) constitutes a thickness of approximately at least 10 fim, preferably more than 20 \un. The maximum thickness of the applied enteric coating is normally only limited by processing conditions and the desired dissolution profile.<br>
The enteric coating layer may also be used for layering of the NSAID(s). Alternatively, the enteric coating layer described above may also be used for an enteric coating layer of conventional tablets comprising a composition of a proton pump inhibitor and one or more<br><br>
NSAIDs, optionally the prepared tablet core also is covered by one of the separating layers described above to separate the tablet core from the enteric coating layer.<br>
Over-coating layer<br>
Pellets covered with enteric coating layer(s) may further be covered with one or more overcoating layer(s). The over-coating layer(s) should be water soluble or rapidly disintegrating in water. The over-coating layer(s) can be applied to the enteric coating layered pellets by coating or layering procedures in suitable equipments such as coating pan, coating granulator or in a fluidized bed apparatus using water and/or organic solvents for the coating or layering process. The materials for over-coating layers are chosen among pharmaceutically acceptable compounds such as, for instance sugar, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium and others, used alone or in mixtures. Additives such as plasticizers, colorants, pigments, fillers, anti-tacking and anti-static agents, such for instance magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, talc and other additives may also be included into the over-coating layer(s). Said over-coating layer may further prevent potential agglomeration of enteric coating layered pellets, further it may protect the enteric coating layer towards cracking during the compaction process and enhance the tableting process. The maximum thickness of the applied over-coating layer(s) is normally limited by processing conditions and the desired dissolution profile. The over-coating layer may also be used as a tablet filmcoating layer.<br>
NS AID preparation<br>
The active substance(s) in the form of one or more NSAID substances is dry mixed with inactive excipients, wherein one or more of the excipients optionally is a disintegrant The mixture is wet massed with a granulation liquid. The wet mass is dried preferably to a loss on drying of less than 3% by weight Thereafter the dry mass is milled to a suitable size for<br><br>
the granules, such as smaller than 4 mm, and preferably smaller than 1 mm. Suitable inactive excipients for the NSAID granulation are for instance, sodium starch glycolate, corn starch, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol and colloidal silicon dioxide anhydrous (Aerosil®) and the like. The dry mixture comprising NS AID(s) is mixed with a suitable granulation liquid comprising for instance, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose and optionally wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulphate, dissolved in purified water or a suitable alcohol or a mixture thereof.<br>
Mechanical treatment may in some cases be used to form a complex between the NSAID(s) and a complex forming agent, such as beta-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin like in Example 3 below. Cyclodextrin complexes of NS AID(s) are shown to have an increased bioavailability of the NSAID(s), see for instance Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 19(7), 843-852,(1993).<br>
Further, the NS AID may be mixed with a gelling agent during the granulation, such as hydrophilic polymer(s). Suitable gelling hydrophilic polymers are for instance hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyoxyethylen (polyethylene glycol), hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and xantan. The granules may also comprise buffering substances. See for instance Example 4 below. Some NS AIDs irritate the gastric mucosa and benefit from a protecting enteric coating layer and may be formulated as enteric coating layered pellets.<br>
Multiple unit tablets<br>
The enteric coating layered pellets comprising a proton pump inhibitor are mixed with the granules comprising NS AID(s) and tablet excipients. The mixture is compressed into a multiple unit tableted dosage form. The compressed tablet is optionally covered with a filmforming agent(s) to obtain a smooth surface of the tablet and further enhance the stability of the tablet during packaging and transport. Such a tablet filmcoating layer may further comprise additives such as anti-tacking agents, colorants and pigments or other<br><br>
additives to obtain a tablet of good appearance and with a light-protection for light sensitive components.<br>
The enteric coated pellets with or without an over-coat and the NS AID granules are mixed with tablet excipients such as fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants and other pharmaceutically acceptable additives and compressed into tablets. Suitable lubricants for the tableting process are for instance sodium stearyl fumarate, magnesium stearate and talc.<br>
Alternatively, the NSAID(s) may be dry mixed with the enteric coating layered pellets comprising the proton pump inhibitor optionally together with inactive excipients and compressed into tablets (direct compression), or the different active substances may be formulated in different layers, optionally the NSAID(s) in the form of a layer with a controlled release.<br>
Further, both the NS AID(s) and the proton pump inhibitor in the form of enteric coating layered pellets may be mixed with inactive tablet excipients and compressed into a tablet The compressed tablet is optionally covered by a tablet filmcoating layer to obtain a tablet of good appearance.<br>
As a further alternative a multiple unit tableted dosage form comprising the proton pump inhibitor is spray coating layered by a suspension or solution comprising the NSAID(s). The prepared tablet is thereafter covered by a pigmented tablet filmcoating layer.<br>
The fraction of enteric coating layered pellets constitutes less than 75 % by weight of the total tablet weight and preferably less than 60 %. By increasing the amount of the granules comprising the NSAJD(s) the fraction of enteric coating layered proton pump inhibitor pellets in the multiple unit dosage form may be reduced. By choosing small enteric coating layered pellets in the formulation according to the present invention, the number of pellets in each tablet can be held high which in turn makes the tablet divisible with retained dosing accuracy.<br><br>
Thus, the preferred multiple unit tablet formulation consists of enteric coating layered pellets containing one active substance in the form of an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor, optionally mixed with alkaline reacting compound(s), compressed into tablet together with granules containing NS AID(s) and optionally tablet excipients. The addition of an alkaline reacting material to the proton pump inhibitor is not necessary, in any sense but such a substance may further enhance the stability of the proton pump inhibitor or some of the alkaline reacting compounds may react in situ with the enteric coating material to form a separating layer. The enteric coating layer(s) is making the pellets of the dosage form insoluble in acidic media, but disintegrating/dissolving in near neutral to alkaline media such as, for instance the liquids present in the proximal part of the small intestine, where dissolution of the proton pump inhibitor is desired. The NSAID(s) may be released in the stomach. The enteric coating layered pellets may further be covered with an overcoating layer before being formulated into the tablet and they may also contain one or more separating layer(s) in between the core material and the enteric coating layer.<br>
Process<br>
The process for the manufacture of the dosage form represents a further aspect of the invention. After formulation of the pellets by spray coating or layering of the proton pump inhibitor onto seeds, or by extrusion/spheronization or granulation, e.g. rotor granulation of homogeneous pellets, the pellets are first optionally covered with the separating layer(s) and then with the enteric coating layer(s) or a separating layer is spontaneously developed in situ between an alkaline core material and the enteric coating layer material. The coating is carried out as described above and in the accompanying examples. The preparation of the granules comprising the NSAID(s) and enteric coating layered NS AID pellets are also described above and in the examples. The pharmaceutical processes can preferably be completely water-based.<br><br>
The enteric coating layered pellets, with or without an over-coat, are mixed with the prepared granules, tablet excipients and other pharmaceutical acceptable additives and compressed into tablets. Alternatively, the different active substances in the form of powders may be intimately dry mixed with tablet excipients, wet massed and compressed into conventional tablets before applying an optional separating layer and an enteric coating layer. The NSAID(s) may also be incorporated in a coating layer applied onto a multiple unit dosage form comprising the proton pump inhibitor, or the NSAID(s) and proton pump inhibitor in the form of enteric coating layered pellets are mixed with inactive tablet excipients and compressed into a multiple unit tableted dosage form.<br>
The different active substances may also be formulated into different layers, wherein the layer comprising the NSAID(s) may be in the form of a control release preparation. As a further alternative, the acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor in the form of enteric coating layered pellets may be filled in a capsule together with the NSAID(s) in the form of granules or enteric coating layered pellets, and optionally mixed with pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Use of the preparation<br>
The dosage forms according to the invention are especially advantageous in the treatment of gastrointestinal side-effects caused by NS AID(s), such as in a continuous treatment with NSAID(s). The new dosage forms are administered one to several times a day, preferably once or twice daily. The typical daily dose of the active substances varies and will depend on various factors such as the individual requirements of the patients, the mode of administration and disease. In general each dosage form will comprise 0,1-200 mg of the proton pump inhibitor and 0,1-1 000 mg of the NSAID(s). Preferably, each dosage form will comprise 10-80 mg of the proton pump inhibitor and 10-800 mg of the NS AID(s), and more preferably 10-40 mg of proton pump inhibitor and 10-500 mg of the NSAID(s), respectively. Especially preferred combinations comprise for instance 10 mg omeprazole together with 50 mg diclofenac, 10 mg omeprazole and 250 mg naproxen, 10 mg omeprazole and 10 mg piroxicam, or 10 mg omeprazole and 400 mg ibuprofen.<br><br>
The multiple unit tablet preparation may also be suitable for dispersion in an aqueous h'quid with slightly acidic pH-value before being orally administered or fed through a naso-gastric tube.<br>
