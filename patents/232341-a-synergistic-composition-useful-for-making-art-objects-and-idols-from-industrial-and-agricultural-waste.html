				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a composition useful for making art objects and idols from industrial and agricultural waste <br><br>
 The process of the present invention particularly relates to the use of wide variety of industrial wastes, viz., waste pulp from paper industries, fly ash from thermal power plant and rice husk ash for making art objects and idols.<br>
The main usage of this composition is in the field of idol making, mask making, toy industries, making of unbreakable materials where light weight high impact resistance materials are needed. The present day method of making idol is a traditional method which essentially consists of making of a skeleton with straw and bamboo sticks upon which finely ground common clay is pasted manually to give the desired formation. The method of making art objects with common clay is moulding, slip casting of finely ground common clay mixed with water. It is then dried, painted and finished to get the final product. The main drawbacks of the present process may be summarised as follows:<br>
1.	The final product is heavy<br>
2.	The final product is brittle<br><br>
3. Consumes considerable amount of common clay destroying ecological<br>
balance.<br>
Coventional Papier Mache, a mixture of paper pulp and plaster of Paris is<br>
also used for making art objects and masks. However, papier mache is not<br>
found to be suitable for making solid and  slip castable unbreakable<br>
materials.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a synnergistic<br>
composition useful for making art objects and idols from industrial and<br>
agricultural waste and a process of making art objects and idols thereof<br>
which obviates the above drawbacks.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to utilise otherwise pollutant<br>
waste paper pulp for making idols and art object.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to utilise industrial wastes<br>
like fly ash or rice husk ash for making idols and art object.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition<br>
useful for making high impact resistant idols and art object<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition<br>
useful for making unbreakable idols and art object.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a synergistic composition<br>
useful for making art objects and idols from industrial and agricultural<br>
wastes which comprises<br><br>
Dry paper pulp      : 50 to 70 weight percent<br>
Rice husk ash        : 5 to 20 weight percent<br>
Fly ash	: 5 to 20 weight percent<br>
Clay	: 10 to 50 weight percent<br>
In an embodiment    of the present invention the clay used is such as<br>
common clay and china clay.<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a<br>
synergistic mixture having properties which are distinct and not a mere<br>
aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making art objects<br>
or idols from the   composition of the present invention which comprises<br>
through mixing of paper pulp waste, clay, rice husk ash and fly ash with<br>
water for 10 to  15 hrs,  converting the mixture to mud or slip by<br>
conventional method, moulding or slip casting to desired shape, drying the<br>
fabricated shape, finishing and painting by known methods.<br>
The details of the process of the present invention is given below:<br>
i) Dry waste paper pulp, clay and rice husk ash and fly ash are mixed with<br>
water.<br>
ii) The above mixture is wet mixed for 10 hr to 15 hr.<br>
iii) The mixture is converted to mud or slip by known methods.<br>
iv) The mud or slip is moulded or slip casted by moulding or slip casting.<br><br>
v) The moulded or slip casted materials are dried.<br>
vi) The dried materials are finished and painted.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce idols, musks.<br>
toys, art objects and unbreakable materials where light weight high impact<br>
resistance material is required.<br>
Clay is a colloidal gel which  shrinks and  becomes  hard  on  being<br>
dehydrated. Raw clay is unsuitable for making clay products because<br>
articles made in such way will undergo large shrinkage causing loss of<br>
shape and cracking during drying. Though waste paper pulp is highly<br>
impact resistant, it can not be used as the base of a body due to its non<br>
plastic nature. Rice husk ash has the antishrinkage filler property' and can<br>
also provide cementing action. Hence none of the above materials can<br>
alone provide all the desired properties to the articles. But a synergistic<br>
mixture consisting plastic clay, non plastic cementicious fly ash, fibrous<br>
paper pulp will generate the desired properties.<br>
The novelty lies in providing a syn, ergistic composition using industrial<br>
*<br>
and agricultural waste. The inventing step lies in combining highly impact resistant paper pulp with cementicious rice husk ash and fly ash and plastic clay.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
500 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 300 gms of china clay 100 gms of fly ash and 100 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 10 hours. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and casted in proper moulds. The<br>
casted materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated.<br>
Example 2<br>
500 gms of dry waste paper pulp. 200 gms of china clay. 100 gms of fly ash and 200 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 15 hours. The mixture was taken out, shaped manually to different forms for making toys and idols. The materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated.<br>
Example 3<br>
500 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 100 gms of china clay 200 gms of fly ash and 200 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 12 hours. The mixture was taken out,<br><br>
sodium silicate was added to make slip and casted in proper moulds. The casted materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated.<br>
Example 4<br>
500 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 250 gms of china clay 200 gms of fly ash and 50 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 10 hours.

600 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 250 gms of china clay 50 gms of fly ash and 100 ems rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 12 hours. The mixture was taken out,<br><br>
sodium silicate was added to make slip and casted in proper moulds. The casted materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated.<br>
Example 7<br>
700 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 100 gms of china clay 150 gms of fly ash and 50 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 14 hours. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and casted in proper moulds. The casted materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated.<br>
Example 8<br>
600 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 300 gms of china clay 50 gms of fly ash and 50 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 12 hours. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and casted in proper moulds. The casted materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated.<br>
Example 9<br>
500 gms of dry waste paper pulp, 400 gms of china clay 50 gms of fly ash and 50 gms rice husk ash were thoroughly wet mixed with required quantity of water for a period of 10 hours. The mixture was taken.out,<br><br>
sodium silicate was added to make slip and casted in proper moulds. The casted materials were dried, finished, painted with water resistant paint and decorated. The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
