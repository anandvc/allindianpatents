				<td>METHOD FOR CONTROLLING GATED TRANSMISSION OF<br>
DEDICATED CHANNEL IN W-CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method of controlling gated<br>
transmission (i.e., intermittent transmission of a dedicated control channel signal)<br>
between a base station (UTRAN) and a mobile station (UE(MS)) in a W-CDMA<br>
(Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access) communication system, and in<br>
particular, to a method of efficiently using dedicated channels for transmission of<br>
packet data.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A conventional CDMA communication system, principally configured for<br>
transmission of voice and data, transmits data on a dedicated channel. To do so,<br>
a dedicated channel is assigned to transmit data and is released after the data<br>
transmission is complete. The assignment and release of resources is frequently<br>
done to provide services other than voice service, such as packet data service in<br>
the conventional method. The resulting reconnection time delay makes it<br>
difficult to provide satisfactory voice services. In many cases, packet data is<br>
discontinuously transmitted, wherein a non-transmission period is interposed<br>
between packet transmission periods. When transmitting packet data<br>
discontinuously using the conventional channel controlling method, the channel<br>
should be either released or maintained during the pauses between data<br>
transmission. If the channel is released, reassignment of the channel is time<br>
consuming and thus a satisfactory packet data service cannot be provided. On<br>
the other hand, channel maintenance ties up resources and increases power<br>
consumption causing interference.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is a need for developing a new method of assigning a<br>
channel to provide services other than voice service, for example, packet data<br>
services. FIG. 1 illustrates the various states of an UE(MS) defined according to<br>
the type of radio resources assigned for data transmission in a W-CDMA<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the various channel states of the UE(MS) are<br>
categorized into a CellDCH state where a dedicated channel is assigned for data<br>
transmission, a Cell_FACH state which allows only transmission of a small<br>
amount of data on a common channel, a Cell_PCH state which requests an<br>
UE(MS) position to be registered in terms of a cell, and a URA_PCH (UTRAN<br>
Registration Area_PCH) state which requests an UE(MS) position to be registered<br>
in terms of a UTRAN Registration Area (URA). No data transmission is<br>
allowed in both the Cell_PCH and URA_PCH states. Assignment of a dedicated<br>
channel to an UE(MS) in the Cell_DCH state is considered in two ways: first, the<br>
dedicated channel is continuously used until it is released; and second, the<br>
dedicated channel is used only while a predetermined amount of data is<br>
transmitted or data is transmitted for a predetermined time. The conventional<br>
method supports an intermittent burst data transmission service by allowing<br>
continuous use of a dedicated channel until all the data is transmitted, or releasing<br>
a dedicated channel after transmission of burst data and then reassigning the<br>
dedicated channel by use of a dedicated reassignment request message on a<br>
common channel. In the former case, uplink and downlink dedicated control<br>
channels should be transmitted continuously to maintain them even in the absence<br>
of data to be transmitted on a dedicated data channel, thereby dissipating the<br>
channels and unnecessary power. In the latter case, services cannot be provided<br>
stably because the time to reassign channels varies.<br>
FIGs. 2A to 3B are the structures of signals transmitted from a UTRAN<br>
and an UE(MS) according to the conventional technology.<br>
FIG. 2A illustrates the structure of an UE(MS) transmission signal upon<br>
the absence of data to be transmitted on a uplink DPDCH (Dedicated Physical<br>
Data Channel) during uplink data transmission, and FIG. 2B illustrates the<br><br>
structure of a UTRAN transmission signal upon the absence of data to be<br>
transmitted on a downlink DPDCH during downlink data transmission.<br>
Reference numeral 200 in FIG. 2A and reference numeral 250 in FIG. 2B denote<br>
time points when transmission of dedicated data channels are stopped due to<br>
absence of transmission data on the uplink DPDCH and on the downlink DPDCH,<br>
respectively. After the time points, only dedicated physical control<br>
channels(DPCCH) are continuously transmitted so as not to lose synchronization<br>
of the uplink and downlink. The continuous transmission of the dedicated control<br>
channels (DPCCHs) is advantageous in that when uplink or downlink<br>
transmission data is generated, the data can be reliably transmitted on the<br>
dedicated data channels (DPDCHs) without any time delay. This can be<br>
confirmed from FIGs. 3A and 3B.<br>
FIG. 3A is a signal diagram illustrating data transmission on a uplink<br>
dedicated data channel (DPDCH) upon generation of data to be transmitted on a<br>
uplink during transmission of only a uplink dedicated control channel (DPCCH),<br>
and FIG. 3B is a signal diagram illustrating data transmission on a downlink<br>
dedicated data channel (DPDCH) upon generation of data to be transmitted on a<br>
downlink during transmission of only a downlink dedicated control channel<br>
(DPCCH). Reference numeral 300 in FIG. 3A and reference numeral 350 in FIG.<br>
3B denote time points when data transmission resumes on the dedicated data<br>
channel. Frames are transmitted again immediately after the time points when<br>
transmission data is generated. Unfortunately, the continuous transmission of<br>
uplink and downlink dedicated control channels (DPCCHs) increases interference<br>
on the uplink and downlink. As a result, uplink and downlink channel capacities<br>
are decreased and UE(MS) power consumption is increased.<br>
Therefore, gated transmission of dedicated control channels (DPCCHs) is<br>
preferable in order to use the transmission channels efficiently and to provide<br>
stable service. Gated transmission also minimizes the increase of interference<br>
caused by the continuous transmission of bidirectional dedicated controls<br>
channels and the increase of power consumption in an UE(MS).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
It is, therefore, a first object of the present invention to provide a method<br>
of gated transmitting a dedicated control channel (DPCCH) in a gated mode when<br>
data is not transmitted on a dedicated data channel for a predetermined time after<br>
the dedicated channel is assigned in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is a second object of the present invention to provide a method of gated<br>
transmitting a uplink dedicated control channel signal in a gated mode by<br>
requesting a gated transmission to a UTRAN when an UE(MS) has no data to be<br>
transmitted on a uplink for a predetermined time in a mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
It is a third object of the present invention to provide a method of gated<br>
transmitting a downlink dedicated control channel signal in a gated mode by<br>
controlling an UE(MS) when there is no data to be transmitted on a downlink for<br>
a predetermined time in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is a fourth object of the present invention to provide a method of gated<br>
receiving a uplink dedicated control channel signal in a gated mode from an<br>
UE(MS) by a UTRAN in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is a fifth object of the present invention to provide a method of gated<br>
receiving a downlink dedicated control channel signal in a gated mode from a<br>
UTRAN by an UE(MS) in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is a sixth object of the present invention to provide a method of<br>
transmitting data on a uplink by an UE(MS) when transmission data is generated<br>
during gated transmission in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is a seventh object of the present invention to provide a method of<br>
transmitting data on a downlink by a UTRAN when transmission data is<br>
generated during gated transmission in a mobile communication system.<br>
Briefly, these and other objects can be achieved by providing a gated<br><br>
transmission method. In the gated transmission method, a first party transmits a<br>
message indicating that a gated transmission condition is satisfied. Upon receipt<br>
of a response message from a second party, the first party transmits a gated<br>
transmission command message. Then, the first party performs gated<br>
transmission according to parameters included in the gated transmission message.<br>
The parameters include a gating rate, a gated transmission start time, a gated<br>
transmission pattern, and a power increment by which to increase the transmission<br>
power of a channel when transmitting data on the channel during the gated<br>
transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br><br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention pertains to the gated transmission of a dedicated<br>
control channel (DPCCH) when no data is transmitted for a predetermined period<br>
of time during transmission of data via dedicated channels (DPDCH) in a W-<br>
CDMA mobile communication system. Gated transmission minimizes the<br>
power consumption and channel dissipation in an UE(MS), which result from the<br>
continuous transmission of a dedicated control channel in the absence of data to<br>
be transmitted on a dedicated data channel (DPDCH). The gated transmission of a<br>
dedicated control channel (DPCCH) in the W-CDMA communication system is<br>
advantageous because a physical channel can be maintained in sync, the<br>
transmission power can be reduced, and a closed loop power control can be<br>
implemented.<br>
The following description is conducted assuming that a frame is 10msec<br>
in duration, there are 15 power control groups present in one frame, and one<br>
power control group is about 0.667msec in duration. However, those values are<br>
merely selected for better understanding of the subject matter of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The gated transmission method of the present invention is not<br>
continuously transmitting dedicated control channel signal but gated transmitting.<br>
Whether a UTRAN determines gating parameters in response to an<br>
UE(MS) request or the UTRAN requests an UE capability to determine gating<br>
parameter, it can be further contemplated that the gating parameters can be set at a<br>
call set-up by mutual agreement between the UTRAN and the UE(MS). The<br>
gating parameters include a gating indicator, a gating rate, a gated transmission<br>
start time, a gated transmission pattern, and an increase power strength when<br>
transmitting data on dedicated data channel in the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, but it is to be clearly understood that other parameters can be added<br>
when necessary.<br><br>
FIG. 4A is a flowchart illustrating a gated transmission procedure of a<br>
uplink dedicated channel in an UE(MS) in the absence of uplink transmission data<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4A, the UE(MS) transmits control data on a uplink<br>
dedicated control channel (DPCCH) and packet data on a uplink dedicated data<br>
channel (DPDCH) in step 400. As above, after the UE(MS) transmits the data<br>
on dedicated channel, the UE checks whether uplink transmission data exists in<br>
step 401. In the presence of uplink transmission data, the UE(MS) returns to<br>
step 400 and transmits the data. On the other hand, in the absence of uplink<br>
transmission data, the UE(MS) transmits only control data on the dedicated<br>
control channel (DPCCH) in step 402.<br>
In step 403, the UE(MS) determines a time period for which no data is<br>
transmitted on the dedicated data channel (DPDCH) in order to prevent gate<br>
transmission during a short non-data transmission period. If the dedicated data<br>
channel (DPDCH) has not been used for the predetermined time in step 403, the<br>
UE(MS) checks whether data has been received on a downlink dedicated data<br>
channel (DPDCH) in step 404. Checking whether data has been received on a<br>
downlink dedicated data channel (DPDCH) ensures that the uplink and downlink<br>
dedicated data channels (DPDCHs) are not transmitting and receiving. This is a<br>
prerequisite for gated transmission on dedicated control channel (DPCCH)s<br>
(DPCCHs). If data is received on the downlink dedicated data channel<br>
(DPDCH), the UE(MS) returns to step 401 to check whether uplink transmission<br>
data exist. Upon generation of uplink transmission data in step 401, the UE(MS)<br>
returns to step 400. However, it can be further contemplated that since a uplink<br>
gated transmission condition is satisfied in step 403, the UE(MS) skips step 404<br>
and notifies the UTRAN that the UE(MS) is capable of uplink gated transmission<br>
so that the UTRAN determines whether to perform gated transmission by<br>
checking for the presence or absence of downlink transmission data.<br>
In step 405, the UE(MS) checks whether data has been generated for<br>
transmission on the uplink dedicated data channel (DPDCH) while checking<br>
whether data has been received on the downlink dedicated data channel. If the<br><br>
UE(MS) detects uplink transmission data in step 405, the UE(MS) returns to step<br>
400. In the absence of uplink transmission data in step 405, the UE(MS)<br>
transmits a message notifying that the gated transmission condition is satisfied to<br>
the UTRAN in step 406. The message may be a MEASUREMENT REPORT<br>
defined by the universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS).<br>
Then, the UE(MS) awaits receipt of a response message from the<br>
UTRAN in step 407. The response message should include information about a<br>
gating rate, a gated transmission start time, an increase power strength when<br>
transmitting data on dedicated data channel to be used for power control during<br>
gated transmission, and a gated transmission pattern, which is necessary for the<br>
UE(MS) to perform a gated transmission. When the UTRAN prepare the<br>
response message, the UTRAN reflects the result of checking whether downlink<br>
transmission data exists and the gated transmission capability of the UE(MS) if<br>
the UTRAN is informed of the capability through a procedure as shown in FIG. 9<br>
in determining the gated transmission-related parameters. Furthermore, the<br>
UTRAN can limit an available data rate for gated transmission and include the<br>
data rate limit in the response message. The response message can be<br>
constructed by adding message fields defined in FIG. 10 to a UMTS-defined<br>
message "TRANSPORT CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION" or "PHYSICAL<br>
CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION".<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates the structure of a gated transmission command<br>
message generated from a UTRAN, including parameters for gated transmission<br>
of a dedicated control channel.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a gating indicator 1000 can be a one bit-field for<br>
informing whether gated transmission-related information exists. A gating rate<br>
field designates a gating transmission rate 1010. N1 1020 indicates a gated<br>
transmission start time and varies in the number of bits depending on the form<br>
used to express the start time. N2 1030 is a field that provides a gated<br>
transmission pattern. That is, N2 1030 determines whether a gated transmission<br>
pattern is to be made periodical or random, or informs a downlink gated<br>
transmission pattern to be used. N3 1040 provides a power increment of a<br><br>
dedicated data channel which is used to compensate for power control losses that<br>
occur during data transmission in a gated transmission mode.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an example of gated transmission of a dedicated control<br>
channel according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, reference numeral 600 denotes the structure of a<br>
downlink channel and reference numerals 650 and 660 denote exemplary gated<br>
transmission patterns of a downlink dedicated coatrol channel-. The gated<br>
transmission in those patterns is possible because the dedicated control channel<br>
is distributed as shown in the downlink channel structure 600. In the gated<br>
transmission 650, only TFCI (Transport Format Combination Indicator) bits in<br>
one slot are excluded from transmission on a dedicated control channel. In this<br>
case, pilots are transmitted in all slots and TPC (Transmit Power control) bits are<br>
transmitted or not depending on the transmission rate of the uplink dedicated<br>
control channel. In the gated transmission 660, one entire slot is not transmitted.<br>
The gated transmission rates in both cases are 1/2. Since a gated transmission<br>
start time should be set with the UTRAN and the UE(MS) in accurate<br>
synchronization with each other, the UE(MS) should wait until a gated<br>
transmission start time designated in the response message as shown in step 408<br>
of FIG. 4A. If the response message is received in step 407 of FIG. 4A and the<br>
response message sets a limit for the radio resources to be used for gated<br>
transmission, only those allowed radio resources should be used during the gated<br>
transmission. In addition, gated transmission can be implemented on only one of<br>
the uplink and downlink dedicated control channels according to whether the<br>
UE(MS) and the UTRAN support gated transmission.<br>
FIG. 7A is a diagram of transmitted and received signals of a UTRAN<br>
and an UE(MS) when gated transmission is performed in the absence of data on a<br>
uplink dedicated data channel during uplink data transmission. The drawing<br>
shows UE(MS) signals when the message is not retransmitted notifying that a<br>
gated transmission condition has been satisfied in step 407 of FIG. 4A.<br>
In FIG. 7A, the uplink dedicated data channel is no longer transmitted<br><br>
after the last frame in a period 700. The uplink dedicated data channel is not in<br>
use for a period 710, which is checked in step 403 of FIG. 4A. In a period 720,<br>
the UE(MS) transmits the message indicating that the gated transmission<br>
condition is satisfied, receives the response message, and waits until the gated<br>
transmission start time set in the response message. A period 730 varies<br>
according to the response message. FIG. 7A shows a gated transmission route of<br>
1/3. The UTRAN may set the gated transmission rate to 1/3 or 1/5.<br>
FIG. 4B is a flowchart illustrating a gated transmission procedure of a<br>
downlink dedicated channel in a UTRAN in the absence of downlink transmission<br>
data according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4B, the UTRAN transmits control data on a downlink<br>
dedicated control channel and packet data on a downlink dedicated data channel<br>
in step 450. The UTRAN checks whether downlink transmission data exists in<br>
step 451. In the absence of downlink transmission data, the UTRAN transmits<br>
only control data on the dedicated control channel in step 452 and checks a period<br>
for which no packet data has been transmitted on the dedicated data channel in<br>
step 453. If the dedicated data channel has not been transmitted for the<br>
predetermined time in step 453, the UTRAN checks whether data has been<br>
received on a uplink dedicated data channel in step 454 for the same reason as in<br>
step 404 of FIG. 4A. Upon receipt of data on the uplink dedicated data channel,<br>
which implies that the UE(MS) continuously transmits data, the UTRAN returns<br>
to step 451 to check whether downlink transmission data has been generated.<br>
If no data has been received on the uplink dedicated data channel in step<br>
454, which implies that the gated transmission condition is satisfied, the UTRAN<br>
checks again whether downlink transmission data has been generated in step 455.<br>
In the absence of downlink transmission data in step 455, the UTRAN generates a<br>
gated transmission command message and transmits it to the UE(MS) in steps 456<br>
and 457. The message can be constructed by adding the fields defined in FIG.<br>
10 to an UMTS-defined message, TRANSPORT CHANNEL<br>
RECONFIGURATION or PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION.<br>
Upon generation of downlink transmission data in step 455, the UTRAN returns<br>
to step 450 to transmit using the dedicated data channel and the dedicated control<br><br>
channel.<br>
Because the UTRAN is responsible for control of gated transmission, the<br>
UTRAN determines gated transmission parameters including a gated transmission<br>
rate, a gated transmission time period, a gated transmission pattern, and a power<br>
increment for a dedicated data channel (DPDCH) in case of generation of<br>
transmission data during gated transmission in step 456, prior to transmission of<br>
the gated transmission command message in step 457. Information fields of the<br>
gated transmission command message are shown in FIG. 10.<br>
If the UTRAN receives information about the current radio environment<br>
and gated transmission-related information in a procedure shown in FIG. 9 from<br>
the UE(MS) in step 456 of FIG. 4B, it aids in determining the gated transmission<br>
parameters. In the embodiment of the present invention, the UTRAN retransmits<br>
the gated transmission command message when it fails to receive the response<br>
message from the UE(MS) in step 458. Yet, if the UE(MS) provides information<br>
about an operation for the case of non-response transmission, the UTRAN<br>
operates based on the information.<br>
In step 459 of FIG. 4B, the UTRAN initiates gated transmission of a<br>
downlink dedicated control channel. If the UTRAN judges from a received<br>
uplink dedicated control channel that the downlink dedicated data channel can be<br>
maintained at a reduced gated transmission rate, it orders the UE(MS) to modify<br>
the gated transmission. The gated transmission modification can also be<br>
requested if the UTRAN determines that it is difficult to maintain the dedicated<br>
data channel at a current gated transmission rate. A gated transmission<br>
modification command message should include information about when to start a<br>
modified gated transmission. The UE(MS) initiates gated transmission in step<br>
408 of FIG. 4A. Upon receipt of the gated transmission modification command<br>
message from the UTRAN in this state, the UE(MS) should make a modification<br>
to the gated transmission at the time designated in the message.<br>
FIG. 7B is a diagram of transmitted and received signals of a UTRAN<br>
when gated transmission is performed at a gating rate of 1/3 due to the absence of<br><br>
data on a downlink dedicated data channel and uplink DPDCH signal during<br>
downlink data transmission according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 7B, the downlink and uplink dedicated data channel is not transmitted for<br>
a period 760, which is checked in step 453 of FIG. 4B. A period 770 is set in the<br>
gated transmission command message transmitted in step 457 of FIG. 4B. A<br>
period 780 is also set in the gated transmission command message. Fig. 7B is the<br>
embodiment of gating rate 1/3 transmission.<br>
FIG. 5A is a flowchart illustrating an UE(MS) operation when uplink<br>
transmission data is generated during gated transmission of a uplink dedicated<br>
control channel according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, gated transmission of the dedicated control channel<br>
is in progress in step 500. To compensate for the decrease of a power control<br>
cycle in transmitting a dedicated data channel during the gated transmission, the<br>
transmission power of the dedicated data channel is increased. In this case,<br>
signaling data and traffic data are transmitted as long as the traffic data is so small<br>
that the increased power-caused interference is less than a capacity increase that<br>
gated transmission brings about. In step 501, it is checked whether transmission<br>
data is generated. If so, the process proceeds to step 502. If not, the process<br>
proceeds to step 500. In step 502, the UE(MS) determines whether transmission<br>
data is signaling or traffic data. If it is signaling data, it is always transmitted in<br>
step 503 because the signaling data is small. On the other hand, if it is traffic<br>
data, the UE(MS) checks the size of the traffic data in step 504 and transmits it<br>
during the gated transmission if it is small in step 505.<br>
If the traffic data is large, the UE(MS) transmits a message indicating that<br>
a gated transmission stop condition has been satisfied in step 506 and determines<br>
whether a response message has been received from the UTRAN in step 507. If<br>
the UE(MS) fails to receive the response message, the UE(MS) retransmits the<br>
above message in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The response message should include information about radio resources to be<br>
used and a time point to use them. The UE(MS) starts to transmit data on the<br>
dedicated data channel at the designated time. If data is to be transmitted during<br><br>
the gated transmission as in steps 503 and 505, the dedicated control channel<br>
can be transmitted in a gated mode or in a continuous transmission mode to<br>
increase the decoding efficiency of a receiver in the second party. Also for the<br>
period between step 506 and step 507, the dedicated control channel can be<br>
transmitted in the gated mode or in the continuous transmission mode. An<br>
UMTS-defined message, MEASUREMENT REPORT can be used as the<br>
message indicating that a gated transmission stop condition is satisfied.<br>
FIG. 8A is a diagram of transmitted and received signals of an UE(MS)<br>
upon generation of uplink transmission data during gated transmission of a uplink<br>
dedicated control channel according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, a time when a message indicating that the condition<br>
of stopping gated transmission has been satisfied for a period 800 is transmitted<br>
should satisfy step504 of FIG. 5A. In a period 810, the UE(MS) receives the<br>
response message from the UTRAN and waits until the time designated in the<br>
response message. When the message for the period 800 is transmitted, the<br>
dedicated control channel is transmitted in a continuous transmission mode, but it<br>
can be a gated transmission mode is available. Similarly, the dedicated control<br>
channel is shown to be transmitted continuously for the period 810, but it can be<br>
maintained in the gated transmission mode.<br>
FIG. 5B is a flowchart illustrating a UTRAN operation when downlink<br>
transmission data is generated during gated transmission of a downlink dedicated<br>
control channel according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5B, steps 551, 552 and 554 perform the same functions<br>
as steps 501, 502 and 504 of FIG. 5A. The UTRAN transmits a gated<br>
transmission stop message including information about radio resources to be used<br>
and a time point to use them, taking account of the amount of downlink data to<br>
transmit. When the UTRAN transmits the gated transmission stop message in<br>
step 556, it can transmit the control data on dedicated control channel in a gated<br>
transmission mode or in a continuous transmission mode. Also for the period<br>
between step 556 and step 557, the control data on dedicated control channel<br><br>
can be transmitted in the gated mode or in the continuous transmission mode.<br>
While the UTRAN retransmits the gated transmission stop message when it has<br>
not received a response message from the UE(MS) in accordance with the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a different approach can be taken. The<br>
UTRAN waits until a time designated in the gated transmission stop message in<br>
step 558.<br>
FIG. 8B is a diagram of transmitted and received signals of a UTRAN<br>
upon generation of downlink transmission data during gated transmission of a<br>
downlink dedicated control channel according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, though the dedicated control channel is<br>
continuously transmitted for periods 850 and 860, it can also be transmitted in a<br>
gated mode. The period 860 is set in the gated transmission stop message as<br>
indicated by 850.<br>
Continuous transmission of a dedicated control channel, even in the<br>
absence of transmission data enables a dedicated data channel to be maintained in<br>
a stable manner and transmitted at any time. Despite these advantages, the<br>
resulting increase of uplink interference reduces uplink capacity. Power<br>
consumption in an UE(MS) is also increased, thereby reducing time available to<br>
the UE(MS). In addition, continuous transmission of a downlink dedicated<br>
control channel increases downlink interference and decreases downlink capacity.<br>
The present invention implements gated transmission of dedicated control<br>
channels in order to overcome the problems associated with the conventional<br>
methods.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
