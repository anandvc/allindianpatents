METHOD OF MONITORING CONTROL CHANNEL IN<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to wireless communication, and more particularly, to a<br>
method of reducing battery consumption of a user equipment in a wireless com-<br>
munication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A conventional wide code division multiple access (WCDMA)-based wireless com-<br>
munication method is a very effective wireless transmission method in which voice-<br>
based data is transmitted at a low speed and a soft handover is taken into consideration,<br>
but is ineffective when data is transmitted at a high speed in a multi-path fading en-<br>
vironment. An evolved-universal mobile telecommunications system (E-UMTS)<br>
proposes a downlink transmission speed of about 100Mbps. In the E-UMTS, as a<br>
multiple access technique, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is<br>
mainly concerned in downlink, and a discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM<br>
(DFT-S-OFDM) is mainly concerned in uplink in order to minimize a peak-<br>
to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) of a user equipment (UE).<br>
[3]	FIG. 1 shows a structure of a wireless communication system. The wireless com-<br>
munication system may be have a network stmcture of an E-UMTS. The E-UMTS<br>
may be referred to as a long-term evolution (LTE) system. The wireless com-<br>
munication system can be widely deployed to provide a variety of communication<br>
services, such as voices, packet data, etc.<br>
[4]	Referring to FIG. 1, a E-UMTS is classified into an evolved-UMTS terrstrial radio<br>
access network (E-UTRAN) and an evolved packet core (EPC). The E-UTRAN<br>
includes at least one base station (BS) 20. A user equipment (UE) 10 may be fixed or<br>
mobile, and may be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile station (MS),<br>
a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a wireless device, etc. The BS 20 is<br>
generally a fixed station that conamunicates with the UE 10 and may be referredto as<br>
another terminology, such as an evolved node-B(eNB), a base transceiver system<br>
(BTS), an access point, etc. There are one or more cells within the coverage of the BS<br>
20.<br>
[5]	Interfaces for transmitting user traffic or control traffic may be used between the<br>
BSs 20. Hereinafter, downlink is defined as communication from the BS 20 to the UE<br>
10, and uplink is defined as communication from the UE 10 to the BS 20.<br>
[6]	The BS 20 provides the UE 10 with an end-to-end point of a user plane and a<br><br><br><br>
control plane. The BSs 20 are interconnected by means of an X2 interface, and may<br>
have a meshed network structure in which the X2 interface always exists between the<br>
neighboring BSs 20.<br>
[7]	The BSs 20 are also connected by means of an SI interface to the EPC, more<br>
specifically, to an access gateway (aGW) 30. The aGW 30 provides an end-to-end<br>
point for a session and mobility management fimction of the UE 10. The S1 interface<br>
may be provided between the BS 20 and the aGW 30 so that a plurality of nodes can be<br>
interconnected in a many-to-many manner. The aGW 30 can be classified into a part<br>
for processing user traffic and a part for processing control traffic. In this case, for<br>
inter-communication, a new interface may be used between an aGW for processing<br>
new user traffic and an aGW for processing new control traffic. The aGW 30 is also<br>
referred to as a mobility management entity/user plane entity (MME/UPE).<br>
[8]	Layei's of a radio intert'ace protocol between a UE and a network can be classified<br>
into L1 layer (a first layer), L2 layer (a second layer), and L3 layer (a third layer) based<br>
on the lower three layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) model that is well-<br>
known in a communication system. A physical layer belongs to the first layer and<br>
provides an information transfer service on a physical channel. A radio resource<br>
control (RRC) layer belongs to the third layer and serves to control radio resources<br>
between the UE and the network. The UE and the network exchange RRC messages<br>
via the RRC layer. The RRC layer may be located in network nodes (i.e., a BS, an<br>
aGW, etc.) in a distributed manner, or may be located only in the BS or the aGW.<br>
[9]	The radio interface protocol horizontally includes a physical layer, a data link layer,<br>
and a network layer, and vertically includes a user plane for data infonnation transfer<br>
and a control plane for control signaling delivery.<br>
[10]	FIG. 2 is a diagram showing a control plane of a radio interface protocol. FIG. 3 is a<br>
diagram showing a user plane of the radio interface protocol. In FIGs. 2 and 3, a<br>
structure of the radio interface protocol between a UE and an E-UTRAN is based on<br>
the third generation partnership project (3GPP) wireless access network standard.<br>
[11]	Referring to FIGs. 2 and 3, a physical layer belonging to a first layer provides an<br>
upper layer with an information transfer service on a physical channel. The physical<br>
layer is coupled with a media access control (MAC) layer, i.e., an upper layer of the<br>
physical layer, via a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and<br>
the physical layer on the transport channel. In addition, data is transferred between<br>
different physical layers, i.e., between physical layers of a transmitting side and a<br>
receiving side.<br>
[12]	The MAC layer in a second layer provides services to a radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer, i.e., an upper layer of the MAC layer, via a logical channel. The RLC layer in<br>
the second layer supports reliable data transfer. Functions of the RLC layer can be im-<br><br><br><br>
plemented as a function block included in the MAC layer. In this case, as indicated by<br>
a dotted line, the RLC layer may not exist.<br>
[13]	A packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) belonging to the second layer perfonns<br>
a header compression function. When transmitting an Internet protocol (IP) packet<br>
such as an IPv4 packet or an IPv6 packet, the header of the IP packet may contain<br>
relatively large and unnecessary control information. The PDCP layer reduces the<br>
header size of the IP packet so as to efficiently transmit the IP packet through a radio<br>
interface.<br>
[14]	An RRC layer belonging to a third layer is defined only in the control plane. The<br>
RRC layer serves to control the logical channel, the transport channel, and the physical<br>
channel in association with configuration, reconfiguration, and release of radio bearers<br>
(RBs). An RB is a service provided by the second layer for data transmission between<br>
the UE and the E-UTRAN. The RB is a logical path provided by the first and second<br>
layers of the radio protocol to deliver data between the UE and the E-UTRAN. In<br>
general, when the RB is established, characteristics of radio protocol layers and<br>
channels required to provide a specific service are defined, and all specific parameters<br>
and operation methods are stermined.<br>
[15]	A downlink transport channel transmits data from the network to the UE. Examples<br>
of the downlink transport channel include a broadcast channel (BCH) for transmitting<br>
system information and a downlink-shared channel (DL-SCH) for transmitting user<br>
traffic or control messages. User traffic of downlink multicast or broadcast services or<br>
control messages can be transmitted on the DL-SCH or a downlink multicast channel<br>
(MCH). An uplink transport channel transmits data from the UE to the network.<br>
Examples of the uplink transport channel include a random access channel (RACH) for<br>
transmitting initial control messages and an uplink-shared channel (UL-SCH) for<br>
transmitting user traffic or control messages. A paging channel (PCH) may be<br>
provided to deliver paging information.<br>
[16]	FIG. 4 shows an example of mapping of logical channels onto physical channels in<br>
a WCDMA system. The section 6.1 of 3GPP TS 25.211 V6.7.0 (2005-12) "Technical<br>
Specification Group Radio Access Network; Physical channels and mapping of<br>
transport channels onto physical channels (FDD) (Release 6)" can be incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[17]	Referring to FIG. 4, logical channels are a dedicated channel (DCH), an enhanced<br>
dedicated channel (E-DCH), a random access channel (RACH), a broadcast channel<br>
(BCH), a forward access channel (FACH), a paging channel (PCH), and a high speed<br>
downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH). The logical channels are mapped to various<br>
physical channels.<br>
[18]	FIG. 5 shows an example of mapping of logical channels onto physical channels in<br><br><br><br>
an E-UTRAN. The section 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 36.300 VO.9.0 (2007-03) "Technical<br>
Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network<br>
(E-UTRAN): Overall description; Stage 2 (Release 8)" can be incorporated herein by-<br>
reference.<br>
[19]	Refening to FIG. 5, downlink transport channels (i.e., a DL-SCH, a PCH. and an<br>
MCH) except for a BCH are mapped to a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH).<br>
A control channel among downlink physical channels may be a physical downlink<br>
control channel (PDCCH). Comparing FIG. 4 and HG. 5, unlike the WCDMA system<br>
using various physical channels, the E-UTRAN uses only two downlink physical<br>
channels, i.e., the PDSCH for traffic data and the PDCCH for a control signal.<br>
[20]	In order to receive the PDSCH, a UE first has to monitor the PDCCH. After suc-<br>
cessfully decoding the PDCCH, the UE can receive the PDSCH by using scheduling<br>
information included in the PDCCH. However, since the PDCCH is an almost unique<br>
control channel, the PDCCH is transmitted every transmission time interval (TTI). The<br>
TTI is a unit of scheduling performed by a BS. The TTI is defined as a time for tran<br>
smitting one sub-frame. For example, 1 TTI may be 1ms.<br>
[21]	Unlike the WCDMA system capable of monitoring only a control channel designed<br>
for a specific purpose, the UE in the E-URTAN needs to monitor the PDCCH every<br>
TTI in order to check the scheduling information of the UE. However, when the<br>
scheduling information of the UE is checked every TTI, the UE may experience<br>
significant battery consumption due to a relatively short TTI length.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[22]	A method is sought for monitoiing a control channel to reduce batteiy consumption<br>
of a user equipment.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[23]	In an aspect, a method of monitoring a conti-ol channel in a wireless communication<br>
system is provided. The method includes monitoring a physical downlink control<br>
channel (PDCCH) during a monitored duration, wherein the monitored duration is a<br>
part of a discontinuous reception (DRX) period, the DRX period specifying the<br>
periodic repetition of the monitored duration followed by a non-monitored duration.<br>
[24]	In another aspect, a method of monitoring a control channel in a wireless com-<br>
munication system is provided. The method includes monitoring a PDCCH during a<br>
monitored duration, wherein the monitored duration is a part of a DRX period, the<br>
DRX period specifying the periodic repetition of the monitored duration followed by a<br>
non-monitored duration, and monitoring the PDCCH during an extended period when<br><br><br><br>
the PDCCH is successfully decoded during the monitored duration.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[25]	By monitoring a control channel during a discontinuous reception (DRX) period,<br>
battery consumption of a user equipment (LIE) can be reduced in an evolved-universal<br>
mobile telecommunications system (E-UMTS), and an operation time of the UE can be<br>
increased.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[39]	A user equipment (UE) monitors a downlink control channel during a monitored<br>
duration which exists for each discontinuous reception (DRX) period. The monitored<br>
duration is defined by the number of consecutive transmission time intervals (TTIs).<br>
[40]	Every DRX period, the UE detects whether scheduling information of the UE itself<br>
is transmitted on a downlink control channel during a specific checking period. Upon<br>
detecting the scheduling information, the UE receives data by using the scheduling in-<br>
formation.<br><br><br><br>
[41 ]	During the monitored duration, when no scheduling information of the UE is<br>
received from a base station (BS), the UE does not monitor the downlink control<br>
channel during the remaining cycles of the DRX period.<br>
[42]	When the BS establishes the DRX period of the control channel, every DRX period,<br>
the UE monitors the control channel only during the monitored duration, and stops<br>
monitoring of the control channel during a non-monitored duration.<br>
[43]	When the scheduling information of the UE is detected on the downlink control<br>
channel, that is, when decoding of the downlink control channel is successful, the UE<br>
can continuously monitor the downlink control channel during an extended period<br>
even after the monitored duration is over.<br>
[44]	When the scheduling information of the UE is detected on the downlink control<br>
channel, the UE can enter a continuous reception mode. In the continuous reception<br>
mode, the UE can continuously receive the downlink control channel until a specific<br>
condition is satisfied.<br>
[45]	There may be an occasion in which, after the UE enters the continuous reception<br>
mode from a discontinuous reception mode, the UE re-enters the discontinuous<br>
reception mode from the continuous mode. This occasion may occur when the UE does<br>
not detect the scheduling information of the UE on the downlink control channel<br>
during a specific time period after the UE enters the continuous reception mode.<br>
[46]	Such an occasion may also occur when the UE receives from the BS an instruction,<br>
which allows the UE to enter the discontinuous reception mode, after the UE enters the<br>
continuous reception mode.<br>
[47]	When the scheduling infomiation is detected within the monitored duration, the UE<br>
can extend the monitored duration. The UE can monitor the downlink control channel<br>
for the extended time period even if the monitored duration is over.<br>
[48]	The downlink control channel may be any one of a paging channel and L1/L2<br>
control channel which delivers information regarding on radio resource allocation. The<br>
L1/L2 control channel is also referredto as a physical downlink control channels<br>
(PDCCH). The downlink control channel carries resource allocation information on<br>
which the UE receives data on a downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) or on which the<br>
UE transmits data on an uplink shared channel (UL-SCH). The downlink control<br>
channel carries scheduling assignment information of the UE. Scheduling assignment<br>
may be uplink assignment and/or downlink assignment. When the downlink control<br>
channel is successful decoded, the UE can recognize that the scheduling information of<br>
the UE is being delivered on the downlink control channel.<br>
[49]	The BS can inform the UE of information which indicates whether DRX is<br>
configured to monitor the control channel, information on a DRX period and a<br>
monitored duration, information on an extended period, etc.<br><br><br><br>
[50]	The BS can infonn the UE of configuration information indicating a minimum<br>
possible number of sub-frames (or a time duration) which follow an n-th sub-frame<br>
and in which the UE has to monitor the downlink control channel.<br>
[51]	The BS can inform the UE of information (i.e., configuration information of the<br>
DRX period) on a repetition period of the monitored duration in which the UE<br>
monitors the downlink control channel.<br>
[52]	The BS may monitor the control channel only during the monitored duration of the<br>
DRX period, and inform the UE of DRX configuration infonnation indicating whether<br>
to stop monitoring during the non-monitored duration.<br>
[53]	Upon detecting the scheduling information of the UE. the BS can infom the UE of<br>
information on an extended period in which the DRX period is inactivated and the<br>
downlink control channel is continuously monitored.<br>
[54]	Information on the monitored duration or the extended period may be represented<br>
by a sub-frame to which the downlink control channel is allocated. The information on<br>
the monitored duration or the extended period may be represented by the number of<br>
consecutive sub-frames to be monitored. Alternatively, the infonnation on the<br>
monitored duration or the extended period may be represented by the number of<br>
consecutive TTIs for monitoring the downlink control channel. For example, the<br>
monitored duration is indicated by only one sub-frame, the UE monitors the downlink<br>
control channel only in the one sub-frame. Therefore, if there is data or control in-<br>
fonnation to be transmitted to the UE, the BS has to inform this only on the downlink<br>
control channel allocated to the sub-frame belonging to the monitored duration.<br>
However, when the system experiences power shortage, or when a large amount of<br>
data has to be transmitted to another user, the BS has to give up data transmission of<br>
another user in order to infonn the UE of the existence of data. That is, when only one<br>
sub-frame is included in the monitored duration of the UE, the BS experiences<br>
significant limits in utilizing radio resources. Therefore, it is effective to define a<br>
plurality of consecutive sub-frames (or a plurality of TTIs) in the monitored duration<br>
or the extended period.<br>
[55]	FIG. 6 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[56]	Referring to FIG. 6, a DRX period has a length of 7 TTIs, and a monitored duration<br>
has a length of 2 TTIs. The remaining cycles of the DRX period, that is. a non-<br>
monitored duration, have a length of 7 TTIs. The length of the monitored duration is<br>
defined by the number of consecutive TTIs. The TTI is a unit of scheduling radio<br>
resources. The TTI is a time required to transmit one sub-frame. At least one PDCCH<br>
and at least one physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) can be allocated to one<br>
sub-frame.<br><br><br><br>
[57]	A BS can inform a UE of the length of the monitored duration. The monitored<br>
duration is a part of the DRX period. The DRX period specifies periodic repetition of<br>
the monitored duration followed by the non-monitored duration.<br>
[58]	Eveiy DRX period, the UE monitors at least one PDCCH during the monitored<br>
duration. The PDCCH is a control channel carrying scheduling assignment (e.g.,<br>
uplink assignment or downlink assignment). If decoding is not successfully performed<br>
on the PDCCH during the monitored duration, the UE stops the monitoring of the<br>
PDCCH during the non-monitored duration. The BS can infonn the UE of information<br>
(i.e., DRX configuration) indicating whether the PDCCH is monitored during the non-<br>
monitored duration.<br>
[59]	The UE monitors the PDCCH during the monitored duration. The UE may wake up<br>
only during the monitored duration to perform uplink transmission or downlink<br>
transmission. For example, the UE may periodicaUy report a channel quality indicator<br>
(CQI) to the BS during the monitored duration.<br>
[60]	FIG. 7 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[61]	Refening to FIG. 7, every DRX period, a UE monitors a PDCCH during a<br>
monitored duration. When decoding is successfully performed on the PDCCH during<br>
the monitored duration, that is, when data to be transmitted to the UE is detected, data<br>
on a DL-SCH is received by using information indicated on the PDCCH.<br>
[62]	When the UE successfully receives the PDCCH on which uplink assignment or<br>
downlink assignment is indicated during the monitored duration, the PDCCH can be<br>
monitored during an extended period. In this example, data is indicated at 2 TTIs, and<br>
the monitored duration is further extended. If the PDCCH is not successfully decoded<br>
during the extended period, the UE re-enters the DRX period. The BS can inform the<br>
UE of infonnation on the extended period.<br>
[63]	FIG. 8 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according to<br>
an embodiment of the present mvention.<br>
[64]	Refening to FIG. 8, a DRX period is divided into an on-period and an off-period.<br>
The on-period is a period in which a UE monitors a PDCCH. The off-period is a period<br>
in which the UE stops monitoring the PDCCH and enters DRX sleep mode. A BS can<br>
inform the UE of information on the on-period or the off-period. When the UE suc-<br>
cessfully receives the PDCCH during the off-period, downlink data can be recei\ed on<br>
a DL-SCH.<br>
[65]	The on-period is defined by the number of consecutive TTIs. The off-period may<br>
also be defined by the number of consecutive TTIs.<br>
[66]	The on-period and the off-period may have fixed lengths. That is, during the on-<br>
period, the UE may do not change the length of the on-period or the off-period even if<br><br><br><br>
scheduling information is detected on the PDCCH. In this case, the on-period and the<br>
off-period of the UE have invariable lengths. Therefore, when the on-period is over,<br>
the UE transitions to the off-period regardless of whether transmission information is<br>
received during the on-period. That is, although the PDCCH has been successfully<br>
received at the first 2 TTIs, the UE does not monitor the PDCCH during the off-period,<br>
starting from a time point when the off-period begins.<br>
[67]	FIG. 9 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[68]	Refening to FIG. 9, a BS instructs a UE to skip an off-period during a specific<br>
DRX period. Scheduling information may not be received within a previous on-period<br>
due to a large amount of data or control information to be sent from the BS to the UE.<br>
In this case, it can be instructed such that the off-period of the specific DRX period is<br>
skipped during the specific DRX period, and thus a current mode can be switched to a<br>
continuous reception mode only during the specific DRX period. Alternatively, in this<br>
case, it can be instructed such that the UE switches the current mode to continuously<br>
receive data by stopping DRX configuration. "When the instruction for skipping the off-<br>
period is received, the UE does not enter the off-period and performs an operation in<br>
the on-period amounting to the skipped periods of time.<br>
[69]	FIG. 10 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[70]	Refening to FIG. 10, when a PDCCH is successfully decoded during an on-period<br>
of a specific DRX period, the PDCCH can be further monitored for a time period<br>
amounting to an extended period. The extended period is defined by the number of<br>
consecutive TTIs for monitoring the PDCCH when downlink transmission is expected.<br>
Herein, the PDCCH is successfully decoded during an on-period having a length of 2<br>
TTIs, and the PDCCH is monitored during an extended period having a length of 2<br>
TTIs. Therefore, a total length of the monitored duration is 4 TTIs.<br>
[71]	While receiving the downlink control channel during the on-period, when<br>
scheduling assignment (e.g., downlink assignment or uplink assignment) of the UE is<br>
detected on the downlink control channel, the UE further monitors the PDCCH for a<br>
time period amounting to the extended peiiod. If the PDCCH is not successfully<br>
decoded during the extended period, the UE re-enters the DRX period.<br>
[72]	The BS can instruct the UE to switch to a continuous reception mode continuously<br>
during an on-period in a next DRX period, or sv\itch to the continuous reception mode<br>
only during se\eral DRX periods, or extends a length of the on-period. Even after the<br>
UE switches to the continuous reception mode, the BS can instruct the UE to transition<br>
to the off-period. While staying in the continuous reception mode, when the BS<br>
instructs the UE to transition to the off-period, the UE ends the continuous reception<br><br><br><br>
mode and transitions to the off-period.<br>
[73]	FIG. 11 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[74J	Referring to FIG. 11, when a PDCCH is successfully decoded during an on-period,<br>
a UE inactivates an off-period, and further monitors the PDCCH for a time period<br>
amounting to an extended period. A BS can instruct the UE to transition to the off-<br>
period during the extended period. That is, the UE can enter a DRX period directly<br>
under the instruction of the BS instead of entering the DRX period after the extended<br>
period is over.<br>
[75]	FIG. 12 shows an example of a method of monitoring a control channel according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[76]	Referring to FIG. 12, when data is indicated, a plurality of extended periods exist.<br>
That is, when a PDCCH is successfully decoded during an on-period, a UE further<br>
monitors the PDCCH during an extended period. If the PDCCH is successfully<br>
decoded only during the extended period, the UE continuously monitors the PDCCH<br>
during an additionally extended period. When data is indicated during an on-period,<br>
the PDCCH can be continuously monitored during a plurality of extended periods after<br>
the on-period of a corresponding DRX period is over.<br>
[77]	After receiving the data indication, the UE continuously monitors the PDCCH<br>
during the extended period in order to receive subsequent downlink transmission.<br>
When data indication is received again, the UE continuously monitors again the<br>
PDCCH during another extension period. If existence of data is no longer indicated<br>
during the additional extension period, the UE re-enters the DRX period.<br>
[78]	Although the control channel is transmitted at a relatively short transmission period,<br>
the UE monitors the control channel only during the on-period and does not monitor<br>
the control channel during the off-period. The BS can inform the UE of DRX con-<br>
figuration by using a media access control (MAC) message or a radio resource control<br>
(RRC) message. When the control channel is monitored by using a DRX method,<br>
battery consumption of the UE can be reduced.<br>
[79]	FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing constimtional elements of a UE. A UE 50<br>
includes a processor 51, a memory 52, a radio frequency (RF) unit 53, a display unit<br>
54, and a user interface unit 55. The memoiy 52 is coupled to the processor 51 and<br>
stores an operating system, applications, and general files. The display unit 54 displays<br>
a variety of information of the UE 50 and may use a well-known element such as a<br>
liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED). etc. The user<br>
interface unit 55 can be configured with a combination of well-known user interfaces<br>
such as a keypad, a touch screen, etc. The RF unit 53 is coupled to the processor 51<br>
and transmits and/or receives radio signals.<br><br><br><br>
[80]	Layers of the radio interface protocol are implemented in the processor 51. The<br>
processor 51 provides a control plane and a user plane. A monitoring function of the<br>
control channel can be implemented in the processor 51.<br>
[81J	The steps of a method described in connection with the embodiments disclosed<br>
