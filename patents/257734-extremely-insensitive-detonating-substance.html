				<td>EXTREMELY INSENSITIVE DETONATING SUBSTANCE AND METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an explosive composition of substantially reduced sensitivity and low flammability and a method for its manufacture. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with an explosive composition definable as an extremely insensitive detonating substance (E1DS) according to UN Regulations for the Transport of Dangerous Goods (often referred to as the 'orange book'), classified in Class 1.5D.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
High performance explosive compositions are long known. It has been a goal for researchers to find new explosive compositions which can be defined as low impact and shock sensitivity and low flammability, nevertheless offer high energy explosive performance. A combination of these properties offers higher survivability when applied in armor modules as well as greater transportation and handling safety, whilst not deteriorating the overall performance, when compared to readily available explosive compositions of similar energetic properties.<br>
One example of low-flammability explosive compositions is disclosed in US Patent No. 4.861.397 to Hillstrom disclosing a material comprising an explosive in an amount of 41-85%, an additive selected from the group consisting of zinc borate, hexabromobiphcnyl molybdenum flame suppressant, triaryl phosphate ester, calcium formate, antimony oxide,, ammonium phosphate, aluminum oxide trihydrate, and organophosphorous diols in an amount of 9-41% and a binder component selected from the group consisting of polyurethane. acrylic polymers, phosphate ester-vinyl chloride latexes, cellulose acetate butyrate, vinyl esters, styrene-ethylene butylene block copolymers fluorinated<br>
elastomers, and Plaster of Paris rubberized with acrylic latexes in an amount of 6-39%. all of proportions being on a % by weight basis.<br>
US Patent No. 5,080.735 to Wagner discloses a cap-sensitive flexible explosive composition of reduced flammability comprising a finely divided cap-sensitive explosive in a flame resistant polymeric binder system which comprises a fluorinated elastomer, or mixture of fluorinated elastomers, admixed with from about 10% to about 30% by weight of a compatible flame rctardant material, a drip suppressant, and optionally a cross-linking activator whereby the binder system when exposed to heat from an ignition source will crosslink and harden at a rate which is faster than the rate at which the explosive composition will burn. This material is commercially available and is known as LF-2.<br>
The composition disclosed in the '735 Patent is concerned, as stated above, with a cap-sensitive composition. The term 'cap-sensitive' composition •denotes a substance detonable when subjected to ignition by a so-called No. 8 detonator at unconilned substance conditions, i.e. a substance classified in Class 1.1D according to UN Regulations for the Transport of Dangerous Goods.<br>
The explosive composition, provided between plates of a cassette of a reactive armor module, causes the plates to displace as result of detonation, and thus scatter (break) the jet caused by a warhead hitting the reactive armor module. Some major problems associated with reactive armors arise from the use of excessively sensitive and flammable explosive compositions. Excessive flammability can lead to ignition of the explosive even by small or medium caliber threats. In case the explosive composition bums, a potentially dangerous result may ensue e.g. for a vehicle's crew, because burning of the confined explosive composition may cause detonation, creating some serious hazards for personnel in the vicinity of the vehicle. Moreover, burning increases both the visual and thermal signature of the protected vehicle and further, the fire is likely to consume the entire explosive in the particular armor tile and may even spread<br>
to adjacent tiles. Obviously, a reactive • armor tile in which the explosive composition has burnt, offers no protection against shaped charge threats.<br>
Other explosive compositions are not fully satisfactory and are either too impact sensitive or shock sensitive and thus may burn and/or detonate at some undesired conditions and further may have unsatisfactory physical or mechanical properties, or suffer from difficulties and limitations in their preparation and application.<br>
It is thus the purpose of the present invention to provide an explosive composition of substantially reduced impact/shock sensitivity and low flammability, which composition is classified in Class 1.5D according to UN regulation, i.e. a composition definable as an extremely insensitive detonating substance (EIDS), and the preparation of which is substantially simple.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an explosive composition having significantly low sensitivity, low flammability and a high sell-extinguishing rate, such that it is detonable only under extremely high pressure/energy conditions, e.g. striking of a jet warhead, and offers high performance as compared to readily available explosive compositions of similar energetic properties. The present invention is also concerned with a method for manufacturing such an explosive composition and applications for use of said composition.<br>
The composition according to the present invention is of substantially low flammability, i.e. it is not easily ignitable by conventional means (such as black powder, small arms, projectiles, shrapnel, etc.), however once ignited its burning rate is significantly low (almost as a passive material) and its self extinguishing rate is significantly high. In any event, the probability of buming-to-detonation-transition is negligible.<br>
The composition according to the present invention is of substantially low sensitivity, i.e. complies with test series 3. 5. and 6 according to the UN regulations. For example, the composition according to the present invention is not cap-sensitive (test 5(a)) even under confined conditions, non-ignitable in deflagration-to-detonation-transition (DDT) test (test 5(b)) and reacts as a passive material in external fire test (test 6(c)).<br>
In light of the above, the composition according to the present invention is classified in Class 1.5D (EIDS) according to UN regulation.<br>
According to the present invention the explosive composition comprises one or more explosive materials, one or more fire retardant materials and a binder and optionally, some other additives for obtaining various desired properties.<br>
In accordance with the present invention a volumetric percentage of the components in the explosive composition are in the following ranges, as follows:<br>
Explosive material/s	42-58% vol.<br>
Fire retardant/s	 15-26% vol<br>
Binder	20-36% vol<br>
The explosive material/s may be selected from a group comprising pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX and reduced sensitivity RDX), cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX and reduced sensitivity HMX), trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitrotriazolone (NTO), CL-20, FOX-7 and any other such explosive, or mixtures thereof. The one or more raw explosive materials may be in several granulations chosen according to the desired final properties of the explosive composition.<br>
The fire retardant may be selected from a group comprising boron containing compounds such as zinc borate, boric acid, ammonium tluoroborate etc.; phosphorus containing compounds such as phosphate esters, ammonium<br>
polyphosphate, etc.; halogen containing inorganic compounds or hydrocarbon compounds, such as decabromodiphenyl oxide (DBDPO). with or without radical stabilizers, such as antimony oxide; hydrated materials, such as alumina trihydrate (ATH), magnesium dehydrate, etc., and any other such fire retardants known in the art or mixtures thereof.<br>
The binder may be a thermoplastic or thermosetic polymer. The binder may be selected from a group comprising thermoplastic polymers, such as Hstane , Kraton™, Fluorel , Viton™ etc., or a group of thermosetic polymers, such as polyurcthanes (e.g. H'l'PB, Desmophen™, etc.), polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), etc.<br>
In compliance with US laws and regulations any plastic bonded explosive (PBX) must contain a taggent agent (for detection by security sniffers) and thus, the explosive composition according to the present invention may contain a taggent agent selected from a group comprising Ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), 2,3-Dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMDNB), para-Mononitrotoluene (p-MNT), and ortho-Mononitrotoluene (o-MNT), etc.<br>
Optionally, coloring agents (pigments) may be added to the composition for differentiation purposes between different compositions. The pigment may be in powder or liquid form.<br>
It is also possible to add to the compositions of the invention cross-linking inhibitors (or pot-life extenders), such as aliphatic phosphates. A suitable pot-life extender is, e.g. tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (EHP).<br>
Depending on the selection of the fire retardant materials, the composition according to the present invention produces burning and explosive products which are not more toxic than burning and explosion products of conventional explosives. For example, acidic gasses such as HC1 or HBr are not emitted during burning or explosion of the explosive composition but rather, regular burning gasses are emitted such as NOx, carbon oxides, etc.<br>
Furthermore, the raw materials used for preparation of the explosive composition are substantially non toxic, and in any case those materials which may be considered as hazardous, such as the cross-linking inhibitor and the catalyst, are at significantly low quantities in the composition.<br>
An important feature of the explosive composition in accordance with the present invention is that quantitative reverse analysis for providing the exact content of the raw materials in the composition is practically not possible or substantially complicated.<br>
The present invention is further concerned with a method for manufacturing of an explosive composition in accordance with the invention as will be disclosed hereinafter. It is appreciated that granulations and ratios of the powdered materials have significant influence on the mechanical properties of the final explosive composition, namely flexibility, strength, strain hardness, etc, The granulation ratio defines the compactability of the powdered components in the composition and thus reflects on the mechanical properties of the final product.<br>
The explosive composition in accordance with the present invention is thus characterized by the following features:<br>
•	the composition offers similar explosive performance (efficiency)<br>
as of other known explosive compositions (e.g.  for Explosive<br>
Reactive Armor (ERA))<br>
•	the explosive composition is classified in Class 1.5D according to<br>
UN Classification, i.e. the material is defined as an extremely<br>
insensitive detonating substance (E1DS);<br>
•	the burning time is shorter (i.e. the extinguishing rate is high) than<br>
heretofore known low flammability compositions;<br>
•	the composition is cheaper than heretofore similar compositions<br>
owing to the ingredients used and the method for its manufacture;<br><br>
•	the explosive composition in accordance with the present invention<br>
is easily machined (by hand or by machine) to cut. pierce, fold,<br>
etc.. and is easily applied;<br>
•	the explosive composition in accordance with the present invention<br>
is   substantially   durable   to   environmental   conditions   such  as<br>
temperature and humidity changes. It is water and other liquid<br>
substances resistant (e.g. oil, fuel, etc.), and retains its properties<br>
also after long periods of time at room temperature (above 10<br>
years), and at 70°C for at least three months;<br>
•	the explosive composition according to the present invention may<br>
be manufactured into flexible or rigid form, depending on the<br>
intended use and purpose.<br>

DETA1LED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The composition according to the present invention is of substantially low flammability. i.e. it is not easily ignitable by conventional means (such as small arms, projectiles, shrapnel, black powder, etc.), however once ignited its burning rate is significantly low (almost as a passive material) and in any case its self extinguishing rate is significantly high. In any event, the probability of burning-to-detonation-transition is negligible.<br>
The following are examples of compositions of explosive compositions in accordance with the present invention, wherein percentages of ingredients are indicated in percent volume.<br>
Explosive material	42-58% vol.;<br>
Fire retardant	 15-26% vol.;<br>
Binder	 20-36% vol.<br>
The explosive material may be a homogenous explosive material or may consist of two or more materials. For example, RDX and HMX in 10:1 ratio may be used.<br>
The fire retardant may be selected from a group comprising of boron containing compounds such as zinc borate, boric acid, ammonium fluoroborate etc.; phosphorus containing compounds such as phosphate esters, ammonium polyphosphate, etc.; halogen containing inorganic compounds or hydrocarbon compounds, such as decabromodiphenyl oxide (DBDPO), with or without radical stabilizers, such as antimony oxide; hydrated materials, such as aluminum trihydrate (ATH). magnesium dehydrate, etc.. and any other such fire retardants known in the art or mixtures thereof.<br>
The binder may be a thermoplastic or thermosetic polymer. The binder may be selected from a group comprising of thermoplastic polymers, such as EstaneIM, Kraton'M, Fluorel1M, Viton]M etc., or a group of thermosetic polymers, such as polyurethanes (e.g. HTPB, Desmophen™, etc.), polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), etc. According to one particular embodiment, the binder comprises<br>
PDMS (between about 88-95% weight), a cross-linking agent (between about 5-10% weight) and a catalyst (between about 0.05-0.2% weight). The binder typically comprises a cross-linking inhibitor such as tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate (EHP) in a typical amount of 0.3-1.5%weight.<br>
The taggent agent may be selected from a group comprising, among others, Ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), 2,3-Dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMDNB), para-Mononitrotoluene (p-MNT), and ortho-Mononitrotoluene (o-MNT), etc.<br>
The method for manufacturing of an explosive composition in accordance with the present invention comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	drying  powdered  explosive  materials   in  a  specially  designed<br>
explosive proof oven for explosive powders;<br>
b)	weighing raw materials:<br>
c)	mixing the raw materials, e.g. in a sigma mixer or a planetary<br>
mixer, as known per se, thereby obtaining a dough;<br>
d)	removal of residual air from the dough to thereby avoid presence of<br>
air voids in the final product. This is obtained under vacuum and<br>
the composition is then compressed through a nozzle having a<br>
desired shape, e.g. cord shaped, flat paste form, etc.;<br>
e)	cross-linking the composition in an oven at 50-70°C to harden the<br>
composition. This stage, however, may be omitted to thereby retain<br>
the composition as a dough for different applications e.g. where the<br>
final product is to be injected in its use;<br>
f)	forming the hardened composition to a desired final shape.<br>
It is appreciated that different levels of cross-linking may be performed in order to obtain different levels of flexibility of the final product. While cross-linking, the chemical, sensitivity and energetic properties of the composition are not affected, but rather only the mechanical properties of the resultant product.<br>
It is further appreciated that the explosive composition obtained after the compressing stage through the shaped nozzle (step d) may be of any desired form. For example, for use in reactive armor modules, sheets of material are required. In this case, the paste obtained after step d) is pressed using spacers so as to obtain material at a desired and uniform thickness.<br>
Furthermore, forming the final material, i.e. cutting and piercing of the final composition obtained at step e) may be carried out by mechanical means, e.g. using a water jet or different types of presses or rollers, or, alternatively, it may be carried out manually, using simple means such a scissors, knives, mold templates punches, etc.<br>
When the composition is to be used as an exploding cord for example, to cut/sheer pillars, pipes, etc., the explosive composition is formed in the shape of a flexible cord.<br>
The explosive composition according to the present invention may be modified, and the following are different examples:<br>
Example 2:<br>
explosive material - RDX 	55%vol,<br>
ATH	20%voL<br>
PDMS 	25%vol,<br>
pigment	0.05%vol,<br>
taggent (e.g. DMDNB)	0.18%vol.<br>
Example 3<br>
explosive material - RDX 	46%vol.<br>
explosive material - HMX	4%vol.<br>
boric acid	25%vol,<br>
PDMS	25%vol,<br>
pigment	0.05%vol,<br><br>
taggent (e.g. DMDNB)	0.2%vol.<br>
Example 4<br>
explosive material - RDX 	48%vol.<br>
explosive material - HMX	6%vol.<br>
boric acid	22%vol,<br>
PDMS	24%vol,<br>
pigment	0.05%vol,<br>
taggent(e.g. DMDNB)	0.18%vol.<br>
The following table illustrates the differences between the compositions of the above examples, as reflected in ballistic (armor) and bullet impact sensitivity test results.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
It is further appreciated that the granulation ratios of the raw powdered materials, in particular the explosive materials and the solid fire retardants, influence only the mechanical properties of the resultant composition, namely, flexibility, strength, stain, hardness, etc.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 1, there is illustrated a graph representing the efficiency (in an armor module) of different explosive compositions versus their survivability/safety. As may be noted the explosive composition in accordance with the present invention, identified as LBR-6, shows significantly high efficiency with reasonable survivability/safety as compared with other compositions for explosive reactive armor (ERA). The composition identified as<br>
LF-2, which is available in the market, shows similar survivability in an armor module as of the LBR-6 though its safety is lower than that of LBR-6: LF-2 is classified according to the aforementioned UN regulations under Class 1.1D. while LBR-6 is classified under Class 1.5D.<br>
Self-Limiting ERA (SLERA) comprises an energetic material/explosive layer in armor module, which can provide good multiple-hit capability in modular configuration. The energetic material/explosive used in SLERA is not as effective as fully detonable explosives. This material can be classified under Class 1.5D or potentially be excluded from Class 1 (not an explosive).<br>
Non-Explosive Reactive Armor (NxRA) has comparable efficiency to SLERA, though the energetic material in NxRA is not an explosive (not in Class 1). The survivability of NxRA is good, ant it has good multiple-hit capability against hollow charge warheads.<br>
Non-Energetic Reactive Armor (NERA) has limited efficiency against hollow charges and is totally passive, thus provides excellent survivability and maximal multiple-hit capability. In this type of armor module, the material layer in the cassette is not energetic at all, e.g. rubber, glass, etc.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 2 there is a schematic representation of a bullet impact sensitivity test setup illustrating a barrel 14 aimed to fire rounds of 14.5mm small arms at a sandwich-like element 16 containing an 8mm thick layer of tested composition 18 (the energetic material or explosive) displaced between two steel plates 20 and 21 (2mm and 6.4mm thick, respectively). The sandwich-like element 16 is positioned at a typical standoff of 7 to 10m in compliance with the UN regulations and is inclined horizontally at about 30°. The following Table 1 represents bullet impact sensitivity test results at room temperature for different explosives applied in such a sandwich-like assembly.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 1: bullet impact sensitivity tests<br><br>
The term burning probability denotes the likelihood of ignition of the explosive in the sandwich-like element 16 upon striking by a 14.5mm round. The data presented in Table 1, under "burning probability" indicates the number of burning incidents out of 10 rounds fired. The term burning duration denotes the burning time of the 8mm explosive layer in the sandwich-like element 16 once ignited upon striking by a 14.5mm round.<br>
In case of striking element 16 by smaller arms, such as 0.5" rounds, the burning probability of LF-2 and LBR-6 becomes zero (0/10), while for C-4 it is higher (4/10).<br>
Turning now to Figs. 3 to 5 there are illustrated photographs of several safety test setups and their respective results, according to the UN regulations.<br>
Fig. 3A is the setup of cap-sensitivity test (standard UN regulations (test 5(a)) showing a polyurethane cylinder 22 of standard dimensions containing LBR-6 explosive 23 with a No. 8 detonator 24 received there within in the center. The cylinder is positioned on a steel witness plate 26 placed over supports 27 which in turn rest on a heavy steel plate (40 mm thick) 29. A successful test result for a cap-sensitivity test is no penetration of the witness plate 26, as can be seen in Fig. 3B after ignition of the detonator 24. As can further be seen in Fig. 3B the explosive composition 23 is only mechanically scattered (i.e. no detonation occurred) such that most of the explosive remains intact in the cylinder. The other part of the cylinder was found outside of the cylinder after the test. Even more so the witness plate 26, shown on the left side of the picture, remains un-indented. The cylinder 22 is partially ripped owing to the detonation<br>
of the No. 8 detonator 24. The above results were repeated using a steel cylinder instead of polyurethane cylinder, considered as confined conditions which are much more severe (not shown).<br>
Fig. 4A illustrates a deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) test setup (standard UN regulations (test 5(b)), wherein a steel cylinder 30 is filled with the tested LBR-6 explosive 32. The bottom end of the cylinder 30 is welded to a steel whiteness plate 36. A detonator 38 is received within 5 grams of black powder 40 supported by a plastic container 42 within the tested explosive composition, with an electric cord 44 extending from the detonator 38 through a sealing cap 34 screwed coupled to seal an opposed end of cylinder 30.<br>
A successful test result for a DDT test is no penetration of the witness plate 36 due to detonation of the explosive 32. As can be seen in Fig. 4B the witness plate 36 is sheered due to pressure built up in the cylinder 30 but no penetration occurred as result of detonation. Moreover, the cylinder 30 and the cap 34 remained whole (undamaged) and most of the explosive was found after the test, 50% remains intact in the cylinder and the rest of it was found beside the cylinder.<br>
Fig. 5A illustrates an external fire test setup (standard UN regulations (test 6(c)) wherein five cardboard boxes 54 filled with ISOKgs. of the tested LBR-6 explosive 56 (a total volume of 0.15nr in compliance with the UN regulations) are mounted on a rack 58 placed in a Kerosene reservoir 60 of 1500 liters. The Kerosene is remotely ignited resulting in a total burning of the boxes 54 containing the explosive composition 56.<br>
As is illustrated in Fig. 5B after complete burning of the explosive composition during 1 hour, remainders of the explosive composition 56 are visible. These results indicate a low burning rate of the LBR-6 explosive. Furthermore, in such a test the burning of the LBR-6 explosive was non-violent (calm), i.e. throwing flames at a diameter of approx. 30cm. in average.<br>
The safety test results obtained in the tests exemplified in Figs. 3 to 5 indicate an explosive composition qualifying as a Class 1.5D according to UN regulations for the transport of dangerous goods.<br>
The composition obtained according to the present invention may be used. according to one of its applications, as an explosive composition in an explosive reactive armor (ERA) module, applied on combat vehicles etc.<br>

Thus, it should be understood that numerous additional embodiments are within the scope of the invention, mutatis mutandis.<br>
