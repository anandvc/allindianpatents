				<td>METHOD OF BULK TRANSPORT AND STORAGE OF GAS IN A LIQUID MEDIUM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to storage and transportation of produced or natural gas<br>
or other gases, and specifically to the bulk handling of natural gas, vapor phase hydrocarbons,<br>
or other gases in a liquid medium; and to its segregation into a gaseous phase for delivery into<br>
storage or into gas transmission pipelines. As described herein, the present invention is<br>
particularly applicable to ship or barge installation for marine transportation and to on board<br>
gas processing, but is equally applicable to ground modes of transportation such as rail,<br>
trucking and land storage systems for natural gas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural gas is predominantly transported and handled by pipeline as a gaseous medium<br>
or in the form of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) in ships or peak shaving facilities. Many gas<br>
reserves are remotely located with respect to markets, and of a size smaller than the levels of<br>
recoverable product deemed economically worthwhile moving to market by pipeline or<br>
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ships.<br>
The slow commercialization of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) shipping offering<br>
volumetric containment of natural gas up to half of the 600 to 1 ratio offered by LNG has<br>
shown the need for a method which is complimentary to both these aforementioned systems.<br>
The method described herein is intended to fulfill the existing need between these two systems.<br>
The energy intensity of LNG systems typically requires 10 to 14 % of the energy<br>
content of produced gas by the time the product is delivered to market hubs. CNG has even<br>
higher energy requirements associated with gas conditioning, heat of compression of the gas,<br>
its cooling and subsequent evacuation from transport containers. As outlined in US Patent<br>
application No. 10/928,757 ("the 757 application), filed August 26,2004, which is<br>
incorporated by reference, the handling of natural gas in a liquefied matrix as a liquid medium<br>
(referred to as Compressed Gas Liquid™ (CGL™) gas mixture) without resorting to cryogenic<br>
conditions has its advantages in this niche market. Both in the compression of gas to a liquid<br>
phase for storage conditions, and in the 100% displacement of CGL™ gas mixture during<br>
offloading from transportation systems, there are distinct energy demand advantages in the<br>
CGL™ process.<br>
The CGL™ process energy demand to meet storage conditions of 1400 psig at -40 °F is<br>
a moderate requirement. The higher pressures necessary for effective values of CNG (1800<br>
1<br><br>
for LNG (-260 °F) give rise to the greater energy demands for the CNG and LNG processes.<br>
Thus it is desirable to provide systems and methods that facilitate the storage and<br>
transport of natural or produced gas with lower energy demands.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to a means mounted on marine transport vessel, such<br>
as a ship or barge, for loading a production gas stream, separating heavier hydrocarbons,<br>
compressing the gas, cooling the gas, drying the gas with a liquid or solid desiccant, blending<br>
the gas with a liquid carrier or solvent, and then cooling the mix to processing, storage and<br>
transportation conditions. After transporting the product to its destination, a hydrocarbon<br>
processing train and liquid displacement method is provided to unload the liquid from the<br>
pipeline and storage system, separate the liquid carrier, and transfer the gas stream to the<br>
custody of typically a shore storage or transmission system.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a self contained ship or barge includes a processing, storage<br>
and transportation system that converts natural gas, or vapor phase hydrocarbons into a<br>
liquefied medium using a liquid solvent mixture of Ethane, Propane, and Butane, the<br>
composition and volume of which is specifically determined according to the service<br>
conditions and limits of efficiency of the particular solvent, as indicated in the '757 application.<br>
The process train is also devised to unload the natural gas product or vapor phase hydrocarbon<br>
from the ship mounted pipeline system, segregating and storing the liquid solvent for reuse<br>
with the next shipment.<br>
The method described herein is not limited to ship installation and is suited to other<br>
forms of transportation with or without the process train installed on the transport medium. The<br>
application is particularly suitable for the retrofit of existing tankers or for use with newly built<br>
ships.<br>
The loading sequence preferably begins with a natural or production gas flowing from a<br>
subsea wellhead, FPSO, offshore platform or shore based pipeline through a loading pipeline<br>
connected directly or indirectly to the ship through a buoy or mooring dock. The gas flows<br>
through a manifold to a two or three phase gas separator to remove free water and heavy<br>
hydrocarbons from the gas stream.<br>
The process train conditions the gas stream for removal of any undesirable components<br>
as well as heavy hydrocarbons in a scrubber. The gas is then compressed, cooled and scrubbed<br>
to near storage pressure — preferably to about 1100 psig to 1400 psig. The gas is then dried<br>
using a liquid or solid desiccant, e.g., a methanol-water mixture or molecular sieve, for hydrate<br>
2<br><br>
liquid solvent-gas mixture stream is then cooled through a refrigeration system to storage<br>
temperature of about - 40°F.<br>
The dehydration of the gas is carried out to prevent the formation of gas hydrates. Upon<br>
exiting the gas chillers, the hydrocarbon and aqueous solution is separated to remove the<br>
aqueous phase components and the now dry liquid solvent-gas mixture stream is loaded into a<br>
storage pipe system at storage conditions.<br>
The stored product is kept in banks of bundled pipes, interconnected via manifolds in<br>
such a manner that the contents of each bank can be selectively isolated or re-circulated<br>
through a looped pipe system which in turn is connected to a refrigeration system in order to<br>
maintain the storage temperature continuously during the transit period.<br>
The offloading sequence involves displacement of the contents of the pipe system by a<br>
methanol-water mixture. The stored liquid solvent-gas mixture's pressure is reduced to the<br>
region of about 400 psig prior to its entry, as a two phase hydrocarbon stream, to a de-ethanizer<br>
tower. A mixture composed predominately of methane and ethane gas emerges from the top of<br>
the tower to be compressed and cooled to transmission pipeline specification pressure and<br>
temperature in the offloading line. From the base of the de-ethanizer tower flows a stream<br>
composed predominately of propane and heavier components that is fed to a de-propanizer<br>
tower.<br>
From the top of this vessel, a propane stream is fed back into storage ready for the next<br>
gas shipment, while from the bottom of the tower a butane rich stream is pumped back into the<br>
methane/ethane stream flowing in the offloading line to bring the gas heating value back to par<br>
with that of the originally loaded production stream. This process also has the ability to adjust<br>
the BTU value of the sales gas stream to meet the BTU value requirements of the customer.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The details of the present invention are described below in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying figures, which are schematic only and not to scale. For exemplary purposes<br>
only, the following description focuses on ship or marine use. However, one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will readily recognize that the present invention is not constrained as described here<br>
to ship use and for marine transport, but is equally applicable to ground modes such as rail,<br>
trucking and land storage systems for natural gas.<br>
In preferred embodiments, storage pressures are set at levels below 2150 psig and<br>
temperatures set as low as -80°F. At these preferred pressures and temperature, the effective<br>
storage densities for natural or produced gas within a liquid matrix advantageously exceed<br>
those of CNG. For reduced energy demand, the preferred storage pressure and temperature are<br>
preferably in a range of about 1400 psig and preferably in a range of about -40°F<br>
As depicted in Figure 4A, a looped pipeline system 20, which is located in the cargo<br>
compartments 30 of a tanker 10, is used to contain the transported liquefied production or<br>
natural gas mixture. The pipeline system 20 is contained within an insulated cargo hold 30 of<br>
the ship or tanker 10. The cargo hold 30 is covered with an insulated hood 12 holding a chilled<br>
inert atmosphere 14 that surrounds the pipeline system 20. In a preferred embodiment, as<br>
depicted in Figures 4B and 4C, the loading process equipment 100 and the separation,<br>
fractionation and unloading process equipment 300 are mounted on the side deck of the tanker<br>
10 to provide an integrated system.<br>
4<br><br>
depicted in figure 2B, is designed with vertically oriented<br>
pipes or pipe banks 22 that are designed to be serviced from the top 24 or the bottom 26 side of<br>
the pipes 22. The pipes 22, which can be skirt or skirtless, preferably include topside 24 or<br>
bottom side 26 mounted hardware for maximized use of space in vertical placement. The<br>
containment pipes 22 of the pipeline system 20 also preferably include vent and fitting free<br>
bases to minimize corrosion and inspection needs in tightly packed cargo holds.<br>
Introduction and extraction of a gas mixture is preferably via a cap mounted pipe<br>
connection for the upper level of the pipes 22, and a cap mounted dip tube (stinger) pipe<br>
reaching near the bottom of the pipes 22 to service the lower level of the pipe section. This is<br>
done so that fluid displacement activity in the pipe preferably has the higher density product<br>
introduced from the lower level and lighter density product removed from the upper level. The<br>
vertical dip tube is preferably utilized for the filling, displacement and circulation processes.<br>
Turning to Figures 5B and 5C, alternative pipeline systems 20 are provided where the<br>
pipes or pipe banks 22 are oriented horizontally. As depicted in Figure 5B, the fluids and gases<br>
flow in a first end 23 and out a second 25. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 5C, the fluids<br>
and gases flow in a serpentine fashion through the pipes or pipe banks 22 alternating entering<br>
and exiting between first and second ends 23 and 25.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the loading process 100 of the present invention is depicted. The<br>
field production stream is collected through a pipeline via a loading buoy 110 about which the<br>
ship is tethered. This buoy 110 is connected to the moored ship by hawsers to which are<br>
attached flexible pipelines. The gas stream flows to a deck mounted inlet separator 112,<br>
whereby produced water and heavy hydrocarbons are separated and sent to different locations.<br>
The bulk gas flows to a compressor system 114, if needed. Produced water flows from the<br>
separator 112 to a produced water treating unit 116, which cleans the water to the required<br>
environmental standards. The condensate flows from the separator 112 to the compressed gas<br>
stream. It is possible to store the condensate separately in storage tanks 118 or is re-injected<br>
into the compressed gas system.<br>
The compressor system 114 (if required) raises the pressure of the gas to storage<br>
condition requirements, which are preferably about 1400 psig and -40°F. The compressed gas<br>
is cooled in cooler 120 and scrubbed in scrubber 122, and then sent to a mixing chamber 124.<br>
Condensate fallout from the scrubber 122 is directed to the condensate storage 118.<br>
In the mixing chamber 124 the gas stream is combined with metered volumes of a<br>
natural gas based liquid (NGL) solvent in accordance with the parameters set forth in the '757<br>
application, resulting in a gas-liquid solvent mixture referred to herein as a Compressed Gas<br>
5<br><br>
In accordance with preferred storage parameters, the CGL™<br>
gas mixture is stored at pressures in a range between about 1100 psig to about 2150 psig, and at<br>
temperatures preferably in a range between about-20°F to about -180°F, and more preferably<br>
in a range between about -40°F to about -80°F. In forming the CGL™ gas mixture, produced<br>
or natural gas is combined with the liquid solvent, preferably liquid ethane, propane or butane,<br>
or combinations thereof, at the following concentrations by weight: ethane preferably at<br>
approximately 25% mol and preferably in the range between about 15 % mol to about 30%<br>
mol; propane preferably at approximately 20% mol and preferably in a range between about<br>
15% mol to about 25% mol; or butane preferably at approximately 15% mol and preferably in<br>
a range between about 10% mol to about 30% mol; or a combination of ethane, propane and/or<br>
butane, or propane and butane in a range between about 10% mol to about 30% mol.<br>
Prior to chilling, the CGL™ gas mixture is preferably dehydrated with a methanol-<br>
water or solid desiccant (e.g., molecular sieve) to prevent hydrates from forming in the<br>
pipeline system 130. The NGL solvent additive provides the environment for greater effective<br>
density of the gas in storage and the desiccant process provides for storage product dehydration<br>
control.<br>
The now dry gas/solventfmethanol mix is then passed through a chiller 142 that is part<br>
of a refrigeration system 140, which comprises a compressor 144, a cooler 146, an accumulator<br>
148 and a Joule Thompson valve 149, and emerges as a one or two phase liquid stream. This<br>
stream then flows through a separator 128 to remove the aqueous phase from the hydrocarbon<br>
phase. The aqueous phase is returned to the methanol regeneration and storage system 126.<br>
The hydrocarbon phase flows to the main header 130 and on to sub-headers which feed the<br>
manifolds located atop vertical bundles of storage pipes 132. To store the CGL™ gas mixture,<br>
it is preferably introduced into a pressurized storage pipe or vessel bundle(s) 132 that<br>
preferably contain a methanol - water mixture to prevent vaporization of the CGL™ gas<br>
mixture.<br>
Introduction of the CGL™ gas mixture into a pipe or vessel bundle section 132 is done<br>
preferably by means of a vertical stinger, vertical inlet or outlet line running from the sub-<br>
header connection to the manifold atop the cap 133 of the pipe 132 to the base 135 of the pipe<br>
132. The pipe 132 fills, displacing a pressure controlled methanol - water mixture within the<br>
pipe 132, until a level control device mounted in the manifold detects the CGL™ gas mixture<br>
and causes inlet valve closure. When the inlet valve closes, the flow of the CGL™ gas mixture<br>
is diverted to fill the next bundle of pipes or vessels into which the methanol - water has been<br>
shuttled.<br>
6<br><br>
the CGL™ gas mixture tends to gain some heat and<br>
its temperature rises slightly as a result. When the higher temperatures are sensed by<br>
temperature sensing devices on the top manifolds, the pipeline bundles routinely have their<br>
contents circulated via a recirculation pump 138 from the top mounted outlets through a small<br>
recirculation refrigeration unit 136, which maintains the low temperature of the CGL™ gas<br>
mixture. Once the temperature of the CGL™ gas mixture reaches a preferred pipeline<br>
temperature, the cooled CGL™ gas mixture is circulated to other pipeline bundles and<br>
displaces the wanner CGL™ gas mixture within those bundles.<br>
An offloading process, where the CGL™ gas mixture is displaced from the pipes or<br>
vessel bundles and the produced or natural gas is segregated and offloaded to a market<br>
pipeline, is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. The stored CGL™ gas mixture is displaced from the<br>
pipeline system 220 using a methanol-water mixture stored in a storage system 210. This<br>
methanol-water mixture is pumped via circulating pumps 240 through part of the process to<br>
obtain pipeline temperatures. As shown in Step 1 in Figure 2, the cold methanol-water mixture<br>
displaces the CGL™ gas mixture from one or a group of pipe bundles 222, for example Bank<br>
1, to the unloading facilities shown in Figure 3. As shown in Step 2, as the methanol-water<br>
mixture looses pressure through the system 220, it returns to the circulating pumps 240 to<br>
increase its pressure. The higher pressure methanol-water mixture is then shuttled for use in the<br>
next group of pipe bundles 222, for example Bank 2. CGL™ displacement is achieved by<br>
reduction of pressure of the displaced fluid passing through a pressure reduction valve 310<br>
(Figure 3).<br>
As shown in Step 2, the methanol-water mixture in turn is reduced in pressure and is<br>
displaced from the pipeline system 220 using an inert (blanket) gas such as nitrogen. As<br>
shown in Step 3, the methanol-water mixture is purged from the pipe bundles 222 and the<br>
blanket gas remains in the pipe bundles 222 for the return voyage.<br>
Turning to Figure 3, in accordance with the offloading process 300, which includes<br>
separation and fractionation processes, the displaced CGL™ gas mixture flows from the<br>
pipeline system 230 to a pressure control station 310, preferably a Joule Thompson Valve,<br>
where it is reduced in pressure. A two phase mixture of light hydrocarbons flows to the de-<br>
ethanizer 312 whereupon an overhead stream consisting predominately of methane and ethane<br>
is separated from the heavier components, namely, propane, butanes and other heavier<br>
components..<br>
The heavier liquid stream exiting the bottom of the de-ethanizer 312 flows to a de-<br>
propanizer 314. The de-propanizer 314 separates the propane fraction from the butane and<br>
7<br><br>
bpane fraction flows overhead and is condensed in a<br>
cooler 316 and fed into a reflux drum 318. Part of the condensed stream is fed back from the<br>
reflux drum 318 to the de-propanizer 314 column as reflux and the balance of the propane<br>
stream flows to the pipeline system as solvent and is stored in the solvent storage system 220<br>
for reuse with the next batch of natural or produced gas to be stored and transported. As shown<br>
in Step 3 of Figure 2, reserve shuttle batches of NGL solvent and methanol-water mix remain<br>
in separate groups of pipe bundles for use with the next load of natural or produced gas to be<br>
stored and transported.<br>
The methane-ethane flow of gas from the de-ethanizer 312 is passed through a series of<br>
heat exchangers (not shown) where the temperature of the gas stream is raised. The pressure of<br>
the methane/ethane flow of gas is then raised by passing the gas through a compressor 324 (if<br>
necessary) and the discharge temperature of the methane/ethane flow of gas is then reduced by<br>
flowing through a cooler 326.<br>
The butane rich stream leaving the bottom of the de-propanizer 314 passes through a<br>
cooler 332 where it is cooled to ambient conditions and then flows to a condensate storage<br>
tank(s) 334.<br>
A side stream of the butane rich stream passes through a reboiler 330 and then back into<br>
the butane rich stream. The butane condensate mixture is then pumped via a pump 336 to the<br>
mixing valve 322 and is joined with a side stream of solvent for BTU adjustment and finally<br>
mixes with the methane - ethane stream. The gross heat content of the gas mix can preferably<br>
be adjusted to a range between 950 and 1260 BTU per 1000 cubic feet of gas.<br>
The offloaded gas is ready to meet delivery conditions for offloading to a receiving<br>
flexible pipeline which may be connected to a buoy 328. The buoy 328 is in turn connected to<br>
a mainland delivery pipeline and storage facilities.<br>
