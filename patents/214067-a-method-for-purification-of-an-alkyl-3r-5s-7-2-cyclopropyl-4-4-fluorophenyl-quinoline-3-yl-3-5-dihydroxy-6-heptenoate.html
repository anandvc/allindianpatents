5	remove such epimers, but, as is different from the<br>
	racemic modification, the optically active substance of<br>
	the formula (1) is a compound which is extremely<br>
	difficult to purify by recrystallization A purification<br>
	method by leading it to a p-toluene sulfonate or the<br>
10	like, has also been tried, but the purpose has not been<br>
	accomplised in any case for such a reason that lactone<br>
	modification tends to proceed during the purification<br>
	operation<br>
		However,by each of the asymmetric systhesis and the <br>
15	chiral synthon method, the optically active compound of<br>
	the formula (5) or (7) can be produced with a high<br>
	optical purity, whereby the antipode will not be wasted<br>
	Accordingly, if it can be establishaed as an industrial<br>
	production method, the economical effects will be<br>
20	substantial Therefore, it has been disered to establish<br>

	carry out the method of the object to be separated<br>
	BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
		In the present invention, the object to be separated<br>
20	and puirified is an alkyl (3R, 5S) -7- [3-cyclopropyl-4- (4-<br>
	fluorophenyl) quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydrozy-6-heptenoate of<br>
	the formula (1) wherein P is a C1-4 alkyl group)<br>
	containing one or both of an alkyl 
	cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorphenyl)quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-<br>
	as defined above) and an alkyl (3P, 5R)-7- [2-c clopropyl-<br>
	4-(4-flurophenyl)quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dishydrozy<br><br>
9<br>
	heptenoate of the formula (3) (wherein R is as defined<br>
	above).<br>
		The alkyl group R may, for example, be a methyl<br>
	group, an ethyl group, an isoprophyl<br>
5	group, a butyl group a sec-butyl group, an isobutyl<br>
	group or a tert-butyl group Among them, the alkyl group<br>
	is preferably one having 1 or 2 carbon atoms,<br>
	particularly preferably an ethyl 1 group.<br>
		The proportions of the compounds of the formulae<br>
10	(1),(2)and (3) to be contained, are not particulary<br>
	limited However, the higher the proportion of the<br>
	compound of the formula (1), the higher the separation<br>
	efficiency, whereby one having a high purity can be<br>
	obtained.<br>
15	The compounds of the formulae (2) and (3) are in the<br>
	relation of enantiomers to each other, and their<br>
	chromatographic behaviors are the same, and the ratio of<br>
	the two compounds may be 11 or different.<br>
		Further, there is no particular limitation to the<br>
20	optical purity of the compound of the formula (1), but<br>
	from the viewpoint of the prodution of an intermediate<br>
	for Pharmaceuticals as the object of the present<br>
	invention, an optical purity of at least 95%e is<br>
	preferred.<br>
25		In the chromatography treatment of the present<br>
	invention, the object can be accomplished by using either<br>
one of a common batch system using a single column {see<br><br>
10<br>
	Example 2) and a simulated moving bed method wherein<br>
	continuous separation is possible (see Examples 3 to 6)<br>
	However as the process for carrying out the method of<br>
	the present invention, it is more preferred to employ a<br>
5	simulated moving bed method The simulated moving bed<br>
	method is industrially used, for example, in the<br>
	separation of pute p-xylene from a mixture of xylenes<br>
	(Jp-B-42-15681, etc ] , and its concept will be briefly<br>
	explained<br>
10		The concept of the simulated moving bed (SMB) may<br>
	readily be understood by examining a true moving bed<br>
	method (TMB)as shown in Fig 1 The true moving bed<br>
	method (TMB) is designed for counter-current adsorption<br>
	separation treatment and is constituted by 4—zones,<br>
	directions There are two inlet paths, whereby the<br>
	solution (the feed) to be separated and the eluent are<br>
	continuously introduced From two outlet flow path(for<br>
	the extract and the raffinate) , pure products are<br>
20	continuously recovered The liquid coming out from zone<br>
	IV is returned (recycled) to zone I, and the solid coming<br>
	out from zone I is returned (recycled) to zone TV For<br>
	example, in the case of a two component mixture (A + B)<br>
	wherein component A has a shorter retention time, the<br>
25	operation conditions (the flow rates in the respective<br>
	zones are set so that component A moves upward, and<br>
	component, B moves downward Component A and component B<br><br>
11<br>
	can be recovered as pure products, respectively, from the<br>
	raffinate outlet and the extract outlet However, in<br>
	such a true moving bed method (TMB) , the operation, is<br>
	practically very difficult,since it is necessary to<br>
5	circulate the solid adsorbent<br>
		Now, on the basis of the true moving bed (TMB), the<br>
	simulated moving bed (SMB) is considered In the<br>
	simulated moving bed (SMB) , several fixed columns are<br>
	connected in series, and introducing points and<br>
10 	recovering points are properly moved (Fig 2)to let<br>
	counter-current actually take place Accordingly, each<br>
	flow path for the feed, the eluent, the extract or the<br>
	raffinate is moved for every column (or every few<br>
	columns) at constant time intervals in the flow direction<br>
15	of the solution. A specific method will be described in<br>
	Examples given hereinafter<br>
	In the chromatography treatment of the present invention,<br>
	as the packing material, silica gel may be advantageously<br>
	used by virtue of its separation characteristics Silica<br>
20	gel is inexpensive, and one having a constant quality can<br>
	readily be available, such being particularly<br>
	advantageous.In the present invention, if a packing<br>
	material other then silica gel, such as alumina, is used<br>
	the compound of the formula (1) is likely to undergo<br>
25	lactonization, such being undersirable. Further, if a<br>
	silicate, diatomaceous earth or the like is used,<br>
	inclusion of impurities such as metals or organic<br><br><br>
12<br>
	substances, is likely, such being undesirable,<br>
	particularly when the compound of the present invention<br>
	will be used as a material for Pharmaceuticals. As<br>
	silica gel, pulverized one may be used, but spherical one<br>
5	is preferred.The silica gel preferably has an average<br>
	particle size of from 0.1μm,to10mm, particularly<br>
	preferably from 1μm to μm, more preferably from 5 μm<br>
	to 100 μm. The average pore diameter of the silica gel<br>
	is preferably from 1 nm to 100μm,particularly<br>
10	preferably from 5 nm to 5 μm Here, the average particle<br>
	diameter, median diameter or mode diameter, is obtained<br>
	by a light scattering/laser diffraction method, and the<br>
	average micropore diameter is obtaied by a gas<br>
	adsorption method or mercury porosimeter.<br>
15	As the eluent for chromatography, a mixed solvent of<br>
	hydrocarbon/alcohol may, for example, be used<br>
	Particularly preferred is a mixture of hexane/isopropyl<br>
	alcohol. However,the eluent is not particularly limited<br>
	so long as it presents no adverse effect to the stability<br>
20	of the packing material. In a case where a mixed solvent<br>
	of hexane/isopropyl alcohol is to be employed, the ratio<br>
	of hexane/isopropyl alcohol is usually within a range of<br>
	from 99 1 to 50/50, preferably from 98/2 to 70/30, more<br>
	preferably from 96/4 to 85/15, in a volume ratio. A<br>
25	third solvent may be incorporated, but in the case of<br>
	chromatography treatment, particularly in the case of the<br>
	simulated moving bed method, the composition is<br><br>
13<br>
	preferably as simple as possible for the recovery and<br>
	reuse of the solvents.<br>
		From the recovered eluent (the raffinate and the<br>
	extract in the simulated moving bed method) , the solvents<br>
5	can be distilled and reused. The composition of the<br>
	solvents may be analyzed, for example, by gas<br>
	chromatography, and either component of the eluent is<br>
	added thereto to adjust the composition to the<br>
	predetermined composition of the eluent, whereupon the<br>
10	adjusted mixed solvent can readily be reused for column<br>
	separation (see Example 6)For the above distillation<br>
	of the solvents, an evaporator or condenser may be<br>
	employed Usually, a thin membrane type condenser can<br>
	suitably be used,<br>
15	In the chromatography treatment of the present<br>
	invention, the column temperature is preferably set to be<br>
	a constant temperature (for example, at 40ºC as in<br>
	Example 1) within a range of from 10 to 50ºC, preferably<br>
	within a range of from 20 to 45ºC. Other conditions for<br>
20	carrying out the chromatography treatment such as the<br>
	supply rates of the eluent and the solution containing a<br>
	mixture of isomers, the flow rates at the discharge<br>
	outlets of the raffinate and the extract, the time for<br>
	switching the column, the pressure,etc,are<br>
25	properly set in accordance with the chromatography<br>
	techniques know to those skilled in the art so that<br>
	they are suitable for the conditons for e g the packing<br><br>
14<br>
	material, the eluent, the production quantity, etc<br>
	EXAMPLES<br>
	Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
	detail with reference to Examples, but it should be<br>
5	understood that the present invention is by no means<br>
	restricted to such specific Examples<br>
	In the following Examples, a compound of the formula<br>
	(1), wherein R -IS an ethyl group is used, and this<br>
	compound will be referred to as (3R,5S)DOLE(1), the<br>
10	compound of the formula (2) will be referred to as<br>
