The present invention relates to a photo-bleaching composition. The present invention also relates to a method of treating fabric using the photo-bleaching composition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
EP 0035470 discloses a textile treatment composition, which  comprises  a  photo-bleaching  component.  The  photo-bleach material has some effect against stains, but can also attack dye.<br>
EP 1196521 discloses a fabric care system comprising a radical photo-initiator selected from hydrogen abstraction photo-initiators, bond cleavage radical photo-initiators or mixtures thereof is used to treat fabric, for example as a stain removal system in the washing or rinsing of fabric in a laundry process.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A method of photo-bleaching a textile comprising the steps of treating a textile with a photo-bleaching composition, the photo-bleaching composition comprising vitamin K3 together with at least 1 wt% an ingredient selected from the group consisting of: fabric conditioning agent; and, surfactant, in an aqueous wash medium followed by irradiating the treated textile.<br>
The present invention provides a bleaching composition, comprising an aromatic 1, 4 quinone together with at least 1<br><br>
WO 2004/072217	PCT/EP2004/000960<br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
wt% an ingredient selected from the group consisting of: fabric conditioning agent, and surfactant.<br>
The remaining bulk of the bleaching composition comprises carriers and adjunct ingredients to 100 wt/wt % of the total bleaching composition.  This bulk, in part or whole, may be selected from solvents, conditioners, builders, other bleach components, softening agents and other components as described herein.<br>
It has also been found that	the photo-bleach of the present<br>
invention has the advantage	that they are stable in solution<br>
if kept in the dark.  It is	found that they do not degrade<br>
spontaneously on storage.<br>
The photo-bleach systems according to the present invention are found to be soluble or dispersible in other media than water and can be used on dry-clean only garments.<br><br>
20  The present invention extends to a commercial package<br>
comprising the aromatic quinone (photobleach) of the present invention together with instructions for its use in the treatment of a textile.<br>
-25 - Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The following are exemplified non-limiting structures of suitable aromatic quinones that may used in the present invention:<br><br>
WO  2004/072217<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/000960<br><br><br><br>
The aromatic quinone is part of a six membered conjugated ring.  The aromatic quinone comprises two oxygen atoms that are 1,4 (e.g. as found in 1,4-naphthoquinone). In contrast to benzoquinone per se, it is preferred that the aromatic 10  quinone moiety is further part of an extended conjugated pi system, such as found in naphthoquinones, and anthraquinones etc. It is preferred that the aromatic quinone comprises the core structure of napthoquinone, this encompasses anthraguinone.<br><br>
WO  2004/072217<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/000960<br><br><br>
The extended conjugated pi system may contain one or more heteroatoms as illustrated below.<br>
O<br><br>
5 The aromatic quinones may be optionally substituted provided that the substituent does not result in rapid intramolecular quenching of the excited state of the aromatic quinone. The rate of intramolecular quenching is dependent on two factors the type of substituent and the position of the substituent<br>
10  with respect to the carbonyl groups of the quinone.  With<br>
reference to the structures illustrated below, structure (a) is not suitable because of the propensity for intramolecular quenching; it is seen that the amine is three atoms remote from a carbonyl of the quinone.  The quinone of structure<br>
15  (b) is suitable for use with the present invention because the carbonyl is four atoms remote from a carbonyl of the quinone.<br><br>
20<br>
As one skilled in the art will appreciate not only an amine substituent would serve to quench the excited state of the<br><br>
WO  2004/072217	PCT/EP2004/000960<br>
quinone; examples of other such substituents to be avoided which are three atoms remote from a carbonyl of the quinone are: -OH, NR2, -NHR, wherein R is alkyl or aromatic. With regard to this intermolecular quenching, it is most 5  preferred that the aromatic quinone used in the present invention has a half-life (t1/2) of greater than 100 ns in oxygen free benzene after irradiation.  The half-life(t1/2) is the intrinsic quality of the aromatic quinone per se. Reference to half-life (t1/2) as described herein is as 10  described above unless explicitly defined otherwise.<br>
The following are suitable aromatic quinones that may used in the present invention: 1,4-naphthoquinone, 9,10-anthraquinone , 2-methyl-l,4-napthoquinone (vitamin K3) which<br>
15  is widely used in chicken feed [the holistic approach to chicken nutrition and stain removal].  The preferred aromatic quinones are those based upon vitamin K3 or metabolites thereof. Vitamin K3 is particularly preferred because we have surprisingly found that vitamin X3 is<br>
20  classified as not photo-toxic according to the protocol as found in Annex II "B.41. Photo-toxicity-In Vitro 3T3 NRU Photo-toxicity Test" of the Commission Directive 2000/33/EC of 25 April 2000 as published in Official Journal of the European Communities EN. L 136/98 8.6.2000. 25<br>
The photo-bleach suitably undergoes one of the reactions set out above when excited by radiation falling generally in the range 290-800 nm.  For example, natural sunlight, which comprises light in this region, will be suitable for causing<br>
30  the photo-bleach to undergo one of the reactions described above.  Preferably, the photo-bleach has a maximum<br><br>
WO  2004/072217	PCT/EP2004/000960<br><br>
extinction-coefficient in the ultraviolet range (290-400 nm) which is greater than 100 mol-1 1cm-1  Suitably, the photo-bleach is a solid or a liquid at room temperature.<br>
5  Preferably, the photo-bleach is substantially colourless and gives non-coloured photoproducts upon irradiation.<br>
The present inventors have found that photo-bleaches having a specified hydrophobicity, measured by their log P value, 10  have a particularly preferred effect.  All materials for the removal of stains also have a tendency to attack dye.  The preferred photo-bleach systems have a particularly beneficial balance of stain removal versus dye attack tendency.<br><br>
15<br>
20<br><br>
Preferably, the photo-bleach has a high log P value, where log P is the octanol-water partition coefficient.  It is preferred that the photo-bleach has a log P measured at 25°C in excess of 2.5 and more preferably in excess of 4.0.<br>
The Log P value may be changed by varying pendant groups of the aromatic quinone.<br>
Fabric Care/Fabric Wash Bleaching Compositions<br><br>
25.<br>
The present invention is suitable for use in industrial or domestic fabric wash compositions, fabric conditioning compositions and compositions for both washing and conditioning fabrics (so-called through the wash conditioner 3 0  compositions).  The present invention can also be applied to<br><br>
WO  2004/072217	PCT/EP2004/000960<br><br>
industrial or domestic non-detergent based fabric care compositions, for example spray-on compositions.<br>

Detergent compositions suitable for use in domestic or industrial automatic fabric washing machines generally contain anionic non-soap surfactant or nonionic surfactant, or combinations of the two in suitable ratio, as will be 5  known to the person skilled in the art, optionally together with soap.<br>
Many suitable detergent-active compounds are available and fully described in the literature, for example in "Surface-10  Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch.<br>
Anionic surfactant is suitably present at a level of from 5 wt% to 50 wt%, preferably 10 wt%-40 wt% based on the fabric 15  treatment composition.  Nonionic surfactant is suitably.<br>
present at a level of 1 to 2 0 wt%, preferably 5 to 15 wt%.<br>
The total amount of surfactant present in the bleaching composition will depend upon the intended end use and may be<br>
20  as high as 60 wt% for example in a composition for washing fabrics by hand.  In this regard it is preferred that the bleaching composition comprises between 2 to 60 is wt% of a surfactant, preferably 5 to 40 wt%. The surfactant has an HLB (hydrophilic/lipophilic balance) greater that 10, more<br>
25      preferably greater than 15,... For a discussion of HLB the reader is directed to and article by Griffin, W. C. in J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemists Vol. 1 page 311, 1945 and Davies, J. T. and Rideal, E. K. in Interfacial Phenomena, Acad. Press, NY, 1961, pages 371 to 382.  The HLB value requirement<br>
3 0  reflects the importance of the rate of solubility and<br>
dispersibility of the surfactant present from the bleaching<br><br>

Hair and Skin Bleaching<br>
15<br>
A bleaching composition comprising vitamin K3 is suitable for bleaching hair and skin and in this regard the present invention extents to such.  The hair/skin bleaching composition comprises suitable adjutants and carriers as 20  found in respective chapters of Harry's Cosmeticology, 8th<br>
edition, Edited by Dr Martin Rieger; ISBN: 0-82060372-4. The present invention extends to a method of treating hair and skin respectively with a vitamin K3 containing composition.<br>
25 other. Applications<br>
There is consumer concern with regard to chemical contact between consumer and the majority of chemical compounds. Irrespective of whether the concern is judged to be 30  warranted or not, the perception by the consumer is of paramount concern to producers of products.  It would be<br><br>
WO 2004/072217	PCT/EP2004/000960<br><br>
desirable to be able to-allay consumer concern by providing products having more "consumer friendly" acceptable photo-initiators. In,this regard, vitamin K3 may be used also as a photo-initiator for polymerisation of monomers for the 5  production articles, in particular food packaging.<br>
The photo-polymerisation may be carried out with a chain carrier, for example an amine synergist, to improve the polymerisation process. Particularly preferred are acrylated 10  amine oligomers as they will be polymerised into the polymer matrix and hence cannot escape.<br>
The present invention will be further described by way of example only with reference to the following examples. 15<br>
Example 1<br>
The following three photo-bleaches were selected for comparison 2 , 4, 6-trimethyl benzophenone, Esacure KIP-150, and 2-ethyl-anthraguinone. Esacure KIP-150 is alpha-hydroxy-<br>
2	0  ketone based bond cleavage initiator and is available from<br>
Lamberti Spa (Via Marsala, 38 21013 Gallarate VA Italy). The benzophenone is an example of a non-catalytic hydrogen abstractor photo-bleach in contrast to the aromatic quinones of the present invention.<br>
  25<br>
Palm oil stained cloths (Brazilian) were prepared as follows. Palm oil 0.06g was added deposited onto individual woven white cotton cloth samples weighing 1.2g each. The cloth samples were allowed to age for 1 hour before being<br>
3	0  washed. Each wash consisted of four stained cloths, 200ml of<br>
40 °C water and 1g of Persil Colour washing powder (purchased<br><br>

in UK, zeolite based). The wash liquor was agitated for 20 minutes then the clothes rinsed in cold water, wrung and irradiated in a weatherometer for 18 minutes. The weatherometer is designed to simulate outside line drying and was set to give 42 W/m2 in the UVA&amp;B.<br>
The washes were duplicated but with the addition of 9 ppm of the photo-bleach to the wash solution, corresponding to 0.18% by weight on the powder formulation.<br>
After the wash/irradiation procedure the staining of the clothes relative to clean white cloth was measured on a reflectometer and expressed as the deltaE value.<br><br>

In the absence of photo-bleach a strong coloured stain is observed on the cloth, as indicated by the high deltaE value. The three photo-bleach result in bleaching of the stain and reduce the deltaE value. The results show that 2-<br><br>

ethylanthraquinone provides a greater bleaching effect over the other photo-bleaches.  It is evident from the results that the stain is essentially removed in the experiment where 2-ethylanthraquinone is employed as a photo-bleach.<br>
Example 2<br>
The following three photo-bleaches were selected for comparison Esacure KIP-150, Camphoroquinone (non-aromatic quinone), and 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone.<br>
The same procedure as found Example 1 was used and the results presented in Table 2.<br><br><br>

The aromatic quinone provides greater photo-bleaching than the other photo bleaches.<br>
20  Example 3<br>
A 1.5 g sample of PEG-methacrylate was poured into a glass tube and sealed. A similar sample was prepared but with the addition of 0.15% of vitamin K3. The samples were place outside on a sunny morning in February 2 0 03 facing the sun 25  at an angle of 10 degrees to the earth in Port Sunlight,<br>
Wirral, UK. After 3 0 minutes the sample containing vitamin<br><br>

5  Photo-Toxicity Test<br>
Photo-bleaches were tested for photo-toxicity using the Photo-toxicity-In Vitro 3T3 NRU Photo-toxicity Test" of the Commission Directive 2000/33/EC of 25 April 2000 as 10  published in Official Journal of the European Communities EN. L 136/98 8.6.2000.<br>
A positive result in the in vitro 3T3 NRU photo-toxicity test (PIF &gt; 5 or MPE &gt; 0,1) indicates that the test 15  substance has photo-toxic potential.<br>
