Description:<br>
Waxing device for a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins<br>
The invention relates to a waxing device according to the preamble of claim 1.*<br>
Waxing devices for textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins have been known for a long time and a large number have been described in the patent literature. Waxing devices of this type are primarily used to reduce the coefficient of friction of a yarn. In other words, during rewinding of small-volume spinning cops to form large volume cross-wound bobbins, as takes place, for example on automatic cross winding machines, paraffin wax particles are applied to the yarn, which improve the running and sliding properties of the yarn, and this is of considerable significance, in particular in the subsequent processing operations, for example during knitting.<br>
In order to achieve the most uniform wear possible of the paraffin wax body, in known waxing devices, the paraffin wax body is rotated slowly about its longitudinal centre line, the running thread at the same time lightly contacting the end face of the paraffin wax body. In these known waxing devices, the paraffin wax body is mounted so as to be rotationally engaged but axially displaceable on a driveable bearing shaft, and is generally loaded by a spring element in the direction of the running thread.<br>
The working position of the paraffin wax body, by which the quantity of paraffin wax application can be ascertained can be predetermined here by adjustable path limitation means.<br>
However, it has been found to be disadvantageous in these known waxing devices that these waxing devices are relatively strongly inclined to soiling. In other words, the paraffin wax particles removed by the running thread from the paraffin wax<br><br>
body and often not adhering adequately firmly to the thread lead, after a relatively short time, to soiling of the waxing devices and also, owing the gravitational force, in particular to heavy soiling of the components arranged below the waxing devices.<br>
It has therefore already been proposed to arrange the rotatable paraffin wax body inside a stationary cover or to at least to install a collecting tray underneath the paraffin wax body, in which tray the abraded paraffin wax particles which have not been entrained by the running thread can be collected.<br>
A waxing device with a collecting tray of this type below the rotatable paraffin wax body is described, for example in DE 43 38 453 Al. This known waxing device also has, on its front side, a two-part cover, by means of which abraded particles are also to be prevented from being able to drop down. In practice, the use of collection containers for paraffin wax particles which fall down has not proven to be very practical as the paraffin wax particles collected in time lead to substantial soiling of the entire waxing device resulting in impairment of the functioning capacity of the waxing device. In addition, such collecting containers also hinder the accessibility of the machine parts located below the collecting containers.<br>
A comparable device is also described in DE 103 42 009 Al. In this known waxing device, the paraffin wax body rotates inside a stationary tubular cover. The cover, which is closed at the front by a pivotably mounted cover element, has upper and lower through-openings for the running thread. A receptacle for dropping paraffin wax particles, which do not adhere to the running thread, is integrated into the cover element.<br>
In this known waxing device, it can also not be prevented that, with time, so many paraffin wax particles collect in the receptacle of the cover element that there is a serious disruption of the functioning capacity of the waxing device. In addition, in this known waxing device, there is always the danger of the rotating paraffin wax body running onto the stationary casing, which leads to an increased abrasion of the<br><br>
paraffin wax body and, correspondingly with time, to a substantial soiling of the waxing device. These collected, often agglutinating paraffin wax particles are also often entrained in an uncontrolled manner by the running thread and then lead to a substantial soiling of the thread traversing device connected downstream in the thread running path.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of providing a waxing device, in which it is ensured that undesired paraffin wax abrasion is very substantially avoided and it is also ensured that no accumulation of abraded paraffin particles can be produced in the region of the waxing device, which particles could then be entrained in an uncontrolled manner by the running thread.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a waxing device, as is described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The axially displaceable, but rotationally engaged arrangement according to the invention of a paraffin wax body inside a rotatable wax cup, in particular, has the advantage that no direct relative movement takes place between the comparatively sensitive paraffin wax body and a stationary housing surrounding the paraffin wax body, which could lead to undesired particle abrasion at the paraffin wax body. In other words, according to the invention, the paraffin wax body is located in a special rotatable wax cup, protected against undesired abrasion and also against dust and fibre fly. As the wax cup can be easily exchanged at any time if necessary, together with the paraffin wax body, putting in a new paraffin wax body in the configuration according to the invention is also completely unproblematical.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment it is provided in this case that the paraffin wax body is axially displaceably arranged on a bearing lug of the wax cup and is connected in a rotationally engaged manner to the wax cup via an entraining disc<br><br>
(claim 2). In a configuration of this type it is ensured that only a relatively slight axial relative movement takes place between the paraffin wax body and the surrounding wax cup. This very slow axial displacement of the paraffin wax body inside the wax cup is produced by the paraffin wax particle abrasion of the running thread during the rewinding process.<br>
As described in claim 3, it is provided in a preferred embodiment that an annular gap is provided between the outer periphery of the wax cup and the inner wall of the stationary housing. An annular gap of this type ensures not only perfect, smooth running rotation of the wax cup inside the stationary housing of the waxing device, but also allows cyclic clearing, for example, of the waxing device by the blast device described in claim 4. This blast device consists, as shown in claim 4, substantially of a blast nozzle arrangement arranged in the base region of the stationary housing, and which is connected to an excess pressure source via an electromagnetic valve which can be activated in a defined manner. A large number of annularly arranged blast nozzles are directed in this case onto the annular gap in such a way that possible contaminations can be blasted out without problems and rapidly. In other words, the blast nozzle arrangement in the region of the annular gap ensures that no dirt or dust particles are deposited in the annular gap and are able to impair the function of the waxing device over time.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, as described in claim 5, path limitation means are provided inside the wax cup to limit the axial displacement of the paraffin wax body. These path limitation means are fastened to a pivoting flap arranged at the front of the stationary housing of the waxing device, which flap is closed during the winding operation, in other words is positioned in an operating position.<br>
To put in a new paraffin wax body, the pivoting flap can easily be pivoted from the operating position in to a loading position, in which a new paraffin wax body or a wax cup with a new paraffin wax body can be put in. In other words, in the operating position, the pivoting flap with the path limitation means is arranged in<br><br>
such a way that the paraffin wax body can be positioned in various, predeterminable working positions, while the waxing device is freely accessible in the loading position of the pivoting flap.<br>
According to claim 6, in an advantageous embodiment, it is also provided that the pivoting flap can be locked in the operating position by means of a permanent magnet arrangement. The pivoting flap is preferably manufactured for this purpose from a ferromagnetic material, from example steel, while permanent magnet elements are let into the housing which surrounds the paraffin wax body and consists, for example, of a plastics material.<br>
A permanent magnet arrangement of this type is not only economical, but also very functionally reliable. In addition, a permanent magnet arrangement of this type works virtually without maintenance.<br>
As shown in claims 7 and 8, the rotation of the wax cup takes place in an advantageous embodiment by means of an electric motor single drive. In other words, the bearing shaft on which the wax cup is arranged in a rotationally engaged manner is connected to the motor shaft of a single drive which can be activated in a defined manner.<br>
In this manner, the wax cup, in particular with regard to its rotational speed, can be adjusted individually.<br>
The single drive is, in this case, preferably configured as a stepping motor, as described in claim 8. A stepping motor of this type is an economical and virtually maintenance-free drive means.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter in more detail with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br><br>
Fig. 1	schematically shows a side view of a work station of a textile machine<br>
producing cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment of an automatic . cross  winding  machine,  comprising  a  waxing  device  configured according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2	shows the waxing device according to the invention to a larger scale, in<br>
a side view and in section,<br>
Fig.l shows a schematic side view of a work station 2 of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the present example of a so-called automatic cross winding machine 1. Such automatic cross winding machines 1 have a plurality of similar work stations 2 arranged in series next to one another, on which, as known and therefore not described in more detail, spinning cops 3, which have relatively little yarn volume, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 5.<br>
The running thread 16 is also monitored for possible yarn defects, as is known, during rewinding, which are optionally cleared out. Moreover, the thread 16 is waxed during the rewinding process. In other words, the thread 16 is guided via a waxing device 19, which ensures that the coefficient of friction of the thread 16 is reduced. In other words, the running and sliding properties of the thread 16 are significantly improved by an application of this type of paraffin wax.<br>
A corresponding waxing device 19 will be described in more detail hereinafter with the aid of Fig. 2.<br>
The cross-wound bobbins 5 are transferred, after they have been finished, by means of an automatically working service unit (not shown) onto a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 7 along the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br><br>
As also indicated in Fig.l, such automatic cross winding machines 1 are often equipped with a bobbin or tube transporting system 6, in which the spinning cops 3 or the empty tubes circulate on transporting plates 11. Only the cop supply section 24, the storage section 25, which can be driven in a reciprocating manner, one of the transverse transporting sections 26 leading to the work stations 2 and the tube return section 27 are shown in Fig.l of a bobbin and tube transporting system 6 of this type.<br>
The individual work stations 2 also have various devices which ensure proper operation of work stations of this type. Devices of this type are known per se and therefore only indicated in Fig.l.<br>
One of these known devices is, for example the winding device 4, which has a creel 8 that is moveably mounted about a pivot pin 12. According to the present embodiment, the cross-wound bobbin 5 rests, during the winding process, with its surface on a drive drum 9 and is entrained via frictional engagement by this drive drum 9 which is acted upon by a single motor.<br>
The corresponding drive connected via a control line 35 to a work station computer 28 has the reference numeral 33.<br>
To traverse the thread 16 during the winding process, a thread traversing device 10 is provided. A thread traversing device 10 of this type, that is also known and indicated only schematically in Fig.l, has, for example, a thread guide 13, with a finger-like thread transfer lever. The thread transfer lever that is acted upon by an electromechanical drive 14 traverses the thread 16 between the two end faces of the cross-wound bobbin 5. The drive 14 of the thread guide 13 is also connected to a work station computer 28 via a control line 15.<br>
As indicated above, the work stations 2 of such automatic cross winding machines 1 also have a waxing device 19 in the thread running path directly upstream from the<br><br>
thread traversing device 10, which makes it possible to provide the thread 16 with a paraffin wax application during the rewinding process.<br>
As indicated in the figures the single drive 34 of the waxing device 19 "is also connected via a control line 57 to the work station computer 28.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the waxing device 19 according to the invention in section. The waxing device 19 has a stationary housing 23, which is fixed via a holder (not shown) to the spinning station housing 60.<br>
A stepping motor 34, which is connected via a control line 57 to a work station computer 28, is fastened to this station housing 23. A wax cup 41 is mounted in a rotationally engaged manner on the motor shaft 58 of this stepping motor 34 via a bearing lug 36. A paraffin wax body 18 is mounted so as to be rotationally engaged, but axially displaceable on the bearing lug 36 inside the wax cup 41.<br>
A pivoting flap 21, which is pivotable between an operating position and a loading position and is locked in the operating position by a permanent magnet arrangement 22, is articulated at the front to the stationary housing 23. The permanent magnet arrangement 22 consists here of permanent magnet elements 29 let into the housing 23 and of the pivoting flap 21 manufactured from ferromagnetic material. The pivoting flap 21 has path limitation means 17, via the angle position of which various working positions of the paraffin wax body 18 that is mounted inside the wax cup 41, so as to be axially displaceable but rotationally engaged, can be adjusted.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the paraffin wax body 18 is connected, in this case, via an entraining disc 37, which has pins 38 or the like in a rotationally engaged manner to the bearing lug 36 of the wax cup 41 and therefore also connected in a rotationally engaged manner to the wax cup 41. The axial displacement of the paraffin wax body 18 on the bearing lug 36 takes place via a spring element 39. This spring element 39<br><br>
rests on a pressure plate 40 and loads the entraining disc 37 in the direction R. In other words the paraffin wax body 18 is displaced in the direction R inside the wax cup 41 until it rests with its front side 42 on the path limitation means 17.<br>
The stationary housing 23, in its base region 45, also has a blast nozzle arrangement 54, which is connected to an excess pressure source 55 via an electromagnetic value 56 which can be activated in a defined manner. In other words, a large number of annularly arranged blast nozzles are directed onto the annular gap 53 provided between the inner wall 51 of the housing 23 and the outer periphery of the wax cup 41 in such a way that possible contaminations in the region of the annular gap 53 can be blasted out without problems and quickly.<br><br>
