				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to compounds with antiviral activity and more specifically with HIV-integrase inhibitory properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and related diseases are a major public health problem worldwide. A virally encoded integrase protein mediates specific incorporation and integration of viral DNA into the host genome. Integration is necessary for viral replication. Accordingly, inhibition of HIV integrase is an impbrtant therapeutic pursuit for treatment of HTV infection of the related diseases.<br>
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HTV-1) encodes three enzymes which are required for viral replication: reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. Although drugs targeting reverse transcriptase and protease are in wide use and have shown effectiveness, particularly wheii employed in combination, toxicity and development of resistant strains have limited their usefulness (Palella, etal N. Engl. J.Med. (1998) 338:853-860; Richman, D. D. Nature (2001) 410:995-1001). There is a need for new agents directed against alternate sites in the viral life cycle. Integrase has emerged as an attractive target, because it is necessary for stable infection and homologous enzymes are lacking in the human host (LaFemina, etal /. Virol. (1992) 66:7414-7419). The function of integrase is to catalyze integration of proviral DNA, resulting from the reverse transcription of viral RNA, into the host genome, by a stepwise fashion of endonucleolytic processing of proviral DNA within a cytoplasmic preintegration complex (termed 3'-processing or "3'-P") with specific DNA sequences at the end of the HTV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) regions, followed by<br>
translocation of the complex into the nuclear compartment where integration of 3'-processed<br>
proviral DNA into host DNA occurs in a "strand transfer" (ST) reaction (Hazuda, etal<br>
Science (2000) 287:646-650; Katzman, etal Adv. Virus Res. (1999) 52:371-395; Asante-<br>
Applah, etal Adv. Virus Res. (1999) 52:351-369). Although numerous agents potently<br>
inhibit 3'-P and ST in extracellular assays that employ recombinant integrase and viral long-<br>
terminal-repeat oligonucleotide sequences, often such inhibitors lack inhibitory potency<br>
when assayed using fully assembled preintegration complexes or fail to show antiviral<br>
effects against HW-infected cells (Pornmier, etal Adv. Virus Res. (1999) 52:427-458;<br>
Farnet, etal Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U.SA. (1996) 93:9742-9747; Pornmier, etal Antiviral Res.<br>
(2000)47:139-148.	â€¢<br>
Certain HIV integrase inhibitors have been disclosed which block integration in extracellular assays and exhibit good antiviral effects against BOV-infected cells (Anthony, etal WO 02/30426; Anthony, etal WO 02/30930; Anthony, etal WO 02/30931; WO 02/055079; Zhuang, etal WO 02/36734; US 6395743; US 6245806; US 6271402; Fujishita, etal WO 00/039086; Uenaka etal WO 00/075122; Selnick, etal WO 99/62513; Young, etal WO 99/62520; Payne, etal WO 01/00578; Jing, etal Biochemistry (2002) 41:5397-5403; Pais, etal Jour. Med. Chem. (2002) 45:3184-94; Goldgur, etal Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U.S.A. (1999) 96:13040-13043; Espeseth, etal Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U.SA. (2000) 97:11244-11249).<br>
HTV integrase inhibitory compounds with improved antiviral and pharmacokuietic properties are desirable, including enhanced activity against development of HIV resistance, improved oral bioavailability, greater potency and extended effective half-life in vivo (Nair, V. "HIV integrase as a target for antiviral chemotherapy" Reviews in Medical Virology (2002) 12(3): 179-193). Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship studies and docking simulations (Buolamwini, etal/owr. Med. Chem. (2002) 45:841-852) of conformationally-restrained cinnamoyl-type integrase inhibitors (Artico, etal Jour. Med. Chem. (1998) 41:3948-3960) have correlated hydrogen-bonding interactions to the inhibitory activity differences among the compounds.<br>
Improving the deli very of drugs and other agents to target cells and tissues has been the focus of considerable research for many years. Though many attempts have been made to develop effective methods for importing biologically active molecules into cells, both in vivo and in vitro, none has proved to be entirely satisfactory. Optimizing the association of<br>
the inhibitory drag with its intracellular target, while minimizing intercellular redistribution of the drug, e.g. to neighboring cells, is often difficult or inefficient.<br>
Most agents currently administered parenterally to a patient are not targeted, resulting in systemic delivery of the agent to cells and tissues of the body where it is unnecessary, and often undesirable. This may result in adverse drug side effects, and often limits the dose of a drug (e.g., cytotoxic agents anJ other anti-cancer or anti-viral drugs) that can be administered. By comparison, although oral administration of drugs is generally recognized as a convenient and economical method of administration, oral administration can result hi either (a) uptake of the drug through the cellular and tissue barriers, e.g. blood/brain, epithelial, cell membrane, resulting in undesirable systemic distribution, or (b) temporary residence of the drug within the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, a major, goal has been to develop methods for specifically targeting agents to cells and tissues. Benefits of such treatment includes avoiding the general physiological effects of inappropriate delivery of such agents to other cells and tissues, such as uninfected cells. Intracellular targeting may be achieved by methods and compositions which allow accumulation or retention of biologically active agents inside cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying descriptions, structure and formulas. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the enumerated embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
Unless stated otherwise, the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings:<br>
The terms "phosphonate" and "phosphonate group" mean a functional group or moiety within a molecule that comprises at least one phosphorus-carbon bond, and at least one phosphorus-oxygen double bond. The phosphorus atom is further substituted with oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen substituents. These substituents may be part of a prodrug moiety. As defined herein, "phosphonate" and "phosphonate group" include molecules with phosphonic acid, phosphonic monoester, phosphonic diester, phosphonamidate, phosphondiamidate, and phosphonthioate functional groups.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used herein refers to any compound that when administered to a biological system generates the drug substance, i.e. active ingredient, as a result of<br>
!<br>
spontaneous chemical reaction(s), enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction(s), photolysis, and/or metabolic chemical reaction(s). A prodrug is thus a covalently modified analog or latent form of a therapeuticaHy-active compound.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" refers to a compound that is metabolized in the host, for example hydrolyzed or oxidized, by either enzymatic action or by general acid or base solvolysis, to form an active ingredient. Typical examples of prodrugs of the compounds of the invention have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety of the compound. Prodrugs include compounds mat can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, esterified, deesterified, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, photolyzed, hydrolyzed, or other functional group change or conversion involving forming or breaking chemical bonds on the prodrug.<br>
"Prodrug moiety" means a labile functional group which separates from the active inhibitory compound during metabolism, systemicaUy, inside a cell, by hydrolysis, enzymatic cleavage, or by some other process (Bundgaard, Hans, "Design and Application of Prodrugs" in Textbook of Drug Design and Development (1991), P. Krogsgaard-Larsen andH. Bundgaard, Eds. Harwood Academic Publishers, pp. 113-191). Enzymes which are capable of an enzymatic activation mechanism with the prodrug compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, amidases, esterases, microbial enzymes, phospholipases, cholinesterases, and phosphases. Prodrug moieties can serve to enhance solubility, absorption and lipophilicity to optimize drug delivery, bioavailability and efficacy. A "prodrug" is thus a covalently modified analog of a therapeutically-active compound.<br>
Exemplary prodrug moieties include the hydrolytically sensitive or labile acyloxymethyl esters -CH2OC(=O)R9 and acyloxymethyl carbonates -CH2OC(=O)OR9 where R9 is Ci-Ce alkyl, Ci-C6 substituted alkyl, C<rc20 aryl or c6-c2o substituted aryl. the acyloxyalkyl ester was first used as a prodrug strategy for carboxylic acids and then applied to phosphates phosphonates by farquhar etal j. plmrm. sci. also us patent nos. in certain compounds of invention moiety is part phosphonate group. subsequently deliver phosphonic across cell membranes enhance oral bioavailability. close variant alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl may bioavailability combinations invention. an exemplary acyloxymethyl pivaloyloxymethoxy carbonate pivaloyloxymethylcarbonate></rc20>
The phosphonate group may be a phosphonate prodrug moiety. The prodrug moiety may be sensitive to hydrolysis, such as, but not limited to a pivaloyloxymethyl carbonate (POC) or POM group. Alternatively, the prodrug moiety may be sensitive to enzymatic potentiated cleavage, such as a lactate ester or a phosphonamidate-ester group. Exemplary phosphonate prodrug moieties include by way of example and not limitation groups of the structure A3.<br>
Aryl esters of phosphorus groups, especially phenyl esters, are reported to enhance oral bioavailability (DeLambert etal (1994) /. Med. Chem. 37: 498). Phenyl esters containing a carboxylic ester ortho to the phosphate have also been described (Khamnei and Torrence, (1996) J. Med, Chem. 39:4109-4115). Benzyl esters are reported to generate the parent phosphonic acid. In some cases, substituents at the ortho-oi para-position may   -accelerate the hydrolysis. Benzyl analogs with an acylated phenol or an alkylated phenol may generate the phenolic compound through the action of enzymes, e.g. esterases, oxidases, etc., which in turn undergoes cleavage at the benzylic C-O bond to generate the phosphoric acid and the quinone methide intermediate. Examples of this class of prodrugs are described by Mitchell etal (1992) /. Chem. Soc. PerJdn Trans. 12345; Brook etal WO 91/19721. Still other benzylic prodrugs have been described containing a carboxylic ester-containing group attached to the benzylic methylene (Glazier etal WO 91/19721). Thio-containing prodrugs are reported to be useful for the intracellular delivery of phosphonate<br>
drugs. These proesters contain an ethylthio group in which the thiol group is either esterified with an acyl group or combined with another thiol group to form a disulfide. Deesterification or reduction of the disulfide generates the free thio intermediate which subsequently breaks down to the phosphoric acid and episulfide (Puech etal (1993) Antiviral Res., 22: 155-174; Benzaria etal (1996) /. Med. Chem. 39:4958). Cyclic phosphonate esters have also been described as prodrugs of phosphorus-containing compoimdG (Erion etal, US Patent No. 6312662).<br>
"Protecting group" refers to a moiety of a compound that masks or alters the properties of a functional group or the properties of the compound as a whole. The chemical substructure of a protecting group varies widely. One function of a protecting group is to serve as intermediates in the synthesis of the parental drug substance. Chemical protecting groups and strategies for protection/deprotection are well known in the art. See: "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Theodora W. Greene (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. Protecting groups are often utilized to mask the reactivity of certain functional groups, to assist in the efficiency of desired chemical reactions, e.g. making and breaking chemical bonds in an ordered and planned fashion. Protection of functional groups of a compound alters other physical properties besides the reactivity of the protected functional group, such as the polarity, lipophilicity (hydrophobicity), and other properties which can be measured by common analytical tools. Chemically protected intermediates may themselves be biologically active or inactive.<br>
Protected compounds may also exhibit altered, and in some cases, optimized properties in vitro and in vivo, such as passage through cellular membranes and resistance to enzymatic degradation or sequestration. In this role, protected compounds wife intended therapeutic effects may be referred to as prodrugs. Another function of a protecting group is to convert the parental drug into a prodrug, whereby the parental drug is released upon conversion of the prodrug in vivo. Because active prodrugs may be absorbed more effectively than the parental drug, prodrugs may possess greater potency in vivo than the parental drug. Protecting groups are removed either in vitro, in the instance of chemical intermediates, or in vivo, in the case of prodrugs. With chemical intermediates, it is not particularly important that the resulting products after deprotection, e.g. alcohols, be physiologically acceptable, although in general it is more desirable if the products are pharmacologically innocuous. Exemplary protecting groups include by way of example and<br>
drugs. These proesters contain an ethylthio group in which the tfaiol group is either esterified with an acyl group or combined with another thiol group to form a disulfide. Deesterification or reduction of the disulfide generates the fiee thio intermediate which subsequently breaks down to the phosphoric acid and episulfide (Puech etal (1993) Antiviral Res., 22:155-174; Benzaria etal (1996) J. Med. Chem. 39:4958). Cyclic phosphonate esters have also been described as prodrugs of phosphorus-containing compounds (Erion etal, US Patent No. 6312662).<br>

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral centers). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process: The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.<br>

Embodiments of Rx include esters, carbamates, carbonates, thioesters, amides, thioamides, and urea groups:<br>
(Figure Remove)The compounds of the invention may also include one or more prodrug moieties located as a covalently-attached substituent at any location or site, e.g. Ar, L, X, A, R1, R2, R3, R4, or the 9-hydroxyl. One substituent which may be modified as a prodrug moiety is a phosphonate, phosphate, phosphinate or other phosphorus functionality (Oliyai etal PJlarmaceutical Res. (1999) 16:1687-1693; Krise, J. and Stella, V. Adv. Drug Del Reviews (1996) 19:287-310; Bischofberger etal, U.S. Patent No. 5,798,340). Prodrug moieties of<br>
phosphorus functionality serve to mask anionic charges and decrease polarity. The phosphonate prodrug moiety may be an ester (Oliyai, etal Intl. Jour. Pharmaceutics (1999) 179:257-265), e.g. POC and POM (pivaloyloxymethyl, Yuan, etal Pharmaceutical Res. (2000) 17:1098-1103), or amidate which separates from the integrase inhibitor compound in vivo or by exposure in vitro to biological conditions, e.g. cells, tissue isolates. The separation may be mediated by general hydrolytic conditions, oxidation, enzymatic action or a combination of steps.<br>
Compounds of the invention bearing one or more prodrug moieties may increase or optimize the bioavailability of the compounds as therapeutic agents. For example, bioavailability after oral administration may be preferred and depend on resistance to metabolic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract or circulatory system, and eventual uptake inside cells. Prodrug moieties are considered to confer said resistance by slowing certain hydrolytic or enzymatic metabolic processes. Lipophilic prodrug moieties may also increase active or passive transport of the compounds of the invention across cellular membranes (Darby, G. Antiviral Chem. &amp; ChemotJierapy (1995) Supp. 1, 6:54-63).<br>

Another embodiment of the invention is directed toward an HIV integrase inhibitor tricyclic compound of the invention which is capable of accumulating in human PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). PBMC refer to blood cells having round lymphocytes and monocytes. Physiologically, PBMC are critical components of the mechanism against infection. PBMC may be isolated from heparinized whole blood of normal healthy donors or buffy coats, by standard density gradient centrifugation and harvested from the interface, washed (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline) and stored in freezing medium. PBMC may be<br>
cultured in multi-well plates. At various times of culture, supernatant may be either removed for assessment, or cells may be harvested and analyzed (Smith R. etal (2003) Blood 102(7):2532-2540). The compounds of this embodiment may further comprise a phosphonate or phosphonate prodrug. Typically, the phosphonate or phosphonate prodrug has the structure A3 as described herein.<br>
Optionally, the compounds of this embodiment demonstrate improved intracellular half-life of the compounds or intracellular metabolites of the compounds in human PBMC when compared to analogs of the compounds not having the phosphonate or phosphonate prodrug. Typically, the half-life is improved by at least about 50%, more typically at least in the range 50-100%, still more typically at least about 100%, more typically yet greater than about 100%.<br>
In another embodiment, the intracellular half-life of a metabolite of me compound in human PBMCs is improved when compared to an analog of the compound not having the phosphonate or phosphonate prodrug. la such embodiments, the metabolite may be generated intracellularly, or it is generated within human PBMC. The metabolite may be a product of the cleavage of a phosphonate prodrug within human PBMCs. The phosphonate prodrug may be cleaved to form a metabolite having at least one negative charge at physiological pH. The phosphonate prodrug may be enzymatically cleaved within human PBMC to form a phosphonate having at least one active hydrogen atom of the form P-OH.<br>
The compounds of the invention may have pre-organized binding modes which optimize the binding affinity of other, known HIV integrase inhibitors. During binding between the inhibitor and the active site of the target HTV integrase enzyme, the inhibitor may attain a low energy conformation (also called bound conformation) in order to interact within an active site. Generally, ligands of molecules with multiple rotational bonds exist in many potential conformational states, most of which are not able to bind to the active site. The greater the number of possible ligand conformations typically results in a greater decrease in efficiency of the entropy contribution to the free energy of binding, and will result in less favorable binding affinities. One aspect of designing pre-organized binding features in an integrase inhibitor compound is incorporating conformational constraints that reduces the total number of conformational states and places the inhibitor into a correct binding conformation (Lam, P.Y.S. et al. /. Ued. Chem, (1996) 39:3514-3525; Chen, J.M. et al. Biochemistry (1998) 37:17735-17744; Chen, J.M. et al. Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc. (2000) 122:9648-9654; Chen, J.M. et al US 6187907; Chen, et al Bio. Org. Ued, Chem.<br>
Letters (2002) 12:1195-1198). Knowledge of one or more preferred, i.e. low-energy, binding conformations is important for rational structure design and avoid inactive lead compounds.<br>
Those of skill in the art will also recognize that the compounds of the invention may exist in many different protonation states, depending on, among other things, the pH of their environment. While the structural formulae provided herein depict the compounds in only one of several possible protonation states, it will be understood that these structures are illustrative only, and that the invention is not limited to any particular protonation state-any and all protonated forms of the compounds are intended to fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention optionally comprise salts of the compounds herein,<br>
especially pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salts containing, for example, Na , Li , K â€¢ Ca   and Mg  . Such salts may include those derived by combination of appropriate cations such as alkali and alkaline earth metal ions or ammonium and quaternary ammo ions with an acid anion moiety, typically a carboxylic acid. The compounds of the invention may bear multiple positive or negative charges. The net charge of the compounds of the invention may be either positive or negative. Any associated counter ions are typically dictated by the synthesis and/or isolation methods by which the compounds are obtained. Typical counter ions include, but are not limited to ammonium, sodium, potassium, lithium, halides, acetate, trifluoroacetate, etc., and mixtures thereof. It will be understood mat the identity of any associated counter ion is not a critical feature of the invention, and mat the invention encompasses the compounds in association with any type of counter ion. Moreover, as the compounds can exists in a variety of different forms, the invention is intended to encompass not only forms of the compounds that are in association with counter ions (e.g., dry salts), but also forms that are not in association with counter ions (e.g., aqueous or organic solutions).<br>
Metal salts typically are prepared by reacting the metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts which are prepared in this way are salts containing Li+, Na+, and K+. A less soluble metal salt can be precipitated from the solution of a more soluble salt by addition of the suitable metal compound In addition, salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic and inorganic acids, e.g., HC1, HBr, H2SO4, HsPO4 or organic sulfonic acids, to basic centers, typically amines, or to acidic groups. Finally, it is to be understood that the compositions herein comprise compounds of<br>
the invention in their unionized, as well as zwitterioiric fonn, and combinations with stoichiometric amounts of water as in hydrates.<br>
Also included within the scope of this invention are the salts of the parental compounds with one or more amino acids, especially the naturally-occurring amino acids found as protein components. The amino acid typically is one bearing a side chain with a basic or acidic group, e.g., lysine, arginine or glutanric acid, or a neutral group such as glycine, serine, thrednine, alanine, isoleucine, or leucine.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also exist as tautomeric, resonance isomers in certain cases. Typically, the structures shown herein exemplify only one tautomeric or resonance form of the compounds. For example, hydrazine, oxime, hydrazone groups may be shown in either the syn or anti configurations. The corresponding alternative configuration is contemplated as well. All possible tautomeric and resonance forms are within the scope of the invention.<br>
One enantiomer of a compound of the invention can be separated substantially free of its opposing enantiomer by a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (1962) by E. L. Eliel, McGraw Hill; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) /. Chromatogr., 113:(3) 283-302). Separation of diastereomers formed from the racemic mixture can be accomplished by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure enantiomers. Alternatively, enantiomers can be separated directly under chiral conditions, method (3).<br>
Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, cc-methyl-p-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.<br>
Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved may be reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S.<br>
(1994) Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 322). Diasteieomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the free, enantiomerically enriched xanthene. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester or Mosher ester, cc-rcethoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob TO. (1982) /. Org. Cliem. 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric diastereomers. Stable diastereomers can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (Hoye, T., WO 96/15111).<br>
By method (3), a racemic mixture of two asymmetric enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase fChiral Liquid Chromatography (1989) W. J. l/jugh, Ed. Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, (1990) "Optical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by High-performance liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral stationary phase", /. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378).<br>
Enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.<br>
SYNTHESIS OF HTV-INTEGRASE INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes and methods known to those skilled in the art. The invention also relates to methods of making the compounds of the invention. The compounds are prepared by any of the applicable techniques of organic synthesis. Many such techniques are well known in the art. However, many of the known techniques are elaborated in: "Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Vol. 1, Ian T. Harrison and Shuyen Harrison, 1971; Vol. 2, Ian T. Harrison and Shuyen Harrison, 1974; Vol. 3, Louis S. Hegedus and Leroy Wade, 1977; Vol. 4, Leroy G. Wade, jr., 1980; Vol. 5, Leroy G. Wade, Jr., 1984; and Vol. 6, Michael B. Smith; as well as March, J., "Advanced Organic Chemistry", Third Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985; "Comprehensive Organic Synthesis. Selectivity, Strategy &amp; Efficiency hi Modern Organic Chemistry" (9 Volume set) Barry M. Trost, Editor-in-Chief, Pergamon Press, New York, 1993.<br>
A number of exemplary methods for the preparation of the compounds, Formulas I-IV, of the invention are provided herein. These methods are intended to illustrate the nature of such preparations are not intended to limit the scope of applicable methods.<br>
Deliberate use may be made of protecting groups to mask reactive functionality and direct reactions regioselectively (Greene, etal (1991)-"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons). For example, useful protecting groups for the 8-hydroxyl group and other hydroxyl substituents include methyl, MOM (methoxymethyl), trialkylsilyl, benzyl, benzoyl, trityl, and tetrahydropyranyl. Certain aryl positions maybe blocked from substitution, such as the 2-position as fluorine.<br>
Formula I compounds<br>
Exemplary methods of synthesis of Formula I compounds are described below in Schemes 1-10 and 15-17. One method of synthesis of Formula I compounds of the invention is cyclization of a succinimide compound with a pyridine dicarboxylate compound to give tricyclic compounds (Murray and Semple, Synthesis (1996) 11:80-82; Jones and Jones, Jour. Chem. Soc., Perkin Transactions I (1973) 26-32), according to Scheme 1.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Alternatively, a succinimide with a labile protecting group (P) on the nitrogen may be reacted with a pyridine dicarboxylate compound. P may be an acid-labile protecting group, such as trialkylsilyl. Trialkylsilyl groups may also be removed with fluoride reagents. After P is removed, a variety of Ar-L groups may be covalenfly attached, according to Scheme 2.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Imide compounds can be reduced with dissolving metal reducing agents, e.g. Zn, or hydride reagents, e.g. NaBHLt, to form a lactam. Exemplary regioselective conversions shown in Scheme 3 include:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Imide compounds may also be reduced to the hydroxylactam under mild conditions. Reductions with sodium borohydride and cerium, or samarium salts have been shown to proceed with regioselectivity on asymmetric imides (Mase, etal /. Chem, Soc. PerJdn Communication 1 (2002) 707-709), as in Scheme 4, upper. Grignard reagents and acetylenic anions (Chihab-Eddine, etal Tetraliedron Lett. (2001) 42:573-576) may also add with regioselectivity to an imide carbonyl to form alkyl-hydroxylactam compounds, as in Scheme 4, lower). The phenolic oxygen groups may be protected and deprotected as necessary to furnish yield reactions.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)Scheme 4<br>
Another synthetic route to the compounds of the invention proceeds through substituted quinoline intennediates (Clemence, etal U.S. Patent No. 5,324,839; Billhardt-Troughton, etal U.S. Patent No. 5,602,146; Matsumura, /. Amer. Chem. Soc. (1935) 57:124-128) having the general formula:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
5,8-Dihydroxy quinoline compounds may be elaborated according to Scheme 5:<br>
Scheme 6<br>
The cyclic anhydride below may be regioselectively esterified to give the compounds of the invention, for example via the route in Scheme 6 where MOM is methoxymethyl and X is, for example, C(=O), CRC(=O), C(=O)C(=O), and SO2. See Omstein, etal Jour. Med. Chem. (1989) 32:827-833. The same chemistry can be applied to the 5-memberedlactam synthesis to control the regiochemistry as in Scheme 7:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
A cyclic imide may be conveniently alkylated, acylated, or otherwise reacted to form a broad array of compounds with Ar-L groups:<br>
(Figure Remove)bromide (Ar = phenyl, L = CH2) or a sulfonating reagent, like 4-methoxyphenyl sulfonyl chloride (Ar = 4-methoxyphenyl, L = S(=O&gt;2. Alternatively, the Ar-L group may be attached by a multi step process. For example, the imide nitrogen may react with a sulfurizing reagent such as 2,2-dipyridyl disulfide to form an N-sulfide intermediate (Ar = 2-pyridyl, L = S). Such an intermediate may be further elaborated to a variety of Ar-L groups where L is S, S(=O) or S(=O&gt;2.<br>
Another synthetic route to the compounds of the invention proceeds through 7-substituted, 8-quinolinol intermediates (Zhuang, etal WO 02/36734; Vaillancourt, etal U.S. Patent No. 6,310,211; Hodel, U.S. Patent No. 3,113,135) having the general formulas, including aryl substituted compounds:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Annulation of the third, 5-7 membered ring can be conducted by appropriate selection of aryl substituents on the quinoline ring system, utilizing known synthetic transformations to give compounds of Formula I. For example, methods for coupling carboxylic acids and other activated acyl groups with amines to form cafboxamides are well known in the art (March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry. 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, pp. 370-376). An exemplary cyclization includes the following:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme 8 below shows another synthetic route to compounds of the invention, i.e. Formula I. This route proceeds by cyclization of a 2-O-protected, 3 halo-aniline compound with an o,p-unsaturated carbonyl compound to give a functionalized quinoline. The <x></x>
unsaturated carbonyl compound may be, for example, an aldehyde (X=H), ketone (X=R), ester (X=OR), amide (X=NR2), acyl halide (X=C1), or anhydride. Carbonylation via palladium catalysis can give an ester which may be elaborated to the amide functionality and cyclization to form a 5,6, or 7 membered ring. The R group of phenolic oxygen may be a labile protecting group, e.g. trialkylsilyl or tetrahydropyranyl, which may be removed at a step in the synthetic route, or it may be a substituent which is retained in the putative integrase inhibitor compound.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)Halo quinoline intermediates may undergo a flexible array of nucleophilic aromatic substitutions and Suzuki-type reactions, as shown in Scheme 9 below. Suzuki coupling of aryl halide compounds with acetylenic and vinylic palladium complexes are carbon-carbon bond forming reactions under relatively mild conditions. In some instances it may be necessary to block the 2 position to direct reaction at the desired aryl position.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Formula I compounds with a 5,9-dihydroxy-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoline-6,8-dione were prepared by selective protection of the C9 phenol in 5,9-dihydroxy-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolme-6,8-dione. The C9 phenol was protected with a TIPS group and the C5 phenol could then be alkylated or acylated (Scheme 10).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The acid 1 (WO02/30930, p.173) may be reacted with amine 2 (prepared according to the methods described by T. Morie, et al, Chem. Pharrn. Bull., 42 ,1994, 877-882; D. Wenninger, et al, Nucleosides Nucleotides, 16 ,1997,977-982) by the method of peptide coupling such as described in WO02/30930, p. 173 to form amide 3. Bromination with<br>
NBS generates compound 4. The phenol is protected with a bulky acyl group such as pivaloyl. Displacement of bromine at C5 of naphmyridine by Bis-boc protected hydrazine is achieved using the method reported by JJB. Artebum, et al, Org. Lett., 3,2001,1351-1354. The silyl protecting group is removed by TBAF (T. Green and P. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", p. 142, Wiley Science, 1999) and mesylate 7 is formed by reacting the alcohol formed with methanesulfonyl chloride. Treatment of compound 7 with TFA followed by heating hydrazino mesylate in the basic condition affords hydrazono triaza anthracene 8. (Figure Remove)<br>
Compound 8 is converted to many different derivatives, e.g. carbazones 9 (R1 = COR3) are generated by reaction with acid chlorides or activated carboxylic acids. Carbamates 9 (R1 = COOR3) ate obtained upon reaction of 8 with chloro formates<br>
C1COOR3. Semicarbazones 9 (R1 = CONR2R3) are formed using isocyanates orN,N-<br>
dialkyl chloroformaides. Thiosemicarbazones 9 (R1 = CSNR^4) are generated with thioisocyanates. Sulfonyl ureas 9 (R1 = SC&gt;2NR3R4) are obtained by reaction of 8 with sulfamoyl chlorides using procedures reported by M.L. Matier, et al, J. Med. Chem., 15, 1972,538-541. The simple sulfonamides are produced when 8 reacts with sulfonyl chlorides. The ester group in compounds 9 is removed upon saponification to give compound 10.<br>
Alternatively, many of hydrazone derivatives 9 are subjected to alkylation followed by saponification to afford compounds 11.<br>
(Figure Remove)Compound 5 from Scheme 11 is reacted with a substituted hydroxyamine or amine (R5=Boc; R = ORa or alkyl) in a manner similar to that described by L.A., Carpino et al, Org. Lett., 3,2001, 2793-2795 to give derivative 12. After transforming the silyl protected hydroxyl in 12 to a leaving group such as the mesylate in 13, cyclization is accomplished in<br>
the heating condition and the presence of a base to afford compound 14. Final deprotection by hydrolysis of 14 gives compound 15. (Figure Remove)<br><br>
When R6 in 14 is OR", or where Ra can be removed, oxime 16 is obtained and can be functionalized with many reagents to yield compound 17. Hydrolysis of ester group affords 18. For example, when 16 is treated with an alkyl halide (R7-X) or an alcohol under Mitsunobu condition, an ether 18 is formed. When an isocyanate or thioisocyanate is applied, a carbamate or thiocarbamate 18 (R7: C(=O)NHR8 or C(=S)NHR8) is generated. An N,N-disubstitued carbamate 18 (R7: C(=O)NR2R3) is obtained when a chloroformate C1C(=O)NR2R3 is reacted with 16. Similarly, treating 16 with a sulfamoyl chlorides affords a sulfamate 18 (R7: SO2NR1R2).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme 15 depicts one of the methods to prepare a spiro-cyclopropane-contauirng lactam fused to quinoline, an embodiment of Formula I. A differentially protected phenol 19 is used where R8 can be a removable ether group such as trimethylsilyethyl ether and R9 can be a bulky group such as diphenylmethyl or t-butyl ether. The carbonyl of C6 is converted to an olefin regioselectively by treating 19 with methylmagnesium bromide followed by dehydration of aminal to give 20. Carbene insertion by Simmons-Smith reaction (for example, Y. Biggs et al, JOG, 57,1992, 5568-5573) produces cyclopropane 21. Selective removal of R8 by TBAF followed by fuctionalization using the methods described in many examples leads to compound 24.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
A dimethyl substituted lactam can be prepared by reacting 19 with a Grignard reagent followed by converting aminal 25 to acetate 26 and treating 26 with Me3Al/IMSOTf, a method reported by C.U. Kim, et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 35,1994, 3017-3020, to afford 27. An alternative method can be used by reducing cyclopropane 21 with Pt02/H2 as reported by O.K. Cheung et al, JOG, 54,1989,570-573, to give 27.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Another version of modified lactam can be obtained according to Scheme 17. Treating 19 with an allyl Grignard reagent gives 30. Activating aminal 30 by forming acetate 31 followed by treating 31 with allyl trimethylsilane mediated by a Lewis acid such as TMSOTf affords 32. Cyclization can be achieved by using Grubb's RCM (ring closure metathesis) method (P. Schwab et al, Angew. Chem. Intl. 34,1995, 2039). Alternatively, the tenninal olefins in 32 can be converted to aldehydes and reductive amination leads to a spiro-piperidine.<br>

Many tricyclic compounds can bear a heterocycle different from 9-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-8-one, i.e. Formula IV. Some examples and methods to prepare Formula IV compounds are depicted in Schemes 18-24 above.<br>
Preparation of the intermediate phosphonate esters laa - FVcc.<br>
The structures of the intermediate phosphonate esters laa to IVcc are shown in Chart 1, in which the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, A1 and A2 are as previously defined. groups Ala and A2a are the same as the groups A1 and A2, except that a substituent link-<br>
P(O)(OR5)2 is appended The substituent R5 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyi, aralkyl, or aryl. Subsequent chemical modifications to the compounds laa to Vcc, as described herein, permit the synthesis of the final compounds of this invention.<br>
The intermediate compounds laa to IVcc incorporate a phosphonate moiety (R5O)2P(O) connected to the nucleus by means of a variable linking group, designated as "link" in the attached structures. Chart 2 illustrates examples of the taking groups present in the structures laa - IVcc.<br>
Schemes Al - A33 illustrate the syntheses of the intermediate phosphonate compounds of this invention, laa - IVcc, and of the intermediate compounds necessary for their synthesis.<br>
The methods described for the introduction of phosphonate substituents are, with modifications made by one skilled in the art, transferable within the substrates I - V. For example, reaction sequences which produce the phosphonates laa are, with appropriate modifications, applicable to the preparation of the phosphonates Ilaa, niaa, or IVaa. Methods described below for the attachment of phosphonate groups to reactive substituents such as OH, NH2f CHaBr, COOH, CHO etc are applicable to each of the scaffolds I - V.<br>

Depending on the reaction conditions employed, it may be necessary to protect certain reactive substituents from unwanted reactions by protection before the sequence described, and to deprotect the substituents afterwards, according to the knowledge of one skilled in the art. Protection and deprotection of functional groups are described, for example, in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Wiley, Second Edition 1990. Reactive substituents which may be protected are shown in the accompanying schemes as, for example, [OH], [SEQ, etc.<br>

Schemes Al - AS illustrate methods for the preparation of the intermediate phosphonate esters laa.<br>
As shown in Scheme Al, the phenolic hydroxyl substitaent present in the tricyclic compound Al.l is protected to afford the derivative A1.2. The protection of hydroxyl groups is described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Wiley, Second Edition 1990, p. 10. For example, hydroxyl substituents are protected as trialkylsilyloxy, methoxymethyl, benzyl or tert-butyl ethers. Trialkylsilyl groups are introduced by the reaction of the phenol with a chlorotrialkylsilane and a base such as imidazole, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Wiley, Second Edition 1990, p. lOff. The protected product Al.2 is then reacted, in the presence of a strong base, with a bromoalkyl phosphonate A1.3, to<br>
give the alkylation product A1.4. The reaction is effected in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran and the like, in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride, an alkali metal alkoxide, lithium hexamethyldisilazide, and the like, at from ambient temperature to about 100"C, to yield the alkylated product A1.4. The phenolic hydroxyl group is then deprotected to afford the phenol A1.5. Methods for the deprotection of hydroxyl groups are described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Wiley, Second Edition 1990, p. lOff.<br>
For example, 7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-9-hydroxy-5H-l,7-diaza-anthracene-6,8-dione A1.6 is reacted with one molar equivalent of chlorotiiisopropylsilane and imidazole in dimethylformamide at ambient temperature, as described in Tet Lett, 2865,1974, to produce 7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-9-triisopropylsilanyloxy-5H-l,7-diaza-anthracene-6,8-dione A1.7. The product is then reacted in dimethylformamide solution at about 60Â°C with one . molar equivalent of a dialkyl 2-bromoethyl phosphonate A1.8 (Aldrich) and lithium hexamethyldisilazide, to yield the alkylated product A1.9. The silyl protecting group is then removed by reaction with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, as described in J. Org. Chem., 51,4941,1986, to give the phenolic product A1.10.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the 4-fluorobenzyl-substituted phenol A1.6, different phenols A1.1 and/or different phosphonates A1.3, the corresponding products A1.5 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A2 illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure laa in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an aryl of heteroaryl ring.<br>
In this procedure, a hydroxy-substituted phthalimide derivative A2.1 (Formula I) is protected, as described above, to afford the product A2.2. This compound is then reacted with a bromoaryl magnesium bromide Grignard reagent A23, in which the group Ar! is an aromatic or heteroaromatic group such as, for example, benzene or thiophene, to afford the caibinol A2.4. The regioselective addition of organometallic derivatives to phthalimides is described in Scheme 4. The reaction is performed between approximately equimolar amounts of the reactants in an ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like, at from -40Â°C to ambient temperature, to give the carbinol product A2.4. This material is then reacted with a dialkyl phosphite A2.5 and a palladium catalyst, to give the phosphonate A2.6. The preparation of arylphosphonates by means of a coupling reaction between aryl bromides and dialkyl phosphites is described in J. Med. Chem., 35,1371,<br>
1992. The reaction is conducted in a hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, at about 100Â°C, in the presence of a palladium (0) catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), and a tertiary base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine. The hydroxyl group is then deprotected to yield the phenolic product A2.7. Optionally, the benzylic hydroxyl substituent in the product A2.7 is removed by means of a reductive procedure, as shown on Scheme 4. Benzylic hydroxyl groups are removed by catalytic hydrogenation, for example by the use of 10% palladium on carbon in the presence of hydrogen or a hydrogen donor, or by means of chemical reduction, for example employing triethylsilane and boron trifluoride etherate.<br>
For example, 7-(3,5-dichloro-benzyl)-5,9-bis-triisopropylsilanyIoxy-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoline-6,8-dione A2.9, prepared by silylation of the corresponding diol, which is reacted with one molar equivalent of 4-bromophenyl magnesium bromide A2.10 in ether at 0Â°C to produce the carbinol A2.ll. The latter compound is then reacted, in toluene solution at reflux, with a dialkyl phosphite A2.5, triethylamine .and<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), as described in J. Med. Chem., 35,1371,1992, to afford the phosphonate product A2.12. Desilylation, for example by reaction with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride, gives the diol product A2.13. Optionally, the product A2.12 is reduced, for example by reaction in dichloromethane solution at ambient temperature with ca. four molar equivalents of triethylsilane and boron trifluoride etherate, as described in Example 18 to yield after deprotection the reduced product A2.14.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the 3,5-dichlorobenzyl-substituted phenol derivative A2.9, different phenol derivatives A2.1 and/or different bromoaryl Grignard reagents A2.3, the corresponding products A2.7 and A2.8 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A3 illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure laa in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an alkylene chain.<br>
In this sequence, a 6-aminoquinoline ester A3.1, prepared, for example, from the corresponding carboxylic acid by means of a Curtius rearrangement, (Advanced Organic " Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p.646) is reacted, under reductive amination conditions, with a dialkyl formylalkyl phosphonate A3J2. The preparation of amines by means of reductive amination procedures is described, for example, in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, p 421, and in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p 269. In this procedure, the amine component and the aldehyde or ketone component are<br>
reacted together in the presence of a reducing agent such as, for example, borane, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride or diisobutylaluminum hydride, optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as titanium tetraisopropoxide, as described in J. Org. Chem., 55,2552,1990. The product A3.3 is then converted, by reaction with the amine ArBNHa A3.4, or a derivative thereof, into the amide A3.5. The conversion of esters into amides is described in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p. 987. The reactants are combined in the presence of a base such as sodium methoxide under azeotropic conditions, or of a dialkyl aluminum or trialkyl tin derivative of the amine. The use of trimethylaluminum in the conversion of esters to amides is described in J. Med. Chem. Chim. Ther., 34,1999,1,995, and Syn. Comm., 25,1401,1995. The reaction is conducted in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene. The amide product A3.5 is then cyclized by reaction with a reagent such as phosgene or a functional equivalent thereof, such as triphosgene or a dialkyl carbonate, or a reagent such as diiodomethane, to give the cyclized product A3.6 in which D is CO or CHfe. The reaction is conducted in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of an inorganic or organic base such as potassium carbonate or diisopropylethylamine.<br>
For example, the amine A3.7, prepared by means of a Curtius rearrangement of the corresponding MOM-protected carboxylic acid, is reacted in isopropanol solution with a dialkyl fonnylmethyl phosphonate A3.8, prepared as described in Zh. Obschei. Khun., 1987, 57, 2793, sodium cyanoborohydride and acetic acid, to give the reductive amination product A3.9. The product is then reacted with an excess of 3,4-dichlorobenzylamine and sodium methoxide in toluene at reflux, to yield the amide A3.10. The latter compound is then reacted with one molar equivalent of triphosgene and N,N-dmernylanainopyridine in dichloromethane, to afford the cyclized product A3.ll. The MOM protecting groups are then removed, for example by reaction with a catalytic amount of methanolic hydrogen chloride, as described in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm., 298,1974, to give the dihydroxy product A3.12.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the amine A3.7, different amines A3.1, and/or different aldehydes A3.2, and/or different amines A3.4, the corresponding products A3.6 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A4 illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure laa in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an alkylene chain or an aryl, heteroaryl or aralkyl group and a heteroatom O, S or N. In this sequence, a tricyclic arninal<br>
A4.1 is reacted in the presence of an acid catalyst with a hydroxy, mercapto or amino-substituted dialkyl phosphonate A4.2 in which X is O, S, NH or N-alkyl, and R is alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl or aralkyl. The reaction is effected at ambient temperature in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, in the presence of an acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an excess of the reagent A4.2. The hydroxyl group is then de-protected to yield the phenolic product A4.4.<br>
For example, 7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-9-triisopropylsilanyloxy-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-8-one A4.5 (Example 20, Scheme 15) is reacted at ambient temperature in dichloromethane solution with a dialkyl 2-mercaptoethyl phosphonate A4.6 (Zh. Obschei. Khim., 1973,43, 2364) and trifluoroacetic acid to give the thioether product A4.7, which upon deprotection with tetrabutylammonium fluoride yields the phenol A4.8.<br>
As a further example, 6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-7-(4-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-9-triisopropylsilanyloxy-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoIin-8-one A4.9, prepared analogously to the 4-fluoro analog A4.5, is reacted, under the same conditions, with a dialkyl 3-mercaptophenyl phosphonate A4.10 to give the thioether A4.ll which upon deprotection affords the phenol A4.12. The phosphonate reagent A4.10 is obtained by palladium (0) catalyzed coupling reaction, as described in Scheme A2, between a dialkyl phosphite and an S-protected derivative of 3-bromothiophenol, for example the S-trityl derivative, followed by removal of the sulfur protecting group. Protection and deprotection of thiols is described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Wiley, Second Edition 1990, p. 277.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the carbinols A4.5 and A4.9, different carbinols A4.1, and/or different alcohols, thiols or amines A4.2, the corresponding products A4.4 are obtained.<br>
Scheme AS illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure laa in which the phosphonate group is attached to a 7-membered ring by means of an alkylene or arylmethylene chain. In this sequence, a suitable protected quinoline acid ester A5.1 is subjected to a Curtius rearrangement, as described in Scheme A3 to yield the amine AS.2. The product is then reductively aminated, as described in Scheme A3, with a phosphonate aldehyde A5.3, in which the group R is an alkyl group or an aryl group, to give the amine product A5.4. This material is then coupled with the glycine derivative A5.5 to yield the amide A5.6. The preparation of amides from carboxylic acids and derivatives is described,<br>
for example, in Organic Functional Group Preparations, by S.R.Sandler and W. Kara, Academic Press, 1968, p. 274, and Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p. 972ff. The carboxylic acid is reacted with the amine in the presence of an activating agent, such as, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide, optionally in the presence of, for example, hydroxybenztriazole, N-hydroxysuccinimide or N-hydroxypyridone, in a non-protic solvent such as, for example, pyridine, DMF or dichloromethane, to afford the amide. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid may first be converted into an activated derivative such as the acid chloride, anhydride, mixed anhydride, imidazolide and the like, and then reacted with the amine, in the presence of an organic base such as, for example, pyridine, to afford the amide. The conversion of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding acid chloride can be effected by treatment of the carboxylic acid with a reagent such as, for example, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane, optionally hi the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide. The product A5.6 is then cyclized, for example by heating at reflux temperature in toluene in the presence of a basic catalyst such as sodium methoxide, or by reaction with trimethylaluminum, as described in Syn. Comm., 25,1401, 1995, to afford after deprotection of the hydroxyl groups, the diazepindione derivative A5.7.<br>
For example, the MOM-protected amine A3.7 is reductively aminated by reaction with a dialkyl phosphonoacetaldehyde A5.8 (Aurora) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride, to produce the amine A5.9. The product is then coupled in dimethylformamide solution, in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, with (4-fluoro-benzylamino)-acetic acid A5.10, to give the amide A5.ll. This material is converted, by reaction with trimethylalumhium in dichloromethane, as described above, into the diazepin derivative A5.12. Removal of the MOM protecting groups, as previously described, then affords the phenolic product A5.13.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the amine A3.7, different amines A5.2, and/or different aldehydes A5.3, and/or different carboxylic acids A5.5, the corresponding products A5.7 are obtained.<br>

Schemes A6 - A16 illustrate methods for the preparation of the phosphonate esters of general structure Ibb.<br>
Scheme A6 depicts two methods for the preparation of phosphonate esters hi which the phosphonate group is linked by means of a saturated or unsaturated alkylene chain, or alkylene chains incorporating carbocyclic, aryl or heteroaryl rings. In this procedure, a mono-protected phenol A6.1, for example, is reacted either with a bromo-substituted alkyl phosphonate A6.2, in which the group R is alkylene, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl, heterarylalkyl and the like, or with an analogous hydroxyl-substituted dialkyl phosphonate A63. The reaction between the phenol and the bromo compound A6.2 is conducted in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, and optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium<br>
iodide, to afford the ether product A6.4. Alternatively, the ether compounds A6.4 are obtained by means of a Mitsonobu reaction between the phenol A6.1 and the hydroxy compound A6.3. The preparation of aromatic ethers by means of the Mitsonobu reaction is described, for example, in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p. 448, and in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 153-4 and in Gig. React., 1992,42,335. The phenol and the alcohol component are reacted together in an aprotic solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a dialkyl azodicarboxylate and a triarylphosphine, to afford the ether or thioether products. The procedure is also described in Org. React, 1992, 42,335-656. Deprotection of the phenolic hydroxyl group then affords the phenol A6.5.<br>
For example, 7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-5-hydroxy-9-triethylsilanyloxy-pyrrolot3,4-g]quinoline-6,8-dione A6.6, (Example 12, Scheme 11) is reacted at ambient temperature in dimethoxyethane solution with one molar equivalent of a dialkyl 4-bromo-2-butenylphosphonate Ad.7 (J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35,1371) and potassium carbonate, to yield the ether product A6.8, which upon deprotection with tetrabutylammonium fluoride gives the phenol A6.9.<br>
As a further example, 7-[2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-ethyI]-5-hydroxy-9-triethyIsilanyloxy-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoline-6,8-dione A6.10 prepared by analogous procedures to those shown is reacted in tetrahydrofuran solution with a dialkyl 3-hydroxypropyl phosphonate A6.ll (Acros), diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine, to afford the ether product A6.12 which upon deprotection gives the phenol A6.13.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the phenols A6.6 and A6.10, the phenols A6.1, and/or different bromides A6.2, or alcohols A6.3, the corresponding products A6.5 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A7 illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate is linked by means of an aryl or a heteroaryl group.<br>
m this procedure, a mono-protected phenol A7.1 (Formula I) is converted into the triflate A7.2 by reaction, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, with lifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride or anhydride, or with trimethylsilyl triflate and liethylsilane, in each case in the presence of a tertiary base such as triethylamine. The jriflate is then coupled with a bromo-substituted arylboronate A7.3, in which the group Ar1 is an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety, to afford the coupled product A7.4. The Suzuki coupling of aryl triflates and aryl boronic acids is described in Palladium Reagents and<br>
Catalysts by J. Tsuji, Wiley 1995, p 218. Hie reactants are combined in an inert solvent such as toluene or dioxan, in the presence of a palladium (0) catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and a base such as sodium bicarbonate. The coupled product A7.4 is then reacted, as described previously (Scheme A2) with a dialkyl phosphite A7.5, to give the phosphonate ester A7.6, which upon deprotection yields the phenol A7.7.<br>
For example, trifluoro-methanesulfonic acid 9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4-fluoro~benzyl)-S-oxo-T.S-dJhyaro-dH-pyrrolop^-gJqmnolin-S-yl ester A7.8 (Example 46) is reacted in dioxan solution at 70Â°C with one molar equivalent of 3-bromophenyl boronic acid A7.9 (Maybridge), sodium bicarbonate and a catalytic amount of tri-(o-tolyl)phosphine, to produce the coupled compound A7.10. This material is, then reacted, as described in Scheme A2, with a dialkyl phosphite and a palladium (0) catalyst, to give the phosphonate product A7.10. Removal of the benzhydryl protecting group, for example by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid and anisole in dichloromethane, as described hi Tet. Lett., 25,3909, 1984, then affords the phenol A7.ll.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the phenol A7.8, the phenol A7.1, and/or different boronic acids A7.3, the corresponding products A7.7 are obtained.<br>
Scheme AS illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in<br>
which the phosphonate group is linked by means of a oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen and an<br>
aliphatic or aromatic moiety.	'<br>
In this method, a monoprotected phenol A8.1 (Formula I) is converted into the corresponding triflate A8.2, as described above (Scheme A7). The product is then subjected to a nucleophilic displacement reaction with various carbinols, thiols or amines A83, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to afford after deprotection the ether, thioether or amine products A8.4. The displacement reaction is performed in an inert solvent such as dichloroethane or dioxan, at from ambient temperature to about 80Â°C, in the presence of a tertiary organic base such as N-methyl morpholine and the like.<br>
For example, trifluoro-methanesulfonic acid 9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4'fluoro-benzyl)-6,8-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrro]o[3,4-g]quinolin-5-yl ester A8.5 (Example 56) is reacted in dioxan at 50Â°C with one molar equivalent of a dialkyl methylaminomethyl phosphonate A8.6 and diisopropylethylamine, to give the amine product A8.7. Deprotection then affords the phenol A8.8.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the triflate A8.5, different triflates A8.2, and/or different carbinols, thiols or amines A8.3, the corresponding products A8.4 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A9 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a methylamino group and a carbon link R, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety. The compounds are obtained by means of a reductive alkylation reaction, as described above (Scheme A3) between the aldehyde A9.1, prepared by the method shown in Example 49, and a dialkyl aminoalkyl or aryl phosphonate A9.2. The animation product A9.3 is then deprotected to give the phenol A93.<br>
For example, 9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoline-5-carbaldehyde A9.5 (Example 49) is reacted with a dialkyl aminopropyl phosphonate A9.6 (Acros), sodium cyanoborohydride and acetic acid in isopropanol to yield the amination product A9.7, which is deprotected to produce the phenol A9.8.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the aldehyde A9
aldehydes A9.1, and/or different amines A9.2, the corresponding products A9.4 are<br>
obtained.	â€¢<br>
Scheme A10 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an amide linkage and a carbon fink R, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, araflcyl or heteroaryl moiety. In this sequence, the aldehyde A10.1, prepared, for example, as shown in Example 49 is oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid A10.2. The conversion of an aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid is described in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p. 838. The reaction is effected by the use of various oxidizing agents such as, for example, potassium permanganate, ruthenium tetroxide, silver oxide or sodium chlorite. The carboxylic acid is then coupled, as described in Scheme A5, with an amine A10.3 to afford the amide, which upon deprotection gives the phenolic amide A10.4.<br>
For example, 9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4-chloro-benzyl)-6,8-dioxo-7,8-dihydio-6H-pyrrolo [3,4-g]quinoline-5-carbaldehyde A10.5, prepared using the methods described in Example 49, is treated with silver oxide in acetonitrile, as described in Tet Lett., 5685, 1968, to produce the corresponding carboxylic acid 9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4-chloro-benzyl)-<br>
6,8-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoline-5-carboxylic acid A10.6. This material is then coupled, in dimethylfonnamide solution, with one molar equivalent of a dialkyl aminoethyl phosphonate A10.7 (Aurora) and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, to afford the amide, which upon deprotection gives the phenolic product A10.8.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the aldehyde A10.5, different aldehydes A10.1, and/or different pmines A10.3, the corresponding products A10.4 are obtained.<br>
Scheme AH depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a methylene group. In this procedure, a hydroxymethyl-substituted O-protected phenol All.l, prepared by the method shown in Example 50, is converted into the corresponding bromomethyl derivative A11.2. The conversion of alcohols into the corresponding bromides is described, for example, in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p. 356ff. For example, benzyl alcohols can be transformed into the bromo compounds by reaction with bromine and triphenyl phosphite, or by reaction with trimethylsilyl chloride and lithium bromide, or with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine, as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 92, 2139,1970. The resultant bromomethyl compound A11.2 is treated wim a trialkyl phosphite All.3 in an Arbuzov reaction. The preparation of phosphonates by means of the Arbuzov reaction is described in Handb. Organophosphorus Chem., 1992,115-72. The bromo compound is heated with an excess of the phosphite at from about 80Â°C-130Â°C to produce the phosphonate product, which upon deprotection affords the phenolic phosphonate A11.4.<br>
For example, 9-benzhydryloxy-5-hydroxymethyl-7-(4-methoxy-benzyl)-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoh'n-8-one A11.5 prepared by the method shown in Example 50, is reacted in dichloromethane with one molar equivalent of carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine to produce 9-benzhydryloxy-5-bromomethyl-7-(4-methoxy-benzyl)-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-8-one A11.6. The product is then heated at 120*C with an excess of a trialkyl phosphite All.3. The resulting phosphonate is then deprotected to afford the phenolic product A11.7.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the carbinol AILS, different carbinols All.l, and/or different phosphites All.3, the corresponding products All.4 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A12 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a methyleneoxy and a variable alkyl moiety. In this procedure, a protected hydroxymethyl-substituted tricyclic phenol A12.1 prepared according to the procedure of Example 50, is alkylated with a dialkyl bromo-substituted phosphonate A12.2, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated allcylcne, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety. The carbinol is reacted with one molar equivalent of the bromo compound in a polar aprotic organic solvent such as dimethylacetamide, dioxan and the like, in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride, lithium hexamethyldisilazide, or potassium tert. butoxide. The thus-obtained ether A12.3 is then deprotected to give the phenol A12.4.<br>
For example, 9-beri2Jiydryloxy-7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-5-hydroxymethyl-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-8-one A12.5 (Example 50) is treated in dimeraylformarnide solution at ambient temperature with one molar equivalent of lithium hexamethyldisilazide, followed by one molar equivalent of a dialkyl 4-(bromomethyl)benzyl phosphonate A12.6 (TeL, 1998,54,9341) to yield the alkylated product A12.7. Deprotection then gives the phenol A12.8.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the carbinol A12J5, different carbinols A12.1, and/or different bromo compounds A12.2, the corresponding products A12.4 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A13 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an aryl or heteroaryl ethenyl or ethyl linkage. In this procedure, a vinyl-substituted OH-protected phenol A13.1, prepared by the method shown hi Example 59, is coupled in a palladium-catalyzed Heck reaction with a dibromo-substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic reagent A13.2, in which the group Ar1 is an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring. The coupling of aryl halides with olefins by means of the Heck reaction is described, for example, in Advanced Organic Chemistry, by F. A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 503ff and in Ace. Chem. Res., 12,146,1979. The aryl bromide and the olefin are coupled in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide or dioxan, in the presence of a palladium(O) catalyst such as<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) or a palladium(n) catalyst such as palladnnn(n) acetate, and optionally in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or potassium carbonate. The coupled product A13.3 is then reacted, as described in Scheme A7, with a dialkyl phosphite A13.4 and a palladium catalyst, to afford, after deprotection of the<br>
phenolic hydroxyl, the ethenyl phosphonate ester A13.5. Catalytic or chemical reduction of the product then yields the saturated analog A13.6. The reduction reaction is effected chemically, for example by the use of diimide or diborane, as described in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p. 5, or catalytically, for example by the use of a palladium on carbon catalyst in the presence of hydrogen or a hydrogen donor.<br>
For example, 9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-5-vinyl-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-8-one A13.7 (Example 59) is reacted in dimethylformamide with 2,5-dibromothiophene A13.8 and a catalytic amount of palladium (II) acetate and triethylamine, to give (the coupled product A13.9. This material is then coupled with a dialkyl phosphite, as described above, to afford after deprotection of the phenol, the ethenyltbienyl phosphonate A13.10. The latter compound is reacted with diimide, prepared by basic hydrolysis of diethyl azodicarboxylate, as described in Angew. Chem. Int Ed, 4,271, 1965, to yield the saturated product A13.ll.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the vinyl-substituted compound A13.7, different analogs A13.1, and/or different dibromo compounds A13.2, the corresponding products A13.5 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A14 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an alkoxy chain incorporating an amide linkage. In this procedure, a mono-protected phenol A14.1 (Example 6) is alkylated with a methyl bromoalkyl carboxylate A14.2. The alkylation reaction is conducted under similar conditions to those described in Scheme A6, to afford the ester ether A14.3. Hydrolysis of the ester group then gives the carboxylic acid A14.4. Hydrolysis methods for converting esters into carboxylic acids are described, for example, in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, by R. C. Larock, VCH, 1989, p 981. The methods include toe use of enzymes such as pig liver esterase, and chemical methods such as the use of alkali metal hydroxides in aqueous organic solvent mixtures, for example lithium hydroxide in an aqueous organic solvent.<br>
The resultant carboxylic acid is then coupled, as described in Scheme AID, with a dialkyl amino-substituted phosphonate A14.5, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to produce the amide A14.6. Deprotection then yields the phenol A14.7.<br>
For example, 54iydroxy-9-methoxymethoxy-7-(4-methyl-benzyl)-pyirolo[3,4-g]quinoline-6,8-dione A14.8, prepared, for example, by the method shown in Example 6 is reacted in dimethylformamide solution with methyl bromoacetate A14.9 and cesium carbonate, to give the ether A14.10. The ester group is then hydrolyzed by reaction with one molar equivalent of lithium hydroxide in aqueous glyme, to produce the carboxylic acid A14.ll. The carboxylic acid is then coupled in dimethylformamide solution in the presence of diisopropyl carbodiimide with a dialkyl 2-aminoethyl phosphonate A14.12, (J. Org. Chem., 2000, 65, 676) to form the amide A14.13. Deprotection, for example by the use of 50% aqueous acetic acid containing a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid, as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 55,3040,1933, then affords the phenol A14.14.'<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the phenol A14.8, different phenols A14.1, and/or different bromoesters A14.2, and/or different amines A14.5, the corresponding products A14.7 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A15 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an alkylene chain incorporating an amide linkage. In this procedure, the malonic ester derivative of a protected phenol A15.1, prepared, for example, by the methods shown in Example 86, is hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to give the corresponding acetic acid derivative A15.2. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of malonic esters is described, for example, in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 15. The ester hydrolysis is effected under conventional basic conditions, and decarboxylation occurs after acidification either spontaneously or under mild heating. The resultant acetic acid derivative is then coupled, as described previously, with a dialkyl ammo-substituted phosphonate A15.3, to give the amide product which upon deprotection affords the phenol A15.4.<br>
For example, 2-[9-benzhydryloxy-7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-5-yl]-malonic acid dimethyl ester A15.5 (Example 86) is reacted at ambient temperature with two molar equivalents of lithium hydroxide in aqueous dimethoxyethane, and the reaction mixture is then acidified to pH 4.0 and heated at reflux to effect decarboxylation and production of the acetic acid derivative A15.6. The carboxylic acid is then coupled in acetonitrile solution in the presence of a water-soluble carbodiimide with a dialkyl 4-aminophenyl phosphonate A15.7 (Epsilon) to yield after deprotection the phenolic amide A15.8.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the malonic ester A15.5, different malonic esters A15.1, and/or different amines A15.3, the corresponding products A15.4 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A16 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ibb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of an alkoxy chain and the nucleus incorporates a beniazepin moiety. In this procedure, a quinoline monoester A16.1 is decarboxylated to afford the ester A16.2. Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids is described in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 676 and in Advanced Organic Chemistry, By J. Marsh, McGraw Hill, 1968, p. 435. The carboxylic acid is decarboxylated thermally in the presence of copper powder and quinoline, or by conversion to an ester with N-hydroxyphthalimide or N-hydroxythiopyridine, followed by photolysis in the presence of a hydrogen donor. The decarboxylated product A16.2 is then converted into the allyl ether A16.3 by reaction with allyl bromide in a polar solvent such as dimethylf ormamide in the presence of a base such h as triethylamine or potassium carbonate. The allyl ester is then subjected to a thermal Claisen rearrangement to afford the allyl-substituted phenol A16.4. The Claisen rearrangement of allyl aryl ethers is described in Advanced Organic Chemistry, By J. Marsh, McGraw Hill, 1968, p. 830 and in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 394. The reaction is conducted in a high-boiling solvent or without solvent at ca. 200Â°C. The free phenolic hydroxyl group is then protected to yield the doubly protected product A16.5. The latter compound is then subjected to a hydroboration procedure to afford the carbinol A16.6. Hydroboration of alkenes is described, for example, in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 226. The olefin is reacted with diborane or a substituted borane such as 9-BBN or catechyl borane, and the resulting borane is oxidized, for example with hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, sodium peroxycarbonate or a tertiary amine oxide. The resultant carbinol A16.6 is then converted into the substituted amine A16.7. The conversion is effected in two stages. In the first step, the carbinol is converted into a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate or bromide by reaction with, for example, methanesulfonyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride or triphenylphosphine/carbon tetrabromide. Li the second step, the activated intermediate is reacted in a polar solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidinone or acetonitrile with the amine ArBNHa to give the product A16.7. The aminoester is then cyclized to yield the azepin derivative A16.8. The cyclization reaction is performed under similar conditions to those<br>
described above (Scheme AS). For example, the aminoester is heated in xylene at reflux temperature in the presence of a catalytic amount of sodium isopropoxide. The doubly protected azepin derivative A16.8 is then selectively deprotected to give the phenol A16.9. The procedure for the selective deprotectiton is dependent on the nature of the protecting groups. For example, if the phenol A16.1 is protected as the benzhydryl derivative, the phenol A16.4 is protected as, for example, the TIPS derivative. Deprotection of the azepin A16.8 is then effected by treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran. The phenol A16.9 is then reacted with a dialkyl hydroxy-substituted phosphorate A16.10, in which the group R is an alkylene or alkenyl chain, optionally incorporating an aryl or heteroaryl group. The reaction is performed under the conditions of the Mitsonobu reaction, as described in Scheme A6. The resultant ether is then deprotected to afford the phenol A16.ll.<br>
For example, 8-benzhydryloxy-7-methyl-quinolin-5-ol A16.12 prepared as described above from the corresponding carboxyester is converted, via allylation, rearrangement and hydroboration/oxidation, as described above, into 3-(8-benzhydryloxy-7-methyl-5-trii8opiopyl^anyloxyKi\dnolm^yl)-propa[n-l-ol A16.13. The latter compound is then converted into an activated derivative which is reacted, as described above, with 3-chloro-4-fluorobenzylamine A16.14 to yield [3-(8-benzhydryloxy-7-methyl-5-triisopropylsilanyloxy-quinolin-6-yl)-propyI]-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-benzyl)-amineA16.15. Cyclization of the product, for example by reaction with trimethylaluminurn, employing the conditions described above, affords ll-benzhydryloxy-9-(3-chloro-4-fiuoro-beQzyl)-5-triisopropylsilanyloxy-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-l,9-diaza-cyclohepta[b]naphthaIen-10-one A16.16. The compound is deprotected by reaction with tetrabutylammonium fluorides, to produce ll-benzhydryloxy-9
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the phenol A16.12, different phenols A16.2, and/or different hydroxyesters A16.10, and/or different amines ArBNHJz, the corresponding products A16.11 are obtained.<br>

Scheme A17 illustrates methods for the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ice in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a one-carbon link, or by saturated or unsaturated multicarbon chains optionally incorporating a heteroatom. In this procedure, a 4-methyl-substituted quinoline A17.3 is prepared by means of a Doebner-von Miller condensation between an enone A17.2 and a substituted aniline A17.1. The preparation of quinolines by means of the Doebner-von Miller reaction is described in Heterocyclic Chemistry, by T. L. Gilchrist, Longman, 1992, p. 158. The reaction is performed by heating equimolar amounts of the reactants in an inert solvent such as dimethylacetamide. The bromohydroxyquinoline A17.3 is then transformed, by means of reaction sequence such as that illustrated in Scheme 8 into the protected tricyclic compound A17.4. Benzylic bromination of the latter compound, for example by reaction with N-bromosuccinimide or N-bromoacetamide in an inert solvent such as ethyl acetate at ca. 60Â°C, then yields the bromomethyl derivative A17.5. This compound is then reacted in an Arbuzov reaction, as described above (Scheme All), with a trialkyl phosphite to produce after deprotection the phosphonate ester A17.8.<br>
Alternatively, the bromomethyl derivative A17.5 is reacted, using the conditions described in Scheme A12, with a dialkyl hydroxy, mercapto or amino-substituted phosphonate A17.6, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to give after deprotection the ether, thioether or amino product A17.7.<br>
Alternatively, the Methyl-substituted tricyclic compound A17.4 is condensed, under basic conditions, with a dialkyl formyl-substituted phosphonate A17.9. The reaction is conducted between equimolar amounts of the reactants in a polar solvent such as dioxan or dimethylformamide, in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride or lithium tetramethyl piperidide. The procedure affords after deprotection the unsaturated phenol A17.10. Reduction of the double bond, as described above (Scheme A13) then produces the saturated analog Al7.11.<br>
For example, benzoic acid 7-cyclopent-3-enylmethyl-4-methyl-8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-9-yl ester A17.12 is reacted with N-bromosuccinhnide in refluxing ethyl acetate to afford benzoic acid 4-bromomethyl-7-cyclopent-3-enylmethyl-8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-gJquinolin-9-yl ester A17.13. This compound is heated to 120 Â°C with an excess of a triaUcyl phosphite to give after deprotection the phenolic phosphonate ester A17.14.<br>
As a further example, 4-teanoinethyl-7-(4-fluoro-ben,zyl)-9-triisopropylsilanyloxy-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoKn-5-one A17.15, prepared by brominaiion of Hie corresponding methyl compound is reacted with a dialkyl 2-mercaptoethyl phosphonate A17.16 (Zh. Obschei. Khim., 1973,43,2793) and cesium carbonate in acetonitrile, to give the tbioether product A17.17. Deprotection yields the corresponding phenol A17.18.<br>
As a further example, 7^3^hloro^-fluoro-benzyl)-9-methoxymethoxy-4-methyl-6,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-8-one A17.19 is condensed in dioxan solution with a dialkyl formylmethyl phosphonate A17.2Q (Awota) in the presence of lithium tetramethylpiperidide to form the unsaturated product A17.21. Deprotection then yields the phenol A17.22; reduction of the double bond then gives the saturated analog A17.23.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the starting materials A17.12, A17.15 and A17.19, different starting materials A17.4 or A17.5, and/or different carbinoJs, thiols or amines A17.6 or aldehydes A17.9, the corresponding products A17.7, A17.8, A17.10 and A17.ll are obtained.

Schemes A18 and A19 illustrate the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure ttaa. Scheme A18 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Haa in which he phosphonate group is attached by means of an alkoxy, aUcylthio or alkylamino group. In his procedure, an allcoxyethene triester A18.1 (JP 61289089) and a 3-aminopyridrne A18.2 ire reacted together, as described in JP 61289089 and GB 1509695, to produce the &gt;yridylamino triester A18.3. The reaction is performed using equimolar amounts of the eactants at a temperature of about 150Â°C. The product is then cyclized to afford the 1,5-laphthyridine derivative A18.4. The reaction is performed in a high-boiling solvent such as liphenyl ether at a temperature of about 250Â°C. The diester is then converted to the nhydride, and the latter compound is transformed by reaction with the amine ArBNHj, and<br>
protection of the phenolic hydroxyl group, into the cyclic imide A18.5. This material is then reduced, as described in Example 20, for example by the use of sodium borohydride, to afford the hydroxylactam A18.6. The latter compound is then reacted, in the presence of an acid catalyst, as described in Scheme A4, with a dialkyl hydroxy, mercapto or amino-substituted phosphonate A18.7, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to yield after deprotecu'on of the phenolic hydroxy group, the ether, thioether or amino product A18.8.<br>
For example, the triester A18.1 is reacted with 3-aminopyridme A18.9 to afford the pyridylamino triester A18.10. The product is heated in diphenyl ether at 250Â°C to form the 1,5-naphthyridine A18.ll. The latter compound is then transformed, as described above, into7-(4-fluoro-benzyl)^-hydroxy-9-triisopropylsilanyloxy-6,7-^^ydro-pyn:olo[3,^ b][l,5Jnaphthyridin-8-one A18.12. The hydroxylactam is then reacted in dichloromethane solution with a dialkyl 4-hydroxybutyl phosphonate A18.13 (J. Med. Chem., 1996,39,949) and trifluoroacetic acid, by a similar reaction as Example 23, to generate the phosphonate product A18.14.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the pyridine A18.9, different pyridines A18.2, and/or different phosphonates A18.7, the corresponding products A18.8 are obtained.<br>
Scheme A19 depicts the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Ilaa in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of variable carbon linkage, and the nucleus is a 1,3,5,9-tetraazaanthracene. In this procedure, the 1,5-naphthyridine A18.4 is converted into the phenol-protected analog A19.1. The product is then subjected to a selective partial hydrolysis, for example by reaction with one molar equivalent of a base such as lithium hydroxide in an aqueous organic solvent mixture, to produce the carboxy ester A19.2. The product is then subjected to a Curtius rearrangement, as described in Scheme A3, to afford the amine A19.3. The product is then reductively aminated, as described in Scheme A3, by reaction with a dialkyl formyl-substituted phosphonate A19.4, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to give the amine A19.5. The ester group is then transformed, as described previously (Scheme A3), into the amide A19.6, by reaction with the amine ArBNHa. The product is then cyclized to afford, after deprotection of the phenolic hydroxyl, the tricyclic product, A19.7, in which A is, for example, CO or CHfe, by reaction respectively with phosgene or an equivalent thereof, or with diiodomethane or a similar reagent.<br>
For example, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-[l,5]naphthyridine-3-carboxyIic acid methyl ester A19.8, prepared as described in Scheme A1S by the reaction between 3-aminopyridine and l,2,2-tris-(carbomethoxy)-l-ethoxyethene, is converted, as described above, into 2-amino-4-benzyloxy-[l,5]naphthyridme-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester A19.9. The amine is then reacted in isopropanol solution with a dialkyl 3-formylphenyl phosphonate A19.10 ( J. Med. Chem., 19S4, 27, 654) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride, to yield the amine A19.ll. The ester group of the latter compound is then transformed into the amide by reaction with 3,5-dichlorophenethylamine-trimethyl aluminum, as described previously, to afford the amide A19.12. The product is then reacted with triphosgene in pyridine solution at 80Â°C to give the cyclized product A19.13. Peprotection then yields the phenol A19.14.<br>

Scheme A20 illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure flee, in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a one-carbon or multicarbon link, or by means of a heteroatom and a variable carbon linkage. In this procedure, the triester A18.1 is reacted, as described in Scheme A18, with a 3-amino-4-methylpyridine A20.1 to give the substituted pyridine product A20.2. The latter compound is then transformed, as described previously, into the methyl-substituted tricyclic compound A20.3. This compound is then subjected to benzylic bromination, for example by reaction with N-bromosuccinimide, to form the bromomethyl product A20.4. This compound is subjected to an Arbuzov reaction with a trialkyl phosphite, as described in Scheme All, to afford after deprotection the phosphonate A20.5.<br>
Alternatively, the bromomethyl compound A20.4 is reacted with a dialkyl phosphonate A20.6 in which X is O, S, NH or N-alkyl, and R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, using the procedures described in Scheme A17, to give, after deprotection of the phenolic hydroxyl, the ether, thioether or amine products A20.7.<br>

The double bond is then reduced, as described in Scheme A17, to afford the saturated analog A20.10.<br>
For example, condensation between the triester A18.1 and 3-amino-4-methylpyridine A20.ll gives the pyridine product A20.12. The compound is then transformed, as described above, into 7-[l-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-l-methyl-ethyl]-4-methyl-9-trusopropylsilanyloxy-pyrrolop,4-bjfl^]naphthyridine-6,8-dione A20.13.

Scheme A21 illustrates methods for the preparation of phosphonates of structure niaa in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a heteroatom and a variable carbon link. Li this sequence, a carbomethoxymethyl derivative of the amine ArBNH2, A21.1 is coupled with the 1,6-naphthyridine carboxylic acid A21.2, prepared as described in WO 0230930, using the methods described previously, to prepare the amide A21.3. Bromination, for example using N-bromosuccinimide, yields the 5-bromo derivative A21.4. Protection of the phenolic hydroxyl group, followed by displacement of the bromine with a hydrazine or hydroxylamine nucleophile, as described for example in Example 69, affords the 5-imino derivative A21.5 in which X is NH.2 or OH. Lactam formation, for example by the use of potassium tert. butoxide in refluxing xylene, or by the use of trimetliylaluminum, then gives the tricyclic product A21.6, which upon protection of the X substituent gives the product A21.7. Reduction of this material, for example by treatment with sodium borohydride, for example as in Example 20, then gives the aminol A21.8.

The hydrazono compound is then converted into the N, N-dibenzyl derivative A21.16. The conversion of amines into dibenzylamines, for example by treatment with benzyl bromide in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile or aqueous ethanol, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or sodium carbonate, is described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Wiley, Second Edition 1990, p. 364. The tribenzylated compound is then reduced with a limited amount of sodium borohydride in isopropanol to afford the aminal A21.17. This compound is reacted with a dialkyl 2-mercaptoethyl phosphonate A21.18 (Zh. Obschei. Khim., 1973,43,2364), and trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, to give the thioether A21.19. Debenzylation, for example by the use of 5% palladium on carbon in me presence of ammonium formate, as described in TeL Lett, 28, 515,1987, then affords the hydrazono phenol A2L20.<br>

Schemes A22 - A24 illustrate methods for the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure Elbb.<br>
Scheme A22 illustrates methods for the preparation of phosphonates of structure Hlbb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a variable carbon linkage. In<br>
this sequence, the naphthyridine carboxylic acid A2L2 is coupled, as described previously, with the amine derivative A22.1, following a procedure similar to Example 28, to form the amide A22.2. Bromination, as described above, yields the 5-bromo derivative A22.3, which upon protection of the phenolic hydroxyl yields the compound A22.4. Displacement of the bromine, by reaction with a dialkyl amino-substituted phosphonate A22.5, in which the group R is aii acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated aikylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, affords the amine A22.6. The reaction is performed in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. Deprotection of the alcoholic hydroxyl group affords the carbinol A22.7, which upon activation and cyclization, for example as described in Scheme 11 then gives the tricyclic product A22.8, which upon deprotection affords the phenol A22.9.<br>
For example, acetic acid 5-bromo-7-[(4-fluoro-benzyl)-propyl-carbamoyl]-[l,6]naphthyridin-8-yl ester A22.10, is reacted with one molar equivalent of a dialkyl aminopropyl phosphonate A22.ll, (Acros) to yield me amine A22.12. Deprotection and activation of the alcoholic hydroxyl group, for example by conversion to the mesylate, followed by cyclization under basic conditions, and deprotection of the phenolic hydroxyl group, then affords the enol A22.13.<br>

Scheme A23 illustrates methods for the preparation of phosphonates of structure HIbb in which the phosphonate group is attached by means of a nitrogen and a variable carbon linkage. In this sequence, a tricyclic imine A23.1 (Scheme 12) is reacted with a dialkyl bromoalkyl phosphonate A23.2 to give the alkylated product A23.3. The reaction is performed in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile or dimethylsulfoxide, in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine or 2,6-lutidine.<br>
Alternatively, the imine A23.1 is converted into a hydrazone A23.5 by reaction with a dialkyl formyl-substituted phosphonate A23.4 in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated aikylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety. The hydrazone is prepared by the reaction of equimolar amounts of the reactants in a polar organic solvent such as ethanol, optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid such as acetic acid. Optionally, the hydrazone product A23.5 is reduced, for example by treatment with sodium borohydride, to give the dihydro derivative A23.6.<br>
For example, acetic acid 7K4-fluoro-benzyl)-10-hydrazono-8-oxo-6,7,8,10-tetrahydro-5H-l,7,10a-triaza-anthracen-9-yl ester A23.7 (Scheme 12) is reacted at 60Â°C in dimethylformamide solution containing potassium carbonate with one molar equivalent of a dialkyl 2-bromoethyl phosphonate A23.8 (Aldrich), to prepare the alkylated product which upon deprotection yields the enol A23.9.<br>

The conversion of pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride (A25.1, R =H) into the naphthyridine A25.2, R=H, is described in WO 0255079. Using the same procedure, 4-methylpyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride A25.1, R = Me, (J. Org. Chem., 1961,26, 808) is converted into the naphthyridine A25.2, R = Me. This compound is then transformed, as described in Scheme 12, into the imine A25.3. Protection of the hydroxyl and amino groups then furnishes the derivative A25.4.

In this procedure, a substituted succinimide A29.1 is condensed, as described in Scheme 1 and Example 2, with a heterocyclic diester A29.2 to afford after protection the tricyclic product A293. Reduction with sodium borohydride then yields the aminal A29.4, which upon acid-catalyzed reaction with a dialkyl hydroxy, mercapto or amino-substituted phosphonate A29.5, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to give after deprotection the ether, thioether or amine products A29.6.<br>
For example, l-[2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-cyclopropyl]-pyrrolidine-2,5-dione A29.7, prepared from 4-fluorophenylcyclopropylarnine (J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39,1485) and succinic anhydride, is reacted with 4,5-dicarbomethoxyisoxazole A29.8 (Chem.

Scheme A30 illustrates the preparation of phosphonate esters of structure IVaa in which the phosphonate is attached by means of a variable carbon linkage. In this procedure, dimethyl succinate A30.1 is condensed, under base catalysis, for example using the procedure described on Scheme 1 and Example 2 with a heterocyclic diester A30.2, to yield after protection of the phenolic hydroxyl groups, the diester A30.3. Partial basic hydrolysis, for example by reaction with one molar equivalent of lithium hydroxide in aqueous dimethoxyethane, then affords the monoacid A30.4. The carboxylic acid is homologated to produce the corresponding acetic acid A30.5. The transformation is effected by means of the Arndt Eistert reaction. Li this procedure, which is described in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B, by F.A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Plenum, 2001, p. 641, and in Advanced Organic Chemistry, By J. Marsh, McGraw Hill, 1968, p. 809, the carboxylic acid is converted into the acid chloride, which is reacted with diazomethane to give the corresponding diazoketone. Silver-catalyzed Wolff rearrangement of the diazoketone in an alcoholic solvent then yields the acetic acid ester, which upon hydrolyis yields the acetic acid A30.5. This material is coupled with the amine A30.6 to give the amide A30.7. Base-catalyzed thermal cyclization of the latter compound, for example by refluxing in xylene with sodium methoxide, then gives the cyclized product A30.8. The latter compound is then alkylated, as described above, (Scheme A10) with a dialkyl bromo-substituted phosphonate A30.9, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, to afford after deprotection the phosphonate A30.10.<br>
For example, condensation between dimethyl succinate and methyl 1-methylimidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate A30.ll (Eqypt. J. Chem., 1985, 28,139) yields, after protection of the phenolic hydroxyl groups, 4,7-bis-methoxymethoxy-l-methyl-lH-benzoirnidazole-5,6-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester A30.12. Partial hydrolysis then gives the monocarboxylic acid A30.13, and this compound is subjected to Arndt Eistert homologation to give the corresponding acetic acid A30.14. The carboxylic acid is coupled, in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, with cyclohexylmethylamine A30.15 to give<br>
the amide A30.16. Cyclization is effected as described above to prepare 6-cyclohexylmethyl-4,9-bis-methoxymethoxy-l-methyl-l,5,6,8-tetrahydro-l,3,6-triaza-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-7-one A30.17. The product is then reacted in dioxan solution with a dialkyl bromoethyl phosphonate A30.18 (Aldrich) and lithium hexamethyldisilazide, to give after deprotection the phosphonate A30.19.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the starting materials A30.1 and A30.ll, different starting materials A30.1 and A30.2, and/or different phosphonates A30.9, the corresponding products A30.10 are obtained. (Figure Remove)<br>

Hydrolysis of lie ester groups, followed by anhydride formation and selective protection of the phenolic hydroxyl groups, then gives the product A32.4. The anhydride is then reacted, as described with the substituted hydrazine A32.5, to yield the tricyclic product A32.6. Selective deprotection then affords the phenol A32.7, and this compound is then reacted with a dialkyl hydroxy-substituted phosphonate A32.8, in which the group R is an acyclic or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkylene, or aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl moiety, under the conditions of the Mitsonobu reaction, as described hi Scheme A6, to form after deprotection the phenol   ' ^_.

For example, condensation between dimethyl succinate and dimethyl 1,3,4-triazine-5,6-dicarboxylate A32.10 (J. Org. Chem., 23,1931,1958) affords after selective silylation, following a procedure similar to Example 12,6-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-9-hydroxy-10-triisopropylsilanyloxy-6,7-dihydro-l,2,4,6,7-pentaaza-anthracene-5,8-dione A32.ll. The product is then reacted in tetrahydrofuran with a dialkyl hydroxyethyl phosphonate A32.12, (Epsilon) diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenyl phosphine to yield after deprotection the phenolic phosphonate A32.13.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the starting material A32.10 different starting materials A32.2 and/or different phosphonates A32.8, the corresponding products A32.9 are obtained. (Figure Remove)<br>

Schemes Al - A33 described the preparations of phosphonate esters of the general structure R-link-P(O)(OR5)2, in which the groups R5 may be the same or different The R5 groups attached to a phosphonate esters laa - IVcc, or to precursors thereto, maybe changed using established chemical transformations. The interconversions reactions of<br>
are musiraiea in acneme A34. The group R in Scheme A34 represents the substructure to which the substituent link-P(O)(OR5)2 is attached, either in the compounds laa - IVcc or in precursors thereto. The R5 group may be changed, using the procedures described below, either in the precursor compounds, or in the esters laa - IVcc. The methods employed for a given phosphonate transformation depend on the nature of the substituent R5. The preparation and hydrolysis of phosphonate esters is described in Organic Phosphorus Compounds, G. M. Kosolapoff, L. Maeir, eds, Wiley, 1976, p. 9ff.<br>
The conversion of a phosphonate diester A34.1 into the corresponding phosphonate monoester A34.2 (Scheme A34, Reaction 1) can be accomplished by a number of methods. For example, the ester A34.1 iii which R5 is an aralkyl group such as benzyl, can be converted into the monoester compound A34.2 by reaction with a tertiary organic base such as diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) or quinuclidine, as described in J. Org. Chem., 1995,60, 2946. The reaction is performed in an inert hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or xylene, at about 110Â°C. The conversion of the diester A34.1 in which R5 is an aryl group such as phenyl, or an alkenyl group such as allyl, into the monoester A34.2 can be effected by treatment of the ester A34.1 with a base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide in acetonittile or lithium hydroxide in aqueous tetrahydrofuran. Phosphonate diesters A34.1 in which one of the groups R5 is aralkyl, such as benzyl, and the other is alkyl, can be converted into the monoesters A34.2 in which R5 is alkyl by hydrogenation, for example using a palladium on carbon catalyst. Phosphonate diesters in which both of the groups R5 are alkenyl, such as allyl, can be converted into the monoester A34.2 in which R5 is alkenyl, by treatment with chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium (Wilkinson's catalyst) in aqueous ethanol at reflux, optionally in the presence of diazabicyclooctane, for example by using the procedure described in J. Org. Chem., 38,3224,1973 for the cleavage of allyl carboxylates.<br>
The conversion of a phosphonate diester A34.1 or a phosphonate monoester A34.2 into the corresponding phosphonic acid A34.3 (Scheme A34, Reactions 2 and 3) can effected by reaction of the diester or the monoester with trimethylsilyl bromide, as described in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm., 739,1979. The reaction is conducted in an inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, optionally in the presence of a silylating agent such as bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, at ambient temperature. A phosphonate monoester A34.2 in which R5 is aralkyl such as benzyl, can be converted into the ;orresponding phosphonic acid A34.3 by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst, or by treatment with hydrogen chloride in an ethereal solvent such as dioxan. A phosphonate<br>
monoester A34.2 in which R5 is alkenyl such as, for example, allyl, can be converted into the phosphonic acid A34.3 by reaction with Wilkinson's catalyst in an aqueous organic solvent, for example in 15% aqueous acetonitrile, or in aqueous ethanol, for example using the procedure described in Helv. Chun. Acta., 68,618,1985. Palladium catalyzed hydrogenolysis of phosphonate esters A34.1 in which R5 is benzyl is described in J. Org. Chem., 24,434,1959. Platinum-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of phosphonate esters A34.1 in which R5is phenyl is described in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 78,2336,1956.<br>
The conversion of a phosphonate monoester A34.2 into a phosphonate diester A34.1 (Scheme A34, Reaction 4) in which the newly introduced R5 group is alkyl, aralkyl, haloalkyl such as chloroethyl, or aralkyl can be effected by a number of reactions in which the substrate A34.2 is reacted with a hydroxy compound R5OH, in the presence of a coupling agent Suitable coupling agents are those employed for the preparation of carboxylate esters, and include a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in which case the reaction is preferably conducted in a basic organic solvent such as pyridine, or (benzotriazol-l-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PYBOP, Sigma), in which case the reaction is performed in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, in the presence of a tertiary organic base such as diisopropylethylamine, or Aldrithiol-2 (Aldrich) hi which case the reaction is conducted in a basic solvent such as pyridine, in the presence of a triaryl phosphine such as triphenylphosphine. Alternatively, the conversion of the phosphonate monoester A34.2 to the diester A34.1 can be effected by the use of the Mitsonobu reaction, as described above (Scheme A6). The substrate is reacted with the hydroxy compound R5OH, in the presence of diethyl azodicarboxylate and a triarylphosphine such as triphenyl phosphine. Alternatively, the phosphonate monoester A34.2 can be transformed into the phosphonate diester A34.1, in which the introduced R5 group is alkenyl or aralkyl, by reaction of the monoester with the halide R^r, in which R5 is as alkenyl or aralkyl. The alkylation reaction is conducted in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylfonnamide or acetonitrile, in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate. Alternatively, the phosphonate monoester can be transformed into the phosphonate diester in a two step procedure. In the first step, the phosphonate monoester A34.2is transformed into the chloro analog RP(O)(OR5)C1 by reaction with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride and the like, as described in Organic Phosphorus Compounds, G. M. Kosolapoff, L. Maeir, eds, Wiley, 1976, p. 17, and the thus-obtained product RP(O)(OR5)C1 is then reacted with<br>
the hydroxy compound R5OH, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, to afford the phosphonate diester A34.1.<br>
A phosphonic acid R-link-P(O)(OH)2 can be transformed into a phosphonate monoester RP(O)(OR5)(OH) (Scheme A34, Reaction 5) by means of the methods described above of for the preparation of the phosphonate diester R-Iink-P(0)(OR5)2 A34.1, except that only one molar proportion of the component R5OH or R5Br is employed.<br>
A phosphonic acid R-link-P(O)(OH)2 A34.3 can be transformed into a phosphonate diester R-Iink-P(O)(OR5)2 A34.1 (Scheme A34, Reaction 6) by a coupling reaction with the hydroxy compound R5OH, in the presence of a coupling agent such as Aldrithiol-2 (Aldrich) and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is conducted in a basic solvent such as pyridine. Alternatively, phosphonic acids A34.3 can be transformed into phosphonic esters A34.1 in which R5 is aryl, by means of a coupling reaction employing, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in pyridine at ca 70Â°C. Alternatively, phosphonic acids A34.3 can be transformed into phosphonic esters A34.1 in which R5 is alkenyl, by means of an alkylation reaction. The phosphonic acid is reacted with the alkenyl bromide R^r in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile solution at reflux temperature, the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate, to afford the phosphonic ester A34.1.<br>

Chem., 2001, 66, 329, or in J. Med. Chem., 1995,38,1372. The resultant phosphoryl chlorides are then reacted with amines or hydroxy compounds in the presence of a base to afford the amidate or ester products.<br>
Phosphonic acids are converted into activated imidazolyl derivatives by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole, as described in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm., 1991, 312, or ' Nucleosides Nucleotides 2000,19,1885.

The activated sulfbnyloxy derivatives are then reacted with amines or hydroxy compounds to afford amidates or esters.<br>
Alternatively, the phosphonic acid and the amine or hydroxy reactant are combined in the presence of a diimide coupling agent The preparation of phosphonic amidates and esters by means of coupling reactions in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide is described, for example, in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm., 1991,312, or J. Med. Chem., 1980,23,1299 or Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm., 1987, 52,2792. The use of ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide for activation and coupling of phosphonic acids is described in Tet Lett., 2001,42, 8841, or Nucleosides Nucleotides, 2000,19,1885.<br>
A number of additional coupling reagents have been described for the preparation of amidates and esters from phosphonic acids. The agents include Aldrithiol-2, and PYBOP and BOP, as described in J. Org. Chem., 1995, 60,5214, and J. Med. Chem., 1997,40, 3842, mesitylene-2-sulfonyl-3-nitro-l,2,4-triazole (MSNT), as described in J. Med.

Phosphonic acids are converted into amidates and esters by means of the Mitsonobu reaction, in which the phosphonic acid and the amine or hydroxy reactant are combined in the presence of a triaryl phosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate. The procedure is described in Org. Lett, 2001,3,643, or J. Med. Chem., 1997,40,3842.<br>
Phosphonic esters are also obtained by the reaction between phospbonic acids and halo compounds, in the presence of a suitable base. The method is described, for example, in Anal. Chem., 1987,59,1056, or J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., 1.1993,19,2303, or J. Med. Chem., 1995,38,1372, orTetLett., 2002,43,1161.<br>
Schemes 1-5 illustrate the conversion of phosphonate esters and phosphonic acids into carboalkoxy-substituted phosphorobisamidates (Scheme 1), phosphoroamidates (Scheme 2), phosphonate monoesters (Scheme 3) and phosphonate diesters, (Scheme 4)<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates various methods for the conversion of phosphonate diesters 1.1 into phosphorobisamidates 1.5. The diester 1.1, prepared as described previously, is hydrolyzed, either to the monoester 1.2 or to the phosphonic acid 1.6. The methods employed for these transformations are described above. The monoester 1.2 is converted into the monoamidate 1.3 by reaction with an aminoester 1.9, in which the group R2 is H or alkyl, the group R4 is an alkylene moiety such as, for example, CHGH3, CHPr1, CH(CH2Ph), CH2CH(CH3) and the like, or a group present in natural or modified aminoacids, and the group R5 is alkyl. The reactants are combined in the presence of a coupling agent such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1957,79,3575, optionally in the presence of an activating agent such as hydroxybenztriazole, to yield the amidate product 1.3. The amidate-forming reaction is also effected in the presence of coupling agents such as BOP, as described in J. Org. Chem., 1995, 60, 5214, Aldrithiol, PYBOP and similar coupling agents used for the preparation of amides and esters. Alternatively, the reactants 1.2"and 1.9. are transformed into the monoamidate 13 by means of aMitsonobu reaction. The preparation of amidates by means of the Mitsonobu reaction is described in J. Med. Chem., 1995,38,2742. Equimolar amounts of the reactants are combined in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a triaryl phosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate. The thus-obtained monoamidate ester 1.3 is then transformed into amidate phosphonic acid 1.4. The conditions used for the hydrolysis reaction depend on the nature of the R1 group, as described previously. The phosphonic acid amidate 1.4 is then reacted with an aminoester 1.9, as described above, to yield the bisamidate product 1.5, in which the amino substituents are the same or different<br>
An example of this procedure is shown in Scheme 1, Example 1. In this procedure, a dibenzyl phosphonate 1.14 is reacted with diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) in toluene at reflux, as described in J. Org. Chem., 1995,60,2946, to afford the monobenzyl<br>
phosphonate 1.15. The product is then reacted with equimolar amounts of ethyl alaninate 1.16 and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide in pyridine, to yield the amidate product 1.17. The benzyl group is then removed, for example by hydrogenolysis over a palladium catalyst, to give the monoacid product 1.18. This compound is then reacted in a Mitsonobu reaction with ethyl leucinate 1.19, triphenyl phosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate, as described in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 2742, to produce the bisamidate product 1.20.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl leucinate 1.19 or ethyl alaninate 1.16, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained.<br>
Alternatively, the phosphonic acid 1.6 is converted into the bisamidate 1.5 by use of the coupling reactions described above. The reaction is performed in one step, in which case the nitrogen-related substituents present in the product 1.5 are the same, or in two steps, in which case the nitrogen-related substituents can be different.<br>
An example of the method is shown in Scheme 1, Example 2. In this procedure, a phosphonic acid 1.6 is reacted in pyridine solution with excess ethyl phenylalaninate 1.21 and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, for example as described in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Comm., 1991,1063, to give the bisamidate product 1.22.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl phenylalaninate, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained.<br>
As a further alternative, the phosphonic acid 1.6 is converted into the mono or bis-activated derivative 1.7, in which Lv is a leaving group such as chloro, imidazolyl, triisopropylbenzenesulfonyloxy etc. The conversion of phosphonic acids into chlorides 1.7 (Lv = Cl) is effected by reaction with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride and the like, as described in Organic Phosphorus Compounds, G. M. Kosolapoff, L. Maeir, eds, Wiley, 1976, p. 17. The conversion of phosphonic acids into monoimidazolides 1.7 (Lv = imidazolyl) is described in J. Med. Chem., 2002,45,1284 and in J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1991,312. Alternatively, the phosphonic acid is activated by reaction with triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride, as described in Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 2000, 10,1885. The activated product is then reacted with the aminoester 1.9, in the presence of a base, to give the bisamidate 1.5. The reaction is performed in one step, in which case me nitrogen substituents present in the product 1.5 are the same, or in two steps, via the intermediate 1.11, in which case the nitrogen substituents can be different<br>
Examples of these methods are shown in Scheme 1, Examples 3 and 5. In the procedure illustrated in Scheme 1, Example 3, a phosphonic acid 1.6 is reacted with ten<br>
molar equivalents of thionyl chloride, as described in Zh. Obschei Khim., 1958,28,1063, to give the dichloro compound 1.23. The product is then reacted at reflux temperature in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, and in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, with butyl serinate 1.24 to afford the bisamidate product 1.25.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of butyl serinate 1.24, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained.<br>
In the procedure illustrated in Scheme 1, Example 5, the phosphonic acid 1.6 is reacted, as described in J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1991,312, with carbonyl diimidazole to give the imidazolide 1.32. The product is then reacted in acetonitrile solution at ambient temperature, with one molar equivalent of ethyl alaninate 1.33 to yield the monodisplacement product 1.34. The latter compound is then reacted with carbonyl diimidazole to produce the activated intermediate 1.35, and the product is then reacted, under the same conditions, with ethyl N-methylalaninate 133a to give the bisamidate product 1.36.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl alaninate 1.33 or ethyl N-methylalaninate 133a, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained.<br>
The intermediate monoamidate 1.3 is also prepared from the monoester 1.2 by first converting the monoester into the activated derivative 1.8 in which Lv is a leaving group such as halo, imidazolyl etc, using the procedures described above. The product 1.8 is then reacted with an aminoester 1.9 in the presence of a base such as pyridine, to give an intermediate monoamidate product 1.3. The latter compound is then converted, by removal of the R1 group and coupling of the product with the aminoester 1.9, as described above, into the bisamidate 1.5.<br>
An example of this procedure, in which the phosphonic acid is activated by conversion to the chloro derivative 1.26, is shown in Scheme 1, Example 4. In this procedure, the phosphonic monobenzyl ester 1.15 is reacted, in dichloromethane, with thionyl chloride, as described in Tet. Let., 1994,35,4097, to afford the phosphoryl chloride 1.26. The product is then reacted in acetonitrile solution at ambient temperature with one molar equivalent of ethyl 3-amino-2-methylpropionate 1.27 to yield the monoamidate product 1.28. The latter compound is hydrogenated in ethylacetate over a 5% palladium on carbon catalyst to produce the monoacid product 1.29. The product is subjected to a Mitsonobu coupling procedure, with equimolar amounts of butyl alaninate 130, triphenyl<br>
phosphine, diethylazodicarboxylate and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran, to give the bisamidate product 131.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl 3-amino-2-methylpropionate 1.27 or butyl alaninate 1.30, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained.<br>
The activated phosphonic acid derivative 1.7 is also converted into the bisamidate 1.5 via the diamino compound 1.10. The conversion of activated phosphonic acid derivatives such as phosphoryl chlorides into the corresponding amino analogs 1.10, by reaction with ammonia, is described in Organic Phosphorus Compounds, G. M. Kosolapoff, L. Maeir, eds, Wiley, 1976. The diamino compound 1.10 is then reacted at elevated<br>
temperature with a haloester 1.12, in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, in<br>
i<br>
the presence of a base such as dimethylaminopyridine or potassium carbonate, to yield the bisamidate 1.5.<br>
An example of this procedure is shown in Scheme 1, Example 6. In this method, a dichlorophosphonate 1.23 is reacted with ammonia to afford the diamide 137. The reaction is performed in aqueous, aqueous alcoholic or alcoholic solution, at reflux temperature. The resulting diamino compound is then reacted with two molar equivalents of ethyl 2-bromo-3-methylbutyrate 138, in a polar organic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidinone at ca. 150Â°C, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, and optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide, to afford the bisamidate product 139.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl 2-bromo-3-methylbutyrate 138, different haloesters 1.12 the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained.<br>
The procedures shown in Scheme 1 are also applicable to the preparation of bisamidates in which the aminoester moiety incorporates different functional groups. Scheme 1, Example 7 illustrates the preparation of bisamidates derived from tyrosine. In this procedure, the monoimidazolide 132 is reacted with propyl tyrosinate 1.40, as described in Example 5, to yield the monoamidate 1.41. The product is reacted with carbonyl diimidazole to give the imidazolide 1.42, and this material is reacted with a further molar equivalent of propyl tyrosinate to produce the bisamidate product 1.43.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of propyl tyrosinate 1.40, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 1.5 are obtained. The aminoesters employed in the two stages of the above procedure can be the same or different, so that bisamidates with the same or different amino substituents are prepared.<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates methods for the preparation of phosphonate monoamidates.<br>
In one procedure, a phosphonate monoester 1.1 is converted, as described in Scheme 1, into the activated derivative 1.8. This compound is then reacted, as described above, with an aminoester 1.9, in the presence of a base, to afford the monoamidate product 2.1.<br>
The procedure is illustrated in Scheme 2, Example 1. In this method, a monophenyl phosphonate 2.7 is reacted with, for example, thionyl chloride, as described in J. Gen. Chem. USSR., 1983, 32, 367, to give the chloro product 2.8. The product is then reacted, as described in Scheme 1, with ethyl alaninate 2.9, to yield the amidate 2.10.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl alaninate 2.9, different aminoesters 1.9, the corresponding products 2.1 are obtained.<br>
Alternatively, the phosphonate monoester 1.1 is coupled, as described in Scheme 1, with an aminoester 1.9 to produce the amidate 2.1. If necessary, the R1 substituent is then altered, by initial cleavage to afford the phosphonic acid 2.2. The procedures for this transformation depend on the nature of the R1 group, and are described above. The phosphonic acid is then transformed into the ester amidate product 23, by reaction with the hydroxy compound R3OH, in which the group R3 is aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, haloalkyl etc, using the same coupling procedures (carbodiimide, Aldrithiol-2, PYBOP, Mitsonobu reaction etc) described in Scheme 1 for the coupling of amines and phosphonic acids.<br>

In the sequence shown in Example 2, a monobenzyl phosphonate 2.11 is transformed by reaction with ethyl alaninate, using one of the methods described above, into the monoamidate 2.12. The benzyl group is then removed by catalytic hydrogenation in ethylacetate solution over a 5% palladium on carbon catalyst, to afford the phosphonic acid amidate 2.13. The product is then reacted in dichloromethane solution at ambient temperature with equimolar amounts of l-(dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide and trifluoroethanol 2.14, for example as described in Tet. Lett., 2001,42, 8841, to yield the amidate ester 2.15.<br>

Alternatively, the activated phosphonate ester 1.8 is reacted with ammonia to yield the amidate 2.4. The product is then reacted, as described in Scheme 1, with a haloester 2.5, in the presence of a base, to produce the amidate product 2.6. If appropriate, the nature of the R1 group is changed, using the procedures described above, to give the product 2.3. The method is illustrated in Scheme 2, Example 4. In this sequence, the monophenyl phosphoryl chloride 2.18 is reacted, as described in Scheme 1, with ammonia, to yield the amino product 2.19. This material is then reacted in N-methylpyrrolidinone solution at 170Â°C with butyl 2-bromo-3-phenylpropionate 2.20 and potassium carbonate, to afford the amidate product 2.21.<br>
Using these procedures, but employing, in place of butyl 2-bromo-3-phenylpropionate 2.20, different haloesters 2.5, the corresponding products 2.6 are obtained.<br>
The monoamidate products 23 are also prepared from the doubly activated phosphonate derivatives 1.7. In this procedure, examples of which are described in Synlett, 1998,1,73, the intermediate 1.7 is reacted with a limited amount of the aminoester 1.9 to give the mono-displacement product 1.11. The latter compound is then reacted with the hydroxy compound R3OH in a polar organic solvent such as drmethylformamide, in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine, to yield the monoamidate ester 2.3.<br>
The method is illustrated in Scheme 2, Example 5. In this method, the phosphoryl dichloride 2.22 is reacted in dichloromethane solution with one molar equivalent of ethyl N-methyl tyrosinate 2.23 and dimethylaminopyridine, to generate the monoamidate 2.24. The product is then reacted with phenol 2.25 in dimethylformamide containing potassium carbonate, to yield the ester amidate product 2.26.<br>
Using these procedures, but employing, in place of ethyl N-methyl tyrosinate 2.23 or phenol 2.25, the aminoesters 1.9 and/or the hydroxy compounds R3OH, the corresponding products 2.3 are obtained.<br>

In one procedure, a phosphonate monoester 1.1, prepared as described above, is coupled, using one of the methods described above, with a hydroxyester 3.1, in which the groups R4 and Rs are as described in Scheme 1. For example, equimolar amounts of the reactants are coupled in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, as described in Aust. J. Chem., 1963, 609, optionally in the presence of dimethylaminopyridine, as described in Tet., 1999, 55,12997. The reaction is conducted in an inert solvent at ambient temperature.<br>

Using this procedure, but employing, in place of ethyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate 3.10, different hydroxyesters 3.1, the corresponding products 3.2 are obtained.<br>
The conversion of a phosphonate monoester 1.1 into a mixed diester 3.2 is also accomplished by means of a Mitsonobu coupling reaction with the hydroxyester 3.1, as described in Org. Lett., 2001, 643. In this method, the reactants 1.1 and 3.1 are combined in a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a triarylphosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate, to give the mixed diester 3.2. The R1 substituent is varied by cleavage, using the methods described previously, to afford the monoacid product 3.3. The product is then coupled, for example using methods described above, with the hydroxy compound R3OH, to give the diester product 3.4.<br>
The procedure is illustrated in Scheme 3, Example 2. In this method, a monoaflyl phosphonate 3.12 is coupled in tetrahydrofuran solution, in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate, with ethyl lactate 3.13 to give the mixed diester 3.14. The product is reacted with tris(triphenylphosphine) rhodium chloride (Wilkinson catalyst) in acetonitrile, as described previously, to remove the allyl group and produce the monoacid product 3.15. The latter compound is then coupled, in pyridine solution at ambient temperature, in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, with one molar equivalent of 3-hydroxypyridine 3.16 to yield the mixed diester 3.17.<br>
Using the above procedures, but employing, in place of the ethyl lactate 3.13 or 3-hydroxypyridine, a different hydroxyester 3.1 and/or a different hydroxy compound R3OH, the corresponding products 3.4 are obtained.<br>
The mixed diesters 3.2 are also obtained from the monoesters 1.1 via the intermediacy of the activated monoesters 3.5.

described in J. Med. Chem., 2002,45,1284. The resultant activated monoester is then reacted with the hydroxyester 3.1, as described above, to yield the mixed diester 3.2.<br>
The procedure is illustrated in Scheme 3, Example 3. In this sequence, a monophenyl phosphonate 3.9 is reacted, in acetonitrile solution at 70Â°C, with ten equivalents of thionyl chloride, so as to produce the phosphoryl chloride 3.19. The product is then reacted with ethyl 4-carbamoyl-2-hydroxybutyrate 3.20 in dichloromethane containing triethylamine, to give the mixed diester 3.21.<br>

In this procedure, the monoacid intermediate 33 is converted into the activated derivative 3.6 in which Lv is a leaving group such as chloro, imidazole, and the like, as previously described. The activated intermediate is then reacted witii the hydroxy compound R3OH, in the presence of a base, to yield the mixed diester product 3*4.<br>

Alternatively, the diesters 4.3 are obtained by alkylation of the phosphonic acid 1.6 with a haloester 4.1. The allcylation reaction is performed as described in Scheme 3 for the preparation of the esters 3.4.<br>
This method is illustrated in Scheme 4, Example 2. In this procedure, the phosphonic acid 1.6 is reacted with excess ethyl 3-bromo-2-methylpropionate 4.7 and diisopropylethylamine in dimethylformamide at ca. 80Â°C. as described in Anal. Chem., 1987, 59,1056, to produce the diester 4.8.<br>

For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc), preferably 0.2 to 15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.<br>
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may deskably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogs.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic<br>
emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Emulgpnts and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tweenâ„¢ 60, Spanâ„¢ 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present hi such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% particularly about 1.5% w/w.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
.   Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns (including<br>
particle sizes in a range between 20 and 500 microns in increments of 5 microns such as 30 microns, 35 microns, etc), which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as pentamidine for treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.<br>
The present invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be used to provide controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing as active ingredient one or more compounds of the invention ("controlled release formulations") in which the release of the active ingredient can be controlled and regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given invention compound. Controlled release formulations adapted for oral administration in which discrete units comprising one or more compounds of the invention can be prepared according to conventional methods. Controlled release formulations may be employed for the treatment or prophylaxis of various microbial infections particularly human bacterial, human parasitic protozoan or human viral infections caused by microbial species including Plasmodium, Pneumocystis, herpes viruses (CMV, HSV 1, HSV 2, VZV, and the like), retroviruses, adenoviruses and the like. The controlled release formulations can be used to treat HIV infections and related conditions such as tuberculosis, malaria, pneumocystis pneumonia, CMV retinitis, AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC) and progressive generalized lymphadeopalhy (PGL), and AEDS-related neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, and tropical spastic paraparesis. Other human retroviral infections that may be treated with the controlled release formulations according to the invention include Human T-cell Lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I and IV and HTV-2 infections. The invention accordingly provides pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of the above-mentioned human or veterinary conditions and microbial infections.<br>

Example 323	HTV Integrase Assay (ICso determination)<br>
IC50 is the inhibitory concentration that reduces the strand transfer activity of recombinant integrase by 50%.<br>
HIV Integrase assay was carried out in Reacti-Bind High Binding Capacity Streptavidin coated plates (Pierce # 15502) in 100 pil reactions following the method of Hazuda etal Nucleic Acids Res. (1994) 22:1121-22. The wells of the plate are rinsed once with PBS. Each well is then coated at room temperature for 1 h with 100 jtil of 0.14 fiM. double-stranded donor DNA of Hazuda etal.<br>
After coating, the plate was washed twice with PBS. 3'processing of the donor DNA is started by adding 80 [d of Integrase/buffer mixture (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3,12.5 mM DTT, 93.75 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2,1.25% Glycerol, 0.3125 fjM integrase) to each well. 3'-Processing was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 Â°C, after which, 10 /il of test compound and 10 ju.1 of 2.5 /iM digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled, double-stranded Target DNA, according to Hazuda etal, were added to each well to allow strand transfer to proceed for 30 min at 37 Â°C. The plate was then washed three times with 2X SSC for 5 min and rinsed once with PBS. For detection of integrated product, 100 /il of a 1/2000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Pierce #31468) were added to each well and incubated for 1 hour. The plate was then washed three times for 5 min each, with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. For signal development and amplification, 100 [il of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Substrate (Pierce #37075) were added to each well. Chemiluminescence (in relative light units) was read immediately at 425 nm in the SPECTRAmax GEMINI Microplate Spectrophotometer using the end point mode at 5 sec per well. For ICso determinations, eight concentrations of test compounds in a 1/2.2 dilution series were used. Certain compounds of the invention, including those in Tables 1-5, had a strand transfer ICso less than about 10<br>
