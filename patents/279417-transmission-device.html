				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TRANSMISSION DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to an<br>
LTE (Long Term Evolution) system, and more particularly<br>
to a transmission device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a communication system succeeding the W-<br>
CDMA and the HSDPA, an LTE (Long Term Evolution) system<br>
is being worked on by the 3GPP (3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project), which is the standardization group<br>
for the W-CDMA. In the LTE system, an OFDMA (Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access) system is being<br>
considered for the downlink, and an SC-FDMA (Single-<br>
Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access) system is<br>
being considered for the uplink.<br>
In the OFDMA system, a frequency bandwidth is<br>
divided into plural narrower frequency bandwidths<br>
(subcarriers), and data are transmitted by being carried<br>
on the frequency bandwidths. By contiguously arranging<br>
the subcarriers without interfering with each other<br>
though the subcarriers may be partially overlapped, it<br>
becomes possible to achieve fast transmission and<br>
improve the use efficiency of the frequency bandwidths.<br>
The SC-FDMA system is a transmission system in<br>
which a frequency bandwidth is divided so that plural<br>
terminals can transmit using a different frequency<br>
bandwidth among the plural terminals to reduce the<br>
interference between the terminals. The SC-FDMA system<br>
has the characteristics that the variation of the<br>
 <br>
transmitting power becomes small. Therefore, the<br>
configuration of the transmitter of the terminal can be<br>
relatively simplified.<br>
In addition, as the transmission methods in a<br>
downlink data channel, there are localized transmission<br>
and distributed transmission.<br>
In localized transmission, as shown in FIG. 1A,<br>
a frequency block is allocated as a unit to each user.<br>
For example, in localized transmission, the frequency<br>
blocks having good frequency selective fading are<br>
allocated. Generally, localized transmission may be<br>
effectively used when the size of the transmission data<br>
is large and the frequency scheduling effect is required<br>
to be enhanced. The frequency block may be called a<br>
resource block.<br>
In distributed transmission, as shown in FIG.<br>
IB, data are spread (distributed) across the entire<br>
available bandwidth without relation to the frequency<br>
blocks and transmitted. For example, distributed<br>
transmission is generally used when the frequency<br>
scheduling may not be performed due to fast movement and<br>
when the size of the transmission data is small such as<br>
the case of VoIP.<br>
In the LTE system, it is required for a single<br>
system to support various sizes of packets ranging from<br>
packets having a larger size used in browsing a Web site<br>
or the like to packets having a smaller size used in<br>
VoIP or the like in communications with slow users and<br>
fast moving users as well.<br>
To support both the localized transmission and<br>
distributed transmission by a single system, there has<br>
been proposed a communication device in which, when<br>
distributed transmission is performed at the resource<br>
 <br>
block level, one resource block is divided into plural<br>
divided blocks, and the divided blocks are allocated as<br>
the resource blocks.<br>
This communication device generates control<br>
information with respect to a mobile station to which<br>
the resource blocks are allocated. For example, the<br>
allocated bandwidth is divided into plural parts and<br>
identification codes such as identification numbers<br>
indicating the physical locations of the thus-divided<br>
and generated plural resource blocks are assigned to the<br>
plural resource blocks.<br>
In this case, a division number of the<br>
resource: blocks to be used for distributed transmission<br>
among the plural resource blocks is set equal to an<br>
allocation unit of the divided resource blocks to be<br>
allocated to a mobile station as a unit and is defined<br>
as "ND" (where ND is an integer number greater than 0) .<br>
Namely, the divided resource blocks are assigned by<br>
regarding the resource block as a unit. FIG. 2A shows a<br>
case where ND=2. According to FIG. 2A, in a case of ND=2,<br>
each of the resource blocks used for distributed<br>
transmission is divided into two parts (divided resource<br>
blocks), and the two divided resource blocks, namely a<br>
pair of the divided resource blocks, becomes a unit to<br>
be allocated to a mobile station. In this case, the<br>
physical locations of the resource blocks used for<br>
distributed transmission are predetermined in accordance<br>
with the total number of resource blocks used for<br>
distributed transmission.<br>
In this case, as shown in FIG. 2B, a specific<br>
signaling format for transmitting the allocation<br>
information includes each field for an ID (UE-ID) of an<br>
allocated mobile station, a transmission type indicating<br>
 <br>
which of localized transmission or distributed<br>
transmission is to be performed, and allocation<br>
information with respect to each resource block, namely,<br>
the resource block used for localized transmission and<br>
the resource block for distributed transmission. In the<br>
fields for the allocation information with respect to<br>
the resource blocks, subfields corresponding to the<br>
resource blocks are provided, and information of<br>
allocated or non-allocated is assigned to the subfields.<br>
An assigning method of the allocation information with<br>
respect to the resource blocks is called "bitmap". A<br>
base station transmits control bits including such<br>
allocation information as many numbers as the number of<br>
mobile stations allocated to perform localized<br>
transmission and distributed transmission.<br>

Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
However, the prior art described above has the<br>
following problem.<br>
The resource blocks are provided by dividing a<br>
system bandwidth, i.e., an allocated bandwidth, into<br>
plural parts. The consideration of the size of the<br>
resource block is being conducted.<br>
When the size of the resource block is 25<br>
subcarriers (375 kHz), there are many transmission data<br>
exist that don't require one resource block. Therefore,<br>
there has been a proposal in which the size of the<br>
resource block is reduced to 12 subcarriers (180 kHz).<br>
 <br>
By adopting this proposal, the size of the<br>
resource block becomes smaller and accordingly, the<br>
number of resource blocks included in the allocated<br>
system bandwidth can be increased, and the degree of<br>
freedom of allocating the resource blocks to a user may<br>
be increased. However, since the number of resource<br>
blocks is increased, the number of signaling bits is<br>
increased. More specifically, there is an increase in<br>
the number of bits necessary for the allocation<br>
information with respect to each resource block<br>
described with reference to FIG. 2B.<br>
The number of bits necessary for the signaling<br>
announcing the allocation of the resource blocks to a<br>
user is proportional to the number of the resource<br>
blocks. Because of this feature, the number of<br>
signaling bits increases in proportion to the increased<br>
number cf the resource blocks.<br>
For example, when the system bandwidth is 10<br>
MHz, the number of resource blocks is approximately 50.<br>
In this case, when a method is applied in which the<br>
allocation information is assigned with respect to each<br>
resource block using separate coding and bitmap, sixty<br>
(60) or more bits per mobile station become necessary.<br>
In a transmission device according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, both of localized<br>
transmission and distributed transmission are supported<br>
in a single system, and even when the number of resource<br>
blocks is increased, the increase of the signaling bits<br>
announcing the allocation of the resource blocks to a<br>
user can be minimized.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
According to an aspect of the present<br>
 <br>
invention, a transmission device includes<br>
a frequency scheduling unit configured to<br>
allocate resource blocks as a unit to each user,<br>
the resource blocks being blocks of consecutive<br>
frequency subcarriers divided from a system bandwidth,<br>
constitute a first group including consecutive<br>
plural resource blocks,<br>
constitute plural second groups, each including one<br>
or more resource blocks of the plural resource blocks<br>
constituting each first group, and<br>
allocate the resource blocks of either the first<br>
group or one or more the second groups;<br>
a mapping unit configured to allocate<br>
transmission data to the resource blocks in accordance<br>
with the allocation; and<br>
a control information generating unit<br>
configured to generate control information with respect<br>
to a mobile station to which either the first group or<br>
one or more the second groups are allocated.<br>
According to another aspect of the present<br>
invention, a transmission device generates distributed-<br>
type resource blocks including discretely-distributed<br>
frequency subcarriers in the system bandwidth by using<br>
the plural resource blocks of the second groups, and the<br>
distributed-type resource blocks are allocated as a unit.<br>
By having these configurations, it becomes<br>
possible to group resource blocks and generate signaling<br>
information (control information) by regarding the group<br>
as a unit.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it becomes possible to provide a transmission<br>
 <br>
device in which both of localized transmission and<br>
distributed transmission are supported as a single<br>
system, and even when the number of resource blocks is<br>
increased, the increase of the signaling bits announcing<br>
the allocation of the resource blocks to a user can be<br>
minimized.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Next, the best mode for carrying out the<br>
invention is described based on the following<br>
embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In all the figures, the same reference<br>
numerals are commonly used for the elements having the<br>
same function, and repeated descriptions of such<br>
elements are omitted.<br>
 <br>
A transmission device according to an<br>
embodiment is described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
A transmission device 100 according to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention performs distributed<br>
transmission at the localized transmission level. The<br>
transmission device 100 may be incorporated in, for<br>
example, a base station. Namely, a resource block used<br>
for the localized transmission is divided into plural<br>
parts and the thus-divided resource blocks (divided<br>
resource blocks) are allocated to a user who uses<br>
distributed transmission.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the transmission device<br>
100 includes a resource block (RB) allocation ratio<br>
switching section 102, a frequency scheduling section<br>
104, a control information generating section 106, a<br>
transmission data generating section 112, coding<br>
rate/data modulation determining sections 108 and 114,<br>
and mapping sections 110 and 116. The resource block<br>
(RB) allocation ratio switching section 102 inputs<br>
information indicating the mobility of each mobile<br>
station (UE) and information indicating traffic of the<br>
mobile stations such as size and type of transmission<br>
data. The frequency scheduling section 104 inputs<br>
propagation path information of each mobile station such<br>
as the status of the downlink propagation path, the<br>
priority information of the mobile station, and the<br>
output signal from the resource block allocation ratio<br>
switching section 102. The output signal from the<br>
frequency scheduling section 104 is input to the control<br>
information generating section 106 and the transmission<br>
data generating section 112. The output signal from the<br>
control information generating section 106 is input to<br>
the coding rate/data modulation determining section 108,<br>
 <br>
and the output signal from the transmission data<br>
generating section 112 is input to the coding rate/data<br>
modulation determining section 114. The mapping section<br>
110 inputs the output signal from the coding rate/data<br>
modulation determining section 108 and outputs control<br>
information. The mapping section 116 inputs the output<br>
signal from the coding rate/data modulation determining<br>
section 114 and data and outputs data.<br>
The resource block allocation ratio switching<br>
section 102 determines mobile stations to perform<br>
localized transmission and mobile stations to perform<br>
the distributed transmission based on the information<br>
indicating the mobility of each mobile station (UE), the<br>
information indicating traffic, and the like. The<br>
resource block allocation ratio switching section 102<br>
further determines a ratio between the resource blocks<br>
to be allocated to the mobile stations that perform<br>
localized transmission and the resource blocks to be<br>
allocated to the mobile stations that perform<br>
distributed transmission, and inputs the determined<br>
value of the ratio to the frequency scheduling section<br>
104 as resource block allocation ratio information.<br>
The resource block allocation ratio switching<br>
section 102 determines that, for example, a mobile<br>
station having high mobility and a mobile station<br>
transmitting traffic having small data size such as VoIP<br>
are the mobile stations which are to perform distributed<br>
transmission. Further, upon determining the allocation<br>
ratio of the resource blocks, the resource block<br>
allocation ratio switching section 102 increases the<br>
rate of resource blocks allocated to perform distributed<br>
transmission when, for example, there are many mobile<br>
stations having high mobility or there are many mobile<br>
 <br>
stations that transmit traffic data having a small data<br>
size such as in VoIP.<br>
The frequency scheduling section 104 allocates<br>
resource blocks to each mobile station based on the<br>
input information indicating the propagation path of the<br>
mobile stations, priority information indicating<br>
priority of the mobile stations, and the resource block<br>
allocation ratio information. Herein, the priority<br>
information refers to digitized information with respect<br>
to each mobile station by considering the items such as<br>
whether a retransmission request is included, an elapsed<br>
time after packets are transmitted from a transmission<br>
terminal, a target transmission rate, actual throughput,<br>
and an allowable delay in the packet transmission.<br>
For example, the frequency scheduling section<br>
104 adaptively switches the allocation ratio between the<br>
resource blocks which are to perform localized<br>
transmission and the resource blocks which are to<br>
perform distributed transmission at every predetermined<br>
cycle such as at every cycle of scheduling based on the<br>
status of each mobile station such as a channel status<br>
and the resource block allocation ratio information<br>
determined in accordance with the traffic. By doing<br>
this, the throughput of a data channel may be increased.<br>
Further, the frequency scheduling section 104 may<br>
switch the allocation ratio between the resource blocks<br>
which are to perform localized transmission and the<br>
resource blocks which are to perform distributed<br>
transmission at a longer period based on the status of<br>
each mobile station such as the resource block<br>
allocation ratio information determined in accordance<br>
with the traffic. By doing this, the control may be<br>
performed more easily compared with the case where the<br>
 <br>
switching is performed at every cycle of scheduling.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the frequency<br>
scheduling section 104 allocates the data to be<br>
transmitted in localized transmission and the data to be<br>
transmitted in distributed transmission by using the<br>
resource block as an allocation unit. Namely, the<br>
frequency scheduling section 104 allocates distributed-<br>
type resource blocks having discretely-distributed<br>
frequency subcarriers in a system bandwidth to each user<br>
by using the resource blocks that are blocks of<br>
consecutive frequency subcarriers divided from the<br>
system bandwidth as an allocation unit. By doing this,<br>
it becomes possible to eliminate the use of signaling<br>
information that is necessary when distributed<br>
transmission is to be performed.<br>
Further, when distributed transmission is to<br>
be performed at the resource block level, the frequency<br>
scheduling section 104 divides one resource block into<br>
plural parts, for example, "N" divided parts (where N is<br>
an integer number greater than 0). Namely, the<br>
frequency scheduling section 104 allocates the<br>
distributed-type resource blocks as the resource block<br>
with respect to a user who uses distributed transmission.<br>
Herein, the resource block may also be regarded as a<br>
unit for mapping users or, for example, a unit for<br>
allocating a certain user.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 5A, the<br>
frequency scheduling section 104 divides one resource<br>
block into plural parts such as two parts in the time<br>
direction and allocates the resource block with respect<br>
to users who use distributed transmission to the mobile<br>
stations that perform distributed transmission such as<br>
two users. As shown in FIG. 5A, the frequency<br>
 <br>
scheduling section 104 allocates first blocks and second<br>
blocks to different users.<br>
Further, for example, as shown in FIG. 5B, the<br>
frequency scheduling section 104 may divide one resource<br>
block into plural parts such as two parts in the<br>
frequency direction and allocate the resource blocks<br>
with respect to users who use distributed transmission<br>
to the mobile stations that perform distributed<br>
transmission such as two users. For example, as shown<br>
in FIG. 5B, the frequency scheduling section 104<br>
allocates first blocks and second blocks to different<br>
users.<br>
In FIGS. 5A and 5B, the first two symbols<br>
represent pilot and signaling bits, i.e., a pilot<br>
channel and an L1/L2 control channel.<br>
In distributed transmission at the resource<br>
block level, a frequency diversity effect cannot be<br>
obtained unless plural resource blocks, namely plural<br>
distributed-type resource blocks, with respect to a user<br>
who uses distributed transmission are allocated.<br>
Because of this feature, in such a case of traffic data<br>
whose size is small such as VoIP, all data may be<br>
included into one resource block and the frequency<br>
diversity effect cannot be obtained. In a case of VoIP,<br>
the data size of one packet is, for example, 180 bits.<br>
As described above, by dividing a resource<br>
block into N parts, it becomes possible to allocate the<br>
packet data that can otherwise be included in a single<br>
resource block to N distributed-type resource blocks,<br>
thereby increasing the frequency diversity effect.<br>
The control information generating section 106<br>
generates control information with respect to the mobile<br>
stations to which the resource blocks are allocated by<br>
 <br>
the frequency scheduling section 104.<br>
The coding rate/data modulation determining<br>
section 108 determines a coding rate and a data<br>
modulation value that are used when the control<br>
information is transmitted.<br>
The mapping section 110 performs the data<br>
modulation and coding that are determined by the coding<br>
rate/data modulation determining section 108 and<br>
performs mapping on a physical channel. As a result,<br>
the control information is transmitted.<br>
The transmission data generating section 112<br>
generates transmission data in accordance with the<br>
number of resource blocks allocated to each mobile<br>
station. For example, the transmission data generating<br>
section 112 determines the amount of transmission data.<br>
The coding rate/data modulation determining<br>
section 114 determines a coding rate and a data<br>
modulation value with respect to the data of each mobile<br>
station allocated by the frequency scheduling section<br>
104 and the control information.<br>
The mapping section 116 performs the data<br>
modulation, coding, and mapping on a physical channel.<br>
Next, a specific example of the operations of<br>
the above-mentioned frequency scheduling section 104 is<br>
described in detail.<br>
As described above, when the system bandwidth<br>
is divided into plural parts, each of the divided<br>
bandwidths is called a resource block. In this<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the number of<br>
resource blocks obtained by dividing an allocated<br>
bandwidth is defined as "NPRB" (where NPRB is an integer<br>
number greater than 1). The identification codes such<br>
as identification numbers are allocated to the resource<br>
 <br>
blocks to identify the resource blocks. In this<br>
embodiment of the present invention, for example, a case<br>
is described where the allocated bandwidth is divided<br>
into 48 parts (NPRB=48) and in the 48 resource blocks,<br>
consecutive three (3) resource blocks are grouped (first<br>
group) and the same identification number is allocated<br>
to those grouped resource blocks. However, this<br>
embodiment of the present invention may be applied to<br>
cases where the division number is lower than 48 and<br>
greater than 48. Further, the above number of resource<br>
blocks belonging to the first group is merely an example,<br>
and the embodiment of the present invention may be<br>
applied to cases where the number is less than 3 and the<br>
number is greater than 3.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 6, when one<br>
resource block includes 12 subcarriers (180 kHz), the<br>
first group has 36 subcarriers (540 kHz).<br>
Further, there are provided other groups as<br>
plural second groups each including one or more resource<br>
blocks from each first group. For example, from among<br>
three consecutive resource blocks in each first group,<br>
resource blocks located at the same location in the<br>
first groups are grouped, so that second, third, and<br>
fourth groups are provided.<br>
The resource blocks are allocated to users who<br>
use localized transmission by regarding each of the<br>
first, the second, the third, and the fourth groups as a<br>
unit.<br>
In this case, a base station having a<br>
transmitter performs downlink frequency scheduling. A<br>
mobile station announces the channel status used for the<br>
frequency scheduling to the base station. Then, the<br>
channel status is announced by using the first group as<br>
 <br>
a unit. The total bandwidth of the resource blocks<br>
constituting the first group is substantially equal to<br>
the bandwidth used as a measurement unit for receiving<br>
channel status. Namely, the mobile station averages the<br>
channel status of the resource channels included in the<br>
first group (three resource blocks in this embodiment)<br>
and announces the averaged result as the channel status<br>
of the first group. By doing this, the frequency<br>
scheduling may be applied to the allocation of resource<br>
blocks of the second through the fourth groups as well<br>
while neither measuring at a higher resolution than is<br>
necessary nor performing feedback is necessary. Namely,<br>
it is not necessary to measure data of the receiving<br>
channel in each group nor to perform feedback.<br>
To a user who transmits data having small data<br>
size, the allocation is performed by using the second<br>
through the fourth groups as a unit. When the<br>
allocation is performed by using the second though the<br>
fourth groups as a unit, the channel status announced<br>
from the mobile station has the same value; therefore,<br>
the allocation is performed based on another condition.<br>
On the other hand, for a user who transmits data having<br>
large data size, the allocation is performed by using<br>
the first group as a unit.<br>
To a user who uses distributed transmission,<br>
in accordance with the division number of the resource<br>
blocks, the distributed-type resource blocks are<br>
allocated using the resource blocks as a unit. Namely,<br>
by using the above-mentioned plural resource blocks of<br>
the other groups as the second groups, the distributed-<br>
type resource blocks including discretely-distributed<br>
frequency subcarriers in the system bandwidth are<br>
generated. In this case, from among three consecutive<br>
 <br>
resource blocks in the first group, the same number of<br>
the distributed-type resource blocks as the division<br>
number located at the same locations in the first group<br>
are called fifth through seventh groups. For example,<br>
when the division number is 2, as shown in FIG. 7, two<br>
(2) distributed-type resource blocks are in each of the<br>
fifth through the seventh groups.<br>
Next, the allocation of the resource blocks to<br>
a mobile station that performs the above-mentioned<br>
localized transmission and the allocation of the<br>
resource blocks to a mobile station that performs<br>
distributed transmission are described.<br>
The RB allocation ratio switching section 102<br>
determines a necessary number of resource blocks to be<br>
used for distributed transmission based on the rate of<br>
the mobile stations that perform distributed<br>
transmission and traffic amount. Here, the rate of the<br>
mobile stations that perform distributed transmission<br>
refers to, for example, a ratio of the data size of the<br>
mobile station that performs localized transmission to<br>
the data size of the mobile station that performs<br>
distributed transmission. FIG. 8 shows a case where six<br>
(6) resource blocks that are to perform distributed<br>
transmission are generated. Namely, the number of<br>
distributed-type resource blocks that are to perform<br>
distributed transmission is six (6) because the<br>
allocation is performed by using the resource block as a<br>
unit.<br>
Next, the frequency scheduling section 104<br>
allocates resource blocks used for localized<br>
transmission to the mobile station. In this case, the<br>
resource blocks other than the resource blocks that have<br>
been determined to be the resource blocks used for<br>
 <br>
distributed transmission are allocated.<br>
As described above, the mobile station<br>
announces the channel status by using the first group as<br>
a unit. The frequency scheduling section 104 allocates<br>
the resource blocks to each mobile station that performs<br>
localized transmission as described below.<br>
FIG. 9 shows an example where the resource<br>
blocks are allocated to the mobile stations that perform<br>
localized transmission.<br>
The frequency scheduling section 104 allocates<br>
the resource blocks to the mobile stations that perform<br>
localized transmission based on the channel status such<br>
as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) announced from each<br>
mobile station.<br>
The frequency scheduling section 104<br>
classifies the mobile stations that perform localized<br>
transmission into the mobile stations that transmit<br>
larger size data and the mobile stations that transmit<br>
smaller size data. For example, the frequency<br>
scheduling section 104 sets a threshold value of the<br>
data size and classifies the mobile stations based on<br>
the threshold value.<br>
Next, by using the channel status announced<br>
from the mobile stations, the average of the channel<br>
status announced from the mobile stations that transmit<br>
smaller size data is obtained with respect to each first<br>
group. Here, the number of mobile stations is<br>
predetermined, the number being used for obtaining the<br>
average of the channel status. For example, the number<br>
is the same as the number of resource blocks grouped as<br>
the first group.<br>
Next, in the first group, when the channel<br>
status of the mobile station that transmits larger size<br>
 <br>
data is greater than the average of the channel status<br>
of the mobile stations that transmit smaller size data,<br>
the first group is allocated to the mobile station that<br>
transmits larger size data. Here, the mobile station<br>
that transmits larger size data refers to the mobile<br>
station having the best channel status among the mobile<br>
stations that request the transmission of larger size<br>
data. On the other hand, the mobile stations that<br>
transmit smaller size data refer to the above-mentioned<br>
predetermined number of mobile stations that request the<br>
transmission of smaller size data.<br>
Further, when the channel status of the mobile<br>
station that transmits larger size data is less than the<br>
average of the channel status of the mobile stations<br>
that transmit smaller size data, the first group is<br>
divided into plural resource blocks and the divided<br>
resource blocks are allocated to the mobile stations<br>
that transmit smaller size data. For example, when the<br>
number of the mobile stations used for obtaining the<br>
average of channel status is the same as the number of<br>
resource blocks to be grouped as the first group, each<br>
of the resource blocks is allocated to one of the mobile<br>
stations. In this embodiment of the present invention,<br>
if the number of the mobile stations to be averaged is<br>
three (3), those mobile stations can be allocated to<br>
three (3) resource blocks constituting the first group.<br>
For example, the resource block having 540 kHz bandwidth<br>
is divided into three (3) resource blocks having 180 kHz<br>
bandwidth and the divided resource blocks are allocated<br>
to the mobile stations that transmit smaller size data.<br>
Next, the control information generated by<br>
control information generating section 106 is described<br>
with reference to FIG. 10A.<br>
 <br>
As shown in FIG. 10A, the control information<br>
with respect to the mobile stations includes each field<br>
for an ID (UE-ID) of an allocated mobile station, a<br>
transmission type indicating which of localized<br>
transmission or distributed transmission is to be<br>
performed, and allocation information with respect to<br>
the groups of resource blocks. For the allocation<br>
information with respect to the groups of the resource<br>
blocks, sixteen (16) sub-fields corresponding to the<br>
number of the first, the second, the third, and the<br>
fourth groups are provided in this example..<br>
For example, in a case where zero (0)<br>
indicating localized transmission is assigned as the<br>
transmission type and the information indicating the<br>
first, the second, the third, or the fourth group is<br>
assigned as the group information of the resource blocks,<br>
each sub-field of the allocation information in a group<br>
of resource blocks indicates the corresponding first,<br>
second, third, or fourth group, and the information<br>
indicating whether allocated or non-allocated in each of<br>
the first, the second, the third, or the fourth group is<br>
assigned; for example, one (1) is assigned when<br>
allocated and zero (0) is assigned when not allocated.<br>
Further, for example, in a case where one (1)<br>
indicating distributed transmission is assigned as the<br>
transmission type and the information indicating the<br>
fifth, sixth, or seventh group is assigned as the group<br>
information of the resource blocks, each sub-field of<br>
the allocation information in groups of the resource<br>
blocks indicates the location where the fifth, sixth,<br>
and seventh group, respectively, is allocated, and the<br>
information indicating whether allocated or non-<br>
allocated in the fifth, the sixth, or the seventh group<br>
 <br>
is assigned; for example, one (1) is assigned when<br>
allocated and zero (0) is assigned when not allocated.<br>
Next, the control information generated by the<br>
control information generating section 106 is described<br>
with reference to FIG. 10B. Here, the control<br>
information is described when plural groups are<br>
allocated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10B, the control information<br>
with respect to the mobile stations includes each field<br>
for an ID (UE-ID) of an allocated mobile station, a<br>
transmission type indicating which of localized<br>
transmission or distributed transmission is to be<br>
performed, the allocation information of the resource<br>
blocks in a prescribed group, the information indicating<br>
the group of the resource blocks, and the allocation<br>
information in the group assigned in the information<br>
indicating the group of the resource blocks. For the<br>
allocation information of the resource blocks in the<br>
prescribed group and the allocation information in the<br>
group assigned in the information indicating the group<br>
of the resource blocks, sixteen (16) sub-fields<br>
corresponding to the number of the first, the second,<br>
the third, and the fourth groups are provided.<br>
For example, in a case where zero (0)<br>
indicating localized transmission is assigned as the<br>
transmission type and the information indicating the<br>
first, the second, the third, or the fourth group is<br>
assigned as the group information of the resource blocks,<br>
each sub-field of the allocation information in the<br>
group assigned in the information indicating the group<br>
of the resource blocks indicates the first, the second,<br>
the third, or the fourth group, and the information<br>
indicating whether allocated or non-allocated in the<br>
 <br>
first, the second, the third, or the fourth group is<br>
assigned; for example, one (1) is assigned when<br>
allocated and zero (0) is assigned when not allocated.<br>
Further, to each sub-field of the allocation information<br>
of the resource blocks in a prescribed group, the<br>
information indicating whether allocated or non-<br>
allocated in a group other than the group assigned by,<br>
for example, the group information of resource blocks is<br>
assigned; for example, one (1) is assigned when<br>
allocated and zero (0) is assigned when not allocated.<br>
Further, for example, in a case where one (1)<br>
indicating distributed transmission is assigned as the<br>
transmission type and the information indicating the<br>
second, the third, or the fourth group is assigned as<br>
the group information of the resource blocks, each sub-<br>
field of the allocation information in groups of the<br>
resource blocks indicates the allocated location of the<br>
fifth, the sixth, and the seventh group that are the<br>
groups of the distributed-type resource blocks generated<br>
from the second, the third, and the fourth groups,<br>
respectively, and the information indicating whether<br>
allocated or non-allocated in the fifth, the sixth, and<br>
the seventh groups is assigned; for example, one (1) is<br>
assigned when allocated and zero (0) is assigned when<br>
not allocated. Further, to each sub-field of the<br>
allocation information of the resource blocks in a<br>
prescribed group, the information indicating whether<br>
allocated or non-allocated in a group which is, for<br>
example, other than the group assigned by the group<br>
information of resource blocks is assigned; for example,<br>
one (1) is assigned when allocated and zero (0) is<br>
assigned when not allocated.<br>
Next, other control information generated by<br>
 <br>
the control information generating section 106 is<br>
described with reference to FIGS. 11 and 12.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the control information<br>
with respect to the mobile stations includes each field<br>
for an ID (UE-ID) of an allocated mobile station, a<br>
transmission type indicating which of localized<br>
transmission or distributed transmission is to be<br>
performed, the allocation information in the resource<br>
blocks of the first group, and the allocation<br>
information in the first group.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, to the allocation<br>
information in the resource blocks of the first group,<br>
the allocation information of the resource blocks<br>
constituting the first group is assigned. For example,<br>
in response to the allocation information in the<br>
resource blocks of the first group, the combination of<br>
the resource blocks to be allocated is predetermined.<br>
To the allocation information in the first<br>
group, the information indicating whether allocated or<br>
non-allocated is assigned by using the first group as a<br>
unit; for example, one (1) is assigned when allocated<br>
and zero (0) is assigned when not allocated.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the consecutive plural resource blocks<br>
constitute the first group; the resource blocks located<br>
at the same location of the plural resource blocks in<br>
the first group constitute the second groups; and either<br>
the first group or one or more of the second groups can<br>
be allocated. Further, by assigning the identification<br>
numbers indicating the groups of the resource blocks,<br>
the allocation with respect to each group may be<br>
assigned. Therefore, even when the number of the<br>
resource blocks is increased, it becomes possible to<br>
 <br>
minimize the increase of the signaling bits announcing<br>
the allocation of the resource blocks to a user.<br>
In the above description, the present<br>
invention is described by being divided into several<br>
embodiments. However, it should be noted that the<br>
division of the present invention into several<br>
