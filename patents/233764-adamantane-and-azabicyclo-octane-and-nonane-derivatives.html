				<td>ADAMANTANE AND AZABICYCLO-OCTANE AND NONANE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to the novel compounds of the general formula (I)<br>
possessing dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme inhibitory activity, as well as their salts,<br>
solvates and isomers, to the pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to the<br>
therapeutic application of the compounds of the general formula (I), to the process of<br>
preparation of the compounds of the general formula (I) and to the new intermediates of<br>
the general formulae (II), (IV), (V), (VII), (VIII) and (IX).<br>
The enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which is identical with the<br>
lymphocyte surface glycoprotein CD26, a polypeptide with the molecular mass of 110 k<br>
Dalton, is formed in the tissues and organs of mammals. This enzyme can be found, among<br>
others, in the liver, in the Langerhans islands, in the renal cortex, in the lungs, and in<br>
certain tissues of the prostate and small intestine. Significant DPP-IV activity can be<br>
observed furthermore in the body liquors (as for instance in the plasma, serum and urine).<br>
DPP-IV is a serine protease type enzyme, which has the unique specificity to cleave<br>
dipeptides from the N-terminals of the peptides, where the pre-terminal dipeptide is prolyl-<br>
alanine, or hydroxy-proline.<br>
DPP-IV enzyme is responsible for the decomposition of the glucagon-like peptides,<br>
peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide-2 (GLP-2) in the body. The enzyme GLP-1 strongly<br>
stimulates the insuline production of the pancrease, thus it has a direct, favourable effect on<br>
the glucose homeostasis, therefore DPP-IV inhibitors are suitable for the treatment of non-<br>
insuline dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and for the treatment or prophylaxis of<br>
other diseases connected to the DPP-IV enzyme activity, including but not limited to<br>
diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, dermatological or mucous membrane disorders,<br>
psoriasis, intestinal distress, constipation, autoimmune disorders such as<br>
encephalomyelitis, complement metiated disorders such as glomerulonephritis,<br>
lipodystrohy and tissue damage, psychosomatic, depressive and neuropsychiatric disease<br>
such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, spasm and chronic pain,<br>
HTV infection, allergies, inflammation, arthritis, transplant rejection, high 6/ood pressure,<br>
congestive heart failure, tumors and stress-induced abortions. There are a number of DPP-<br>
IV inhibitors known in the literature, but they have disadvantages as regards their activity,<br>
toxicity, physico-chemical properties, stability and duration of action.<br>
Our aim was to prepare new, effective and safe DPP-IV inhibitors having advantageous<br>
physico-chemical and biological properties.<br>

The compounds of the general formula (I) according to our invention - wherein the<br>
meanings of R, B and Z are as defined above- can be prepared by alkylation of the cyclic<br>
primary amines of the general formula (II)<br><br>
with the chloroacetyl derivatives of general formula (III)<br><br>
wherein the meaning of Z is as defined above - and, if desired, the resulting compounds<br>
are transformed into their salts or solvates (Scheme 1).<br>
In the course of the alkylation the cyclic primary amines of the general formula (II) are<br>
applied in equivalent amount or in slight excess, and the resulting hydrogen chloride is<br>
bound by various acid binding agents, preferably by a base, such as for instance<br>
triethylamine, potassium carbonate, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), or<br>
scavenger resin, polimer bound 2-tert-butylimino-2-diemylamino-1,3-dimethyl-perhydro-<br>
1,3,2-diazaphosphorine (PBEMP), polimer bound diethylamine (PS-DIEA).<br>
The reaction is generally performed at a temperature between 25 and 75 °C in acetonitrile,<br>
alcoholes, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane.<br>
The primary amines of the general formula (II) - if moiety B stands for formula (2),<br>
(3), (4) or (5) - are prepared in a two-step synthesis (Scheme 2). In the first step the starting<br>
cyclic secondary amines containing the acylamido side-chain -the compound of the general<br>
formula (IV) <br>
wherein Y stands for acetyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl group- is reacted with the compound<br>
containing the group R, forming thus the compunds of general formula (V).<br><br>
If R means aryl or hetaryl group, aryl or hetaryl halogenides, preferably aryl- or<br>
hetaryl bromides or aryl- or hetaryl chlorides are used for the arylation reaction. The<br>
arylation is performed in a polar, protic or aprotic solvent between 70 and 140 °C,<br>
generally in an alcohol (ethanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol), or in microwave oven without<br>
solvent, using excess amine or DBU as acid binder. The arylation is also performed in an<br>
aprotic or polar solvent, at a temperature between 25 and 110°C, preferably in toluene or in<br>
dimethoxyethane, using sodium alcoholates as acid binders and palladium complexes as<br>
catalysts (J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 1158).<br>
In the cases when R stands for R1aR2-CH- or R1b-CO group, the compounds of the<br>
general formula (TV) - wherein Y means an acetyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl group - are<br>
reacted with the derivatives of general formula R1aR2-CHX or Rlb-COX - wherein X<br>
means a leaving group (preferably a chloro- or bromo atom) - generally at a temperature<br>
around 0°C, using an inorganic or organic base, preferably triethylamine, as acid binder.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IV), by literature analogy, are prepared in<br>
several steps. If moiety (B) stands for the group of formula (2) or (3), the starting material<br>
is the 3-benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one (N-benzylcamphidin-8-one;<br>
J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2831). From that, the desired compound is prepared in four steps.<br>
The isomeric products obtained in the second step are separated by coloumn<br>
chromatography for the exo and endo products, which further on are reacted in the same<br>
way:<br>
(i) NH2OHxHCl; (ii) Na/n-pentanol; (iii) Boc2O; (iv) H2/Pd-C;<br>
If moiety (B) stands for the group of formula (4), the starting material is the 3-<br>
benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one (J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2831). Following the<br>
above reaction sequence, we did not succeed at any stage to separate the exo/endo<br>
products, and at the end of the synthesis the resulting product always contained the two<br>
isomers:<br>
If moiety (B) stands for the group of formula (5), the starting material is the 8-<br>
benzyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one (J.C.S. Perkin I. 1997, 1307). From that in<br>
regioselective Grignard reaction the 8-benzyl-3-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-exo-ol<br>
is formed, from which, on literature analogy, the exo-acetamido derivative can be obtained<br>
in Ritter reaction (Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 1297), which, following debenzylation<br>
results the desired compound:<br><br>
From the resulting compounds of the general formula (V), if moiety (B) stands for<br>
the group of formula (2), (3), (4) or (5) - the Y protecting group is cleaved under acidic<br>
conditions, arriving thus to the compounds of the general formula (II). Hydrolysis is<br>
preferably carried out by trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane solution at a temperature<br>
between 0 -30°C, or in aqueous hydrochloric acid solution or in ethanolic hydrogen<br>
chloride solution at a temperature between 25-78 °C.<br>
If moiety (B) stands for the group of formula (1), the compounds of the general<br>
formula (II) can be prepared from two different starting materials. One is the 3-hydroxy-1-<br>
aminoadamantane, (Pharm. Chem. J. (Engl. Trans.) 1990, 24, 35) from which after<br>
protecting the amino group a tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative is prepared, then treating the<br>
hydroxy group with mezyl chloride, the mezyloxy derivative is obtained. Utilising the<br>
excellent leaving capability of the leaving group, the compound is reacted with 2-amino-<br>
heterocycles - preferably in aprotic solvents or without solvent at 100-140°C - resulting<br>
the compounds of the general formula (IV), which following treatment with trifluoroacetic<br>
acid in dichloromethane at 0 -30°C, give the compounds of general formula (II):<br><br>
The other starting material is the 1,3-diaminoadamantane (Ber. 1941, 74, 1769),<br>
which after acylation, alkylation or by Schiff base formation and reduction gives the<br>
compounds of general formula (II):<br><br>
The chloroacetyl compounds of the general formula (III) - wherein Z stands for the<br>
group of formulae (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E) - are prepared in a four-step synthesis (Scheme<br>
3). <br>
The starting compounds are the N-containing pentacyclic carboxylic acids with the<br>
nitrogen protected with tert-butoxycarbonyl group - compounds of the general formula<br>
(VI) <br>
wherein the meaning of Z is as defined above. (2S)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)proline (Z =<br>
moiety (C)) and (4R)-3-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l,3-thia2olidine-4-carboxylic acid (Z =<br>
moiety (D)) can be purchased, (25)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4,4-difluoroproline (Z =<br>

(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l,3-oxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (Z = moiety (E)) can be prepared<br>
(Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 1169 and Tetrahedron 1994,50, 13493).<br>
In the first step a mixed anhydride is prepared with pivaloyl or ethoxycarbonyl<br>
chloride, then the carbamoyl derivatives of the general formula (VII)<br><br>
- wherein the meaning of Z is the same as defined above - are formed with aqueous<br>
ammonia. The reaction is preferably carried out in a halogenated solvent (CHCl3, CH2Cl2)<br>
at 15°C.<br>
In the second step the tert-butoxycarbonyl group is cleaved by ethanolic hydrogen<br>
chloride solution. Hydrolysis takes place at 0 - 25°C and the hydrochlorides of the<br>
carboxamides of the general formula (VIII)<br><br>
- wherein the meaning of Z is the same as defined above -. are obtained.<br>
The resulting pcntacyclic saturated carboxamides of the general formula (VIII) are<br>
in the third step acylated with chloroacetyl chloride, preferably at 0°C in a halogenated<br>
solvent (CHCl3, CH2Cl2) to obtain the chloroacetylcarboxamide derivatives of the general<br>
formula (IX) <br>
-wherein the meaning of Z is the same as defined above.<br>
In the fourth step the chloroacetylcarboxamide derivatives of the general formula<br>
(IX) - wherein the meaning of Z is as defined above - are dehydrated to yield the<br>
chloroacetylcyano derivatives of the general formula (III). Dehydratation is generally<br>
carried out with phosphoryl chloride in dichloromethane at reflux temperature, or with<br>
oxalyl chloride in the presence of DMF, at a temperature lower than 0°C.<br>
Biological investigations<br>
DPP-IV enzyme inhibitory activtics of the compounds with the general formula (I) were<br>
determined by the following method:<br>
Applied conditions of the assay:<br>
DPP-IV. source: solubilized crude extractum from CaCo/Tc-7 cells<br>
content: 0.8-lug/assay<br>
Substrate: H-Gly-Pro-AMC (Bachem)<br>
Reaction: 1 hour preincubation with samples at 37 °C ,<br>
30 min reaction time at 37 C°<br>
Stop solution: 1M Na-acetate buffer (pH=4.2)<br>
Reaction mixture: 10 µl enzyme solution<br>
10 µl test compound or assay buffer<br>
55µl assay buffer<br>
25µl substrate<br>
300µl stop solution<br>
Measurement: spectrofluorometric determination by Tecan plate reader<br>
(Ex: 360nm Em: 465nm)<br>
The reaction of the DPP-IV enzyme and the H-Gly-Pro-AMC substrate is recorded<br>
by the liberation of AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) at 37 °C in 100 mM Tris-HCl,<br>
pH=7.5 (assay buffer). Standard curve of AMC is linear up to 31.25 µM concentration,<br>
therefore we used the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) of the AMC formed. It is detected<br>
using 360 nm excitation and 465 emmission filters (integration time 30 µs, Gain 25, No. of<br>
Flashes 50) by Tecan Spectrofluor Plus plate reader. Under these conditions enzyme<br>
reaction is linear for at least 30 min, and the enzyme dependence is linear up to 2.5 µg<br>
protein (up to 700 RFU). Using 1-0.8 µg of extracted protein Km for H-Gly-Pro-AMC is<br>
50 uM. Higher than 500 µM substrate concentration caused fluorescent detection problems<br>
(inner filter effect) that can be solved by dilution of the samples.<br>
The assay is designed to detect as efficiently as possible the active inhibitors using<br>
a 60 min preincubation time at 37 °C. The assay is conducted by adding 0.8-1 µg protein<br>
extract in 10 µl enzyme sulution (using assay buffer: 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5) to the<br>
wells containing the test compounds in 10 µl volume and the 55 µl assay buffer (65µl<br>
assay buffer in the case of contrails). After the preincubation period, the reaction is started<br>
by the addition of 25 µl ImM H-Gly-Pro-AMC substrate solution (250µM final<br>
concentration). The final test volume is 100 µl and the test solution contains 1% DMSO<br>
coming from the test compounds solution. Reaction time is 30 min at 37 °C, and the<br>
reaction is stopped by adding 300 µl 1M Na-acetate buffer, pH= 4.2. The fluorescence<br>
(RFU) of AMC formed is detected using 360 nm excitation and 465 emission filters in<br>
Tecan spectrofluor Plus plate reader (30 µs integration time, Gain 25 No. of Flashes 50).<br>
Inhibition % are calculated using the RFU of control and RFU of blank.<br>
The IC50 values are characteristic for the enzyme inhibitory effect of the<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention. The compounds of the<br>
general formula (I) exhibit low IC50 values, generally below 100 nM. For example the<br>
endproduct of (2S)-1-[N-(3-pyrimidin-2-yl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl)glycyl]pyrrolidine-<br>
2-carbonitrile (Example 40) shows IC50 value of 30 nM, endproduct of (4S)-3-N-[3-<br>
(pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-1-adamantyl]glycyl}-l,3-oxazolidine-4-carbonitrile (Example 9)<br>

adamantyl}glycyl)-4,4-difluoropyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile (Example 27) shows IC50 value<br>
of 16 nM. Their duration of action and their activity are therapeutically favourable. The<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) and their solvates, isomers, salts and solvates of their<br>
salts can be formulated to orally or parenterally applicable pharmaceutical compositions by<br>
methods known per se, by mixing them with one or more pharmaceutically accepted<br>
support material or diluent and can be administered as a unitary dosage form..<br>
The appropriate unitary dosage form comprise the oral forms, such as tablets, hard or soft<br>
gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, the sublingual,<br>
buccal, intratracheal, intraocular, intranasal forms, by inhalation, the topical, transdermal,<br>
sub-cutaneous, intramuscular or intra-venous forms, the rectal forms and the implants. For<br>
the toical application, the compounds of the invention may be used as creams, gels,<br>
ointments of lotions.<br>
