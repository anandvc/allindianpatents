				<td>Field<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising an effective amount of a particulate zinc material, a surfactant with an anionic functional group, an effective amount of a pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of a pyrithione and a gel network comprising a fatty amphiphile. More particularly, the present invention relates to personal care compositions and methods for the treatment of dandruff and compositions, which provide improved anti-dandruff activity.<br>
Background<br>
Of the trace metals, zinc is the second most abundant metal in the human body, catalyzing nearly every bio-process directly or indirectly through inclusion in many different metalloenzymes. The critical role zinc plays can be discerned from the symptoms of dietary deficiency, which include dermatitis, anorexia, alopecia and impaired overall growth. Zinc appears especially important to skin health and has been used (typically in the form of zinc oxide or calamine) for over 3000 years to control a variety of skin problems. Recent data more specifically points to the healing and repairing properties of topical zinc treatment to damaged skin, often resulting in increased rates of healing. There is a growing body of biochemical support for this phenomenon. Since dandruff has been previously shown to represent significant damage to scalp skin, topical zinc treatment could aid in the repair process.<br>
Inorganic salts, such as zinc hydroxycarbonate and zinc oxide, have been employed as bacteriostatic and/or fungistatic compounds in a large variety of products including paints, coatings and antiseptics. However, zinc salts do not possess as high of a level of biocidal efficacy as might be desired for many anti-dandruff and skin care applications.<br>
Despite the options available, consumers still desire a shampoo that provides superior anti-dandruff efficacy along with improved conditioning benefit for dry hair, while not interfering with the cleansing or anti-dandruff efficacy, nor providing negative feel to the hair when it is dried. Such a combination can be difficult.<br>
Shampooing cleans the hair by removing excess soil and sebum. However, shampooing can leave the hair in a wet, tangled, and generally unmanageable state. Once the hair dries, it is often left in a dry, rough, lusterless, or frizzy condition due to removal of the hair's natural oils and other natural conditioning and moisturizing components.  The hair can further be left with<br>
increased levels of static upon drying, which can interfere with combing and result in a condition commonly referred to as "fly-away hair."<br>
A variety of approaches have been developed to alleviate these after-shampoo problems. These approaches range from post-shampoo application of hair conditioners such as leave-on and rinse-off products, to hair conditioning shampoos which attempt to both cleanse and condition the hair from a single product.<br>
In order to provide hair conditioning benefits in a cleansing shampoo base, a wide variety of conditioning actives have been proposed. However, many of these actives have the disadvantage of leaving the hair feeling soiled or coated and of interfering with the cleansing efficacy of the shampoo.<br>
Coacervate formation in a shampoo composition is known to be advantageous for providing conditioning benefits to the hair. The use of cationic polymers to form coacervate is known in the art, such as in PCT publications WO 93/08787 and WO 95/01152. However, these shampoo compositions are good for delivering wet hair conditioning but are not capable of delivering satisfactory dry hair clean/smooth feel.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a conditioning shampoo which can provide improved conditioning benefit for dry hair, while not interfering with the cleansing efficacy, nor providing negative feel to the hair when it is dried. Specifically, there is a need for a shampoo which provides superior anti-dandruff efficacy and further provides long lasting moisturized feel, clean/smooth feel, and manageability control to the hair when the hair is dried, yet not leave the hair feeling greasy, as well as to provide softness and ease of combing when the hair is wet.<br>
None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
Summary An embodiment of the present invention is directed to a composition comprising an effective amount of a particulate zinc material, an effective amount of a detersive surfactant including a surfactant with an anionic functional group, an effective amount of a pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of a pyrithione; a dispersed gel network phase comprising: i) at least about 0.05 % of one or more fatty amphiphiles, by weight of said shampoo composition; ii) at least about 0.01 % of one or more secondary surfactants, by weight of said shampoo composition; and iii) water; and at least about 20 % of an aqueous carrier, by weight of said shampoo composition.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, in accordance with the present invention, that anti-dandruff efficacy can be dramatically increased in topical compositions by the combination of an effective amount of a particulate zinc material with a surfactant with an anionic functional group and such topical compositions can further provide provides long lasting moisturized feel, clean/smooth feel, and manageability control to the hair when the hair is dried, by the use of a gel network in such topical compositions.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the particulate zinc material has a specified zinc lability within a surfactant system. Zinc lability is a measure of the chemical availability of zinc ion. Soluble zinc salts that do not complex with other species in solution have a relative zinc lability, by definition, of 100%. The use of partially soluble forms of zinc salts and/or incorporation in a matrix with potential complexants generally lowers the zinc lability substantially below the defined 100% maximum.<br>
Labile zinc is maintained by choice of an effective particulate zinc material or formation of an effective particulate zinc material in-situ by known methods.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, in accordance with the present invention, that anti-dandruff efficacy can be dramatically increased in topical compositions by the use of polyvalent metal salts of pyrithione, such as zinc pyrithione, in combination with particulate zinc materials, and further provide improved conditioning benefits by comprising a gel network. Therefore an embodiment of the present invention provides topical compositions with improved benefits to the skin and scalp (e.g., improved antidandruff efficacy and improved conditoning).<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a stable composition for particulate zinc material dispersion where the zinc source resides in a particulate form. It has been shown to be challenging to formulate aqueous systems containing a particulate zinc material, due to the particulate zinc material's unique physical and chemical properties. Particulate zinc material may have a high density (approximately 3 g/cm3), and needs to be evenly dispersed throughout the product and so it will not aggregate or settle.   Particulate zinc material also has a very-<br>
reactive surface chemistry as well as the propensity to dissolve in systems with pH values below<br>
6.5. Further, it has been surprisingly found that the particulate zinc material will remain labile,<br>
in the presence of a surfactant with an anionic functional group.<br>
A particulate zinc material with a solubility of less than 25% will have a measurable %<br>
soluble zinc value below a threshold value determined by the weight percent and molecular<br>
weight of the zinc compound.   The theoretical threshold value can be calculated by the<br>
following equation:<br>
0.25 * wt.% Zn Compound in Composition * molesof Zincin Compound* 65.39 (MWof Zn)<br>
M W of Zn Compound<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is directed to a composition comprising an effective amount of a particulate zinc material having a aqueous solubility of less than about 25% by weight at 25°C; an effective amount of a surfactant including a detersive surfactant with an anionic functional group; an effective amount of a pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of a pyrithione; a dispersed gel network phase comprising: i) at least about 0.05 % of one or more fatty amphiphiles, by weight of said shampoo composition; ii) at least about 0.01 % of one or more secondary surfactants, by weight of said shampoo composition; and iii) water; and at least about 20 % of an aqueous carrier, by weight of said shampoo composition further wherein the pH of the composition is greater than about 6.5.<br>

Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
A. Particulate Zinc Material<br>
The composition of the present invention includes an effective amount of a particulate zinc material. Preferred embodiments of the present invention include from about 0.001% to about 10% of a particulate zinc layered material; more preferably from about 0.01% to about 7%; more preferably still from about 0.1% to about 5%.<br>
Particulate zinc materials (PZM's) are zinc-containing materials which remain mostly insoluble within formulated compositions. Many benefits of PZM's require the zinc ion to be chemically available without being soluble, this is termed zinc lability. Physical properties of the particulate material have the potential to impact lability. We have discovered several factors which impact zinc lability and therefore have led to development of more effective formulas based on PZM's.<br>
Particle physical properties which have been found to be important to optimize zinc lability of PZM's are morphology of the particle, surface area, crystallinity, bulk density, surface charge, refractive index, and purity level and mixtures thereof. Control of these physical properties has been shown to increase product performance.<br>
Examples of particulate zinc materials useful in certain embodiments of the present invention include the following:<br>
Inorganic Materials: Zinc aluminate, Zinc carbonate, Zinc oxide and materials containing zinc oxide (i.e., calamine), Zinc phosphates (i.e., orthophosphate and pyrophosphate), Zinc selenide, Zinc sulfide, Zinc silicates (i.e., ortho- and meta-zinc silicates), Zinc silicofluoride, Zinc Borate, Zinc hydroxide and hydroxy sulfate, zinc-containing layered materials and combinations thereof.<br>
Further, layered structures are those with crystal growth primarily occurring in two dimensions. It is conventional to describe layer structures as not only those in which all the atoms are incorporated in well-defined layers, but also those in which there are ions or molecules between the layers, called gallery ions (A.F. Wells "Structural Inorganic Chemistry" Clarendon Press, 1975). Zinc-containing layered materials (ZLM's) may have zinc incorporated in the layers and/or as more labile components of the gallery ions.<br>
Many ZLM's occur naturally as minerals. Common examples include hydrozincite (zinc carbonate hydroxide), basic zinc carbonate, aurichalcite (zinc copper carbonate hydroxide), rosasite (copper zinc carbonate hydroxide) and many related minerals that are zinc-containing. Natural ZLM's can also occur wherein anionic layer species such as clay-type minerals (e.g.,<br>
phyllosilicates) contain ion-exchanged zinc gallery ions. All of these natural materials can also be obtained synthetically or formed in situ in a composition or during a production process.<br>
Another common class of ZLM's, which are often, but not always, synthetic, is layered doubly hydroxides, which are generally represented by the formula [M2+i.xM3+x(OH)2]x+ Am" x/mnH20 and some or all of the divalent ions (M2+) would be represented as zinc ions (Crepaldi, EL, Pava, PC, Tronto, J, Valim, JB J. Colloid Jnterfac. Sci. 2002, 248, 429-42).<br>
Yet another class of ZLM's can be prepared called hydroxy double salts (Morioka, H., Tagaya, H., Karasu, M, Kadokawa, J, Chiba, K Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 4211-6). Hydroxy double salts can be represented by the general formula [M2+1-xM2+1+x(OH)3(1-.y)]+ An-(1=3yynH2O where the two metal ion may be different; if they are the same and represented by zinc, the formula simplifies to [Zni+x(OH)2]2x+ 2x A'nfyO. This latter formula represents (where x=0.4) common materials such as zinc hydroxychloride and zinc hydroxynitrate. These are related to hydrozincite as well wherein the divalent anion is replaced by a monovalent anion. These materials can also be formed in situ in a composition or in or during a production process.<br>
These classes of ZLM's represent relatively common examples of the general category and are not intended to be limiting as to the broader scope of materials which fit this definition.<br>
Natural Zinc containing materials / Ores and Minerals: Sphalerite (zinc blende), Wurtzite, Smithsonite, Franklinite, Zincite, Willemite, Troostite, Hemimorphite and combinations thereof.<br>
Organic Salts: Zinc fatty acid salts (i.e., caproate, laurate, oleate, stearate, etc.), Zinc salts of alkyl sulfonic acids, Zinc naphthenate, Zinc tartrate, Zinc tannate, Zinc phytate, Zinc monoglycerolate, Zinc allantoinate, Zinc urate, Zinc amino acid salts (i.e., methionate, phenylalinate, tryptophanate, cysteinate, etc) and combinations thereof.<br>
Polymeric Salts: Zinc polycarboxylates (i.e., polyacrylate), Zinc polysulfate and combinations thereof.<br>
Physically Adsorbed Forms: Zinc-loaded ion exchange resins, Zinc adsorbed on particle surfaces, Composite particles in which zinc salts are incorporated, (i.e., as core/shell or aggregate morphologies) and combinations thereof.<br>
Zinc Salts: zinc oxalate, zinc tannate, zinc tartrate, zinc citrate, zinc oxide, zinc carbonate, zinc hydroxide, zinc oleate, zinc phosphate, zinc silicate, zinc stearate, zinc sulfide, zinc undecylate, and the like, and mixtures thereof; preferably zinc oxide or zinc carbonate basic.<br>
Commercially available sources of zinc oxide include Z-Cote and Z-Cote HPI (BASF), and USPI and USPII (Zinc Corporation of America).<br>
Commercially available sources of zinc carbonate include Zinc Carbonate Basic (Cater Chemicals: Bensenville, IL, USA), Zinc Carbonate (Shepherd Chemicals: Norwood, OH, USA), Zinc Carbonate (CPS Union Corp.: New York, NY, USA), Zinc Carbonate (Elementis Pigments: Durham, UK), and Zinc Carbonate AC (Bruggemann Chemical: Newtown Square, PA, USA).<br>
Basic zinc carbonate, which also may be referred to commercially as "Zinc Carbonate" or "Zinc Carbonate Basic" or "Zinc Hydroxy Carbonate", is a synthetic version consisting of materials similar to naturally occurring hydrozincite. The idealized stoichiometry is represented by Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2 but the actual stoichiometric ratios can vary slightly and other impurities may be incorporated in the crystal lattice. Particle Size of PZM<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, it is has been found that a smaller particle size is inversely proportional to relative zinc lability.    In an embodiment of the present invention, the particulate zinc material may have a particle size distribution wherein 90% of the particles are less than about 50 microns. Surface Area of PZM<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, there may be a direct relationship between<br>
surface area and relative zinc lability. Increased particle surface area generally increases zinc<br>
lability due to kinetic factors. Particulate surface area can be increased by decreasing particle<br>
size and/or altering the particle morphology to result in a porous particle or one whose overall<br>
shape deviates geometrically from sphericity.	In an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the basic zinc carbonate may have a surface area of greater than about 10 m2/gm. Zinc Binding Materials<br>
Materials which have a High affinity for zinc and have the tendency to result in the formation of insoluble complexes of zinc can foul the surface of particulate zinc materials (PZM's). By "fouling" it is meant the formation of an insoluble surface layer of the zinc binding material (ZBM) zinc salt which interferes with the kinetic lability of zinc from the base PZM material. The magnitude of negative effect of ZBM's is the product of the strength of association to zinc and the relative amount of the ZBM (relative to the PZM surface area). The PZM's can tolerate a portion of surface coverage without substantial inhibition of kinetic lability.<br>
Those materials with high potential to bind to the PZM surface are ZBM's that form only sparingly soluble salts with zinc in water. "Sparingly soluble" refers to zinc salts with lgram(g)/100g water solubility or less. These are the materials that form precipitated surface species on the PZM that interfere with zinc lability. Some non-limiting examples of zinc binding materials are laurate, citrate, valerate, oxalate, tartrate, iodate, thiocyanate, cyanide, sulfide, pyrophosphate, phosphate and mixtures thereof. A summary of the solubilities of common zinc salts and further disclosure of zinc biding material is found in US Application Serial No. 11/216,520, filed August 31, 2005 on pages 9-12 and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Many common raw materials may be sources for inadvertent ZBM's. In the case of fatty acids, for example, any material which originates from triglycerides or fatty acids will likely contain some level of fatty acid ZBM in the raw material as used.<br>
Maximization of zinc lability from PZM's requires either complete avoidance of the presence of ZBM's or limiting the amount of the material to avoid complete coverage of the surface area of the PZM (i.e., saturation). An approximation of the amount of ZBM required to completely cover a PZM can be calculated based on effective surface area of the PZM and a knowledge of how tightly the ZBM can pack on the surface. The following example is illustrative of the process of approximating how much ZBM is certain to saturate and foul the entire PZM surface. It will be calculated for the general case in which a ZBM packs on the surface in a manner analogous to a surfactant adsorbing at an oil-water interface. In this case, a common value for surface area occupied per molecule is 30A2 (equivalent to 3 x 10"7u2). It will be calculated per gram of a PZM with a measured surface area (SA, in m2/g):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Thus, 5.5 micromoles of ZBM will saturate 1g of a PZM with a surface area of 1 m2/g. Therefore, for the present invention, it is desirable that the composition comprises less than 5.5 micromoles of a zinc binding material (ZBM) per gram (g) of a particulate zinc material (PZM) / per m2/g surface area of a particulate zinc material (PZM).<br>
For an example of zinc carbonate (a PZM) with a surface area of 30 m2/g and laurate as the ZBM, the calculation then becomes:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Thus, approximately 0.03 g of laurate would saturate and foul the surface of one gram of a zinc carbonate PZM with the specified surface area. Based on this type of analysis, other "fouling levels" can be established for the specific ZBM-PZM combination. However, this example provides an approximation of the range of levels that need to be controlled to assure zinc lability of the PZM.<br>
More specifically, then, a formulation containing 1.6% of the zinc carbonate specified above would require a laurate level below 0.048% (480ppm) to remain effective. This would represent the total laurate present, whether added directly or inadvertently entering a formula via other raw material additions. This level also assumes there are no other ZBM's present; if there are, each needs to be considered separately while maintaining a combined amount below surface saturation level. B. Pyrithione or a Polyvalent metal salt of Pyrithione<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present may comprise pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione. Any form of polyvalent metal pyrithione salts may be used, including platelet and needle structures. Preferred salts for use herein include those formed from the polyvalent metals magnesium, barium, bismuth, strontium, copper, zinc, cadmium, zirconium and mixtures thereof, more preferably zinc. Even more preferred for use herein is the zinc salt of 1-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione (known as "zinc pyrithione" or "ZPT"); more preferably ZPT in platelet particle form, wherein the particles have an average size of up to about 20ujn, preferably up to about 5uin, more preferably up to about 2.5um.<br>
Pyridinethione anti-microbial and anti-dandruff agents are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,809,971; U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,733; U.S. Pat. No. 3,753,196; U.S. Pat. No. 3,761,418; U.S. Pat. No. 4,345,080; U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,683; U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,753; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,470,982.<br>
It is further contemplated that when ZPT is used as the anti-microbial particulate in the anti-microbial compositions herein, that an additional benefit of hair growth or re-growth may be stimulated or regulated, or both, or that hair loss may be reduced or inhibited, or that hair may appear thicker or fuller.<br>
Zinc pyrithione may be made by reacting l-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione (i.e., pyrithione acid) or a soluble salt thereof with a zinc salt (e.g. zinc sulfate) to form a zinc pyrithione precipitate, as illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 2,809,971.<br>
Preferred embodiments include from about 0.01% to about 5% of a pyrithione or polyvalent metal salt of a pyrithione; more preferably from about 0.1% to about 2%.<br>
In embodiments having a particulate zinc material and a pyrithione or polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione,<br>
the ratio of particulate zinc material to pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione is preferably from 5:100 to 10:1; more preferably from about 2:10 to 5:1; more preferably still from 1:2 to 3:1.<br>
C.	Topical Carrier<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the present invention is in the form of a topical composition, which includes a topical carrier.

F. Dispersed Gel Network Phase<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise a dispersed gel network<br>
phase comprising a fatty amphiphile.    The gel network phase is included in shampoo<br>
compositions of the present invention to provide conditioning benefits. As used herein, the term<br>
"gel network" refers to a lamellar or vesicular solid crystalline phase which comprises at least<br>
one fatty amphiphile as specified below, at least one secondary surfactant as specified below,<br>
and water or other suitable solvents. The lamellar or vesicular phase comprises bi-layers made<br>
up of a first layer comprising the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant and alternating<br>
with a second layer comprising the water or other suitable solvent. The term "solid crystalline",<br>
as used herein, refers to the structure of the lamellar or vesicular phase which forms at a<br>
temperature below the chain melt temperature of the layer in the gel network comprising the one<br>
or more fatty amphiphiles, the chain melt temperature being at least about 27 °C.  The chain<br>
melt temperature may be measured by differential scanning calorimetry, a method of which is<br>
described in the Examples below.<br>
Gel networks which comprise, for example, fatty alcohols have been used for years in cosmetic creams and hair conditioners. Such cosmetic creams and hair conditioners, however, typically contain very low amounts, if any, of detersive surfactant. Thus, such known products do not provide a combination of cleansing and conditioning to the hair or skin.<br>
Gel networks, generally, are further described by G.M. Eccleston, "Functions of Mixed Emulsifiers and Emulsifying Waxes in Dermatological Lotions and Creams", Colloids and Surfaces A: Physiochem. and Eng. Aspects 123-124 (1997) 169-182; and by G.M Eccleston, "The Microstructure of Semisolid Creams", Pharmacy International, Vol. 7, 63-70(1986).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the dispersed gel network phase is preformed. The term "pre-formed", as used herein, means that the mixture of the fatty amphiphile, secondary surfactant, and water or other suitable solvent is substantially a solid crystalline phase when added to the other components of the shampoo composition.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention, the gel network component of the present invention is prepared as a separate pre-mix, which, after being cooled, is subsequently incorporated with the detersive surfactant and the other components of the<br>
shampoo composition. More specifically, the gel network component of the present invention may be prepared by heating the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water to a temperature of at least about 3 deg C higher than the melting point of the highest melting-point material in the gel network phase, and mixing. This mixture is cooled to a level in the range of about 27 °C to about 35 °C by, for example, passing the mixture through a heat exchanger. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant crystallize to form a solid crystalline gel network.<br>
Alternative methods of preparing the gel network component include sonication and/or milling of the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water, while these components are heated, to reduce the particle size of the melted fatty amphiphile phase. This results in an increase in surface area of the fatty amphiphile phase, which allows the secondary surfactant and the water to swell the fatty amphiphile phase. Another suitable variation in preparing the gel network includes heating and mixing the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant first, and then adding that mixture to the water.<br>
The cooled and pre-formed gel network component subsequently is added to the other components of the shampoo composition, including the detersive surfactant component. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that incorporation of the cooled and preformed gel network component with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition allows the formation of a substantially equilibrated lamellar dispersion ("ELD") in the final shampoo composition. The ELD is a dispersed lamellar or vesicular phase resulting from the pre-formed gel network component substantially equilibrating with the detersive surfactants, water, and other optional components, such as salts, which may be present in the shampoo composition. This equilibration occurs upon incorporation of the pre-formed gel network component with the other components of the shampoo composition and is effectively complete within about 24 hours after making. Shampoo compositions in which the ELD is formed provide hair with improved wet and dry conditioning benefits. Further, the ELD does not form if the components which comprise the gel network component (i.e., the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant combined with water) are added as individual components together with the other components of the shampoo composition in one mixing step, and not as a separate cooled pre-formed gel network component.<br>
The presence of the gel network in the pre-mix and in the final shampoo composition in the form of the ELD can be confirmed by means known to one of skill in the art, such as X-ray analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry.<br>
Methods of X-ray analysis and differential scanning calorimetry are described in the Examples below.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of the fatty amphiphile to the secondary surfactant in the gel network component is greater than about 1:9, preferably greater than about 1:5 to about 100:1, more preferably greater than about 1:1 to about 50:1, and even more preferably greater than about 2:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The shampoo composition of the present invention comprise a gel network in an amount greater than about 0.1 %, preferably from about 1 % to about 60 %, and more preferably from about 5 % to about 40 %, by weight of the shampoo composition. 1.        Fatty Amphiphile<br>
The gel network component of the present invention comprises at least one fatty amphiphile. As used herein, "fatty amphiphile" refers to a compound having a hydrophobic tail group of Ri as defined below and a hydrophilic head group which does not make the compound water soluble, wherein the compound also has a net neutral charge at the pH of the shampoo composition. The term "water soluble", as used herein, means that the material is soluble in water in the present composition. In general, the material should be soluble at 25° C at a concentration of 0.1 % by weight of the water solvent, preferably at 1%, more preferably at 5%, more preferably at 15 %.<br>
The fatty amphiphile of the present invention may be characterized as a compound having a Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance ("HLB") of 6 or less. The HLB, as used herein, is the standard HLB according to Griffin, J. Soc. Cosm. Chem., vol. 5, 249 (1954).<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise fatty amphiphile as part of the pre-formed dispersed gel network phase in an amount from about 0.05 % to about 14 %, preferably from about 0.5 % to about 10 %, and more preferably from about 1 % to about 8 %, by weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
According to the present invention, suitable fatty amphiphiles, or suitable mixtures of two or more fatty amphiphiles, have a melting point of at least about 27 °C. The melting point, as used herein, may be measured by a standard melting point method as described in U.S. Pharmacopeia, USP-NF General Chapter  "Melting range or temperature". The melting point of a mixture of two or more materials is determined by mixing the two or more materials at a temperature above the respective melt points and then allowing the mixture to cool. If the resulting composite is a homogeneous solid below about 27 °C, then the mixture has a suitable melting point for use in the present invention.   A mixture of two or more fatty amphiphiles,<br>
wherein the mixture comprises at least one fatty amphiphile having an individual melting point of less than about 27 °C, still is suitable for use in the present invention provided that the composite melting point of the mixture is at least about 27 °C.<br>
According to the present invention, suitable fatty amphiphiles have a hydrophobic tail group of R1. As used herein, R1 is an alkyl, alkenyl (containing up to 3 double bonds), alkyl aromatic, or branched alkyl group of C12-C70 length.

The cationic protonated amines can be primary, secondary, or tertiary amines (preferably secondary or tertiary), depending upon the particular species and the selected pH of the composition. Any anionic counterions can be used in association with the cationic polymers so long as the polymers remain soluble in water, in the composition, or in a coacervate phase of the composition, and so long as the counterions are physically and chemically compatible with the essential components of the composition or do not otherwise unduly impair product performance, stability or aesthetics. Non limiting examples of such counterions include halides (e.g., chloride, fluoride, bromide, iodide), sulfate and methylsulfate.<br>
Non limiting examples of such polymers are described in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, 3rd edition, edited by Estrin, Crosley, and Haynes, (The Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, Inc., Washington, D.C. (1982)).<br>

Other suitable cationic polymers include cationic guar gum derivatives, such as guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, specific examples of which include the Jaguar series commercially available from Rhone-Poulenc Incorporated and the N-Hance series commercially available from Aqualon Division of Hercules, Inc.  Other suitable cationic polymers include quaternary nitrogen-containing cellulose ethers, some examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,962,418.  Other suitable cationic polymers include copolymers of etherified cellulose, guar and starch, some examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,958,581. Guar is an example of one type of galactomannan polymer, specifically having a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 monomers of mannose to 1 monomer of galactose. Another suitable cationic polymer includes galactomannan polymer derivatives with a net positive charge and having a mannose to galactose ratio of greater than 2 : 1 on a monomer to monomer basis (i.e., non-guar galactomannan polymers). The gum for use in preparing the non-guar galactomannan polymer derivatives is typically obtained as naturally occurring material such as seeds or beans<br>
from plants. Examples of various non-guar galactomannan polymers include but are not limited to tara gum (3 parts mannose /1 part galactose), locust bean or carob (4 parts mannose /1 part galactose), and cassia gum (5 parts mannose /1 part galactose).   When used, the cationic polymers herein are either soluble in the composition or are soluble in a complex coacervate phase in the composition formed by the cationic polymer and the anionic, amphoteric and/or zwitterionic detersive surfactant component described hereinbefore. Complex coacervates of the cationic polymer can also be formed with other charged materials in the composition.<br>
Techniques for analysis of formation of complex coacervates are known in the art. For example, microscopic analyses of the compositions, at any chosen stage of dilution, can be utilized to identify whether a coacervate phase has formed. Such coacervate phase will be identifiable as an additional emulsified phase in the composition. The use of dyes can aid in distinguishing the coacervate phase from other insoluble phases dispersed in the composition.<br>
A potential side reaction that may occur during the quatemization reaction of a cationic polymer production process is the formation of trimethylamine (TMA). While not intending to be limited by theory, the presence of TMA as an impurity in a cationic polymer containing composition at a pH greater than 6.8 may be found to be the source of an amine off-odor or fishy off-odor. It has surprisingly been discovered that pH has a significant effect on the level of TMA evolved into the headspace of the composition - in particular, the level of TMA in the headspace increases as the pH increases. Headspace is commonly referred to as the volume above a liquid or solid in a closed container. In turn, the level of amine off-odor can be found to be proportional to the level of TMA present in the headspace. Additionally, it has been discovered that it is possible to reverse the TMA evolution into the headspace by lowering the pH of the composition, as demonstrated and discussed in US Application Serial No. 11/216,520, filed August 31,2005 on pages 22-26 and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Therefore, in order to produce an acceptable composition having a pH of greater than 6.8, which comprises a cationic polymer, with low to no amine off-odor, it has been discovered that it may be necessary to use a cationic polymer which contains from no detectable TMA to low levels of TMA. Levels of TMA from a cationic polymer can be measured using the method as demonstrated and discussed in US Application Serial No. 11/216,520, filed August 31, 2005 on pages 22-26 and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
It has been discovered that compositions comprising cationic polymers which have levels of TMA, as measured, for example, in the method described above, below 45 ppm,<br>
preferably below 25 ppm, more preferably below 17 ppm, have no amine off-odor to low amine off-odor which has been found to be acceptable.<br>

L. Method for Assessment of Zinc Lability in Zinc-Containing Products<br>
Zinc lability is a measure of the chemical availability of zinc ion. Soluble zinc salts that do not complex with other species in solution have a relative zinc lability, by definition, of 100%. The use of partially soluble forms of zinc salts and/or incorporation in a matrix with potential complexants generally lowers the zinc lability substantially below the defined 100% maximum.<br><br>
Zinc lability is assessed by combining a diluted zinc-containing solution or dispersion with the metallochromic dye xylenol orange (XO) and measurement of the degree of color change under specified conditions. The magnitude of color formation is proportional to the level of labile zinc. The procedure developed has been optimized for aqueous surfactant formulations but may be adapted to other physical product forms as well.<br>
A spectrophotometer is used to quantify the color change at 572 nm, the wavelength of optimum color change for XO. The spectrophotometer is set to zero absorbance at 572nm utilizing a product control as close in composition to the test product except excluding the potentially labile form of zinc. The control and test products are then treated identically as follows. A 50ul product sample is dispensed into a jar and 95 ml of deaerated, distilled water are added and stirred. 5mL of a 23mg/mL xylenol orange stock solution at pH 5.0 is pipetted into the sample jar; this is considered time 0. The pH is then adjusted to 5. 50±0.01 using dilute HC1 or NaOH. After 10.0 minutes, a portion of the sample is filtered (0.45u) and the absorbance measured at 572nm. The measured absorbance is then compared to a separately measured control to determine the relative zinc lability (zero TO 100%). The 100% lability control is prepared in a matrix similar to the test products but utilizing a soluble zinc material (such as zinc sulfate) incorporated at an equivalent level on a zinc basis. The absorbance of the 100% lability control is measured as above for the test materials. The relative zinc lability is preferably greater than about 15%, more preferably greater than about 20%, and even more preferably greater than about 25%.<br>
Using this methodology, the below examples demonstrate a material (basic zinc carbonate) that has intrinsically high lability in an anionic surfactant system compared to one (ZnO) with low intrinsic lability.<br><br>

The following examples further describe and demonstrate the preferred embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The examples are given solely for the purpose of illustration, and are not to be construed as limitations of the present invention since many variations thereof are possible without departing from its scope.<br>
Process of Making a Shampoo Composition<br>
An aspect of the invention relates to a process of making a shampoo composition of the present invention. The process of making a shampoo composition comprises (a) combining a fatty amphiphile, a secondary surfactant, and water at a temperature sufficient to allow partitioning of the secondary surfactant and the water into the fatty amphiphile to form a pre-mix; (b) cooling the pre-mix below the chain melt temperature of the fatty amphiphile to form a<br>
gel network; (c) adding the gel network to one or more detersive surfactants and an aqueous carrier to form a shampoo composition, d)adding the particulate zinc material, the zinc pyrithione and other embodiments, such process suitable for providing an antimicrobial composition provided that the resulting composition provides the excellent antimicrobial benefits described herein, e) adjusting the pH of the shampoo composition to a pH greater than about 6.5.<br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment of the present invention, the gel network component is prepared as a separate pre-mix, which, after being cooled, is subsequently incorporated with the other components of the shampoo composition. More specifically, the gel network component of the present invention may be prepared by heating the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water to a temperature of at least about 3 deg C higher than the melting point of the highest melting-point material in the gel network phase, and mixing. This mixture is cooled to a level in the range of about 27 °C to about 35 °C by, for example, passing the mixture through a heat exchanger. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant crystallize to form a crystalline gel network.<br>
Alternative methods of preparing the gel network component include sonication and/or milling of the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water, while these components are heated, to reduce the particle size of the melted fatty amphiphile phase. This results in an increase in surface area of the fatty amphiphile phase, which allows the secondary surfactant and the water to swell the fatty amphiphile phase. Another suitable variation in preparing the gel network includes heating and mixing the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant first, and then adding that mixture to the water.<br>
Methods for preparing the antidandruff and other shampoo embodiments of the present invention include conventional formulation and mixing techniques. A method such as that described in US Pat. No. 5,837,661, could be employed, wherein the antimicrobial agent of the present invention would typically be added in the same step as the silicone premix is added in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,661 description.<br>
NON-LIMITING EXAMPLES<br>
The shampoo compositions illustrated in the following examples illustrate specific embodiments of the shampoo compositions of the present invention, but are not intended to be limiting thereof. Other modifications can be undertaken by the skilled artisan without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. These exemplified embodiments of the shampoo composition of the present invention provide enhanced conditioning benefits to the hair.<br>
The shampoo compositions illustrated in the following examples are prepared by conventional formulation and mixing methods, an example of which is set forth herein below. All exemplified amounts are listed as weight percents on an active basis and exclude minor materials such as diluents, preservatives, color solutions, imagery ingredients, botanicals, and so forth, unless otherwise specified. All percentages are based on weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
Preparation of the Gel Network Pre-Mix<br>
To prepare the gel network pre-mix, about 20% of the water is heated to a temperature above the melt point of the highest melting-point material in the gel network premix. In a non-limiting example, the temperature will typically fall within a range of about 65°C to about 90°C. The gel network component of the present invention may be prepared by heating the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water to a temperature of at least about 3 deg C higher than the melting point of the highest melting-point material in the gel network phase, and mixing. After incorporation, this mixture is passed through a mill and heat exchanger where it is cooled to about 35°C. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and the water form a crystalline gel network.<br>
For mixtures of different fatty amphiphiles, it may be beneficial to pre-mix the fatty amphiphile materials before incorporation into the water. This can be done by co-melting the different fatty amphiphiles together and utilizing this melt or cooling into a solid phase and incorporating this into the heated water along with the secondary surfactant. Another variation could be to co-melt the one or more fatty amphiphiles and the secondary surfactant before incorporation into the water. Some gel network compositions with chain melt temperatures between about 27°C to about 35°C will need to be cooled below 27°C to ensure the lamellar phase structure is frozen.<br>

Preparation of Final Shampoo Compositions<br>
To prepare the final shampoo composition, first, a surfactant solution pre-mix is formed. To prepare this surfactant solution pre-mix, about 6% to about 9% of sodium laureth-3 sulfate, cationic polymers, and about 0% to about 5% of water are added to a jacketed mix tank and heated to about 74°C with agitation. Ethylene glycol distearate (EGDS) and other cosurfactants (where applicable), and any additional materials that require heat for incorporation/melting, are then added to the mixing vessel and melted. After the EGDS is well dispersed (e.g., after about 10 minutes), preservative is added and mixed into the surfactant solution. This mixture is passed through a mill and heat exchanger where it is cooled to about 35°C and collected in a finishing tank. As a result of this cooling step, the EGDS crystallizes to form a waxy crystalline suspension. The mixture of these components is the surfactant solution pre-mix.<br>
Next, the surfactant solution pre-mix and the gel network pre-mix, which is prepared as described above, are mixed together. Then, basic Zinc Carbonate or other zinc-containing layered material could be added to a premix of surfactants or water with or without the aid of a dispersing agent via conventional powder incorporation and mixing techniques and then into the final mix. The pyrithione or the polyvalent metal salt of the pyrithione is added into the final mix. Product pH is adjusted, using an acid such as hydrochloric acid, to an acceptable pH. The remainder of the surfactants, other antidandruff actives, perfume, dimethicone, sodium chloride or sodium xylene sulfonate for viscosity adjustment, and the remainder of the water are added with ample agitation to ensure a homogeneous mixture.   This mixture is the final shampoo<br>
composition which comprises as dispersed phases the gel network pre-mix and the particulate zinc material.<br>
Preferred viscosities of the final shampoo composition according to the present invention range from about 5000 to about 15,000 centipoise at 27°C, as measured by a Wells-Brookfield model RVTDCP viscometer using a CP-41 cone and plate at 2/s at 3 minutes.<br>
