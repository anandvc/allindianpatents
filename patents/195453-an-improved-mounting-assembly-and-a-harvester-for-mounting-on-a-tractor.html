				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to tractor mounted harvesters, and, more <br>
    specifically to an improved mounting assembly<br>
	and a harvester for mounting on a tractor.<br>
2)	Related Art<br>
Previously available tractor mounted cotton harvesters have included those with one or more picker row units mounted forwardly of the tractor drive wheels. Other types of mounted pickers have included row units supported on the rear of a tractor modified to normally run in the reverse direction   More recently, rear mounted harvesting units have been devised for the rear of a tractor so the tractor can operate in the conventional forward manner   An example of such a unit is shown in U S Patent No 5.519.988 whch is assigned to Deere &amp; Company and shows cotton picker units mounted for harvesting cotton planted in very narrowly spaced rows. An earlier stripper type of cotton harvester mounted on the rear of a tractor is shown in Deere &amp; Company's U S Patent No 4,348,856, vanous structures have been devised for mounting and dismounting a rear tractor mounted harvester, an example of such a structure is shown in U S. Patent No 4.483,131 which is also assigned to Deere &amp; Company   Although these harvesters permit the tractor to be used for purposes other than harvesting, mounting and dismounting the harvesters are often difficult and time-consuming tasks.<br>
Another problem with previously existing rear, tractor mounted harvesters is difficulty in adapting the harvester for use on tractors of different designs   Although a mounting structure may work well for one tractor type, a different tractor type may require a redesigned or extensively modified structure and mounting procedure   Therefore, providing a simple and easy to use design that is readily adaptable to many different types of structure without extensive modifications to the structure and mounting procedure has been a continuing problem   The problem is further complicated by the need to adapt the harvester to a vanety of tractors made in different countries and with different design criteria<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved mounting structure for a tractor mounted harvester.  It is yet another object to provide such structure which overcomes most or all of the aforementioned problems<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide improved mounting structure for a tractor mounted harvester which allows the tractor to be used for purposes other than<br>
-1A-<br><br>
harvesting   It is another object to provide such a structure wherein the procedure for attachment and removal from the tractor is simplified when compared to at least most previously available structures. It is yet another object to provide such a structure wherein the attaching and removal procedure is substantially the same for a variety of tractors<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide improved mounting structure for a tractor mounted harvester, particularly a rear mounted cotton harvester, having a support post design facilitating quick attachment and removal of the harvester   It is a further object to provide such a structure including a first rear frame assembly designed specifically for and connected to the tractor, and a second frame assembly connected to the harvester and adapted for easy attachment to and removal from the first frame<br>
It is another object to provide a quick attach frame for a tractor for relatively quick attaching and removal of a rear-mounted harvester, wherein the frame is simple in construction and accommodates mounting of the harvester on a variety of different tractors<br>
It is still another object to provide improved mounting structure for a tractor mounted harvester including overhead basket structure, wherein the harvester and basket can be removed using a simple procedure   It is still another object to provide such a mounting structure which supports the basket structure and permits the tractor to be dnven out from under the machine<br>
In accordance with the above objects, mounting structure includes three groups of<br>
each  parts including, first, a pair of rear frame support members that attach one to a side   not uar<br>
directly to the tractor and are designed for the specific tractor to which the machine will be mounted   A second group of parts of a standard single design includes frame members with two rear support posts that align with the rear frame support members   A self-aligning pocket on the lower end of each of the posts and a pair of tapered bushings ngidly fixed to each post above the pocket by bolts releasibly secure the rear support posts to the rear frame support members   The rear support posts carry rear mounted harvesting units such as cotton picker row units. The third group of parts provides front machine support with a four-post design which is easily and quickly attachable to and removable from the tractor Four screw-type jack stands lift the machine from attaching points on the tractor and support the weight of machine to allow the tractor to be dnven out from under the machine dunng removal and to be backed under the machine dunng attachment   The design of the mounting structure is relatively simple, easy to use, and easily adaptable to most all types of tractors   The time required to mount the machine and to remove the machine to again<br>
2<br><br>
free up the tractor for uses other than harvesting is greatly reduced over that of most previously available tractor mounted harvesters.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description in<br>

ACCOMPANYING<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
FIG 1 is a side view of a tractor with a rear mounted harvester and with the jack stand structure in place for removal of the harvester.<br>
FIG. 2 is a rear view of the tractor and harvester of FIG 1 with row units removed to more clearly show the mounting structure<br>
FIG 3 is an enlarged isometnc view showing a portion of the rear post support arrangement for the tractor and harvester of FIG 1<br>
FIG 4 is an enlarged view of a portion of the subframe and harvester frame, partially in section, showing connector bushing and guide structure . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
Referring now to FIG 1, a tractor 10 includes a fore-and-aft extending main frame 12 supported by front wheels 16 and rear dnve wheels 18 for forward movement over a field having a crop such as cotton planted in parallel rows   A forward engine compartment 20 and an cab 22 located behind the compartment are supported on the frame 12.<br>
An upright subframe or tractor-mounted support frame 30 is fixed to the main frame 12 adjacent rear axle areas 32 (FIGS. 2 and 3)   The support frame 30 is connected by brackets 36 to the tops of the axle housings on opposite sides of the tractor centeriine and includes fore-and-aft extending, generally horizontal tower beams 38 and upwardly directed diagonal beams 40 extending rearwardly from the brackets 36   The beams 38 and 40 terminate generally at an imaginary upnght transverse plane that passes through the aft extremities of the wheels 18   A pair of upnght supports or posts 44 extend vertically between the aft ends of the beams 38 and 40. Gussets 48 and 50 connect the lower and upper ends of the posts 44 to the beams 38 and 40, respectively<br>
At the lower end of each of the posts 44, an upwardly opening saddle 52 (FIG. 3) is defined by a pair of rearward projections 54 on the gusset 48. The subframe 30 is designed to fit a specific type of tractor 10, but the aft portion of the subframe including the posts 44 and the saddles 52 is substantially identical for any tractor type to accommodate an upnght secondary or harvester frame 60 which is of a single design not dependent on the tractor type. Therefore, only one harvester frame is required, with differing tractor<br>
3<br><br>
types accommodated by simply providing a subframe 30 with beam and bracket structure that is adapted for each tractor type<br>
The harvester frame 60 supports a lift frame 66 (FIG 1). Four-bar linkage structure 68 extends between the lift frame 66 and the frame 60   Hydraulic Iift cylinders 70 extending between the lower portion of the frame 60 and the linkage structure 68 move the frame 66 vertically   Narrow row harvesting units 74 are supported on the frame 66 and are transversely adjustable on the frame for alignment with rows of cotton passing through shielded channels 78 under the tractor frame   A sheave 80 is connected to the tractor power take off (PTO) and to a drive 82 which powers the row units.<br>
The harvester frame 60 includes upright support structure or posts 86 projecting upwardly behind the cab 22   Cotton ducts 88 for each of the row units 74 are supported from the upper portions of the posts 86 by bracket assemblies 90   A fan assembly 94 ts also supported from the upper portions of the posts 86 and is powered from the drive 82 to provide air to convey cotton from the units 74 through the ducts 88 to a basket 96 located above the tractor 10   The rear portion of the basket 96 is supported from the upper ends of the posts 86   The forward portion of the basket 96 is supported at the upper ends of forward basket posts 98 connected to the front of the tractor frame 12 by brackets 100 located on opposite sides of the engine compartment 20    Rear and forward transversely extending basket support channels 106 and 108 are connected between the upper ends of the respective posts 86 and 98 to facilitate lowenng of the basket 96 into position above<br>
the tractor 10 during initial assembly of the harvester.<br>
(FIG.3)<br>
The structure 86 includes lower ends ,112             cradled in the saddles 52 of the subframe 30 to facilitate rocking of the structure between mounted and detached (FIG 4) positions using the cylinders 70 as described in detail below   A short traverse bar 114 of square cross section extends through cylinder bracket and guide plates 118 bolted to opposite sides of each tower end 112   The bar 114 is adapted for support in the saddle 52 defined by the rearward projections 54   The forward extremities of the plates 118 diverge in the forward direction to help channel the lower ends 112 into alignment with the lower end of the support frame 30 during assembly. A second set of guide plates 122 (FIG 3) are fixed to the structure 86 above the plates 118 and also diverge in the forward direction to help guide the harvester frame posts into alignment with the upper ends of the subframe posts 44 adjacent the gussets 50 as the structure 86 is rocked forwardly about the saddles 52. As best seen in FIG. 4, fore-and-aft extending bushings 126 are welded to the structure 86 and include forwardly facing tapered ends 128 which are received in<br>
4<br><br>
mating flared bores 134 located in the upper ends of the posts 44 of the tractor-mounted subframe 30. As the structure 86 is rocked forwardly about the saddles 52, the guide plates 122 direct the tapered ends 128 into the flared ends of the bores 134   Mounting bolts 136 are then positioned through the bushings 126 and the bores 134 and tightened into threaded bores 140 of a securing plates 142 positioned against aft faces of the posts 44 to secure the structure 86 against the posts 44   The bushings 126 not only help guide the structure 86 into position but also help support the harvester frame 60 and reduce shear loads on the bolts 136<br>
The four bar linkage structure 68 includes transversely spaced lower lift arms 148 connected by pivots 150 to the frame 60 just below the bushings 126    Transversely spaced stabilizing links 158 are connected by quick lock pivot pins 160 and brackets 162 to the structure 86   The aft ends of the arms 148 and links 158 are pivotaily connected to bracket structure 172 on the lift frame 66 to maintain the desired attitude of the row units 74 relative to the ground as the lift frame is raised and lowered by actuation of the cylinders 70 dunng operation of the harvester in the field<br>
Shield structures 180 (FIG 1) and 182 (FIG 2) are connected to the tractor 10 to protect rows of cotton plants as they pass under and along the side of the tractor. The aft<br>
portions of the shield structures 180 and 182 are preferably supported from the subframe<br>
brackets 36   The structures 78 define the plant channels 78   A liquid tank 196 is<br>
supported from the forward end of the frame 12 by support structure 188<br>
As best seen in FIGS 1 and 2, removable front and rear jack stand and support structures 200 and 202 are selectively attachable to the harvester and basket structure to facilitate simple attachment and removal of the harvester relative to the tractor 10   The front structures 200 include a pair of mounting assemblies 208, each slidably received within one front side portion of the support weldment for the basket 96 and pinned thereto by a bolt 210   A diagonal brace 214 extends downwardly and outwardly from each assembly 208 to a connection with a jack stand 218 with a telescoping portion for raising and lowenng the basket support weldment<br>
The rear structures 202 each include a transversely extending upper member 222 with a tubular innermost portion 226 (FIG. 3) which is slidably received within the pivot 150. A stabilizing channel 230 includes a lower end fixed to the portion 226 and an apertured upper end 232 which is pinned to the bracket 162 by the pin 160 to prevent rotation of the structure 202 relative to the frame 60. The member 222 extends outwardly<br>
5<br><br>
past the side of the rear wheel 18, to a connection at 236 with a vertical leg having a lower<br>
end connected to a rear jack stand 238.<br>
 placed To remove the harvester, pallets 244 (FIG 1) are              under the row units 74 and<br>
the cylinders 70 are retracted until the weight of the units is fully supported by the pallets The front support structures 200 are then attached to the front of the basket weldment and the pins 210 are installed. The braces 214 are installed between the assemblies 208 and the jack stands 218   The rear structure are then installed by inserting the end portions 226 within the pivots 150 and securing the upper ends 232 of the stabilizing channels 230 with the pins 160   The telescoping portions of the jack stands 218 and 238 are lowered until the stands support a portion of the weight of the harvester   The PTO shaft is disconnected from the main dnve sheave 80. The two bolts 136 are removed from each side of the support posts so the harvester frame 60 may be released from the tractor-mounted subframe 30 by rocking the frame 60 slightly rearwardly about the saddles 52 The front basket support posts 98 are disconnected from the channel 108, and the front of the basket is raised with the jack stands 218 until the channel 108 will clear the top of the tractor cab 22   The rear jack stands are then operated to raise the machine until the positioning bars 114 at the lower ends of the rear posts clear the subframe support saddles 52   After relieving any pressure in hydraulic lines connected to the cylinders 70, the hydraulic lines are disconnected from the tractor   The fluid line from the tank 186 and any winng harnesses and the like are then disconnected at the rear of the cab 22   The tractor 10 then is simply dnven forwardly out from under the machine which remains supported by the structures 200 and 202 and the pallets 244   The procedure ts reversed to again mount the machine on the tractor<br>
