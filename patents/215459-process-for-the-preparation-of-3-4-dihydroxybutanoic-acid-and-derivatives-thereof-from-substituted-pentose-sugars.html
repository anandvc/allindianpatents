				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and 3-hydroxy-y-bu tyro lactone therefrom starting with a pentose sugar source substituted in the 3-position, preferably in the chiral form. In particular, the process relates to the synthesis of (R)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and (R) 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone from a substituted L-pentose source. The process uses a base and a peroxide to convert the pentose source to chiral 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid. The chiral 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid can be further converted to 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone by acidification. The products are useful to the synthesis of various drugs and natural products.<br>
(2) Description Qt Related Art<br>
The current art on the oxidation of carbohydrates to 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives describe the transformation of substituted hexoses which are usually only of the D-configuration which upon conversion yield only the 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives in the (S)-conf iguration. In these reactions, chiral 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives thereof are synthesized from carbohydrates  by  oxidation  of 4-<br><br>
substituted hexoses with hydrogen peroxide. The chiral carbon atom is derived from the 5-position of the hexose sugar. Because most naturally occurring hexose sugars are of the D-configuration, this method is good only for preparation of (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives. In contrast to the position with hexose sugars, some pentose sugars such as xylose and arabinose occur in considerable amounts in the L-configuration.<br>
There are methods for transforming 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives to important molecules such as carnitine, however the process is extremely problematic staorting from the (S)-derivatives because the stereochemistry at the 3-position has to be inverted. The prior art describes chemical and enzymatic processes for the preparation of the (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives by oxidation of sugars, but not for the preparation of (R)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,994,597 and 5,087,751 to K. Inoue et al disclose methods for making optically active 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid derivatives by reacting R-3-chloro-l,2-propanediol made by stereo selective microorganism decomposition of racemic 3-chloro-l,2-propanediol.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,319,110 to R. Hollingsworth discloses a process for synthesis of an internal cyclic ester such as a lactone by converting a hexose source, which contains hexose as a substituent and another sugar attached to the hexose substituent in the 4 position via (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid as an intermediate. U.S. Patent No. 5,374,773 to R. Hollingsworth discloses a process for the synthesis (S)-3,4-hydroxybutanoic salt by converting a hexose source which contains hexose as a substituent and another sugar attached to the hexose substituent in the 4 position via (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid as an intermediate. U.S. Patent No. 5,292,939 to R. Hollingsworth discloses synthesis of (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid from substituted D-hexose.<br><br>
(S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid and derivatives, such as (S)-l,2,4 butanetriol that is formed by its reduction, are important 4-carbon compounds that are pivotal intermediates in the synthesis of various drugs and other natiiral products. These include the preparation of compounds such as eicosanoids (E. J. Corey et al. 1978. J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 100: 1942-1943), modified nucleic acid bases (H. Hayashi et al. 1973. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 95; 8749-8757), the polyol function of macrolide antibiotics (Y. Mori et al. 1988. Tetrahedron Letts. 29: 5419-5422), and (-) aplysistatin, an anticamcer agent (H. M. Shieh and G. D. Prestwich. 1982. Tetrahedraon Letts.  23: 4643-4646).<br>
A common route to the (S)-3-hydroxy-Y-hutyric acid or butyrolactone equivalent used in the above synthesis involves the use of malic acid as the chiral raw material. This is reduced to a triol and the two vicinal hydroxyl groups protected by acetylization with acetone and an acid catalyst. The remaining primary hydroxyl group is then oxidized to an aldehyde or acid and the acetal group is then removed. Preparation of (R) and (S) isomers of gamma-lactone from (R) or (S) malic acid has also been described by Uchikawa et al. 1988. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 61: 2025-2029. These routes have been of academic interest because malic acid is reasonably expensive and two groups have to be reduced to the level of an alcohol and one then selectively oxidized. (S)-3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone as a synthetic intermediate in the drug industry is a very expensive material.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to develop a process for transforming pentose sugars such as xylose and arabinose into useful building blocks for the preparation of chiral compounds for use in the drug, agri-chemical and advanced material science industries. In particular, it is desired that a method for oxidizing pentoses which would remove a 1 carbon from the reducing end and an oxygen from the 2-position give either the<br><br>
(R) or (S) isomer of 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives, using essentially the same reaction and depending on whether the D or L pentose is used.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for oxidizing a precursor compound which is a pentose, a furanose or a pentanal by removing a carbon from the reducing end and an oxygen from the 2-position which produces either the (R) or (S) isomer of 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives. The process uses essentially the same reaction conditions to produce either the (R) or (S) isomer of 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid and derivatives depending on whether a D or L pentose is used as the starting material. In particular, the invention provides a method for preparing 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid from a pentose, furanose, or pentanal in a reaction mixture comprising a peroxide in the presence of a base. Ilurther, the invention provides 3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone by treating 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid with an acid in the presence of heat.<br>
Objects<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a chiral 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid preferably in a chiral form from a pentose, furanose, or pentanal source. It is further an object of the present invention to provide a process which is simple, economical and inexpensive. These and other objects will become increasingly apparent by reference to the following description and the drawings.<br>

Figxires 8A and 8B are examples of 3,4-O-isopropylidene and 2,3-O-isopropylidene stibstituted pentoses, and Figure 8C is em exaample of 3,5-O-benzylidene substituted pentose.<br>
Furthermore, in the process of the present invention the 3-leaving group is selected from the group consisting of alkyloxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, halo, sulfonyloxy, sulfate, phosphate, and a saccharide and wherein (I) , (III) and (IV) are each a single chiral compound. In a preferred embodiment, (I) is an (R) isomer or an (S) isomer emd the pentose is selected from the group consisting of 3-O-methyl-arabinose, 3,4-0-methy 1-arabinose, 3,4-0-isopropylidene-arabinose, 3-0-galactopyranosyl-earabinose, and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-arabinose. In a most preferred embodiment the 2,4,5-trihydroxy-3-substituted-n-pentanal or other substituted pyranose or furanose is a D-sugar or a L-sugar.<br>
In performing the process of the present<br>
invention, the peroxide is selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen peroxide, alkaline earth<br>
peroxides, and combinations thereof, and the base is<br>
selected from the group consisting of alkaline earths,<br>
alkaline metals, substituted ammonixom hydroxides and<br>
combinations thereof. The selection of the peroxide and<br>
the base is well within the skill of the art. In<br>
performing the process, the solvent is selected from the<br>
group consisting of water and water miscible organic<br>
solvents,	methanol,	isopropanol,	dioxane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran	(THF),	dimethylformamide	and<br>
combinations thereof- In a preferred embodiment of the process, the peroxide is hydrogen peroxide and the base is sodium hydroxide.<br>
Preferably the sodixim hydroxide  or  potassium hydroxide molar concentration is between^ 1 to 2  fold of<br><br>
the total 3-leaving group "substituted pentose. The 3-leaving group substituted pentose source is preferably at least 0.05 percent up to 80% by weight per volume of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction of the base with the 3-leaving group substituted pentose source is conducted for at least 4 hours and preferably between about 10 and 24 hours. The reaction is conducted at a preferred temperature between 25°C and 80*^0. The base is between about 0.005 M and 0.2 H, wherein the hydrogen peroxide is between about 0.05 M and 0.2 M and wherein the 3-leaving group substituted pentose is at least about 0.05 percent by weight per volume of the reaction mixture.<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention, pentose sugars can be converted to chiral 3,4-dihydroxybutoic acid by oxidation with a peroxide source and a base if the pentose sugar is substituted with a leaving group at the 3-position. Figure l shows the conversion of a 3-leaving group substituted pyranose or furanose to 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid. The reaction proceeds by oxidation with a peroxide source and a base. As long as the 3-position is substituted with a leaving group, the substituted sugar is converted to 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid. In Figure 1, R in the l, 2, 4, or 5 positions is can be any combination of groups which includes but is not limited to the group consisting of hydroxy, alleyloxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, halo, sulfonyloxy, sulfate, phosphate. When R is not a hydroxy group it is defined as a protecting group and the position it occupies is protected. The 3-leaving group R1. can be any group which includes but is not limited to alky loxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, halo, sulfonyloxy, sulfate, phosphate.<br>
While the nature of the 3-leaving group is quite variable, the most easily obtained functionality is an alkoxy group. Hence 3-O-methyl pentoses are good substrates as are certain acetals such as 3,4-0-isopropylidene, 2,3-0-isopropylidene and 3,5-0-benzylidenc pentose acetals (Figures 8A, SB and 8C,<br><br>
respectively) . Acyl and oxiner ester substitutions and disaccharides such as 3-0-3-D-galactopyranosyl-D-arabinose are also useful substrates. Thus, in addition to pentoses having 3-leaving groups, pentoses having 3,4-leaving groups, 2,3-leaving groups and 3,5-leaving groups  are all  encompassed by the present   invention.<br>
The dihydroxybutyric acid can be converted to the corresponding S-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone (gamma-lactone) by acidification with a mineral acid, concentrating and then extracting the product into an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, dimethylformamide, or tetrzihydrofuran (THF) as shown in Figure 2. Gamma-lactone can be dehydrated, on heating in the presence of acid and under reduced pressure to yield the unsaturated lactone (2(5H)-furanone) . Treatment of the gamma-lactone with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid in the presence of ethanol will readily yield (R)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutanoic acid ethyl ester, a key fragment in chiral 3-hydroxy fatty acid synthesis.<br>
The preferred reactions are shown  in  schemes I,   II and III as follows:<br><br><br>
groups of D (Figure 1) resulting from the degradation of<br>
the 3-leaving group siibstituted pentose source occurs in<br>
the presence of alkaline hydrogen peroxide before any<br>
competing reactions to yield 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid<br>
(I)      which     is     stable     to     further     reaction.	On<br>
acidification of the reaction mixture, (I) undergoes spontaneous cyclization to yield gamma-lactone, 3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone (V), The gamma-lactone can be converted to the unsaturated lactone (VI) by distillation of the acidic reaction mixture under reduced pressure.<br>
3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid (I), COOH, RiOH and ROH were the only products formed from the 3-leaving group substituted pentose such as aurabinose when treated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide at 65°C for 10 hours. Acidification of the reaction mixture and concentration to dryness led to complete conversion of the 3,4-hydroxybutanoic acid to the gamma lactone. This could be isolated by chromatography on silica gel or converted to the unsaturated lactone by distillation of the acidic mixture under reduced pressure.<br>
It is to be understood that the chirality of any of the 3,4-hydroxybutanoic acid (I) , gamma-lactone (V) and unsaturated lactone (VI) products is dependant on the chirality of the 3-leaving group substituted pentose. For example a 3-leaving group substituted L-pentose will yield only (R) 3,4-hydroxybutanoic acid (I) , gamma-lactone (V) , or unsubstituted lactone (VI) , whereas a 3-leaving group substituted D-pentose will yield only (S) 3,4-hydroxybutanoic acid (I), gamma-lactone (V), or unsubstituted lactone, 2 (5H)-furanone (VI).<br>
The process of the present invention opens the<br>
way to the preparation, in high yield, of large<br>
guantities of valuable chiral building blocks from a<br>
cheap,     renewable,     natural    resource.	These    chiral<br>
building   blocks   can   be   used   in   the    pharmaceutical, chemical,   and polymer  industries and  reduce  dependence<br><br>
on petrochemicals.<br>
