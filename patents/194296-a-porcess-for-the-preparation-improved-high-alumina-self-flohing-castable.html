				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of improved high alumina self flowing castable. Refractory castables comprise of hydraulic setting high temperature cement and graded refractory aggregates. Various types of castables are prepared either by casting or by ramming. These castables give better thermal efficiency and more trouble free service compared to conventional brick lining. However, the conventional type of castables have some serious draw backs viz there is deterioration of strength at intermediate temperature ( 600 to 800°C ) and lowering of refractoriness due to higher amount of cement content in the mix resulting in higher content of CaO in the composition. Low cement castables are recent generation monolithics. These castables have much higher cold crushing strength and higher mechanical properties at elevated temperature because of less cement content and correspondingly less CaO content in the final mix. But certain constraints are encountered in application i.e. (1) Vibration is essential (2) Special mixture are required for efficient mixing (3) Some ingredients which are not readily available are to be used for preparing the composition.<br>
The main object is to provide a process for the manufacture of improved cement free high alumina self flowing castable which obviates the above noted drawbacks.<br>
Another object of the present invention relates to the development of a manufacturing process for production of dense cement free high alumina castables for industrial application with improved     properties     that     of     low     cement,      ultra      low     cement<br>
and conventional castables mentioned earlier. It also ensures elimination of vibration during casting.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of improved high alumina self flowing castable which comprises mixing fused alumina of particle size -80 +110 to -200 mesh, 15 to 35 wt% coarse &amp; fine sillimanite sand, 15-20 wt% Al2O3 of particle size 250 to 325 mesh, adding 10 to 15 wt% reactive silica solution and 0.05 to 0.10 wt% additive such as herein described, maintaining the pH in the range of 5 to 8, casting the resultant mixture, drying and firing the dried castable at a temperature in the range of 500°C to 1300°C, to get the desired alumina castable, the said process characterized in using additive which provides cold crushing strength and higher mechanical properties to the obtained castable at elevated temperature.<br>
The general relationship between pH and stability of silicic acid or colloidal silica is discussed in brief for better understanding of the complexity of bond mechanism.<br>
Above about pH 6 or 7 in the absence of soluble salts silica bears a strong negative charge and gel formation is rather slow. Gelling is most rapid at pH 5 -6. From 2 to 5, the charge on silica or silicic acid is low so that presumably the molecules can readily collide, However, in this region the rate of condensation between polysilicic acid molecules depends on the concentration of hydroxyl ions; the OH-1 ion therefore acts a catalyst for the condensation reaction. Below about pH 2, the rate of polymerization increases with greater acidity. The rate in this region below this pH is proportional to the concentration of H+.<br>
The reason for the minimum rate of polymerisation of silicic acid around pH 1 to 3 has been attributed due to catalytic action of traces of Flouride ion [ Since pure form of silicic acid also contain traces of flouride ion]. It has been observed that it is almost impossible to prepare solutions of silicic acid free from traces of Flouride ion . As little as 0.1 millilitre of Flouride  ion per litre has a marked effect.<br>
From pH 3 to 7 colloidal silica usually gel rapidly within the range pH 5 to 7. The reason is attributed by the fact that in faintly acidic range silica particles pass through isoelectric point where the particles are not charged and therefore come together rapidly. Thus below above pH 5, rate of reaction between colloidal silica particles is proportional to<br>
(1)	The no. of collisions &amp;<br>
(2)	The concentration of OH ions which catalyse the reaction when collision occurs. Above pH 4.5 , the polysilica acid molecules or particles begin to absorb OH ions and become negatively charged resulting fewer collisions resulting decrease in the rate of gel formation. The maximum rate of gelling is usually within the from pH 5 to 8 but exact point depends on various facts especially concentration of particle size.<br>
When colloidal silica are titreated upto pH 10 to 11.5, there is a strong point of inflection. This is due to dissolution or depolymerisation of polymerised silica.<br>
The  effect of additives in very minute  quantities have<br>
pronounced effect  on  change of pH and   subsequently gelation<br>
period.   The  additive  are HF, (NH4 )2  HPO4 ,  (NH4 )2   SO4 ,  Sod.<br><br>
hexameta Phosphate, MgCl2 , MgSO4 , MgO, &amp; CaO. Depending upon the<br><br>
requirement for setting time, 0.1% (NH4 )2  SO4  is added for which<br><br>
a  considerable  time  of gelation is obtained when  a  concrete<br>
/pumpable retains  its flow characteristics for a considerable<br>
time.  But when 0.1% MgO is added, setting is quicker.<br>
Process in Brief :<br>
The different ingredients namely fused alumina, sillimanite beach sand, Fine alumina, Reactive Silica solution bond and additives are mixed intensively in a mixture. The major ingra-dients namely Fused alumina, Sillimanite beach sand and fine alumina are mixed first and followed by additives and bonds. The whole mass is mixed for 2 to 3 minutes which leads to form the product mass which has flowing property suitable for casting in different shapes as per the requirements. The mass is cast in wooden or steel mould and kept for 24 hours after which<br>
the product is de-moulded and dried on air for 24 hours followed<br>
by drying at 110°C for 24 hours.  The material develop mechanical  strength  increase corrosion resistant and  improved high mechanical strength.  This products do not have any weakness  in<br>
strength in the intermediate temperature and product is suitable<br>
       in the entire temperature range of 110° to 1600°C.  The materi-<br>
 als are fired on different temperature like 500, 800, 900 1600°C<br>
and have been characterised.  The invention is described in the<br>
following 4 experiments :<br>
The process of the present invention is illustrated by the<br>
following examples which should not be construed to limit the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
Example - 1<br>
Fused Alumina	of the following particle size<br>
-8 + 10  mesh      -	40%<br>
-10 + 30  mesh      -	10%<br>
- 200     mesh       -	35%<br>
&amp; fine Al O	15%<br>
2 3<br>
were throughly mixed with to which 15% reactive silica solution &amp;<br>
0.1 % MgO were added.<br>
The mixture is then cast into cubical moulds.  After 24 hours the<br>
test pieces are removed from mould and allowed for drying for  24<br>
hrs in air and then in drier at 110°C for 24 hrs.  The dried test<br><br>
pieces were fired at 500°C, 800°C, 1300°C and 1600°C.<br>
The cubes were then characterised as follows :<br>
The RUL test were conducted on test pieces fired at 1300°C.<br>
The porosity, CCS, PLCR &amp; RUL were determined following standard<br>
procedure.<br>
This constitutes the aggregate having Al2O3 content 93% +.<br><br>
Example - 2<br>
600 gm of sillimanite sand (320 gm coarse &amp; 280 gm  fine)<br>
with fused Al 0  aggregates in the following ratio were mixed 2 3<br>
-8+10 mesh	280 gm<br>

cast  into cubical moulds.  After 24 hrs, the test pieces were<br>
o removed from mould allowed to dry in air and in oven  (at 110 C)<br>
o for  24  hrs each.  The test pieces were then  fired to  500 C,<br>
o       o       o 800 C,  1300 C &amp; 1600 C for property evaluation. This  constituents 70% Al 0  content. 2 3<br>

2 3<br>
which  16%  reactive  silica  solution  and  0.1%   sodiun<br>
hexametaphosphate were added. Requiste quantity of water was<br>
added thereafter.   The test pieces were air dried and then  at<br><br>
110°C  and fired to  500°C, 800°C 1300°C &amp; 1600°C and  and  their<br>
properties were evaluated.   This  constitutes  80%    alumina<br>
content.<br>
Example - 4<br>
Fused Alumina as the following particle size<br>
