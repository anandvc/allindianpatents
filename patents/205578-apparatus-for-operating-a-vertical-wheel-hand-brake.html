COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"APPARATUS FOR OPERATING A VERTICAL WHEEL HAND BRAKE"<br>
WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, of 1001 Air Brake Avenue, Wilmerding, Pennsylvania 15148, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a vertical wheel hand brake, and more particularly, to an apparatus for operating a vertical wheel hand brake.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior to the present invention, a railcar vertical hand brake includes a brake release mechanism that provides quick release of the brakes to permit free rotation of the winding gear. When a force is exerted on the release lever to move the attached brake release shaft, the main gear wheel is released, releasing the tension on the brake chain, which in turn releases the brake. Removing the force on the release lever re-engages the main gear wheel. However, the brake may not be fully released before the force is removed from the release lever. This condition will usually not be apparent to the operator. As the railcar negotiates a curve in the track, the truck rotates and can exert a pulling force on the brake' chain. This' action can apply the brakes to the truck while the train is in motion, resulting in friction and premature wear between the brake shoes and the wheels, and the wheels and the rail.<br><br>
Furthermore, a railcar vertical wheel hand brake is located on an end of the railcar. When the railcars are coupled together, the operator has to walk between two cars to apply and release the brakes. This practice not only poses a potential danger to the operator, but also is inefficient.<br>
An example of this type hand brake is taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,368,648. The teachings of this reference are incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>

The second shaft 64, third shaft 68, fifth shaft 90, and sixth shaft 94 will rotate substantially in conjunction when at least one of the first .hand brake wheel 48 and the second hand brake wheel 80 is rotated. Preferably, the rotation direction of the first hand brake wheel 48 and the second hand brake wheel 80 is clockwise; therefore a gear box 120 is provided to compensate when the hand brake 4 6 is operated from the second side 59. The railcar hand brake 46 can be remotely operated, and the brake status can be determined, from the opposing sides of the railcar.<br><br>
OPERATION Now refer again to Figure 1 of the drawings . When brake application is desired, the operator turns the hand<br>
brake wheel 14 in a clockwise direction.  the    reaction <br>
member  24  turns  simultaneously  and  engage! with  the <br><br>
activation means 26 of the brake release mecharadsm 30.<br><br>
This engagement causes the brake release shaft 22 and the release lever 32 of the brake release mechanism 30 to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, whereby, with the assistance of gravity, the release lever 32 drops into the brake applied position. The winding gear (not shown) of the hand brake 12 is now re-engaged to permit brake application. When brake release is required, the release lever 32 of the quick release mechanism 30 is rotated clockwise into the release position. The position of the release lever 32 visually indicates that the hand brake 12 has been applied or released.<br>
Now refer again to Figures 2, 3, and 4 of the drawings. When brake application is desired on a single .remote hand brake operation, the operator turns the hand brake wheel 14 in a clockwise direction. When the first shaft 18 is connected to the operating shaft 20 of the hand brake 12, this action causes the operating shaft 20 to rotate, whereby brake application begins, while the<br><br><br>
reaction member 24 simultaneously rotates intqs and "engages<br>
with  the  activation  means  26.    the  .activation<br><br>
means 2 6 and the second shaft 28 then rcstat in the<br>
•'      ■       .	\'*<br>
counterclockwise direction, which engages the winding gear (not shown) of the hand brake 12. The second  2 8 is . articulately connected to the third shaft 34, therefore the third shaft 34 rotates in conjunction. This counterclockwise rotation of the third shaft 34 causes the release lever 32 of the brake release mechanism 30 to rotate in the same counterclockwise direction. The release lever 32 drops into . the applied position to indicate that the brakes are applied.<br>
When brake release is required, the release lever 32 of the quick release mechanism 30 is rotated clockwise into the release position. This rotates the second shaft 28 clockwise, which synchronously rotates the attached brake release shaft 22, releasing the winding gear of the hand brake 12. The release lever 32 remains in this position as a pqsitive visual indicator that the brakes are released.<br>
Now refer again to Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings. When brake application is desired on a railcar with a remote hand brake operation on both sides of the car, the operator turns either the first hand brake wheel 48, or<br><br>
the second hand brake wheel 80 in a clockwise, direction.<br>
The first hand brake wheel 48 is located q'n the side of<br>
the railcar facing the first side 58 of the -ajjid brake 4 6<br><br>
located adjacent the center sill, and the cond hand brake wheel 80 is located on the opposite side,  facing the second side 59 of the hand brake 4 6 having the gear box 120.<br>
If the first hand brake wheel 48 is rotated clockwise, the first' shaft 52 connected to the first operating shaft 54 of the hand brake 4 6 causes the first operating shaft 54 to rotate, whereby brake application begins. The reaction member 60 simultaneously rotates into the activation means 62, rotating the second shaft 64 counterclockwise, which rotates the third shaft 68 counterclockwise because it is articulately connected to the second shaft 64. The brake release shaft 56 also rotates counterclockwise when the second shaft 64 is rotated. The release lever 70 of the first brake release mechanism 66 rotates counterclockwise and drops into the applied position, indicating brake application. The sixth shaft 94, connected to the third shaft 68, rotates counterclockwise. The fifth shaft 90, articulately connected to the sixth shaft 94, rotates clockwise, and causes the release, lever 92 of the second brake release<br><br><br>
mechanism 88 to rotate clockwise and drop into the applied position, indicating brake application. thus, the brake is remotely applied from the first side 58 * of the hand brake 46, but brake application can be determined frolfe either side of the car by visual observaticfta of - the release levers 70 and 92.<br>
If the second hand brake wheel 80 is rotated clockwise, the fourth shaft 84 connected to the second operating shaft 86 of the hand brake 46 causes the second operating shaft 86 to rotate, whereby brake application begins. The gear box 120, to which the second operating shaft 86 is connected, corrects the rotational direction to allow the second hand brake wheel 80 to be rotated in the same clockwise direction. As the first hand brake wheel 48 rotates in response to the rotation of the second hand brake wheel 80, the reaction member 60 rotates into and engages with the activation means 62. The activation means 62 rotates the second shaft 64 in a counterclockwise direction, causing the third shaft 68, which is articulately connected to the second shaft 64, to simultaneously rotate in the counterclockwise direction. The release lever 70 of the first brake release mechanism 66 rotates and drops into the applied position. The sixth shaft 94, located on the opposing side of the<br><br><br>
railcar and connected to the third shaft 68f, rotates simultaneously, causing the articulately connected fifth shaft 90 to rotate clockwise and drop into the applied position. Thus, the brake is remotely applied from the second side 59 of the hand brake 4 6, but brake application can be determined from either side of the car by visual observation of the release levers 70 and 92.<br>
Brake release is achieved in a similar manner by rotating one of the release levers' 70 and 92 in a clockwise direction to disengage the winding gear of the hand brake 46. Thus, the brake is remotely released from either side of the railcar 104, and can also be determined from either side of the car by visual observation of the release levers 70 and 92.<br>
Although the invention has been shown in connection with a certain specific embodiment, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and arrangement of parts and method may be made to suit requirements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
