INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LIMITED, a Public Limited Company, having its Head Office at G-9, All Yavar Jung Marg, Bandra (East), Mumbai 400 051, India.<br>
The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
GRANTED<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing premium grade Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and / or premium grade kerosene having negligible mercaptans, good color, low sulfur and low acidity from petroleum feed of same boiling range having undesirable properties such as high mercaptans content, high sulfur content and high acidity. The process uses a route where hydrogen is one of the reactants and the operating pressure is very low. More particularly, the present invention relates to a hydro-treatment process for preparing ATF and / or premium grade kerosene having mercaptans and sulfur contents less than 10 ppm and 250 ppm respectively from commercial ATF/kerosene feed mercaptans and sulfur contents in excess of 60 ppm and 2400 ppm respectively, said process comprising the step of reacting the commercial ATF/kerosene feed with a source of hydrogen in the presence of a Ni-Mo based catalyst at pressure in the range of 1-15 bar, temperature in the range of 150°C - 350°C and space velocity in the range of 4-6h~' in a reactor wherein the source of hydrogen to oil ratio is in the range of 125-250 Nm3/m3.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) demand is expected to increase rapidly in the wake of major developments in aviation industry and the refineries need to respond promptly to the challenge of producing premium grade ATF. Air travel is projected to grow in popularity in the years to come and the refinery that produces jet fuel at the lowest cost will be in the best position to compete in this market. The refinery that produces high quality jet fuels can find attractive markets for ATF product throughout the world. There is also huge demand for premium grade kerosene.<br>
ATF and / or premium grade kerosene can be produced through distillation of crude followed by some post-treatment or by hydroprocessing route. For the former case, mercaptan content is generally higher than specifications and is crude specific. In conventional hydroprocessing process, high pressure (of the order of at least 40 bars in hydrotreating and at least 160 bars in hydrocracking) is applied leading to very high equipment and operating costs.<br><br><br>
Mercaptan is the generic name for a family of organic compounds where sulfur and a hydrogen atom (SH) are bonded to one of the carbon atoms in the molecule. The hydrogen atom in the SH radical can ionize and produce a mildly acidic environment, which may lead to corrosion. The most noticeable characteristic of mercaptans is their strong, unpleasant odor even when their concentration is only a few parts per million. Many hydrocarbons contain sulfur in the form of mercaptans (thiols). Mercaptans are almost invariably present in LPG, cracked gasolene, straight run gasolines, natural gasolines, and in heavier hydrocarbon distillates including for example kerosene and fuel oil. Mercaptans need to be removed from ATF due to corrosion and odour problems. Other specifications of ATF include acidity, aromatics, olefins, smoke point, sulfur, mercaptans, freeze point, color, and water separation index, etc.<br>
The refinery production of jet fuel normally involves withdrawing a side stream product from the crude oil fractionator that requires caustic treatment followed by water washing, salt drying, and clay filtration. Certain polar compounds can be removed from jet fuel by clay treating. In this relatively simple process, the fuel is allowed to pass through a bed of clay. Certain classes of polar compounds, especially those that act as surfactants, adsorb onto the surface of the clay and thus are removed from the fuel. Removal of surfactants from hydrocarbon distillate using post treatment methods employing clay is well known in the art. Finally, the product may be subjected to other conventional treating methods so that the product can meet all jet fuel specifications. The conventional routes for removing mercaptans from ATF are extraction, adsorption, oxidation, extraction-oxidation technology, etc. which face severe problems like caustic handling, environmental fouling, inflexibility to different feedstocks, etc. There is also very little flexibility available to control product mercaptans level at varying feed mixes.<br>
There have been many attempts to provide processes, which would remove or convert mercaptans. Some of the earliest processes included treatment of the hydrocarbon fraction with caustic, clays, etc. A significant improvement in the treating of hydrocarbon fractions was made when the Merox Process was developed in 1950s.<br>
The art relating to the treatment of mercaptan containing sour hydrocarbon distillate and the regeneration of spent caustic solution is well developed and the processes and the apparatus therefore are subject of many patents the latest of which are discussed in this section.<br><br>
US Patent has been granted to Putman (6,231,752 Bl) for removal of mercaptans and diolefins from naphtha range feed using reactor system in hydrogen atmosphere but the process lacks capability for dealing with higher boiling feed (kerosene / diesel) and no claim for color or acidity improvement has been cited. US Patent No. 4,498^978 granted to Frame deals with a process for sweetening a sour hydrocarbon fraction (gasoline or kerosene) containing mercaptan with an oxidizing agent by passing the fraction and the oxidizing agent into contact with a heterogeneous admixture of a metal chelate mercaptan oxidation catalyst and a solid desiccant at about 70 bar pressure. A variation of the process has been reported in US Patent NQ. 4,498,977 where a solid carrier material having an average particle size of less than about 110 mesh has been applied. A process (US Patent No. 4,121,998) comprises contacting the sour distillate with a catalytic composite in the presence of an alkaline reagent at oxidation conditions. The catalytic composite comprises a solid adsorptive support impregnated with a polynuclear aromatic sulfonic acid and a metal phthalocyanine. US Patent Nos. 4,490,246 &amp; 4,199,440 have been granted to Verachtert for development of a process for catalyzed oxidation of mercaptans to disulfides (Merox). In another invention, the conversion is effected during passage of the hydrocarbon and an aqueous stream downward through a cylindrical mass of liquid-liquid contact material (US Patent No. 4,481,106). Urban has disclosed a process for oxidation of difficultly oxidisable mercaptans contained in petroleum fraction (US Patent No. 4,481,107). Another type of oxidation process has been invented by Carlson et al where the distillate is treated in contact with a solid composite prepared by impregnating high density activated charcoal particles with a metal phthalocyanine catalyst from an aqueous solution. The process, its variations (oxidation route) along with supported metal preparation, etc. have been granted US Patent Nos. 4,248,694; 4,141,819; 4,121,999; 4,113,604; 4,098,681; 4,087,378; 4,070,271; 4,033,860; 4,018,705 &amp; 4,003,827. In another method, the sour distillate is treated in contact with an oxidizing agent and a catalytic composite comprising a metal chelate mercaptan oxidation catalyst impregnated on a basic anion exchange resin (US Patent No. 4,206,043). A catalyst and method for converting mercaptans and mercaptide compounds in aqueous alkaline solution to disulfides where the catalytic agent is a metal complex synthesized from 3,3',4,4'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride has been awarded U.S. Patent (No. 4,090,954). US patents have been granted for various methodologies for preparation of catalysts (composite)<br><br><br>
particularly useful for the oxidation of mercaptans and / or removal of gums contained in a sour petroleum distillate (Nos. 4,364,843; 4,298,502; 4,124,531; 4,107,078; 3,972,829; 3,931,054).<br>
Mercaptan extraction process with recycled alkaline solution has been patented. In US Patent No. 4,362,614, granted to Asdigian, involves water removal from an alkaline solution which is used to extract mercaptans from a hydrocarbon stream by contacting the alkaline solution with a warm hydrocarbon vapor stream. US Patent Nos. 4,104,155 &amp; 4,040,947 have been granted to Christman for invention of a variation of mercaptan extraction process using stripped alkaline solution. US Patent No. 4,081,354 has been granted for liquid-liquid extraction process using caustic for removal of mercaptans from hydrocarbon streams.lt is claimed that high efficiency is obtained over a wide range of flow rates through a single extraction column by the provision of an intermediate product drawoff means located between a downstream section of extraction trays having greatest efficiency at low throughputs and an upstream section of trays having peak efficiency at high throughputs. US Patent Nos. 2,853,432; 2,921,021; 2,937,986 are also granted for this type of mercaptan extraction.<br>
A Japanese Patent (JP3292396) has been granted to Fuchigami Jun et al. on hydrotreatment route for production of good quality kerosene / gas oil of boiling range 340°C to 390°C using high hydrogen pressure of 20 - 70 bar.<br>
In order to meet the growing demand of high quality ATF &amp; premium grade kerosene (SKO), the current invention uses a novel low pressure hydroprocessing technology for production of premium grade ATF / SKO. The process has the capability of removing mercaptan / sulfur from ATF/kerosene at low pressure, moderate temperature, low hydrogen to oil ratio and high space velocity. It has been found that the process can reduce mercaptans to less than 10 ppm from commercial ATF/kerosene feed having more than 60 ppm mercaptan level. Acidity, colour and all other critical properties of the product are improved during the process of the present invention. The process of the present invention may also be used for removal of mercaptans and / or sulfur from other hydrocarbon stream having same boiling range.<br>

The present invention relates to a process for the production of ATF/ premium grade kerosene or similar hydrocarbon liquid containing very low mercaptans less than 10. The present invention also relates to a process for the production ATF/ premium grade kerosene or similar hydrocarbon liquid containing sulfur less than 250 ppm and acidity less than 0.024 mg KOH/gm<br>
Feed: The feed is of ATF/ kerosene range having boiling range of 140-280 °C having high mercaptans, high sulfur, high acidity and moderate colour.<br><br>
Catalyst: In this process, Nickel-Molybdenum supported on alumina is a preferred catalyst. The physical surface area of the support material is between 120-200 m2/g, the pore volume of the catalyst is between 0.2-0.6 cc/gm. The average pore diameter is between 70-130 °A. The metal dispersion of Ni on Al is between 0.1-0.4 and Mo on Al is between 0.6-0.9.<br>
Process: In this process, feed is reacted with hydrogen in presence of catalyst in a three phase reactor. More preferably the reaction is conducted in a tubular fixed bed reactor and most preferably, in a down flow trickle bed reactor. In this process, feed is heated to the reaction temperature between 150-350°C, and preferably between 200-300°C. Hydrogen is mixed with Feed at the pressure between 1 to 15 bar but more preferably between 4 to 15 bar and most ideally between 4 bar and 7 bar. Hydrogenation reaction takes place in the reactor on the active sites of catalyst under operating conditions as described above. The product coming out of the reactor is separated from unreacted Hydrogen in a separator. Very Little Hydrogen is introduced in excess to the stoichiometric amount to the reactor. As a result, there is no need to recycle less reacted hydrogen. In an embodiment of the present invention, catalytic reformer off gas can be applied instead of pure hydrogen gas providing same products properties. The process of the present invention can be extended to remove mercaptans and sulfur from other petroleum fractions, specially naphtha and diesel, but is not limited to these alone and can be used with petroleum hydrocarbon solvents having boiling point in the rage of 125° to 325° C.<br>
Product from the reactor is hydrocarbon stream of same boiling range as that of feed and substantially have very low mercaptans, low sulfur, low acidity, excellent colour and excellent product properties required for ATF/SKO.<br>
It may be noted that the reaction takes place in once-through configuration without hydrogen recycle. This leads to substantial economic benefit because the expensive hydrogen recycle compressor is not required in the system. In an embodiment of the invention, the liquid products obtained through once through operation can be recycled back and used as feed, which further decreases the undesirable components in the final products.<br>
The invention is illustrated by Example - 1. Hydrogen is required for this process, which is a costly component in the refinery. Hence, it would be economic to use reformer off gas as the source of hydrogen in the process. Example - 2 depicts an example of use of reformer off-gas for<br><br><br>
production of ATF. While the examples are provided to illustrate the present invention, these are not intended to limit it.<br>
