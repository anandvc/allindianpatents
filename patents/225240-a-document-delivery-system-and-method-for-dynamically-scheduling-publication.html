The present invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 09/325,040<br>
filed on June 7, 1999 entitled Document Delivery System for Automatically Printing a<br>
Document on a Printing Device, by Brewster, et al.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention generally relates to the printing field and, more particularly, to an agent<br>
and method for dynamically scheduling publication in an automated document delivery<br>
system.<br>
Background<br>
In the mid 1400's, Johann Gutenberg revolutionized how information is disseminated<br>
through his invention of the movable type press. With the publication of the Mazarin Bible,<br>
documents which were once held in the exclusive domain of a chosen few were now widely<br>
available to the masses. Nearly 550 years later, the mass media revolution that Gutenberg<br>
started is alive and well, complete with newspapers such as the New York Times and the<br>
Washington Post, magazines such as Newsweek and Sports Illustrated, and literally thousands<br>
upon thousands of other publications.<br>
While these thousands of publications cover a wide range of interests, from news to<br>
sports to fashion to model rocketry, they have one thing in common: they are intended to be<br>
read by a mass market. Unlike the pre-Gutenberg days, where a document would literally be<br>
read by only one person of a very small number of people, it is not economically viable for<br>
today's publications to have such a small readership, due at least in part to high marketing,<br>
production and distribution costs. In fact, many of today's publications are funded to a very<br>
large extent by the advertising contained within them. These advertisers are attracted to<br>
publications that can consistently deliver a large, reliable audience of consumers that will be<br>
exposed to their advertising.<br>
While this mass-market publication model has worked well for hundreds of years, it is<br>
not without its problems. One such problem is that a typical reader of a publication has a wide<br>
variety of interests, and no single mass market publication will be able to satisfy all of these<br>
interests. For example, a reader who is interested in international news, golf, fly-fishing,<br>
Genealogy, and computers may have to subscribe to several different publications to satisfy<br>
these interests. Of course, since these publications are intended for the mass market, they will<br>
also contain a significant amount of material that our reader is not interested in and will not<br>
read. It goes without saying that if there is a significant amount of material a read isn't<br>
reading, there is a significant amount of advertising that the reader isn't reading either- as well<br>
as a significant amount of paper that is wasted. Advertisers know this, and agree to pay<br>
considerably less to a mass market magazine or newspaper per 1000 exposures to their ad than<br>
they would pay to a direct-mail generator that can provide a more specific guarantee that the<br>
people exposed to their ad are of a demographic group that will be much more likely to read<br>
their ad and be interested in it.<br>
In addition, it is neither cost-effective nor time effective for most readers to subscribe to<br>
and/or read a large number of publications. Generally, the typical reader will only subscribe to<br>
a few publications that are of the most interest to them. The reduced readership level of the<br>
publications our typical reader chooses not to subscribe to, even though she might be interested<br>
in at least some of the editorial and advertising content contained inside, means that the<br>
publication receives less subscription and advertising revenue than they otherwise would. If<br>
many other readers make the same decision, the continued health of the publication may be in<br>
jeopardy, and the publication may be forced out of business. In fact, many publications do go<br>
out of business yearly for failing to attract a sustaining number of advertisers and readers -<br>
even if there are a large number of readers that would be interested in reading their publication,<br>
and a corresponding number of advertisers anxious to have these readers exposed to their ads.<br>
In general, publications that fail to attract a substantial mass market of people willing to pay<br>
for and/or read them cease publication. This is a shame, since many of these publications<br>
would enrich the diversity of information available to all readers, and would provide an avenue<br>
for lesser known writers and artists to practice their wares.<br>
In more recent years, a new type of publication has emerged: the electronic publication.<br>
Readers of these publications typically sign into the Internet through their computer, and read<br>
the publications online. Some of these publications, such as CINN.com and pointcast.com,<br>
allow users to state personal preference on what type of material they would like to read.<br>
Often, these personalized publications include advertising, usually in the form of a banner ad<br>
that is placed on along a periphery of the visual display (top, bottom, side, etc.).<br>
While these electronic publications have been an interesting development in the<br>
distribution of information, they still represent only a tiny fraction of the information that is<br>
published under the more traditional post-Gutenberg model. Many readers of these electronic<br>
publications complain that they are very difficult to read (on the video display), especially for<br>
long periods of time. While it might be convenient for a reader to sign onto the Internet to look<br>
at the CNN.com web site for a brief summary of late breaking news, this reader would most<br>
likely only spend a few minutes at the site, and would likely still subscribe to the more<br>
traditional print media such as Newsweek or the Washington Post. They would also likely<br>
spend significantly more time reading the more traditional printed publication than they would<br>
spend reading the electronic publication, and correspondingly, spend more time being exposed<br>
to the ads in the traditional printed publication. Accordingly, printed publications continue to<br>
flourish today - more than five centuries after Gutenberg made them possible - and after more<br>
than a decade after the innovation of the electronic publication.<br>
While these printed publications have certainly benefited modern society, no significant<br>
attempt has been made thus far to solve the underlying problems with these publications<br>
discussed above. Just such a solution is provided herein.<br>
Summary<br>
A document delivery system includes a database of content objects and a publishing<br>
agent. One or more of the content objects are selected and retrieved to generate a personalized<br>
publication. The publishing agent finalizes at least a partial layout of content objects and<br>
schedules publication of the personalized publication based, at least in part, on an evaluation of<br>
the content objects.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an innovative document delivery system, according<br>
to one embodiment of the invention. Document delivery system 10 contains document server<br>
100. In a preferred embodiment, document server 100 is operatively coupled via network 200<br>
to a variety of personal computers, printing devices, and other electronic devices, collectively<br>
referred to devices 300. As will be described more fully below, document server 100 contains<br>
an innovative edit module 120, transmission module 150 and knowledge module 170 to<br>
dynamically generate personalized publications from otherwise disparate content objects for<br>
requesting users/subscribers.<br>
Edit module 120 receives content object input from one or more content providers 50,<br>
and/or one or more advertising providers 80 to generate personalized documents based, at least<br>
in part, on a number of key criteria including, for example, user interests, seasonality, content<br>
provider and advertising provider distribution criteria, and the like. As used herein, content<br>
providers 50 are intended to include all providers of publication content non-inclusive of<br>
advertising, while advertising providers 80 provide advertising material. From a financial<br>
business model, these two sources of publication material differ significantly (content<br>
providers are paid a royalty from the operator of the document server, while advertisers pay to<br>
advertise in the generated publications), from the standpoint of the end-user they both provide<br>
content to the publication. Consequently, when used without a reference numeral the general<br>
term "content providers" is intended to include both content providers 50 and advertising<br>
providers 80. If a distinction is intended, the appropriate reference numeral will be specifically<br>
denoted.<br>
Distribution module 400 is operatively coupled to document server 100 and, as will be<br>
discussed, optionally distributes product and/or product subsidies to users based, at least in<br>
part, on the source and quantity of content provided to the users.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, document server 100 is a minicomputer/server, such as an<br>
HP 9000 server sold by the Hewlett-Packard Company, although those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that document server 100 could be any type of other computing or electronic<br>
device(s) that performs the functions described herein and still fall within the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention. Network 200 is preferably the Internet, although an Intranet, local area<br>
network, or other type of public or private network, either wired (e.g., telephone, cable TV,<br>
etc.) or wireless (e.g., satellite, radio, cell phone, etc.), could also or additionally be used.<br>
Devices 300 are shown in Fig. 1 as being capable of being configured in a wide variety<br>
of ways. For example, personal computer 310 is shown connected to printing device 320,<br>
which prints document 10320 for user 20320. Personal computer 310 is operatively coupled to<br>
network 200. In contrast, printing device 330, which prints document 10330 for user 20330, is<br>
operatively coupled to network 200 without an intervening personal computer or other<br>
electronic device. Printing device 350, which prints document 10350 for user 20350, is shown<br>
connected to electronic device 340, which could be a set top box, television set, palmtop<br>
personal digital assistant (PDA) or other type of electronic device that is operatively coupled to<br>
network 200. Finally, printing device 370, which prints document 10370 for user 20370, is<br>
connected to electronic device 360, which is operatively connected to network 200. The<br>
printing devices shown in Fig. 1 could be printers, such as the HP DeskJet 890 printer, HP<br>
LaserJet V printer, or other models of printers manufactured by HP or others; so-called<br>
"mopiers" or other multi-function printing devices that can print, fax, scan, and/or copy, or any<br>
other device capable of transferring information to a printable media such as plain paper,<br>
specialty paper, transparencies, or other media capable of tangibly receiving such information<br>
and which can be easily carried about by the user.<br>
Transmission module 150 is preferably located with document server 100. As Fig. 1<br>
shows, printing module 380 could be located in any of the devices 300, such as in personal<br>
computer 310, printing device 330, or electronic device 340, operatively coupled via network<br>
200 to document server 100, or it could be located within document server 100 itself, such as<br>
in knowledge module 170. According to one embodiment of the invention, transmission<br>
module 150 and printing module 380 represent software functions that execute on suitably<br>
programmed microprocessor(s) within a device 300 and/or document server 100. It will be<br>
appreciated, however, that special purpose hardware or other mechanisms could be employed<br>
to implement the innovative features and functions described below.<br>
Fig. 13 illustrates a block diagram of edit module 120 incorporating the teachings of the<br>
present invention. As shown, edit module 120 comprises one or more controllers) 502, an<br>
innovative publishing agent 504, an innovative virtual editor 506, memory space 508 and one<br>
or more input/output (I/O) interface(s) 510, each coupled as depicted. According to one<br>
implementation of the invention, edit module 120 may well contain one or more application(s)<br>
512 executable by controllers) 502. It will be appreciated that although depicted as separate<br>
and distinct functional entities, one or more functional blocks 502-510 may well be combined<br>
into common functional entities. Moreover, although depicted in accordance with a hardware<br>
paradigm, those skilled in the art will appreciate that edit module 120 and its constituent<br>
elements 502-510 may well be embodied as a series of executable instructions which, when<br>
executed by a host processor, implement the features and functions of edit module 120 to be<br>
discussed below. In this regard, Fig. 13 is merely illustrative of the scope and spirit of the<br>
claimed invention.<br>
As shown, controllers) 502 selectively invoke one or more of the virtual editor 506 to<br>
generate a custom document for a requesting and/or subscribing user, or publishing agent 504<br>
to complete the layout and optimize the delivery schedule of such custom documents.<br>
Controllers) 502 may initiate construction and/or delivery of a custom document in response<br>
to user interaction with a user interface (e.g., a web page), or to accommodate a user-selected<br>
delivery schedule. In this regard, controller 502 communicates with external applications (e.g.,<br>
web page) or other elements (e.g., a user profile) via input/output (I/O) interface(s) 510. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, controller 502 provides a user with a user interface with which to<br>
request/build a custom document using one or more of applications 512. But for<br>
implementation of the teachings of the present invention, controllers) 502 are intended to<br>
represent any of a broad range of control devices known in the art including, but not limited to,<br>
a programmable logic array (PLA), microprocessor, special purpose controller, application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and the like. In an alternate embodiment, controllers) 502<br>
are embodied as a series of executable instructions which, when executed, implement the<br>
control logic described herein.<br>
Memory device 508 and I/O interfaces) 510 are each intended to represent such<br>
devices commonly known in the art. I/O interface(s) 510, in particular, are intended to include<br>
one or more of any of a number of communication interfaces known in the art including, but<br>
not limited to, a direct connect communication interface (e.g., a serial interface, a parallel<br>
interface, a Universal Serial Bus (USB), an Advanced Graphic Port (AGP), etc.), a local area<br>
network interface (e.g., an Ethernet interface, a Token Ring interface, etc.), or a wide area<br>
network interface. In this regard, edit module 120 may communicate with any of a number of<br>
external and remote devices using an appropriate one of a plurality of wired and/or wireless<br>
I/O interfaces 510.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, virtual editor 506 personalizes<br>
publications for a unique, composite publication based on a number of factors. As shown,<br>
virtual editor 506 includes a content manager 518 and a construction agent 520. The content<br>
manager 518 includes an analysis/wrapper agent 522, a contract administrator function 524 and<br>
a transaction agent 526. As editor module 120 receives content from one or more content<br>
providers, content manager 518 is selectively invoked by controllers) 502. The<br>
analysis/wrapper agent 522 analyzes the received content and categorizes it based on any one<br>
or more of a number of attributes including, source, subject matter, length, cost, etc. In<br>
addition, analysis/wrapper agent 522 encapsulates the content object in a wrapper with a<br>
unique identifier. It will be appreciated, based on the description to follow, that the<br>
encapsulating wrapper enables virtual sensors (not shown) in the document distribution system<br>
to accurately track distribution, receipt and disposition of content objects. According to one<br>
embodiment, virtual sensors are embedded within printing modules 380 to track distribution,<br>
receipt and disposition of encapsulated content objects.<br>
According to one implementation, the contract administrator 524 is a database driven<br>
component that manages all of the contractual obligations of the users (subscribers, content<br>
providers, etc.) of the document delivery system. According to one implementation, contract<br>
administrator 524 maintains royalty calculation and display agreements for select content<br>
providers (e.g., artists), the advertising rates for other content providers (e.g., advertisers),<br>
subscription information for select users, and the like. Periodically, contract administrator 524<br>
accesses one or more content provider databases to identify content object distribution, to<br>
compute royalty payments, advertising bills and subscription bills for distribution to<br>
appropriate users via the transaction agent 526. In this regard, contract administrator 524<br>
ensures that contractual obligations of the document delivery system are adhered to.<br>
Transaction agent 526 is the primary interface between the document delivery system<br>
and a public/private e-commerce financial system (e.g., the CheckFree™ financial network<br>
offered by CheckFree Corporation). As introduced above, the transaction agent 526 is<br>
responsible for executing payments and account credit/debit transactions with user accounts<br>
based, at least in part, on the distribution of content objects in accordance with the terms and<br>
conditions maintained in contract administrator 524. It should be noted that although depicted<br>
as an element of edit module 120, those skilled in the art will appreciate that content manager<br>
518 may well be deployed as an separate and independent functional entity without deviating<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
The construction agent 520 of virtual editor 506 extracts content objects to generate a<br>
custom document according to one or more key contributors. As used herein, the key<br>
contributors include one or more of a requesting/subscribing user's interests, demographics,<br>
seasonality, document server requirements, and content provider usage criteria, and the like.<br>
As will be described in greater detail below, construction agent 520 extracts content objects<br>
which are likely to be of interest to a particular user and generates a personalized publication<br>
for that user. The construction agent 520 utilizes information received via overt and covert<br>
processes of document delivery system 10 to log a user's interaction and disposition of<br>
received material, as well as soliciting feedback from the user, to improve the user's<br>
satisfaction with subsequent personalized publications. Information gathered as a result of<br>
these overt/covert processes are used by construction agent 520 to update a user profile<br>
associated with the user, which is accessed when generating a personalized publication. In this<br>
regard, construction agent 520 performs functions commonly associated with a physical editor<br>
of, say, a magazine: publication content decisions, layout and format decisions, advertising and<br>
the like, yet it factors in other key information such as personal preferences to generate<br>
personalized publications for up to millions of individuals. Once construction agent 520 has<br>
extracted content objects to generate the publication, it is passed to publishing agent 504, to<br>
finalize layout and schedule delivery of the personalized publication to the intended<br>
recipient(s).<br>
In accordance with the illustrated example embodiment, publishing agent 504 is<br>
presented comprising schedule manager 514 and layout manager 516. As will be described in<br>
greater detail below, layout manager 516 receives the content objects from construction<br>
manager 506 and finalizes at least a partial layout of the personalized publication. According<br>
to one aspect of the invention, layout manager 516 maintains a record of the time required to<br>
complete at least a partial layout of the publication in order to determine the complexity of the<br>
personalized publication. This indicator of complexity is subsequently used by publishing<br>
agent 504 in estimating the time required to layout future publications containing one or more<br>
of the same content objects, and to aid schedule manager 514 in estimating the time required to<br>
complete publication.<br>
Once layout manager 516 has completed at least a partial layout of the publication,<br>
schedule manager 514 completes the publication layout (e.g., with last minute content objects,<br>
or updates to such objects), and schedules delivery of the personalized publication. According<br>
to one embodiment, to be described more fully below, schedule manager 514 utilizes<br>
information from a number of available sources to schedule delivery of the publication. More<br>
particularly, schedule manager 514 utilizes information from the user's personal profile, a<br>
complexity measure from layout manager 516, and an indication from printing devices<br>
associated with the user confirming that an adequate amount and type of media is available for<br>
printing the publication. Based, at least in part, on such information, schedule manager 514<br>
works to establish an optimum publication schedule for one or more personalized publications.<br>
Fig. 14 illustrates an example knowledge module 170, according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown, knowledge module 170 comprises user profile information<br>
602, content provider information 620, contract administration information 630, and optionally<br>
printing module 380 and printing schedule 390. As will be described more fully below, user<br>
profile information database 602 is utilized to collect information and develop a profile for<br>
users of system 10. Content provider information database 620 is employed to track content<br>
provider usage and disposition. Contract administration information database 630 is utilized to<br>
maintain information regarding licensing terms, rates, etc. By maintaining user profile<br>
information, content provider information and contract administration information, document<br>
server 100 is able to provide individualized service to user's and content providers alike. By<br>
dynamically acquiring and maintaining accurate information on the distribution, receipt and<br>
user disposition of publications at the content object level, document delivery server 100 is<br>
able to provide a personalized publication to the user accurately targeting the user's interests,<br>
while at the same time providing an accurate accounting to content providers for royalty and/or<br>
licensing fee purposes. In this regard, document delivery system 10 represents a revolutionary<br>
advance in the publishing industry, i.e., the ability to provide individually targeted publications<br>
on a scale heretofore available only to mass-media enterprises.<br>
Fig. 15 illustrates a block diagram of an example virtual sensor, according to one<br>
implementation of the present invention. As introduced above, one or more virtual sensors<br>
35000 are selectively distributed throughout document delivery system 10 to monitor and<br>
report on the distribution, receipt and user disposition of content objects. In addition, sensors<br>
35000 also track system and user actions taken on the content objects, e.g., a user could send<br>
email to an author, purchase an advertised product (e.g., over the Internet via a link provided in<br>
a received advertisement), etc. Moreover, tracking the distribution and receipt of content<br>
objects enables document delivery system 10 to automatically take action on the publications<br>
provided through system 10. For example, by tracking receipt of a "recent issue" of a<br>
publication, system 10 could automatically delete "old issues" of the publication (e.g., based<br>
on some expiration, etc.). According to one implementation, virtual sensor(s) 35000 are<br>
incorporated into printing module 380 throughout document delivery system 10. According to<br>
one implementation, sensors 35000 are additionally/alternatively deployed in one or more of<br>
devices 300 such as, for example, one or more computing devices, one or more printing<br>
devices, and/or one or more network infrastructure devices (not shown). It will be appreciated<br>
that the amount of information collected is at least loosely dependent upon the number of<br>
virtual sensors 35000 deployed throughout document delivery system 10.<br>
In accordance with the illustrated example embodiment of Fig. 15, virtual sensor 35000<br>
is shown comprising a monitoring agent 35002 and a reporting agent 35004, communicatively<br>
coupled as depicted. As used herein, monitoring agent 35002 receives network traffic and<br>
analyzes the traffic for distribution of content objects which are traceable back to a particular<br>
edit module (e.g., 120) and/or document delivery server (e.g., 100). According to one example<br>
implementation, monitoring agent 35002 analyzes the received network traffic for content<br>
objects wrapped in trace wrappers (to be described more fully below). The trace wrapper<br>
information uniquely identifies the content object and, optionally, the edit module or document<br>
delivery server responsible for the distribution of the content: object. Reporting agent 35004 is<br>
invoked to compile and issue a report to one or more document delivery server(s) 100<br>
identifying document distribution, receipt and user disposition of received content objects.<br>
Although illustrated in accordance with a hardware paradigm, the virtual sensor 35000 and/or<br>
one or more of its constituent elements may well be implemented by a series of executable<br>
instructions that carry out the functions to be described more fully below.<br>
Similarly, content provider information database 620 is used by document delivery<br>
system to maintain a history of content object distribution, receipt and disposition. According<br>
to one aspect of the invention, contract administrator 524 utilizes information maintained in<br>
content provider information database 620 to periodically calculate royalty payments,<br>
advertising bills, and subscription bills. Example user profile information and content provider<br>
information data structures are illustrated with reference to Figs. 16A and 16B.<br>
Fig. 16A graphically illustrates an example user profile data structure 602, suitable for<br>
use by the innovative document delivery system. According to the illustrated example<br>
implementation, user profile information data structure 602 includes a userjname field 604, a<br>
userid field 606. a contact information field 608, an interest information field 610, a<br>
subscription information field 612, a disposition information field 614, and a feedback<br>
information field 616. As introduced above, some of the information maintained in user<br>
profile data structure 602 is overtly obtained, e.g., by asking the user for such information<br>
during a registration period. Other information such as, for example, disposition information,<br>
is covertly obtained by monitoring the disposition of trace wrappers by the user, e.g., how<br>
much time did the user spend with certain information.-did the user forward certain<br>
information to others, etc. In this way, the user profile data structure 602 is a continuously<br>
evolving, continuously improving, set of information reflecting the current interests of the<br>
users of the document delivery system.<br>
Fig. 16B illustrates an example data structure comprising content provider information,<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with the illustrated<br>
example embodiment, content provider information data structure 620 includes a content<br>
provider name field 622, a content provider ID field 624, a wrapper ID field 626 for each of the<br>
content objects provided by the content provider, a rate schedule field 628, a monthly usage<br>
field 630 and feedback information field 630. As alluded to above, data structures of greater or<br>
less complexity may well be utilized to maintain user profile information and/or content<br>
provider information without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Turning to Figs. 2-4, flowcharts detailing the operation of transmission module 150 and<br>
a first mode of operation of printing module 380 are presented, according to one embodiment<br>
of the invention. In Figs. 2-4, the flow diagram shown in the left column is executed by<br>
transmission module 150 of document server 100, and the flow diagram in the right column is<br>
executed by printing module 380.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, the flow diagram for transmission module 150 starts in block<br>
1000, and the flow diagram for printing module 380 starts in block 2000. Since there is a great<br>
deal of interaction between these two flow diagrams, as represented by dashed lines connecting<br>
the two columns, the operation of the two flow diagrams will be described simultaneously.<br>
In block 2100, user profile data is sent to document server 100 to be stored in the user<br>
profile. This user profile data can take on many different forms, from simple to very detailed.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a very simply acquisition of user profile data, such as that used in HP's Instant<br>
Delivery Program, the first version of which was generally available to the public less than one<br>
year from the filing date of this patent application. In this program, only three pieces of<br>
information are stored in the user profile: type of printer, email address, and whether HP can<br>
contact the user. Fig. 6 shows a more complicated user profile than that currently used in HP's<br>
Instant Delivery Program, which includes the user's name, email address, company name, city,<br>
state, country, zip or postal code, phone number, printer information, and areas of interest.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that more or less user profile data from those shown in<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 could be sent to transmission module 150 in block 2100 and still fall within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention, and that at least some of this information could come from a<br>
source other than a user. For example, the user profile data could also include household<br>
income, age, and sex of the user, among other things. In any event, block 1100 receives the<br>
user profile data sent by block 2100. Block 1200 stores the user profile data, preferably in<br>
knowledge module 170. Alternately, the user profile data could be stored in device 300 or in<br>
some other local or remote location.<br>
Block 2200 checks to see whether a document should be received form document<br>
server 100. This is done by checking print schedule 390 which is preferably stored on a device<br>
300 or document server 100, but may be stored in some other local or remote location.<br>
Printing schedule 930 preferably contains information that can be used to determine when<br>
documents should be printed by the printing device, such as upon document creation, user<br>
requested time, lapse of specified time period, and/or occurrence of one or more external<br>
events (e.g., a stock price or index reaching a specified value, a final score of a sporting event,<br>
etc.). Printing schedule 390 may be associated with an individual user, a device or a group or<br>
users and/or devices. In addition, each entry of printing schedule 390 could result in the<br>
printing of one or more documents.<br>
Fig. 7 shows one example of printing schedule 390, of the type that might be used in an<br>
enhanced version of HP's Instant Delivery program. In this example, the title of delivery,<br>
delivery schedule, next delivery data and time, and the last deliver status are shown.<br>
Preferably, the user can select what time a document should be printed, whether it should be<br>
printed on a specific day of the week or month, weekdays, or weekends, and whether the<br>
printing schedule should expire after a specific period of time or continue indefinitely.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 2, printing module 380 monitors printing schedule 390 to see if<br>
a document should be requested from document server 100 or from another source. When<br>
block 2200 determines that a document should be requested from document server 100 or from<br>
another source, block 2200 is answered affirmatively, and block 2300 automatically requests<br>
the document without user intervention from server 100 or from another source, as will be<br>
described in greater detail below. Note that if printing module 380 is located on device 300,<br>
block 2200 operates in a "pull" mode - where the document is "pulled" from document server<br>
100 or another source to device 300. However, if printing module 380 is located remotely<br>
fre-n device 300, such as in document server 100, block 2200 operates in a "push" mode -<br>
where the document is "pushed" from document server 100 or another source to device 300. If<br>
block 2300 determines that the document is located on document server 100 or at another<br>
source accessible via network 200, and if device 300 is currently in a disconnected state where<br>
it is not operatively coupled to the network 200, block 2300 will sign on to or otherwise enter a<br>
connected state with network 200, so that device 300 is operatively coupled to network 200.<br>
Meanwhile, block 1300 checks to see if a document has been requested from printing<br>
module 380 in block 2300. Once it determines that such a document has been requested, block<br>
1400 generates the document for printing module 380. Block 1500 then sends the document to<br>
printing module 380. Block 2400 checks to see whether a document has been received from<br>
document server 100 via block 1500. Once such a document has been received, block 2500<br>
automatically prints the document, without user intervention, on a printing device. The term<br>
"without user intervention" means that a user is not directly involved in the printing operation;<br>
the document is sent automatically to a device 300 to be printed out by a printing device.<br>
According to this mode of operation, the user does not press "any" print buttons or otherwise<br>
be directly involved in the printing process; in fact, the user may not even be present in the<br>
same room, city, state, or country as device 300 during the printing operation. The printing<br>
operation automatically occurs in an unattended state - regardless of whether the user is<br>
present or not In addition, if print schedule 390 is stored in a device-independent manner,<br>
such as on document server 100, a travelling user could "log in" to document server 100 and<br>
have his or her customized document sent to a device 300 that is convenient to the user's<br>
current location.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, block 2600 checks to see whether the document printed<br>
successfully. If not, block 2800 performs error handling, such as attempting to print the<br>
document again, notifying the user that the printing device is out of paper or has some other<br>
error condition, or simply deciding not to print the document. When the document prints<br>
successfully, block 2900 informs document server 100 that the document printed successfully.<br>
Block 1600 waits for an indication from printing module 380 that the document did print<br>
successfully. When such an indication is received, block 1700 updates the user profile with<br>
this information.<br>
It will be appreciated that not all of the blocks in Figs. 2-4 need be implemented, or<br>
implemented according to the order denoted, to fall within the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention. More specifically, according to one implementation, flow of control moves from<br>
block 2600 to block 4100 of Fig. 4, as will be discussed later, and from block 1500 back to<br>
block 1300 of Fig. 2.<br>
An alternate embodiment has been contemplated where other information is transmitted<br>
back to document server 100 in block 2900 to update the user profile preferably stored in<br>
knowledge module 170. This other information could be ink usage (total usage or usage<br>
broken out by ink color), printable media usage (number of pages printed, type of media used,<br>
etc.), or other types of information. In addition, another-alternate embodiment has been<br>
contemplated where some or all of the information contained in the user profile stored in<br>
knowledge module 170 came from a source other than the user via printing module 380. For<br>
example, publicly or privately available information about the user, and/or the devices 300<br>
he/she/they use, could be acquired from a wide variety of different sources and inserted into<br>
the user profile preferably stored in knowledge module 170.<br>
Block 1800 examines the user profile preferably stored in knowledge module 170 to<br>
determine whether a product subsidy should be provide to the user. For example, if the<br>
information in the user profile indicates that this user has printed off his 1000th document, such<br>
as a "preferred" document that contains advertising from advertising providers 80 or is<br>
otherwise under the control of edit module 120, providing a product subsidy to the user may be<br>
warranted. For purposes of this invention, a "product subsidy" could be a print consumable or<br>
other product. A "print consumable" is an inkjet cartridge for an inkjet printer, ink for such an<br>
inkjet cartridge, a toner cartridge for a laser printer, toner for such a toner cartridge, or any<br>
other product or substance that is depleted when a document gets printed, including printer<br>
ribbons, etc. Note that the "ink" referred to above would typically be of a permanent variety,<br>
but erasable ink, such as that sold by the Eink Company, could also be used.<br>
Note that the product subsidy referred to herein is preferably funded at least in part by<br>
advertising revenue received from advertising providers 80 (Fig. 1), but an embodiment has<br>
been contemplated where the product subsidy is funded at least in part from the distribution<br>
revenue received from content providers 50 (Fig. 1). In either case, information (such as<br>
statistical information) about what was printed by whom is preferably provided to content<br>
providers 50 and/or advertising providers 80 - preferably as a document that is automatically<br>
sent to one or more printing devices according to the teachings of this invention.<br>
Other forms of products that are contemplated to be subsidized by this invention<br>
include printable media, such as plain paper, specialty paper, transparencies, and the like, and<br>
may also include devices 300 such as printing devices, electronic devices, and personal<br>
computers. In fact, alternate embodiments have been contemplated where other products, such<br>
as a subscription price to a document, or even a product not directly related to the document<br>
delivery system shown herein, such as soap or dog food, are subsidized. If block 1800<br>
determines that such a subsidy is warranted, block 1900 requests that distribution module 400<br>
provides such a subsidy to the user. In one embodiment, distribution module 400 simply mails<br>
a product such as a print consumable or other product such as the type described above to a<br>
user at the address specified in the user profile. In another embodiment, distribution module<br>
400 mails or electronically generates a coupon that the user can use to receive a free or<br>
discounted product of the type described above. Regardless of whether block 1800 is<br>
answered affirmatively or negatively, flow of control then returns back to block 1300 (Fig. 2)<br>
to see if another document has been requested from the printing module 380.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3, after block 2900 informs document server 100 that the<br>
document printed successfully, flow of control moves to block 4100 (Fig. 4), which checks<br>
with document server 100 to see what the current version of printing module 380 is. Block<br>
3100 checks to see whether such a request has been received, and when it is, block 3200 sends<br>
information concerning the current version of the printing module to printing module 380.<br>
Block 4200 compares this information from document server 100 with its own version and<br>
determines whether an updated version of printing module is available. For example, if<br>
printing module 380 is running version 4.0, and document server 100 indicates that version 4.1<br>
is the current version of printing module 380, block 4200 would determine that an updated<br>
version of printing module 380 is available, and flow control would move to block 4300.<br>
Block 4300 checks to see whether this updated version of printing module 380 should be<br>
requested to be downloaded. While a user would typically be asked whether such a download<br>
should be requested or not, and would typically perform this download at a convenient time,<br>
such a step could also be performed automatically without user intervention. If such a<br>
download is requested, block 4400 is answered affirmatively, and block 3500 downloads the<br>
updated printing module, which is then installed in block 4500. Regardless of how blocks<br>
4200 and 4300 are answered, flow of control moves to block 4600, which checks to see if a<br>
disconnected state should be entered. If block 2300 (Fig. 2) determined that device 300 was in<br>
a disconnected state when the document was requested, as discussed above (i.e., not<br>
operatiyely coupled to network 200), block 4600 is answered affirmatively, and block 4700<br>
reenters the disconnected state. In any event, flow of control returns to block 2200 of Fig. 2.<br>
Referring again to print schedule 390 shown in Fig. 7,, it can be seen that many different<br>
types of documents can be requested to be printed. For example, the title of document 11000<br>
specifies a network address, such as an Internet uniform resource locator (URL) that contains<br>
the network location of a document to be printed. Note that this URL may be partially or<br>
completely bidden from the user, as is the case with the URL for document 15000. In this<br>
scenario, edit module 120 of document server 100 merely goes out to the Internet at the URL<br>
indicated (which would be shown in Fig. 1 as one of the content providers 50), and captures<br>
the indicated document, which is then transmitted to a printing device via transmission module<br>
150 and printing module 380, as has been discussed. Alternatively, device 300 could go<br>
directly out to the URL itself without assistance from document server 100; in this case, block<br>
2300 (Fig. 2) requests document 11000 from another source - directly from the content<br>
provider 50 (at the indicated URL) via network 200.<br>
In contrast, document 12000 is not a document that originates with a content provider<br>
50 via the Internet, but instead is stored directly on device 300, such as a printing device,<br>
personal computer, or other electronic device. An example of such a document could be a<br>
daily calendar from a program such as Microsoft Outlook, which the user has requested be<br>
printed automatically to his printer, without any user intervention, at 7:00 a.m. every weekday<br>
morning. In such an embodiment, printing module 380 does not need to request the document<br>
from document server 100, since it can access the documents without going through network<br>
200. In this embodiment, block 2300 of Fig. 2 requests the document from another source -<br>
device 300. While block 2900 would still preferably indicate that the document was printed,<br>
and while block 1700 would still preferably update the user profile in knowledge module 170,<br>
printing such a document would preferably not generate any type of credit towards a product<br>
subsidy, since such a document would not be considered a "preferred" document, e.g., not a<br>
document under the control of edit module 120.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 7, a print schedule of document 13000 is shown. Document<br>
13000 is referred to as a "personalized document". A "personalized document" is a document<br>
that is assembled by edit module 120 of document server 100 from a variety of content<br>
providers 50 and advertising providers 80, based on information contained in the user profile<br>
stored in knowledge module 170. For example, document 13000 is a "personalized<br>
document". Our user has requested that document 13000 - his personalized newspaper - be<br>
printed at 6:00 a.m. every day. Edit module 120 examines the user's interests as specified in<br>
the user profile stored in knowledge module 170 to assemble the document from selected<br>
content providers 50 in which the user has indicated an interest. Edit module 120 also inserts<br>
advertising from selected advertising providers 80 - again based on the user profile stored in<br>
knowledge module 170.<br>
Fig. 8 shows how the print schedule 390 of Fig. 7 can be edited by the user. The user<br>
can use the publisher's recommended schedule, use a default schedule the user has set, or use a<br>
custom schedule for delivery. If a custom schedule is selected, the user can select a daily,<br>
weekly, or monthly delivery, or select a delivery once every specified number of days, or<br>
specify every weekday. In addition, the time of day can also be specified: once at a designated<br>
time, multiple times during the day, or multiple times separated by a specified period of time.<br>
While not shown here, the user could also edit print schedule 390 to request that a document be<br>
sent upon creation, or upon the occurrence of an external event<br>
Figs. 9A-9B show document 11000 printed by the printing device according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. Note that this document came from one content provider 50 via<br>
network 200 (either through document server 100 or directly), and contains no advertising.<br>
While document 11000 is preferably formatted by content provider 50 such that the<br>
information contained in the document is optimized to be printed, such formatting is not<br>
necessary.<br>
Fig. 10 shows document 12000 printed by the printing device according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. Note that this document is a user's daily calendar which came<br>
directly from device 300 and not from document server 100 via network 200.<br>
Figs. 11A-D show document 1300 printed by the printing device according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. Note thai this document is a user's personalized newspaper<br>
which contains information in which the user has indicated a specific interest in, as stored in<br>
the user profile in knowledge module 170. Note also that this document contains advertising<br>
that edit module 120 determined the user would also be interested in, again based on the<br>
information contained in the user profile stored in knowledge module 170. As has already<br>
been discussed, when the user prints a sufficient number of such "preferred" documents, the<br>
user may receive a product subsidy of a print consumable or other product(s).<br>
Fig. 12 shows document 14000 printed by the printing device according to one<br>
embodimefit of the present invention. Note that document 14000 is the HP Instant Delivery<br>
limes - a document located on document server 100. While this document does not contain<br>
advertising per se, it is still considered to be a "preferred document", since it is under the<br>
control of edit module 120. Document 14000 informs users of Instant Delivery of new releases<br>
or new information about the Instant Delivery Prc -am.<br>
Having introduced the basic operation of document delivery system 10, above, Figs.<br>
17-21 provide additional operational information regarding select aspects of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Accordingly, turning to Fig. 17, a flow chart illustrating an example method for<br>
generating a personali? d document is presented. As shown, the method begins with block<br>
1010, wherein editor module receives content objects from content providers 50 and /or<br>
advertising providers 80, and selectively invokes an instance of content manager 518. In<br>
response, content manager 518 classifies, wraps and stores each of the received content objects<br>
in one or more content stores (not shown), block 1015. More specifically, as introduced above,<br>
content manager 518 invokes an instance of analysis/wrapper agent 522 to analyze and<br>
encapsulate the received content object in a trace wrapper having a unique identifier.<br>
According to one implementation, analysis agent 522 identifies meta data within the received<br>
content object to classify the content object. Once the analysis agent 522 has classified and<br>
encapsulated the received content object in a wrapper, content manager 518 updates the<br>
content provider information data structure 620 associated with the provider of the content<br>
object to denote the wrapper identifier for the received content object.<br>
In block 1300, edit module 120 identifies whether an indication for construction of a<br>
personalized document has been received. As introduced above, such an indication may be<br>
generated by a requesting user via a user interface (e.g., a web page), or in response to an<br>
indication received from, for example, print schedule 390. In either case, if an indication is<br>
received, edit module 120 invokes an instance of the innovative virtual editor 506 to generate a<br>
personalized publication for delivery to the identified user. In this regard, virtual editor 506<br>
invokes an instance of construction agent 520, which obtains information from a user profile<br>
associated with the identified user to determine user interests, block 1410. In block 1415,<br>
construction agent 520 obtains information from the user profile 602 to determine the medium<br>
of choice (e.g., send the publication electronically via email, send via fax, send to a local<br>
printer of the user, etc.), interests, preferences and/or a history of received information.<br>
In block 1420, construction agent 520 determines whether the publication request is<br>
unique to an individual user, or whether the information has already been retrieved for another<br>
user. If content objects identified for publication have already been retrieved to satisfy another<br>
user request, construction agent 520 access local memory 508 to quickly retrieve the identified<br>
content objects, block 1425. Otherwise, in block 1430, construction agent 520 extracts the<br>
appropriate ones of the categorized content objects with which to generate a personalized<br>
publication.<br>
In block 1435, construction agent 520 generates an initial layout of the personalized<br>
document using the extracted information. According to one implementation, construction<br>
agent 520 identifies additional content objects based, at least in part, on the already extracted<br>
content objects and other key contributor criteria (e.g., seasonally, locality, etc.) introduced<br>
above. Moreover, construction agent 530 may also leave room in the layout for inclusion of<br>
content by a local content provider (e.g., an ISP), through which the personalized publication<br>
will be transmitted en route to the identified user.<br>
In block 1440, the construction agent 520 further optimizes document layout, updating<br>
the content provider information database 620 with an indication of which content objects have<br>
been utilized in construction of the personalized document. The personalized document<br>
created by construction agent 520 of virtual editor 506 is then sent to publishing agent 504,<br>
block 1445. As will be described below (Figs. 19 and 20), layout manager 516 of publishing<br>
agent finalizes the layout and content (except for last minute, time sensitive content objects),<br>
while scheduling manager 514 optimally schedules delivery of the publication to include such<br>
last minute, time sensitive content objects. Publishing agent 504 then issues the personalized<br>
document for delivery to the user via transmission module 150 and a printing module 380<br>
associated with the user.<br>
Turning to Fig. 18, a flow chart illustrating an example method of operation of an<br>
innovative printing module 380 is presented, according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As introduced above, printing module 380 may be located throughout document<br>
delivery system 10, and include a virtual sensor (not shown) which detects and identifies trace<br>
wrappers for content objects comprising received personalized publications, providing<br>
document server 100 with confirmation of receipt and user disposition of the content objects.<br>
According to the illustrated example embodiment of Fig. 18, the method begins with<br>
block 2695, wherein printing module 380 informs the publication server that the publication<br>
was successfully printed. In block 2900, the document server 100 is informed that the<br>
publication was successfully printed. In response, content manager 518 updates the usage<br>
fields of the content objects comprising the received personalized document, for accurate<br>
accounting to content providers 50 and advertising providers 80. In block 2905, printing<br>
module 380'covertly monitors user interaction with the received publication. As introduced<br>
above, this covert monitoring (via sensors 35000, client applications), etc.) records one or<br>
more of the distribution of content objects to a user, user receipt of content objects, whether the<br>
object(s) were printed or viewed on a display terminal, the duration viewed (if by terminal),<br>
whether any editing of the content object(s) occurred, and any other user interaction with the<br>
content object(s).<br>
In parallel, according to one embodiment of the present invention, printing module 380<br>
overtly queries the user for feedback on the received publication in general, and on one or<br>
more of the content objects in particular, block 2910. In block 2915, printing module<br>
determines whether the user has provided feedback.<br>
In block 2920, printing module 380 weighs user satisfaction based, at least in part, on<br>
observed user interaction with the received publication and any received feedback from the<br>
user. In block 1695, printing module 380 notes any further distribution of the content objects<br>
comprising the personalized publication, whether any edits/annotations were made to the<br>
publication, etc. and provides such information to edit module 120 to update user profile and<br>
content provider information data structures 602 and 620, respectively. System 10<br>
subsequently tracks the re-distribution, receipt and user disposition of the content objects to the<br>
new recipients as described above for the original recipient.<br>
Turning next to Figs. 19 and 20, the operation of the innovative publishing agent 504<br>
will be described. As introduced above, once construction agent 520 has compiled the<br>
components of a personalized publication, the construct of content objects is provided to<br>
publishing agent 504, block 1445. In block 1447, publishing agent 504 invokes an instance of<br>
layout manager 516 and an internal clock (not shown) is engaged to monitor the compilation<br>
time associated with at least the partial layout of the publication. According to one<br>
implementation, more complex measures are developed and maintained such as, for example,<br>
compilation time at a particular time of day, day of the week, etc. By maintaining this measure<br>
of compilation time, however complex or rudimentary, enables publishing agent 504 to<br>
improve publication and delivery scheduling.<br>
In block 1448, layout manager 516 determines whether the publication contains any<br>
time sensitive material. If so, a further determination is made of whether the delivery schedule<br>
must include time to obtain information (content objects) immediately prior to delivery of the<br>
publication, block 1451. If the publication does not contain time sensitive information (1449),<br>
or the delivery schedule does not require obtaining information immediately prior to delivery<br>
(1451), layout manager 516 receives the content objects from the virtual editor 506 to finalize<br>
the layout of the publication, block 1453. In block 1455, layout manager analyzes the content<br>
objects in light of the key contributor information and generates a final layout of the document.<br>
If the publication is to include last minute, time sensitive information (identified in<br>
blocks 1449 and 1451, respectively), layout manager 516 receives the content objects from the<br>
virtual editor and performs a partial final layout of the publication, leaving layout completion<br>
to the schedule manager 514 once the last minute content objects have been retrieved, block<br>
1454.<br>
In block 1457, upon completion of the final or partial-final layout of the publication,<br>
layout manager 516 disengages the internal clock, calculates the compilation time and updates<br>
a set of records regarding compilation time. According to one implementation, layout manager<br>
516 generates a measure of publication complexity and maintains a measure of estimated<br>
compilation time for varying degrees of publication complexity. The estimated compilation<br>
time may then be used to optimally schedule publication based, at least in part, on the<br>
complexity of the jobs.<br>
In block 1459, a layout manager 516 determines whether the publication is a unique<br>
document intended for one user, or whether it is to be "broadcast" to multiple recipients. If it<br>
is destined for a single user, layout manager forwards it to schedule manager 514. If, it is to be<br>
broadcast to multiple recipients, layout manager 516 first tabulates publication quantities in<br>
block 1461 before sending the publication to schedule manager 514, block 1460.<br>
Fig. 20 provides a flow chart of an example method for optimally scheduling<br>
publication, according to one aspect of the present invention. As shown, the process begins<br>
with block 1465, wherein schedule manager 514 receives a publication from layout manager<br>
516 and performs an initial load balancing calculation. According to one implementation,<br>
layout manager 516 provides schedule manager 514 with an estimate of compilation time,<br>
which schedule manager 514 references to optimally utilizes the resources of publishing agent<br>
504. The estimate of compilation time may be a quantitative value (e.g., the compilation time<br>
of layout manager 516 to layout the publication), or a qualitative value (e.g., an indication that<br>
the publication is of low, medium or high complexity).<br>
According to another implementation, schedule manager 514 identifies the intended<br>
recipient (and a related printing device) to determine print status, print media, media count, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, this information is retrieved from an printing module 380 associated with<br>
the user and/or identified printer. In an alternate embodiment, this information is provided by<br>
querying the printing device directly. Using this information, along with the compilation time<br>
information, schedule manager 514 can best identify which jobs can be completed in a certain<br>
time-frame, and further optimize the publication schedule. Schedule manager 516 then<br>
identifies an optimal publication start time based on, for example, the relative complexity of<br>
the received publication versus other scheduled publications. According to one embodiment,<br>
schedule manager 514 maintains a queue of publication jobs denoting the start time and<br>
estimated processing time for each publication.<br>
In block 1469, schedule manager 514 determines whether it is time to complete<br>
publication and delivery of a queued publication. If so, schedule manager 514 engages an<br>
internal clock to monitor compilation time, block 1471. As above, the measure of compilation<br>
time is useful for making future estimates of schedule manager 514 processing time for jobs of<br>
similar complexity, thereby iteratively developing a more accurate schedule manager 514.<br>
In block 1473, schedule manager 514 retrieves any last minute, time sensitive<br>
information for inclusion in the publication, and finalizes the layout of the publication<br>
including such content.<br>
In block 1475, schedule manager 514 continuously monitors whether the publisher<br>
agent 504 is on schedule to complete the publication within the allocated time. This is<br>
particularly important during, for example, publication of multiple quantities of a document.<br>
In such an instance, schedule manager continuously determines whether publication of all the<br>
documents is likely to occur. Assuming that publisher is currently on schedule, schedule<br>
manager 514 further determines in block 1477 whether publication is complete.<br>
Once publication is complete, schedule manager 514 disengages the internal clock<br>
measuring compilation time and records this information for use in future publication<br>
estimation and scheduling, block 1479. In block 1481, schedule manager 514 generates the<br>
document for delivery to printing module 380, and sends the document to transmission module<br>
150 for delivery to the printing modules 380, block 1495.<br>
If, in block 1475, above, schedule manager 514 determines that the publisher is not<br>
likely to complete the publication according to schedule, schedule manager 514 defaults on the<br>
publication in block 1483, so that it can maintain its publication schedule by moving on to the<br>
next publication job. In such an implementation, schedule manager 514 notifies system<br>
management to adjust the heuristic data and report the failed publications, block 1485. In<br>
block 1487, a default publication is generated and provided to printing module(s) 380, block<br>
1481. In an alternate implementation, rather than defaulting the current publication (1483),<br>
schedule manager 514 re-optimizes the publication schedule, shifting publication jobs in the<br>
queue as necessary to ensure publication of the current document.<br>
Turning next to Fig. 21, a flow chart of an example method for tracking distribution,<br>
receipt and disposition of individual content objects comprising a personalized publication is<br>
presented, according to one aspect of the present invention. As introduced above, whenever<br>
edit module 120 receives content (journalistic, artistic or advertising) it categorizes the content<br>
objects and encapsulates the object in a trace wrapper (graphically illustrated with reference to<br>
Fig. 22). The trace wrappers include uniquely identifiable markers which are associated with<br>
the content objects by the content manager 518 of the document delivery system 10. As<br>
introduced above, virtual sensor(s) 35000 embedded throughout the document delivery system<br>
(e.g., in printing modules 380, computing devices, printing devices, etc.) identify the<br>
distribution, receipt and user-interaction with content objects encapsulated in such wrappers.<br>
In this regard, the use of trace wrappers and virtual sensor(s) 35000 facilitate the covert<br>
monitoring of content object distribution and disposition from up to many points throughout<br>
document delivery system 10, document delivery server 100 with valuable feedback on which<br>
objects are of interest to particular users, the amount of distribution of content objects (e.g., for<br>
accounting purposes), and the like.<br>
As used herein, trace wrappers are non-invasive markers, i.e., they do not alter the<br>
content of the content objects. For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, an example of a<br>
personalized publication 6000 comprised of content objects embedded in trace wrappers<br>
6002(A). ..(N) is provided with reference to Fig. 22. As shown, content object 6004 is<br>
encapsulated within a trace wrapper 6002(A) with a "tag", or "marker" 6006 which is stored in<br>
content provider information data structure to uniquely identify the content object<br>
As shown, the method of Fig. 21 begins with block 5002, wherein the content manager<br>
518 of virtual editor 506 receives an report from one or more virtual sensor(s) that content<br>
objects have been sent through, or received by, identified users. In response, appropriate<br>
content manager 518 updates appropriate user profile(s) (block 5004) and content provider<br>
infonnation data structures (block 5006) to reflect the distribution, receipt and/or disposition of<br>
content objects. In block 5008, contract administrator 524 of content manager 518 periodically<br>
initiates financial transactions with content providers 50, advertising providers 80 and<br>
subscribing users.<br>
More specifically, contract administrator 524 initiates royalty payments for the<br>
distribution and receipt of content objects provided by select content providers, in accordance<br>
with contractual obligations established between the document delivery system and such<br>
content providers. In this regard, contract administrator identifies the usage of content objects<br>
associated with the content providers 50 to determine an accurate royalty payment, and<br>
instructs transaction agent 526 to complete the financial transaction, preferably via one of a<br>
number of electronic financial service networks. In such an instance, transaction agent 526<br>
initiates a payment to the financial service network account associated with the content<br>
providers 50 in the amount identified by contract administrator 524. Alternatively, transaction<br>
agent 526 may initiate printing of checks payable to the content providers 50 in a denomination<br>
indicated by contract administrator 524, wherein such printed checks are then mailed to the<br>
content providers 50. According to one aspect of the invention, the degree of accuracy with<br>
which content distribution and disposition is monitored within document delivery system 10<br>
facilitates "micro-transactions", i.e., electronic transactions which occur automatically with<br>
each system operation in which a financial obligation is created (as defined in contract<br>
administration information). According to one example embodiment, a financial account<br>
associated with a content provider 50 is credited with a royalty payment each time a content<br>
object associated with the content provider 50 is (re)distributed, This may amount to hundreds,<br>
thousands or millions of micro-transactions per day, per content provider. Transaction agent<br>
526 may initiate financial transactions as accrued lump sums transacted on a periodic basis, or<br>
based on reaching a monetary threshold (e.g., payments are made in $10 increments).<br>
Although described in the context of a royalty payment to a content provider 50, financial<br>
transaction agent 526 may alternatively debit accounts of advertising providers 80, or<br>
subscribing users on a micro-transaction, periodic or other lump-sum basis in much the same<br>
fashion as described above.<br>
Similarly, contract administrator 524 periodically calculates advertising usage for<br>
advertising providers 80, instructing transaction agent 526 to bill the identified advertising<br>
providers 80 based on advertising usage, placement, associations, and the like. As above,<br>
transaction agent 526 preferably carries this billing out via an electronic financial network, but<br>
may alternatively (or in addition) initiate the printing and mailing of physical bills to the<br>
advertising providers 80.<br>
