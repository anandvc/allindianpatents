"All in one Shaving Tool"<br>
Shri Gaianan Invention and Advanced Research Centre<br>
A division of SSGM College of Engineering<br>
with office at SSGM College of Engineering, Shegaon, Dist. Buldhana 444 203,<br>
Maharashtra, India.<br>
an organization constituted under the Maharashtra State Universities Act,<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE<br>
PERFORMED: -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to all in one shaving tool.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a shaving tool which has all the requisites paraphernalia such as shaving gel, shaving brush and a shaving razor arranged in a compact all in one shaving tool.<br>
Even more particularly, the present invention relates to a all in one shaving tool which consist of a shaving gel chamber which is forcedly pushed by piston device thereby guiding the shaving gel through the hollow chamber having an exit port wherein the shaving gel gets into the shaving brush chamber which consists of shaving brush and a device is also provided with the partial turning moment of shaving brush chamber and the device also holds alum strip case which is used as after shave.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Shaving devices of different types are known in the art. Usually, during the use of the shaving device with razor blades, first the user applies a shaving cream on the skin and distributes it over the skin with the help of shaving brush , and then the shaving device with the razor is used to shave the hair. The known shaving devices possess several disadvantages. First of all, they are not used for applying and distributing the shaving cream on the skin. It is necessary to apply and distribute the shaving cream on the skin by an additional device or by hand which is inconvenient and unpleasant. The known shaving devices with razor blades do not massage the user's skin during shaving.  Also, if the user<br><br><br>
wants to refresh and disinfect its skin with after shave like Alum, an additional device must be used. It is therefore desirable to improve the existing shaving devices<br>
Numerous attempts have been made to combine a razor assembly with a mechanism for dispensing shaving aid material. Some prior art devices disclose a reservoir disposed in the handle of the device for storing shaving aid material. The shaving aid material is propelled from the reservoir to the head of the device through one or more passages extending therebetween. A problem with providing a reservoir within the handle is that it is often necessary to make the handle uncomfortably large to accommodate a desirable amount of shaving aid material. If the handle is kept to a reasonable size, the volume of shaving aid material provided is undesirably small. Another problem with a shaving device having a reservoir containing a liquid or gel material is leakage.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to provide a shaving apparatus that overcomes these known shortcomings in the prior art.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The all in one shaving tool of the present invention includes a razor, a shaving brush chamber which holds shaving brush, a shaving gel chamber which holds the shaving gel and a chamber to hold an alum strip.<br>
The shaving gel from the shaving gel chamber is released by pushing a piston which releases the shaving gel and which is diverted by various arrangements to come right into the shaving brush chamber and to the shaving brush. Thus, a user can start applying the shaving gel on the facial surface with the help of the shaving brush. The razor is mounted at a specific angle on the housing. Once the user has shaved, he has an option to release the chamber for holding alum strip to use it as after shave to relieve him from abrasions and cuts caused during the shave.<br>
All the shaving aids like shaving gel, shaving brush and the slum strip can be refilled or replaced as the case may be. The razor to be used in this case could also be replaced to suitably opt for the best razor which gives the best shave.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
FIG 1 illustrates all in one new generation shaving tool (Numeral 10) that consist of shaving gel chamber (Numeral 12) which operates and releases the shaving gel when pushed by piston device (Numeral 22). The shaving gel passes through the guide ways path (Numeral 44) and then through the hollow chamber (Numeral 14) which has an exit port (Numeral 20) and the shaving gel finally gets into the shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16) ready to be used.<br><br><br>
The shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16) consists of shaving brush (Numeral 18). A device (Numeral 24) is provided with the partial turning moment of shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16).<br>
Also, there is a chamber provided (Numeral 26) to holds alum strip case (Numeral 28) which is used as after shave.<br>
FIG 2 (a) and (b) show function of shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16). A piston device (Numeral 22) forcing the shaving gel (Numeral 30) through the exit port (Numeral 20), it enters the shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16) and get spread on the shaving brush (Numeral 18). Further, the shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16) turn at angle through hinge support (Numeral 24). Shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16) is turned up to its limit through hinge support (Numeral 24). It gets into perfect position due to hinge locking assembly (Numeral 38). The shaving brush (Numeral 18) linked with brush holder turning arrangement (Numeral 40) having sliding plate (Numeral 34) through the sliding guide ways (Numeral 32) and is turned perpendicular to its shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16).<br>
FIG 3 shows the function of shaving gel chamber (Numeral 12). The shaving gel (Numeral 30) is forced by a device (Numeral 22) guide ways path (Numeral 44) in the hollow chamber (Numeral 14) and gets out through the exit port (Numeral 20). This shaving gel (Numeral 30) gets spread into the shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16). The shaving gel (Numeral 30) is refilled through the inlet port (Numeral 42).<br>
FIG 4 show the function of alum strip case (Numeral 28) which hold the alum strip (Numeral 46) supported by locking arrangement (Numeral 26).<br><br><br>
To use the all in one new generation shaving tool (Numeral 10) all a person is to do force the shaving gel (Numeral 30) out of the exit port (Numeral 20), the shaving gel (Numeral 30) get spread over the shaving brush (Numeral 18). The shaving brush (Numeral 18), contains shaving gel (Numeral 30) which comes out from the exit port (Numeral 20) in to the shaving chamber (Numeral 16). The brush arrangement slides through sliding guides (Numeral 34) through the sliding guide ways (Numeral 32) and is turned perpendicular to its shaving brush chamber (Numeral 16).<br>
The shaving gel (Numeral 30) can be placed through the shaving brush (Numeral 18) on skin to be shaved by razor (Numeral 48). When the shave is over, the alum strip (Numeral 46) can be used as after shave contained by alum strip case (Numeral 28). A holding is provided to hold the alum strip through the locking arrangement (Numeral 26). This alum strip (Numeral 46) can be turned as per the requirement of the user. The alum strip (Numeral 46) can be refilled after 20 or so shaves. Also, the shaving gel (Numeral 30) can be refilled after 3 shaves.<br>
While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and described and are pointed out in the annexed claims, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of invention.<br><br><br>
