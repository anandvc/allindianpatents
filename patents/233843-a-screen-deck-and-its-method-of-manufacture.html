				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a screening equipment and, in particular, to a<br>
screen deck useful for purposes such as coke screening which would provide for<br>
improving screening efficiency as well as favour enhancing the effective equipment<br>
life of a screen deck for carrying out such coke screening. The screen deck of the<br>
invention is adapted to be user friendly and particularly directed to increase the<br>
screening efficiency by avoiding jamming of slots usually encountered in screening<br>
operations. The screen deck of the invention would be cost effective and involve a<br>
simple manner of manufacture and yet facilitate free flow of material through the<br>
deck during the screening process thereby favouring wide scale and efficient use and<br>
application of such screening decks including for screening of coke.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that screening decks are conventionally used to carry out screening<br>
of variety of particulate materials/grains depending upon the openings / slots<br>
provided in the screening deck.<br>
The use of screening deck is thus one of the widely used and applied manners of<br>
separation of a mixture of various sizes of grains into two or more proportions by<br>
means of a screening surface. The screening surface is adapted to act as a multiple<br>
go-no-go gauge and final portion consisting of grains of more uniform size than<br>
those of the original mixture. Usually, the screening surfaces used for such<br>
screening of various sizes of grains may consist of woven wire, perforated or<br>
punched plates etc. These plates having such perforation / punched regions are<br>
either metallic such as steel or non-metallic such as rubber, polyurethane and the<br>
like. In common terminology, the entire screening equipment is usually known as<br>
screen while the screening surface where the actual separation of different size<br>
materials takes place is known as screen deck.<br>
It is common to the manufacture of such available varieties of screen decks,<br>
whether manufactured of steel plate or obtained of non-metallic sheets or in the<br>
form of woven wire to provide openings / perforations which are closed ones. These<br>
openings can be of different sizes and shape and configuration depending upon the<br>
end use of the screen deck. In particular, such openings in conventional screen<br>
decks are usually selected from square, rectangular, circular, hexagonal, tear-drop<br>
or any suitable shape as may be required for the purposes of selective screening of<br>
materials / grains. Importantly, however, all such varieties of the openings /<br>
perforations available in the presently used conventional screen deck known in the<br>
art are essentially closed openings i.e. such openings are closed from all sides. It is<br>
found that such closed openings in screen deck presently available usually covered<br>
less than 50% surface area of the screen deck.<br>
Moreover, the flow of material in such conventional screen decks having such closed<br>
opening/perforations usually take place along the longitudinal axis of the opening<br>
and very often it is experienced that jamming of the materials take place due to the<br>
obstruction created at the end of the openings. Also, such problem of jamming of<br>
openings with consequential loss of screen efficiency of the screening deck is<br>
aggravated if the material being screened is fine and moist.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a screen deck which<br>
would avoid the afore-discussed problems and limitations of the presently available<br>
screen decks having closed openings, especially, due to jamming of materials<br>
resulting from obstruction created at the end of the closed opening.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide a screen deck which<br>
would be simple and cost effective to manufacture and would facilitate free<br>
movement of material there through the opening of the screen deck thereby<br>
improving efficiency of the screen deck.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a screen deck which would<br>
be durable and tough and would therefore have a long effective working life span<br>
and would favour continued and regular use / application without problems of<br>
deterioration due to jamming of openings and / or failure of material of which the<br>
screen deck is obtained.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to the development of the<br>
screen deck which would be user friendly and improve the screening efficiency and<br>
overcome the deficiencies/limitations of the screen decks having punched, drilled,<br>
slotted closed opening presently in use.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
screen deck comprising:<br>
a thick plate having slots with opening there through along one side of each<br>
said slot with the plate material there between two adjacent slots defining<br>
finger like protrusions;<br>
said slots with one side opening favouring a jam free flow of material there<br>
through the slots with said finger like protrusions providing for relative<br>
movement between the two adjacent fingerlike protrusions facilitating fall of<br>
material there between during vibrations of the screen.<br>
In the above screen deck the said slots can comprise parallel slots wherein the gap<br>
at one end of the slot top feed end and the gap at the other discharge end of the<br>
slot is the same. The size of the slots is same in the vertical direction.<br>
Optionally, in the above screen deck of the invention the said slots can comprise<br>
diverging slots with divergence in vertical and/or horizontal directions. In such<br>
diverging slots, each said diverging slot can comprises of width of each said slot in<br>
the beginning feed end being less and at the discharge end being more.In particular,<br>
such diverging slot can comprise width of each slot being less on the top side of the<br>
deck and more on the bottom side of the deck favoring avoiding sticking of material<br>
and jamming of slots. Thus, the slots provided with a taper surfaces can have at<br>
the beginning/top of the deck a dimension of 18mm and at the end/bottom of the<br>
deck a dimension of 20mm.<br>
Preferably, the said finger like protrusions are coated with wear resistant material.<br>
The size of slots, screen decks are selectively provided based on the end use<br>
requirements. The thickness of the plate can comprises preferably thick steel plate<br>
of thickness in the range of 16-20mm. Thus, the plate thickness can comprise a<br>
dimension in the range of 16 to 20mm. This thickness should increase with width of<br>
the screen deck, so that fingers do not get broken due to longer cantilever arm.<br>
Plate dimensions such as 1200mm. X 500 mm. X16 mm can be used.<br>
The screen deck as above is adapted to be fixed to the screen selectively through<br>
fasteners /locking arrangement or welding.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for<br>
the manufacture of the screen deck comprising<br>
providing a plate of required thickness and dimensions and forming the slots therein<br>
following anyone or more of gas cutting and machining to thereby provide for slots<br>
with opening there through along one side of each said slot with the plate material<br>
there between two adjacent slots defining finger like protrusions.<br>
In the above method the said slots comprising said parallel or divergent slots are<br>
selectively provided following anyone or more of gas cutting and machining<br>
methods.<br>
The sizes of slots and screen deck are determined based on the end requirements<br>
selected from capacity of screen (tonnes/hr.),size of materials to be screened,<br>
material that remains above the screening surface and material required to pass<br>
through the screening surface.<br>
Preferably, the fingerlike protrusions are coated with wear resistant material<br>
following preferably using hard facing electrodes or application of paste and fusing<br>
using with gas torch.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the afore disclosed screen deck of the invention to<br>
provide for a screening equipment suitable for coke screening and the like with<br>
improved efficiency and also favour user friendly manufacture and use of screening<br>
decks. Importantly, the screen deck of the invention is directed to avoid the<br>
problems of jamming encountered in presently available decks of punched, drilled,<br>
slotted closed openings by way of providing the slot with an open end through out<br>
along one side of the slot.<br>
The above selective provision for slot with opening in one side and in the process<br>
defining of finger like protrusion between slots on one hand favour free flow of the<br>
material through the slots and also the finger like protrusions which are adapted for<br>
relative movement in between two adjoining fingers during vibration of the screen<br>
further facilitate the fall of the material through the slot. Such an arrangement<br>
totally takes care of slot jamming in conventional decks with closed opening.<br>
Moreover, the screen deck of the invention having such selective openings for the<br>
slot is directed to favour simple and cost effective manufacture of such screen decks<br>
without involving the complex and cost extensive process of punching or drilling of<br>
openings in screen decks presently followed in the art. In particular, the screen deck<br>
of the invention can be obtained very simply by making the slots of desired size for<br>
following simple processes of gas cutting and machining. The above method of<br>
manufacture of screen deck without the requirement of drilling or punching of<br>
openings further enable the use of thick and durable plates for such screen deck<br>
which was not possible in manufacture of decks involving / punching or drilling of<br>
slots. Thus, thick steel plates with thickness ranging from 16 to 20mm. can be used<br>
to manufacture screen deck in accordance with the invention. This necessarily<br>
enables better life span of screen decks and continued effective use for screening<br>
purposes.<br>
As would be apparent from the above, the screen deck of the invention having the<br>
slots separated from one another by finger like protrusion can be obtained with the<br>
slots parallel i.e. the gap between one end of the slot (beginning) and gap at the<br>
other end of the slot being same both in the horizontal and vertical direction and<br>
achieve the required jam free flow of material through the slots.<br>
In accordance with the preferred aspect, optionally, the slots there between the<br>
finger like protrusion in the screening deck of the invention can be provided with<br>
features such that the slot is diverging in both the directions i.e. in horizontal<br>
direction and in the vertical direction. In case of such diverging slot, the width of the<br>
slot is less in the beginning i.e. the material feed side and more in the discharge end<br>
side. Similarly, the slot on the top side of the deck is less and more towards the<br>
bottom side of the deck to avoid any sticking of the materials this is being, screened.<br>
The sizes of the slots in the screening deck can be variable and are usually decided<br>
based on the end use requirement of the screening deck. In particular, the size of<br>
the slot, screen deck which can be variable can be decided on different specific<br>
requirements like capacity of screen (tones/hour) size of materials being screened,<br>
material remaining above the screening surface i.e. oversize or plus materials and<br>
the material passing through the screening surface i.e. undersize or minus material.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a screen deck which<br>
is substantially different from ail varieties of existing / available screen decks<br>
presently used having the closed jam causing slots. Importantly, the screen deck of<br>
the invention avoids the limitation of the closed openings which is usually provided<br>
in conventional screen deck obtained by way of pushed or drilled openings or woven<br>
screen decks which can now be avoided and favour user friendly application and use<br>
of such screen deck especially for screening of coke.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in<br>
greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the screen deck of<br>
the invention as per the following accompanying figures:<br>
BRIEF PESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 : illustrates different types of punched, drilled screen decks presently in<br>
use;<br>
Figure 2 : illustrate a woven screen deck also available in the art; and<br>
Figure 3: illustrate the screen deck obtained avoiding the closed opening in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
Reference in first invited to accompanying figure 1 which illustrates various types of<br>
screen decks (SD) presently available which are obtained involving the conventional<br>
punching or drilling technique. As apparent from said figure 1 the conventional<br>
screen deck having such closed opening (CO) are provided with openings of variety<br>
of shapes such as including square, rectangular, circular, hexagonal, tear drop and<br>
any other suitable shape. However, all such openings (CO) are usually closed from<br>
all sides and the openings usually cover less than 50% surface area of the screen<br>
deck. In fact, usually, the flow of material such as in case of rectangular openings is<br>
along the longitudinal axis of the opening and jamming of materials takes place due<br>
to the obstruction created at the end of the opening. Such problem of obstruction of<br>
opening is further aggravated if the materials being screened are fine and moist.<br>
Thus, such varieties of presently available screen decks with such closed openings<br>
(CO) have limitations or disadvantages in terms of the possible jamming of the flow<br>
path of the material through the closed opening of the screen decks.<br>
Reference is now invited to the accompanying figure 2, which illustrates a variety of<br>
woven screen deck (WSD), which is also presently available as a conventional<br>
variety of screen deck for screening purposes. Importantly, the woven screen deck<br>
as shown in said figure is also provided with dosed opening (CO) as in case of<br>
punched or drilled openings of the screen decks as shown in Figure 1. Accordingly,<br>
the woven screen deck having such closed opening is also having similar limitation<br>
of jamming of openings as discussed in case of the variety of punched / drilled<br>
closed opening of the screen decks of figure 1 above.<br>
The screen deck of the invention is illustrated by way of an embodiment and<br>
reference is now invited to the accompanying figure 3 which shows the screen deck<br>
with open slots (OS), which are not having the usually known closed opening as per<br>
figures 1 and 2 above. As apparent from the said figure 3, in accordance with this<br>
embodiment of the screen deck of the invention the slots (OS) in the screen deck<br>
(SD) are not provided with closed opening and instead define slots which have<br>
opening along one side to thereby provide for finger like projection (FP) there<br>
between the open side of the slots. As per the embodiment of figure 3 the slots are<br>
parallel that is gap at one end of the slots (feed end) is maintained same as that of<br>
the gap on the other end of the slot i.e. the discharge end. The size of the slot<br>
according to this embodiment is also same in the vertical direction.<br>
The deck illustrated in figure 3 can be obtained of steel plate of 1200mm. x 500mm.<br>
and 16mm thickness from high quality special steel and the slots of selected sizes<br>
made through gas cutting and machining. Importantly, the slots, which have one<br>
open side, provide for free flow of material through the slots. There between the<br>
slots individual finger like protrusion are provided. Since these individual fingers also<br>
vibrate with the screen, relative movement in between two adjoining fingers takes<br>
place, which further facilitate the fall of material.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention the slots can be provided with<br>
taper surfaces in both the directions i.e. horizontal and vertical. In other words,<br>
width of slots can increase gradually towards the end. In the beginning it can be<br>
about 18mm. and at the end about 20mm. Slots having diverging configuration in<br>
the vertical plane can also be provided. Taper has been proposed also to avoid<br>
jamming of material. Also as mentioned above the individual fingers, which vibrate<br>
with the screen provide for relative movement in between two adjoining fingers<br>
which further facilitate the fall of materials.<br>
The material between two slots is termed as finger like projections and is preferably<br>
coated with wear resistant material. Method of coating can vary i.e. it can be either<br>
with hard facing electrodes or through other methods like application of paste and<br>
fusing the same with gas torch. The screen deck is adapted to be fixed to the screen<br>
either through fasteners (properly locked) or welded.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the size of the slot in the screen deck of the invention can also<br>
be variable and are usually depended on different specific requirements like capacity<br>
of screen (tones/hour), size of material being screened, material that should remain<br>
above the screening surface, i.e. oversize of plus material and material passing<br>
through the screen surface i.e. undersize or minus material.<br>
Also, the screening efficiency of the screen deck of the invention was studied vis-a-<br>
vis the known rod screen deck and the results are reproduced hereunder in TABLE 1.<br>
It is found based on the above results that it is possible by way of the above<br>
disclosed screen deck of the invention to improve the screening efficiency of the<br>
deck such as. when used for coke screening. It is found that the +20 mm. Fraction,<br>
which were 16% or more could be reduced 2-3% on average. This can lead to<br>
saying of +20mm. coke which can be used in blast furnace and reduce the load on<br>
crushers. With controlled size of input material to crusher, output of crusher is also<br>
uniform which can lead to at least four fold increase in screen deck life and drastic<br>
decrease in maintenance activities.<br>
