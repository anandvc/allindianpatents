"AN APPARATUS FOR DIVERTING DIGESTIVE SECRETIONS<br>
DISCHARGED INTO A PATIENT'S INTESTINAL TRACT"<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
It is generally recognized that the mouth is the beginning of the digestive tract,<br>
also known as the alimentary tract. Digestion starts as soon as you take the first bite<br>
of a meal. Chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily digested, while<br>
saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breaking it down into a form the body<br>
can absorb and use. The throat, also called the pharynx, is the next destination for<br>
food. From here, food travels to the esophagus or swallowing tube.<br>
The esophagus is a muscular tube extending from the pharynx to the<br>
stomach. By means of a series of contractions, called peristalsis, the esophagus<br>
delivers food to the stomach. Just before the connection to the stomach there is a<br>
zone of high pressure, called the lower esophageal sphincter, which functions<br>
something like a valve to keep food from passing backwards into the esophagus.<br>
The stomach is a sac-like organ with strong muscular walls. In addition to holding the<br>
food, it is also a mixer and grinder. The stomach secretes acid and powerful<br>
enzymes that continue the process of breaking the food down. When food leaves the<br>
stomach, it is the consistency of a liquid or paste. From there the food moves to the<br>
small intestine.<br>
The small intestine is a long tube loosely coiled in the abdomen and is made<br>
up of three segments (the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). The small intestine<br>
continues the process of breaking down food by using digestive secretions<br>
comprising enzymes released by the pancreas and bile from the liver. Peristalsis is<br>
also at work in the small intestine, moving food through and mixing it up with<br>
digestive secretions. The duodenum is largely responsible for continuing the process<br>
of breaking down food, with the jejunum and ileum being mainly responsible for the<br>
absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.<br>
Three organs help the stomach and small intestine digest food: the pancreas,<br>
liver, and gallbladder. Among other functions, the pancreas secretes enzymes into<br>
the small intestine. These enzymes break down protein, fat, and carbohydrate from<br>
the food we eat. The liver has many functions, two of which are to make and secrete<br>
bile, and to cleanse and purify the blood coming from the small intestine containing<br>
the nutrients just absorbed. Bile is a compound that aids in the digestion of fat and<br>
eliminates waste products from the blood. The gallbladder is a reservoir that sits just<br>
under the liver and stores bile. Bile travels from the liver to the gallbladder through a<br>
channel called the cystic duct. During a meal, the gallbladder contracts sending bile<br><br>
to the small intestine. Once introduced into the small intestine, the bile and<br>
pancreatic secretions aid in the digestion of food.<br>
Once the nutrients have been absorbed and the leftover liquid has passed<br>
through the small intestine, the remainder is passed to the large intestine, or colon.<br>
The colon is a long muscular tube that connects the small intestine to the rectum. It<br>
is made up of the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and<br>
the sigmoid colon that connects to the rectum. Stool, or waste left over from the<br>
digestive process, is passed through the colon by means of peristalsis, first in a<br>
liquid state and ultimately in solid form. As stool passes through the colon, the rest of<br>
the water is removed. Stool is stored in the sigmoid colon until a mass movement<br>
empties it into the rectum. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. These<br>
bacteria perform several useful functions, such as synthesizing various vitamins,<br>
processing waste products and food particles, and protecting against harmful<br>
bacteria. When the descending colon becomes full of stool, or feces, it empties its<br>
contents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination.<br>
The rectum is a short chamber that connects the colon to the anus. It is the<br>
rectum's job to receive stool from the colon and to hold the stool until evacuation<br>
happens. When anything (gas or stool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a<br>
message to the brain. The brain then decides if the rectal contents can be released<br>
or not. If they can, the sphincters relax and the rectum contracts, expelling its<br>
contents. If the contents cannot be expelled, the sphincters contract and the rectum<br>
accommodates, so that the sensation temporarily goes away.<br>
The anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It consists of the pelvic floor<br>
muscles and the two anal sphincters (internal and external muscles). The lining of<br>
the upper anus is specialized to detect rectal contents, indicating whether the<br>
contents are liquid, gas, or solid. The pelvic floor muscle creates an angle between<br>
the rectum and the anus that stops stool from coming out when it is not supposed to.<br>
The anal sphincters provide fine control of stool. The internal sphincter is always<br>
tight, except when stool enters the rectum.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One example of the invention is an apparatus for diverting digestive<br>
secretions, such as bile or pancreatic secretions. The apparatus comprises a tube<br>
which when deployed is positioned substantially within the small intestine. The tube<br><br>
comprises a proximal end which when deployed is operative to receive digestive<br>
secretions, a distal end which when deployed is operative to discharge the digestive<br>
secretions into the alimentary tract, and a tube wall having an inner surface and an<br>
outer surface, the tube wall inner surface defining passage extending between the<br>
proximal and distal ends. When deployed the passage is operative to transfer the<br>
digestive secretions from the proximal end to the distal end and the tube wall is<br>
operative to separate the digestive secretions from food in the small intestine.<br>
Another example of the invention is an apparatus to facilitate nutritional<br>
malabsorption by diverting bile and pancreatic secretions. A tube comprises a<br>
proximal end, a distal end, a tube wall having an inner surface and an outer surface,<br>
and a passage extending between the proximal end and distal end and being<br>
defined by the inner surface of the wall. A stent is connected to the proximal end of<br>
the tube and being dimensioned for engaging an anatomical lumen (such as the<br>
hepatopancreatic ampulla, bile duct, pancreatic duct, and/or duodenum) through<br>
which digestive secretions flow. When deployed in a patient the stent is positioned<br>
in the anatomical lumen, a substantial portion of the tube is positioned in the small<br>
intestine, and the bile and pancreatic secretions of the patient enter the proximal<br>
end, flow through the passage and discharge from the distal end into the small<br>
intestine or large intestine thereby reducing digestive contact between the bile and<br>
pancreatic secretions and food in the small intestine.<br>
Yet another example of the invention is a method to treat obesity by diverting<br>
digestive secretions to facilitate malabsorption. A tube is placed in the small intestine<br>
of a patient, the tube comprising a proximal end, a distal end, a tube wall having an<br>
inner surface and an outer surface, a passage extending between the proximal end<br>
and distal end and being defined by the inner surface of the wall, and a stent<br>
connected to the proximal end. The stent is attached in or near the major duodenal<br>
papilla such that the proximal end of the tube receives bile and pancreatic<br>
secretions. The distal end of the tube is in the small intestine of a patient in a<br>
location distal to the major duodenal papilla. Digestive contact is prevented between<br>
the bile and pancreatic secretions and food in the small intestine by passing bile and<br>
pancreatic secretions through the tube passage. The bile and pancreatic secretions<br>
are discharged from the distal end of the tube into the small intestine.<br>
The foregoing brief description of examples of the invention should not be<br>
used to limit the scope of the present invention. Other examples, features, aspects,<br><br>
embodiments, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art from the following description, which is by way of illustration, one of the<br>
best modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the<br>
invention is capable of other different and obvious aspects, all without departing from<br>
the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions should be regarded as<br>
illustrative in nature and not restrictive.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and<br>
distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better<br>
understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals identify the same<br>
elements and in which:<br>

Fig. 2 depicts an example of diversionary tube with a stent;<br>
Fig. 3 depicts a dissected anatomical view with a Y-stent;<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a dissected anatomical view with a permeable stent; and<br>
Fig. 5 depicts an example of a duodenum stent with diversionary tube.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the human digestive tract, including<br>
a section of the stomach (8) and the small intestine (10). As shown here the small<br>
intestine (10) includes the duodenum (12) and a section of the jejunum (16). Also<br>
shown are sections of the bile duct (22) and pancreatic duct (24), which transport<br>
bile and pancreatic secretions that discharge through the major duodenal papilla (20)<br>
into the duodenum (12). The anatomy of the bile duct (22), pancreatic duct (24) and<br>
major duodenal papilla (20) can vary. In some cases, the bile duct (22) and<br>
pancreatic duct (24) merge together into the hepatopancreatic ampulla (26), a<br>
common duct which opens through the major duodenal papilla (20) into the<br>
duodenum (12). The hepatopancreatic ampulla (26) can vary in length from one<br>
person to the next. In other cases, a person lacks a hepatopancreatic ampulla (26) in<br>
which case the bile duct (22) and pancreatic duct (24) both open directly into the<br>
duodenum (12), typically through the major duodenal papilla (20).<br><br>
In one example of the invention, a diversionary tube (30) is positioned<br>
substantially within the small intestine (10) of a patient. The diversionary tube (30)<br>
comprises a proximal end (32), a distal end (34), and a tube wall having an inner<br>
surface and an outer surface whereby the inner surface defines a passage extending<br>
between the proximal end (32) and distal end (34). In the present example, the<br>
deployed state of the diversionary tube (30) comprises the proximal end (32) being<br>
positioned so as to receive digestive secretions, the distal end (34) being positioned<br>
to discharge the digestive secretions into the small intestine (10), and the passage<br>
being operative to transfer the digestive secretions from the proximal end (32) to the<br>
distal end (34). The tube wall is operative to separate the digestive secretions from<br>
food in the small intestine (10). The digestive secretions continue to flow freely but<br>
digestive contact between the bile and pancreatic secretions and food in the small<br>
intestine (10) is reduced thereby facilitating malabsorption of food nutrients and<br>
reducing caloric uptake to the patient. In addition, because the digestive secretions<br>
flow inside the diversionary tube (30), direct contact is minimized between the<br>
intestine wall and the digestive secretions, which can be irritating or caustic when not<br>
mixed with food.<br>
The diversionary tube (30) will generally be deployed transorally using<br>
endoscopic techniques known in the art, however, the diversionary tube (30) could<br>
be deployed transanally or intrabdominally. The proximal end (32) is anchored using<br>
any one of a variety of different techniques, including without limitation using stents,<br>
sutures, staples, flanges, rings, clips, hooks, adhesives, and the like. As shown here,<br>
the proximal end (32) is anchored on or near the major duodenal papilla (20) and<br>
receives both bile and pancreatic secretions, however, it is also contemplated that<br>
the proximal end (32) could receive only one of the two digestive secretions. Before<br>
or after anchoring the proximal end (32), the distal end (34) is positioned distally in<br>
the small intestine (10). In one embodiment, the distal end (34) is deployed using the<br>
natural peristalsis and movement of food through the small intestine (10) until the<br>
diversionary tube (30) is fully extended in the small intestine (10). The degree of the<br>
malabsorption sought can be controlled by the length of the diversionary tube (30). In<br>
most cases, the distal end (34) will be positioned in the jejunum (16) or the ileum,<br>
however, it is possible the distal end (34) could be positioned in any distal location in<br>
the alimentary tract such as the duodenum (12) or the colon. The diversionary tube<br><br>
(30) length can be relatively long initially to maximize malabsorption, and shortened<br>
during later procedures to tailor a longer-term malabsorption rate.<br>
Nutrient malabsorption can be used for a number of reasons. One such use is<br>
to induce weight loss as a treatment for morbid obesity. An alternative malabsorption<br>
technique is to perform a biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) procedure, which involves<br>
significant surgery to reroute the proximal portion of the small intestine. While the<br>
BPD procedure can successfully diminish the adverse effects of the co-morbidities<br>
associated with morbid obesity and significantly enhance the patient's quality of life,<br>
the treatment is highly invasive and difficult to reverse. In contrast, deployment of the<br>
diversionary tube (30) is minimally invasive and comparatively simple to reverse<br>
while providing the same or similar therapeutic benefits.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an example of a diversionary tube (30). Attached to the<br>
proximal end (32) is a stent (36) for engaging an anatomical lumen through which<br>
digestive secretions flow, such as the bile duct (22), pancreatic duct (24), or<br>
hepatopancreatic ampulla (26). The stent (36)may or may not hold sphincters open<br>
corresponding to the respective anatomical lumens. The stent (36) can take any one<br>
of a variety of configurations known in the art and dimensioned to fit in the desired<br>
anatomical lumen. In addition, the stent (36) can be lined with a sleeve of the same<br>
or different material as the diversionary tube (30). In one example, the stent (36) is<br>
an expanding nitinol stent.<br>
The diversionary tube (30) can be made from any one of a variety of materials<br>
known in the art, including without limitation polytetrafluoroethylene or other<br>
fluropolymers, polyolefins, dacron, latex, silicone, and the like. The diversionary tube<br>
(30) may be made from a homogenous material or from a composite structure. For<br>
instance, the diversionary tube (30) could comprise an isolating layer and a separate<br>
stiffening component so as to prevent crimping or knotting. It is further contemplated<br>
that the diversionary tube (30) could be made; from materials that biodegrade within<br>
a predetermined time so the diversionary tube (30) could be removed through the<br>
normal digestive processes.<br>
The wall of the diversionary tube (30) in the present example is generally<br>
impermeable so as to minimize communication of the digestive secretions with the<br>
food until the secretions are discharged through the distal end (34). It is<br>
contemplated, however, that the diversionary tube (30) wall could be semi-<br>
permeable, for example through pores or perforations, to facilitate a gradual release<br><br>
of the digestive secretions into the small intestine (10). In another example, the<br>
diversionary tube (30) wall is permeable to water so moisture in the small intestine<br>
(10) would hydrate the digestive secretions in the diversionary tube (30) by virtue of<br>
an osmotic gradient and facilitate flow through the diversionary tube (30) passage. In<br>
such example, the diversionary tube (30) wall could be semi-permeable or<br>
impermeable to the digestive secretions.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an embodiment where a Y-stent (40) is connected to the<br>
proximal end (32). The Y-stent (40) includes a biliary portion (42) inserted in the bile<br>
duct (22) and a pancreatic portion (44) inserted in the pancreatic duct (24). The Y-<br>
stent (40) may or may not extend into the hepatopancreatic ampulla (26). The<br>
diversionary tube (30) extends from the Y-stent (40) in the hepatopancreatic ampulla<br>
(26) and into the small intestine (10) through the major duodenal papilla (20).<br>
Accordingly, bile flowing through the bile duct (22) and pancreatic secretions flowing<br>
through the pancreatic duct (24) will enter the proximal end (32) and flow through the<br>
diversionary tube (30).<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an embodiment where a permeable stent (50) is connected to<br>
the proximal end (32). As shown in this example, the permeable stent (50) is partially<br>
lined and is inserted in the bile duct (22) and hepatopancreatic ampulla (26).<br>
Accordingly, bile flowing through the bile duct (22) will enter proximal end (32) of the<br>
diversionary tube (30) through the permeable stent (50). The permeable stent (50)<br>
includes a passage (52) through which pancreatic secretions flowing from the<br>
pancreatic duct (24) pass through the wall of the permeable stent (50) and enter the<br>
proximal end (32) of the diversionary tube (30). The passage (52) may take a variety<br>
of forms, including holes (as shown here), an unlined band in the permeable stent<br>
(50), or the permeable stent (50) being devoid of any lining. Alternative embodiments<br>
include the permeable stent (50) being inserted in the pancreatic duct (24) and<br>
hepatopancreatic ampulla (26), or not inserted in the hepatopancreatic ampulla (26)<br>
at all.<br>
In another variation, the bile and pancreatic secretions are received by two<br>
diversionary tubes that maintain separation between the two digestive secretions.<br>
The diversionary tubes may be co-axial (i.e., one inside the other) or independent.<br>
One advantage of separate diversionary tubes is that the corresponding digestive<br>
secretions can be discharged at different locations along the alimentary tract by<br>
changing the length of the respective diversionary tubes. For instance, one<br><br>
diversionary tube could be long enough to discharge bile into the jejunum while the<br>
other diversionary tube could be long enough to discharge the pancreatic secretions<br>
into the ileum. In yet another variation, only one of the digestive secretions is<br>
diverted. For instance, pancreatic secretions can be channeled in a diversionary tube<br>
while the bile naturally discharges into the duodenum through the major duodenal<br>
papilla (or vice versa).<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment where a duodenum stent (60) (shown here in<br>
a partial cross-section) is deployed in the anatomical lumen of the duodenum (12). In<br>
this example the duodenum stent (60) is flexible, lined, and generally hourglass-<br>
shaped. When deployed the proximal end (64) and distal end (66) substantially<br>
engage the duodenum wall (14) such that food flowing through the duodenum (12)<br>
passes through the duodenum stent (60). An annulus (62) is defined between the<br>
duodenum stent (60) and duodenum wall (14). The duodenum stent (60) is<br>
positioned in the duodenum (12) such the annulus (62) encompasses the major<br>
duodenal papilla (20). Optionally, the annulus (62) may also encompass the minor<br>
duodenal papilla (not shown). The proximal end (32) of the diversionary tube (30)<br>
extends through the distal end (66) and opens into the annulus (62), thus providing<br>
fluid communication between the annulus (62) and distal end (34) of the diversionary<br>
tube (30). Accordingly, digestive secretions will enter the annulus (62) through the<br>
major duodenal papilla (20) and/or minor duodenal papilla, enter the diversionary<br>
tube (30) through the proximal end (32), flow through the diversionary tube (30), and<br>
discharge into the small intestine (10) through the distal end (34). One advantage of<br>
the present embodiment is that it can accommodate a variety of anatomies of the<br>
bile duct (22), pancreatic duct (24) and major duodenal papilla (20). A further<br>
advantage is the device may be deployed without intervening with the pancreatic<br>
anatomy.<br>
Having shown and described various embodiments of the present invention,<br>
further adaptations of the methods and systems described herein can be<br>
accomplished by appropriate modifications by one of ordinary skill in the art without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention. Several of such potential<br>
modifications have been mentioned, and others will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be considered in<br>

: "AN APPARATUS FOR DIVERTING DIGESTIVE SECRETIONS<br>
DISCHARGED INTO A PATIENT'S INTESTINAL TRACT"<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for diverting digestive secretions<br>
discharged into a patient's intestinal tract from at least one of the duodenal<br>
papilla, the apparatus comprising (a) a tubular lined anchor, wherein when the<br>
anchor is deployed, a proximal end and a distal end of the anchor attach to the<br>
duodenum wall proximally and distally respectively about the duodenal papilla,<br>
for the creation of a substantially isolated chamber between an outer surface of<br>
the lined anchor and the duodenum wall, the anchor further comprising an<br>
opening extending through the lined anchor between the proximal end and distal<br>
end of the lined anchor for the passage of digestive secretions from the generally<br>
isolated chamber into the intestinal tract; (b) a diversionary tube comprising a<br>
proximal end in fluid communication with the opening and being operative to<br>
receive digestive secretions discharged therefrom, a distal end which when<br>
deployed is operative to discharge the digestive secretions into the intestinal<br>
tract, and whereby when deployed, the apparatus is operative to transfer the<br>
digestive secretions from the isolated chamber adjacent the anchor to the distal<br>
end of the diversionary tube while exposing a substantial portion of the intestinal<br>
tract about the apparatus to contact with food.</td>
