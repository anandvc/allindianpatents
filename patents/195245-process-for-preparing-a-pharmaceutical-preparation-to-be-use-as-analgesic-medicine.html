				<td>The present invention relates to process for preparing a pharmaceutical preparation to be used as an analgesic medicine for relieving pain in the body.<br>
Many people suffer from the common disease Arthritis whereby they suffer from joint pains.At times the joint pains are so severe that it greatly effects their physical movements.Many persons also suffer from Sciatica pains.Many others suffer from spondylosis and other muscular pains.Persons having stone in the kidney or gall bladder also suffer from bouts of pain which effects greatly their normal life.<br>
It is an object of present invention to provide a pharmaceutical preparation which is very effective as an analgesic preparation for relieving pains in joints and other parts of the human body.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for preparing a pharmaceutical preparation to be used as an Analgesic drug which process comprises mixing Wheat Flour, Suji (component of wheat flour) and Bason(obtained from black grams), the mixture thus prepared is dissolved in water and vigorously stirred,the solution is then kept at a temperature of 27+ 3°c and is kept at the temperature for 16+2 hours,then dried at the temperature of 70-80° c and then ground to a fine powder by any known means.<br>
According to a preffered embodiment of the present invention,the mixture of Wheat Flour,Suji and Bason is dissolved in distilled water,more preferrably double distilled water.<br><br>
According to another preffered embodiment of the invention,the solution of Wheat Flour, Suji and Bason after being kept at temperature of 27+ 3 c for<br>
16+ 2 hours,is heated to a temperature of 90+ 2° c for one hour followed by drying as stated above.<br>
According to another preffered embodiment of the present invention, Wheat Flour, Suji and Bason are mixed in equal quantities.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
The Wheat Flour (1kg), Suji (1kg) and Bason (1kg) are thoroughly mixed in a glass vessel.To the mixture is added 6 litres of double distilled water proper stirring followed by vigorous shaking.The glass vessel is then properly covered and kept in an incubator at 27+ 3° c for 16 hours.After that the cover of the glass vessel is removed and the vessel is shifted to an oven having a temperature of 90+ 2°c and kept at that temperature for one hour. After that the vessel is taken out of the oven and the contents are transferred to 3 mixing glass bowls.The contents are vigorously stirred in the air for 20 minutes.<br>
The bowls are again put in the oven and subjected to drying at a temperature of 70-80° c.It may take 36-40 hours for drying. When the contents are completely dried , the bowls are removed from the oven.The contents are then ground finally in a grinder-mixer.The powder thus obtained is the pharmaceutical Analgesic preparation desired to be prepared.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation thus prepared , according to the present invention, has wonderful medicinal properties for curing joint pains, Sciatica,   Arthritis,   Back pains, Muscular pains and the like.<br><br>
By clinical trials, it was found that when this medicine ( 1 gm to a patient having approx wt. 60kg) was given twice a day for 10 days, followed by once a day for 10 days showed remarkable improvement in joint pains.Relief of pain was noticed just after 1st or 2nd dose.<br>
Further it is also observed that if this medicine is taken for 10 days after every 6 months , it can solve lot of problems associated with joint pains which are associated with age factor, wear &amp; tear of body physique due to abrupt exposure to different temperatures and various other stresses.<br>
For Sciatica Patients : The patients having sciatic pain are given 2 or 3 doses after a gap of 15 minutes each with water. A lot of pain is relieved even no other painkiller is required.Then regular dose of this medicine is taken for      7 days ( 3 times a day,dose lgm for 60kg wt. patient), followed by twice a day for another 7-10 days for the complete recovery from sciatica problems.<br>
For Arthritis : For Arthritis patients this powder is given twice a day for 2-3 months till problem is completely solved.<br>
This medicine is also helpful in solving muscle strains and neck strains like spondylosis.<br>
The persons having old history of joint pains even inflamation are required to take this powder three times a day for longer period for better upkeep &amp; strength of joints,this powder can be taken off &amp; on in old age so as to avoid wear &amp; tear of joints.<br>
It is also observed that this medicine also gives relief to the patients having acute pain due to stones present in the kidney and gall bladder.<br>
Since many apparently different embodiments of the present invention could be made without departing from the scope and spirit thereof, it is intended that the description of the invention stated herein be interpretted as illustrative only and not limiting in any manner what so ever.<br><br><br><br><br>
I   CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for preparmg a pharmaceutical preparation to be used as an<br>
Analgesic medical which process comprises mixing Wheat Flour, Suji (component of wheat flour) and Basoin (obtained from black grams), the mixture thus prepared is dissolved in water and then vigorously stirred, the solution is kept at a temperature of 27+ 3° c      for 16+ 2 hours , then dried at a temperature of 70-80° c and then ground to a fine powder by any known manner.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the mixture of Wheat<br>
flour , Suji and Bason is dissolved in distilled water,preferrably<br>
double distilled water.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claims 1 &amp; 2 wherein the solution of Wheat flour , Suji and Bason in water after being kept at a temperature of 27+ 3° c for 16+2 hours is heated to a temperature of 90+ 2° c for one hour and then dried at a temperature of 70-80° c and then ground to a fine powder.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the Wheat flour,<br>
Suji and Bason are mixed in equal quantity.<br>
5.	The process for preparing a pharmaceutical preparation to be used<br>
as an Analgesic drug substantially as herein described and illustrated<br>
by the example herein.<br><br><br></td>
