				<td>COOLING SYSTEM FOR EQUIPMENT AND NETWORK CABINETS AND METHOD FOR COOLING EQUIPMENT AND NETWORK CABINETS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a cooling system for equipment and network cabinets, particularly server cabinets or racks and to a method for cooling equipment and network cabinets or racks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The ever rising power levels of process computers and servers are linked with constantly rising heat losses. Thus, there are significant power losses in the case of high power processors and servers, particularly compact designs of e.g. one height unit (1HU = 1,75 inch), such as pizzabox and blade servers. The dissipation of the heat quantities released, particularly in the case of data processinq centres, which generally have a relatively large number of server cabinets in one room, is associated with continuously rising capital and operating expenditure nor tne air conditioninq of the room and the cooling of the cabinets and the electronic equipment located therein.<br>
Said electronic equipment, e.g. servers, CPUs and the like are frequently housed in modular form in a standardized enclosure and are generally installed in superimposed manner, but also in juxtaposed manner in an equipment or network cabinet on correspondingly positioned vertical beams. In order to dissipate the heat produced, said electronic modular units are equipped with at least one fan, as well as air inlet and outlet ports, which can be positioned in the side walls or in the front and back of the enclosure.<br>
Cooling surfaces for air cooling cannot: be provided, more particularly in conpact server designs. In addition, the air conditioning systems of air conditioned rooms tor arrangements of cabinets, which are provided with tightly packed modular units and which cur. have heating loads of 10 kW and higher per cabinet, are no longer sufficient to absorb the heat flow.<br><br>
Generally air-cooled server cabinets are provided with perforated doors in order to bring about maximum air permeability. For cooling closed inner spaces of equipment cabinets, it is also known to use air-water heat exchangers (knurr catalogue "Electronic Systems", 07/2002, pp 252 to 254). The known air-water heat exchangers can be fitted to the cabinet cover or to an outer area of a side wall or a rear door or can be provided in slide-in module form, and the cabinet interior temperature can be cooled to below ambient temperature.<br>
A disadvantage is the taking up of the inside space, which is consequently no longer available for equipping with modules. When the air-water heat exchangers are positioned on a side wall, a stringing together of cabinets and a rational utilization of the available installation space are limited. Positioning on the cabinet cover can in the case of a water outflow leads to damage to the electronic modules and the like. In addition, it is not always possible to ensure a uniform cooling of the modules as a result of the air ducting.<br>
US 6,506,111 B2, US 6,652,373 B2, WO 03/005791 A2 and US 6,652,374 B2 disclose server cabinets for superimposed servers, whose heat loss is dissipated by a recycled airflow. An exhaust airflow heated by the servers is supplied with the aid of a ventilator arrangement to a downstream air-water heat exchanger, which is positioned below the cabinet in a base or within the cabinet below the server stack arrangement and passes in the form of cooled supply air, via a supply air duct, to the servers.<br>
An improvement of the heat dissipation is to be brought about by at least one air distributing device, which is located more particularly in the supply air duct, but can also be provided in the exhaust air duct or Tn both the supply and exhaust air ducts. The air distributing device is intended to ensure that a predeterminable airflow proportion can be supplied to the individual servers. Essentially it is a plate, which extends over the server stack arrangement and is provided with air passage openings, which are formed in horizontal rows in complimentary manner to the gaps between the servers. In order to supply a virtually identical air quantity to all the servers over the cabinet height, close to the cabinet base or the heat exchanger the air distributing plate has few or no air passage openings and in an upper area has several rows of air passage openings placed over the entire width.<br>
In an alternative construction, a virtually identical air supply to the servers is to be obtained by rr.eans of an air distributing plate, which is arranged in inclimanner in the supply air duct, so that the cross section of the latter decreases upwards. The air distributer plate is more particularly fixed to the front, door of the cabinet and the inclined position<br><br>
can be varied with the aid of a hinge at the lower end and fastening clip9 with elongated holes at the upper end.<br>
The known heat dissipation system requires additional costs for design, manufacture and installation of the at least one air distributing device. In addition, the sought homogeneous air supply and uniform heat dissipation cannot be guaranteed to the necessary extent as a result of the air ducting.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a cooling system for equipment and network cabinets, particularly server cabinet and a method for cooling such cabinets and the modules located therein, particularly servers, which with the necessary" certainty is able to ensure the necessary cooling capacity for tightly packed cabinets and cabinet arrangements, particularly for high power servers, using extremely simple means and involving particularly low capital and operating expenditure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to the cooling system, the object according to the invention is achieved by a cooling system for equipment and network cabinets or racks comprising a sealed inner space in which are located electronic modules, a closed cooling air circuit ror dissipating the heat loss ot the electronic modules and an air-water heat exchanger for cooling the heated cooling air circuit exhaust air, which is located in a lower area of the cabinet and connected to a supply air duct and exhaust air duct, wherein there is an air Sucting with equally long air flow part and therefore equal flow resistances for the individual modules and an air separation between the cold supply air and heated exhaust air and wherein the individual modules can be supplied with cold supply air at a uniform supply air temperature.<br>
With respect to the cooling method, the object according to the invention is achieved by a method for cooling equipment and network cabinets or racks and electronic modules located theirin in which an air flow travels in closed circuit form, cold supply air being supplied to the electronic modules and heated exhaust air is cooled in an air-water heat exchanger, wherein the cold supply air the cold supply air is air-technically separated from the heated exhaust air, the cold supply air is supplied and the heated exhaust air is removed in equally long airflow paths and therefore with equal flow resistances with respect to the individual electronic modules and wherein cold supply air with a uniform air temperature is supplied to the electronic modules.<br>
The cooling system according to the invention is based on a closed cooling air circuit in a substantially airtight network or equipment cabinet and an air water heat exchanger allowing the dissipation of all the power less. The<br><br>
air-water heat exchanger is placed in a lower area of the cabinet and is advantageously connected to the cold water supply of the building.<br>
According to a fundamental principle of the invention, the cooling system has an air ducting with equally long airflow paths and therefore identical flow resistances for the individual electronic" modules in the interior of the cabinet (Tichlmann principle). Therefore the superimposed and/or juxtaposed, individual modules can be supplied with supply air at a uniform temperature. The uniform supply air temperature is preferably assisted by a correspondingly high flow rate. The term uniform supply air temperature is understood to mean a temperature tolerance of approximately ±2° Kelvin.<br>
According to the invention there is an air separation between the cold supply air and the heated exhaust air.<br>
The in principle airtight network cabinet can e.g. be virtually completely sealed with respect to the environment. As a result of the sealing provided, it is possible to prevent an air exchange between the substantially sealed cabinet interior and the installation space, where generally several such cabinets are installed and consequently the demands with respect to air conditioning leading to significant costs are obviated.<br>
The supply air is cold or cooled air from the air-water heat exchanger in the lower area of the cabinet. This supply air is supplied by means of a supply air duct of the cabinet and which can extend over the entire cabinet height, but which is at least provided over the vertical array of the modules, to the said modules and the gaps between the modules.<br>
The module enclosures are appropriately provided with air inlet ports, which are connected to the supply air duct. The cooled supply air passes through the air inlet ports into the modules, is heated by the heat loss absorbed and passes via air outlet ports, which are preferably formed in an enclosure wall parallel to the air inlet ports, to an exhaust air duct.<br>
The modules can contain at least one fan, which e.g. sucks in the cold supply air through the air inlet port and feeds it through the air outlet port into the exhaust air duct. However, even without fans, the air ducting according to the invention ensures a uniform cooling of the modules. Thus, the cooling system according to the invention has the advantage that the modules can be cooled to the necessary extent without fans.<br>
The exhaust air auct 13 constructed in split manner for implementing the equal length airflow paths for all r.he modules and identical air resistances ar.d has a first duct section and a second, following duct section. The first<br><br>
duct section is constructed as a manifold or collecting duct and receives the heated exhaust air passing out of the air outlet ports of the modules.<br>
Advantageously the collecting duct can be formed at least by the space downstream of the modules and which is generally used for cable running purposes. In the collecting duct the exhaust airflows of the individual modules are collected in a rising exhaust airflow with the aid of at least one ventilator, passed upwards, reversed and in the second duct section in a parallel, falling exhaust airflow are supplied to the air-water heat exchanger located in a lower cabinet area.<br>
It is advantageous to be able to provide at least two or n+1 redundant, high power ventilators in the upper cabinet area in order to ensure the inventive air ducting of the closed cooling air circuit.<br>
Appropriately the ventilators are juxtaposed and the falling duct section is split with the aid of a vertical separating element, e.g. a separating web into individual exhaust air duct sections, e.g. into a right-hand and left-hand exhaust air duct section. This prevents a return flow if one ventilator fails.<br>
In a preferred construction, the ventilators and the second duct section for the falling exhaust airflow are integrated in a door, particularly in the rear door.<br>
The arrangement of the supply air duct and exhaust air duct being composed of the first and second duct sections takes place corresponding to the air ducting in the modules. Generally there is a front suction of the cooled supply air and rear exhaust airflow of the heated exhaust air. Correspondingly the supply air duct is constructed at the front and the split exhaust air duct at the rear of the rack and the ventilators and the second duct section of the exhaust air duct is arranged in a rear door.<br>
It falls within the scope of the invention to reverse the supply air duct and exhaust air duct or to place the same in the area of the side walls.<br>
The air-technical separation of the cold supply air from the heated exhaust air, which contributes to obtaining the sought high power cooling, can advantageously be achieved with partitions, which are positioned between the modules and the cabinet walls and/or with blind plates in the front area of the modules. Then a supply of cold air solely to the modules and their horizontal gaps is ensured.<br><br>
To maintain the air circulation and the control loop in the case of a fault, i.e. if all the modules fail, advantageously there is a planned interruption or "leak" particularly in the upper cabinet area.<br>
Use can advantageously be made of a per se known air-water heat exchanger, which is correspondingly dimensioned and can e.g. extend over the entire width and/or depth of the cabinet. In order to be able to receive the exhaust air forced downwards in the second duct section, to cool and to supply it as cooled supply air to the supply air duct, it is appropriate to construct the lower exhaust air openings of the second duct section in complementary manner to the inlet openings of the air-water heat exchanger and provide a corresponding sealing.<br>
It is advantageous that the air-water heat exchanger can be positioned within the cabinet and can e.g. occupy the bottom six height units (HU) . Then short cold water pipe paths are necessary for connection to the cold water supplying of the building. The lower arrangement is also advantageous with respect to the safety of the electronic modules and further electrical and electronic equipment and components positioned in the cabinet interior, in the case of any leak in the cold water system. Any water which flows out cannot reach the array of the electrical modules above the air-water heat exchanger, so that the necessary safety is ensured.<br>
The air-water heat exchanger is appropriately designed in accordance with the necessary cooling capacity. In the case of a 20 kW cooling capacity, it is e.g. possible to provide as quantity flows 1 1/s cold water and 4 000 m3/h circulated cooling air. It is also advantageous to design the advance and return of the cold water of the air-water heat exchanger in such a way that there is no drop below the dew point, so that condensate formation in the cabinet can be prevented.<br>
Appropriately DC ventilators are provided in n+1 redundancy. If these ventilators are constructed in temperature-dependent, speed-controlled and alarm-monitored manner, by means of this control and software the temperature-speed characteristic can be adapted to the actual maximum power loss of the modules, e.g. servers.<br>
A variable volume flow is used for adapting the heat dissipating power of the cabinet to the actual power loss of the modules or servers, which can vary as a function of the computing power and capacity utilization.<br>
It is also appropriate to install a cabinet monitoring system to which can be inter alia connected a smoke detector, door contact switch, moisture sensor, water detector and speed control. With the aid of temperature sensors it is also possible to monitor the temperature of supply air supplied to the<br><br>
modules, and on exceeding freely programmable desired values it is possible to trigger off different alarm stages (non-urgent, urgent) and automatically interrupt the AC power supply of the modules in the case of a thermal risk.<br>
Appropriately in the case of an opening of the rear door the ventilators are automatically switched off. These return to operation when the rear door is closed.<br>
Advantageously the cabinet is equipped with its own n+1 redundant DC power supply for the ventilators. By means of an AC distribution the socket boards are protected and switched for the AC supply of modules, particularly servers.<br>
According to the method of the invention, the individual modules, which are juxtaposed and/or superimposed in a substantially airtight equipment and network cabinet or rack and which are cooled with an airflow in closed circuit form, are supplied with cold supply air in equally long airflow paths and therefore identical or equal flow resistances, as well as with a uniform supply air temperature, and the cold supply air is air-technically separated from the heated exhaust air.<br>
Appropriately the air ducted in a supply air duct and exhaust air duct in the substantially airtight cabinet is circulated at a relatively high speed. For this purpose preferable n+1 redundant, high power ventilators are positioned in a clearly defined manner in rising and downstream falling exhaust airflow.<br>
The airflow is cooled with the aid of an air-water heat exchanger located in a lower cabinet area. The supply airflow cooled in said air-water heat exchanger is supplied to the individual modules, e.g. through their air inlet ports, absorbs the heat loss produced in the modules and passes with the aid of the downstream ventilators into the exhaust air duct.<br>
Appropriately the exhaust air duct has a split construction in order to implement the Tichlmann principle, i.e. uniform or identical flow paths and uniform or identical flow resistances. In a collecting duct the exhaust air of the individual modules is initially supplied in a rising exhaust air flow. Due to the fact that the exhaust air in said rising flow follows the thermal lift, advantageously an improved energy balance is obtained. Following a reversal of the rising exhaust airflow, the exhaust air is subject to a falling flow and supplied to the air-water heat exchanger in the lower cabinet area.<br>
On grounds of the relatively high flow rate, the air ducting concept and the air separation of the supply/exhaust airflow, in conjunction with the lower<br><br>
air-water heat exchanger, an efficient cooling of the modules is brought about.<br>
For the air-technical separation of the cold supply air and the heated exhaust air, advantageously in addition to vertical separating elements between the juxtaposed and/or superimposed modules, blind plates are located at the positions left free.<br>
In order to maintain an air circulation and the control loop, the air separation between the cold supply air and heated exhaust air is interrupted in planned manner and e.g. a free space is provided in an upper cabinet area.<br>
The cooling system for network cabinets, particularly server cabinets according to the invention, with relatively low capital and operating expenditure permits high power cooling, particularly for cabinets in commercial data processing centres, e.g. in the banking and industrial sectors, but also in the scientific sector and in the case of computer clusters, which e.g. can have up to 100 cabinets, each of 10 kW. It is in • particular possible to create in stepped manner water-cooled server cabinets up to e.g. 20 kW and higher cooling capacity in e.g. 2.5 kW steps and to ensure in said cabinets a uniform cooling air supply of all the servers, quite independently of the installation position within the cabinet. The installation of fans in the modules is not absolutely necessary, because the cooling concept according to the invention ensures uniform cooling of the individual modules even without fans.<br>
An overheating and failure of the servers and the associated significant costs are avoided and high availability ensured.<br>
A further advantage is the independence of the inventive cabinet cooling system from the ambient air. This enables a large number of cabinets to be installed in a room and fully assembled cabinets can be installed relatively close together, so that a significant room area saving can be achieved compared with conventional air conditioning. It is also advantageous that in data processing centres with conventional air conditioning, individual cabinets, which have a comparatively high heat loss, can be equipped with the cooling system according to the invention. The air conditioning of the room can then be adapted in cost-saving manner to the lower heat loss of the remaining cabinets.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter relative to the attached highly diagrammatic drawings, wherein show:<br><br>
Fig- 1 A longitudinal section through a network cabinet with a cooling system according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 A cross-section through the network cabinet according to fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an equipment or network cabinet 2 with a virtually sealed inner-space 18 and superimposed electronic modules 3. In this embodiment the equipment and network cabinet 2 is a server cabinet and the electronic modules 3 are servers 4 having e.g. one height unit (1 HU = 1.75 inch) . The air ducting 5 in the area of the servers 4 is illustrated by arrows (fig. 2) . In this embodiment within the enclosure of the servers 4 is in each case provided a fan 6, which implements an air ducting 5, as follows: supply air 8 is sucked in via front air inlet ports (not shown), ducted around the heat loss-producing, electronic components (not shown) and supplied to an exhaust air duct 15 through rear air outlet ports (not shown).<br>
Below the servers 4 is provided an air-water heat exchanger 7, which is connected to the cold water supply of the building and which can e.g. require 6 HU of the cabinet 2. Thus, in the case of a server cabinet having 46 HU, 40 HU are available for the servers 4.<br>
The air-water heat exchanger 7 can e.g. be operated with a cold water quantity of 1 1/s and a supply air temperature of approximately 12°C, so that exhaust air 10, 11 travelling in closed circuit form and heated to approximately 35°C, can be cooled to approximately 20 to 25°C. The air cooled in the air-water heat exchanger 7 is supplied as supply air 8 to a supply air duct 9, which is connected to the not shown air inlet ports of the servers 4.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the air-technical separation between the cold supply air 8 and the heated exhaust air in the exhaust air duct 15. Air separation takes place in the front area of the network cabinet 2 with the aid of partitions 12, which are constructed as bent plates and positioned vertically. The supply air duct 9 is bounded by the partitions 12, a tightly closing front door 13 and the enclosure fronts 14 of the servers 4.<br>
According to fig. 1 all the existing HU of the cabinet 2 above the air-water heat exchanger 7 are occupied with servers 4, so that there is no need for blind plates for unoccupied HU.<br>
The exhaust air 10, 11 passes into an exhaust air duct 15, which has a first duct section, constructed as a manifold or collecting duct 16, fox a rising exhaust airflow 10 and a second duct section 17 for a falling exhaust airflow 11.<br><br>
The second duct section 17 for the falling exhaust airflow 11 is constructed on a rear door 20, which is provided with an inside door cover 19, a vertical separating web 26 and two ventilators 21 for the suction of the exhaust air 10 from the collecting duct 16. The ventilators 21 are juxtaposed at the same height in the upper area and the reversed exhaust air 11 is supplied to a right and left-hand duct 17.1, 17.2 associated with each ventilator 21, and fed through lower exhaust air openings 22 to the air-water heat exchanger 7.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the collecting duct 16 for the heated exhaust air 10 can be constructed not only behind the servers 4, but also laterally thereof in the vicinity of the side walls 24, 25 of the cabinet 2, if the air separation of supply air and exhaust air is advantageously carried out in the front area of the cabinet 2.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the equally long airflow paths and equal flow resistances, independently of the installation height of the servers 4, as a result of the arrangement of the air-water heat exchanger 7 below the servers 4 and as a result of the air ducting, particularly in the rising and falling duct sections 16, 17 of the exhaust air duct 15. With the aid of the rising and falling exhaust air 10, 11 in the split exhaust air duct 15, the direct application of the heated exhaust air of the individual servers 4 to the air-water heat exchanger 7 is prevented.<br>
A small, planned interruption 23 of the air separation between the cold or cooled supply air 8 and the heated exhaust air 10 is create for maintaining the circulation of the airflow and therefore for maintaining the control loop, even in the case of a failure of the modules or servers. This planned interruption or "leak" 23 is provided in an upper area of the cabinet 2, particularly above the modules 3.<br><br>
