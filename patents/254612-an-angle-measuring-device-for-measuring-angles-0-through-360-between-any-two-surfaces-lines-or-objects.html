Description<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The invention relates to the precise measurement of angle in any plane, with resolution of 0.1 arcsecond, by mechanical means. It uses compound gears, a set of worm and worm wheel, the whole assembly being mounted on a stand / tripod, to take measurements. The measurement device can be adapted for rapid reading of angular measurement, e.g. taper angles of jobs on lathes and other machines, structures and laboratory calibrations in any industry.<br>
Civil survey work, navigation and astronomical work needs high precision of angular measurement to find distance between objects. The instrument of the present invention can serve as high precision Theodolite or as high precision calibration tool/equipment in place of autocollimators and angle dekkor.<br>
The instrument of the present invention also surpasses instruments like sine bars, clinometers of all kinds, angle gauges and Vernier bevel protractors, in terms of ease of operation, setup time, precision, versatility and instrument least count combined.<br><br><br>
In Civil construction work, with a telescope mounted on this instrument, the device serves as a high precision Theodolite, used in survey work. Telescope swivelled in the vertical plane gives angular readings in the vertical plane, to measure heights. Similarly, turning in the horizontal plane gives angles between objects in the horizontal plane. Readings can be taken in inclined planes as well.<br>
The said instrument serves as high precision navigational and astronomical tool, where accurate angular measurements are needed to find distances between objects.<br>
The instrument can serve as a high precision calibration tool in place of costly tools and difficult set ups such as in Autocollimator, Angle Dekkor and the low resolution instruments such as Sine Bars, Clinometers (with and without micrometers), Angle Gauges, Vernier Bevel protractor.<br><br><br>
State of the art in the field<br>
References: U.S. Pat. No.5905592; US Patent No. 5317810; US Patent No. Des.413074; British patent No. 159, 002; British patent No. 559,748.<br>
Various instruments and instrumental techniques are known in the art for the purpose of civil survey work and precise measurement of distance and angles between objects. Some of these are purely mechanical, whereas others involve combination of mechanical and electronics principles, which essentially makes them costly.<br>
Instruments known in the prior art involve Theodolite (U.S. Pat. No.5905592), Sextants (US Patent No. Des.413074), Clinometers (US Patent No. 5317810), angle gauges (British patent No. 159, 002; British patent No. 559,748), Vernier Bevel Protractors and Sine Bars used with slip gauges.<br>
In accordance with the operational principles of such equipments, it is generally known that following limitations restrict the use of the respective instruments. E.g.<br>
• As calibration instruments, Autocollimator and Angle Dekkor, have accuracy of 0.1 arcsecond, but nevertheless, the cost is high, setups required are complex and the range of values of angles which can be measured are small. The measuring instrument of the present invention<br><br><br>
has measuring range of full circle, i.e. 360° with same resolution of 0.1 arcsecond.<br>
•	Sine Bars cannot be used for angles more than 45°, to be used with Dial gauges and slip gauges. Set up required involves complex calculations and procedures and an electronic calculator to work out the reading.<br>
•	Clinometers are unable to give reading in planes other than the vertical plane and they use a micrometer for giving resolution of 1 arcminute. The measuring instrument of the present invention can give readings in any plane.<br>
•	Mechanical and Optical Theodolites, transits have lower resolution of 1 arcminute.<br>
•	Vernier Bevel Protractor has low resolution of 5 arcminutes.<br><br><br>
Object of the invention (Problem &amp; Solution)<br>
It is known in the art of design and fabrication of angular measurement devices that with increase in precision, cost of instruments goes up. In additions, tedious procedures and intricate setups are involved in instruments such as Autocollimators. A device using gears for magnification of the scale is developed for easy operation, low cost and minimum set up aids and accessories.<br>
Thus, the main objective of the invention is to provide a universal angle-measuring instrument covering 360° which is used to measure angles of jobs with features, such as tapers, included angles between surfaces or objects in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, navigational sciences.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to provide a method for rapid measurement of angles, with higher accuracies and ease of operation.<br>
Thus according to the present invention, there is provided a very cost effective instrument, for such measurement purpose by avoiding use of complicated electronic and other parts.<br><br><br>
Statement of invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an angle measuring instrument, consisting of a Worm, Worm Wheel and a set of gears, which can be used for measurement of angles, in inclined, horizontal and vertical planes in a rapid manner, by movement of the hand wheel co-axial with the worm shaft. The magnification is done by means of a mechanical gear train. Direct reading of the order of 0.1 arcsecond mechanically, without the use of collimators, electronic components, Vernier Scales or micrometers, used in other precision devices, is possible.<br>
A mechanism to release worm from wormwheel is designed to allow absolute and incremental readings to be taken in any plane.<br>
Further there is provided a method for performing the steps in angular measurement for both mechanical, navigational and survey work. A method for setting up horizontal and vertical references is also provided for use of this instrument.<br><br><br>
Summary of invention<br>
The embodiment of the present invention provides a device and methods of angular measurement, in a versatile form for use in survey work, metrology, navigation, calibration, astronomy and in mechanical engineering applications. Measurement of the order of 0.1 arcsecond is possible by using gears, without other costly parts such as Optical, collimated lenses, PLCs and electronics. Moreover, turning of the device is possible to cover 360 degrees, to get rapid and direct readings on a calibrated and a supplementary graduated dial.<br>
The instrument can be mounted on a Theodolite or a camera stand commonly used, for survey work. For mechanical measurements, a stand with a means to move in vertical and horizontal planes, serves the purpose.<br><br><br>
Detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings:<br>
Figure 1, shows the assembly of unit, mounted on a stand, as used in survey work, navigational work.<br>
Figure 2, shows the details of the unit as used in mechanical type measurements. Figure 3, shows the turret assembly with adapter to attach a magnetic compass.<br>
The various parts as shown in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 are: Survey or Camera Stand (1), Turret (2), Central Bearing (3), Worm Wheel (4), Worm with Worm Shaft (5), Handwheel (6), Gear Box (7), Calibrated dial (8), 360° Graduated Scale (9), Reference Scale (10), Rotary Scale (II), Worm releasing mechanism (12), Adapter (13), Magnetic Compass (14). Theodolite type telescope(15), Bracket for Telescope (16), Plug (17)<br>
The device of the present invention can be mounted on survey stand or a commercially available camera stand for survey work. Advantage of using a camera stand is that an integral bubble type level indicator is readily available, for the purpose of levelling and the Anglometer can be raised or lowered to suitable heights.<br>
According to the methods of this invention, for survey work and other such observations, initial setting is done by freely rotating the Worm wheel (4) on which the telescope (15) is mounted, by releasing the worm from it. Crosshair in the lenses of the telescope provides vertical and horizontal reference lines for<br><br><br>
alignment with objects of reference. Any angle "theta" can be measured by engaging the worm with worm wheel, and turning the Handwheel in clockwise or anticlockwise direction, till the crosshair is aligned with the second object.<br>
In case, magnetic North is to be set as reference, a detachable Adaptor (13) is placed on top of the Plug (17). A magnetic compass is then placed at the center with the help of this adaptor. Camera Stands enable us to tilt the base of the device to any angle till it is vertical.<br>
On turning the Handwheel, it is observed that the worm wheel rotates, with the telescope. The worm shaft coupled to the gear box in turn, has direct relationship to the gears in the gear box. Compound gears are used to get desired magnification in "degrees", "arcminutes" and "arcseconds" on Calibrated scale (8). Three types of divisions are marked on Calibrated dial (8) to take readings:<br>
1.	Fine divisions for arcseconds measurement<br>
2.	Medium divisions show the arcminutes.<br>
3.	Dark and long divisions are used to measure the degrees.<br>
All the Gears in Gear Box are having Cycloidal profile to take advantage of characteristics of these gears. For every revolution of the worm shaft, the arcseconds pointer turns through 60 revolutions which implies, it covers 3600 arcseconds, which can further be read as 1/10th arcseconds by having scale lines of arcseconds into 10 more parts. The gear ratio is 1: 60 for arc seconds.<br><br><br>
For every revolution of the worm shaft, the minutes hand turns through 1 revolution and covers 60 arcminutes, i.e. the gear ratio is 1:1. for arcminutes with respect to the worm<br>
The Gear Ratio for "Degrees" Gear is 1: 0.083334, with respect to the worm, and covers 1/12th of a full circle on a Calibrated Scale (8). It implies that in one full turn of the "degrees" pointer, it shows only 12°<br>
For mechanical type readings, a fixed reference scale (10), attached to the Graduated scale (9), is used for zero setting. As the zero can be set at any position, absolute as well as incremental readings can be easily taken.<br>
The following procedures are illustrative and make clear objectives and advantages of the present invention and also describe the use of this instrument in different kinds of measurements. However it is to be understood that such examples are not to be construed in a restricted manner in the scope of this invention.<br>
Ex. 1: For survey work (in place of Theodolite):<br>
- The assembly is mounted on commercially available stand. This stand can be made horizontal, inclined or vertical. Plumb line of the instrument can be fixed by using laser or mechanical plumbs commonly available.<br><br><br>
-	An adaptor connects a magnetic compass to the instrument turret, to<br>
fix north position, for noting readings with respect to the magnetic<br>
North direction,<br>
Releasing the worm shaft from the worm wheel does the zero setting. A Theodolite type Telescope (16) is mounted on the worm wheel. Telescope moves with the worm wheel on rotation of the hand wheel. Graduated scale (9), gives readings in "degrees", which is also shown on the dial attached to gearbox.<br>
Calibrated scale (8) attached to one end worm shaft, gives readings in "arcminutes" and "arcseconds" and also in "degrees". The degree pointer covers 12° only for one complete revolution on the calibrated dial. This pointer is supplementary, as another pointer attached to the rotary scale (11), gives the "degrees" reading as well. For reading in inclined and vertical planes, the base is tilted at required angle. This angle is also measurable by having a protractor attached to the tilting base on the stand.<br>
Additional steps given below are to be followed:<br>
-	Positioning the Magnetic North with the help of magnetic compass<br>
placed above the Worm wheel, if required.<br>
Fixing telescope above the Worm wheel and rotating it with the help of hand wheel about the centre, till the target is aligned with a cross hair of the telescope<br><br><br>
Noting the "degrees" readings directly above the said worm wheel, on<br>
a Graduated scale (9).<br>
"Degrees", "Minutes" and "Arcseconds" and fractions thereof, are also<br>
shown in the Calibrated Dial (8).<br>
In the vertical plane, a plumb weight attached to the Zero Reference<br>
Scale (10) sets it to perfect vertical alignment, so that it can also be<br>
taken as perfect horizontal reference.<br>
Ex. 2: Measurement for metrology applications:<br>
Turret holds a fixed extendable reference scale for initial zero setting<br>
placed above the Graduated Scale (9)<br>
Zero setting is done using worm shaft releasing mechanism (12), at<br>
any position of the worm wheel.<br>
Rotary Scale (11) points to the degrees moved on Graduated Scale.<br>
Required angle is turned through with the help of Hand wheel (6) and<br>
the readings are noted<br>
Ex. 3: Measurement for machining operations:<br>
Stop machine, for noting reading.<br>
Bring instrument above the job where taper is to be measured -    Set Zero for reference, by releasing the worm shaft from worm wheel.<br><br><br>
Slide the rotary scale (11) and rotate it till it is aligned for taper measurement. The "degrees" readings are shown, on a graduated dial<br>
(9).<br>
"Degrees", "Minutes" and "Arcseconds" are also shown in the<br>
calibrated Dial (8), in the transverse direction of the said worm shaft.<br>
The cumulative backlash errors in all gears can be reduced to zero by using hairspring, as used in dial gauges. Pitch of the worm and the worm wheel has to be exact for the device to give error free readings.<br><br><br>
Scope and/or ambit of the invention<br>
The measuring instrument of the present invention, primarily finds use<br>
in metrological applications wherein high accuracy of measurement is required. The mounting base is simple in design. The mounting base could be any type of fixture that rigidly secures the unit. A tripod stand used for Theodolites/transits or a Camera stand serves as a mounting base in survey work. To take readings in inclined planes, a commercially available plastic protractor can be attached to base frame the unit at the hinge point on the stand, to find the inclination of measuring plane.<br>
In mechanical engineering applications, a stand mounted on a carriage of a lathe, or a vice can hold the basic unit for measurement. Parallelogram type sliding scales, like those used in combination sets help rotating scales to be extended for jobs with intricate shapes Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that such modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined.<br><br><br>
