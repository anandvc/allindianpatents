Held of the Invention The present invention relates to novel indolinone derivatives useful as pharmaceuticals, to processes for preparing the compounds, to intemaediates useful in the preparation of the compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the. compounds, and to the use cif the compounds as pharmaceuticals.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
WO 96/40116 disclose that certain pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone derivatives are receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors useful in the treatment of conditions responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for example proliferative disorders such as cancer. A preferred compound, disclosed on page 17, is 3-C2,3-dimethylpyrrol-5-yl)methylene]-2-indolinone, also known as SU5416. Unfortunately, this compound has been found to exhibit poor solubility in water and low bioavailability upon oral and intravenous administration.<br>
WO 99/61422 discloses further pvrrole substituted 2-indolinone derivatives as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A preferred compound, disclosed as compound 5 on page 214, is 3-[2,4-dimethyl-5-(2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-lH-pyrrol-3-yl]propiomc acid, also known as SU6668. This compound has been found to possess superior oral activity to SU5416, but has been reported to lack die ability of that -eempound-to-inhibit the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt-3 (Abstract 497, Anne-Marie O'Farrell et al., America Society of Hematology Meeting, Orlando, Florida, USA, December 7-11,2001). Flt-3 is an important target for a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, especially for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), because about 30% of AML patients have been found to possess mutant forms of Flt-3 which lead to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt-3 (Levis et al., Blood, 1 August, 2001, Vol. 98. No. 3, pp 885-887).<br><br>
wo 01/60814 discloses pyrrole substituted 2-indo!inone derivatives bearing certain amido substituents directly attached to the pyrrole ring as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.<br>
WO 02/055517 discloses indoiinones substituted with aryl substituents at the 4 position which exhibit protein kinase modulating ability.<br>
WO 01/42243 discloses that certain compounds containing two or more pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone groups covalently linked together through the 3 position on each pyrrole by one or more linker groups are also useful as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.<br>
Nonetheless, in view of the severity of conditions responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and of the recent identification of specific kinase inhibitor targets, a need exists for new receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors withdiverse properties.<br><br><br>

When used as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention will usually be administered in a pharmaceutical composition. The compositions comprise a compound of the invention as the active mgredient, together with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier. The compositions may be formulated for any route of administration, in particular for oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal administration. The compositions may be formulated in any conventional form, for example, as tablets, capsules, solutions, suspensions, dispersions, syrups, sprays, gels, suppositories, patches and emulsions.<br>
The preparation of a suitable pharmaceutical composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, the ingredients for such compositions are commercially available &amp;om, for example, Sigma (SL Louis, MO). By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20* Edition, Uppincott Williams &amp; White, Baltunore, MD (2000); and H. C. Ansel et al.. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7* Edition, Uppincott Williams &amp; White. Baltimore, MD (1999).<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for oral admmistration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, tablet, pills, lozenges, cachets, dragees, powders, granules, or as a solution or suspension in a liquid, and the like; each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid compositions. Exanq)les of such carriers<br><br>
include magnesiimi stearMe. starch, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose and binders, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone. In addition, the active compound can be formulated in a controlled release dosage form as a tablet comprising a hydrophiiic or hydrophobic matrix.<br>
A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation procedures, for example, by incorporation of active compound and excipients into a hard gelatin capsule. Alternatively, a semi-solid matrix of active compound and high molecular weight polyethylene glycol can be prepared and filled into a hard gelatin capsule; or a solution of active compound in polyethylene glycol or a suspension in edible oil, can be prepared and filled into a soft gelatin c^sule.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention can be formulated for injection, for example for intravenous injection. A typical composition for intravenous injection consists of a sterile isotonic aqueous solution containing, for example, active compound and dextrose or sodium chloride, or a mixture of dextrose and sodium chloride. Other examples of suitable excipients include lactated Ringer's injection, lactated Ringer's plus dextrose injection, Normosol-M and dextrose, Isolyte E, acylated Ringer's injection, and the like. Optionally, a co-solvent, for example, polyethylene glycol; a chelating agent, for example, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid; a stabilizing agent, for example, a cyclodextrin; and an anti-oxidant, for example, sodium metabisulpbite, may be included in the formulation.<br>

According to yet another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of a condition responsive to a tj^rosine kinase inhibitor, which comprises a. con:^)OU^d of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating a condition responsive to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which comprises administering to a patient in need of<br><br>
treatment an effective amount of a con^und of formula (I) or a phaimaceulicaliy-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The patient may be, for example, a mammal, such as a companion animal, and is preferably a human.<br>
The dose (or effective amount) of the compound administered to a patient will depend upon many factors, including the particular compound used, the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the species of the patient, the weight of the patient and the route of administration. In general, a dose in the range of from O.OI to lOOjlM/kg of bodyweight will be administered.<br><br><br><br><br>

Ca^* Release Assay (FLIPR Assay)<br>
The binding of growth factors to tiieir respective receptors leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptor. This is the first step in a signaling cascade that results in the release of Ca2+ fiom internal stores and influx of extracellular Ca2+.<br>
The rise in intracelluar Ca^^ is quantitated by loading cells with a fluorescent dye prior to stimulation with the growth factor and by subsequently assessing the fluorescent signal in a Huorometric Image Plate Reader (FliPR). A kinase inhibitor that can penetrate the cell membrane inhibits receptor autophosphorylation, hence, the Ca2+ release is reduced or ablated-<br>
ia order to determine the IC50 of test compounds against the VEGFR in the FUPR assay, HUVECs (WalkersviUe, MD) were used. For the determination of ICaiS against the PDGFR, a HEK cell line were used that expresses the human PDGFR. 40-50000 cells per well were plated in a 96 well plate. The cells were incubated for 3-4 hours to adhere to the<br><br>
plate. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice in FLIPR buffer (IXHBS, 2mM CaCl, lOmM HEPES. pH7.4, 2.5 mM Probenecid, 0.1% BSA). After the second wash 50 ^iL of the Ca2+ sensitive dye FLUO-3 (FLUO-3 (AM) TEF Labs, 50^,g in lOmL FUPR buffer) was added to the remaining 50|iL buffer in each well. After loading the cells for one hour, the cells were washed twice and the test compounds were added in 50 pL as a 2X solution to the 50 yL of buffer in each well. The cells were incubated with the compounds for 30 minutes and then VEGF (40 ng/mL, BioSource International) for the VEGFR or PDGF (40 ng/mL, BioSource International) for the PDGFR was added. The change in fluorescence intensity was measured in a Fluorometric Image Plate Reader (FLIPR) (Molecular Devices).<br>
Proliferation and Viability Assay (MTT)<br>
The inhibition of mutant FIt-3 ITD is expected to affect the proliferation and viability of AML cells with this mutation. In order to assess the activity of test compounds an MTT proliferation and viability assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was performed with an AML cell line called MV4-11. MV4-11 cells express Flt-3 ITD. 50,000 cells per well in 100 \iL of media were plated in a 96 well plate and were incubated with increasing concentrations of compound for 48 hours. After this incubation period, 10 |xL of the MTT labeling reaction was added for 4 hours. The MTT labeling reagent was metabolized by viable cells to fonnazan, an insoluble blue salt. To solubilize the formazan salt, 100 \LL of solubilization solution was added. The plate was incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours and, then, the optical density of the wells was determined spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. The optical density of the solutions in the wells reflects the effect the compound has on the viability of the cells.<br>
Immunoprecipitation/ Western (IP/Western)<br>
The binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases like Flt-3 or PDGFR leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptors. The inhibition of autophosphorylation is the objective pursued with kinase inhibitors. By performing an EP/Westem experiment the level of receptor autophosphorylation can be assessed directly.<br>
5x10* cells (HEK PDGFR cell line for PDGFR, HEK c-Kit for c-Kit, and THP-1. HL-60 or MV4-11 for Flt-3) were incubated for 30 minutes in 2.5 mL of culture media with a defined concentration of test compound. In order to stimulate receptor<br><br>
autophosphorylation, growth factor (PDGF, SCF, or FIl-3 ligand respectively. 50 ng/mL, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) was added for 5 minutes. The cells were then centrifuged and lysed in 500 nL lysis buffer (SOmM Tris pH 7.4,1%NP^ 150 mM NaCl, 1 rsM EDTA, 1 rftM Na3V04). The lysate is centrifoged and 10 pL of antibody against the respective receptor was added to the supernatant (anti-PDGFR (P20), anti-c-Kit (C-19), and anti-Flt-3 (S18), Santa Cniz Biotechnology, Inc.). The iramunocomplexes were isolated with Protein G beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and PAGE was performed. A Western Blot was done using an antibody against pbospho-tyrosine residues (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The intensity of the phospho-tyrosine signal corresponding to various drug concentrations provides a way to determine the IC50 of the test compound for the inhibition of autophosphorylation.<br>
In general, the compounds exemplified herein have been found to exhibit an IC50 of less than 10 jxM in one or more of the above assays.<br>
Pharmacokinetics<br>
To evaluate pharmacokinetics, male Sprague Dawley rats (CD strain, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were dosed with test compounds via intravenous (IV) administration, at 1 mg/kg concentration, and oral (PO) administration, at 10 mg/kg concentration. Blood samples were collected from animals pre-dose, and at 2,5,15, and 30 minutes, and at 1,2,4,6,8, and 24 hours post-dose. Plasma concentiiUions were determined by hquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (MDS SCIEX API 4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed by non-compartmental methods using the WinNonlin Version 3.2 software package (Pharsight Mountain View, CA). Oral bioavailability was determined as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) in the graph of plasma concentration versus time for PO administration to the corresponding quantity for IV administration. The oral bioavailability in rats, for example, of 3-[3,5-dimethyl-4-(3-oxo-3-piperazin-l-yIpropyl)-lH-pyrrol-2-ylmethyleDe]-l,3-dihydroindol-2-one, determined by this method, was 50.6 %.<br>
