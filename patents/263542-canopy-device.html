CMSDVY  DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to a shielding or canopy device, in particular cin iiTObrella or parasol, comprising a rod, a canopy of flexible material connected to the rod close to an end thereof, with operating means displaceable along the rod for closing or opening the camopy and means for tensioning the canopy, which canopy tensioning means comprise a set of first tensioning members EOid a set of second tensioning members, wherein the first tensioning members are each pivotally connected with one first outer end to the rod and extend therefrom along the canopy to a position close to the peripheiry thereof, and wherein the second tensioning members are each pivotally connected with a first outer end to the operating means and are connected with a second outer end to a corresponding first tensioning member. Such a canopy device is generally known and is normally referred to as an umbrella or parasol.<br>
The umbrella is very old and has evolved from sunshade for the well-to-do to an umbrella which is now a completely normal sight on a rainy day.<br>
Present umbrellas are vulnerable and not wind-resist ant, particularly at a wind speed greater than four on the Beaufort scale. Even the so-called wind-resistant umbrellas are very uncomfortable in a strong wind. Rain occurs regularly in combination with wind, whereby there is a need for an umbrella which is still comfortable in the case of strong wind, i.e. also at a wind speed greater than four on the Beaufort scale, and which is moreover so robust that it does not collapse. Much of the damage occurring in existing umbrellas takes place on or around the pivot points arranged on the ribs. In addition, the tipped protrusions of<br><br>
the umbrella often represent a hazard for passers-by, all the more so as these protrusions are often situated at eye level.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to propose a canopy device of the type stated in the introduction wherein the stated problems are avoided and additional advantages are also provided.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, this object is achieved in a canopy device of the above described type in that the connection between the first and second tensioning members is arranged closer to the periphery of the canopy than to the rod, and is preferably situated substantially close to the periphery of the canopy.<br>
The canopy device according to the present invention forms a robust umbrella in that an alternative is provided for the vulnerable pivot points which in present -umbrellas are often mounted on the ribs. Absorption of the forces takes place via generation of contact surfaces of the ribs.<br>
As a result of their generally circular and therefore poor aerodynamic form, conventional umbrellas are often very unstable when exposed to windy weather conditions. By improving the stability a canopy device is proposed according to a second aspect of the invention wherein the canopy has an asymmetrical form, the rod is connected eccentrically to the canopy, and the tensioning members have differing lengths. Because the canopy has an asymmetrical form, the canopy device according to the present invention has improved aerodynamics which ensure that the canopy device will seek to take up a stable position when exposed to gusts of wind. As a result the resistance will decrease discernibly and it will be possible to handle the umbrella according to the present invention more comfortably in windy weather conditions. Furthermore, due to this self-adjusting equilibriiom the<br><br>
canopy device is less likely to be overloaded, which will enhance durability.<br>
A vulneraJDle point in known umbrellas is the pivot connection between the ribs and the closing and opening mechanism. According to a third aspect, the invention therefore provides a canopy device wherein the pivotable connection between the operating means and each of the second tensioning members comprises a sxibstantially flexible pivoting element, which is connected on one side to the first outer end of the second tensioning member and on the other side to the displaceable operating means.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the canopy device according to the invention are described in the sub-claims.<br>
Finally, the invention further relates to cajiopy tensioning means and a pivot connection for use in a canopy device as described here-<br>
An exemplary embodiment is further elucidated in the following descriptions with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>

Fig. 16 shows a cross-sectional view of yet another preferred embodiment in which the profiles of the tensioning members have co-acting forms.<br>
The preferred embodiments as shown in figures 1 to 16 comprise a canopy device 1 (umbrella or parasol),   a rod 2 with operating means 4 for closing or opening canopy 3, wherein the canopy is tensioned in the opened position using canopy tensioning means 5 comprising first tensioning members 5a and second tensioning members 5b. The canopy 3, which can be used to protect the user from weather influences such as<br><br>
rain or siin, consists of a flexible and preferably dursible and water-repellent material, such as for instance polyester fabric.<br>
The first 5a and second tensioning members 5b or ribs are mutually connected in the vicinity of, or even at the position of, the peripheral edge of canopy 3. This prevents the outer part of canopy 3 being folded back when the wind catches the underside thereof, as is often the case with conventional canopy devices. Tensioning members 5a emd 5b extend siibstantially parallel over some distance from their mutual connection, for instance a glue connection, wherein they have a contact surface which can absorb forces which occur the instance when the umbrella is exposed to gusts of wind. Canopy device 1 according to the present invention provides a robust umbrella in that an alternative is applied, based on contact surfaces, to the vulnerable pivot points which in present umbrellas are often moiinted on the ribs. When the umbrella is loaded as a result of the wind strength, the ribs (the first 5a and second tensioning members 5b) will generate, where generate is used in the meaning of transferring a curved surface to a substantially flat surface like the uncoiling of a foot when walking, over this contact surface and so absorb and distribute the force over this contact surface. Figure 12 shows a canopy device with first 5a and second tensioning members 5b with a contact surface A, As a result of a load the contact surface A' will increase due to the generation, as shown in figure 13. Peak loads such as occur in conventional rib constructions with hinges are prevented by this generation.<br>
The first and second tensioning members 5a, 5b take a form such that a generation is guaranteed wherein the contact surface is maintained. When loaded, the tensioning members<br><br>
will hereby not shift along each other and load and possibly damage the canopy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the tensioning members have a substantially lower bending stiffness in a first direction 15 than in a second direction 16. In the embodiment shown in figures 1 and 4 the tensioning members are embodied as flat strips. Such flat strips bend relatively easily in a first direction 15 perpendicularly of the plane of the strip but have relative bending stiffness in the transverse direction 16, i.e. in the plane of the strip- When loaded, the tensioning members will bend in the first direction 15 and here define a contact surface A which becomes increasingly larger and which absorbs the load. Because the bending stiffness in transverse direction 16 is greater than the bending stiffness in the first direction 15 perpendicularly of the plane of the strip forming the tensioning member, this direction corresponding to the direction of load, the tensioning members will only bend very little in lateral direction. The central axes 25a, 25b of the first and second tensioning members will hereby undergo only a very small relative displacement in transverse direction 16. The contact surface is therefore maintained and the possibility of the tensioning members shifting along each other is in this way prevented•<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the first and second tensioning members comprise co-acting forms which ensure that the first and second tensioning members are guided in each other. This ensures that a contact surface is maintained between the tensioning members and the tensioning members are prevented from shifting along each other. Specifically the second tensioning members 105b, 205b, 305b are, due to their form, guided or nested in the first tensioning members 105a, 205a, 305a. As the load increases<br><br>
the first and second tensioning meTnbers will obtain .an increasingly larger contact surface and the co-acting forms of the first and second tensioning metnbers will ensure that a relative movement in transverse direction between the two tensioning members is prevented. A non-exhaustive number of examples of profiles guaranteeing such a form-fitting are shown in figures 13, 14, 15 and 16. As shown in figure 15, it is not essential that both tensioning members have the same profile shape.<br>
The operating means 4 (fig. 5) are displaceable and preferably take the form of a hollow t\ibe which encloses rod 2 for a significant part of its length and is slidable therealong. When canopy 3 is closed, this hollow tube occupies an uppermost position close to the connection of canopy 3 to rod 2, and is movable downward therefrom along rod 2 in order to open canopy 3. Operating means 4 are preferably manufactured from a UV-resistant, stiff material which can be injection moulded and glued, such as for instance POM. On the side where tensioning members 5b are mounted the operating means 4 comprise a so-called runner 10, which is shown in detail in fig. 8.<br>
The pivotable connection between operating means 4 and each of the second tensioning members 5b comprises a siibstantially flexible pivot element 7 which is connected on one side to the first outer end of the second tensioning member 5b and on the other side to the displaceable operating means 4 (fig. 8) . Pivot element 7 is preferably embodied in fibres of a flexible and durable material, such as for instance aramid or Dyneema*. Pivot element 7 is more preferably manufactured from fibres or fibre ribbons woven in the form of a sleeve, wherein one end of this sleeve is arranged round the first outer end of the second tensioning member 5b and fixed thereto by glueing or crimping (fig. 8).<br><br>
The other outer end of the sleeve-like pivot element is fixed by clamping to the displaceable operating means 4. /<br>
The handle comprises two parts, of which the first part 8a is arranged on rod 2 and the second part 8b on operating means 4. In the closed position of canopy 3 these two individual parts of handle 8 are remote from each other  ' (fig. 6), and the umbrella can be carried with the preferably knob-like part arranged on rod 2. When the two separate parts of the handle are displaced toward each other so that they form substantially one whole (fig. 7), the umbrella will be opened, i.e. canopy 3 will be moved to an outspread position. When the imbrella is in this extreme position, a locking member 9 in the form of a button biased by means of a curved metal strip provides a locking which ensures that the umbrella remains locked in this opened position (fig. 7). The locking can be released by pressing in this locking member 9, and the umbrella can be closed again by moving apart the two handle parts 8a and 8b.<br>
Arranged on the outer end of rod 2 opposite the handle are mounting means 11 comprising a cap 12, a positioning ring 13 and a cover 14 (fig. 9).<br>
When canopy 3 is situated in opened position, the tensioning means 5 consisting of first 5a and second tensioning members 5b extend substantially radially from rod 2. In this opened position at least the second tensioning members 5b are under bias (fig. 4). At least the second tensioning members 5b are preferably manufactured from a fibre-reinforced plastic, and ideally all tensioning members are manufactured from a fibre-reinforced plastic.<br>
In the shown preferred embodiment canopy 3 has an asymmetrical form and rod 2 is connected eccentrically to canopy 3 (fig. 1-3). Tensioning members 5a and 5b will have different lengths in accordance with the asymmetrical form<br><br>
(fig. 3), which substantially corresponds in a side view with a wing profile (fig. 2) and in a top view is sxobstantially egg-shaped (fig. 3). Because canopy 3 has an asymmetrical form, canopy device 1 has improved aerodynamics which ensure that it assumes a stable position when it is exposed to gusts of wind. As a result the resistance will decrease discemibly and the umbrella according to the present invention will be more comfortable to handle in windy weather conditions. Furthermore, owing to this self-adjusting equilibrium the canopy device is less likely to be overloaded, which will enhance durability.<br>
The asymmetrical form of canopy 3 also provides the user with the option of carrying the rod 2 of the umbrella next to him/her when there is little wind and still holding canopy 3 above the body.<br>
The canopy device is preferably embodied with protective means 6 for protecting the outer ends of tensioning members 5a and 5b lying close to the periphery of canopy 3, these protective means 6 comprising for instance a guard for each outer end* In a preferred embodiment this guard is pivotable around an axis C-C, as shown in fig. 10, arranged on the outer end of one of the tensioning members 5a or 5b opposite rod 2, whereby this guard can also be pivoted to a folded-in position (fig. 10). Canopy 3 can also be clamped in the folded-in position of protective means 6. In the folded-in position thereof the guard provides a rounded surface on the canopy periphery which comprises s-ubstantially no protruding parts and therefore has a reduced risk of injuring passers-by when canopy 3 is in the opened position.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment (not shown here) rod 2 and tensioning members 5a and 5b can take a divided form, wherein the dimensions of the parts of rod 2 and tensioning members 5a and 5b substantially correspond, and<br><br>
rod 2 is movable between a ready-to-use position and a storing position in which the dimensions of canopy device 1 are considerably smaller than in the ready-to-use position. The canopy device according to the invention can thus be stored very compactly, whereby it can be put away in a bag or coat pocket-<br>
The above described embodiments, although they show preferred embodiments of the invention, are intended solely by way of illustration of the present invention and not to limit in any way the specification of the device. The different new aspects of the canopy device according to the invention can, while retaining the associated advantages, also be applied in other combinations and optionally even in otherwise conventional canopy devices. The described and shown pivot connection for instance could thus also be used for applications other than parasols or umbrellas, for instance as connection between the boom and the mast of a sailing boat or sailboard.
