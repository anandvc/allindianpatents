				<td>The present invention relates in general to an apparatus for measuring the glucose concentration<br>
in a tissue sample and more particularly, to an apparatus for determining the concentration of a target<br>
analyte in an aqueous sample by using multi spectral analysis.<br>
Data analysis during spectroscopic analysis refers to the process of finding optimum<br>
wavelengths and generating accurate calibrations to relate a given set of spectroscopic data to reference<br>
laboratory values for the composition of a set of samples such that it is possible to analyze, i.e. predict<br>
the values of future samples of unknown composition. Calibration of spectroscopic instruments that are<br>
used to perform spectroscopic measurements is typically accomplished by application of multiple<br>
regression of the absorbance at some number of wavelengths against the reference laboratory values,<br>
i.e. mathematically determining the best possible fit of a straight line to a set of data (see for example.<br>
H. Mark, Principles and Practice of spectroscopic calibration, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1991))<br>
An error free calibration, i.e. a sample for which Beer"s law applies is one in which the<br>
constituent of interest and which the only constituent in the sample is dissolved in a completely non<br>
absorbing solvent and has only a signal absorbance band. In this case the concentration of the<br>
constituent is known exactly over a board range for the set of calibration samples; and the spectrometer<br>
has no noise, nonlinerity, or other fault. In such an idealized case, the height of the absorbance peak is<br>
strictly proportional to the concentration of the constituent. Thus it is possible to calibrate a system<br>
using only two samples because two points determine the line and the slope of the line and intercept of<br>
data are readily determined using known mathematical formulae.<br>
Unfortunately, the ideal case does not prevail in the real world. For example,<br>
spectroscopic measurements are subject to such phenomena as skew in the data, which is<br>
caused by physical changes in the instrument, sample, or experiment. For example,<br>
interfering and/or dominating constituents in the sample other than the constituent of interest<br>
can affect the data. Temperature, medium, pathlength, and scattering effects must also be<br>
considered.<br>
Near-infrared (near-IR) absorbance spectra of liquid samples contain a large amount<br>
of information about the various organic constituents of the sample. Specifically, the<br>
vibrational, rotational, and stretching energy associated with organic molecular structures<br>
(e.g. carbon-hydrogen, oxygen-hydrogen, and nitrogen-hydrogen chemical bonds)<br>
produce perturbations in the hear-IR region which can be detected and related to the<br>
concentration of various organic constituents present in the sample. However, in complex<br>
sample matrices, near-IR spectra also contain an appreciable amount of interference, due in<br>
part to similarities of structure amongst analytes, relative levels of analyte concentration,<br>
interfering relationships between analytes, and the magnitude of electronic and chemical<br>
noise inherent in a particular system. Such interference reduces the efficiency and precision<br>
of measurements obtained using near-IR spectrometry to determine the concentration of<br>
liquid sample analyses.<br>
For example, temperature is a critical parameter for near-IR spectroscopic analysis<br>
of aqueous based samples. Major water absorption bands are centered at approximately<br>
3800, 5200, and 6900 nm, but the exact positions of these bands are temperature sensitive.<br>
These bands shift to higher frequencies at higher temperatures. Changes in temperature<br>
also alter the extent of water hydrogen bonding to other chemical species, which causes<br>
significant shifts in band positions. The large water content of most clinical samples, e.g.<br>
when determining glucose concentration in an aqueous solution, necessitates precise control<br>
of the sample temperature.<br>

Insensitive Near-Infrared Spectroscopic Measurement of Glucose in Aqueous Solutions,<br>
Applied Spectroscopy, Vol. 48, No. 4, pp. 477-483 (1994) disclose the use of a digital<br>
Fourier filter that is combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression to generate a<br>
calibration model for glucose that is insensitive to sample temperature. The calibration<br>
model is initially created using spectra collected over the 5000 to 4000 nm spectral range<br>
with samples maintained at 37°C. The model is evaluated by judging the ability to<br>
determine glucose concentrations from a set of prediction spectra. Absorption spectra in the<br>
prediction set are obtained by ratioing single-beam spectra collected from solutions at<br>
temperatures ranging from 32°C to 41°C to reference spectra collected at 37°C. The<br>
temperature sensitivity of the underlying water absorption bands creates large baseline<br>
variations in the prediction spectra that are effectively eliminated by the Fourier filtering<br>
step.<br>

Glucose Determination in Biological Matrices Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, Ph.D.<br>
Thesis, Univ. of Iowa (August 1995) (glucose determinations in water, serum, blood, and<br>
the body are performed using near-IR spectroscopy, multivariate analysis is used to<br>
correlate minor spectral variations with analyte concentrations.<br>
A number of near-IR devices and methods have been described that may be used in<br>
connection with the foregoing techniques to provide noninvasive blood analyte<br>
determinations:<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,360,004 to Purdy et al. describes a method and apparatus for the<br>
determination of blood analyte concentrations, wherein a body portion is irradiated with<br>
radiation containing two or more distinct bands of continuous-wavelength incident<br>
radiation. Purdy et al. emphasize filtration techniques to specifically block radiation at the<br>
two peaks in the near-IR absorption spectrum for water, occurring at about 1440 and 1935<br>
nm. Such selective blocking is carried out in order to avoid a heating effect that may be due<br>
to the absorption of radiation by water in the body part being irradiated.<br>
By contrast, U.S. Patent No. 5,267,152 to Yang et al. describes noninvasive<br>
devices and techniques for measuring blood glucose concentration using only the portion of<br>
the IR spectrum which contains the near-IR water absorption peaks {e.g. the water<br>
transmission window, which includes those wavelengths between 1300 and 1900 nm),<br>
where water absorbance reaches a minimum at 1600 nm. Optically controlled light is<br>
directed to a tissue source and then collected by an integrating sphere. The collected light is<br>
analyzed and blood glucose concentration calculated using a stored reference calibration<br>
curve.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,606,164 to Price et al. describes a method and apparatus for<br>
measuring the concentration of an analyte present in a biological fluid. near-IR radiation is<br>
applied to calibration samples to produce calibration data. Unknown sample data is<br>
analyzed using data pretreatment followed by projection into the calibration model space<br>
with prediction of analyte concentration using the calibration model.<br>
Devices have also been described for use in determination of analyte concentrations<br>
in complex samples, for example:<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,242,602 to Richardson et al. describes methods for analyzing<br>
aqueous systems to detect multiple components. The methods involve determination of the<br>
absorbance or emission spectrum of the components over the range of 200 to 2500 nm, and<br>
application of chemometrics algorithms to extract segments of the spectral data obtained to<br>
quantify multiple performance indicators.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,252,829 to Nygaard et al. describes a method and apparatus for<br>
measuring the concentration of urea in a milk sample using an infrared attenuation<br>
measuring technique. Multivariate techniques are carried out to determine spectral<br>
contributions of known components using partial least squares algorithms, principal<br>
component regression, multiple linear regression or artificial neural network learning.<br>
Calibration is carried out by accounting for the component contributions that block the<br>
analyte signal of interest. Thus, Nygaard et al. describe a technique of measuring multiple<br>
analyte infrared attenuations and compensating for the influence of background analyses to<br>
obtain a more accurate measurement.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,975,581 to Robinson et al. describes a method and apparatus for<br>
determining analyte concentration in a biological sample based on a comparison of infrared<br>
energy absorption (i.e. differences in absorption at several wavelengths) between a known<br>
analyte concentration and a sample. The comparison is performed using partial least squares<br>
analysis or other multivariate techniques.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,882,492 to Schlager describes a method and apparatus for<br>
noninvasive determination of blood analyte concentrations. Modulated IR radiation is<br>
directed against a tissue sample (e.g. an ear lobe) and either passed through the tissue or<br>
impinged on a skin surface where it is spectrally modified by a target analyte (glucose).<br>
The spectrally modified radiation is then split, wherein one portion is directed through a<br>
negative correlation cell and another through a reference cell. Intensity of the radiation<br>
passing through the cells are compared to determine analyte concentration in the sample.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,306,152 to Ross et al. describes an optical fluid analyzer<br>
designed to minimize the effect of background absorption (i.e. the overall or base level<br>
optical absorbance of the fluid sample) on the accuracy of measurement in a turbid sample<br>
or in a liquid sample which is otherwise difficult to analyze. The apparatus measures an<br>
optical signal at the characteristic optical absorption of a sample component of interest and<br>
another signal at a wavelength selected to approximate background absorption, and then<br>
subtracts to reduce the background component of the analyte dependent signal.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,893,253 to Lodder describes a method for analyzing intact<br>
capsules and tablets by using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. The method detects<br>
adulterants in capsules by obtaining spectra for a training set of unadulterated samples,<br>
representing each spectrum as a point in a hyperspace, creating a number of training set<br>
replicates and a bootstrap replicate distribution, calculating the center of the bootstrap<br>
replicate distribution, obtaining a spectrum for an adulterated sample, transforming the<br>
spectrum into a point in hyperspace, and identifying the adulterated sample as abnormal<br>
based on a relationship between the adulterated sampl"s hyperspatial point and the bootstrap<br>
replication distribution.<br>
See, also, R. Rosenthal, L. Paynter, L. Mackie, Non-Invasive Measurement of<br>
Blood Glucose, U.S. Patent No. 5,028,787 (2 July 1991) (A near-infrared quantitative<br>
analysis instrument and method non-invasively measures blood glucose by analyzing near-<br>
infrared energy following interactance with venous or arterial blood, or transmission<br>
through a blood containing body part.).<br>
The accuracy of information obtained using the above described methods and<br>
devices is limited by the spectral interference caused by background, i.e. non-analyte,<br>
sample constituents that also have absorption spectra in the near-IR range. Appreciable<br>
levels of background noise represent an inherent system limitation particularly when very<br>
little analyte is present. In light of this limitation, attempts have been maderto improve<br>
signal-to-noise ratios, e.g. by avoiding water absorption peaks to enable the use of<br>
increased radiation intensity, by reducing the amount of spectral information to be analyzed,<br>
or by using subtraction or compensation techniques based on an approximation of<br>
background absorption. As discussed above, these techniques have focused primarily<br>
upon examining all constituents of a spectra simultaneously. Although such techniques<br>
have provided some improvement, there remains a need to provide a method and apparatus<br>
for performing a more precise determination of the concentration of analytes, for example in<br>
a liquid matrix, i.e. where an accurate representation of each and every sample component<br>
is obtained during analysis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides one or more basis sets that are applied to a spectroscopic<br>
signal during analysis to produce an accurate spectral representation from which analyte<br>
concentration may be accurately determined. The presently preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention is applicable for the determination of such analytes as glucose in serum, as<br>
determined using non-invasive techniques. For example, in the basis sets, near-IR<br>
absorbance features over the 1100 to 2500 nm spectral region are provided for water,<br>
albumin protein, globulin protein, triacetin, cholesterol, BUN, and glucose. In addition,<br>
sample temperature effects are also included, along with instrument noise levels.<br>
A basis set includes all interfering components found in a sample, such as serum.<br>
These components can include, for example, water, temperature/hydrogen bonding effects,<br>
albumin globulin protein, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea, and all organic components. The<br>
basis set also includes electrolytes, such as Na+, K+ and Cl-<br>
The basis set does not include those components that do not interfere, such as<br>
anything that in terms of concentration is loss than the background signal or noise level.<br>
With regard to an analyte, such as glucose, it is necessary to define those components of a<br>
sample that have a larger interference than that of glucose. Instead of considering only the<br>
analytes that are mentioned above, which are all in blood or serum, a basis set may be<br>
generated, for example, that produces a transform for the red blood cells that interfere or<br>
scatter the light; and also for skin effects.<br>
Once the spectra of each of these components is known, it is then necessary to<br>
determine how the components interact, e.g. taking serum data, extracting each of the<br>
components, and then comparing the spectra for the individual components with that of the<br>
components in solution.<br>
Thus, once a basis set is generated for glucose in the presence of water, it is<br>
determined that water interferes with glucose, and it is determined how to remove the<br>
water, then a basis set for a next component can be generated, such as for temperature<br>
effect. In the example of non-invasive glucose concentration determination, the invention<br>
sequentially adds basis sets for other components, e.g. globulin, protein, triglycerides,<br>
urea, or cholesterol, in the presence of water, to build up to a serum matrix. Once basis<br>
sets are generated for serum, it is then possible to generate basis sets for red blood cells,<br>
muscle layers, skin layers, fat layers, even the whole body.<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for measuring the glucose concentration<br>
in a tissue sample, comprising the steps of:<br>
a spectroscopic sensor for collecting an analog spectroscopic signal from said sample,<br>
said spectrographic signal comprising substantially all relevant spectral components of said<br>
sample;<br>
an analog-to-digital converter coupled to an output of said spectroscopic sensor for<br>
converting said spectroscopic signal collected by said spectroscopic sensor to a digital signal;<br>
an electronic filter coupled to said analog to digital converter for receiving said digital<br>
signal therefrom, said electronic filter substantially removing at least one spectral component<br>
of said spectrographic signal that comprises a relevant interfering component of said sample,<br>
wherein an interfering component comprises any of a chemical, physical, and environmental<br>
phenomenon that results in a signal at least one wavelength where glucose absorbs, said<br>
electronic filter outputting a signal that is representative of said glucose concentration in said<br>
sample; and<br>
a display for receiving said output signal from said electronic filter and for generating<br>
a human perceptible representation thereof.<br>
It is significant to note that the basis set approach herein thus characterizes each<br>
component in a sample, as well as all other possible interference and, after producing an<br>
accurate representation of each component at each frequency of interest, subtracts each<br>
interferant from the spectra produced at the frequency of interest. In this way, all<br>
interferants may be identified within the context of all other relevant sample components,<br>
and thence removed from the spectra, leaving substantially only the signal produced by the<br>
analyte of interest.<br>
The various basis sets may be also combined mathematically to generate a set of<br>
transforms that may be stored in a look-up table for use during analysis. In this way, a fast<br>
real time determination of analyte concentration may be made using relatively simple, low<br>
power computer hardware, e.g. a low power embedded controller.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following discussion describes what the basis set is, how it is collected, the<br>
instrument that is required, the data,collection parameters, the data analysis as far as such<br>
factors as temperature and path length are concerned, and what are considered to be<br>
additional basis sets.<br>
The simplest example of a basis set is a basis set that includes all interfering<br>
components in a sample, such as serum. These components can include, for example,<br>
water, temperature/hydrogen bonding effects, albumin, and globulin protein, triglycerides,<br>
cholesterol, urea, all organic components, and Na+, K+, and Cl. To a lesser degree, the<br>
basis set may include additional electrolytes.<br>
- The basis set does not include those components that do not interfere, such as<br>
anything that in terms of concentration is less than the background signal or noise. With<br>
regard to an analyse, such as glucose, it is necessary to define those components of a<br>
sample that have a larger interference than that of glucose. Instead of considering only the<br>
analytes that are mentioned above, which are all in blood or serum, a basis set may be<br>
generated, for example, that produces a transform for the red blood cells that interfere or<br>
scatter the light; and also for skin effects.<br>
Once the spectra of all these components is known, it is then necessary to determine<br>
how each of these components interact, e.g. taking serum data, extracting each of the<br>
components, and then comparing the spectra for the individual components with that of the<br>
components in solution.<br>
Once a basis set is generated for glucose in the presence of water, it is determined<br>
that water interferes with glucose, and it is determined how to remove the water, then a<br>
basis set for a next component can be generated, such as for temperature effect. In the<br>
example of non-invasive glucose concentration determination, the invention sequentially<br>
adds basis sets for other components, e.g. globulin, protein, triglycerides, urea, or<br>
cholesterol, in the presence of water, to build up to a serum matrix. Once basis sets are<br>
generated for serum, it is then possible to generate basis sets for red blood cells, muscle<br>
layers, skin layers, fat layers, even the whole body.<br>
It is significant to note that the basis set approach herein thus characterizes each<br>
component in a sample, as well as all other possible interferants, and subtracts each<br>
interferant from the spectra produced at the frequency of interest. In this way, all<br>
interferants are identified within the context of the sample and systematically from the<br>
spectra, leaving substantially only the signal produced by the analyte of interest.<br>
The various basis sets may be combined mathematically to generate a set of<br>
transforms that may be stored in a look-up table for use during analysis. In this way, a<br>
fast, real time determination of analyte concentration may be made using relatively simple,<br>
low power computer hardware, e.g. a low power embedded controller.<br>
Once it is determined which components are present in the sample, it is necessary to<br>
determine the best method of collecting spectra for these components. However, it is also<br>
necessary to define instrument specifications, such as signal to noise ratio, resolution, and<br>
wavelength reproducibility, before the spectra can be collected. These instrument<br>
considerations are discussed in detail below.<br>
The procedure for generating basis sets is iterative. In some embodiments of the<br>
invention it is necessary to consider such factors as scatter correction, refractive index<br>
correction, depth of penetration into the tissue, total optical path length, and temperature.<br>
Once the basis sets are generated, they may be applied to a spectroscopic input signal. The<br>
signal thus processed by the basis sets is then preprocessed using standard chemometric<br>
techniques, such as smoothing and second derivative analysis.<br>
Another approach to processing after application of the basis sets is that of<br>
deconvolution. If deconvolution is used, then it is necessary to perform temperature<br>
correction after the data collection and scatter correction. This approach uses the basis sets<br>
to identify and isolate various components of the sample in an iterative fashion. Thereafter,<br>
multivariate analysis may be applied, which may include partial least squares analysis or<br>
principal components analysis. Such processing is a matter of choice and is well known in<br>
the art. For example, in a glucose concentration C for which there is a spectra of<br>
interferograms n x m, where m is the number of interferograms and n is the number of<br>
interferogram points, a data reduction is performed, in which:<br>
C = bo + b1P1+...bnPn; (1)<br>
where Pi are PLS factor scores derived from the interferogram points and concentration<br>
values; and bj provides the regression coefficients.<br>
Unique to the invention, various transforms such as deconvolution are performed<br>
with reference to the basis set. Pre-processing also relies on the basis set in the invention.<br>
For example, in the case of a Fourier filter in which certain frequencies pass through the<br>
filter, it is necessary to know what frequency the filter passed. In this way, it is possible to<br>
determine if the analyte is passed by the filter. The basis set is referenced to identify the<br>
analyte concentration at various frequencies, such that the Fourier filter only need be<br>
applied at those frequencies of interest, and not across a broad range of absorbance<br>
frequencies (as is practiced in the prior art). Thus, the basis set may loosely be thought of<br>
in this application as a filter for the filter.<br>
Various molecular relations may be considered to be basis sets in themselves, such<br>
as carbon-hydrogen, oxygen-hydrogen, and nitrogen-hydrogen bonding. In such cases,<br>
there are more absorbance bands than can be accounted for by these fundamental<br>
components. This means that there are related effects for those portions of molecular<br>
structures to which these components are bonded. Thus, even though these molecules or<br>
pieces of molecules may be found in common among different constituents, it is possible to<br>
assign them to a constituent and then discard them during deconvolution because of the<br>
signature across the spectra of a particular constituent.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow diagram showing the generation of a basis set according to the<br>
invention. The first step of the process involves identifying relevant interfering<br>
components of the sample at the same frequency as that of the analyte (100). This step and<br>
subsequent steps may be performed using known spectroscopic and chemometric<br>
techniques, as is discussed in greater detail below. Once the interfering components are<br>
identified, the relevant interfering components are then all identified at other frequencies to<br>
quantify absorbance at these other frequencies (102)."-The interfering components, once<br>
quantified, are then removed at the frequency of the analyte (104). Each iteration of the<br>
foregoing steps may be described as a separate basis set. Thus, the invention produces a<br>
plurality of basis sets for an analyte.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block schematic diagram of an instrument that incorporates one or more<br>
basis sets according to the invention. In operation, a device 10, collects spectra 20 using<br>
standard or modified (see below) spectroscopic devices. The spectra are provided to the<br>
input port/buffer 21 of a system that includes a processor 22. The input port/buffer may<br>
include an analog-to-digital conversion function, such that spectral data collected by the<br>
spectroscopic device are converted to digital data. The processor operates upon such digital<br>
input data in accordance with various transforms stored in one or more look-up tables<br>
(LUTs). The LUTs contain transforms that incorporate the various basis sets. The<br>
transform process performed by the processor uses the basis sets to identify and remove<br>
substantially all interfering constituents from the spectral signal produced by the<br>
spectroscopic device. Once processing with regard to the basis sets is completed, the<br>
digital signal contains substantially only the analyte information. This information is then<br>
further processed in accordance with known spectroscopic calibration and chemometric<br>
techniques and provided to an output port/buffer 24. The output information may then be<br>
observed on a display 26, in any desired format, to provide an accurate indication of analyte<br>
r<br>
concentration within the sample.<br>
As also discussed both above and below, the basis sets generated in accordance<br>
with the invention herein may be stored in a lookup table or they may be mixed in with the<br>
other transform information. In producing such look-up tables, the basis sets first exist as<br>
matrix raw data collected during the iterative process of generating the several basis sets. In<br>
view of the several basis sets generated in the preferred embodiment of thejnvention, there<br>
may be different matrices in the look-up tables, or there may be a single matrix that<br>
generates a transform which is representative of all of the basis sets and that is applied<br>
directly to the raw data. Thus, one embodiment of the invention takes each of the<br>
components and builds them into a complex matrix that comprises an algorithm for<br>
identifying and removing interferants. In this way, the invention provides a system that<br>
accurately represents how the components appear within the spectra of interest when such<br>
components are all combined. It is this ability of the invention to identify each relevant<br>
component of a sample individually within the context of each other component that allows<br>
the ultimate determination of look-up table entries for an analyte of interest.<br>
Although possible, the presently preferred embodiment of the invention does not<br>
provide spectra of glucose that has been corrected for all interferants at all concentration<br>
levels in a lookup table. Rather, there are a series of spectra of the analyte at certain<br>
different physiological concentrations of interest. For example, in the case of glucose,<br>
there are look-up basis set values for hypo- and hyperglycemia concentrations. Thus, the<br>
invention does not need to represent all of the information in all of the basis sets in the look-up<br>
tables. Rather, it is only necessary to represent information over the whole range of<br>
glucose that occurs in the body. The approach is taken for albumin protein, and other<br>
sampje components. As discussed above, a single equation may be written for all of the<br>
spectral information in this matrix, or one or more look-up tables may be provided. In any<br>
event, this approach of storing only useful spectral information in the look-up tables<br>
reduces the memory and processing power requirements of the instrument.<br>
As discussed more fully below, the basis sets are first generated and, thereafter,<br>
incorporated into an instrument for use during analysis. To determine those values that are<br>
to be put into the look-up tables it is necessary to go through any number of basis sets. As<br>
discussed above, it is necessary to identify the major interfering components that affect the<br>
analyte in the sample and generate basis sets for each and every one of these components.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block schematic diagram of an instrument that implements an algorithm<br>
which incorporates one or more basis sets according to the invention. Fig. 3 provides a<br>
detailed overview of the software/firmware component 30 of the device discussed in<br>
connection with Fig. 2. It should be appreciated that the invention herein is readily applied<br>
to any spectroscopic system. Thus, the system described in connection with Figs. 2 and 3<br>
is provided only as an example of a presently preferred embodiment of the invention and<br>
. not by way of limitation.<br>
During processing within the instrument, the digitized spectral information is first<br>
applied to the basis sets 31. As discussed above (and in greater detail below), the basis sets<br>
are reduced to transforms that remove interfering constituents and/or components (chemical<br>
and/or physical) from the spectral information. The basis sets may be applied before or in<br>
connection with a physical model 32 that corrects for such interfering physical factors as<br>
scattering, pathlength, and/or temperature.<br>
After the spectral information is applied to the basis sets and (optionally) the<br>
physical model, the signal thus produced is deconvolved 33 to correct the signal to a<br>
reference. The signal is next preprocessed 34 and digitally filtered 35. Preprocessing may<br>
employ such techniques as Kubelka-Munk transformation, mean centering, normalization,<br>
baseline correction, scatter correction, and interference correction, although it is presently<br>
preferred that the basis sets be used to resolve such issues as scatter correction, baseline<br>
correction, and interference correction. Correction techniques that may be applied, for<br>
example to scattering, can include multiplicative scatter correction, standard normal variate<br>
correction, and extended multiplicative signal correction. The digital filtering function may<br>
be accomplished by such techniques as Gaussian filtering, low and high bandpass filters,<br>
and Lorentzian filtering.<br>
Spectral wavelengths for the analyte are selected 36 and a multivariate analysis,<br>
such as higher order partial least squares (PLS) is performed 37. Such analysis techniques<br>
may include principal component regression, partial least squares, rotated principal<br>
components, or correlation principal components analysis.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the invention provides a plurality of basis sets that are<br>
used to quantify an analyte in a liquid sample. For purpose of illustration and example, the<br>
invention is now described in connection with glucose quantification in noninvasive<br>
spectra.<br>
Data Collection. The first step of the process involves identifying major interfering<br>
chemical analytes and structures in the body. These factors include, inter alia, water<br>
percentage present in the sample, temperature/hydrogen bonding effects on water, albumin<br>
protein, globulin protein, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea, glucose, lactate, ethanol, also<br>
Na+, K+, C1-, and other electrolytes, glycosylated hemoglobin, skin, keratin, fibrinogen,<br>
and red blood cells. One advantage of the invention is the basis set may be generated in<br>
such way that it includes spectra for all interfering components.<br>
Noninterfering components include, for example, components of lower molar<br>
absorptivity concentration, such as low dosage drugs and medications.<br>
In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, data collection<br>
instrumentation should take into account the following:<br>
• Signal is defined for each analyte by first determining the delta absorption from top<br>
of absorbance band to base, and then by defining the slope of change in absorbance<br>
versus concentration for samples spanning the physiological concentration at all"<br>
frequencies.<br>
• Noise is defined as root mean square (rms) noise of analyte absorbance in the band<br>
of interest.<br>
• Signal to Noise is defined as (slope X concentration) / noise. This value must be<br>
greater than one for a minimum specified concentration to be analyzed.<br>
• Resolution in the presently preferred embodiment of the invention requires a<br>
minimum of seven points per peak.<br>
Another factor to be considered is wavelength reproducibility. In the invention, a<br>
modified NIRS 5000 spectrometer is used to achieve the above criteria.<br>
The data collection parameters for the basis set include the following:<br>
Pathlengths due to. absorbance of water, which is the primary interferant. It<br>
is necessary to select different pathlengths for each spectral window for an<br>
optimal basis set.<br>
In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, these pathlengths are:<br>
• 0 to 2 mm for combination band region;<br>
• 5 to 10 mm for first overtone region; and<br>
• 10 mm or greater for second overtone region.<br>
While not necessary, it is possible to generate a basis set over the entire frequency<br>
range in a single data collection to compare information in different regions. In the<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, this dictates a 1 mm pathlength. Optimal signal to<br>
noise levels are obtained separately. It is also necessary to provide continuous spectra to<br>
identify and model parameters, such as change in refractive index as a function of<br>
frequency.<br>
For applications that involve the use of diffuse reflection, pathlength considerations<br>
are not taken into account because light penetration is proportional to the inverse of water<br>
absorbance, as defined by the system, based upon molecules interacting with specific<br>
concentrations at specific refractive indices.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention it is desirable to use optical filters. Because<br>
water behaves as natural short pass filter, it is advantageous to use long pass cutoff filters<br>
in conjunction with water bands to form a bandpass filter (although a system that provides<br>
sufficient resolution, i.e. a sufficient number of analog-to-digital (A/D) bit, may not require<br>
a filter). In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, any filter in the midst of<br>
the H2O absorbance band may be used, e.g. the following filters may be used:<br>
• 1950 nm long pass filter for the combination band;<br>
• 1450 nm long pass filter for the first overtone; and<br>
• 1100 nm long pass filter for the second overtone.<br>
The number of averaged scans for each spectra must be determined, where noise<br>
decreases with an increasing number of scans. In the presently preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, noise vs. number of averaged scans is set to 64 averaged scans.<br>
Replicate spectra. Experiments were conducted in which four replicates were<br>
collected due to the temperature coefficient of the spectrometer. The following results were<br>
obtained (which were due to the spectrometer used to make the measurements ~ these<br>
results are not indicative of a general phenomenon):<br>
• First replicate - outlier due to temperature;<br>
• Second replicate - small outlier characteristics; and<br>
• Fourth replicate - acceptable for further analysis.<br>
For purpose of experiments conducted in connection with the invention, the<br>
following additional parameters were defined:<br>
• Ionic strength is 0.1 M to match that of the body;<br>
• pH 7.35 phosphate buffer to approximate that of the body;"<br>
• Temperature maintained at 38.0 ± 0.2°C to match that of the body;<br>
• Components: ACS reagent grade chemicals used as standards.<br>
Data Analysis. Data analysis must take into account temperature variations. In the<br>
presently preferred embodiment of the invention, temperature variations of 0.1 °C are<br>
observed to severely obscure the analyte absorbance bands (even concentrated albumin).<br>
Laboratory and instrument temperatures are impossible to control to 0.01°C for daily use.<br>
This effect is amplified in regions of high water absorbance and large changes of water<br>
absorbance due to temperature.<br>
Data analysis must take into account pathlength. This consideration is similar to<br>
differential measurements taken in dual beam spectrometers, where one beam is focused<br>
through the sample and a second beam is focused through a pathlength corresponding to the<br>
pathlength interference in the sample.<br>
It is desirable to control pathlength to 0.0001 mm. For a 1 mm cell with buffer<br>
present there is a 1 mm pathlength of water. When an analyte is present, the pathlength of<br>
water is reduced due to displacement. The displacement is linearly proportional to the<br>
concentration of the analyte present. While various components of the sample may be<br>
rotated out if their concentration is unknown, such processing is unnecessary upon using<br>
the invention because such concentrations are known.<br>
Temperature and pathlength correction algorithm. The following discussion<br>
provides an exemplary temperature and pathlength correction algorithm in accordance with<br>
the invention.<br>
1. Response function: residual (sample - buffer) about zero for regions where<br>
the analyte does not absorb.<br>
2. Residual as function of spectral range is inversely weighted by the spectral<br>
noise of the sample.<br>
3. Thousands of buffers collected at roughly 38°C are compared with the<br>
sample to match temperature. By using thousands of buffers, a good temperature match<br>
can be found.<br>
4. For each buffer tested, incremental pathlengths of water are tested to match<br>
pathlength of buffer in the sample. For example, to get a pathlength of .99 mm, the buffer<br>
being tested as a possible background is multiplied by 0.9900. For example, albumin<br>
protein from .95 mm to1 mm at 0.0005 mm steps is tested with each buffer.<br>
The following is a Matlab temperature/pathlength correction program for selected<br>
parameters that must be optimized for each analyte, such as pathlength, and regions for the<br>
response function:<br>

The resulting Spectra are clean and baseline resolved. The spectra are selected to<br>
cover physiological concentrations for each analyte.<br>
The following example illustrates the generation of a first basis set "Basis Set I."<br>
Example - Basis Set I<br>
near-IR absorbance features over the 1500 to 2500 nm spectral region are provided for<br>
water, albumin protein, globulin protein, triacetin, cholesterol, urea, and glucose with a 1<br>
mm pathlength. In addition, sample temperature effects are included along with instrument<br>
noise levels.<br>
Experimental: Spectra of the major constituents of serum were collected over<br>
their respective physiological ranges. Sample preparation consisted of dissolving dried,<br>
reagent grade solid samples in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 7.35. All speetra<br>
were collected on a NIRS 5000 in transmission mode, with a 1 mm path length infrasil<br>
quartz cell, with a 120 second equilibration period, at 38.0°C, with 64 averaged scans,<br>
done in quadruplicate. A single instrument was used for all data acquisition.<br>
Results and Discussion: Spectra are analyzed in order of decreasing absorbance<br>
changes in the two spectral windows from 2050.to 2350 nm"and 1550 to 1850 am. The<br>
first replicate is discarded in all cases due to a consistent variation in temperature caused by<br>
the instability of the NIRS 5000 spectrometer and photons heating the sample (data not<br>
included). The sample is in equilibrium by the second sample replicate.<br>
Water Spectra: The near-IR is dominated by three large water absorbance bands<br>
centered at 2500, 1950, and 1450 nm as presented in Fig. 4. The high absorbance limits<br>
analysis done in aqueous solution in the near-IR to three spectral regions. The region from<br>
23,50 to 2050 nm is referred to herein as the combination band region; the region from 1850<br>
to 1550 nm is referred to herein as the first overtone spectral region; and the region from<br>
1400 to 1100 nm is referred to as the second overtone spectral region.<br>
The NIRS spectrometer sets the gain and hence the dynamic range of the detector<br>
based upon the spectral region with the most light intensity reaching the detector. This is<br>
the second overtone spectral region for aqueous samples. However, the combination band<br>
region has the largest absorbance, followed by the first overtone region, and then the<br>
second overtone region. Due to the low absorbance of water in the 1300 nm region versus<br>
the 2200 nm region, a relatively small dynamic range is left for the 2200 nm region where<br>
glucose bands are the largest. Therefore, a 1500 nm long pass filter was employed which<br>
forces the NIRS system to set the gain based upon the first overtone spectral region.<br>
Hence, in the initial basis set no spectral information is provided for the second overtone<br>
region, optimum signal to noise levels are provided for the first overtone spectral region,<br>
and slightly degraded signal to noise levels are obtained for the combination bands. Among<br>
many modifications made to the NIRS system is an order sorter which allows a different<br>
gain setting for each of the three spectral regions during a single scan for the next basis data<br>
set.<br>
Temperature Effects on Water Spectra: All three water absorbance bands in the<br>
near-IR shift to higher frequency with increasing temperature. Buffer spectra collected<br>
from 38.2 to 43.0°C are presented in Fig. 5A. The instrument should be modified to collect<br>
lower temperature spectra. A slight broadening of the lines can be observed on each of the<br>
water absorbance band shoulders. Subtracting a spectrum of water collected at 38.2°C<br>
from spectra of water collected at higher temperatures reveals the magnitude and direction<br>
of the shift. Negative absorbance bands that increase with temperature are observed at<br>
2000 and 1480 nm. As the water bands shift to higher temperature, there is less water<br>
absorbance in these regions, so that subtracting out a water absorbance band from a lower<br>
temperature results in too much background being subtracted. Positive absorbance bands<br>
that correlate with increasing temperature are observed at 2300, 1890, and 1400 nm. With<br>
increasing temperature, the water absorbance increasingly moves into these spectral<br>
regions. Subtracting out the 38.2°C water spectrum does not subtract out enough in these<br>
regions.<br>
The large water absorbance, coupled with the temperature shift, greatly hinders<br>
near-IR analysis. Fig. 5B reveals that in the subtraction, no useful information is obtained<br>
where the raw absorbance is greater than 3.0 ± 0.1, indicating the limit of the dynamic<br>
range of the NIRS system. Therefore, the regions above 2460 nm and from 2010 to 1890<br>
nm result in no analytically useful information and may be discarded for data collected with<br>
a 1 mm pathlength. Information in these spectral regions may be obtained by adjusting the<br>
pathlength. Due to the water absorption, the width of the regions that need to be discarded<br>
increases as the pathlength analyzed increases. In addition, the temperature effects are seen<br>
to span the entire combination band region and first overtone spectral region. As will be<br>
shown, these changes in baseline are roughly equal in magnitude to the highly absorbing<br>
protein and much greater in magnitude than all other spectral analytes examined.<br>
Albumin Protein: After water and temperature effects, serum spectra are primarily<br>
composed of absorption from albumin protein which has a physiological range of 2.6 to<br>
7.9 g/dL. Albumin protein absorbance bands are difficult to see in the presence of water,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6A. Subtracting out a buffer spectrum results in protein absorbance peaks<br>
at 2285, 2170, 1730, and 1690 nm, as shown in Fig. 6B. Large negative absorption bands<br>
also appear in the resulting spectra where water absorbs. These bands are not primarily due<br>
to variation in temperature as a derivative of the water band would appear as seen in Fig.<br>
5B. The negative bands are due to displacement of water by albumin and scattering.<br>
A program, such as the MATLAB program described above, is used to determine<br>
the best buffer in terms of temperature and best calculated pathlength to be used as a<br>
background spectrum for subtraction. In Fig. 6B, the buffer and albumin in buffer spectra<br>
both had the same 1 mm fixed pathlength. Because albumin is present in the 1 to 12 g/dL<br>
range in this example and water is 100 g/dL, the albumin occupies a significant volume of<br>
the cell and less water is present per unit volume. A program was written that multiplies the<br>
water spectrum by a percentage that can be sequentially varied over a wide range. The<br>
optimum calculated pathlength for each albumin in buffer spectrum was determined by<br>
minimizing the sum of the absolute value of the residuals in locations where albumin does<br>
not absorb and temperature effects are at a minimum (2085 to 2077 and 1655 to 1640 nm).<br>
The residual in the overtone region was weighted twice as much to compensate for the<br>
higher noise in the combination band region. To further minimize temperature effects, all<br>
buffer spectra collected were run through this optimization to find the best buffer in terms<br>
of temperature matching with the sample. Each albumin in buffer spectrum was run<br>
through this algorithm independently.<br>
The results of subtracting the best buffer at the adjusted pathlength for each albumin<br>
spectrum are presented in Fig. 7. Additional albumin absorbance bands are now visible at<br>
2060 nm and 2335 nm. Expansion of the graph about the 2060 nm absorbance bands<br>
reveals increasing absorbance for each increase in albumin concentration. The albumin<br>
band centered at 2170 nm is more symmetrical than the one seen in Fig. 6B. The two<br>
peaks in the first overtone spectral region have a better baseline correction and now increase<br>
in absorption linearly with increasing concentration. However, negative absorbance bands<br>
are still evident where water absorbs at 2020 and 1870 nm. The region between 2000 and<br>
1900 nm is an artifact of the mathematical correction over a region where the absorbance is<br>
greater than 3 and the system does not respond. In addition, there is a large difference<br>
between 0 absorbance and the 1 g/dL albumin spectrum. This difference should be equal to<br>
the difference in absorbance from 1 to 2 g/dL. This offset can be reduced if the<br>
combination band region and the overtone region are treated individually. It should be<br>
pointed out that no baseline correction, smoothing, or scatter correction has been employed<br>
at this point.<br>
Globulin Protein: Physiological concentrations of globulin (0.7 to 8.1 g/dL) are<br>
less absorbing in the near-IR than albumin. Straight subtraction of the phosphate buffer<br>
allows the same peaks to be observed that are seen in albumin protein, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
The temperature and pathlength correction algorithm discussed above was run with exactly<br>
the same parameters as for albumin and the same additional extra peaks were found, as<br>
shown on Fig. 9. Overlaying the albumin and globulin spectra reveals that the globulin<br>
absorbance band centered at 2170 nm is slightly broader than that of albumin protein.<br>
The calculated pathlengths required for the background subtraction from each of the<br>
spectra are presented in Fig. 10. For albumin, the correction is linear with increasing<br>
concentration, but has a y-axis intercept of 0.996 mm. This is consistent with the poor<br>
baseline observed in Fig. 7. The corrections for globulin are also linear, but greater<br>
corrections are required per mg/dL analyte. This is consistent with the scattering tendencies<br>
of globulin. The y-axis intercept is 1.00, consistent with the excellent background<br>
subtraction.<br>
Triglycerides: Triacetin is used to simulate triglycerides. The physiological range<br>
of triacetin is 50 to 450 mg/dL. The temperature and pathlength correction algorithm is<br>
again employed, but different regions are used in determining the minimum residual (2420<br>
to 2440, 2080 to 2090, and 1575 to 1635, weighted 1:5:20). Six triacetin absorbance<br>
bands result centered at 2320, 2250, 2130, 1760, 1715, and 1675 nm, as shown on Fig.<br>
11. The resulting pathlengths required for correction are linear with concentration, but<br>
much smaller deviations from 1 mm result due to the lower concentration of triacetin versus<br>
protein in serum, as shown on Fig. 10. The signal levels of the smaller triacetin<br>
absorbance bands approach the noise level of the spectrometer.<br>
Urea: Twelve urea in buffer spectra were collected. Due to the small physiological<br>
concentration of urea (6 to 123 mg/dL), the algorithm used to optimize the background by<br>
changing the effective pathlength of the buffer subtracted fails because no significant Figs.<br>
of water are displaced. No temperature matching algorithm is employed, but buffer spectra<br>
collected with each sample are used. A straight background subtraction followed by a two<br>
point baseline correction (2094 to 2106 and 2320 to 2332 nm) was performed and is<br>
presented in Fig. 12. A single absorbance band is present centered at 2190 nm. No<br>
overtone peak is present. This is consistent with this absorption being related to N-H,<br>
whereas all of the other analyses have O-H fundamental vibrations. Only four spectra are<br>
presented due to large baseline drifts that obscure the linearity of the additional spectra.<br>
Higher concentration samples can be run to obtain a higher S/N and cleaner spectra,<br>
although the same resulting basis set is obtained.<br>
Glucose: A complete glucose in buffer study was performed over the combination<br>
and first overtone spectral region of which a subset is presented here. Glucose was<br>
examined from 30 to 600 mg/dL (also from 0 to 5000 mg/dL) to cover the physiological as<br>
well as hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic levels of glucose. A straight subtraction of buffer<br>
from glucose in buffer shows absorbance bands centered at 2326, 2272, 1800, 2150,<br>
1730, and 1590 nm, as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
Conclusions: Consistent with theory, for all analytes, the combination band<br>
spectral region yields larger absorbance than the first overtone spectral region. However,<br>
longer pathlengths quickly degrade the signal to noise level in the combination band region<br>
due to the large water absorbance, whereas the spectral quality in the first overtone spectral<br>
region should increase with small millimeter increases in pathlength. The absorbance bands<br>
in the region of glucose absorbance in decreasing order of absorbance are water,<br>
temperature effects, albumin protein, globulin protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, and<br>
glucose. While every analyte analyzed absorbs more than glucose and over the same<br>
general spectral region, every analyte has a distinct absorbance signature. In principle, the<br>
serum spectra or the noninvasive spectra, can be deconvoluted.<br>
* * *<br>
The invention contemplates the generation of additional basis sets, such that<br>
substantially all interfering components are identified and factored into the spectroscopic<br>
analysis.<br>
The following example illustrates the generation of a second basis set "Basis Set<br>
II."<br>
Example - Basis Set II<br>
A study was rerun on dried, crushed, and pressed solid samples to give absorbance<br>
spectra with no water. A second basis set was collected based upon spectra of solid or neat<br>
components of human serum. The resulting absorbance spectra show the combination,<br>
first, and second overtone absorbance bands. In addition, for a given component the<br>
relative absorbance between regions may be compared. Combined, another method of<br>
wavelength selection is made available.<br>
Experimental: Pure component spectra of the liquid form of water (pH 7.35, 0.1<br>
M phosphate buffer 38.0 ± 0.2°C), triacetin, and lactic acid were collected. Albumin,<br>
globulin, cholesterol, urea, and glucose exist as a solid in their pure state. . For these<br>
analytes, each was individually ground with a mortal and pestle to a fine powder in the<br>
absence of potassium bromide. The powder was then compressed into a transparent pellet<br>
in a specially designed press that fits into the NIRS 5000 transmission module. Four<br>
replicates of each component were then obtained in the transmission mode. The pathlength<br>
of each analyte was not controlled.<br>
Results and Discussion: The raw absorbance spectra for water, albumin,<br>
globulin, cholesterol, triacetin, urea, glucose, and lactic acid are presented in Fig. 14.<br>
Because the pathlength of each pellet was not controlled, the relative absorbance between<br>
components can not be compared. The relative absorbance between frequencies for a given<br>
analyte can be compared. The large baseline offsets are due to the thickness of the sample<br>
and resulting total light throughput. This plot is included to show the total absorbance of<br>
each analyte relative to the dynamic range of the NIRS 5000.<br>
For each component in Fig. 14, the minimum absorbance was subtracted out and<br>
the resulting spectra was normalized to 1 absorbance unit, as shown in Fig. 15. The<br>
resulting full scale plots make it easier to compare absorbance as a function of frequency<br>
and differences between components. For all three spectral regions, i.e. combination (2050<br>
to 2350 nm), first (1550 to 1850 nm), and second overtone (1100 to 1400 nm), the<br>
absorbance bands are observed to be distinct. In principle, each component can be<br>
deconvoluted. It should be noted that when interacting with water, these absorbance bands<br>
may shift and broaden. Comparing with the aqueous absorbance from Basis Set I (above)<br>
reveals the absorbance bands of the neat or solid water (140), albumin (141), globulin<br>
(142), and triacetin (143) to be in the same location with the same widths. Both urea (144)<br>
and glucose (145) reveal additional resolution of peaks that have broadened and merged in<br>
the presence of water.<br>
Several key spectral signatures emerge from this Example. First, the combination<br>
band region contains absorbance for each of the individual analytes. These absorbance are<br>
in every case more intense than those in the first and second overtone spectral regions.<br>
Cholesterol (146) absorbance drops off rapidly in this region as does triacetin. Neither<br>
interfere significantly with the glucose absorbance band centered at 2150 nm. The only<br>
interference is from water, albumin, and globulin which are shown in the Example -<br>
Linearity Study (below) to be removable by simple subtraction.<br>
In the first overtone spectral region every component has an absorbance band except<br>
urea with its N-H bonds. Here the intensities of the absorbance bands range from 15% to<br>
50% that of the corresponding combination band absorbance. It should be recognized that<br>
these values are for a fixed pathlength and can be adjusted based upon total pathlength.<br>
The second overtone spectral region has absorbance bands for every component<br>
examined, but the relative absorbance are the smallest, as shown on Fig. 16. The glucose<br>
band (145) seen here is very difficult to see in the presence of water (140).<br>
Conclusions: Each of the three regions contains information about every analyte<br>
with the exception of urea in the first overtone spectral region. The absorbance bands are<br>
highly overlapped and are generally less intense at higher frequencies. The absorbance<br>
bands are all distinct.<br>
* * *<br>
The following example illustrates the generation of a third basis set "Basis Set III."<br>
Example - Basis Set III<br>
The first basis set was repeated with no edge filter present to allow comparison of<br>
all spectral ranges. The first Example above used a 1500 nm long pass filter to force the<br>
NIRS spectrometer to gain range on the 1700 nm spectral region. This Example could be<br>
repeated with increased optical pathlengths to yield higher signal to noise levels in the first<br>
and second overtone spectral regions.<br>
The following example illustrates the generation of a fourth basis set "Basis Set<br>
IV."<br>
Example - Basis Set IV<br>
It is necessary to measure interactions of molecules in solution. In this Example, a<br>
serum data set is collected.<br>
Data Sets: The first data set consists of spectra of glucose dissolved in a 0.1 M<br>
phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 7.35. Reagent grade glucose was weighed and diluted to a<br>
known volume with the 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Spectra were collected in the<br>
transmission mode with a 1 mm quartz cell using the NIRS 5000 spectrometer over the<br>
range of 1100 to 2500 nm with readings taken every 2 nm. A 1500 nm long pass filter was<br>
placed before the sample to force the NIRS spectrometer to set the gain on the peak signal at<br>
1600 nm. Before and after every sample, 7 spectra of the 0.1 M phosphate buffer were<br>
collected. A total of 64 glucose (aq) samples were collected with 7 sequential replicates of<br>
each sample. The glucose samples covered a dynamic range of approximately 20 to 600<br>
mg/dL. All samples were maintained at 38.0 ± 0.2°C.<br>
The second data set consists of serum samples prepared by Western States Plasma.<br>
Each serum sample was analyzed using a standard SMAC analysis yielding concentrations<br>
for calcium, ionized calcium (calculated), phosphorus, glucose, uric acid, urea nitrogen<br>
(BUN), creatinine, creatinine/BUN ratio, total protein, albumin, globulin, A/G ratio, total<br>
bilirubin, ALT, ALP, LD (LDH), AST, GGT, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon<br>
dioxide, triglycerides, and cholesterol. To extend the dynamic range and level the<br>
concentration distribution, reagent grade urea and glucose were quantitatively added to the<br>
serum samples. The NIRS 5000 spectrometer was used in the fashion described above<br>
with the same wavelength region, pathlength, temperature control, and long pass filter. A<br>
0.1 M phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 7.35 was run before and after each serum sample."<br>
A total of 196 serum samples were collected with 4 sequential replicates of each sample.<br>
The glucose analyte covered a dynamic range of approximately 20 to 600 mg/dL.<br>
Experimental: Glucose is determined in each data set using PLS regression<br>
analysis. The data sets are broken up into calibration and prediction keeping all replicate<br>
spectra together. A data point was originally collected every 2 nm from 1100 to 2500 nm.<br>
Additional data sets are formed from this data set by keeping every other point, every 3 rd<br>
point, every 4th point, ..., to every 32nd point. PLS calibration models and predictions are<br>
then determined using 1 to 10 PLS factors.<br>
Results and Discussion: For each resolution, the resulting standard error of<br>
calibration (SEC) and standard error of prediction (SEP) is determined for 1 to 10 PLS<br>
factors, as shown on Fig. 17. Here, selection of the optimum number of factors needs to<br>
be achieved. As different ranges need to be compared, differences in the number of PLS<br>
factors employed can lead to erroneous conclusions. Statistical approaches to determining<br>
the optimum number of factors have failed. Because" the SEP does not increase as the<br>
system is over-modeled, and further because the SEC and SEP yield similar results with 10<br>
factors, it was decided for the purposes of this Example only to compare standard errors<br>
from range to range using the results obtained with ten PLS factors.<br>
Ten spectral ranges are analyzed in both the glucose in water and glucose in serum<br>
data sets. These are summarized in Table 1 below. Ranges 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 correspond to<br>
the full width at zero height of the six glucose absorbance bands isolated in the near-IR.<br>
Ranges 4 and 8 splice together regions 1 to 3 and 5 to 7, respectively. Ranges 9 and 10<br>
expand regions 4 and 8 into regions of increasing water absorbance, increasing noise, and<br>
no additional glucose information.<br>
Clearly, the wider spectral region that incorporates more glucose information (and water<br>
and temperature) results in a lower standard error at any resolution than any of the three<br>
individual glucose absorbance bands.<br>
The nominal resolution of the NIRS spectrometer is 10 nm for the standard 0.040"<br>
exit slit used in this Example. Still, the standard error is observed to increase slightly as the<br>
resolution degrades from 2 to 10 nm. This is due to the manner in which the data sets were<br>
created from the original 2 nm resolution data set. For instance, in the 6 nm resolution data<br>
set generated, every third spectral point is kept. This means that two-thirds of the data are<br>
discarded. The discarded data has glucose, water, and temperature signal. In addition, by<br>
keeping these extra points, the effective noise is decreased by signal averaging. In as much<br>
as the true resolution of the NIRS 5000 is 10 nm, 100% of the slope observed on the SE<br>
vs. resolution graph is due to this systematic error. In addition, the same slope is observed<br>
from 10 to 32 nm resolution.<br>
The original data set with points every two manometers was again broken down<br>
into data sets with resolution ranging from 2 to 32 nm at 2 nm intervals. This time, the data<br>
was averaged instead of just discarding extra points. For example, at 6 nm resolution<br>
points at 1100, 1102, and 1104 nm were averaged to a single point. The next point<br>
averaged the data points at 1106, 1108, and 1110 nm. The PLS analysis was then repeated<br>
and the standard errors with the tenth factor determined, as shown in Fig. 18. The increase<br>
in standard error observed with degrading resolution is observed to range from 5 to 10<br>
mg/dL standard error as opposed to 5 to 25 mg/dL standard error from 2 to 32 nm<br>
resolution. Clearly, the failure to average the data points results in an increase of the slope<br>
of standard error versus resolution. While the standard error roughly doubles from 2 to 32<br>
nm resolution, the data indicates that for a glucose in water solution, the acceptable<br>
resolution may be 32 nm or more. This makes chemical sense in as much as the narrowest<br>
absorbance band in this Example is 54 nm wide. In must be pointed out that there are no<br>
spectral interferences in this Example. Therefore, the actual acceptable resolution can only<br>
degrade from this resolution.<br>
2°C for the first overtone region, for data sets generated at 2 to 32 nm resolution<br>
using averaged data, the increase in standard error with degrading resolution is greatly<br>
reduced, as shown on Fig. 19. In addition, for this spectral region, less than ten points are<br>
retained at resolutions greater than 16 nm. The PLS algorithm used only operates on as<br>
many factors as there are data points. If queried for standard errors with additional factors,<br>
the standard error for the number of factors equal to the number of points available is "<br>
generated. Because the standard errors continue to decrease with an increasing number of<br>
factors in this Example (see Fig. 17), the comparison of standard errors for various<br>
resolutions using ten PLS factors is not valid. A direct comparison of standard errors at<br>
degrading resolution for the 1587 to 1754 nm spectral region with six PLS factors is<br>
presented in Fig. 20. The increased standard error observed with degrading resolution is<br>
now not observed with resolutions under 15 nm. This is a true comparison of standard<br>
errors for this spectral region. The results in Fig. 18 for the 2078 to 2366 nm spectral<br>
region are still valid due to its large range which contains ten or more points up to 30 nm<br>
resolution.<br>
Glucose in Serum: The SEC and SEP plots versus resolution for glucose in the<br>
serum study for the ten different spectral regions are provided in Figs. 21 to 30. The<br>
results are generally the same as for glucose in water.<br>
The combination band region is analyzed first. Range 1 with the largest glucose<br>
absorbance band yields the lowest standard errors for a region isolating a single glucose<br>
absorbance band, as shown on Fig. 21. Ranges 2 and 3 yield larger standard errors and<br>
have smaller glucose absorbance bands with a decreased signal to noise level, as shown on<br>
Figs. 22 and 23. Analysis of ranges 2 and 3 at degraded resolutions is limited by the<br>
number of data points present in each range. Range 4 which couples the first three regions<br>
demonstrates the lowest standard errors, as shown on Fig. 24. Again, the averaging of<br>
points reduces the increase in standard error with degrading resolution. The increase in<br>
standard error from 35 to 50 mg/dL observed as resolution degrades from 2 to 30 nm is<br>
entirely due to the loss of information in extracting rather than averaging data points. While<br>
the standard errors are higher than in the glucose in water Example, this Example<br>
demonstrates that even in the presence of all of the spectral interferences, except skin and<br>
blood cells, the resolution is essentially not an effect until after a resolution of 30 nm. This<br>
is the same result as for glucose in water. The number of PLS factors incorporated is not<br>
an issue due to the fact that 10 points are present even at 30 nm resolution. Range 9<br>
incorporates all of range 4 and extends past where glucose absorbs at both higher and lower<br>
frequencies, as shown in Fig. 29. No resolution effect on standard error is observed from<br>
2 to 32 nm.<br>
The effects of resolution in the first overtone spectral region are more difficult to<br>
interpret due to decreased signal to noise and the narrower spectral ranges chosen. Range 5<br>
has the largest glucose absorbance band in the overtone spectral window and results in the<br>
lowest standard errors. Ranges 6 and 7 were shown to have very poor signal to noise<br>
levels for glucose in water (not presented). The standard errors are essentially mean<br>
centered prediction values, as shown on Figs. 26 and 27. The effect is worsened at<br>
degrading resolution due to the number of points in each spectral range. Range 8 reveals<br>
real glucose predictions, as shown on Fig. 28. This range was reanalyzed with the<br>
averaged rather than the selected data, see Fig. 31. Using ten PLS factors, the increasing<br>
standard error with degrading resolution observed is virtually identical to the nonaveraged<br>
data due to the number of points present in the data. This is shown by comparing the<br>
standard errors with only six PLS factors (6 points present at 30 nm resolution). No<br>
resolution effect is observed until a resolution of 20 nm. Range 10 which expands to<br>
higher and lower frequencies from range 8 has 10 data points present at 30 nm resolution<br>
and shows no resolution effect until 20 nm, as shown in Fig. 30.<br>
Conclusions: The glucose in water data set has sufficient signal to noise to<br>
determine glucose with the specifications required. The rise in standard error for the<br>
narrow glucose absorbance bands with degrading resolution is not real. It is partially the<br>
result of selecting the points rather than averaging the points to generate new data sets. In<br>
addition, the new data sets did not contain enough data points to compare analysis of 2 nm<br>
resolution data and 32 nm resolution data with ten PLS factors. Resolution effects may be<br>
addressed by using fewer PLS factors in this comparison or by using larger spectral<br>
ranges. For both methods, the resolution effects are minimal to 30 nm in the combination<br>
band region and 15 nm in the first overtone spectral window.<br>
Because it is preferred to get the highest signal to noise ratio possible from the<br>
instrument, it is acceptable to have 30 nm resolution. That is, by having less (but,<br>
nonetheless, acceptable) resolution, e.g. by having 30 nm resolution instead of 10 nm<br>
resolution, the instrument captures more signal relative to noise. Thus, even though the<br>
resolution is coarser, more information is contained in signal generated by the instrument.<br>
As a result, the resolution selected in the preferred embodiment of the invention provides a<br>
more accurate picture of the spectra, even though the instrument has coarser resolution.<br>
This is because there is a higher signal to noise ratio at the resolution required. In contrast,<br>
if extra resolution were available in the instrument, but there was a lower signal to noise<br>
ratio, less information would be available for processing by the basis sets.<br>
In the Example, the glucose in serum data sets resulted in roughly three times the<br>
standard error as in the glucose data set. Again, analysis is limited to either large spectral<br>
windows or to comparisons with fewer PLS factors for narrower ranges. In the<br>
combination band spectral region, the increase in standard error observed with degrading<br>
resolution is minimal to 30 nm resolution. In the first overtone spectral window, the slope<br>
to standard error versus resolution is minimal to 20 nm resolution. These results are<br>
virtually identical to those generated in the glucose in water study. The effects of the<br>
proteins, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea, salts, and minor organic constituents is observed<br>
not to effect the required resolution.<br>
* * *<br>
Example - Basis Set V<br>
It is necessary to measure effect of scattering of whole blood cells. This basis set is<br>
generated as follows:<br>
• Collect blood data set in transmission and as diffuse reflectance.<br>
• Repeat component extraction.<br>
• Couple in scatter correction<br>
• Deconvolve (see deconvolution discussion below.).<br>
Example - Basis Set VI<br>
It is necessary to measure the effect of skin. Animal studies are performed and all<br>
prior analysis techniques are repeated. Noninvasive studies can be viewed as extensions of<br>
the basis set.<br>
* * *<br>
Uses of Basis Sets.<br>
Chemical and physical knowledge of a system arc required for such factors as:<br>
• Intelligent wavelength selection, e.g. knowledge of the location and degree of<br>
interferences of each analyte.<br>
• Interpretation of noise levels as a function of region.<br>
• Interpretation of signal levels for each analytes as a function of wavelength.<br>
• Selection of optimal signal to noise regions for each analyte.<br>
Resolution specifications for an instrument implementation of the invention are set<br>
forth above. The number of analog-to-digital (A/D) bits required to provide appropriate<br>
instrument resolution can be calculated from noninvasive spectra and glucose intensities<br>
(absorbance). For this determination, it is necessary to know the maximum intensity of the<br>
whole system and the intensity of glucose at the required standard error. If the maximum<br>
intensity of the sample is 10 to the negative absorbants unit, it is only necessary calculate<br>
the intensity of the body scan, including all absorbants. To determine the intensity of<br>
glucose, the required standard error is 9 mg/dL. The intensity of glucose and water, and<br>
the intensity of water is used (as described above) to calculate the intensity of the glucose<br>
and water minus the intensity of water. This results in a value for the intensity of glucose.<br>
Once the intensity of glucose is determined, it is then necessary to determine the change in<br>
intensity of glucose, e.g. by drawing in a base line to the peak, and plotting the change in<br>
intensity of glucose versus glucose concentration. This provides a best fit of, the data that<br>
can be fitted to a line to calculate the change in intensity at 9 mg/dL. Once this value is<br>
obtained, the ratio of this value to maximum intensity of the glucose is readily calculated.<br>
This ratio defines the number of bits that are required in the system for analog-to-digital<br>
conversion. For example, if the ratio is 50,000, then a 16 bit A/D is required because<br>
sufficient quantization must be provided to avoid aliasing problems. Thus, the basis set is<br>
useful in defining instrument parameters.<br>
Interpretation of multivariate results. Multivariate results are difficult to validate.<br>
Standard errors must correlate with basis set information. If noisy regions are added, the<br>
signal to noise ratio decreases. It is therefore necessary to correlate standard errors with the<br>
signal to noise ratio.<br>
With regard to the removal of second, third, ... order light in a grating based<br>
spectrometer, a long pass filter is required. The basis set dictates the specifications of the<br>
filter.<br>
With regard to the removal of scatter, such determinations are based upon refractive<br>
index change. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the basis sets remove scatter<br>
and temperature effects. This step is repeated for additional analytes, and the reduced<br>
spectra are further processed using multivariate approaches.<br>
Deconvolution of noninvasive spectra. The partial deconvolution reduces the rank<br>
of first temperature and water, then proteins, then organic constituents. The resulting<br>
spectra can then be fed into the multivariate approaches. However, the reduced dynamic<br>
range of signals forces PLS to lock in on smaller analytes, such as urea and glucose,<br>
instead of water and temperature.<br>
There are a limited number of interferences for glucose in the near-IR. The major<br>
interferences have convenient breaks in concentration. The largest concentrations / effects<br>
are temperature and water. Processing should remove the Refractive index, which is on the<br>
order of 100 g/dL.<br>
Large concentration gaps exists between water and the proteins. Iterative<br>
deconvolution can be used to take advantage of this fact.<br>
Albumin and globulin proteins are on the order of 1 to 7 g/dL. These interferants<br>
are easily identified and removed by spectral subtraction or rotation.<br>
Example - Linearity<br>
Introduction: The basis set is used to determine the location and intensity of each<br>
of the major species interfering with glucose. It also demonstrates that for a given<br>
component, the absorbance increases linearly with,increasing concentration. In this<br>
Example, it is shown that the absorbance of multiple components is the sum of the<br>
individual components, as assumed by Beer"s law. This is critical to the herein described<br>
approach of using spectral subtraction of chemical information to enhance the signal to<br>
noise level of glucose.<br>
. Experimental: Spectra were collected in quadruplicate with a NIRS 5000<br>
spectrometer configured in the transmission mode with a 1 mm pathlength quartz sample<br>
cell. All samples are reagent grade and were prepared in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH<br>
7.35 and spectra were collected at 38.0 ± 0.2°C.<br>
Six single analyte solutions were prepared: 4000 &amp; 8000 mg/dL albumin, 2000 &amp;<br>
4000 mg/dL globulin, and 200 &amp; 400 mg/dL triacetin. Eight additional samples were<br>
prepared consisting of all possible permutations and combinations of the above six sample<br>
concentrations. For example, one sample consisted of 8000 mg/dL albumin, 2000 mg/dL<br>
globulin, and 200 mg/dL triacetin.<br>
Results and Discussion: Three spectra of water, 8000 mg/dL albumin, 2000<br>
mg/dL globulin and 200 mg/dL triacetin appear primarily as water absorbance bands, as<br>
shown on Fig. 32. Subtraction of the water with the same algorithm used in the basis data<br>
set that attempts to match pathlength and temperature effects (discussed above) was<br>
employed to minimize the residual about zero absorbance over the spectral ranges 1640 to<br>
1655 nm and 2077 to 2085 nm, as shown in Fig. 33. Results of incomplete temperature<br>
and pathlength subtraction dominate in the regions surrounding 1890 to 2010 nm where no<br>
signal results due to large water absorbance. The resulting spectra show the six dominant<br>
protein absorbance bands centered at 1690, 1730, 2060, 2170, 2285, and 2335 nm.<br>
Spectra of the single analyte albumin samples are shown in Fig. 34. The 8000 •<br>
mg/dL albumin peaks are nearly exactly double the 4000 mg/dL albumin peaks indicating<br>
that Beer"s law is holding. The average of the 8000 mg/dL albumin spectra was subtracted<br>
from the spectra in Fig. 33 to yield the spectra shown in Fig. 35. Overlaid with this are the<br>
2000 mg/dL globulin spectra. Clearly, the basic shape of the globulin spectra is discernible<br>
after subtraction of the 100,000 mg/dL (100 g/dL) water and the 8000 mg/dL albumin. The<br>
difference is the sum of the 200 mg/dL triacetin and baseline drift.<br>
Spectra of the single analyte globulin samples are shown in Fig. 36. The 4000<br>
mg/dL globulin peaks (260, 261, 262) are nearly exactly double the 2000 mg/dL globulin<br>
peaks (263, 264). Again, the average of the 2000 mg/dL globulin spectra is subtracted<br>
from the spectra shown in Fig. 33 to yield the spectra in Fig. 37. Overlaid with this are the<br>
standard 200 mg/dL triacetin spectra. Once again, the 200 mg/dL triacetin peaks centered at<br>
1675, 1715, 1760, 2130, 2250, and 2320 mg/dL can be seen after the subtraction of<br>
100,000 mg/dL water, 8000 mg/dL albumin, and the 2000 mg/dL globulin. Unknown<br>
concentrations may be subtracted by rotation.<br>
Conclusions: For a relatively simple mixture, subtraction of the high<br>
concentration water, albumin, and globulin results in spectra of triacetin. Clearly, small<br>
errors in temperature and pathlength correction propagate into large errors of baseline for<br>
the lower concentration analytes. It is also possible that the error in subtraction may be due<br>
to scattering. To correct for this, a standard multiple scatter correction algorithm may be<br>
used. Clearly, straight subtraction can yield spectra that visually appear to yield higher<br>
signal to noise for the lower concentration analytes.<br>
NOTE: the only two species in serum that have higher near-IR absorption than<br>
glucose that were not included in this Example are cholesterol and urea.<br>
* * *<br>
In applying the invention, direct spectral subtraction is replaced with iterative<br>
subtraction, based upon regions of minimal or defined absorbance of remaining analytes.<br>
In another, equally preferred embodiment of the invention, another concentration gap may<br>
taken advantage of for purposes of isolating the analyte vis-a-vis interferants. Two<br>
presently preferred approaches includes:<br>
• Analyze with multivariate techniques because the dynamic range of interferences<br>
and glucose is the same; and<br>
• Further removal of triglycerides, cholesterol, urea by deconvolution/ subtraction.<br>
One approach to generating basis sets is iterative. For example, within a sample,<br>
after subtracting water, a determination of albumin and globulin is made. Once albumin<br>
and globulin are determined, and there is knowledge of water concentration, the albumin<br>
and globulin may be again removed, only this time more accurately. This iterative process<br>
proceeds to some predetermined limit of precision, and then triglycerides and cholesterol<br>
are integrated into the analysis.<br>
Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred<br>
embodiment, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be<br>
substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
