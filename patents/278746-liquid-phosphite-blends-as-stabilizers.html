I claim the benefit under Title 35, United States Code, § 119 to U.S. Provisional Application Number 60/815,819, filed 06/20/2006 entitled LIQUID PHOSPHITE BLENDS AS STABILIZERS.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel mixtures of phosphite antioxidants for polymeric resin compositions. It also relates to stabilized resin compositions and stabilizer concentrates comprising said novel liquid mixtures of phosphite antioxidants.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Organic phosphites (aka phosphorous acid esters) are known in the art as secondary antioxidants for polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, and elastomers. Examples of such known phosphites are given in H. Zweifel (Ed) Plastics Additives Handbook, 5th edition, Hanser Publishers, Munich 2000. One of the most widely used organic phosphites is trisnonylphenyl phosphite (TNPP), which is a liquid at room temperature. There is, however, a need to replace TNPP owing to the alleged estrogenicity of nonylphenol. Furthermore, as TNPP is a liquid at ambient conditions, there is a need to replace it with a phosphite that is also a liquid at ambient conditions.<br>
Phosphite stabilizer blends, both liquid and solid, are known in the art.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,948,801 discloses stabilizing compositions comprising at least one triaryl phosphite, trialkyl phosphite or mixtures thereof and at least one modified lignin, the weight ratio of the phosphite to modified lignin being from 97/3 to 10/90. The modified lignins are produced by heat treating lignins in the presence of a nucleophile, such that a portion of the original guaiacyl structures are converted to catechols via a demethylation reaction. Elastomers are said to be protected against atmospheric degradation by the addition<br>
.. thereto of 0.01 to 5.0 parts by weight per 100 parts of elastomer of the stabilizing composition.<br>

(Structure  Removed) wherein R4, R5, and R$ are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C1-C6 alkyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and isomers thereof, e.g., isopropyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, and the like, provided that at least one of R4, R5, and R6 is not hydrogen.

structure:<br>

Similarly, in another preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a stabilized composition comprising:<br>
(A)	a polymeric resin, and<br>
(B)	a stabilizing amount of a blend of at least two different phosphites of the structure<br>
(Structure  Removed) wherein Ri, R2, and R3 are independently selected alkylated aryl groups of the<br>

(Structure  Removed) wherein R1, R2, and R3 are hvkpendently .selected alkylated aryl groups;<br>
wherein the aryl moieties of the alkylated aryl groups present in the phosphites are independently selected from the group consisting of aromatize moieties of from 6 to 18 carbon atoms;<br>
wherein each aryl group of the alkylated aryl groups is substituted with at least one alkyl group of from 1 to 18 carbon atoms; and<br>
wherein said blend is a liquid at ambient conditions.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for stabilizing a thermoplastic resin or elastomer comprising the step of adding to said thermoplastic resin or elastomer a stabilizing amount of a composition comprising a blend of at least two different phosphites of the structure<br>
(Structure  Removed) wherein R1, R2, and R3, are independently selected alkylated aryl groups of the<br>
structure:<br>
(Structure  Removed) wherein R4, R5, and R6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C1-C6 alkyl, provided that at least one of R4, R5, and R5 is not hydrogen ; and<br>
wherein said blend is a liquic at ambient «,: Add Ions.<br>
In the above-described embodiments, it is preferred that the blends comprise at least three different phosphites of the described structure, even more preferred that they comprise at least four such different phosphites.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method whereby the liquid phosphite mixtures can be made in the direct reaction of a phosphorus trihalide and a corresponding mixture of alkyl substituted phenols, with or without catalyst. The reaction products obtained as a result of this process can be used as is, in lieu of mixing the liquid phosphite blends of the present invention, without the need for further modification. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for synthesizing a liquid mixture of at least two liquid phosphites of the structure:<br>
(Structure  Removed) wherein Ri, R2, and R3 are independently selected alkylated aryl groups; wherein the method comprises:<br>
(A)	alkylating a phenolic compound with an alkene in the presence of an acid catalyst;<br>
(B)	separating the resulting alkylated phenol from the catalyst; and<br>
(C)	reacting PZ3, wherein Z is a halogen, with the resulting mixture, which comprises from about 5 to about 95  weight percent of a solid p -alkylated phenol and, correspondingly, from about 95 to about 5 weight percent of a solid o,p-dialkylated phenol. By "phenolic compound" is meant ah aryl' moiety,' e.g., phenyl', having at least one OH group, and optionally further substituted with one or more additional groups that will not adversely affect its desirable properties, e.g., cresol, xylenol, and the like.<br>
Thus, the preferred means for preparing the aryl phosphite stabilizers that are used in the practice of the present invention is by reacting a phosphorus trihalide, PZ3, e.g., phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus tribromide, with the appropriate alkylated phenol mixture.<br>
The reaction between the alkylated phenol mixture and the PZ3 may be carried out with or without the use of a solvent. Typically, the PZ3 can be added to the alkylated phenol mixture or the alkylated phenol mixture can be added to PZ3. Preferably, the PZ3 is added to the alkylated phenol mixture while maintaining a temperature of about 5 to 150EC. This is followed by holding the reaction mixtures for a period of 1 to 10 hours. During this period of time, HZ gas will evolve, the removal of which can be aided by either reducing the pressure or sweeping an inert gas such' as nitiogen over tui; reaction mixture. A typical reduced pressure is 50 mbar. For HC1, for example, this step will be performed until the total CI content is less than 50 ppm. Typically, any unreacted alkylated phenol can then be removed<br>
-   from the reaction mixture by further raising the temperature to up to 230EC, preferably about 200EC, while maintaining a vacuum of 5 mbar.<br>
Desirable solvents that may be utilized are neutral solvents. Typical solvents are toluene, heptane, xylene, methylene .chloride, chloroform, and benzene. Preferred solvents are methylene chloride, heptane, or xylene.<br>
Thus, preferably, the liquid phosphite blends of the present invention are obtained in a direct chemical reaction, in which the ratio of the alkyl substituted phenols is adjusted accordingly. A schematic of the reaction method is as follows.<br>
(Structure  Removed) wherein m = 3 and n = 2.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, all of the above R groups are tert-butyl groups or tert.-pentyl groups and, thus, the compounds of such a blend are selected from the group consisting of tris 4-tert-butyl phenyl phosphite, tris 2,4-di-tert-butyl phenyl phosphite, bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl phosphite, bis (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4-tert-butylphenyl phosphite, tris 4-tert-pentyl phenyl phosphite, tris 2,4-di-tert-pentyl phenyl phosphite, bis(4-tert-pentylphenyl)-2,4-di-tert-pentylphenyl phosphite, and bis (2,4-di-tert-pentylphenyl)-4-tert-pentylphenyl phosphite.<br>
As noted above, it is a feature of the present invention that the mixture of phosphite antioxidants is in liquid physical form at room temperature. This, is clearly surprising, given that the prior art teaches several examples where a mixture of phosphite stabilizers, that by themselves are solids, is a solid, toa5 at room temperature (cf. JP 59030842; WO 9303092; CA 2,464,551). In the present invention, the blends of phosphite stabilizers form a liquid even though the individual components are known as solids.<br>
Thus, in the schematic shown above, the liquid phosphite blend can be comprised of four main phosphite components, tris 4-tert-butyl phenyl phosphite, tris 2,4-di-tert-butyl<br>
phenyl phosphite, bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl phosphite, and bis (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4-tert-butylphenyl phosphite. However, it is known in the art, for example, that the component tris tert-butylphenyl phosphite has a melting point of 75-76EC (Kosalopoff, Organic Phosphorus Compounds, Wiley Interscience, Vol. 5, pg 163). Likewise, tris 2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl phosphite is a solid known in the art, whose mp =181-184EC (Aldrich catalog #441791). Similarly, bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl phosphite has a melting point of 63-65EC. Likewise, bis (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4-tert-butylphenyl phosphite has a melting point of 100-103EC.<br>
Transesterification processes such as those disclosed in Hechenbleikner et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,056,823, which is incorporated herein by reference, may also be employed. Specifically, the process described by Hechenbleikner et al. involves transesterifying a triaryl phosphite with a monohydroxy hydrocarbon in the presence of a small but catalytically effective amount of a metal alcoholate or metal phenolate.<br>
To avoid contamination, the alcoholate of the particular alcohol to be transesterified is employed. Instead of employing a preformed alcoholate, the alcoholate can be formed in situ by adding the metal, e.g., sodium, potassium or lithium to the alcohol prior to adding the triaryl phosphite. The mono alcohol and triaryl phosphite are reacted in the mol ratio of three mols of the alcohol to one mol of the triaryl phosphite.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for making a suitable mixture of alkylated phenols. Thus, reaction of phenol (or cresol or already alkylated phenol, e.g., p-tert-butylphenol) with, preferably, a lower alkene (C2-C6, more preferably C4-C5) using any of many known catalysts (acid clays, cationic ion exchange resins, BrOnsted acids e.g.<br>
sulfuric acid, Lewis acids, e.g., BF3) gives a mixed alkylated phenol, the composition of which can be modified by varying the degree of alkylation, temperature, and the like.<br>
The invention, moreover, also relates to providing a mixed alkylated phenol feedstock (for the synthesis of said phosphite blends) wherein a phenol is alkylated with a mixture of lower alkenes either in parallel (feed in alkene A and B at the same time) or consecutively (i.e. alkylate with alkene A and subsequently with alkene B).<br>
The invention further pertains to a stabilized thermoplastic or elastomeric resin, wherein one component comprises the liquid ayl phosphite blends and the other a polymer such as a polyolefin, polyvinyl chloride etc.<br>
The polymer stabilized by the alkylatedaryl phosphite blends of the present invention may be any thermoplastic known in the art, such as polyolefin homopolymers and copolymers, polyesters, polyurethanes, polyalkylene terephthalates, polysulfones, poiyimides, polyphenylene ethers, styrenic polymers and copolymers, polycarbonates, acrylic polymers, polyamides, polyacetals and halide-containing polymers. Mixtures of different polymers, such as polyphenylene ether/styrenic resin blends, polyvinyl chloride/ABS or other impact modified polymers, such as methacrylonitrile and alpha-methylstyrene containing ABS, and polyester/ABS or polycarbonate/ABS and polyester plus some other impact modifier may also be used. Such polymers are available commercially or may be made by means well known in the art. However, the stabilizer compositions of the invention are particularly useful in thermoplastic polymers, such as polyolefins, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyphenylene ethers and styrenic polymers, due to the extreme temperatures at which thermoplastic polymers are often processed and/or used.<br>

The additives and stabilizers described herein are preferably present in an amount effective to improve composition stability. When one of the aforementioned additives and stabilizers is utilized, the amount is generally less than about 5 weight percent based on the weight of the resin and is preferablyvat least, about, 50 ppm based on the weight of the resin. The stabilizer combinations of this invention stabilize resins especially during high temperature processing with relatively little change in melt index and/or color, even though the polymer may undergo a number of extrusions. The instant stabilizers may readily be incorporated into the resins by conventional techniques, at any convenient stage prior to the manufacture of shaped articles therefrom. For example, the stabilizer may be mixed with the<br>
resin in dry powder form, or a suspension or emulsion of the stabilizer may be mixed with a solution, suspension, or emulsion of the polymer. The stabilized compositions of the invention may optionally also contain from about 0.001 to about 5%, preferably from about 0.0025 to about 2%, and especially from about 0.005% to about 1%, by weight of various conventional additives, such as those described previously, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The stabilizers of this invention advantageously assist with the stabilization of polymer resin compositions especially in high temperature processing against changes in melt index and/or color, even though the polymer resin may undergo a number of extrusions. The stabilizers of the present invention may readily be incorporated into the resin compositions by conventional techniques, at any convenient stage prior to the manufacture of shaped articles therefrom. For example, the stabilizer may be mixed with the resin in dry powder form, or a suspension or emulsion of the stabilizer may be mixed with a solution, suspension, or emulsion of the polymer.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods, such as those involving intimate admixing of the ingredients with any additional materials desired in the formulation. Suitable procedures include solution blending and melt blending. Because of the availability of melt blending equipment in commercial polymer processing facilities, melt processing procedures are generally preferred. Examples of equipment used in such melt compounding methods include: co-rotating and counter-rotating extruders, single screw extruders, disc-pack" processors and various other types of extrusion equipment. In some instances, the compounded material exits the extruder through small exit holes in a die and the resulting strands of molten resin are cooled by passing the strands through a water bath. The cooled strands can be chopped into small pellets for packaging and further handling.<br>
All of the ingredients may be added initially to the processing system, or else certain additives may be pre-compounded with each other or with a portion of the polymeric resin to make a stabilizer concentrate. Moreover, it is also sometimes advantageous to employ at least one vent port to allow venting (either atmospheric or vacuum) of the melt. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to adjust blending times and temperatures, as well as component addition location and sequence, without undue additional experimentation.<br>
While the stabilizers of this invention may be conveniently incorporated by conventional techniques into polymeric resins before the fabrication thereof into shaped articles, it is also possible to apply the instant stabilizers by a topical application to the finished articles. Articles may comprise the instant stabilizer compounds and resins and may be made into, for example, head lamp covers, roofing sheets, telephone covers, aircraft interiors, building interiors, computer and business machine housings, automotive parts, and home appliances. The articles may be made by extrusion, injection molding, roto-molding, compaction, and other methods. This may be particularly useful with fiber applications where the instant stabilizers are applied topically to the fibers, for example, by way of a spin finish during the melt spinning process.<br>

Temperature vs. Viscosity Profile for the Phosphite Mixture Obtained as per Example 7<br>
 (Table   Removed) Example 8 Performance Evaluation by Multipass Extrusion in Poly(propylene)<br>
This example illustrates the stabilizing effectiveness of the liquid phosphite mixtures of the present invention upon multipass extrusion in poly (propylene).<br>
The base polymer was a Basell HF500N Spheripol homopolymer poly(propylene) powder with a melt-flow index (MFI) of 12 grams/10 minutes. The base formulation also contained 500 ppm of calcium stearate as an acid scavenger. All formulations were made up by adding 500 ppm each of Anox 20 (tetrakis[methylene{3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxycinnamate}]methane) and a corresponding liquid phosphite mixture of the present invention to the base polyirier.  The thus-stabilized resin formulation was extruded from a 19 mm diameter Brabender single-screw extruder at 60 rpm, with the four heating zones being set to the following temperatures: 200EC; 225EC; 250EC and 270EC under oxygen.<br>
The extrudate was cooled by passing it through an ice water bath and then pelletized. These pellets were re-extruded. After the third extrusion pass the melt flow rate (in g/10 min) was measured at 230EC/2.16 kg. A relatively small increase in melt flow index means insignificant polymer degradation, or good stabilization. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 MFI Results<br>
 <br>
Liquid Phosphite P-2: Obtained as shown in Example 3;<br>
Liquid Phosphite P-3: Phosphite mixture obtained from a butylated p-cresol alkylate,<br>
synthesized as shown under Example 2 by using a butylated p-cresol alkylate instead of<br>
butylated phenolic alkylate.<br>
Liquid Phosphite P-4: Obtained as shown in Example 7.<br>
(Table   Removed) The results from this study showed that the liquid phosphite mixtures P-2 to P-4 of the present invention gave superior melt stabilization, when compared to a control. Thus, the<br>
formulations containing a liquid phosphite mixture gave only a relatively small increase in melt flow rate compared to a control.<br>
     Example 9 Performance Evaluation in High Density Poly(ethylene)<br>
This example illustrates the stabilizing effectiveness of the liquid phosphite mixtures of the present invention upon Plasticorder testing.<br>
The base formulation comprised a Solvay HP-54-60 high density poly(ethylene) polymer flake and 300 ppm of Anox 20 (tetrakis[methylene{3,5-di-tert-buty 1-4-hydroxycinnamate}]methane). The test formulations were made up by adding a 1000 ppm of the corresponding liquid phosphite mixtures of the present invention to the base formulation.<br>
For the Plasticorder test, each formulation including the Base control was added to a Brabender Plastograph fitted with a 60 cc mixing head at 220EC/60 rpm. While kneading the test formulations in the mixing head, torque was continuously measured and recorded. After an induction period, the polymer began to cross-link, which could be seen as a significant increase in torque. Table 2 presents the time in minutes for the induction period preceding the onset of torque. A relatively long induction time is indicative of superior stabilization.<br>
Table 2 Plasticorder Test<br>
(Table   Removed) The results of this testing showed that liquid phosphite blends P-2 to P-4 afforded superior melt stabilization to an HDPE polymer, as compared to a control. Thus, the formulations containing P-2 to P-4 gave a relatively long induction time in the Plasticorder test, as compared to a control without the phosphite.<br>
