DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of highly monodispersed polymeric hydrophiUic nanoparticles having size of upto 100nm comprising in the steps of:-<br>
i) dissolving 0.01M-0.1M of a surfactant which is sodium bis ethyl hbxyl sulphosuccinate or AerosolOT in hydrocarbons which are alknes to obtain reverse micelles;<br>
ii) adding an aqueous solution of a monomer or preformed polymer as herein described to said reverse micelles followed by addition of a crosslinking agent and initator such as herein described;<br>
 iii)      subjecting the mixture to the step of polymerization;<br>
iv) drying the polymerized reaction product for removal of solvent to obtain dry nanoparticles and surfactant;<br>
v) dispersing the dry mass as obtained in step (iv) in aqueous buffer followed by treatment with calcium chloride to quantitatively remove the surfactant from the adhering nanoparticles; and<br>
vi) dialysis of the nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous buffer to remove the unreacted materials from the buffer followed by lyophilisation in a conventional manner.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the aqueous core of a reverse micellar droplet is used as a nanoreacator for the preparation of nanoparticles. The sizes of the particles which are formed primarily inside these droplet are larger than the size of the aqueous core of the droplets. Moreover, since the polymerisation take place in an aqueous medium, polymers with surface hydrophilic properties are obtained by this invention. Therefore, using reverse micellar method of the present invention, it is possible to prepare very small size nanoparticles with well as uptake by res is substantially minimized. It is possible because reverse micellar droplets<br>
i n  w h i c h  t he: po 1 y me r i c  r ea c t i o ns  are  carried   ou t a r e   h i g h 1 y m o n o dispersed.<br>
The aqueous phase is regualted in such a manner so as to keep the entire mixture in an optically transparent micro emulsion phase. The range of the aqueous phase cannot be defined as thi s won 1d de pe n d on fa c to r s su c h as the monome r, surfactant or polarity of oil, and the only factor is that the system is in an optically transparent micro e m u 1 s i o n p h a s e.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the monopar tides have a size of up to 100 nm, preferably a size of upto 10 nm to 100 nm.<br>
I n ac c o r d a n c e with t h i s i n v e n t i o n t he a qu e o u s core of a reverse mi cellar droplet is effectively used as nanoreactor to prepare ultra fine na no pa r t i c1es a n d t o e n c a psu1a t e the d rugs ( nor ma11y water soluble chemicals to maximum size upto that of 100-200 k Dal ton protein.

F" r om the va 1 ue of the t r a ns 1 a t i o na 1 diffusion coe f f i c i e nt, t he avera ge of hy d r o dy nam i c d i ame t e r D h o f the sc a 11 e r i n g par t i c1es was calculated by Strokes-Einstein relationship<br>
D         =    kT/3      T h<br>
where k is Boltzman constant, n is the viscosity of the solvent at an absolute temperature T.<br>
The size of the drug loaded nanoparticles of polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethyleneglycolfumarate and bovi ne ser urn a1 bum in were determined and representative spectra for each type are shown in<br>
the  figure  3 (a) (i to iii) shown:<br>

Figure 3 (b) shows the variation of particle size wi t h t he c ha n ge of size o f the m i c r oemu1s i on droplets. Interestingly the size of the p o1yv i ny1py r r oIidone nano pa r t i d es in c r eases exponentially with the increase of droplet size whereas the same remain more or less constant in case of bovine serum albumin-gluteraldehyde particles.<br>

A known amount of lyophilised nanoparticles encapsulating FITC-dextran was suspended in 10ml o f p h o s p h a t e b u. f f e r s a 1 i n e i n 5 0 m 1 p o 1 y p r o p y 1 e n e t u. b e s .T h e tubes were placed i n w a t e r b a t h m a i n t a :i. n e d a t 3 7 C . A t p r e d e? t e r m i n e d intervals a volume of 300ul taken from each tube and was passed through a 100KB filter (Millipore UFP2THK24) which retained the nanopart ides and the free dye came out in the filtrate. The dye concentration in the filtrate was de t e r m i ned s pe ct r o p ho t ome trieally.<br><br><br>

iv) drying the polymerized reaction product for removal of solvent to obtain dry nanoparticles and surfactant;<br>
v) dispersing the dry mass as obtained in step (iv) in aqueous buffer followed by treatment with calcium chloride to quantitatively remove the surfactant from the adhering nanoparticles; and<br>
vi) dialysis of the nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous buffer to remove the unreacted materials from the buffer followed by lyophilisation in a conventional manner.<br>
2.       A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said nanoparticles have a size of l0nm to 100 nm.<br>
3.	A   process   as   claimed   in   claim   1   wherein   said   monomers   and/or<br>
preformed   polymers   are   biocompatible   and   nonatk enic   meterials<br>

polyethyleneglycol      fumarate,       or      their      polymers       such      as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone     or     copolymer     of     polyvinylpyrrolidone     and<br>
polyethleneglycol fumarate.<br>
4.	A   process   as   claimed   in   claim    1    wherein    said   polymers   are<br>
biocompatible but antigenic which is bovine serum albumine.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said cross linking agent is N, N<br>
methylene-bis acrylamide (MBA) or glutaraldehyde.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in claim  1 wherein the said initiators are water<br>
soluble   perdisulphate   salts   selected   from   potassium   perdisulphate,<br>
potassium persulphate and ammonium perdisulphate and the activator-<br>
is tetra methyl ethylene diamine (TMED).<br>
