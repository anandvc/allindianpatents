				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel supply apparatus for a vehicle which increases a pressure of fuel within a fuel tank by an electric pump, regulates the pressure increased fuel to a predetermined pressure by a pressure control valve and supplies the fuel toward a fuel injection valve, and more particularly, to a fuel supply apparatus foravehicle in which the electric pump is arranged within the fuel tank.<br>
CONVENTIONAL ART<br>
A conventional fuel supply apparatus is shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-193552. In this fuel supply apparatus, a strainer, an electric pump and a pressure control valve are arranged in an inner side of the fuel tank. In this structure, a filter is attached to a pump suction passage of the electric pump, and foreign materials in the fuel within the fuel tank sucked toward a pump portion of the electric pump are removed by the filter.<br>
Further, clean fuel purified by the strainer is supplied within a fuel chamber of the pressure control<br>
2<br><br>
valve, and an excess fuel for regulating the pressure is discharged into the fuel tank via a return fuel hole .<br>
The fuel is supplied within the fuel tank used in such a fuel supply apparatus, for example, by an oil supply hole. Then, at a time of supplying the fuel, there is a risk that minute dusts are infiltrated within the fuel tank together with the fuel, and a lot of dusts are accumulated and stored in a bottom portion of the fuel tank in accordance with a lapse of use period the vehicle.<br>
In this case, paying attention to a time of driving the vehicle, the pressure control valve is structured such as to discharge the excess fuel within the fuel tank via the fuel hole for the purpose of regulating the fuel pressure . In the case of directly discharging the excess fuel within the fuel tank, the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion of the fuel tank are violently stirred by the fuel stream and the dusts are mixed in the fuel in a suspended state.<br>
On the other hand, at a time of driving the vehicle mentioned above, the electric pump continuously sucks the fuel within the fuel tank into the pump portion via the filter, and discharges the pressure increased fuel in the pump portion toward the external. Since the filter filtrates the fuel having a high dust concentration in which a lot of dusts are mixed, at<br>
2A<br><br>
a time when the electric pump is operated, there is a risk that a clogging of the filter is generated in a short time.<br>
Further, this clogging of the filter caused by the dusts generates problems such as a reduction in the fuel discharged from the electric pump, a deformation or a breakage in a filtration portion (for example, a net) of the fi1ter due to an internal pressure increase of the filter, and the like.<br>
In this case, it is possible to resolve the clogging of the filter by replacing or cleaning the filter in a short time, however, a frequency of maintenance is high, and executing this maintenance is not practical.<br>
Further, when the fuel is supplied within the fuel tank from the oil supply hole at a time when the vehicle stops, the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion of the fuel tank are violently stirred due to the inflow of the fuel, and the dusts are suspended in the fuel within the fuel tank. The dusts are particularly accumulated on the upper surface of the filtration portion of the filter, and generate the same problems as mentioned above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made by taking the problems mentioned above into consideration, and an<br>
3<br><br>
object of the present invention is to provide a fuel supply apparatus for a vehicle which can inhibit a clogging of a filter due to dusts accumulated on a bottom portion of a fuel tank, can prevent a pump discharging performance of an electric pump from being reduced, can prevent a filter from being deformed and broken, and can improve a maintenance property of the filter.<br>
In order to achieve the objection mentioned above, in accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fuel supply apparatus for a vehicle in which a pressure of a fuel within a fuel tank is increased by an electric pump, and said pressure increased fuel is regulated to a predetermined pressure by a pressure control valve so as to be supplied to a fuel injection valve, characterized in that an electric pump in which a filter is attached to a pump suction passage is arranged fixedly within the fuel tank, a filter cover having an opening portion which surrounds substantially all the periphery of the filter and is open to an inner side of the fuel tank is arranged in an outer periphery of said filter, and a downstream opening portion of a return fuel passage in a pressure control valve is open toward an inner side of the filter cover .<br>
Further, in accordance with 3 second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect<br>
4<br><br>
mentioned above, the filter cover is formed by a rubber material, and a wall portion directed to the filtration portion of the filter is provided on an inner wall of the filter cover so as to protrude.<br>
Further, in accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first or second aspect mentioned above, a fuel hole is pierced on an inner wall in the direction of gravity of the filter cover.<br>
Further, in accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect mentioned above, the electric pump having the filter is fixed to a support plate member firmly fixed integrally to a lid member closing the opening portion of the fuel tank, the filter cover is formed by a rubber material, an engagement protruding portion is integrally formed in a support arm portion extending upward from one side end of the inner wall, and the engagement protruding portion is engaged with an engagement groove of the support plate member so as to attach the filter cover to the support plate member.<br>
Further, in accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the third aspect mentioned above, the fuel hole pierced on the inner wall is provided in an outer side of a projection plane of a downstream opening portion in the return fuel<br>
5<br><br>
passage.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, the filter is attached to the pump suction passage of the electric pump, and the filter cover surrounding approximately, all the periphery of the filter and having the opening portion open to the inner side of the fuel tank is arranged in the outer periphery of the fi1ter.<br>
Further, the downstream opening portion of the return fuel passage in the pressure control valve is open toward the inner side of the filter cover.<br>
Accordingly, when the engine is operated, the return fuel discharged from the return fuel passage toward the fuel tank is not directly discharged into the fuel tank but is discharged to the inner side of the filter cover. In accordance with this structure, the return fuel does not stir the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion of the fuel tank, and it is possible to supply the fuel within the fuel tank having no mixed dusts to the filter via the opening portion of the filter cover.<br>
Further, when supplying the fuel into the fuel tank via the oil supply hole of the fuel tank in a state in which the engine stops, the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion of the fuel tank are stirred by the supplied fuel for a short time during the oil supply,<br>
6<br><br>
"whereby the dusts are suspended within the fuel tank. However, the dusts again drop down in accordance with their own mass, and are slightly accumulated on the upper surface of the filter cover, so that there is a little risk that the dusts are attached onto the upper surface of the filtration portion in the filter.<br>
Accordingly, since the fuel in which the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion of the fuel tank are contained in the suspended state is not supplied to<br>
the filter, it is possible to inhibit the clogging of the filter from being generated due to the dusts mentioned above, it is possible to prevent an amount of the fuel discharged from the electric pump from being reduced, and it is possible to prevent the filter from being deformed and broken.<br>
Further, in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, the filter cover is made of the rubber material, and the wall portion is provided on the inner wall of the filter cover. It is easy to manufacture the filter cover formed in a bag hole shape surrounding four surfaces of the filter by the inner wall particularly by forming the filter cover by the rubber material. Further, when the fuel within the<br>
i<br>
filter cover is sucked toward the inner side of the pump suction passage, the pressure within the filter cover is reduced, and a whole of the inner wall of the<br>
7<br><br>
filter cover is deformed so as to be brought into contact with the filtration portion of the filter, however, since only the leading end portion of the wall portion is brought into contact with the filtration portion of the filter under the condition mentioned above, a filtration area of the filter is not reduced.<br>
Further, in accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since the fuel hole is pierced on the inner wall of the filter cover in the direction of gravity, a lowest fuel use position of the fuel within the fuel tank with respect to the electric pump is determined on the basis of a position of the fuel hole.<br>
Further, in accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, the filter cover is formed by the rubber material, and the engagement protruding portion is integrally formed in the support arm portion extending upward from one side end of the inner wall. On the other hand, the support plate member for fixing the electric pump is firmly fixed to the lid member closing the opening portion of the fuel tank, the engagement groove is provided in the support plate member, and the engagement protruding portion of the filter cover is engaged with the engagement groove of the support plate member.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to extremely easily and securely mount the filter cover to the outer<br>
8<br><br>
periphery of the filter attached to the pump suction passage of the electric pump fixed to the support plate member.<br>
Further, in accordance with the fifth aspect of the present invention, since the fuel hole pierced on the inner wall of the filter cover is provided in the outer side of the projection plane of the downstream opening portion in the return fuel passage, the return fuel discharged from the return fuel passage into the filter is neither directly discharged within the fuel tank with passing through the fuel hole, nor stirs the dusts in the bottom portion of the fuel tank so as to suspend the dusts in the fuel within the fuel tank.<br>

preferably formed by a synthetic resin net, and the connection pipe 11 is also preferably formed by a synthetic resin material in this case. The support lever 11A and the filtration portion 12 are well shown in Fig. 2 .<br>
Further, an upper opening of the connection pipe 11 of the filter F is connected to the pump suction passage PA3 of the electric pump P, whereby the filter F is attached to the electric pump P. The pump discharge passage PA5 of the electric pump P is pipe connected to a first pipe 13 formed in the lid member K.<br>
Further, the pressure control valve R is screwed to the lid member K as mentioned later, and the regulator fuel inflow passage 7 of the pressure control valve R is pipe connected to a second pipe 14 formed in the lid member K.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, the connection pipe 11 of the filter F is fixedly connected to the pump section pas sage PA3 of the electric pump P, the electric pump P is mounted to the support plate member 1 firmly fixed to the lid member K, and the pump discharge passage PA5 of the electric pump P is pipe connected to the first pipe 13 of the lid member R.<br>
Further, the pressure control valve R is screwed to the lid member K, and the regulator fuel inflow<br>
13<br><br>
passage 7 is pipe connected to the second pipe 14 of the lid member K.<br>
Accordingly, when closing the opening portion TA of the fuel tank T by the lid member K, it is possible to arrange the electric pump P including the filter F and the pressure control valve R in the inner side of the fuel tank T.<br>
Further, the first pipe 13 and a fuel distribution pipe D to which a fuel injection pipe J is attached are connected by the first fuel pipe 14A, and a strainer E is arranged within the first fuel pipe 14A, whereby foreign materials in the fuel within the first fuel pipe 14A moving from the electric pump P toward the fuel distribution pipe D are removed by the strainer E .<br>

In accordance with the structure mentioned above, when the motor portion M of the electric pump P is driven and the impeller PA2 of the pump portion PA rotates<br>
14<br><br>
within the pump chamber PA1 in a state in which the vehicle is operated, the fuel within the fuel tank T purified by the filter F is sucked within the pump chamber PA1 via the pump suction passage PA3, and the fuel pressure increased by the pump chamber PA1 is supplied within the first fuel pipe 14A via the outer peripheral chamber of the motor portion M, the pump discharge passage PA5 and the first pipe 13, and the foreign materials in the fuel flowing within the first fuel pipe 14A are removed by the strainer E so as to be supplied to the first fuel pipe 14A in a downstream side .<br>

Accordingly, it is possible to supply the fuel having a predetermined fuel pressure to the fuel distribution pipe D via the first fuel pipe 14A.<br>
15<br><br>
Further, as mentioned above, in accordance with the structure in which the valve body 9 moves apart from the valve seat 8A for regulating the pressure and the valve seat 8A is relieved, the fuel existing within the fuel chamber 5 is discharged into the fuel tank T via the valve seat 8A and the return fuel passage 8 .<br>
In this case, the fuel supply apparatus for the vehicle in accordance with the present invention is particularly structured as follows.<br>
Reference numeral 20 denotes a filter cover which surrounds approximately all the periphery of the filter F and is provided with an opening portion 20A open within the fuel tank T.<br>
In more particular, the filter cover 20 is formed in a bag shape surrounding four surfaces of the filter F, that is, the bottom surface, upper surface and both side surfaces of the filtration portion 12 in the filter F, and the opening portion 20A is formed on the upper surface thereof in an open manner. (In this case, surrounding four surfaces of the filter F includes surrounding the connection pipe 11 . )<br>
Further, a support arm portion 2 0C extends from one side end 20B (the left end in the drawing) of the filter cover 2 0 upward, and an engagement protruding portion 20F constituted by a small diameter portion<br>
16<br><br>
20Danda large diameter portion 20E is integrally formed near the upper end thereof .<br>
Further, the filter cover 20 is arranged so as to face to an outer periphery of the filter F including the connection pipe 11, an opening portion 20A provided on an upper surface is arranged close to the lower end facing to the lower surface RB of the electric pump P, and the engagement protruding portion 20F provided in the support arm portion 20C is engaged with and arranged in the engagement groove 1A of the support plate member 1 in the state mentioned above, whereby the filter cover 20 is attached to the support plate member 1.<br>
In accordance with structure mentioned above, the filtration portion 12 of the filter F including the connection pipe 11 is arranged in an inner side 20G of the filter cover 20, and an inner side of the filter cover 20 and an inner side of the fuel tank T are connected via the opening portion 20A.<br>
In particular, they are connected via a gap S formed between the opening portion 2 0A in the upper side of the filter cover 20 and a lower end outer periphery of the electric pump P.<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention, a downstream opening portion 8B of the return fuel passage 8 in the pressure control valve R is connected<br>
17<br><br>
within the inner side 20G of the filter cover 20.<br>
In other words, the downstream opening portion 8B is not directly open within the fuel tank T. In the present embodiment, the downstream opening portion 8B is open to one side end 20B of the filter cover 20, however, an opening position of the filter cover 20 within the inner side 20G is not limited.<br>
Next, a description will be given of an operation thereof with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
First, in a state in which the vehicle stops, when the fuel is supplied toward the inner side of the fuel tank T from the oil supply hole (not shown) of the fuel tank T, the fuel within the fuel tank T is largely stirred, and the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion TB of the fuel tank T are mixed with the fuel and suspended within the fuel tank T.<br>
Then, the suspended dusts again drop down in accordance with their own mass according to the lapse of time, however, since approximately all the periphery of the filtration portion 12 of the filter F is arranged within the inner side 20G of the filter cover 20, the dropping dusts mentioned above are not accumulated in the filtration portion 12 (in particular, the upper surface of the filtration portion 12) of the filter F .<br>
In this case, the dusts are infiltrated to the<br>
18<br><br>
inner side 20G of the filter cover 20 via the gap S<br>
of the opening portion 20A, however, the gap Sis limited<br>
by the portion close to the lower end of the electric<br>
pump P, and a lot of dusts are not infiltrated into<br>
the filter cover 20.<br>
Next, a description will be given of an operating<br>
time of the vehicle. The return fuel discharged from the return fuel passage 8 of the pressure control valve R is discharged toward the inner side 20G of the filter cover 2 0 via the downstream opening portion 8B of the return fuel passage 8, and the fuel is again sucked to the pump portion PA of the electric pump P via the filter F.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, since the return fuel discharged from the downstream opening portion 8B of the fuel return passage 8 does not stir the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion TB of the fuel tank T, the dusts are not mixed with the fuel within the fuel tank T and are not suspended.<br>
Accordingly, since no dusts is contained in the fuel flowing into the inner side 20G of the filter cover 20 from the inner side of the fuel tank T via the gap S of the opening portion 20A of the filter cover 20, it is possible to prevent the filtration portion 12 of the filter F from being clogged by the dusts.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the<br>
19<br><br>
reduction in the discharge amount of the electric pump P which is generated by the filtration portion 12 of the filter F being clogged. Further, it is possible to prevent the deformation and the breakage of the filtration portion 12 which is generated by the increase of the inner pressure in the filtration portion 12 of the filter F. Further, it is possible to make longer the time until the dusts are attached to and accumulated in the filtration portion 12, and it is possible to lessen a maintenance frequency of the filter F. Further, since the discharge sound of the return fuel discharged from the downstream opening portion 8B of the return fuel passage 8 is shut off by the filter cover 20, no noise is leaked out to the external.<br>
Further, reference symbol 20J denotes a wall portion which is provided so as to protrude from an inner wall 20H of the filter cover 20 toward the filtration portion 12 of the filter F, and in the present embodiment, there are shown upper wall portions 20J1 which are provided so as to protrude from an upper surface of the filter cover 20 toward the upper surface of the filtration portion 12, and a lower wall portion 2 0J2 provided so as to protrude from a lower surface of the filter cover 20 toward a lower surface of the filtration portion 12.<br>
Further, the filter cover 20 is made of a rubber<br>
20<br><br>
material.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, when the fuel is sucked into the filter F from the inner side 20G of the filter cover 20, whereby the pressure within the inner side 20G of the filter cover 20 is reduced, or even when the great liquid surface fluctuation is generated within the fuel tank T, the inner wall 20H of the filter cover 20 is not brought into contact with the filtration portion 12 as a whole. That is, only leading ends 20J3 of the upper wall portions 20J1 and the lower wall portion 20J2 are brought into contact with the filtration portion 12, and the inner wall 20H of the filter cover 20 is not brought into contact therewith as a whole.<br>
Accordingly, under such a condition, it is possible to secure a sufficient filtration area of the filtration portion 12, and the discharging performance of the electric pump P is not deteriorated.<br>
Further, since the filter cover 20 is formed by the rubber material, the filtration portion 12 is not damaged even when the leading ends 20J3 are brought into contact with the filtration portion 12 . Further, even when the filter cover 20 is in contact with the bottom portion TB of the fuel tank T , no striking sound is generated.<br>
Further, since the electric pump P is fixed to<br>
21<br><br>
the support plate member 1 firmly fixed to the lid member K, the filter cover 20 is also attached to the support plate member 1, and the electric pump P and the filter cover are attached to the common support plate member 1, it is possible to accurately arrange the filter cover 20 in the outer periphery of the filter F attached to the electric pump P.<br>
Further, since the filter cover 20 is formed by the rubber material, the engagement protruding portion 20F is provided in the support arm portion 20C of the filter cover 20 , and the engagement groove 1A is provided in the support plate member 1, it is possible to arrange the filter cover 20 on an outer periphery of the filter F while elastically deforming the filter cover 20 at a time of arranging the filter cover 20 toward an outer periphery of the filter F, and it is possible to engage and arrange the engagement protruding portion 20F of the filter cover 20 in the engagement groove 1A of the supportplatemember1, whereby it is possible to improve an attaching property of the filter cover 20 to the outer periphery of the filter F and a mounting property of the filter cover 20 to the support plate member 1 of the filter cover 20, so that it is possible to largely improve an assembling property thereof. Further, while the filter cover 20 is formed in the bag hole shape so as to substantially surround the whole<br>
22<br><br>
periphery of the filter F, it is possible to easily manufacture the filter cover 20 having the bag hole shape by using the rubber material.<br>
That is , in accordance with the present embodiment, in one side end 20B and the support arm portion 20C of the filter cover, the bag hole can be manufactured by utilizing the deformation of the rubber material even when the undercut portion exists.<br>
Reference symbol 20L denotes a fuel hole which is pierced on an inner wall 20H1 in a gravitational direction of the filter cover 20.<br>
In this case, the inner wall 20H1 in the gravitational direction means an inner wall of the side surfaces except the upper surface and the lower surface of the filter cover 2 0,. and means an inner wall substantially orthogonal to the fuel liquid surface X-X formed within the fuel tank T.<br>
Since the fuel hole 20L is pierced on the inner wall 20H1 in the gravitational direction, the fuel stored within the fuel tank T is flowed within the inner side 20G of the filter cover 20 until the opening of the fuel hole 20L is positioned on the fuel liquid surface X-X within the fuel tank T, and this fuel is sucked out by the electric pump P.<br>
Since the fuel hole 20L is provided, it is possible to regulate a dead remaining amount of the fuel within<br>
23<br><br>
the fuel tank T (the fuel which the electric pump P can not suck out) .<br>
That is, if the fuel hole 20L is arranged at a too high position, the dead remaining amount of the fuel is too much and is not preferable. Further, if the fuel hole 20L is arranged at a too low position, there is a risk that the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion TB of the fuel tank T inflow, and this is not preferable. Accordingly, the height position of the fuel hole 20L is properly selected taking the above matter into consideration.<br>
Further, when the fuel hole 20L is provided, it is preferable that the fuel hole is provided in an outer side of a projection surface of the downstream opening portion 8B in the return fuel passage 8. Providing in the outer side of the projection surface means not to position the fuel hole 20L on the extension line of the downstream opening 8B.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, it is possible to prevent the return fuel energetically discharged to the inner side of the filter cover 20 from the downstream opening 8B of the return fuel passage 8 from being energetically flowed out into the fuel tank T from the fuel hole 20L, whereby the fuel within the fuel tank T is not stirred and the dusts are not mixed into the fuel.<br>
24<br><br>
Further, when using a regeneration pump portion formed in a closed vane shape and having a plurality of vane grooves on the front and back of the impeller PA2 for the pump portion PA, like as the present embodiment, vapors generated within the pump chamber PA1 are discharged from trie lower surface PB of the electric pump P toward the inner side of the filter cover 20 via a vapor bleeding passage PA6 together with a part of the pressure increased fuel within the pump chamber PA1.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion TB of the fuel tank T is not stirred by the fuel containing the vapor discharged from the vapor bleeding passage PA6 , and it is possible to solve the problem caused by the dusts in the same manner.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of a fuel supply apparatus for a vehicle in accordance with the present invent ion.<br>
In the present embodiment, an arrangement of the strainer is different from the first embodiment, and a description will be given only of a different portion. (A description of the same structure portions will be omitted by using the same reference numerals.) The strainer E is arranged in a fuel pipe connecting the pump discharge passage PA5 of the electric pump P to<br>
25<br><br>
the first pipe 13, and is arranged in the inner side of the fuel tank T together with the electric pump P and the pressure control valve R.<br>
Further, an inflow side passage EA of the strainer E is connected to the pump discharge passage PA5 of the electric pump P , and a discharge side passage EB of the strainer E is connected to a fuel distribution pipe D via the first pipe 13 and the first fuel pipe 14A .<br>
Further, the second fuel pipe 15 is branched from<br>
the first pipe 13, and this second fuel pipe 15 is<br>
connected to the regulator fuel inflow passage 7 of<br>
the pressure control valve R via the second pipe 14.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment mentioned above,<br>
since the strainer E can be arranged within the fuel<br>
tank T in addition that the same operations and effects<br>
as those of the embodiment mentioned above are achieved,<br>
it is possible to secure a great space outside the fuel<br>
tank T, it is possible to increase a freedom of arranging<br>
with respect to the other constituting parts of the<br>
vehicle, and it is possible to make the piping operation<br>
easy .<br>
As described above, in accordance with the invention described in the first aspect of the present invention, since the electric pump in which the filter is attached to the pump suction passage is received<br>
26<br><br>
and arranged within the fuel tank fixedly, the filter cover having the opening portion which surrounds approximately all the periphery of the filter and is open to the inner side of the fuel tank is arranged in the outer periphery of the filter, and the downstream opening portion of the return fuel passage in the pressure control valve is open toward the inner side of the filter cover, the dusts accumulated in the bottom portion of the fuel tank are not stirred by the fuel at a time when the fuel is supplied into the fuel tank and the return fuel is discharged from the return fuel passage, it is possible to inhibit the filter from being clogged by the dusts, whereby it is possible to prevent the pump discharge amount of the electric pump from being reduced, it is possible to prevent the filter from being deformed and broken, and it is possible to improve a maintenance property of the filter.<br>
Further, in accordance with the invention described in the second aspect of the present invent ion, since the filter cover is made of the rubber material, and the wall portion toward the filtration portion of the filter is provided on the inner wall of the filter cover so as to protrude, the inner wall of the filter cover is not brought into contact with a whole of the filtration portion of the filter even in the case that the filter cover is deformed toward the inner side,<br>
2 7<br><br>
and the filtration area of the filter is not reduced.<br>
Further, since the filter cover is formed by the rubber material, the leading end of the wall portion does not damage the filtration portion at a time of being brought into contact with the filtration portion of the filter, and the striking sound and the sliding sound are not generated even when the filter cover is brought into contact with the fuel tank.<br>
Further, in accordance with the invention described in the third aspect of the present invention, since the fuel hole is pierced on the inner wall in the direction of gravity of the filter cover, the dead remaining amount of the fuel within the fuel tank can be property selected by selecting the opening position of the fuel hole independent from the opening portion of the filter cover.<br>
Further, in accordance with the invention described in the fourth aspect of the present invention, since the electric pump having the filter is fixed to the support plate member firmly fixed integrally to the lid member closing the opening portion of the fuel tank, the filter cover is formed by the rubber material, the engagement protruding portion is integrally formed in the support arm portion extending upward from one side end of the inner wall, and the engagement protruding portion is engaged with the engagement groove of the<br>
28<br><br>
support plate member so as to attach the filter cover to the support plate member, the electric pump provided with the filter and the filter cover are mounted to the common support plate member, so that it is possible to accurately arrange the filter cover toward the outer periphery of the filtration portion of the filter.<br>
Further, since the filter cover can be arranged on the outer periphery of the filtration portion of the filter by engaging the engagement protruding portion provided in the support arm portion of the filter cover made of the rubber material with the engagement groove of the support plate member, and it is possible to elastically deform the filter cover at this time, it is possible to improve an attaching property of the filter cover.<br>
Further, forming the filter cover by the rubber material is advantageous because an undercut portion can be included at a time of manufacturing the filter cover as the bag shape for the purpose of particularly surrounding the filtration portion of the filter.<br>
Further, in accordance with the invention described in the fifth aspect of the present invention, since the fuel hole provided on the inner wall is provided in the outer side of the projection plane of the downstream opening portion in the return fuel passage, the fuel discharged from the return fuel<br>
29<br><br>
passage into the filter cover is not discharged to the outer side of the filter cover via the fuel hole, to stir the dusts in the fuel tank.<br>
30<br><br>
