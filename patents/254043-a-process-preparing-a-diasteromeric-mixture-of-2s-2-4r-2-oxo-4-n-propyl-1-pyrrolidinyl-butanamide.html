The mixture is stirred for an additional 3 hours and then<br>
the reaction is allowed to complete at 18°C for 1 hour. The ammonium tartrate is filtered. Yield : 86%.1.2 Synthesis of 5-hydroxy-4-n-propyl-furan-2-one<br>
(Figure Removed) heptane (394 ml) and morpholine (127.5 ml) are introduced in a reactor. The mixture is cooled to 0°C and glyoxylic acid (195 g, 150 ml, 5Ow% in water) is added. The mixture is heated at 20°C during 1 hour, and then valeraldehyde (148.8 ml) is added . The reaction mixture is heated at 43°C during 20 hours. After cooling down to 20°C, a 37 % aqueous solution of HCl (196.9 ml) is slowly added to the mixture, which is then stirred during 2 hours.<br>
After removal of the heptane phase, the aqueous phase is washed three times with heptane. Diisopropyl ether is added to the aqueous phase. The organic phase is removed, and the aqueous phase further extracted with diisopropyl ether (2x). The diisopropyl ether phases are combined, washed with brine and then dried by azeotropic distillation. After filtration and evaporation of the solvent, 170g of 5-hydroxy-4-n-propyl-furan-2-one are obtained as a brown oil. Yield: 90.8 %<br>
1.3 Synthesis of (2S)-2-((4R)-2-oxo-4-n-propyl-l-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide and (2S)-2-((4S)-2-oxo-4-n-propyl-l-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide(Figure Removed) The (2S)-2-aminobutyramide solution in isopropanol containing 250 g obtained as described here above is dried by azeotropic distillation under vacuum. To the dried {2S)-2-amtnobutyramide solution is added 5-hydroxy-4-n-propyl-furan-2-one (290 g) between 15°G and 25 °C; the mixture is heated to 30 °C and kept for at least 2 hours atthat temperature. Acetic acid (1,18 eq.), Pd/C catalyst (5 w/w%; Johnson Matthey 5% Pd on carbon - type 87L) are then added and hydrogen introduced into the system under pressure. The temperature is kept at 40 °C maximum and the Ha pressure maintained between 0,2 bar and 0,5 bar followed by stirring for at least 20 hours following the initial reaction. The solution is then cooled to between 15 °C and 25 °C and filtered to remove the catalyst. The solution of product in isopropanol is solvent switched to a solution of product in isopropyl acetate by azeotropic distillation with isopropyl acetate. The organic solution is washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate followed by a brine wash and then filtered.

The resulting ammonium chloride is removed from this solution by filtration and the solution is directly used for reaction with 5-hydroxy-4-n-propyl-furan-2-one (23,62 g, 1.0 equivalent) without<br>
ntermediate drying of the (2S)-2-aminobutyramide solution. Yield after separation of the two diastereoisomers and recristallisation: approximately 84%.<br>

The solution is cooled between 15 °C and 25 °C and filtered to remove the catalyst.<br>
Ethanol is removed under vacuum and the desired compound extracted with ethyl acetate; the organic solution is then washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give (S)-(-)-a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide (Yield: 13%).<br>

Then Pd/C catalyst (10 w/w%; Johnson Matthey 5% Pd on carbon - type 87L) is added and hydrogen introduced into the system under pressure. The temperature is kept at 40°C maximum and the hydrogen pressure between 4 bar and 5 bar, followed by stirring for at least 20 hours following the initial reaction. The<br><br>
solution is then cooled between 15°C and 25°C and filtered to remove the catalyst. The solvent is evaporated tinder vacuum and the resulting yellow product is purified by preparative liquid chromatography (eluent: dichloromethane /methanol (95:5)) (Yield 43%).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
