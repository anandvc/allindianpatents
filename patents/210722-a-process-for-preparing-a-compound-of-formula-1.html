DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the recitations herein, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl,<br>
10 	ethyl, /7-propyl, /-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl<br>
15 	isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl. "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkylamino", "alkenylthio", "alkenylsulfinyl", "alkenylsulfonyl", "alkynylthio", "alkynylsulfinyl", "alkynylsulfonyl",   and  the  like,   are  defined  analogously  to  the   above   examples.<br>
20 	"Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. The term "cycloalkoxy" includes the same groups linked through an oxygen atom such as cyclopentyloxy and cyclohexylox)'. "Cycloalkenyl" includes groups such as cyclopentenyl and cyclohexenyl as well as groups with more than one double bond such as 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexadienyl.   Examples of "alkylcarbonyl" include C(0)CH3, C(0)CH2CH2CH3<br>
25     and    C(0)CH(CH3)2.	Examples    of    "alkoxycarbonyl"    include    CH30C(=O),<br>
CH3CH2OC(=0), CH3CH2CH2OC(=0), (CH3)2CHOC(=0) and the different butoxy- or pentoxycarbonyl isomers. Other groups are defined analogously.<br>
The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.   Further, when used in compound words such as<br>
30 	"haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, C1CH2, CF3CH2 and CF3CC12.   The terms "haloalkenyl", "haloalkoxy" and the like, are defined analogously to<br>
4<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
the term "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include (C1)2C=CHCH2 and CF3CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF30, CC13CH20, HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group can be indicated by the<br>
5        "Cj-Cj" prefix where, for example, i and j are numbers from 1 to 8. For example, C2-C3<br><br>
	alkyl designates methyl through propyl. When a compound is substituted with a substituent<br>
bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said<br>
substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined<br>
substituents.<br>
10	The term "member" in the description of a chain or ring refers to an atom forming part<br>
	of the backbone structure of said chain or ring. If said chain or ring is said to be optionally<br>
substituted, the atom members are optionally substituted with one or more substituent<br>
groups, consistent with the atom members' free valency  remaining after bonding of the atom<br>
members to form the chain or ring.<br>
15	The term "optionally substituted" refers to a chain, ring or other group that is<br>
unsubstituted or substituted with at least one moiety other than hydrogen by replacement of said hydrogen.<br>
The term "carbocyclic ring" denotes a ring wherein the atoms forming the ring<br>
backbone are selected only from carbon.    The term "heterocyclic ring" denotes a ring<br>
20     wherein at least one atom forming the ring backbone is carbon and at least one other atom<br>
forming the ring backbone is other than carbon.   The term "aryl" refers to an aromatic<br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring to which is optionally fused one or more aromatic or<br>
nonaromatic rings.  Aromatic indicates that each of ring atoms is essentially in the same<br>
plane and has a j&gt;-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4n + 2) n electrons,<br>
25     when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Hiickel's rule.<br>
A "ring system" refers to two or more fused rings.  Examples of aromatic carbocyclic ring<br>
and ring systems include benzene, naphthalene,  anthracene and the like.     The term<br>
"heteroaromatic ring" means an aromatic heterocyclic ring.     Examples  of aromatic<br>
heterocyclic rings include thiophene, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, pyrrole,<br>
30       triazine, triazole and furan. A "nonaromatic heterocyclic ring" generally is a single ring with<br>
a backbone containing at least one carbon atom and one to four heteroatoms independently<br>
selected from the group nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each ring contains no<br>
more than four nitrogens, no more than two oxygens and no more than two sulfurs.   Said<br>
rings can be fully saturated heterocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles<br>
35     in which the Hiickel rule for aromaticity is not satisfied by the ring.    Examples of<br>
nonaromatic heterocyclic rings include tetrahydrofuran. thiolane, pyrrolidine, 1,3-dioxolane,<br>
1.3-dithiolane, 1,3- and 1,4-dioxane, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-l,3-dioxepin and the like.   Hetero-<br>
3<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
cyclic ring systems can be attached to other groups through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen oh said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen-containing heterocycles can form TV-oxides, because the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the <br>
5        oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can <br>
form TV-oxides.   One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form TV-oxides.   Synthetic methods for the preparation of TV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and m-chloroperbenzoic acid <br>
10     	(MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium <br>
perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane.  These methods for the preparation of TV-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol.<br>

Molecular depictions  drawn herein follow  standard  conventions  for depicting<br>
(Stereochemistry. To indicate stereoconfiguration, bonds rising from the plane of the drawing<br>
and towards the viewer are denoted by solid wedges wherein the broad end of the wedge is<br>
attached to the atom rising from the plane of the drawing towards the viewer. Bonds going<br>
25     below the plane of the drawing and away from the viewer are denoted by dashed wedges<br>
wherein the narrow end of the wedge is attached to the atom further away from the viewer.<br>
Constant width lines indicate bonds with a direction opposite or neutral relative to bonds<br>
shown with solid or dashed wedges; constant width lines also depict bonds in molecules or<br>
parts of molecules in which no particular stereoconfiguration is intended to be specified.<br>
30	An asterisk (*) is used to indicate the Formula I hydroxylation center comprising the<br>
hydroxy group introduced by a process of this invention. When two of the groups attached<br>
to the hydroxylation center are identical a mirror plane of symmetry exists through the<br>
hydroxylation center. In this situation the hydroxylation center is achiral. If no mirror plane<br>
of symmetry exists through the hydroxylation center, then the hydroxylation center is a<br>
35      chiral center, resulting in. two possible enantiomers corresponding to the two possible<br>
configurations at the chiral center.  When the enantiomers are present in equal amounts the<br>
Formula I compound is racemic at the hydroxylation center; otherwise one enantiomer is<br>
6<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
present in excess and the Formula I compound is described as enantiomerically enriched at the hydroxylation center.<br>
Furthermore, R1, R2 and R3 of Formulae I and II can optionally comprise one or more additional chiral centers. R6 of Formulae IE and IV can also optionally comprise one or <br>
5	.more chiral centers. A statement that Formula I is achiral, racemic or enantiomerically enriched at the hydroxylation center indicated by * refers only to that center. For example, a compound of Formula I that is racemic at the chiral center indicated by * can at the same time be enantiomerically enriched at other chiral centers.<br>
For a general reference regarding enantiomers and enantioselective processes, see <br>

This invention pertains to a process for preparing compounds of Formula I by contacting a compound of Formula II with an oxidant and a zirconium complex, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein * indicates the hydroxylation center, and R1, R2 and R3 are as defined in the Summary of the Invention.<br>
More specifically in this process, the compound of Formula I is prepared by contacting a compound of Formula II with generally about 0.9 to 10.0 equivalents or more of an <br>
20.	oxidant in the presence of about 0.001 to 1.5 equivalents of a zirconium complex, and optionally an inert solvent. Typical reaction conditions include reaction temperatures in the range of about -5 to 100 °C and reaction times of about 2 hours to 8 days. Suitable oxidants include oxygen (e.g., air), hydrogen peroxide, monoethers of hydrogen peroxide including tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide and combinations thereof, peracids such as<br>
25. 	peracetic acid or m-chloroperbenzoic acid, hypochlorites such as sodium hypochlorite, <br>
monopersulfates such as potassium monopersulfate (e.g., Qxone®), and dioxiranes such as dimethyldioxirane. A particularly useful oxidant for this process is hydrogen peroxide or a mono ether of hydrogen peroxide. A preferred oxidant is tert-t-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, mesitylene and cumene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane and ortho-dichlorobenzene, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and methyl isopropyl ketone, esters such as methyl acetate,<br>

WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, alcohols such as methanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol, or ethers such as -diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Aromatic hydrocarbon solvents are preferred.<br>
In one embodiment of this process, an achiral or racemic zirconium catalyst is used to <br>
5 		prepare a compound of Formula I in racemic form. Suitable achiral or racemic zirconium  complexes include zirconium alkoxide complexes such as zirconium(rV) isopropoxide, zirconium(IV) butoxide, zhconium(IV) fe/t-butoxide, and zhconium(IV) propoxidea, zirconium(IV) (3-dicarbonyl complexes such as zirconium(IV) acet}dacetonate, zirconium(IV) aryloxide complexes, zirconium(IV) amine complexes, or zkcorrium(rV)<br>
10 	amido complexes. Zirconium(rV) (1^-04 alkoxide and zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate are preferred, and zirconium(IV) isopropoxide and zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate are particularly useful. Zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate is most preferred because it is less hygroscopic than zirconium(IV) alkoxide complexes. For this racemic embodiment, hydrogen peroxide or a monoether of hydrogen peroxide is preferred as oxidant, and<br>
15     tert-butyl hydroxide is especially preferred as oxidant.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an enantiomerically enriched compound of Formula I is prepared by an enantioselective procedure. By "enantiomerically enriched" it is meant that a bulk sample of the compound contains an excess of either the (+) or (-) enantiomer and includes anything greater than a 1-to-l  (racemic) mixture of<br>
20 	enantiomers up to and including 100% of the pure enantiomer. By definition, the enantiomeric excess (ee) of a sample is expressed as a percentage and is given by the equation<br>
Enantiomeric Excess = [(Enl - En2) • 100%] / (Enl + En2)<br>
where Enl and En2 are the amounts of the two enantiomers. Thus, for example, an enriched<br>
25     compound having 25% (-) enantiomer and 75% (+) enantiomer is referred to as having a<br>
50% enantiomeric excess of the (+) enantiomer.  Enantiomerically enriched compounds of<br>
Formula I, can be produced, for example, by physically separating the enantiomers of a<br>
racemic mixture according to standard methods.   However, such methods are difficult to<br>
operate on a large scale and are often wasteful, because the undesired enantiomer must be<br>
30     discarded if it cannot be racemized.   By "enantioselective" it is meant that the desired<br>
enantiomer of the  chiral product is formed preferentially,  although not necessarily<br>
exclusively.   "Enantiomeric purity" is calculated the same way as enantiomeric excess; a<br>
product of 100% enantiomeric purity has one enantiomer in 100% excess and none of the<br>
other enantiomer; a product of 0% enantiomeric purity has equal amounts of enantiomers<br>
35     such that neither is in excess, and therefore the product is racemic.<br>

For the embodiment of the present invention pertaining to a process for preparing enantiomerically enriched compounds of Formula I by contacting a compound of Formula II with an oxidant and a chiral zirconium complex, a reaction temperature of about 20 to 75 °C and tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant are preferred. Chiral zirconium complexes suitable for this process including preferred chiral complexes comprising zirconium and ligands of Formula III or its enantiomer (ent-III) are described in further detail below.<br><br>

wherein J, R6 and n are as defined in the Summary of the Invention.<br>
R1, R2 and R3 in Formulae I and II are appendages not directly involved in the hydroxylation reaction center. Because the reaction conditions of the hydroxylation process of the invention are so mild, a wide range of molecular structural features are possible for R1, R2 and R3, and only functionalities most reactive to oxidative conditions are susceptible to being affected. Therefore the substituent radicals listed for R1, R2 and R3 in the Summary of the Invention should be regarded as just describing a subgenus illustrative of the wide range of applicability of the process of this invention. Many of the radicals specified in the Summary of the Invention for R1, R2 and R3 in Formulae I and II are optionally substituted. A wide range of optional substituents are possible; illustrative optional substituents include alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl,. hydroxycafbonyl, formyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, alkynylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyl-oxy, cycloalkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, alkenylthio, alkynylthio, cycloalkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfinyl, alkenylsulfinyl, alkynylsulfmyl, cycloalkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkenylsulfonyl, alkynylsulfonyl, cycloalkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, amino, alkylamino, alkenylamino, alkynylamino, arylamino, aminocarbonyl, alkylarninocarbonyl, alkenyl-aminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyl, alkylarninocarbonyl, alkenyl-aminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkenyloxycarbonylamino, alk)Tiyloxycarbonylamino and aryloxycarboylamino, each further optionally substituted, and halogen, cyano and nitro. The optional further substituents are independently selected from groups like those illustrated above to give groups such as haloalkyl, haloalkenyl and haloalkoxy. As a further example, alkylarnino can be further substituted with alkyl, giving dialkylamino.   The substituents can also be tied<br>
9<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
together by figuratively removing one or two hydrogen atoms from each of two substituents<br>
or a substituent and the supporting molecular structure and joining the radicals to produce<br>
cyclic and polycyclic structures fused or appended to the molecular structure supporting the<br>
substituents. For example, tying together adjacent hydroxy and methoxy groups attached to,<br>
5     for example, a phenyl ring gives a fused dioxolane structure containing the linking group<br>
-O-CH2-O-.   Tying together a hydroxy group and the molecular structure to which it is<br>
attached can give cyclic ethers, including epoxides.   Illustrative substituents also include<br>
oxygen, which when attached to carbon forms a carbonyl function. Preferred processes of<br>
the invention are those wherein in Formulae I and II, the carbon atom of R2 connected to the<br>
10     center indicated by * is in the form of a methyl, methylene or carbonyl unit.   When the<br>
connecting carbon of R2 is in the form of a carbonyl unit, it forms a tricarbonyl system with<br>
the other two carbonyls of Formula II. The enhanced acidity of the tricarbonyl system can<br>
facilitate the hydroxylation of Formula II to give Formula I.<br>
Although there is no definite limit to the sizes of Formulae I and II suitable for the<br>
15     processes of the invention, typically Formula II comprises 5-100, more commonly 5-50,<br>
and most commonly 5-25 carbon atoms, and 2-25, more commonly 2-15, and most<br>
commonly 2—10 heteroatoms.    The heteroatoms are commonly selected from halogen,<br>
oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus, and more commonly, halogen, oxygen and<br>
nitrogen. Two heteroatoms in Formula II are the p-dicarbonyl oxygen atoms. The numbers<br>
20     of atoms commonly in Formula I are similar to those described by Formula II, except that as<br>
result of rrydroxylation, Formula I has one more heteroatom. Also, there is no definite limit<br>
to the size of the illustrative groups listed for R1, R2 and R3, but alkyl, including derivatives<br>
such as alkoxy, is commonly C1-C8, alkenyl and alkynyl are commonly C2-C8 and more<br>
commonly C2-C8, and cycloalkyl is commonly C3-C8.<br>
25	One skilled in the art recognizes that sulfinyl and particularly thio moieties (in, for<br>
example,   alkylthio,   alkenylthio,   alkynylthio,   cycloalkylthio,   arylthio,   alkylsuliinyl,<br>
alkenylsulfinyl,   alkynylsulfinyl,   cycloalkylsulfinyl   and   arylsulfinyl   substituents)   are<br>
susceptible to oxidation.   Thio- and sulfmyl-containing substituents in Formula II do not<br>
prevent the hydroxylation reaction of this invention, but thio can be converted to sulfinyl and<br>
30     sulfonyl, and sulfinyl converted to sulfonyl in the product of Formula I.<br>
Of note are processes of this invention wherein, in Formulae I and II, R2 is H, alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, a phenyl ring, or a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, each ring optionally<br>
substituted; and R1 and R3 are not taken together.    Of note also are processes of the<br>
invention wherein, in Formulae I and II, R1 is H; or alkoxy, alkyl, cycloalkyl, a phenyl ring,<br>
35     a phenoxy ring or a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, each optionally substituted; and<br>
R3 is alkoxy, alkyl, cycloalkyl, a phenyl ring, or a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring,<br>
each optionally substituted.<br><br><br>

wherein * indicates the hydroxylation center, which is a chiral center, and Formula la is racemic or enantiomerically enriched.<br>
20 	Formulae la and Ila are subsets of Formula I and II, respectively, in which R2 and R3 are taken together to form a linking chain of 3 carbon members fused to a phenyl ring substituted with R4.

R2 and R3 can be taken together to form an optionally substituted linking chain of 3 to 4 carbon members optionally fused to an optionally substituted phenyl ring. Note that this preferred embodiment provides for the hydroxylation of P-keto esters.<br>
A more preferred process of this invention is one wherein a compound of Formula Ha 5     wherein R1 is Gi~C3 alkoxy and R4 is F, CI, or Cj-C3 fluoroalkoxy is contacted with an oxidant and a zirconium complex to prepare a compound of Formula la that is racemic or enantiomerically enriched at the chiral center indicated by *.<br>
Most preferred is a process in which a compound of Formula Ila is contacted with an oxidant and a chiral zirconium complex comprising zirconium and a ligand of Formula HI or 10 its enantiomer. Preparation of compounds of Formula la from compounds of Formula Ha has been previously reported in WO 95/29171 using a different process. The process of the instant invention provides higher yields of Formula la and is more convenient to run compared to the previously reported process. The process of the instant invention also affords improved enantioselectivity over the enantioselective process reported in WO 15     95/29171.<br>
As already described, the hydroxylation process of this invention is generally applicable to a wide range of starting compounds of Formula II, which are obtainable through the methodologies known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. For example, compounds of Formula Ila can be prepared by the methods described by R. Shapiro et al. 20 "Toward the Manufacture of Indoxacarb" Chapter 17 (pp. 178-185 in Synthesis and Ckemistry ofAgro chemicals VI (ACS Symposium Series 800), American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, 2002 and particularly PCT Publication WO 96/20151.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention pertains to  chiral zirconium  complexes<br>
comprising zirconium and a chiral ligand of Formula HI or its enantiomer (ent-III).   The<br>
25     chiral centers of the chiral ligands of Formula in must provide overall chirality with the<br>
configurations of the NH linking groups as depicted, thereby excluding meso stereoisomers,<br>
which do not form enantiomers. The chiral zirconium complexes are suitable for the process<br>
for preparing enantiomerically enriched compounds of Formula I from Formula II.   In the<br>
Summary of the Invention, rings (e.g., phenyl) and ring systems are described for J and R6 in<br>
30     Formulae III and ent-III as being optionally substituted. As these optional substituents are<br>
spatially separate from the region of Formulae HI and ent-III complexing to zirconium(IV),<br>
a wide range of substituents are possible, but at the same time, generally do not increase the<br>
usefulness of the zirconium complexes for the hydroxylation process of the invention.<br>
Optional substituents most easily included in Formulae III and ent-UI are alkyl, haloalkyl,<br>
35     alkoxy, haloalkoxy, halogen and nitro; more particularly, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 haloalkyl,<br>
C1-C4 alkoxy, Cy-C^ haloalkoxy. halogen and nitro, and more preferably C1-C4 alkyl,<br>
C1-C4 alkoxy, halogen and nitro. Preferably, the optional substituents for the rings and ring<br>

systems described for J and R6 are selected and positioned so that Formulae III and ent-III has a C2 axis ;of symmetry. More preferably, the rings and ring systems in J and R6 do not have optional substituents. Of note are compounds of Formulae III and ent-III wherein R6 is other than the following: adamantyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl optionally substituted with Cj-C2 alkyl, C2-C5 alkylcarbonyloxy, C2-C5 alkoxycarbonyloxy, and optionally substituted phenylcarbonyloxy.<br>
If the linking chain of J is fused to form a C3-Cg nonaromatic heterocyclic ring, preferably said nonaromatic heterocyclic ring is fully saturated; also preferably said ring is connected through carbon atoms of said ring to the aminomethyl moieties connecting to the remainder of Formulae III and ent-III.

Accordingly, for this embodiment of the invention, the chiral zirconium complex comprises a complex prepared from a chiral ligand of Formula III or its enantiomer and a zirconium complex. One skilled in the art will realize that the enantioselectivity of the hydroxylation reaction will generally decrease as the enantiomeric purity of the chiral ligand decreases. By the same reasoning, one skilled in the art will also realize that using a chiral ligand with greater than 0% enantiomeric purity (i.e. a chiral ligand that is enantiornerically enriched) may produce an enantiornerically enriched hydroxylation product. Preferably the enantiomeric purity of the chiral ligand is at least about 50%, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 98%, and most preferably at least 99%.<br>
The chiral zirconium complex can be prepared by contacting the zirconium complex with 0.1 to 5 equivalents of a compound of Formula III or ent-III, optionally in the presence of a solvent. Typical reaction conditions include reaction temperatures in the range of about -5 to 100 °C and reaction times of about 30 minutes to 3 days. Preferred chiral zirconium complexes comprise chiral ligands that have a C2 axis of symmetry. As a substituent adjacent to the -OH function on each phenyl ring of Formula .JH (and ent-III) can promote stereoselectivity of the process, preferred are chiral zirconium complexes comprising ligands of Formula III or ent-III wherein each phenyl ring has an R6 substituent ortho to the -OH function. More preferred are chiral zirconium complexes comprising ligands of Formula HI or ent-III wherein each R6 substituent ortho to the -OH function is tart-butyl. Particularly suitable ligands of Formula III or ent-III include structures where the HN-J-NH group is the diradical of (15,25)- or (lR,2R)-l,2-cyclohexanediamine, (15,25)- or (lR,2R)-l,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediamine (also known as (5,5)- or (j^)-l,2-diphenylemylenediarnine), (15)- or (lR)-[l,l'-binaphthalene]-2,2'-diamine (also known as (5)- or (i?)-l,r-binaphthyl-2,2'-diarnine), and (25,35)- or (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanediamide (also known as (S,S)- or (R,R)-tartaric acid diamide).

Another embodiment of this invention pertains to the ligand of Formula III or its enantiomer ent-O. Preferred ligands of Formulae III or ent-III are those of the preferred chiral zirconium complexes. Particularly preferred are ligands of Formulae Ilia, ent-IIIa, Illb and ent-IIIb. Most preferred are ligands of Formulae Ilia and Illb, as the hydroxylation reaction of the invention involving a zirconium complex comprising a ligand selected from Formulae IIIa and IIIb is particularly useful for enantioselectively preparing the more efficacious S configuration of arthropodicidal oxadiazines of Formula V (depicted below).<br>
Ligands of Formula III or ent-III can be prepared by general methods known in the art, such as those depicted in Scheme 1. Note that Formula III is illustrated in Scheme 1; preparation of ent-III can be accomplished by using the enantiomer of compounds of Formula 1 in the syntheses illustrated.<br><br>

The first method involves the condensation of a chiral diamine of Formula 1, wherein J is defined as above for Formula EI, with two equivalents of an appropriately substituted salicylaldehyde derivative of Formula 2 to form the Schiff base (imine) adduct of Formula 3 shown in Scheme 1. Excess amounts of compounds of Formula 2 may be used to facilitate this condensation. Subsequent reduction of the Schiff base with reagents such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride or by catalytic hydrogenation affords the desired ligands of Formula in. The reduction using sodium cyanoborohydride is conducted in the presence of acid, such as hydrochloric acid, in a suitable solvent, such as a mixture of ethanol and toluene.<br>
Catalytic hydrogenation of compounds of Formula 3 to give the corresponding ligands of Formula IH can be carried out using supported precious metal catalysts. Palladium- and platinum-based catalysts are preferred, with platinum being most preferred. Typical catalyst supports include carbon, alumina and calcium carbonate. Amorphous carbon supports, such as charcoal, are preferred. Any solvent compatible with the reaction conditions can be used, and preferably the solvent is aprotic. Particularly suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene.   The reaction can be promoted by the addition of a<br>

WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
carboxylic acid (e.g., acetic acid) or mineral acid (e.g., sulfuric acid). Acetic acid is particularly useful because of its low corrosivity and ease of removal from the product solution. Best results are obtained when the reaction mixture is essentially free from water, which could otherwise cause hydrolysis of the Schiff base starting material. Therefore both <br>
5     	the solvent and catalyst should be anhydrous.<br>
Salicylaldehyde derivatives of Formula 2 are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods well known in the art. Another method for the preparation of a ligand of Formula III involves the reaction of a chiral diamine of Formula 1 with two equivalents of a benzyl halide or benzyl sulfonate of Formula 4. Optionally an additional base, such as<br>
10 	organic bases such as triethylamine or inorganic bases such as sodium or potassium carbonate or sodium or potassium hydroxide may be used to facilitate this reaction. Excess amounts of compounds of Formula 4 may also be used to facilitate this reaction.<br>
Ligands of Formula III can also be prepared from compounds of Formula IV by reduction of the C(=0)NH moiety using reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride<br>
15     (Scheme 2).  Enantiomers of Formula III may be prepared by reduction of the enantiomers of Formula IV. Reductions of amides to amines are well known in the art; see, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistiy:   Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, 3rd ed., 1985, Wiley, New York, p. 1099; and R. C.

The  hydroxylation method   of the  invention  is  useful   for  preparation  of an arthropodicidal oxadiazine of Formula V, involving as process intermediate the compound of<br>
25     Formula la prepared by said hydroxylation method<br><br>

wherein Formulae V and la are racemic or enantiomerically enriched at the chiral center indicated by *, R1 is C1-C3 alkoxy, and R4 is F, CI or C1-C3 fluoroalkoxy. Preferred because of excellent arthropodicidal efficacy of the oxadiazine product of Formula V is the <br>
30 	aforementioned preparation wherein R1 is OCH3 and R4 is CI. As the enantiomer of Formula V having the S configuration has much greater arthropodicidal efficacy than does<br>

PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
its antipode having the R configuration, preferred is the preparation wherein Formulae V and la are enantiomerically enriched with the S isomer obtained by hydroxylation using a chiral zirconium catalyst.<br>
As already discussed, the compound of Formula la can be prepared from the corresponding compound of Formula Ila using the hydroxylation method of the invention. The further steps leading to the preparation of the compound of Formula V from Formula la are disclosed by R. Shapiro et al. "Toward the Manufacture of Indoxacarb" Chapter 17 (pp. 178-185 in Synthesis and Chemistry of Agrochemicals VI (ACS Symposium Series 800), American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, 2002 and PCT Publications WO 92/11249, WO 95/29171, WO 96/31467 and WO 98/05656 and are depicted in Schemes 4 and 5. The reaction steps in these Schemes proceed substantially with retention of configuration at the chiral center indicated by * .<br>
In the synthetic route shown in Scheme 4 the compound of Formula la is contacted with a protected hydrazine compound of Formula 7 to give the hydrazone of Formula 8. This hydrazone is then contacted with a fonnaldehyde equivalent (Formula 9) to form the cyclized compound of Formula 10. The protecting group is removed from the Formula 10 compound to give the compound of Formula 11, which is contacted with an acylating agent of Formula 12 to give the compound of Formula V.<br>

wherein R1 and R4 are as previously defined, R9 is a protecting group, and X1 is a leaving group.<br>
The hydrazine derivative of Formula 7 has one end protected with protecting group R9. A variety of amino protecting groups are known (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts,<br>

Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991).   A protecting group that is particularly convenient in this preparation is benzyloxycarbonyl (R9 is C(0)OCH2Ph). Generally at least a molar equivalent of the hydrazine of Formula 7 is used in relation to the ketone of Formula la.  The condensation of the hydrazine of Formula 7 <br>
5     	with the ketone of Formula la is greatly facilitated by the presence of a catalyst.   Useful catalysts for this condensation have acidic properties. Such catalysts include zeolites such as molecular sieves, as well as Lewis acids and, most commonly, protic acids.  Useful protic acids include, for example, mixed toluenesulfonic acids, jc-toluenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid or acetic acid. With strong protic acids such as the toluenesulfonic acids as little as about <br>
10      	10-12 mol % acid can provide high conversions.    As strong acids can protonate the hydrazine derivative of Formula 7, generally the molar amount of Formula 7 should at least equal the sum of the molar amount of Formula la and the molar equivalents of acid catalyst. The condensation can be conducted without solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent such as methanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane,  1,2-dichloromethane, <br>
15     	toluene and the like. Typical reaction conditions include temperatures of about 40 to 120 °C, preferably about 65 to 85 °G for about 0.5 to 25 hours. The hydrazone of Formula 8 can be recovered by standard methods such as filtration, optionally after dilution of the reaction mixture with water.    Alternatively, the reaction mixture containing the hydrazone of Formula 8 can be used directly in the next reaction step, or the hydrazone of Formula 8 can <br>
20     be extracted with solvent and the solvent extract used in the next reaction step.<br>
In the next step the hydrazone of Formula 8 is cyclized using a formaldehyde" equivalent (9) to give the compound of Formula 10. Formaldehyde equivalents include formaldehyde itself, but it readily polymerizes and is inconvenient to use. Other formaldehyde equivalents include halomethyl alkyl ethers. Most convenient of <br>
25 	formaldehyde equivalents are dialkoxymethanes, preferably di(C1-C3 alkoxy)methane, such as dimethoxymethane or diethoxymethane. The dialkoxymethane is preferably used in molar excess relative to Formula 8 and can also serve as the solvent. The reaction is optionally conducted using as co-solvent an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, a,a,a-<br>
30 		trifluoro toluene, toluene, heptane, xylenes, acetonitrile and the like. When the formaldehyde equivalent is a dialkoxymethane, the reaction is conducted in the presence of a Lewis or protic acid. Useful Lewis acids include phosphorus pentoxide, boron trifluoride or sulfur trioxide, of which 0.9 to 4.0 molar equivalents (relative to 8) is generally required for best results. Other useful Lewis acids include metal (especially scandium, ytterbium, yttrium and <br>
35 	zinc) trifluoromethanesulfonates, which can be used in amounts of 0.1 to 0.5 molar equivalents relative to the compound of Formula 8. The most preferred Lewis acids for this step are phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur trioxide; the sulfur trioxide can be in the form of a<br>
23<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
complex such as S03-DMF (DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide), and usually there is also present a protic acid scavenger such as an amine complex (e.g., S03 pyridine). A filter aid such as Celite® (diatomaceous earth) can be advantageously added to reactions employing phosphorus pentoxide. When a Lewis acid is used, halogenated solvents are most suitable. <br>
5	Useful protic acids include mineral acids such as sulfuric and sulfonic acids such as aromatic, aliphatic and polymeric sulfonic acids; preferred protic acids include ^toluenesulfonic acid, mixtures of the isomeric sulfonic acids, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acids, xylenesulfonic acids, methanesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, and camphorsulfonic acids; most preferred are jp-toluenesulfonic acid and mixtures of isomeric<br>
10 	toluenesulfonic acids. While stoichiometric or greater amounts of a protic acid can be employed, no more than a catalytic amount is needed. Preferably the amount of protic acid is about 0.01 to 0.20, more preferably between about 0.05 and 0.10, molar equivalents relative to the compound of Formula 8.<br>
For the cyclization step, typical reaction conditions include temperatures of about 0 to<br>
15     150 °C, preferably about 40 to 70 °C, more preferably about 50 to 60 °C with Lewis acids,<br>
        and with protic acids such as toluenesulfonic acid preferably about 100 to 130 °C, more<br>
          preferably about 110 to 115 °C, and pressures of about ambient pressure to 600 kPa above<br>
         ambient pressure, preferably ambient pressure to 200 kPa above ambient pressure, and most<br>
      conveniently near ambient pressure, for about 0.5 to 48 h.   The byproduct alcohol is<br>
20     preferably removed by distillation during the reaction when a non-sacrificial Lewis acid such<br>
as a rare-earth trifluoromethanesulfonate or a protic acid is employed. The cyclized product<br>
        of Formula 10 can be recovered by standard methods such as concentration, optionally<br>
      preceded by quenching with aqueous base and extraction of the organic material, and<br>
crystallization from a suitable solvent such as ethanol for the reactions involving protic acids<br>
25     or liquid or gaseous Lewis acids such as sulfur trioxide or alternatively filtration, washing<br>
with aqueous base, concentration and crystallization for the phosphorus pentoxide reactions.<br>
The reaction mixture can also be filtered and used without further purification in the next<br>
reaction step.  When metal trifluoromethanesulfonates are employed as the Lewis acid, the<br>
cyclized product can be recovered by concentrating the reaction mass, optionally diluting<br>
30     with an inert, water-immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, washing with water to remove<br>
the metal trifluoromethanesulfonates, concentrating the organic phase and inducing the<br>
product of Formula 10 to crystallize, optionally by adding a suitable solvent such as aqueous<br>
methanol, ethanol, hexane and the like.<br>
In the next step, the protecting group R9 is removed from the compound of Formula 10<br>
35     to give the compound of Formula 11. Conditions for cleaving amino protecting groups are<br>
well known (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,<br>
2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991).   The preferred benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group is<br>
24'<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
most conveniently cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The reaction involves contacting a compound<br>
of Formula 11 wherein R9 is C(0)OCH2Ph with hydrogen, from a hydrogen source or<br>
preferably molecular hydrogen itself, in the presence of a hydrogenolysis metal catalyst such<br>
as palladium, preferably supported on a substance such as charcoal, in an inert solvent such<br><br>
5     	as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, toluene or diethoxymethane.   Typical reaction conditions<br>
include temperatures of about 0 °C to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably about 15 to<br>
55 °C, more preferably about 20 to 40 °C, and pressures of close to  ambient to about 350<br>
kPa   above  ambient  pressure,   although  higher pressures   are   also   operable.     The<br>
hydrogenolysis can be conveniently operated at near ambient pressure.   Reaction time<br>
10     needed for complete conversion depends upon the usual parameters of temperature,<br>
hydrogen pressure, catalyst and reactant concentration, and typically requires 0.5 to 25<br>
hours.   The progress of the reaction can be monitored by analysis of the aliquots, or by<br>
consumption of hydrogen, as can be determined, for example, by pressure changes.   The<br>
product of Formula 11 can be recovered from solution by standard methods such as filtering<br><br>
15	and collecting the metal catalyst for recycle to subsequent batches, separating the organic<br>
phase, concentrating by removing the solvent, and inducing crystallization of Formula 11,<br>
optionally by adding an aqueous C1-C3 alcohol, acetonitrile or an aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
such as hexane.  Preferably the compound of Formula 11 is used in the next step without<br>
isolation from the organic phase solution.<br><br>
20	In the last step of Scheme 4, the compound of Formula 11 is contacted with about, a<br>
molar equivalent of the acylating agent of Formula 12 to give the oxadiazine of Formula V. The group X1 is selected from groups useful as leaving groups in nucleophilic displacement reactions. Considering ease of synthesis and cost, X1 is preferably halide, and most preferably CI. The reaction of the compound of Formula 11 with the acylating agent of <br>
25 	Formula 12 is preferably conducted in the presence of about 1.0 to 1.5 molar equivalents (relative to Formula 11) of an acid scavenger such as a trialkylamine (e.g., triethylamine), N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine or, preferably, aqueous sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, in an inert solvent such as toluene, xylene, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethoxymethane and the like. The reaction is facile<br>
30 	and can be conducted over a wide range of temperatures, e.g., about -10 to 60 °C. Typical reaction conditions include temperatures of about 0 to 30 °C. For convenience, the reaction can be conducted at ambient temperature (e.g., about 15 to 35 °C). The reaction is usually complete within several hours, and 1 to 2 h is typical. The product of Formula V can be recovered by standard methods such as washing the reaction mixture with aqueous acid or <br>
35 	aqueous sodium chloride, concentrating the organic phase and inducing crystallization of V, optionally by addition of a C1-C3 alcohol, water, alcohol-water mixtures or an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane.<br>

The last two steps of Scheme 4 can be combined in a single reaction pot by adding the acylating agent of Formula 12 and the optional acid scavenger during the hydrogenolysis of the compound of Formula 10. In this way, the compound of Formula 11 is acylated as soon as it is formed to give the product of Formula V. Typical solvents for the combined steps are methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, toluene, xylene, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like. Acid scavengers can be a tertiary amine, such as tripropylamine, tributylamine, dhsopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-diemylaniline, and the like, or a solid ionic compound such as sodium bicarbonate, calcium oxide, sodium pyrophosphate, citric acid trisodium salt and the like.<br>
The sequence of condensation and acylation steps to convert the compound of Formula la to the compound of Formula V can also be conducted in other orders, as is illustrated by Scheme 5 below. In this alternate route, the compound of Formula la is contacted with hydrazine (13) to give the hydrazone of Formula 14. This hydrazone is then contacted with an acylating agent of Formula 12 to give the compound of Formula 15, which is then contacted with a formaldehyde equivalent (9) to give the compound of Formula V.<br>

To prepare the hydrazone of Formula 14, the ketone of Formula la is contacted with <br>
20 	preferably excess equivalents (e.g., 1.1 to 10 equivalents relative to la) of hydrazine, hydrazine monohydrate, hydrazine acetate, hydrazine hydrochloride and the like. The reaction is conducted in a solvent typically comprising methanol, ethanol, 77-propanol, isopropanol and the like or acetic acid, and the reaction mixture is typically heated to the reflux temperature of the solvent. The reaction is generally complete within 24 hours. Step<br>

26<br><br>
WO 03/002255<br><br>
PCT/US02/17755<br><br>
The hydrazone of Formula 14 is then contacted with an acylating agent of Formula 12. This step is conducted using reaction conditions analogous to those already described for the conversion of the compound of Formula 11 to the compound of Formula V in Scheme 4. The product of Formula 15 is isolated by standard methods, such as aqueous work up, <br>
5 	concentration and crystallization from a suitable solvent. Example 1 of WO 96/31467 provides an example of this step.<br>
In the final step of Scheme 5, the compound of Formula 15 is treated with a<br>
formaldehyde equivalent of Formula 9.   This step is conducted using reaction conditions<br>
analogous to those already described for the conversion of the compound of Formula 8 to the<br>
10     compound of Formula 10 in Scheme 4. Example 2 of WO 96/31467 provides an example of<br>
this step.<br>
Acylating   agents   of   Formula   12   can   be   prepared   by   contacting   methyl<br>
[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamate with a base such as sodium hydride,  sodium<br>
methoxide and the like in a solvent comprising aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene<br>
15     and the like and a ethereal solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane to form the corresponding<br>
salt.  The salt is then treated with the appropriate compound having formula X1C(0)X1 to<br>
form Formula 12.  For the preferred acylating agent of Formula 12 wherein X1 is CI, the<br>
appropriate compound is phosgene (ClC(O)Cl) or a phosgene substitute such as triphosgene<br>
(also named bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate).   Most conveniently an excess of phosgene is<br>
20     used.    Suitable temperatures for this reaction are in the range of about -10 to 100 °C,<br>
preferably about -10 to 30 °C.   The reaction is usually complete within several hours.<br>
Acylating agents of Formula 12 wherein X1 is other than CI can be made from Formula 12<br>
wherein X1 is CI by nucleophilic displacement. For example, treatment with silver fluoride<br>
can give Formula 12 wherein X1 is F, and treatment with sodium iodide can give Formula 12<br>
25      wherein X1  is  I.     Methyl  [4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamate  can be made from<br>
4-(trifluoromemoxy)benzenamine by standard methods, such as contacting 4-(trifluoro-<br>
methoxy)benzenamine with methyl chloroformate in the presence of an acid scavenger such<br>
as N,N-diethylaniline, triethylamine, aqueous potassium carbonate and the like, optionally in<br>
a solvent such as diethyl ether, dichloromethane and the like. Suitable temperatures for this<br>
30     reaction are typically in the range of about 0 to 100 °C, with temperatures of about 20 to<br>
70 °C being preferred. The reaction is usually complete within several hours. Example 1 of<br>
WO 96/31467 provides an example of preparation of the preferred • acylating agent of<br>
Formula 12 wherein X1 is CI.<br>

The elution solvent was a mixture of water (pH 6.5) and acetonitrile, with the concentration of acetonitrile increased from 32% to 75% over 30 minutes to produce a solvent gradient. Detection utilized light absorption at 260 nm. The detector was calibrated using an external standard with 3-point <br>

10     of la (R1 is OCH3, R4 is CI) are based on the amount of the limiting reagent Ila used in <br>
these reactions.<br>
General procedure: A chiral zirconium complex was prepared by stirring either zirconium(IV) isopropoxide or zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate with a chiral ligand in toluene (1-2 mL) at 50 °C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo and<br>
15 	then a toluene solution (2.00 mL) of methyl 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-l-oxo-liJ-indene-2-carboxylate (0.250 g/mL; 0.500 g, 2.23 mmol of methyl 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-l-oxo-lif-indene-2-carboxylate) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was heated to the temperature indicated in Tables E14A and E14B, and then a 70% by weight solution of tert-butyl hydroperoxide in water (0.316 g, 0.340 mL, 2.46 mmol (1.10 equivalents) or <br>
20 	0.359 g, 0.386 mL, 2.79 mmol (1.25 equivalents)) was added. After the indicated time, the reaction mixture was diluted with acetonitrile (7.0 mL). The results of analysis by quantitative and chiral HPLC are shown in Tables E14A and E14B. (R6)n specified in Tables E14A and E14B are the same on each phenyl ring.<br>
