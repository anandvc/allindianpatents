				<td>The present invention relates to a frame structure for a scooter type vehicle.<br>
Background Art<br>
Such a scooter type vehicle frame structure is known from, for example, 10 Japanese Patent No. 3006214. The known structure will now be discussed with reference to Fig. 9 hereof.<br>
The conventional scooter type vehicle frame structure 310 includes a main pipe 312 extending rearwardly downwardly from a head pipe not shown. Left and right rear frames 313 are attached to a rear part of the main pipe 312<br>
15 and extend rearwardly upwardly therefrom. An engine mount member 314 is attached to the rear part of the main pipe 312 and to, front parts of the left and right rear frames 313. A floor supporting member 315 having a U-shaped cross-section extends from the engine mount member 314 in a lateral direction of a scooter type vehicle. A cross member 316 extends from the lower part of 20 the main pipe 312 in the lateral direction of the vehicle. A side frame 317 lies between an end portion of the floor supporting member 315 and an end portion of the cross member 316. A floor step 318 is mounted on the side frame 317.<br>
The floor supporting member 315 of the frame structure 310 has a portion welded to the engine mount member 314. This welded portion of the 25 floor supporting member 315 provides such an adverse influence on the engine mount member 314 as to reduce the rigidity of the engine mount member 314. One may propose to, for example, increase the rigidity of the engine mount member 314 in order to reduce this adverse influence. In this case, however,<br>
the engine mount member 314 becomes heavier to increase the overall weight of the vehicle body.<br>
Since the floor supporting member 315 is of U-shaped cross-section, the rigidity of the floor supporting member 315 is insufficient.   If the rigidity of front and rear portions of the floor supporting member is increased, the vehicle body weight would be increased.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a frame structure capable of increasing the rigidity of surroundings of the engine mount member 314 (hereinafter, referred to as "engine hanger bracket") without increasing the vehicle body weight.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a frame structure for a scooter type vehicle, comprising: a head pipe; a main pipe extending downwardly and rearwardly from the head pipe to an intermediate part of the main pipe and extending substantially horizontally from the intermediate part; left and right rear frames extending upward and rearwardly from a rear part of the main pipe; a first cross pipe coupled to a rear end of the main pipe; engine hanger brackets attached to opposite ends of the first cross pipe by welding; and floor supporting frames each welded to the engine hanger bracket within a range of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe.<br>
The first cross pipe is coupled to the rear end of the main pipe and the engine hanger bracket is welded to the outer periphery of this first cross pipe to thereby provide an increased rigidity within the range of welding.   As a result, the weight of the engine hanger bracket can be reduced.<br>
Further, since the floor supporting frame is welded to the engine hanger bracket within the range of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe, there is no possibility that the rigidity of the engine hanger bracket provided in the outside of the range of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe is affected.    Therefore, the rigidity of the engine hanger bracket can be<br>
increased.<br>
Preferably, the frame structure for a scooter type vehicle further comprises a second cross pipe disposed between and connected to front parts of the left and right rear frames, and left and right longitudinal coupling members each disposed between and connected to the first cross pipe and the second cross pipe.<br>
The front parts of the left and right rear frames are connected together by the second cross pipe disposed therebetween, and the longitudinal coupling members are disposed between the second cross pipe and the first cross pipe, whereby efficient reinforcement of surroundings of the engine hanger bracket can be achieved.   As a result, an increase in the vehicle body weight can be minimized.<br>
Preferably, the floor supporting frame has an installation area to be installed to the engine hanger bracket, and the installation area is formed in a pipe shape.<br>
Using a pipe of high flexural rigidity put on the market makes it possible to improve the rigidity of the floor supporting frame and to reduce the cost of the floor supporting frame.<br>

Fig. 4 shows a frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle 10, according to the present invention.   The frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle 10 comprises a main pipe 71, left and right rear frames 73, 73, a first cross pipe 74, a second cross pipe 76, left and right engine hanger brackets 77, 77, one pair of longitudinal coupling members 213, 213, a front floor supporting member 215, an intermediate floor supporting member 216, left and right floor supporting frames 217, 217, and left and right side frames 218, 218. The main pipe 71 extends rearwardly downwardly from a head pipe 211 and then substantially horizontally rearwardly.   The left and right rear frames 73, 73 have front ends secured to a rear portion of the main pipe 71 by welding and extend rearwardly upwardly from the rear portion of the main pipe 71.   The first cross pipe 74 has an intermediate portion connected to a rear end of the main pipe 71.   The second cross pipe 76 lies between and connected to the left and right rear frames 73, 73.   The left and right engine hanger brackets 77, 77 are attached to left and right ends of the first cross pipe 74, respectively, by welding.    The one pair of the longitudinal coupling members 213, 213 connect<br>
the first cross pipe 74 to the second cross pipe 76.   The front floor supporting member 215 is attached to a front portion of a lower part of the main pipe 71 for supporting a floor panel 222 (see Fig. 5) as will be discussed later.   The intermediate floor supporting member 216 is attached to an intermediate portion of the lower part of the main pipe 71 for supporting the floor panel 222. The left and right floor supporting frames 217, 217 are attached, by welding, to the left and right engine hanger brackets 77, 77, attached to the opposite ends of the first cross pipe 74, and within a range 274 of welding at an outer periphery of the first cross pipe 74 in order to support the floor panel 222. Each of the front supporting member 215 and the intermediate floor supporting member 216 has opposite ends secured to the left and right side frames 218, 218, respectively.   The left floor supporting frame 217 is secured to the left side frame 218 at one end thereof opposite from the other end welded to the left engine hanger bracket 77.   Similarly, the right floor supporting frame 217 is secured to the right side frame 218 at one end thereof opposite from the other end welded to the right engine hanger bracket 77.<br>
The floor supporting frame 217 is a pipe or a member formed in a pipe shape.   The floor supporting frame 217 has an installation area 219 to be installed to the engine hanger bracket 77.   The engine hanger bracket 77 has a shaft hole (bolt hole) 221 for supporting the swing type power unit 16 (see Fig. 2) in such a manner as to allow the swing movement of the power unit 16.   The left and right side frames 218, 218 has panel installation holes 255 for installing the floor panel 222 as shown in Fig. 1, and cover installation areas 226 for installing the under cover 223 as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the left and right floor panels 222 are supported by the front floor supporting member 215, the intermediate floor supporting member 216, the left and right floor supporting frames 217, 217, and left and right side frames 218, 218.<br>
The frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle 10 suspends the swing type power unit 16 in such a manner as to allow the swing movement of the power unit 16.   The engine 31 is attached through the suspension link 61 to the rear end of the main pipe 71 in such a manner as to pivot together with the rear wheel 17.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, as discussed hereinbefore, the first cross pipe 74 is coupled to the rear end of the main pipe 71.   The engine hanger brackets 77, 77 are welded to the opposite ends of the first cross pipe 74.   The engine 31 is supported on rear parts of the engine hanger brackets 77, 77.   Within the range 274 of welding (See Fig. 4) at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe 74, the floor supporting frame 217 is attached to the engine hanger bracket 77 by welding.<br>
The engine hanger bracket 77 is welded to the outer periphery of the first cross pipe 74 and hence has an increased rigidity within the range 274 of welding.   As a result, the weight of the engine hanger bracket 77 can be reduced.<br>
Further, since the floor supporting frame 217 is welded within the range 274 (see Fig. 7) of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe 76, there is no possibility that the rigidity of the engine hanger bracket 77 provided in the outside of the range 274 of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe 76 is affected.   Therefore, the rigidity of the engine hanger bracket 77 can be improved.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the hanger bracket 77 has an aperture 224 having substantially the same diameter as the floor supporting frame 217 within the range 274 of welding at the outer diameter of the first cross pipe 76.   The floor supporting frame 217 is fitted into the aperture 224.   The floor supporting frame 217 has an outer peripheral portion thereof welded to the hanger bracket 77.   In other words, when an outer diameter of the first cross pipe 74 is<br>
assumed to be D and the outer diameter of the floor supporting frame 217 is assumed to be d, the floor supporting frame 217 is welded within the range of the outer diameter D of the first cross pipe 74.<br>
In other words, the floor supporting frame 217 is welded to the engine hanger bracket 77 and within the range 274 of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe 74, whereby a force to be applied from the floor supporting frame 217 can be received within the range 274 of welding at the outer periphery of the first cross pipe 74.   As a result, even if a force from the floor panel 222 (see Fig. 5) may be exerted on the engine hanger bracket 77, an influence to be given to a portion (neighborhood of the shaft hole 221) to be supported by the swing type engine unit 16 (see Fig. 6) can be minimized.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 8, the front parts of the left and right rear frames 73, 73 are connected together by the second cross pipe 76 disposed therebetween.   The first cross pipe 74 and the second cross pipe 76 are connected to each other by the longitudinal coupling members 213, 213.   Thus, efficient reinforcement of surroundings of the engine hanger bracket 77 can be achieved.   As a result, an increase in the vehicle body weight can be minimized.<br>
The floor supporting frame 217 is a member formed into a pipe shape, and therefore, the installation area 219 of the floor supporting frame 217 to be installed to the engine hanger bracket 77 is also of pipe shape.<br>
Generally, a closed loop shape in cross-section is known to provide a high flexural rigidity or torsional rigidity and the pipe-shaped member is on the market for general purpose use.   Thus, a pipe member is used as the floor supporting frame 217, whereby it is possible to improve the rigidity of the floor supporting frame 217 and to reduce the cost of the floor supporting frame 217.<br>
In the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 1, the entire floor supporting frame 217 is in the form of a pipe, but the present invention is not hmited thereto, but<br>
only the installation area 219 may take the form of a pipe.<br>
Industrial Applicability The foregoing frame structure has a main pipe, a first cross pipe connected to a rear end of the main pipe, engine hanger brackets welded to opposite ends of the first cross pipe for supporting an engine, and left and right floor supporting frames for supporting a floor panel.   Each floor supporting frame is welded to the engine hanger bracket within a range of welding where the first cross pipe is welded to the engine hanger bracket.   With this simple arrangement, the engine hanger bracket and the floor supporting frames are reinforced to provide increased rigidity without increasing the vehicle body weight. The thus arranged frame structure is useful in a scooter type vehicle.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
