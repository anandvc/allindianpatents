				<td> <br><br><br><br>
The instant invention  relates to an actuator for a vehicle brake,  especially a disc brake,  comprising<br>
a casing which has a bottom,<br>
a shaft which is supported  in the bottom of  the  casing and  rotatable  for mechanical brake  application,<br>
a  ramp assembly which  is fixed  to the casing and designed as an annular plate,   supported on the bottom around  the  shaft, and prevented  from rotating by an off-center twist stop,   and<br>
a rotatable  ramp assembly which is arranged for axial displacement  in  the  casing and connected  to the  shaft for torque  transmission,  being supported  in such manner on the ramp assembly fixed  to  the casing  that it converts  torque app¬lied  to  it by the  shaft into an axial actuating  force.<br>
An actuator of this kind is known    from    prior    art.    There, an eccentric twist stop for the ramp assembly fixed  to the casing  is provided either in the  form of a pin produced by em¬bossing and engaging in a blind bore  formed parallel  to the axis  in  the bottom of  the  casing or a paraxial pin which has been driven into  a blind bore  in the bottom of  the casing and engages  in  an aperture which  is oblong  in  radial direction of the  ranp assembly fixed  to  the casing.     In both cases  the  shaft passes directly through the  ramp assembly which  is fixed  to the casing and  is embodied by an annular plate. As a conse¬quence,   this  ramp assembly  rests directly on the  shaft once radial clearance  has been overcome  that is  unavoidable  for manufacturing  reasons and,   upon brake  actuation,   it may accom¬modate  the  reactive moment which  is exerted on  the  ramp as¬sembly fixed  to  the  casing. This moment of   reaction  is propor¬tional,   in  first approximation,  to the actuating  torque   intro¬duced  through  the  shaft and  may reach a magnitude  at which the force by which  the  ramp assembly fixed  to  the casing  supports itself on  the  shaft gives   rise  to considerable  frictional resistance against any further rotation of  the  shaft.  The ef-<br><br>
ficiency of the known actuator thus  is noticeably  reduced. Moreover,   since  the  ramp assembly fixed to  the  casing does not come  to be  supported on  the shaft until after radial cleamace has been overcome,   the  ramps with which this  assembly is form¬ed and which usually are  shaped essentially like circular atcs,  will adopt an eccentric position at which  they no longer are aligned precisely with corresponding ramps presented  in the rotatable ramp assembly.    For this reason  roller bodies, such as balls normally placed between ramps which are mutually opposed,  no  longer are  supported,   as   intended,   on base sur¬faces but instead on lateral flanks of the   ramps.  That causes additional losses due to friction and  this  in  turn entails wear,   just like  the friction between  the  shaft and  the  ramp assembly which  is fixed to the casing. As a  result,   the ef¬ficiency of  the  actuator is  reduced.<br>
It is,   therefore,  an object of  the  instant invention  to  im¬prove  an  actuator of  the kind  specified  such  that it will have a  higher degree  of efficiency and be  less prone  to wear.<br>
The object is met,   in accordance with the  invention,   in  that the  ramp assembly which is fixed to  the casing  is centered   in the casing,  bypassing  the  shaft.<br>
In this manner the  shaft is kept free of  transverse forces which so  far were  transmitted  to the  shaft from the  ramp as¬sembly fixed  to the casing. The  centering of  the  ramp assembly fixed  to the casing  remains unaffected by  the unavoidable bearing clearance of  the  shaft and,   therefore,  can be more precise  than  is  the case with  the conventional  actuator of  the generic type  in question. For this reason the  ramps formed, on the one  hand,   in the  ranp assembly fixed  to the casing and, on the other hand,   in  the  rotatable   ramp assembly will   remain better centered with  respect to each other and consequently be less  subjected  to wear,   regardless of whether these  ranps co¬operate   in pairs directly or through  roller bodies  in between.<br><br>
An embodiment of  the  invention with which the   ramp assembly that is fixed  to  the casing  is centered  on a bearing bush by means of which the  shaft is supported  in the bottom of the casing has proved  to be particularly advantageous.    Double utilization of the bearing bush for support of  the shaft, on the one  hand,   and  for centering of the  ramp assembly fixed  to the casing,  on  the other hand,  keeps  the costs of manufacture and assembly of  the bearing bush and of  the   ramp assembly fixed  to the casing at the same level as those of the conven¬tional actuator.    And,  on  top of  that,   it is exceptionally easy to slip or press this ramp assembly in tight fit on the bear¬ing bush outside of the casing in order then to  insert both of them  into the casing  in a  single operation,  the bearing bush itself being pushed or pressed in tight fit into a bore  in the bottom of the casing.    In this context it is especially ad¬vantageous  if  the bearing bush has one portion of  smaller ou¬ter diameter which engages  in the  ramp    assembly that is fixed to the casing and another portion of greater outer diameter which  is  received  in the bottom of  the  casing.<br>
An embodiment of  the  invention will be described  in greater detail below as conpared  to the prior art assumed  to be known and with  reference  to diagrammatic drawings,   in which:<br>
Fig.   1	is an  axial sectional elevation of a  spot type disc<br>
brake comprising an actuator according to the  inven¬tion;<br>
Fig,   2	shows an enlarged cutout of fig.   1;<br>
Fig.   3	is cross section III-III of fig.  2;<br>
Fig,  4	shows a cutout similar to fig.   2 of  a conventional<br>
actuator,  and<br>
Fig.   5	is cross section V-V in fig.  4.<br>
The actuator presented  in figs.   1  to   3 is  installed  in a floating caliper 10 which forms part of a  spot type disc brake and is guided in conventional manner on a brake carrier (not shown)   so as to be displaceable parallel to the axis of a fftrtbrake disc  12.     The floating caliper 10  straddles the brake<br><br>
disc  12 as well as two brake pads  14  and   16 of which the  first one  14   is adapted  to be pressed directly by the  actuator against the brake disc  12,     That gives rise  to forces of  reac¬tion which displace  the  floating caliper 10  such that an   inte¬gral  leg  18 thereof makes  sure  that also the second brake pad 16  is urged against the brake disc  12.<br>
The actuator comprises a casing 20 which is made  in one piece, for instance by casting,  and  includes a bottom 22  and a  shell 24  formed with a cylindrical bore  26 which is open towards  the brake disc  12 and with an inlet passage  28 which will connect to a master cylinder.    A cup-shaped piston   30 having a closed outer face end wall   32 with a  surface  for abutment of  the brake pad   14  is guided  in  the cylindrical bore  26.<br>
A  shaft 34 for mechanical brake actuation  is supported so as to be   rotatable  and  axially displaceable  in a bearing bush  36 in the bottom 22  of  the  casing  20 and coaxially with  the pi¬ston   30. A  lever 38 attached  to the outer end of the  shaft 34 normally is connected,   for example,  by a Bowden cable  to a parking brake  lever or pedal. A  ramp assembly 40  fixed  to the casing and embodied by an annular plate which is pressed  on the bearing bush  36 and centered  on  the  same with  respect to the casing 20 rests against the  inside surface of the bottom 22 of  the  casing,  without touching  the  shaft 34. A  twist stop 42 prevents rotation of the   ramp assembly 40 which is  fixed  to the casing  20.     In the embodiment illustrated,   the  twist stop 42  is embodied by a notched nail driven  into a bore  in  the bottom 22 of  the casing and engaging with  radial clearance  in an off-center aperture  44  in  the   ramp assembly 40 which  is fixed  to  the casing,<br>
The  ramp assembly 40 fixed  to the casing is formed with three through-like  ramps 46 which are elongate  in circumferential direction and each  receive a  spreader 48 of spherical  shape  in the embodiment shown.  The  spreaders 48 each co-operate with a corresponding   ramp and with an adjustable   ramp assembly 50 likewise of  annulus configuration.     In the present embodiment<br><br>
this  ramp assembly  50 is  formed  in one piece with the  shaft 34.     In this  respect,  and as   regards further features,   the actuator shown corresponds to  the  one known from prior art refered to at Page  2 above.<br>
The centering on the bearing bush  36 of the   ramp assembly 40 fixed to the  casing,  which centering differs  from the known actuator,   is  illustrated  in greater detail  in  figs,   2 and   3. The bearing bush  36 has  an inner diameter which  is greater by a bearing clearance of the order of magnitude of 0,25 mm than the outer diameter of that portion of the shaft 34 which is received  in the bearing bush  36,  The bearing bush  36  is stepped at the outside;  a portion  52 of greater outer diameter is  received with little  clearance,  preferably none at all,  in a widened portion  54  of a stepped bore  in  the bottom 22 of  the casing  20 and,   together with a narrower outer portion  56 of this stepped bore,  defines a space  in which a sealing  58 is received.  The bearing bush  36  further has a portion 60 of smaller outer diameter on which the   ramp assembly 40 which  is fixed  to  the casing  is seated   in press  fit.<br>
Upon  rotation of the  shaft 34  and  consquently also of the ad¬justable   rairp assembly  50,   for mechanical actuation of the brake by means of the  lever 8,   the  spreaders 48 roll along their ramps 46 which  rise  in circumferential direction. As a result,   the  adjustable  ramp assembly  50  is urged away from the ramp assembly 40 which is fixed  to  the casing,   i,e,  to the right in figs,   1  and  2, At the  same   time,   the  spreaders 48 exert forces of  reaction on the   ramp assembly 40  fixed  to the casing.  These   reactive  forces may be divided  into components which act in parallel with the  axis,   urging  the   ramp assembly 40 against the bottom 22 of   the casing,   and   into circxamferen-tial components whose moment with  respect to axis A of the  ac¬tuator may be   represented  as  force couple F,  F',  as indicated in fig,   3.    Force F  is  received by the twist stop 42 and directed  into the bottom 22 of  the casing.  Force F'   is  taken up by the bearing bush  36 and  likewise passed on  into the bot-<br><br>
torn 22 of the  casing without affecting the  shaft  34  in any¬way.<br>
By way of comparison  figs,  4 and   5 illustrate  the  structural disposition and  the   resulting operating conditions of  the  con¬ventional actuator according  to EP 0 403 635 Bl.    With  that ar¬rangement   too,   the   reactive  force F occurring  upon brake  ap¬plication and  acting  in circumferential direction on the   ramp assembly 40  is accommodated by the  twist stop 42,     The counter-force F'  of  the  same  magnitude,  however,  acts from the  ramp assembly 40  fixed  to  the casing on the  shaft 34 which  then transmits  it through  the bearing bush  36 to  the bottom 22 of the casing.    Because  of  the  unavoidable  radial clearance with which the  shaft  34 passes  through  the  ramp assembly 40,   this ramp assembly 40  fixed  to  the casing is pivoted  about the twist stop 42 by  the  force F',   as  indicated by arrow P  in fig. 5.    The  resulting pivot angle  a,  practice,  may be an angle of 1.5     . As a  result,   the   ramps  46 of  the   ramp assembly 40  fixed to  the casing become  shifted with  respect to  the corresponding ramps of the adjustable   ramp assembly  50,     In  this context it is especially disadvantageous  that the  ramps of matching pairs become  twisted with  respect to each other about the eccentric¬ally disposed  twist stop 42  rather than the central axis A  so that they no longer can co-operate exactly as  intended with  the spreaders 48,     This undesirable  twisting and   the  likewise  un-desired  influence of  force F'  on shaft 34 are excluded with the arrangement according  to figs.   1  to  3,<br><br><br>
