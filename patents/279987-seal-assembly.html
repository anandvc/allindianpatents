				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an article for storing a fluid. More particularly, the<br>
invention is directed to a seal assembly adapted to cooperate with the article, which<br>
militates against a leakage of the fluid when an interior of the article is subjected to<br>
various temperatures and pressures.<br>
BACKGROUND SUMMARY<br>
[0002] Presently there are a variety of pressure vessels developed for use in<br>
various applications, such as those designed to contain gases for use in fuel cells.<br>
Fuel cells have been proposed as a clean, efficient and environmentally responsible<br>
power source for electric vehicles and various other applications. One example of a<br>
fuel cell is a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell. In the PEM type fuel cells,<br>
hydrogen is supplied as a fuel to an anode of the fuel cell and oxygen is supplied as<br>
an oxidant to a cathode of the fuel cell. Hydrogen is colorless, odorless, burns<br>
without producing a visible flame or radiant heat, and is difficult to contain. A<br>
common technique for storing hydrogen is in a lightweight, high pressure vessel<br>
resistant to punctures.<br>
[0003] Traditionally such vessels are divided into four types. A Type I vessel is a<br>
metal vessel. A Type II vessel is also a metal vessel, the vessel having an outer<br>
composite shell disposed on a cylindrical section thereof. A Type III vessel consists<br>
of a liner produced from a metal such as steel and aluminum, for example, and an<br>
outer composite shell that encompasses the liner and militates against damage<br>
thereto. A Type IV vessel is substantially similar to the Type III vessel, wherein the<br>
liner is produced from a plastic. Furthermore, a conceptual Type V vessel may be<br>
 <br>
developed, wherein the vessel is produced from a composite material. Each type of<br>
vessel may include at least one boss disposed therein to receive a valve.<br>
[0004] Typically, the valve disposed in the boss includes a valve housing having<br>
an external groove terminating in an annular flange. The flange is formed on the<br>
valve housing adjacent the groove to abut a liner of the vessel. An O-ring having an<br>
inner surface and an outer surface is seated in the groove of the valve housing to<br>
militate against a leakage of fluid from the vessel. The inner surface of the O-ring is<br>
adapted to abut the groove to form a substantially fluid-tight seal therebetween. The<br>
outer surface is adapted to abut the liner to form a substantially fluid-tight seal<br>
therebetween. During operation, an interior of the vessel is subjected to<br>
temperatures below a predetermined temperature such as during defueling, for<br>
example. The temperatures below the predetermined temperature cause the O-ring<br>
to contract radially inwardly onto the valve housing. Accordingly, a passage is<br>
formed between the outer surface of the O-ring and the liner, causing the leakage of<br>
fluid therethrough.<br>
[0005] In WO 2007079971, hereby incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety, a pressure vessel is disclosed for storing a liquid or gaseous media. The<br>
pressure vessel includes a plastic core having at least one neck portion. The neck<br>
portion of the core is disposed between a connecting ring and a supporting flange.<br>
The connecting ring includes an annular groove formed therein to receive an O-ring.<br>
The O-ring is adapted to be sealingly forced against the neck of the core in response<br>
to changes in a pressure of an interior of the vessel. A disadvantage of the pressure<br>
vessel is the O-ring contracts at lower temperatures to form a passage therethrough,<br>
permitting a leakage of the media therefrom.<br>
[0006] It would be desirable to produce a seal assembly which is capable of<br>
militating against a leakage of fluid at various temperatures above and below a<br>
predetermined temperature and pressures above and below a predetermined<br>
pressure, wherein the effectiveness and reliability are maximized and cost thereof is<br>
minimized.<br>
 <br>
[0007] In concordance and agreement with the present invention, a seal<br>
assembly which is capable of militating against a leakage of fluid at various<br>
temperatures above and below a predetermined temperature and pressures above<br>
and below a predetermined pressure, wherein the effectiveness and reliability are<br>
maximized and cost thereof is minimized, has surprisingly been discovered.<br>

and a second seal spaced apart from the first seal forming an interstice<br>
therebetween, the second seal having an inner sealing surface and an outer sealing<br>

 <br>
[0014] The following detailed description and appended drawings describe and<br>
illustrate an embodiment of the invention. The description and drawings serve to<br>
enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and are not intended to<br>
limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
[0015] Figs. 1 and 2 show a seal assembly 6 adapted to cooperate with an article<br>
to be sealed 8 according to an embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the seal assembly 6 is disposed in a pressure vessel 10 such as a Type IV<br>
vessel and a Type V vessel, for example. The vessel 10 includes a liner 14 adapted<br>
to contain a pressurized fluid (not shown) and an outer composite shell 16 that<br>
encompasses the liner 14 and militates against damage thereto. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the article to be sealed 8 is at least one neck portion 18 of the liner 14. The<br>
article to be sealed 8 includes an inner surface 20 and an outer surface 22.<br>
Although the article to be sealed 8 in the embodiment shown is produced from a<br>
plastic material, it is understood that other materials can be used as desired.<br>
[0016] The vessel 10 is provided with at least one boss 24 for receiving a valve<br>
25 therein. The at least one boss 24 includes an annular recess 26 formed therein.<br>
The at least one boss 24 can be produced from any conventional material such as a<br>
metal, for example, wherein the material has a coefficient of thermal expansion less<br>
than a coefficient of thermal expansion of the material used to produce the article to<br>
be sealed 8. It is understood that the term "coefficient of thermal expansion" used<br>
herein refers to a rate of expansion of a material in response to a heating and a rate<br>
of contraction of the material in response to a cooling. The seal assembly 6 is<br>
disposed in the boss 24 adjacent the valve 25.<br>
[0017] The seal assembly 6 includes a ring-shaped support member 29, a first<br>
seal 30, and a second seal 32. The second seal 32 is spaced apart from the first<br>
seal 30 to form an interstice 34 therebetween. The interstice 34 is adapted to receive<br>
the article to be sealed 8 therein. The support member 29 is generally circular in<br>
 <br>
cross-sectional shape having a passage 36 formed therethrough to facilitate fluid<br>
communication between an interior 28 of the vessel 10 and the valve 25. The<br>
support member 29 can be produced from any conventional material such as a<br>
metal, for example, wherein the material has a coefficient of thermal expansion less<br>
than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material used to produce the article<br>
to be sealed 8. The support member 29 includes a first portion 38 and a second<br>
portion 42 adapted to be joined therewith. It is understood that the first portion 38<br>
and the second portion 42 can be joined by any conventional means such as a<br>
fastener, glue, threads, and the like, for example.<br>
[0018] The first portion 38 of the support member 29 includes an outer surface 39<br>
having an annular flange 44 formed thereon. The outer surface 39 terminates in an<br>
annular shoulder 45 having an outer circumference adapted to abut the article to be<br>

portion 42 of the support member 29 thereon. The annular flange 44 includes a first<br>
surface 46 and a second surface 48. The first surface 46 is adapted to abut the<br>
article to be sealed 8 and the second surface 48 is adapted to abut the valve 25. As<br>
shown in Fig. 1, an annular gap G is formed between the first surface 46 of the<br>
annular flange 44 and the article to be sealed 8 in response to at least one of<br>
temperatures below a predetermined temperature and pressures below a<br>
predetermined pressure. In the embodiment shown, the predetermined temperature<br>
is in a range of -80 degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius and the predetermined<br>
pressure is in a range of 0.1 MPa to 87.5 MPa. It is understood that the<br>
predetermined temperature can be any temperature as desired and the<br>
predetermined pressure can be any pressure as desired. The second portion 42 of<br>
the support member 29 is adapted to militate against a displacement of the first seal<br>
30.<br>
[0019] The first seal 30 is generally circular in shape and adapted to be received<br>
on the outer surface 39 of the support member 29. The first seal 30 includes an<br>
inner surface having an inner sealing surface 52 and an outer surface having an<br>
 <br>
outer sealing surface 54. As shown in Fig. 1, the inner sealing surface 52 of the first<br>
seal 30 is adapted to abut the outer surface 39 of the support member 29 in<br>
response to at least one of temperatures below the predetermined temperature and<br>
pressures below the predetermined pressure to form a substantially fluid-tight seal<br>
therebetween. The outer sealing surface 54 of the first seal 30 is adapted to abut<br>
the article to be sealed 8 thereon in response to at least one of temperatures below<br>
the predetermined temperature and pressures below the predetermined pressure to<br>
form a substantially fluid-tight seal therebetween.<br>
[0020] As illustrated in Fig. 2, the inner sealing surface 52 of the first seal 30 is<br>
adapted to abut the outer surface 39 of the support member 29 in response to at<br>
least one of temperatures above the predetermined temperature and pressures<br>
above the predetermined pressure. An annular gap H is formed between the outer<br>
sealing surface 54 of the first seal 30 and the article to be sealed 8 in response to at<br>
least one of temperatures above the predetermined temperature and pressures<br>
above the predetermined pressure. In the embodiment shown, the first seal 30 is<br>
produced from a metal material having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than<br>
the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material used to produce the article to be<br>
sealed 8. It is understood that the first seal 30 can be produced from any<br>
conventional material as desired.<br>
[0021] The second seal 32 is generally circular in shape and adapted to be<br>
received in the annular recess 26 of the at least one boss 24. The second seal 32<br>
includes an inner surface having an inner sealing surface 56 and an outer surface<br>
having an outer sealing surface 58. As shown in Fig. 1, the inner sealing surface 56<br>
of the second seal 32 is adapted to abut the article to be sealed 8 in response to at<br>
least one of temperatures below the predetermined temperature and pressures<br>
below the predetermined pressure. An annular gap J is formed between the outer<br>
sealing surface 58 of the second seal 32 and the annular recess 26 of the at least<br>
one boss 24 in response to at least one of temperatures below the predetermined<br>
temperature and pressures below the predetermined pressure.<br>
 <br>
[0022] As illustrated in Fig. 2, the inner sealing surface 56 of the second seal 32<br>
is adapted to abut the article to be sealed 8 in response to at least one of<br>
temperatures above the predetermined temperature and pressures above the<br>
predetermined pressure to form a substantially fluid-tight seal therebetween. The<br>
outer sealing surface 58 of the second seal 32 is adapted to abut the annular recess<br>
26 of the at least one boss 24 in response to at least one of temperatures above the<br>
predetermined temperature and pressures above the predetermined pressure to<br>
form a substantially fluid-tight seal therebetween. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
second seal 32 is produced from a plastic material having a coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion similar to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material used to<br>
produce the article to be sealed 8. It is understood that the second seal 32 can be<br>
produced from any conventional material as desired.<br>
[0023] In the embodiment shown, the valve 25 includes an annular recess 60<br>
formed therein. The annular recess 60 is adapted to receive a third seal 62 therein.<br>
The third seal 62 is generally circular in shape and includes an inner surface having<br>
an inner sealing surface 64 and an outer surface having an outer sealing surface 66.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the inner sealing surface 64 of the third seal 62 is adapted to<br>
abut the annular recess 60 of the valve 25 in response to at least one of<br>
temperatures below the predetermined temperature and pressures below the<br>
predetermined pressure. An annular gap K is formed between the outer sealing<br>
surface 66 of the third seal 62 and the at least one boss 24 in response to at least<br>
one of temperatures below the predetermined temperature and pressures below the<br>
predetermined pressure.<br>
[0024] As illustrated in Fig. 2, the inner sealing surface 64 of the third seal 62 is<br>
adapted to abut the annular recess 60 of the valve 25 in response to at least one of<br>
temperatures above the predetermined temperature and pressures above the<br>
predetermined pressure to form a substantially fluid-tight seal therebetween. The<br>
outer sealing surface 66 of the third seal 62 is adapted to abut the at least one boss<br>
24 in response to at least one of temperatures above the predetermined temperature<br>
 <br>
and pressures above the predetermined pressure to form a substantially fluid-tight<br>
seal therebetween. In the embodiment shown, the third seal 62 is produced from a<br>
plastic material having a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to the coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion of the material used to produce the article to be sealed 8. It is<br>
understood that the third seal 62 can be produced from any conventional material as<br>
desired.<br>
[0025] Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the seal assembly 6 in use. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the at least one neck portion 18 is produced from high density polyethylene<br>
(HDPE) having a coefficient of thermal expansion of 0.000059 to 0.000125<br>
inch/inch/degrees Celsius. Further, the boss 24, the support member 29, and the<br>
first seal 30 are produced from a steel material having a coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion of 0.000010 to 0.000020 inch/inch/degrees Celsius. The second seal 32<br>
and the third seal 62 are produced from a plastic material having a coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion of 0.000025 to 0.000200 inch/inch/degrees Celsius.<br>
[0026] Accordingly, when the interior 28 of the vessel 10 is subjected to at least<br>
one of temperatures below the predetermined temperature and pressures below the<br>
predetermined pressure as shown in Fig. 1, the at least one neck portion 18 of the<br>
liner 14, the second seal 32, and the third seal 62 are caused to contract more than<br>
the boss 24, the support member 29, and the first seal 30. Thus, the contraction of<br>
the at least one neck portion 18 causes the gap G to be formed between the annular<br>
flange 44 of the support member 29 and the at least one neck portion 18. The inner<br>
surface 20 of the at least one neck portion 18 is caused to abut the outer sealing<br>
surface 54 of the first seal 30, militating against the leakage of fluid from the vessel<br>
10. Simultaneously, the contraction of the first seal 30 causes the inner sealing<br>
surface 52 of the first seal 30 to abut the outer surface 39 of the support member 29,<br>
militating against the leakage of fluid from the vessel 10. Further, the contraction of<br>
the second seal 32 causes the gap J to be formed between the outer sealing surface<br>
58 of the second seal 32 and the annular recess 26 of the at least one boss 24. The<br>
inner sealing surface 56 of the second seal 32 is also caused to abut the at least one<br>
 <br>
neck portion 18 of the liner 14. As illustrated, the contraction of the third seal 62<br>
causes the gap K to be formed between the outer sealing surface 66 of the third seal<br>
62 and the at least one boss 24. The inner sealing surface 64 of the third seal 62 is<br>
caused to abut the annular recess 60 of the valve 25.<br>
[0027] When the interior 28 of the pressure vessel 10 is subjected to at least one<br>
of temperatures above the predetermined temperature and pressures above the<br>
predetermined pressure as shown in Fig. 2, the at least one neck portion 18 of the<br>
liner 14, the second seal 32, and the third seal 62 are caused to expand more than<br>
the boss 24, the support member 29, and the first seal 30. Thus, the expansion of<br>
the at least one neck portion 18 causes the gap H to be formed between the outer<br>
sealing surface 54 of the first seal 30 and the at least one neck portion 18. The inner<br>
sealing surface 52 of the first seal 30 is caused to abut the outer surface 39 of the<br>
support member 29. Simultaneously, the expansion of the second seal 32 causes<br>
the outer sealing surface 58 of the second seal 32 to abut the annular recess 26 of<br>
the at least one boss 24, militating against the leakage of fluid from the vessel 10.<br>
The inner sealing surface 56 of the second seal 32 is caused to abut the at least one<br>
neck portion 18 of the liner 14, militating against the leakage of fluid from the vessel<br>
10. Moreover, the expansion of the third seal 62 causes the inner sealing surface 64<br>
of the third seal 62 to abut the annular recess 60 of the valve 25, militating against<br>
