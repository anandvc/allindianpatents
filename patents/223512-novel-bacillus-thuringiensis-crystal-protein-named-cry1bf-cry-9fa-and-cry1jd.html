				<td>INSECTICIDAL PROTEINS FROM BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to new DNA sequences encoding insecticidal proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis strains. Particularly, new DNA sequences encoding proteins designated as Cry9Fa, Cryljd, and CrylBf are provided which are useful to protect plants from insect damage. Also included herein are micro-organisms and plants transformed with at least one of the newly isolated genes so that they are useful to confer insect resistance by expression of insecticidal protein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(i) Field of the Invention:<br>
Bt or Bacillus thuringiensis is well known for its specific toxicity to insect pests, and has been used since almost a century to control insect pests of plants. In more recent years, transgenic plants expressing BT proteins were made which were found to successfully control insect damage on plants (e.g., Vaeck et al., 1987).<br>
Despite the isolation of a number of Bt crystal protein genes, the search for new genes encoding insecticidal proteins continues. Indeed, insecticidal Bt crystal proteins are known to have a relatively narrow target insect range compared to chemical insecticides. Also, having multiple toxins active on the same target insect species allows the use of proteins having different modes of action so that insect resistance development can be prevented or delayed.<br>
ii) Description of Related Art:<br>
Previously, several types of CrylB-, CrylJ-, and Cry9-proteins were identified (see Crickmore at al., 1998, incorporated herein by reference, for all details).<br><br>
The new Cryl Bf protein has the closest sequence identity with the Cryl Be protein (Payne et al, 1998, US Patent 5,723,758), but still differs in about 14 percent of the amino acid sequence of its toxic protein fragment with the toxic fragment of the Cryl Be protein. The closest sequence identity with the Cryljd toxic fragment was found in the toxic fragment of the Cryljd protein (US Patent 5,723 J58), but the toxic fragments of both proteins still differ in about 18 % of their amino acid sequence.<br>
The closest sequence identity with the Cry9Fa toxic fragment was found with the toxic fragment of the Cry9Ea1 protein as described by Midoh et al. (PCT Patent publication WO 98/26073) and Narva et al. (PCT patent publication WO 98/00546), but the toxic fragments of the Cry9Fa and Cry9Ea proteins still differ in about 21 % of their amino acid sequence.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In accordance with this invention, DNA sequences encoding new 6f toxins have been isolated and characterized. The new genes were designated crylBf, cryljd and cry9Fa, and their encoded proteins Cryl Bf, Cryljd and Cry9Fa.<br>
In accordance with this invention 'Cryl Bf protein" refers to any protein comprising the smallest protein fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 which retains insecticidal activity, particularly any protein comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 1 to the amino acid at position 640 in SEQ ID No. 2, including but not limited to the complete protein with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2. This includes hybrids or chimeric proteins comprising the smallest toxic protein fragment, as well as proteins containing at least one of the three functional domains of the toxic fragment of SEQ ID No. 2.<br>
The term "DNA/protein comprising the sequence X", as used herein, refers to a DNA or protein including or containing at least the sequence X, so that other nucleotide or amino<br><br>
acid sequences can be included at the 5' (or N-terminai) and/or 3' (or C-terminal) end, e,g. (the nucleotide sequence of) a selectable marker protein as disclosed in EP 0 193 259.<br>
In accordance with this invention, "Cry9Fa protein" or "Cry9F protein" refers to any protein comprising the smallest protein fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 6 which retains insecticidal activity, particularly any protein comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 1 to the amino acid at position 652 in SEQ ID No. 6, including but not limited to the complete protein with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 6. This includes hybrids or chimeric proteins comprising the smallest toxic protein fragment, as well as proteins containing at least one of the three functional domains of the toxic fragment of SEQ ID No. 6.<br>
In accordance with this invention, "Cry! Jd protein" refers to any protein comprising the smallest protein fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 4 which retains insecticidal activity, particularly any protein comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 1 to the amino acid at position 596 in SEQ ID No. 4, including but not limited to the complete protein with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 4. This includes hybrids or chimeric proteins comprising the smallest toxic protein fragment, as well as proteins containing at least one of the three functional domains of the toxic fragment of SEQ ID No. 4.<br>
As used herein, the terms "c/y7Ff DNA", "cry9Fa DNA", or "cryljd DNA", refer to any DNA sequence encoding the Cryl Bf, Cry9Fa, or Cryljd protein, respectively, as defined above. This includes naturally occurring, artificial or synthetic DNA sequences encoding the newly isolated proteins or their insecticidal fragments as defined above. Also included herein are DNA sequences encoding insecticidal proteins which are similar enough to the coding regions of the genomic DNA sequences deposited or the sequences provided in the sequence listing so that they can (i.e., have the ability to) hybridize to these DNA sequences under stringent hybridization conditions. Stringent hybridization conditions, as used herein, refers particularly to the following conditions: immobilizing the relevant genomic DNA sequences on a filter, and prehybridizing the filters for either 1 to 2 hours in 50 % formamide, 5 % SSPE, 2x Denhardf s reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 42 o C or 1 to 2 hours in 6x SSC, 2xDenhardt's reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 68 °C. The denatured labeled probe is then<br><br>
added directly to the prehybridization fluid and incubation is carried out for 16 to 24 hours at the appropriate temperature mentioned above. After incubation, the filters are then washed for 20 minutes at room temperature in 1x SSC, 0.1 % SDS, followed by three washes of 20 minutes each at 68 °C in 0.2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS. An autoradiograph is established by exposing the filters for 24 to 48 hours to X-ray film (Kodak XAR-2 or equivalent) at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Of course, equivalent conditions and parameters can be used in this process while still retaining the desired stringent hybridization conditions. One of such equivalent conditions includes:<br>
immobilizing the relevant genomic DNA sequences on a filter, and prehybridizing the filters for either 1 to 2 hours in 50 % formamide, 5 % SSPE, 2x Denhardf s reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 42 ° C or 1 to 2 hours in 6x SSQ 2xDenhardt's s reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 68 °C. The denatured (dig- or radio-)labeled probe is then added directly to the prehybridization fluid and incubation is carried out for 16 to 24 hours at the appropriate temperature mentioned above. After incubation, the filters are then washed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 2x SSQ 0.1 % SDS, followed by 2 washes of 30 minutes each at 68 °C in 0.5 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS. An autoradiograph is established by exposing the filters for 24 to 48 hours to X-ray film (Kodak XAR-2 or equivalent) at -70 oC with an intensifying screen<br>
"Insecticidal activity" of a protein, as used herein, means the capacity of a protein to kill insects when such protein is fed to insects, preferably by expression in a recombinant host such as a plant. "Insect-controlling amounts" of a protein; as used herein, refers to an amount of protein which is sufficient to limit damage on a plant by insects feeding on such plant to commercially acceptable levels, e.g. by killing the insects or by inhibiting the insect development or growth in such a manner that they provide less damage to a plant and plant yield is not significantly adversely affected.<br>
In accordance with this invention, insects susceptible to the new Cry proteins of the invention are contacted with this protein in insect-controlling amounts, preferably insecticidal amounts.<br>
"Cry protein" or "Cry protein of this invention", as used herein, refers to any one of the new proteins isolated in accordance with this invention and identified herein as Cryl Bf, Cry9Fa, or Cryljd protein. A Cry protein, as used herein, can be a protein in the full length size, also named a protoxin, or can be in a slightly or fully (e.g., N- and C-terminal truncation)<br><br>
truncated form as long as the insecticidal activity is retained, or can be a combination of different proteins or protein parts in a hybrid or fusion protein.   A "Cry protoxin" refers t4 the full length crystal protein as it is encoded by the naturally-occurring Bt DNA sequence, a "Cry toxin" refers to an insecticidal fragment thereof, particularly the smallest toxic fragment thereof, typically in the molecular weight range of about 60 to about 80 kD as determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. A "cry gene" or "c/y DNA", as used herein, is a DNA sequence encoding a Cry protein in accordance with this invention, referring to any of the crylBff cry9Fa, and cryljd DNA sequences defined above.<br>
The "smallest toxic fragment" of a Cry protein, as used herein, is that fragment as can be obtained by trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion of the full length solubilized crystal protein that retains toxicity, or that toxic protein fragment encoded by DNA fragments of the Cry protein. This protein will mostly have a short N-terminal and a long C-terminal truncation compared to the protoxin. Although for recombinant expression, toxic fragments starting at or around original amino acid position 1 are a more preferred embodiment in accordance with this invention, it should be noted that besides a C-terminal truncation, some N-terminal amino acids can also be deleted while retaining the insecticidal character of the protein. The N-terminal end of the smallest toxic fragment is conveniently determined by N-terminal amino acid sequence determination of trypsin- or chymotrypsin-treated soluble crystal protein by techniques routinely available in the art.<br>
Dna encoding the Cry proteins of this invention can be isolated in a conventional manner from the £ coli strains, deposited on November 25, 1999 at the BCCM-LMBP under accession numbers LMBP 3983, LMBP 3984, LMBP 3985 and LMBP 3986. The encoded Cry proteins can be used to prepare specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in a conventional manner (Hofte et al., 1988). The toxin forms can be obtained by protease (e.g., trypsin) digestion of the Cry protoxins.<br>
The DNA sequences encoding the Cry proteins can be isolated in a conventional manner from the respective strains or can be synthesized based on the encoded amino acid sequence.<br>
The DNA sequences encoding the Cry proteins of the invention were identified by digesting total DNA from isolated Bt strains with restriction enzymes; size fractionating the DNA fragments, so produced, into DNA fractions of 5 to 10 Kb; ligating these fractions to<br><br>
cloning vectors; screening the E coli, transformed with the cloning vectors, with a DNA probe that was constructed from a region of known Bt crystal protein genes or with a DNA probe based on specific PCR fragments generated from Bt DNA using primers corresponding to known Bt crystal protein genes.<br>
Also, DNA sequences for use in this invention can be made synthetically. Indeed, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, some amino acid codons can be replaced with others without changing the amino acid sequence of the protein. Furthermore, some amino acids can be substituted by other equivalent amino acids without significantly changing the insecticidal activity of the protein. Also, changes in amino acid sequence or composition in regions of the molecule, different from those responsible for binding and toxicity (e.g., pore formation) are less likely to cause a difference in insecticidal activity of the protein. Such equivalents of the gene include DNA sequences hybridizing to the DNA sequence of the Cry toxins or protoxins of SEQ ID. No. 2, 4, or 6 under stringent conditions and encoding a protein with the same insecticidal characteristics as the (pro)toxin of this invention, or DNA sequences encoding proteins with an amino acid sequence identity of at least 85 %, preferably at least 90 %, most preferably at least 95 %, with the protein toxin form (from the N-terminus to 2 amino acids beyond conserved sequence block 5 as defined in Schnepf et al., 1998) or with the protein protoxin form of the Cryl Bf, Cry9FA or Cryljd proteins of this invention, as determined using the GAP program of the Wisconsin package of GCG (Madison, Wisconsin, USA, version 10.0; GCG defaults were used within the GAP program; for the amino acid sequence comparisons, the blosum62 scoring matrix was used).<br>
Of course, any other DNA sequence differing in its codon usage but encoding the same protein or a similar protein with substantially the same insecticidal activity, can be constructed, depending on the particular purpose. It has been described in prokaryotic and eucaryotic expression systems that changing the codon usage to that of the host cell is desired for gene expression in foreign hosts (Bennetzen &amp; Hall, 1982; Itakura, 1977). Furthermore, Bt crystal protein genes are known to have no bias towards eucaryotic codons, and to be very AT-rich (Adang et aL, 1985, Schnepf et al., 1985). Codon usage tables are available in the literature (Wada et al., 1990; Murray et al., 1989) and in the major DNA sequence databanks (e.g. EMBL at Heidelberg, Germany). Accordingly, synthetic DNA sequences can be constructed so that the same or substantially the same proteins are produced. It is evident that several DNA sequences can be devised once the amino acid sequence of the Cry proteins of this invention is known. Such other DNA sequences include<br><br>
synthetic or semi-synthetic DNA sequences that have been changed in order to inactivate certain sites in the gene, e.g. by selectively inactivating certain cryptic regulatory or processing elements present in the native sequence as described in PCT publications WO 91/16432 and WO 93/09218, or by adapting the overall codon usage to that of a more related host organism, preferably that of the host organism in which expression is desired. When making such genes, the encoded amino acid sequence should be retained to -the maximum extent possible, although truncations or minor replacements or additions of amino acids can be done as long as the toxicity of the protein is not negatively affected.<br>
Small modifications to a DNA sequence such as described above can be routinely made by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (Ho et al.,1989, White et al., 1989).<br>
With the term "substantially the same", when referring to a protein, is meant to include a protein that differs in some amino acids, or has some amino acids added (e.g. a fusion protein, see Vaeck et al., 1987) or deleted (e.g. N- or C-terminal truncation), as long as the protein has no major difference in its insecticidal activity.<br>
The term "functional domain" of a Cry toxin as used herein means any part(5) or domain(s) of the toxin with a specific structure that can be transferred to another (Cry) protein for providing a new hybrid protein with at least one functional characteristic (e.g., the binding and/or toxicity characteristics) of the Cry toxin of the invention (Ge et al., 1991). Such parts can form an essential feature of the hybrid Bt protein with the binding and/or toxicity characteristics of the Cry protein of this invention. Such a hybrid protein can have an enlarged host range, an improved toxicity and/or can be used in a strategy to prevent insect resistance development (European Patent Publication ("EP") 408 403; Visser et al., 1993).<br>
The 5 to 10 Kb fragments, prepared from total DNA of the Bt strains of the invention, can be ligated in suitable expression vectors and transformed in E coli and the clones can then be screened by conventional colony immunoprobing methods (French et al., 1986) for expression of the toxin with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies raised against the Cry proteins, or by hybridization with DNA probes.<br>
Also, the 5 to 10 Kb fragments, prepared from total DNA of the Bt strains of the invention or fragments thereof cloned and/or subcloned in E.coli, can be ligated in suitable Bt shuttle vectors (Lereclus et al., 1992) and transformed in a crystal minus Bf-mutant. The clones are then screened for production of crystals (detected by microscopy) or crystal proteins (detected by SDS-PAGE).<br><br>
The genes encoding the Cry proteins of this invention can be sequenced in a conventional manner (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980; Sanger, 1977) to obtain the DNA sequence. Sequence comparisons indicated that the genes are different from previously described genes encoding protoxins and toxins with activity against Lepidoptera (Hofte and Whiteley, 1989; Crickmore, et al., 1998); and the December 15, 1999 and October 16, 2000 updates on the Bt nomenclature website corresponding to the Crickmore et al. (1998) publication, found at:<br>
http://epunix.biols.susx.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/index.htmI<br>
An insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequences, encoding an insecticidally effective portion of the newly identified Cry protein protoxin forms, can be made in a conventional manner after sequence analysis of the gene. In such fragments, it is preferred that at least the sequence up to the C-terminal end of conserved sequence block 5 of Bt proteins (Hofte &amp; Whiteley, 1989; Schnepf et al,, 1998), preferably up to two amino acids C-terminal of the conserved sequence block 5, is retained. The amino acid sequence of the Cry proteins can be determined from the DNA sequence of the isolated DNA sequences. By "an insecticidally effective part" of DNA sequences encoding the Cry protein, also referred to herein as 'truncated gene" or 'truncated DNA", is meant a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide which has fewer amino acids than the Cry protein protoxin form but which is insecticidal to insects.<br>
In order to express all or an insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequence encoding a Cry protein of this invention in E. coli, in other Bf strains and in plants, suitable restriction sites can be introduced, flanking the DNA sequence. This can be done by site-directed mutagenesis, using well-known procedures (Stanssens et al., 1989; White et al., 1989). In order to obtain improved expression in plants, the codon usage of the cry gene or insecticidally effective cry gene part of this invention can be modified to form an equivalent, modified or artificial gene or gene part in accordance with PCT publications WO 91/16432 and WO 93/09218; EP 0 358 962 and EP 0 359 472, or the Sf genes or gene parts can be inserted in the chloroplast genome and expressed there using a chloropast-active promoter (e.g., Mc Bride et al., 1995). For obtaining enhanced expression in monocot plants such as corn, a monocot intron also can be added to the chimeric gene, and the DNA sequence of the cry gene or its insecticidal part of this invention can be further changed in a translationally neutral manner, to modify possibly inhibiting DNA sequences present in the gene part by means of site-directed intron insertion and/or by introducing changes to the<br><br>
codon usage, e.g., adapting the codon usage to that most preferred by the specific plant (Murray et al., 1989) without changing significantly the encoded amino acid sequence. A<br>
Furthermore, the binding properties of the Cry proteins of the invention can be evaluated, using methods known in the art (Van Rie et al., 1990), to determine if the Cry proteins of the invention bind to sites on the insect midgut that are different from those recognized by other, known Cry or other Bf proteins. Bf toxins with different binding site^ in relevant susceptible insects are very valuable to replace known Bt toxins to which insects may have developed resistance, or to use in combination with i5f toxins having a different mode of action to prevent or delay the development of insect resistance against Bt toxins, particularly when expressed in a plant. Because of the characteristics of the newly isolated Bf toxins, they are extremely useful for transforming plants, e.g. monocots such as corn or rice and vegetables such as Brassica species plants, to protect these plants from insect damage.<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part or its equivalent, preferably the cry chimeric gene, encoding an insecticidally effective portion of the Cry protoxin, can be stably inserted in a conventional manner into the nuclear genome of a single plant cell, and the so-transformed plant cell can be used in a conventional manner to produce a transformed plant that is insect-resistant In this regard, a disarmed Ti-plasmid, containing the insecticidally effective cry gene part, in Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be used to transform the plant cell, and thereafter, a transformed plant can be regenerated from the transformed plant cell using the procedures described, for example, in EP 0 116 718, EP 0 270 822, PCT publication WO 84/02913 and published European Patent application ("EP") 0 242 246 and in Gould et al. (1991). Preferred Ti-plasmid vectors each contain the insecticidally effective c/y gene part between the border sequences, or at least located to the left of the right border sequence, of the T-DNA of the Ti-plasmid. Of course, other types of vectors can be used to transform the plant cell, using procedures such as direct gene transfer (as described, for example in EP 0 233 247), pollen mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 270 356, PCT publication WO 85/01856, and US Patent 4,684,611), plant RNA virus-mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 067 553 and US Patent 4,407,956), liposome-mediated transformation (as described, for example in US Patent 4,536,475), and other methods such as the recently described methods for transforming certain lines of corn (Fromm et al., 1990; Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990) and rice (Shimamoto<br><br>
et al.,  1989; Datta et a!.,  1990) and the recently described method for transforming monocots generally (PCT publication WO 92/09696).<br>
The resulting transformed plant can be used in a conventional plant breeding scheme to produce more transformed plants with the same characteristics or to introduce the insecticidally effective cry gene part in other varieties of the same or related plant species. Seeds, which are obtained from the transformed plants, contain the insecticidally effective cry gene part as a stable genomic insert. Cells of the transformed plant can be cultured in a conventional manner to produce the insecticidally effective portion of the Cry protoxin, preferably the Cry toxin, which can be recovered for use in conventional insecticide compositions against Lepidoptera (US Patent 5,254,799). In accordance with this invention, plants or seeds of the invention can be used to obtain resistance to insects, e.g. by sowing or planting in a field wherein damaging insects usually occur, said seeds or plants. Methods for obtaining insect resistance and methods for obtaining improved yield or reduced insect damage are thus provided in accordance with the invention by planting or sowing in a field, preferably a field wherein damaging insects feeding on such plants usually occur or are expected to occur at levels which provide economic damage to the plants, the plants of seeds of the invention producing the Cry proteins of the invention.<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part, preferably the truncated cry gene, is inserted in a plant cell genome so that the inserted gene is downstream (i.e., 3') of, and under the control of, a promoter which can direct the expression of the gene part in the plant cell. This is preferably accomplished by inserting the cry chimeric gene in the plant cell genome, particularly in the nuclear or chloroplast genome. Preferred promoters include: the strong constitutive 35S promoters (the "35S promoters") of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) of isolates CM 1841 (Gardner et al., 1981), CabbB-S (Franck et al., 1980) and CabbB-JI (Hull and Howell, 1987); promoters from the ubiquitin family (e.g., the maize ubiquitin promoter of Christensen et al., 1992, see also Cornejo et al., 1993), the gos2 promoter (de Pater et al., 1992), the emu promoter (Last et al., 1990), rice actin promoters such as the promoter described by Zhang et aL (1991); and the TR1' promoter and the TR2' promoter (the "TRV promoter" and 'TR2' promoter", respectively) which drive the expression of the 1' and 2' genes, respectively, of the T-DNA (Velten et al., 1984). Alternatively, a promoter can be utilized which is not constitutive but rather is specific for one or more tissues or organs of the plant (e.g., leaves and/or roots) whereby the inserted cry gene part is expressed only in cells of the specific tissue(s) or<br><br>
organ(s). For example, the insecticidally effective cry gene part could be selectively expressed in the leaves of a plant (e.g., corn, cotton) by placing the insecticidally effective gene part under the control of a light-inducible promoter such as the promoter of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene of the plant itself or of another plant such as pea as disclosed in US Patent 5,254,799. Another alternative is to use a promoter whose expression is inducible (e.g., by temperature, wounding or chemical factors).<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part is inserted in the plant genome so that the inserted gene part is upstream {i.e., 5') of suitable 3' end transcription regulation signals (i.e., transcript formation and polyadenylation signals). This is preferably accomplished by inserting the cry chimeric gene in the plant cell genome. Preferred polyadenylation and transcript formation signals include those of the octopine synthase gene (Gielen et al., 1984) and the T-DNA gene 7 (Velten and Scheil, 1985), which act as 3'-untranslated DNA sequences in transformed plant cells.<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part can optionally be inserted in the plant genome as a hybrid gene (US Patent 5,254,799; Vaeck et al., 1987) under the control of the same promoter as a selectable marker gene, such as the neo gene (EP 0 242 236) encoding kanamycin resistance, so that the plant expresses a ftjsion protein.<br>
All or part of the cry gene, encoding an anti-Iepidopteran protein, can also be used to transform other bacteria, such as a B. thuringiensis which has insecticidal activity against Lepidoptera or'Coleoptera. Thereby/a transfornried Bt strain can be produced which is useful for combatting a wide spectrum of lepidopteran and coleopteran insect pests or for combatting additional lepidopteran insect pests. Transformation of bacteria, such as bacteria of the genus Agrobacterium, Bacillus or Escherichia, with all or part of the cry gene of this invention, incorporated in a suitable cloning vehicle, can be carried out in a conventional manner, preferably using conventional electroporation techniques as described in Mahillon et al. (1989) and in PCT Patent publication WO 90/06999.<br>
Transformed Bacillus species strains containing the c/y gene of this invention can be fermented by conventional methods (Dulmage, 1981; Bernhard and Utz, 1993) to provide high yields of cells. Under appropriate conditions which are well understood (Dulmage, 1981), these strains each sporulate to produce crystal proteins containing the Cry protoxin in high yields.<br><br>
An insecticidal, particularly anti-Iepidopteran, composition of this invention can be formulated in a conventional manner using the microorganisms transformed with the ay gene, or preferably their respective Cry proteins or the Cry protoxfn, toxin or insecticidally effective protoxin portion as an active ingredient, together with suitable carriers, dityents, emulsifiers and/or dispersants (e.g., as described by Bernhard and Utz, 1993). This insecticide composition can be formulated as a wettable powder, pellets, granules or dust or as a liquid formulation with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents as a foam, gel, suspension, concentrate, etc.<br>
A method for controlling insects, particularly Lepidoptera, in accordance with this invention can comprise applying (e.g., spraying), to a locus (area) to be protected, an insecticidal amount of the Cry proteins or host cells transformed with the cry gene of this invention. The locus to be protected can include, for example, the habitat of the insect pests or growing vegetation or an area where vegetation is to be grown.<br>
To obtain the Cry protoxin or toxin, cells of the recombinant hosts expressing the Cry protein can be grown in a conventional manner on a suitable culture medium and then lysed using conventional means such as enzymatic degradation or detergents or the like. The protoxin can then be separated and purified by standard techniques such as chromatography, extraction, electrophoresis, or the like. The toxin can then be obtained by trypsin digestion of the protoxin.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Characterization of the strains.<br>
The BtS02072BG strain was isolated from a grain dust sample collected in Santo Tomas la Union, llocos, Philippines. The BtS02739C strain was isolated from a grain dust sample collected in Lucena City, South Tagalog, Philippines.<br>
Each strain can be cultivated on conventional standard media, preferably T3 medium (tryptone 3 g/I, tryptose 2 g/1, yeast extract 1.5 g/l, 5 mg MnCl2, 0.05 M Na2HPO4.2H2O, 0.05 M NaH2PO4.H20, pH 6.8 and 1.5% agar), preferably at 28 °C. For long term storage, it is preferred to mix an equal volume of a spore-crystal suspension with an equal volume of 50% glycerol and store this at -70 °C or lyophilize a spore-crystal suspension. For sporulation, growth on T3 medium is preferred for 72 hours at 28 °C, followed by storage at 4 °C. The crystal proteins produced by the strains during sporulation are packaged in crystals.<br><br>
Example 2 : Insecticidal activity of the BtS02Q72BG and BtS02739C strains against selected lepidopteran insect species.<br>
Toxicity assays were performed on neonate larvae of Helicoverpa zea, Heliothis virescens, Ostrinia nubilalis, Spodoptera frugiperda and Sesamia nonagrioides fed on an artificial diet layered with spore-crystal mixtures from either BtS02072BG or BtS02739Q at about 109 spore-crystals per ml.<br>
The artificial diet (Vanderzant, 1962) was dispensed in wells of Costar 24-well plates for tests on H. zea, H. virescens and O. nubilalis, 50 microliter of the spore-crystal mixture was applied on the surface of the diet and dried in a laminar air flow. For tests on H. zea, H. virescenSf one larva was placed in each well and 20 larvae were used per sample. For tests on O. nubilalis, 2 larvae were placed in each well and 24 larvae were used per sample. The artificial diet was dispensed in wells of Costar 48-well plates for tests on S. frugiperda and S. nonagrioides, 25 microliter of the spore-crystal mixture was applied on the surface of the diet and dried in a laminar air flow. One larva was placed in each well and 18 larvae were used per sample. Dead and living larvae were counted on the seventh day. The percentage of dead larvae are shown in Table I below.<br><br>
The BtS02739C genes were detected by PCR using degenerate primers targeting conserved regions in known cry  genes.   The resulting amplification product was purified<br><br>
using the Wizard PCR preps (Promega) purification system and iigated into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The ligation mixture was electroporated into E coli M101. A miniprep was made of at least 40 insert-containing transformants, and digests were performed with selected restriction enzymes. Following electrophoresis of the digested miniprep ONA, different DNA fragment patterns could be observed. For each pattern at least one colony was selected. An appropriate DNA prep was made in order to determine the sequence of the insert of the plasmid present in each selected colony. Alignment of the determined sequences of the amplification products with publicly available cry sequences demonstrates that strain BtS02739C contains a novel cryl]- type gene and a novel cry9- type gene.<br>
The BtS02072BG gene was detected as follow. First, a PCR was performed using degenerate crystal protein gene primers on strain BtS02419j. The resulting amplification product was used as template in a secondary PCR using degenerate crystal protein primers<br>
The resulting amplification product was purified using the Wizard PCR preps (Promega) purification system and Iigated into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The ligation mixture was electroporated into XL! Blue E coli A miniprep was made of at least 40 insert-containing transformants, and digests were performed with selected restriction enzymes. Following electrophoresis of the digested miniprep DNA, different DNA fragment patterns could be observed. For each pattern at least one colony was selected. An appropriate DNA prep was made in order to determine the sequence of the insert of the plasmid present in each selected colony.<br>
From the cloned amplification products from strain BtS02419j, a sequence was<br>
found to be identical to the corresponding fragment of cry1Bel, except for one nucleotide<br>
difference. Next, primers were selected to evaluate the presence of a cry sequence similar<br>
to that of the sequenced cry gene fragment from BtS02419J in a number of Bt strains, one of<br>
them being strain BtS02072BG. These primers had the following sequence (5' to 3'):<br>
Forward primer: cryl B.fw: CAG TCC AAA CGG GTA TAA AC<br>
Reverse primer:  B.R:	CTG CTT CGA AGG TTG CAG TA<br>
Alignment of the determined sequences from the amplification products with publicly available cry sequences demonstrates that strain BtS02072BG contains a novel crylB-type gene.<br>
Example 4 : Cloning and expression of the cry genes<br><br>
In order to isolate the full length cryl]- type and cry9- type gene from BtS02789C, and the cry1B- type gene from BtS02072BC, total DNA from these strains was prepared and partially digested with Sau3A. The digested DNA was size fractionated on a sucrose gradient and fragments ranging from 5 Kb to 10 Kb were ligated to the BamH1-digested and TsAP (thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase)- treated cloning vector pliCl 9 (Yannisch-Perron et al, 1985). The ligation mixture was electroporated in E coli XLI-Blue or E co//JM109 cells. Transformants were plated on LB-triacillin plates containing Xgal and IPTG and white colonies were selected to be used in filter hybridization experiments. Recombinant E.coli clones containing the vector were then screened with the appropriate DIG labeled probes. These probes were prepared as follows. First, a PCR was performed using as template cells from a recombinant £ coli clone containing a plasmid harboring the particular cry gene fragment, previously amplified using appropriate primers as shown in Table 11.<br><br>
The resulting amplification product was gel-purified and used as template in a secondary PCR reaction using DIG- labeled dNTPs. An appropriate amount of this amplification product was used in hybridization reactions.<br>
Colony hybridization for strain BtS02739C was performed with a mixture of the crylJ- type probe and the cry9' type probe. Positive colonies were then hybridized with each probe separately. Colony hybridization for strain BtS02072BG was performed with the crylB- type<br><br>
probe. Following identification of a positive colony containing a plasmid harboring the full length cry gene, the sequence of the cry gene was determined using the dye terminator labeling method and a Perkin Elmer ABI Prism-377 DNA sequencer for both strands. Upon DNA sequencing, the genes were termed as follows: the crylj- type and cry9- type gene from BtS02739C were named cryljd and cry9Fa, respectively, and the crylB- type gene from BtS02072BG was named crylBf,<br>
The genomic sequences of the isolated cryljdf cry9Fa, and cryWf genes, as well as the proteins they encode, are shown In the Sequence Listing included in this application. Comparison of the sequences with known Cry DNA or protein sequences showed that the sequences are novel and differ in a substantial number of nucleotides or amino acids from known Bt genes and proteins. Tables lll-V provide an overview of the sequence identity with respect to the coding regions of the most similar genes and proteins (both protoxin as toxin forms) as determined using the GAP program of the Wisconsin package of GCG (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) version 10,0. GCG defaults were used within the GAP program. For nucleic acid sequence comparisons, the nwsgapdna scoring matrix was used, for amino acid sequence comparisons, the blosum52 scoring matrix. The toxin form, as used in Tables lll-V, refers to the protein starting at the first amino acid and ending two amino acids beyond the last amino acid (usually a proline) of conserved sequence block 5, as defined in Schnepf et al. (1998). The protoxin form refers to the entire protein or coding region of the Bt protein/gene.<br><br><br><br>
Genomic clones of the newly isolated genes have been deposited at the BCCM^^-LMBP (Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms - Laboratorium voor Moleculaire Biologie- PlasmidencoIIectie, University of Gent, K.L. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium) under the following accession numbers:<br>
- LMBP 3983 for f coli JM109 containing plasmid pUC2739ai1 comprising the cryljd gene, deposited on November 25, 1999 (this gene can be isolated from this plasmid on an about 8.4 kb DNA fragment by digestion with Xhol and Smal);<br><br>
-	LMBP 3984 for E co//JM109 containing plasmid pUC2739a9Fal comprising the cry8Fa gene, deposited on November 25, 1999 (this gene can be isolated from this plasmid on an about 8 kb DNA fragment by digestion with Sac! and PstI); and<br>
-	LMBP 3986 for E coli XLI Blue containing plasmid pUC2072BG/lBf1 comprising the crylBf gene, deposited on November 25, 1999 (this gene can be isolated from this plasmid on an about 7 kb DNA fragment by digestion with Sad and Sail).<br>
Example 5: insecticidal activity of the cry genes:<br>
The insert containing the cry9Fa gene was subcloned into a suitable shuttle vector and the resulting plasmid pSL2739C/9Fa1 was introduced by routine procedures into a crystal-minus Bf strain. The crystal protein produced by a sporulated culture of this recombinant Bt strain was tested on neonate larvae of H. virescens and O. nubilalis at a concentration of about 109 particles/ml. On O. nubilalis larvae, 100% mortality was observed, whereas 72% mortality was observed on H. virescens larvae, whereas after treatment with the crystal-minus control strain all larvae survived.<br>
The insert containing the crylBfgene was subcloned into a suitable shuttle vector and the resulting plasmid pSL2072BG/1Bf was introduced by routine procedures into a crystal-minus Bf strain. The crystal protein produced by a sporulated culture of this recombinant Bf strain was tested on larvae of Sesam/a nonagrioides, Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea and O. nubilalis at different concentrations. Significant high mortality of the Cryl Bf toxin was observed on /-/. virescens^ Ostrinia nubilialis and Sesamia nonagrioides, while lower toxicity was found on Helicoverpa zea. After treatment with the crystal-minus control strain all larvae survived.<br>
The insert containing the crylJd gene was subcloned into a suitable shuttle vector and the resulting plasmid pG!2739C/1Jd was introduced by routine procedures into a crystal-minus Bf strain. The crystal protein produced by a sporulated culture of this recombinant Bf strain is tested on larvae of Heliothis virescens Bf different concentrations, and significant mortality of the Cryl Jd toxin was observed. After treatment with the crystal-minus control strain all larvae survived.<br><br>
Example 6; production of the novel Cry proteins in transformed plants.<br>
Chimeric genes encoding the truncated forms of the Cryl Bf, Cryl jd, and Cry9Fa proteins are<br>
made as described in EP 0 193 259 and published PCT patent application WO 94/12264,<br>
using the CaMV 35S (Hull and Howell, 1987) and ubiquitin (Christensen et ah, 1992)<br>
promoters. Preferably, the codon usage of the open reading frame is adapted to that of the<br>
host plant so as to optimize expression efficiency, as described in published PCT patent<br>
application WO 94/12264.<br>
Rice, cotton and corn cells are transformed with the resulting chimeric genes.<br>
Corn cells are stably transformed by either Agrobacter/t/n7-mediated transformation (Ishida et<br>
al., 1996, and U.S. Patent No. 5,591,616) or by electroporation using wounded and<br>
enzyme-degraded embryogenic callus, as described in WO 92/09696 or US Patent<br>
5,641,664 (incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Cotton cells are stably transformed by /Agrobacter/um-mediated transformation (Umbeck et<br>
a!., 1987, Bio/Technology 5, 263-266; US Patent 5,004,863, incorporated herein by<br>
reference).<br>
Rice cells are stably transformed with the method described in published PCT patent<br>
application WO 92/09696.<br>
Regenerated transformed corn, cotton and rice plants are selected by ELISA, Northern and<br>
Southern blot and insecticidal effect. Chimeric gene-containing progeny plants show<br>
improved resistance to insects compared to untransformed control plants with appropriate<br>
segregation of insect resistance and the transformed phenotype. Protein and RNA<br>
measurements show that increased insect resistance is linked with higher expression of the<br>
novel Cry protein in the plants.<br><br>
