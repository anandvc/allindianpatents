				<td>ACETYL 2-HYDROXY-l, 3-DIAMINOALKANES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVEEETION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to acetyl 2-hydroxy-l,3-<br>
diaminoalkanes and to such compounds that are useful in the<br>
treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related diseases. More<br>
specifically, it relates to such compounds that are capable of<br>
inhibiting beta-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves amyloid<br>
precursor protein to produce amyloid beta peptide (A beta), a<br>
major component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of<br>
Alzheimer's sufferers.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative<br>
diseast of the brain primarily associated with aging.<br>
Cliniqpal presentation of AD is characterized by loss of.<br>
memory., cognition, reasoning, judgment, and orientation. As<br>
the Msease progresses, motor, sensory, and linguistic<br>
abilities are also affected until there is global impairment<br>
of multiple cognitive functions. These cognitive losses occur<br>
gradually, but typically lead to severs impairment and<br>
eventual death in the range of four to twelve years.<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two major<br>
pathologic observations in the brain: neurofihrillary tangles<br>
and beta amyloid (or neuritic) plaques, comprised<br>
predominantly of an aggregate of a peptide fragment know as A<br>
beta. Individuals with AD exhibit characteristic beta-amyloid<br>
deposits in the brain (beta amyloid plaques) and in cerebral<br>
blood vessels (beta amyloid angiopathy) as well as<br>
neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles occur not<br>
only in Alzheimer's disease but also in other dementia-<br>
inducing disorders. On autopsy, large numbers of these<br>
lesions are generally found in areas of the human brain<br>
important for memory and cognition.<br>
Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restricted<br>
anatomical distribution are found in the brains of most aged<br>
humans who do not have clinical AD. Amyloidogenic plaques and<br>
 amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains of<br>
individuals with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome), Hereditary<br>
Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type (HCHWA-<br>
D), and other neurodegenerative disorders. Beta-amyloid is a<br>
defining feature of AD, now believed to be a causative<br>
precursor or factor in the development of disease. Deposition<br>
of A beta in areas of the brain responsible for cognitive<br>
activities is a major factor in the development of AD. Beta-<br>
amyloid plaques are predominantly composed of amyloid beta<br>
peptide (A beta, also sometimes designated betaA4). A beta<br>
peptide is derived by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor<br>
protein (APP) and is comprised of 3 9-42 amino acids. Several<br>
proteases called secretases are involved in the processing of<br>
APP.<br>
Cleavage of APP at the N-terminus of the A beta peptide<br>
by beta-secretase and at the C-terminus by one or more gamma-<br>
secretases constitutes the beta-amyloidogenic pathway, i.e.<br>
the pathway by which A beta is formed. Cleavage of APP by<br>
alpha-secretase produces alpha-sAPP, a secreted form of APP<br>
that does not result in beta-amyloid plaque formation. This<br>
alternate pathway precludes the formation of A beta peptide.<br>
A description of the proteolytic processing fragments of APP<br>
is found, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,441,870;<br>
5,721,130; and 5,942,400.<br>
An aspartyl protease has been identified as the enzyme<br>
responsible for processing of APP at the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site. The beta-secretase enzyme has been disclosed<br>
using varied nomenclature, including BACE, Asp, and Memapsin.<br>
See, for example, Sinha et al., 1999, Nature 402:537-554<br>
(p501) and published PCT application WO00/17369.<br>
Several lines of evidence indicate that progressive<br>
cerebral deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) plays a<br>
seminal role in the pathogenesis of AD and can precede<br>
cognitive symptoms by years or decades. See, for example,<br>
Selkoe, 1991, Neuron 6:487. Release of A beta from neuronal<br>
cells grown in culture and the presence of A beta in<br>
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both normal individuals and AD<br>
patients has been demonstrated. See, for example, Seubert et<br>
al., 1992, Nature 359:325-327.<br>
It has been proposed that A beta peptide accumulates as a<br>
result of APP processing by beta-secretase, thus inhibition of<br>
this enzyme's activity is desirable for the treatment of AD.<br>
In vivo processing of APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site<br>
is thought to be a rate-limiting step in A beta production,<br>
and is thus a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. See<br>
for example, Sabbagh, M., et al., 1997, Alz. Dis. Rev. 3, 1-<br>
19.<br>
BACE1 knockout mice fail to produce A beta, and present a<br>
normal phenotype. When crossed with transgenic mice that over<br>
express APP, the progeny show reduced amounts of A beta in<br>
brain extracts as compared with control animals (Luo et al.,<br>
2001 Nature Neuroscience 4:231-232). This evidence further<br>
supports the proposal that inhibition of beta-secretase<br>
activity and reduction of A beta in the brain provides a<br>
therapeutic method for the treatment of AD and other beta<br>
amyloid disorders.<br>
At present there are no effective treatments for halting,<br>
preventing, or reversing the progression of Alzheimer's<br>
disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for<br>
pharmaceutical agents capable of slowing the progression of<br>
Alzheimer's disease and/or preventing it in the first place.<br>
Compounds that are effective inhibitors of beta-<br>
secretase, that inhibit beta-secretase-mediated cleavage of<br>
APP, that are effective inhibitors of A beta production,<br>
and/or are effective to reduce amyloid beta deposits or<br>
plaques, are needed for the treatment and prevention of<br>
disease characterised by amyloid beta deposits or plaques,<br>
such as AD.<br>

and preventing Alzheimer's disease. The compounds of the<br>
invention can be prepared by one skilled in the art based only<br>
on knowledge of the compound's chemical structure. The<br>
chemistry for the preparation of the compounds of this<br>
invention is known to those skilled in the art. In fact, there<br>
is more than one process to prepare the compounds of the<br>
invention. Specific examples of methods of preparation can be<br>
found in the art. For examples, see J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63,<br>
4898-4906; J. Org. Chem. 1991, 62, 9348-9353; J. Org. Chem.<br>
1996, 61, 5528-5531; J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 320-330; J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 1145-1155; and references cited therein.<br>
See also U.S. Patent Nos. 6,150,530, 5,892,052, 5,696,270, and<br>
5,362,912, which are incorporated herein by reference, and<br>
references cited therein.<br>
An example of one of many various processes that can be<br>
used to prepare the compounds of the invention is set forth in<br>
Scheme I.<br>
where Rl X, and Z are as defined above or below.<br>
Scheme I illustrates the preparation of compounds wherein<br>
Rc is an isothiochroman 2,2-dioxide using an optionally<br>
substituted benzoic acid as the starting material. One of<br>
skill in the art will recognize that optionally substituted<br>
benzyl halides or benzyl alcohols may also be used as starting<br>
materials.<br>
In Scheme I, the benzoic acid is reduced to a benzyl<br>
alcohol, which is then converted into a benzyl halide.<br>
Alternatively, the benzyl alcohol may be modified to include a<br>
leaving group such as, for example, a tosylate, brosylate,<br>
nosylate, triflate or raesylate. The benzyl compound is then<br>
reacted with a sulfide to generate the thioether. The<br>
carboxylic ester is then hydrolyzed to form a carboxylic acid,<br>
which is then subjected to annulation reaction conditions to<br>
form the desired bicyclic ring system. The annulation can be<br>
carried out using a Lewis acid, polyphosphoric acid, or P205.<br>
Other suitable reagents that effect cyclization are known in<br>
the art.<br>
The resulting bicyclic sulfide is oxidized to form the<br>
sulfone. The keto group is converted into an amine directly<br>
via reductive amination or indirectly through the generation<br>
of an oxime, which is then reduced to form the amine.<br>
Transition metal catalysts and hydrogen or other reducing<br>
agents, such as NaBH4, LiAlH4 or NaCNBH3, may be used to effect<br>
the reduction.<br>
The resulting amine is used to open the epoxide to form<br>
the resulting coupled product. The coupled product is then<br>
deprotected to form a free amine, which is acylated or<br>
sulfonylated to generate the desired final product. In Scheme<br>
I, the use of a Boc protecting group is illustrated, but one<br>
of skill in the art will appreciate that other protecting<br>
groups, such as CBz, benzyl or others can also be used.<br><br>
Scheme II illustrates the introduction of a non-hydrogen<br>
R15 group on the 3-position nitrogen atom in the 1,3-<br>
diaminopropane portion of the molecule. The free nitrogen is<br>
reacted with an electrophile, an aldehyde or ketone and a<br>
reducing agent, an acid chloride, an acid anhydride or an acid<br>
with a coupling agent, such as DCC (dicyclohexyl<br>
carbodiimide), DIC (1,3 diisopropyl carbodiimide), EDCI. (1-<br>
ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride),<br>

dihydro-1-methyl 2F-pyrrolium hexachloroanitimonate), BOMI<br>
(benzotriazol-1-yloxy-N, N-dimethylmethaniminium<br>
hexachloroantimonate), HATU (0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-<br>
1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), HAPyU = 0- (7-<br>
azabenzotriazol-l-yl)- 1,1,3,3-bis(tetramethylene)uronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate, HBTU which is 0-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-<br>
1,1, 3, 3-tetramethyluroniutn hexafluorophosphate, TAPipU which<br>
is 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)- 1,1,3,3-<br>
bis(pentamethylene)uronium etrafluoroborate, AOP (0-(7-<br>

hexafluorophosphate), BDP (benzotriazol-1-yl diethyl<br>
phosphate), BOP (1-<br>
benzotriazolyoxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate), PyAOP (7-<br>

hexafluorophosphate), PyBOP (1-<br>
benzotriazolyoxytris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate), TDBTU (2-(3, 4-dihydro--4-oxo-l,2,3-<br>
benzotriazin-3-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium<br>
tetrafluoroborate), TNTU (2-(5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximido)-<br>
1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate), TPTU (2-(2-oxo-<br>
l(2ff) -pyridyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate),<br>
TSTU (2-succinimido-l,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium<br>
tetrafluoroborate), BEMT (2-bromo-3-ethyl-4-methyl thiazolium<br>
tetrafluoroborate), B0P-C1 (bis(2-oxo-3-<br>
oxazolidinyDphosphinic chloride), BroP<br>
(bromotris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate),<br>
BTFFH (bis(tetramethylenefluoroformamidinium)<br>
hexafluorophosphate), C1P (2-chloro-l,3-<br>
dimethylimidasolidinium hexafluorophosphate), DEPBT (3-<br>
(diethoxyphosphoryloxy)-1,2,3-benzotriasin-4(3H) -one), Dpp-Cl<br>
(diphenylphosphinic chloride), EEDQ (2-ethoxy-l-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-l,2-dihydroquinoline), FDPP (pentafluorophenyl<br>
diphenylphosphinate), HOTT (S-(l-oxido-2-pyridinyl)-1,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethylthiouronium ' hexafluorophosphate), PyBroP<br>
(I.vromotris (pyrrolydino)phophonium hexaf luorophosphate), PyCloP<br>
(chlorotris(pyrrolydino)phophonium hexafluorophosphate), TFFH<br>
(tetramethylfluoroformamidinium hexafluorophosphate), and TOTT<br>
{S-(l-oxido-2-pyridinyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylthiouronium<br>
tetraf luoroborate) to generate the monosubstituttid product,<br>
which can then be deprotected and coupled to the "X-Z" group.<br>
Conversely, the monosubstituted product can be deprotected,<br>
and the free nitrogen reacted with an electrophile, an<br>
aldehyde or ketone and a reducing agent, an acid chloride, an<br>
acid anhydride or an acid with a coupling agent, such as those<br>
previously exemplified to generate the disubstituted product,<br>
which is then coupled to the "X-Z" group.<br>
c <br>
- Scheme III illustrates the introduction of a. tertiary<br>
amine (R is not hydrogen) or a secondary amine (R is hydrogen)<br>
onto the isothiochroman 2,2-dioxide scaffold. First, the<br>
sulfo-ketone is alkylated using, for example, a Grignard<br>
reagent or other alkylating agent, to generate the tertiary<br>
alcohol, which is then converted into a leaving group. One of<br>
skill in the art will appreciate that many possible leaving<br>
groups may be used. Particular examples include, but are not<br>
limited to triflate, mesylate, paratoluene sulfonate,<br>
nosylate, and brosylate. The leaving group is then displaced<br>
using an azide, such as DPPA or NaN3. Substituted azides may<br>
be used in place of the unsubstituted azide. Alternatively,<br>
the desired compounds can be generated from the alcohol<br>
directly without first converting the alcohol into a leaving<br>
group. Such transformations can be readily accomplished using<br>
conventional SN1 conditions according to procedures available<br>
in the literature.<br>
The resulting azide is then reduced to generate the<br>
desired amine. Many reducing agents that will effect the<br>
desired transformation are known. Examples include H2 and Pd,<br>
H2 and Pt, NaBH4, and NaCNBH3. Stronger reducing agents, such<br>
as LiAlH4 and DIBAL may be used, but the sulfone may also be<br>
reduced. If the sulfone is reduced, it may be reoxidized<br>
using methods known in the art, such as MCPBA.<br>
c <br>
As shown in scheme IV, spirocycles may be- generated by<br>
alkylating a compound in the presence of a strong base.<br>
Examples of strong bases include, LDA, KHMDS, and tertiary-<br>
butyl lithium. One of skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
many other bases are strong enough to deprotonate the starting<br>
material and effect the desired transformation.<br>
The alkylating agent dictates the size the of the<br>
spirocycle that is formed. Dibromo ethane, diiodoethane, or<br>
bromo iodoethane will generate a spirocyclopropyl compound,<br>
wherein n is 1. However, longer alkyl chains generate larger<br>
spirocycloalkyl compounds. For example, a 1,5-dihalopentane<br>
generates a spirocyclohexyl compound, wherein n is 4.<br>
Although dihalo compounds are illustrated, one of skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that other leaving groups, such as, for<br>
example, mesylate, tosylate, triflate, brosylate, and nosylate<br>
may be used. The leaving groups may, but need not, be<br>
identical.<br>
Scheme V illustrates the preparation of fluorene<br>
derivatives using optionally substituted salicylic esters as<br>
starting materials. Non-commercially available substituted<br>
salicylic esters may be obtained by a variety of methods well<br>
known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Such<br>
methods include, but are not limited to, halogenations (Rozen<br>
and Lerman (J. Org. Chem. 1993, 239 - 240)], Suzuki couplings<br>
[Miyaura and Suzuki (Chem. Rev. 1995, 2457 - 2483)],<br>

Coupling Reactions, 1998, Wiley-VCH publishers)], Negishi<br>
couplings [Zhu, et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1991, 1445 - 1453)],<br>
Stille cross-couplings [Littke et al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.<br>
1999, 2411 - 2413)], Heck couplings [Whitcombe et al.<br>
(Tetrahedron 2001, 7449 - 7476)], aminations [Wolfe et al. (J.<br>
Org. Chem. 2000, 1144 - 1157)], oxygenations [Fu and Littke<br>
(Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 4177 - 4211)] and carbonylations<br>
[Cai et al. (J Chem Soc, Perkin Trans 1 1997, 2273 - 2274)].<br>
One of skill in the art will recognize that optionally<br>
substituted ortho halo benzoates may also be used as starting<br>
materials.<br>
Phenols of the general formula (1) are readily converted<br>
into triflates employing a triflating source and a base in an<br>
inert solvent. Triflating sources include, but are not<br>
limited to, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride and N-<br>
phenyltrifluoromethanesulfonimide. Bases include, but are not<br>
limited to, trialkyl amines (preferably diisopropylethylamine<br>

(preferably dimethylformamide), dialkylsulfoxides (preferably<br>
dimethylsulfoxide), aromatic, hydrocarbons (preferably benzene<br>
or toluene) or haloalkanes (preferably dichloromethane).<br>

temperature. The progress of this conversion is monitored by<br>
standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods known to<br>
one skilled in the art of organic synthesis.<br>
Triflates may be treated with an aryl borcnic acid or<br>
aryl boronic acid ester where X is equivalent to B(OH)2 or<br>
B(ORa) (0Rb) (where Ra and Rb are lower alkyl, ie. Ci-Cs, or taken<br>

presence of a metal catalyst with or without a base in an<br>
inert solvent to give birayls. Metal catalysts include, but<br>

available boronic acids or boronic esters may be obtained from<br>
the corresponding optionally substituted aryl halide as<br>
described by Gao, et al. (Tetrahedron 1994, 50, 979 -988).<br>
The progress of the coupling reaction is monitored by standard<br>
chromatographic and spectroscopic methods known to one skilled<br>
in the art of organic synthesis.<br>
Alternately, triflates may be treated with organozinc<br>
reagents as taught by Zhu, et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1991, 1445 -<br>
1453).<br>
One skilled in the art of organic synthesis will<br>
appreciate that the nature of the coupling partners described<br>
above could be reversed and the coupling reaction conducted in<br>
substantially the same manner as described above.<br>

reaction, under a wide variety of conditions known to one<br>
skilled in the art of organic synthesis, to form the desired<br>
tricycle. The cyclization reaction is carried out in the<br>
presence of an acidic reagent. Either Bronsted acids<br>
including, but not limited to, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric<br>
acid, methanesulfonic acid and polyphosphoric acid, or Lewis<br>
acids including, but not limited to, aluminum trichloride,<br>
titanium tetrachloride and tin tetrachloride are useful for<br>

Scheme VI<br>
As described above and below, one aspect of the invention<br>
provides for compounds of formula (11) as shown above. These<br>
compounds may be made by methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art from starting compounds that are also known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The process chemistry is further well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. A suitable process for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (11) is set forth in<br>
Scheme VI above.<br>
Scheme VI illustrates the preparation of the desired<br>
compounds using the readily obtainable 6-iodo-chroman-4-ol (6)<br>
as a starting material (see Synthesis, 1997, 23-25). One<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that there are several<br>
methods for the conversion of the alcohol functionality to the<br>
desired amino compounds of formula (7). In Scheme VI the<br>
alcohol (6) is first activated with methane sulfonyl chloride<br>
and the resulting mesylate displaced with sodium azide NaN3.<br>
Alternative methods for the conversion of an alcohol to an<br>
azide are well known to one skilled in the art. The resulting<br>
azide is subsequently reduced using trimthylphosphine in a<br>
mixture of THF and water. One skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that there are several methods for the reduction of<br>
an azide to the corresponding amine. For examples, see<br>
Larock, R.C. in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Wiley-<br>
VCH Publishers, 1999. This reduction of the aside produces a<br>
mixture of enantiomers of the amine (7). This enantiomeric<br>
mixture can be separated by means known to those skilled in<br>
the art such as low temperature recrystallization of a chiral<br>
salt or by chiral preparative HPLC, most preferably by HPLC,<br>
employing commercially available chiral columns.<br>
The resulting amine (7) is used to open the epoxide (8)<br>
to afford the protected (6-iodo-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-4-<br>
yl)amino propyl carbamate (9). Suitable reaction conditions<br>
for opening the epoxide (8) include running the reaction in a<br>
wide range of common and inert solvents. C1-C6 alcohol solvents<br>
are preferred and isopropyl alcohol most preferred. The<br>
reactions can be run at temperatures ranging from 2 0-25 °C up<br>
to the reflux temperature of the alcohol employed. The<br>
preferred temperature range for conducting the reaction is<br>
between 50°C and the refluxing temperature of the alcohol<br>
employed.<br>
The protected iodo-chromen (9) is deprotected to the<br>
corresponding amine by means known to those skilled in the art<br>
for removal of amine protecting groups. Suitable means for<br>
removal of the amine protecting group depend on the nature of<br>
the protecting group. Those skilled in the art, knowing the<br>
nature of a specific protecting group, know which reagent is<br>
preferable for its removal. For example, it is preferred to<br>
remove the preferred protecting group, BOC, by dissolving the<br>
protected iodo-chroman in a trifluoroacetic acid/<br>
dichloromethane (l/l) mixture. When complete the solvents are<br>
removed under reduced pressure to give the corresponding amine<br>
(as the corresponding salt, i.e. trifluoroacetic acid salt)<br>
which is used without further purification. However, if<br>
desired, the amine can be purified further by means well known<br>
to- those skilled in the art, such as for example<br>
recrystallization. Further, if the non-salt form is desired<br>
that also can be obtained by means known to those skilled in<br>
the art, such as for example, preparing the free base amine<br>
via treatment of the salt with mild basic conditions.<br>
Additional BOC deprotection conditions and deprotection<br>
conditions for other protecting groups can be found in T. W.<br>
Green and P. G. M. Wuts in Protecting Groups in Organic<br>
Chemistry, 3rd edition, John xWiley and Sons, 1999.<br>
The amine is then reacted with an appropriately<br>
substituted amide forming agent Z-(CO)-Y to produce coupled<br>
amides (10) by nitrogen acylation means known to those skilled<br>
in the art. Nitrogen acylation conditions for the reaction of<br>
amine with an amide forming agent Z-(CO)-Y are known to those<br>
skilled in the art and can be found in R.C. Larock in<br>
Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, 1989,<br>
p. 981, 979, and 972. Y comprises -OH (carboxylic acid) or<br>
halide (acyl halide), preferably chlorine, imidazole (acyl<br>
imidazole), or a suitable group to produce a mixed anhydride.<br>
The acylated iodo-chromen (10) is coupled with an<br>
appropriately functionalzed organometallic R200M to afford<br>
compounds of formula (11) using conditions known to those<br>
skilled in the art. One skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that there are several methods for coupling various alkyl and<br>
aryl groups to an aromatic iodide. For examples, see L. S.<br>
Hegedus Transition Metals in the Synthesis of Complex Organic<br>
Molecules, University Science, 1999.<br>
bcneme VII sees forth alternative routes to to 4<br>
aminochromanes, which are useful for preparing compounds of<br>
formula (11). Amines of formula (16) can be prepared by<br>
coupling the appropriately functionalized organometallic to 6-<br>
iodo-chroman-4-ol (12) or to the appropriately protected iodo-<br>
amino chroman of the formula (14). Further elaboration of the<br>
coupled products using methods known to one of skill in the<br>
art, ultimately yields the desired amines of formula (16).<br>
The chemistry from this point forward follows the<br>
generalizations described in Scheme VIII for converting<br>
compound 9 to 10.<br>
Scheme VIII illustrates another general preparation of<br>
amines of formula (9) that upon following the generalizations<br>
outlined in Schemes VI and VII will result in compounds of the<br>
formula (10). From this point forward, the chemistry is<br>
essentially the same as described for Schemes VI and VII.<br>
Scheme IX<br>
Scheme IX illustrates the synthesis of various 5H-<br>
thiopyranopyrimidinones from a variety of starting materials.<br>
Suitable reaction conditions are described in, for example, J.<br>
Heterocycl. Chem., 21(5), 1437-40; 1984.<br>
One of ordinary skill will appreciate that treating the<br>
sulfide with an oxidizing agent, such as parachlorobenzoic<br>
acid (MCPBA) or oxone, generates the sulfoxide or the sulfone.<br>
The oxidation of the sulfide can be done sequentially, i.e.,<br>
generating and isolating the sulfoxide and then oxidizing it<br>
to the sulfone, or the sulfone can be generated directly from<br>
the sulfide. Further manipulations of the ketone are<br>
described in the application.<br>
It is also understood that the pyrimidyl ring can be<br>
further substituted by means known in the art. For example,<br>
the pyridyl ring can be alkylated, halogenated, acylated,<br>
and/or nitrated. See Organic Transformations by Richard C.<br>

Scheme XV<br>
The compounds of the invention that comprise<br>
tetrahydroquinoline moieties can be made by methods known in<br>
the art. The following general scheme can also be useful for<br>
tetrahydroquiniline compound synthesis.<br><br>
Description of general synthetic scheme<br>
Aniline TQ-1 is alkylated with a halide TQ-2B or acrylate<br>
TQ-2A to give TQ-3. TQ-3 is then treated with a strong acid<br>
or with a Lewis acid at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 140<br>
°C, preferably with phosphorus pentoxide and methanesulfonic<br>
acid at 130 °C, to give ketone TQ-4. The nitrogen of TQ-4 is<br>
then either protected with a protecting group, many of which<br>
are listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene<br>
and Wuts, 3rd edition, 1999, Wiley-Interscience, or is<br>
substituted with an alkyl group, an acyl group, or a sulfonyl<br>
group, using methods well known to those versed in the art,<br>
using R-Z, to give protected ketone TQ-5. An alternative<br>
preparation of TQ-5 starts with TQ-4 where R' is hydrogen.<br>
Halogenation with halogenating reagents such as N-<br>
bromosuccinimide, N-iodosuccinirnide, dibromatin, and the like<br>
gives TQ-4a where R' is preferably bromine or iodine.<br>
Treatment of TQ-4a under cross coupling conditions such as<br>
those described by Negishi (Tet. Lett. 1983, 3823), Huo (Org.<br>
Lett. 2 003, 423) and reviewed by Knochel (Tetrahedron 1998,<br>
8275) provides TQ-4b where R' is alkyl. Further treatment of<br>
TQ-4b with R-Z as described above gives TQ-5.<br>
Protected ketone TQ-5 is then converted to amine TQ-7 by<br>
several methods, the choice of which may depend on the nature<br>
of the R group. In the first method, TQ-5 is treated with a<br>
hydroxyl amine in the presence of a base and a catalytic<br>
amount of acid in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, butanol,<br>
and the like, at temperatures ranging from room temperature to<br>
the reflux temperature of the solvent, to give oxime TQ-6.<br>
TQ-6 is then reduced to amine TQ-7 using a suitable catalyst,<br>
preferably palladium, in solvents such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
or ethyl acetate, under a blanket of hydrogen at pressures<br>
ranging from atmospheric to 100 pounds per square inch.<br>
Alternatively, protected ketone TQ-5 is reduced to alcohol TQ-<br>
8 using reducing agents known to those well versed in the art,<br>
preferably and depending on the nature of group R using sodium<br>
borohydride in methanol or ethanol at temperatures ranging<br>
from 0 to 100 °C. Alcohol TQ-8 is then converted to sulfonate<br>
ester TQ-9 with reagents such as methanesulfonyl chloride or<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride using methods known to those well-<br>
versed in the art. Displacement of the sulfonate ester with<br>
azide using, for example, sodium azide in solvents such as<br>
dichlorome thane and DMF at temperatures ranging from room<br>
temperature to 120 °C, gives azide TQ-10. Azide TQ-10 is then<br>
reduced to amine T-7 using, for example, trimethylphosphine in<br>
solvents such as THF and the like at temperatures between 0 °C<br>
to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Other methods of<br>
reduction of the azide group are known; the choice of reducing<br>
agent will depend on the nature of the R and R' groups and<br>
will be known to those well versed in the art and can be found<br>
in references such as Smith and March, March's Advanced<br>
Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 5th<br>
ed., 2001, Wiley-Interscience. Amine TQ-7 is then stirred in<br>
the presence of epoxide TQ-11 in preferably, but not limited<br>
to, alcoholic solvents such as ethanol, isopropropyl, tert-<br>
butyl, or n-butyl alcohol, at temperatures ranging from 50 °C<br>
to the reflux temperature of the solvent, to give Boc-amine<br>
TQ-12. Boc-amine TQ-12 is then treated with strong acid such<br>
as trifluoroacetic acid in non-reactive solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane or with dry HC1 in solvents such as dialkyl<br>
ethers or alcoholic solvents at temperatures ranging from room<br>
temperature to 8 0 °C to give/ after washing with base, triamine<br>
TQ-13. Triamine TQ-13 is acylated by means well-known to<br>
those versed in the art, for example condensation with a<br>
carboxylic acid using coupling agents such as EDC, DCC, HATU,<br>
or HBTU and the like. Preferred methods are acylation with<br>
acyl imidazole or acetylation with N, N-diacetylmethoxyamine<br>
to give TQ-14.<br>
7-bromo-l-tetralone was prepared according to the<br>
procedure described in Cornelius, L. A.M.; Combs, D. W.<br>
Synthetic Communications 1994, 24, 2777-2788. The above<br>
isomers were separated using silica gel flash chromatography<br>
(Biotage Flash 75, elution solvent 20/1 hexanes:MTBE) to yield<br>
5-bromo-l-tetralone (11.59 g, 51%) and 7-bromo-l-tetralone<br>
(9.45 g, 42%).<br>
Tetralin-1-ol compounds may be prepared as shown in<br>
Example 2 below. Mores specifically, (R)-7-ethyltetralin-l-ol<br>
was prepared in three steps starting from 7-ethyl-l-tetralone.<br>
The first step involves an asymmetric reduction of the ketone<br>
using borane and Corey's oxazaboralidine chiral auxilliary.<br>
This reduction produced a 97:3 mixture of (presumably) R/S<br>
enantiomers. A Mitsunobu-like Sn2 conversion to the azide and<br>
LiAlH4 reduction to the amine produced material 98:2 S/R.<br>

Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 763-769. More particularly, 7-ethyl-l-<br>
tetralone (2.29 g, 13.1 mmol) was placed in a 100 mL round<br>
bottomed flask and dissolved in anhydrous THF (40 mL).<br>
Activated 4a molecular sieves were added and the mixture was<br>
aged for 2 h before transferring via cannula to a 250 ml<br>
three-necked round bottom flask fitted with a dropping funnel,<br>
thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet. The solution was cooled to<br>
-25 °C and 1M (S)-tetrahydro-1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-lH,3H-<br>
pyrollo[1,2-c][1,3,2]oxazaborole in toluene (1.3 mL, 1.3 mmol)<br>
was added. The source of the oxazoborole was Aldrich, cat.<br>
no. 45,770-1, n(S)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine". Use of the<br>
S-auxilliary will produce R-alcohols. In accordance with the<br>
forging references, the use of 5 mol% oxazaborolidine catalyst<br>
should give comparable results.<br>
The dropping funnel was charged with a solution of<br>
borane-methylsulfide (0.70 g, 0.87 tnL, 9.3 mmol) in anhydrous<br>
THF (15 mL, dried over 4A sieves). The borane solution was<br>
added dropwise over 2 0 min keeping the reaction temperature<br>
less than -20 °C. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at -15 to -<br>
2 0 °C whereupon TLC analysis indicated consumption of the<br>
ketone. The reaction was quenched by careful addition of<br>
methanol (15 mL) at -2 0 °C and allowed to warm to ambient<br>
temperature and stir for 16 h. The volatiles were removed in<br>
vacuo and the residue was purified by silica gel<br>
chromatography (Biotage Flash 65, elution solvent 6/1<br>
hexanes:ethyl acetate) to yield (R)-7-ethyltetralin-l-ol (1.82<br>
g, 79%). Analytical chiral HPLC indicated a 96.6/3.4 mixture<br>
of enantiomers (Chirocel OD-H column, isocratic elution 2:98<br>
IPA/hexane, 0.9 mL/min, RT 15.2 min (minor enantiomer), 17.5<br>
min (major enantiomer).<br><br>

Dautzenberg, F. M. J. Med. Chew. 2000, 43, 1329-1338. The<br>
authors therein report a somewhat diminished yield due to<br>
partial formation of a dihydronapthalene via elimination of<br>
the hydroxyl moiety.<br>
More specifically, a solution of (R)-7-ethyltetralin-l-ol<br>
(1.77 g, 10.1 mmol) in toluene (25 mL) was cooled in an ice<br>
bath and treated with diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA, 3.3 g,<br>
2.7 mL, 12 mmol). A solution of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-<br>
7-ene (DBU, 1.8 g, 1.8 mL, 12 mmol) in toluene (8 mL) was<br>
added over 2 0 min and the mixture was allowed to stir at 0 °C<br>
for 2 h and ambient temp for 16 h. The mixture was filtered<br>
through a pad of silica gel (eluted 6:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate)<br>
to remove precipitates and the volatiles were removed in vacuo<br>
to give an oily residue of the crude S-azide. This material<br>

The azide was dissolved in dry THF (2 0 mL) and added<br>
dropwise at RT to a slurry of lithium aluminum hydride (0.459<br>
g, 12 mmol) in dry THF (2 0 mL). The mixture was stirred at RT<br>
for Ih and then heated to reflux for 1 h. The reaction was<br>
cooled to RT and quenched by successive addition of water<br>
(0.45 mL), 15% aq NaOH (0.45 mL) and water (1.4 mL). The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h and then filtered<br>
through a pad of Celite (eluted diethyl ether). The volatiles<br>
were removed in vacuo and the residue taken up into ethyl<br>
acetate (40 mL) and treated with 4N HC1 in dioxane (3 mL).<br>
The resulting precipitate was filtered (wash ethyl acetate),<br>
collected and vacuum dried to give (S)-7-ethyl-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-1-napthylamine hydrochloride as a white solid (1.09<br>
g, 51%). Analytical chiral HPLC indicated a 96:4 mixture of<br>
enantiomers (Daicel Crownpak (-) column, isocratic elution 10%<br>
methanol in water (0.1% TFA), 0.8 mL/min, RT 56.2 min (minor<br>
enantiomer), 78.2 min (major enantiomer).<br>
Scheme VIII below depicts formation of a tetralinol,<br>
prepared in three steps starting from 7-bromo-l-tetralone.<br>
The first step involves an asymmetric reduction of the ketone<br>
using borane and Corey's oxazaboralidine chiral auxilliary.<br>
This reduction produced a 98:2 mixture of (presumably) R/S<br>
enantiomers. A Mitsunobu-like Sn2 conversion to the azide and<br>
LiA.u. reduction to the amine produced material 96:4 S/R.<br>
The reduction is performed using the general procedure<br>
described in example 2. Analytical chiral HPLC of the product<br>
indicated a 98:2 mixture of enantiomers (Chirocel OD-H column,<br>
isocratic elution 2:98 IPA/hexane, 0.9 mL/min, RT 18.4 min<br>
(minor enantiomer), 19.5 min (major enantiomer). Proton NMR<br>

dibromoethane. This mixture is placed in a water bath at 5 0 °C<br>
and 3-isopropylbromobenzene (5.0 g, 25 mmol) in 15 mL of dry<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added dropwise over 20 min, while the<br>
bath temperature is raised to 70 °C. The mixture is stirred and<br>
refluxed for 4 0 additional min. The solution is cooled in an<br>
ice-water bath and cyclohexanone (2.0 mL, 19 mmol) in 10 mL of<br>
dry THF is added dropwise over 15 min. The ice bath is removed<br>
and the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over<br>
lh. The solution is decanted into aqueous saturated NH4Cl, and<br>
combined with an ether wash of the residual magnesium<br>
turnings. The organic phase is washed twice more with aqueous<br>
NH4C1, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated.<br>

Compound 3 (2.1 g, 8.3 mmol) is shaken with aqueous 1 N<br>
NaOH and ethyl acetate. The layers are separated and the<br>
organic phase is washed sequentially with aqueous NaOH and<br>
then with 1N NaHCO3. The organic layer is then dried over<br>
Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford a quantitative<br>
yield (1.8 g) of the free amine as an oil. Example 134 (4, 1.5<br>

Step 1. Preparation of formyl imidazole 40.<br>
To a solution of formic acid (0.76 mL, 20 mmol, 96%) in<br>
CH2C12 stirring under nitrogen is added, portionwise over 10<br>
min, 3.6 g (22 mmol) of carbonyldiimidazole, and the mixture<br>
is allowed to stir overnight. Anhydrous MgSO4 is added, and<br>
after several hours the mixture is filtered and concentrated<br>
in vacuo (note: formyl imidazole is volatile and this<br>
operation should be carefully monitored for maximum recovery)<br>
to afford 0.7 g of iridescent crystals. The NMR spectrum<br>

To a solution of amine 6 (209 mg, 0.43 mmol) in 4 mL of<br>
CH2C12 under nitrogen is added 125]µL (0.9 mmol) of<br>
triethylamine. To this mixture is added 75 mg of the solid<br>
from Step 1, which is determined by NMR to contain 63% by<br>
weight of formyl imidazole (47 mg, 0.49 mmol) and the solution<br>
is stirred for 20 min. Methanol (5 mL is added, followed by 2<br>

fluoroacetamide hydrochloride 43<br>
Step 1. Preparation of fluoroacetyl imidazole 42.<br>
To a slurry of 1.2 g (12 mmol) of sodium fluoroacetate in<br>
25 mL of CH2Cl2 is added, with swirling of the flask, 1 mL (12<br>
mmol) of concentrated HCl (note: this operation must be<br>
carried out in an efficient hood; fluoroacetic acid is highly,<br>
toxic!). About 1 teaspoonful of anhydrous MgSO4 is added to the<br>
flask, and the contents are filtered, rinsing the filter paper<br>
with 15 mL of CH2C12. The combined filtrate and wash are placed<br>
under nitrogen, and 1.3 g (8 mmol) of carbonyldiimidazole is<br>
added portionwise to the stirring mixture over 20 min. NMR<br>
analysis of an aliquot removed 40 min later indicates nearly<br>
complete reaction. After 1 h a teaspoonful of MgSO4 is added,<br>
and the mixture is allowed to stir overnight. It is filtered<br>
and concentrated to remove most of the CH2C12, leaving 1.6 g of<br>
a pale yellow oil. The NMR spectrum indicates the presence of<br>
CH2C12, fluoroacetic acid, imidazole, and fluoroacetyl<br>
imidazole 42 : 1H NMR (CDCl3) d 8.26 (s, 1 H), 7.53 (s, 1 H),<br>

To amine 6 (0.64 mmol) is added 1 N NaOH and ethyl<br>
acetate. The organic phase is washed with more 1N NaOH, brine,<br>
and then dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to 265 mg of a<br>
colorless oil. This free base is dissolved in 3 mL of CH2C12<br>
under nitrogen and 3.2 mL ( 0.64 mmol) of a 0.2 M solution of<br>
fluoroacetyl imidazole 42 in CH2C12 is added. The mixture is<br>

Phthaloyldichloride (3.6 mL, 25 mmol) is added slowly over 10<br>
min via syringe while the mixture is stirred. The mixture<br>
becomes a clear orange solution transiently, eventually<br>
depositing a precipitate. After stirring for 40 h, the mixture<br>
is concentrated in vacuo (in the hood!). The oily coral solid<br>
is triturated with hexanes. Within minutes the hexanes mother<br>
liquor drops a precipitate, which is filtered off to afford<br>
0.2 g of a light coral solid: 1H NMR (CDC13) d 7.99 (m, 2 H),<br>

EXAMPLE 106<br><br>
Step 1. Epoxide opening with 1-(3.-bromophenyl)<br>
cyclopropyl amine.<br><br>
N-BOC-1-(3-bromophenyl)aminocyclopropane (15.60g, 50.2<br>
mmol) was treated with 4N HCl in dioxane (50 mL) and stirred<br>
for 2 h. The volatiles were evaporated in vacuo and the<br>
residue taken up into 1N NaOH (250 mL). The mixture was<br>
extracted with diethyl ether (2 X 200 mL). The combined ether<br>
extracts were washed with brine (50 mL), dried (sodium<br>
sulfate), then filtered and evaporated in vacuo to provide the<br>
amine free base.<br>
The amine free base was dissolved in 2-propanol (250 mL)<br>
and the epoxide (15.0g, 50.2 mmol) was added. The mixture was<br>
heated to reflux for 22 h and allowed to stand at ambient<br>
temperature for 3 d. Analysis by HPLC indicated that the<br>
desired product predominated, and that some starting<br>
cyclopropylamine remained unreacted. The starting epoxide was<br>
consumed. The volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue<br>
was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (eluted 2:1<br>
hexane/ethyl acetate) to provide the final product (13.68 g,<br>
53%).<br>

Amine.<br><br>
The Boc-protected amine (13.5 g, 26.7 mrnol) was treated<br>
with 4N HC1 in dioxane (30 mL). Methanol (15 mL) was added<br>
and the mixture became homogeneous before depositing a<br>
precipitate. The mixture was stirred for 3 h before the<br>
volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was taken up in<br>
1N NaOH (150 mL) and the mixture was extracted with diethyl<br>
ether (3 X 100 mL). The combined ether extracts were washed<br>
with brine (50 mL), dried (magnesium sulfate), filtered and<br>
evaporated in vacuo to give the desired amine (6.5g), which<br>
was used directly in the next step.<br>

The compound (1), which is readily available, was<br>
protected and then underwent palladium-mediated coupling with<br>
neo-pentylzinc chloride (generated in situ) to give neo-pentyl<br>

intermediate amine 2b as its hydrochloride salt, which was<br>
utilized in the construction of additional targets (infra).<br>

addition with acrylonitrile to give nitrile H141. Subsequent<br>
acid hydrolysis gave carboxylic acid H142, which was then<br>
converted to the acid chloride and cyclized intramolecularly<br>
to give chromonone. H143..Alpha bromination of ketone H143<br>
gave bromide H144, which was reduced with sodium borohydride<br>
to give bromo alcohol H145. Using Ritters reaction<br>
conditions, H145 was transformed to racemic amino alcohol 29.<br>

reduced pressure. The acid chloride thus obtained was used<br>
without further purification in the next reaction.<br>
Aluminum chloride (1.10 g, 8.24 mmol, 2 equiv) was added<br>
in one portion to a solution of acid chloride as above in dry<br>
methylene chloride (50 mL) and the resulting brown mixture was<br>

quenched with the addition of 1 M hydrochloric acid (4 mL) and<br>
most of ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation. The<br>
residue was partitioned between water and methylene chloride.<br>
The aqueous layer was further extracted with methylene<br>
chloride. The combined organics were dried (sodium sulfate)<br>

EXAMPLE 114<br>
A. Synthesis of Neo-Pentylmagnesium Bromide<br>
A 3-necked, round-bottom flask fitted with an addition<br>
funnel, water condenser and magnetic stir bar was charged with<br>
magnesium turnings (10.0 g, 413.8 mmol), iodine (100 mg), and<br>
glass shards and then heated vigorously under vacuum with<br>
stirring for 2 0 min. The reaction flask was cooled to room<br>
temperature and then charged with argon and the magnesium<br>
turnings stirred for an additional 0.5 h. The flask was then<br>
charged with diethyl ether (65 mL) and the addition funnel<br>
charged with a solution of neo-pentyl bromide (20.0 g, 132.4<br>
mmol) in diethyl ether (100 mL). Neat rzeo-pentyl bromide<br>
(2.5 g, 16.55 mmol) was added directly to the reaction mixture<br>
and the solution was gently warmed with a heat gun to initiate<br>
the reaction. Once the reaction was initiated, the contents<br>
of the addition funnel were added dropwise over the course of<br>
1 h to maintain, a gentle reflux. Another aliquot of neat neo-<br>
pentyl bromide (2.5 g, 16.55 mmol) was then added to the<br>
reaction mixture in one portion followed by dropwise addition<br>
of 1,2-dibromoethane (14.3 mL, 165.5 mmol) over the course of<br>
1 h. Ethane gas generated was swept from the reaction flask<br>
by a steady stream of nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then<br>
heated at reflux for 24 h and cooled to room temperature to<br>
yield a black solution. The suspended solid was allowed to<br>
settle and the solution above the solid residue was neo-<br>
pentylmagnesium bromide (ca. 1.0 M in ether, 165.5 mmol),<br>

for 36 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and<br>
the residue partitioned between ethyl acetate and saturated<br>
sodium bicarbonate. The phases were separated and the organic<br>
phase was washed with water, saturated sodium chloride, dried<br>

mixture of dichloromethane and dimethylformamide (200 mL) was<br>
added HATU (25g, 65.8 mmol), and the solution s.tirred 2 min.<br>
Excess ammonium chloride (20 g) was added, and the<br>
heterogeneous mixture was stirred 1 h. Ammonium hydroxide (20<br>
mL) was added causing a white precipitate. The precipitate<br>
was filtered and washed with ethyl acetate. The solution was<br>
diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water, 1 N<br>
hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium bicarbonate, and saturated<br>
sodium chloride, dried (magnesium sulfate), filtered, and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure resulting in the formation<br>

3-Bromobenzylnitrile was obtained from Kimera. Powder<br>
KOH was obtained from Oxechem. Other reagents were from<br>
Aldrich.<br>
Step 1: 1- (3-bromoph.enyl) cyclohexanecarbonitrile<br>
To a 5 L 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with N2 inlet,<br>
temperature probe, addition funnel, and mechanical stirrer was<br>
added 3-bromobenzylnitrile (297 g, 1.51 mol, 1.0 eq) and THF<br>
(2.75 L). The clear solution was cooled to 0-5° C via ice<br>
bath. KOtBu (3 74 g, 3.3 3 mol, 2.2 eq) was weighed out inside<br>
the glove box into a 200 mL round bottom flask and added to<br>
the cold clear solution in shots. The first shot (71.1 g) was<br>
added over 30 seconds and an immediate exotherm of 9° C was<br>
observed along with color change from clear to orange/brown<br>
solution. After waiting for 15 min for the solution to cool<br>
back down to 5.1° C, the second shot (96.0 g) was added and an<br>
exotherm of 6.5° C was observed. After another 15 min, the<br>
third shot (100.4 g) was added and an exotherm of 5° C was<br>
observed. After another 15 min, the fourth and final shot<br>
(106.5 g) was added and an exotherm of 3.8° C was observed.<br>
The orange/brown solution was stirred in ice bath for 30 min<br>
upon which the solution thickened. Carefully add 1,5-<br>
dibromopentane (365.5 g, 1.56 mol, 1.05 eq) to orange/brown<br>
mixture at such a rate to maintaining reaction temperature<br>
slurry and the exotherm will continue to climb during<br>
addition. The addition took ca 2 hours. The addition funnel<br>
was rinsed with THF (250 mL) and added to the brown slurry.<br>
The ice bath was then removed and the slurry self-warmed to RT<br>
while maintaining medium agitation. Sample of the slurry was<br>
pulled after 1 hour of stirring. GC indicated completion with<br>
only excess 1,5-dibromopentane and product. The light brown<br>
slurry was then filtered over a pad of celite to remove salts.<br>
The cake was rinsed with THF (ca 2 L) until clear. Ice (ca 1<br>
L in volume) was then added to the burgundy filtrate and<br>
stirred at RT overnight. The mixture was then concentrated to<br>
remove THF and the resultant biphasic brown mixture was<br>
extracted with EtOAc and saturated NaCl solution. The orange<br>
organic layers were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and<br>
rinsed with EtOAc. The orange filtrate was then concentrated<br>
to dryness to give red oil. EtOAc (100 mL) was added to<br>
redissolve oil. While stirring at medium speed, heptane (2 L)<br>
was added over 1-2 min upon which burgundy oil sticks to<br>
bottom and sides of flask. The yellow solution was then<br>
carefully decanted away from the sticky oil and concentrated<br>
to dryness to give light orange oil (379.7 g, 95% yield). GC<br>
of light orange oil indicated excess 1,5-dibromopentane (2.8<br>
area%), product (95.3 area%), and 7 other peaks having less<br>
than 0.5 area% (total =1.9 area%).<br>

The product from step 2, above (189 g, 603 mmol) was<br>
suspended in warmed t-BuOH (1140 mL) at -35°C, 3N NaOH (570 mL,<br>
2.8 equiv) was added. The reaction cooled to 30°C. NaOCl (380<br>
mL, 13.6wt%, 1.4 equiv.) was added in one portion. The<br>
reaction mixture was cooled to 26°C, and then started to warm<br>
up. Ice was directly added to the mixture to controlled the<br>
temperature 
generation stopped after 15 min. All solids dissolved at that<br>
point. Assayed organic layer at 30 min, GC indicated<br>
completion. The mixture was extracted with 1100 mL of MTBE.<br>
The organic layer was combined with the organic layer of a<br>
parallel run of the same scale, and filtered to remove some<br>
white ppt (likely urea side product). The aqueous layers were<br>
extracted with 300 mL of MTBE. The combined MTBE layers (ca.<br>
5 L) was treated with 150 mL of cone. HCl (1.8 mol), stirred<br>
for 4h, cooled to 0°C and filtered. The white solid was dried<br>
at 50°C to give 1st crop 180 g (52%) of material. The filtrate<br>
was treated with NaOH and NaHSO3 to pH&gt;12. The organic layer<br>
was concentrated to an oil. This oil was dissolved in 1 L of<br>

61.7 g the epoxide (206 mmol, 1 eq., FW 299.3) and the<br>
above free base were suspended in 320 ml t-BuOH (warm). A<br>
mantle and thermo/probe was used to heat the stirring mixture<br>
to 80°C at 5°C/hour ramp overnight. The mixture was<br>
concentrated on rotovap with 20°C condenser. The resulting oil<br>
was dissolved in MTBE (1L), washed with 1N HC1 (200ml, then<br>
100 mL x 5) (contain the product from step 3, the first wash<br>
was quickly separated to avoid crash out). Aqueous layer was<br>
sequentially back-extracted with MTBE (200 mL). The MTBE<br>

is no longer needed, it is removed by methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art. By definition the amino protecting group<br>
must be readily removable. A variety of suitable<br>
methodologies are known to those skilled in the art; see also<br>

more preferred that the protecting group be t-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize suitable methods of<br>
introducing a t-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl protecting<br>
group and may additionally consult T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts<br>

The compounds of the invention may contain geometric or<br>
optical isomers as tautomers. Thus, the invention includes<br>
all tautomers and pure geometric isomers, such as the E and Z<br>
geometric isomers, as mixtures thereof. Further, the<br>
invention includes pure enantiomers, diastereomers and/or<br>
mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures. The individual<br>
geometric isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers may be<br>
prepared or isolated by methods known to those in the art,<br>
including but not limited to chiral chromatography; preparing<br>
diastereomers, separating the diastereomers and then<br>
converting the diastereomers into enantiomers.<br>

All compound names were generated using ACD Namepro<br>
version 5.09, Chemdraw v. 6.02, or were derived therefrom.<br>
Several of the compounds of formula (I) are amines, and<br>
as such form salts when reacted with acids. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts are preferred over the corresponding amines<br>
since they produce compounds which are more water soluble,<br>
stable and/or more crystalline. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts are any salt which retains the activity of the parent<br>
compound and does not impart any deleterious or undesirable<br>
effect on the subject to whom it is administered and in the<br>
context in which it. is administered. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include salts of both inorganic and organic<br>
acids. The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include salts of the following acids acetic, aspartic,<br>
benzenesulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, bisulfuric, bitartaric,<br>

The invention provides compounds, compositions, kits, and<br>
methods for inhibiting beta-secretase enzyme activity and A<br>
beta peptide production. Inhibition of beta-secretase enzyme<br>
activity halts or reduces the production of A beta from APP<br>
and reduces or eliminates the formation of beta-amyloid<br>
deposits in the brain.<br>
Methods of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the invention, and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, are useful for treating humans or<br>
animals suffering from a condition characterized by a<br>
pathological form of beta-amyloid peptide, such as beta-<br>
amyloid plaques, and for helping to prevent or delay the onset<br>
of such a condition. For example, the compounds are useful<br>
for treating Alzheimer's disease, for helping prevent or delay<br>
the onset of Alzheimer's disease, for treating patients with<br>
MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and preventing or delaying the<br>
onset of Alzheimer's disease in those who would progress from<br>
MCI to AD, for treating Down's syndrome, for treating humans<br>
who have Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of<br>
the Dutch-Type, for treating cerebral amyloid angiopathy and<br>
preventing its potential consequences, i.e. single and<br>
recurrent lobal hemorrhages, for treating other degenerative<br>
dementias, including dementias of mixed vascular and<br>
degenerative origin, dementia associated with Parkinson's<br>
disease, dementia associated with progressive supranuclear<br>
palsy, dementia associated with cortical basal degeneration,<br>
and diffuse Lewy body type Alzheimer's disease. The compounds<br>
and compositions of the invention are particularly useful for<br>
treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease. When treating or<br>
preventing these diseases, the compounds of the invention can<br>
either be used individually or in combination, as is best for<br>
the patient.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating" means that the<br>
compounds of the invention can be used in humans with at least<br>
a tentative diagnosis of disease. The compounds of the<br>
invention will delay or slow the progression of the disease<br>
thereby giving the individual a more useful life span.<br>
The term "preventing" means that the compounds of the<br>
invention are useful when administered to a patient who has<br>
not been diagnosed as possibly having the disease at the time<br>
of administration, but who would normally be expected to<br>
develop the disease or be at increased risk for the disease.<br>
The compounds of the invention will slow the development of<br>
disease symptoms, delay the onset of the disease, or prevent<br>
the individual from developing the disease at all. Preventing<br>
also includes administration of the compounds of the invention<br>
to those individuals, thought to be predisposed to the disease<br>
due to age, familial history, genetic or chromosomal<br>
abnormalities, and/or due to the presence of one or more<br>
biological markers for the disease, such as a known genetic<br>
mutation of APP or APP cleavage products in brain tissues or<br>
fluids.<br>
In treating or preventing the above diseases, the<br>
compounds of the invention - are administered in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount. The therapeutically<br>
effective amount will vary depending on the particular<br>
compound used and the route of administration, as is known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
In treating a patient displaying any of the diagnosed<br>
above conditions a physician may administer a compound of the<br>
invention immediately and continue administration<br>
indefinitely, as needed. In treating patients who are not<br>
diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease, but who are believed<br>
to be at substantial risk for Alzheimer's disease, the<br>
physician should preferably start treatment when the patient<br>
first experiences early pre-Alzheimer's symptoms such as,<br>
memory or cognitive problems associated with aging. In<br>
addition, there are some patients who may be determined to be<br>
at risk for developing Alzheimer's through the detection of a<br>
genetic marker such as AP0E4 or other biological indicators<br>
that are predictive for Alzheimer's disease. In these<br>
situations, even though the patient does not have symptoms of<br>
the disease, administration of the compounds of the invention<br>
may be started before symptoms appear, and treatment may be<br>
continued indefinitely to prevent or delay the onset of the<br>
disease.<br>
Dosage Forms and Amounts<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
orally, parenterally, (IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo SQ),<br>
sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally,<br>
topically, or rectally. Dosage forms known to those of skill<br>
in the art are suitable for delivery of the compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
Compositions are provided that contain therapeutically<br>
effective amounts of the compounds of the invention. The<br>
compounds are preferably formulated into suitable<br>
pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets, capsules, or<br>
elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or<br>
suspensions for parenteral administration. Typically the<br>
compounds described above are formulated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the<br>
art.<br>
About.1 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds<br>
of the invention or a physiologically acceptable salt is<br>
compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier,<br>
excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in<br>
a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical<br>
practice. The amount of active substance. in those<br>
compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in<br>
the range indicated is obtained. The compositions are<br>
preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage<br>
containing from about 2 to about 100 mg, more preferably about<br>
10 to about 30 mg of the active ingredient. The term "unit<br>
dosage from" refers to physically discrete units suitable as<br>
unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each<br>
unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material<br>
calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in<br>
association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
To prepare compositions, one or more compounds of the<br>
invention are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. Upon mixing or addition of the<br>
compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution,<br>
suspension, emulsion, or the like. Liposomal suspensions may<br>
also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
These may be prepared according to methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The form of the resulting mixture depends<br>
upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of<br>
administration and the solubility of the compound in the<br>
selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is<br>
sufficient for lessening or ameliorating at least one symptom<br>
of the disease, disorder., or condition treated and may be<br>
empirically determined.<br>
Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for<br>
administration of the compounds provided herein include any-<br>
such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable<br>
for the particular mode of administration. In addition, the<br>
active materials can also be mixed with other active materials<br>
that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that<br>
supplement the desired action, or have another action. The<br>
compounds may be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically-<br>
active ingredient in the composition or may be combined with<br>
other active ingredients.<br>
Where the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility,<br>
methods for solubilizing may be used. Such methods are known<br>
and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents such as<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants such as Tween®,<br>
and dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of<br>
 the compounds, such as salts or prodrugs may also be used in<br>
formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The concentration of the compound is effective for<br>
delivery of an amount upon administration that lessens or<br>
ameliorates at least one symptom of the disorder for which the<br>
compound is administered. Typically, the compositions are<br>
formulated for single dosage administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared with<br>
carriers that protect them against rapid elimination from the<br>
body, such as time-release formulations or coatings. Such<br>
carriers include controlled release formulations, such as, but<br>
not limited to, microencapsulated delivery systems. The<br>
active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically<br>
useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on<br>
the patient treated. The therapeutically effective<br>
concentration may be determined empirically by testing the<br>
compounds in known in vitro and in vivo model systems for the<br>
treated disorder.<br>
 The compounds and compositions of the invention can be<br>
enclosed in multiple or single dose containers. The enclosed<br>
compounds and compositions can be provided in kits, for<br>
example, including component parts that can be assembled for<br>
use. For example, a compound inhibitor in lyophilized form<br>
and a suitable diluent may be provided as separated components<br>
for combination prior to use. A kit may include a compound<br>
inhibitor and a second therapeutic agent for co-<br>
administration. The inhibitor and second therapeutic agent<br>
may be provided as separate component parts. A kit may<br>
include a plurality of containers, each container holding one<br>
or more unit dose of the compound of the invention. The<br>
containers are preferably adapted for the desired mode of<br>
administration, including, but not limited to tablets, gel<br>
capsules, sustained-release capsules, and the like for oral<br>
administration; depot products, pre-filled syringes, ampoules,<br>
vials, and the like for parenteral administration; and<br>
patches, medipads, creams, and the like for topical<br>
administration.<br>
The concentration of active compound in. the drug<br>
composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, and<br>
excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule,<br>
and amount administered as well as other factors known to<br>
those of skill in the art.<br>
The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may<br>
be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered<br>
at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise<br>
dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease<br>
being treated and may be determined empirically using known<br>
testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro<br>
test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage<br>
values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be<br>
alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any<br>
particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be<br>
adjusted over time according to the individual need and the<br>
professional judgment of the person administering or<br>
supervising the administration of the compositions, and that<br>
the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the<br>
claimed compositions.<br>
If oral administration is desired, the compound should be<br>
provided in a composition that protects it from the acidic<br>
environment of the stomach. For example, the composition can<br>
be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its<br>
integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in<br>
the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in<br>
combination with an antacid or other such ingredient.<br>
Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent<br>
or an edible carrier and may be compressed into tablets or<br>
enclosed in gelatin capsules. For the purpose of oral<br>
therapeutic administration, the active compound or compounds<br>
can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of<br>
tablets, capsules, or troches. Pharmaceutically compatible<br>
binding agents and adjuvant materials can be included as part<br>
of the composition.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like can<br>
contain any of the following ingredients or compounds of a<br>
similar nature: a binder such as, but not limited to, gum<br>
tragacanth, acacia, corn starch, or gelatin; an excipient such<br>
as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, or lactose; a<br>
disintegrating agent such as, but not limited to, alginic acid<br>
and corn starch; a lubricant such as, but not limited to,<br>
magnesium stearate; a gildant, such as, but not limited to,<br>
colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose<br>
or saccharin; and a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl<br>
salicylate, or fruit flavoring.<br>
When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain,<br>
in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier<br>
such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can<br>
contain various other materials, which modify the physical<br>
form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and<br>
other enteric agents. The compounds can also be administered<br>
as a component of an elixir, -suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing<br>
gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the<br>
active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain<br>
preservatives, dyes and colorings, and flavors.<br>
The active materials can also be mixed with other active<br>
materials that do not impair the desired action, or with<br>
materials that supplement the desired action.<br>
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral,<br>
intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include<br>
any of the following components: a sterile diluent such as<br>
water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, a naturally<br>
occurring vegetable oil such as sesame oil, coconut oil,<br>
peanut oil, cottonseed oil, and the like, or a synthetic fatty<br>
vehicle such as ethyl oleate, and the like, polyethylene<br>
glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic<br>
solvent; antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and<br>
methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and sodium<br>
bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic<br>
acid (EDTA); buffers such as acetates, citrates, and<br>
phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as<br>
sodium chloride and dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be<br>
enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose<br>
vials made of glass, plastic, or other suitable material.<br>
Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be<br>
incorporated as required.<br>
Where administered intravenously, suitable carriers<br>
include physiological saline, phosphate buffered saline (PBS),<br>
and solutions containing thickening and solubilizing agents<br>
such as glucose, polyethylene glycol, polypropyleneglycol, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Liposomal suspensions including tissue-<br>
targeted liposomes may also be suitable as pharrnaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to<br>
methods known for example, as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4, 522,811.<br>
The active compounds may be prepared with carriers that<br>
protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body,<br>
such as time-release formulations or coatings. Such carriers<br>
include controlled release formulations, such as, but not<br>
limited to, implants and microencapsulated delivery systems,<br>
and biodegradable, biocompatible polymeirs such as collagen,<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid,<br>
polyorthoesters, polylactic acid, and the like. Methods for<br>
preparation of such formulations are known to those in the<br>
art.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
orally, parenterally (IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo-SQ),<br>
sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally,<br>
topically, or rectally. Dosage forms known to those skilled<br>
in the art are suitable for delivery of the compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be administered enterally<br>
or parenterally. When administered orally, compounds of the<br>
invention can be administered in usual dosage forms for oral<br>
administration as is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
These dosage forms include the usual solid unit dosage forms<br>
of tablets and capsules as well as liquid dosage forms such as<br>
solutions, suspensions, and elixirs. When the solid dosage<br>
forms are used, it is preferred that they be of the sustained<br>
release type so that the compounds of the invention need to be<br>
administered only once or twice daily.<br>
The oral dosage forms are administered to the patient 1,<br>
2, 3, or 4 times daily. It is preferred that the compounds of<br>
the invention be administered either three or fewer times,<br>
more preferably once or twice daily. Hence, it is preferred<br>
that the compounds of the invention be administered in oral<br>
dosage form. It is preferred that whatever oral dosage form<br>
is used, that it be designed so as to protect the compounds of<br>
the invention from the acidic environment of the stomach.<br>
Enteric coated tablets are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art. In addition, capsules filled with small spheres each<br>
coated to protect from the acidic stomach, are also well known<br>
to those- skilled in the art.<br>
When administered orally, an administered amount<br>
therapeutically effective to inhibit beta-secretase activity,<br>
to inhibit A beta production, to inhibit A beta deposition, or<br>
to treat or prevent AD is from about 0.1 mg/day to about 1,000<br>
mg/day. It is preferred that the oral dosage is from about 1<br>
mg/day to about 100 mg/day. It is more preferred that the<br>
oral dosage is from about 5 mg/day to about 50 mcf/day. It is<br>
understood that while a patient may be started at one dose,<br>
that dose may be varied over time as the patient's condition<br>
changes.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be advantageously<br>
delivered in a nano crystal dispersion formulation.<br>
Preparation of such formulations is described, for example, in<br>
U.S. Patent 5,145,684. Nano crystalline dispersions of HIV<br>
protease inhibitors and their method of use are described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,045,829. The nano crystalline formulations<br>
typically afford greater bioavailability of drug compounds.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
parenterally, for example, by IV, IM, depo-IM, SC, or depo-SC.<br>
When administered parenterally, a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of about 0.5 to about 100 mg/day, preferably from about<br>
5 to about 50 mg daily should be delivered. When a depot<br>
formulation is used for injection once a month or once every<br>
two weeks, the dose should be about 0.5 mg/day to about 50<br>
mg/day, or a monthly dose of from about 15 mg to about 1,500<br>
mg. In part because of the forgetfulness of the patients with<br>
Alzheimer's disease, it is preferred that the parenteral<br>
dosage form be a depo formulation.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
sublingually. When given sublingually, the compounds of the<br>
invention should be given one to four times daily in the<br>
amounts described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
intranasally. When given by this route, the appropriate<br>
dosage forms are a nasal spray or dry powder, as is known to<br>
those skilled in the art. The dosage of the compounds of the<br>
invention for intranasal administration is the amount<br>
described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
intrathecally. When given by this route the appropriate<br>
dosage form can be a parenteral dosage form as is known to<br>
those skilled in the art. The dosage of the compounds of the<br>
invention for intrathecal administration is the amount<br>
described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
topically. When given by this route, the appropriate dosage<br>
form is a cream, ointment, or patch. Because of the amount of<br>
the compounds of the invention to be administered, the patch<br>
is preferred. When administered topically, the dosage is from<br>
about 0.5 mg/day to about 200 mg/day. Because the amount that<br>
can be delivered by a patch is limited,, two or more patches<br>
may be used. The number and size of the patch is not<br>
important, what is important is that a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of the compounds of the invention be<br>
delivered as is known to those skilled in the: art. The<br>
compounds of the invention can be administered rectally by<br>
suppository as is known to those skilled in the art. When<br>
administered by suppository, the therapeutically effective<br>
amount is from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered by<br>
implants as is known to those skilled in the art. When<br>
administering a compound of the invention by implant, the<br>
therapeutically effective amount is the amount described above<br>
for depot administration.<br>
Given a particular compound of the invention and a<br>
desired dosage form, one skilled in the art would know how to<br>
prepare and administer the appropriate dosage form.<br>
The compounds of the invention are used in the same<br>
manner, by the same routes of administration, using the same<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms, and at the same dosing schedule<br>
as described above, for preventing disease or treating<br>
patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and preventing<br>
or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease in those who<br>
would progress from MCI to AD, for treating or preventing<br>
Down's syndrome, for treating humans who have Hereditary<br>
Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type, for<br>
treating cerebral amyloid angiopathy and preventing its<br>
potential consequences, i.e. single and recurrent lobar<br>
hemorrhages, for treating other degenerative dementias,<br>
including dementias of mixed vascular and degenerative origin,<br>
dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia<br>
associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia<br>
associated with cortical basal degeneration, and diffuse Lewy<br>
body type of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used in<br>
combination, with each other or with other therapeutic agents<br>
or approaches used to treat or prevent the conditions listed<br>
above. Such agents or approaches include: acetylcholine<br>
esterase inhibitors such as tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine,<br>
marketed as COGNEX®), donepezil hydrochloride, (marketed as<br>
Aricept® and rivastigmine (marketed as Exelon®); gamma-<br>
secretase inhibitors; anti-inflammatory agents such as<br>
cyclooxygenase II inhibitors; anti-oxidants such as Vitamin E<br>
and ginkolides; immunological approaches, such as, for<br>
example, immunization with A beta peptide or administration of<br>
anti-A beta peptide antibodies; statins; and direct or<br>
indirect neurotropic agents such as Cerebrolysin®, AIT-082<br>
(Emilieu, 2000, Arch. Neurol. 57:454), and other neurotropic<br>
agents of the future.<br>
In addition, the compounds of formula (I) can also be<br>
used with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp<br>
inhibitors and the use of such compounds are known to those<br>
skilled in the art. See for example, Cancer Research, 53,<br>
4595-4602 (1993), Clin. Cancer Res., 2, 7-12 (1996), Cancer<br>
Research, 56, 4171-41.79 (1996), International Publications<br>
WO99/64001 and WO01/10387. The important thing is that the<br>
blood level of the P-gp inhibitor be such that it exerts its<br>
effect in inhibiting P-gp from decreasing brain blood levels<br>
of the compounds of formula (A). To that end the P-gp<br>
inhibitor and the compounds of formula (A) can be administered<br>
at the same time, by the same or different route of<br>
administration, or at different times. The important thing is<br>
not the time of administration but having an effective blood<br>
level of the P-gp inhibitor.<br>
Suitable P-gp inhibitors include cyclosporin A,<br>
verapamil, tamoxifen, quinidine, Vitamin E-TGPS,. ritonavir,<br>
megestrol acetate, progesterone, rapamycin, 10,11-<br>
methanodibenzosuberane, phenothiazines, acridine derivatives<br>
such as GF120918, FK506, VX-710, LY335979, PSC-833, GF-102,918<br>
and other steroids. It is to be understood that additional<br>
agents will be found that have the same function and therefore<br>
achieve the same outcome; such compounds are also considered<br>
to be useful.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be administered orally,<br>
parenterally, (IV, IM, IM-depo, SQ, SQ-depo), topically,<br>
sublingually, rectally, intranasally, intrathecally and by<br>
implant.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of the P-gp<br>
inhibitors is from about 0.1 to about 300 mg/kg/day,<br>
preferably about 0.1 to about 150 mg/kg daily. It is<br>
understood that, while a patient may be started on one dose,<br>
that dose may have to be varied over time as the patient's<br>
condition changes.<br>
When administered orally, the P-gp inhibitors can be<br>
administered in usual dosage forms for oral administration as<br>
is known to those skilled in the art. These dosage forms<br>
include the usual solid unit dosage forms of tablets and<br>
capsules as well as liquid dosage forms such as solutions,<br>
suspensions and elixirs. When the solid dosage forms are<br>
used, it is preferred that they be of the sustained release<br>
type, so that the P-gp inhibitors need to be administered only<br>
once or twice daily. The oral dosage forms are administered<br>
to the patient one thru four times daily. It is preferred<br>
that the P-gp inhibitors be administered either three or fewer<br>
times a day, more preferably once or twice daily. Hence, it<br>
is preferred that the P-gp inhibitors be: administered in solid<br>
dosage form and further it is preferred that the solid dosage<br>
form be a sustained release form which permits once or twice<br>
daily dosing. It is preferred that what ever dosage form is<br>
used, that it be designed so as to protect, the P-gp inhibitors<br>
from the acidic environment of the stomach. Enteric coated<br>
tablets are well known to those skilled in the art. In<br>
addition, capsules filled with small spheres each coated to<br>
protect from the acidic stomach, are also well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
In addition, the P-gp inhibitors can be administered<br>
parenterally. When administered parenterally they can be<br>
administered IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ or depo-SQ.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given sublingually. When<br>
given sublingually, the P-gp inhibitors should be given one<br>
thru four times daily in the same amount as for IM<br>
administration.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given intranasally. When<br>
given by this route of administration, the appropriate dosage<br>
forms are a nasal spray or dry powder as is known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The dosage of the; P-gp inhibitors for<br>
intranasal administration is the same as for IM<br>
administration.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given intrathecally. When<br>
given by this route of administration the appropriate dosage<br>
form can be a parenteral dosage form as is known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given topically. when given<br>
by this route of administration, the appropriate dosage form<br>
is a cream, ointment or patch. Because of the amount of the<br>
P-gp inhibitors needed to be administered the patch is<br>
preferred. However, the amount that can be delivered by a<br>
patch is limited. Therefore, two or more patches may be<br>
required. The number and size of the patch is not important,<br>
what is important is that a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of the P-gp inhibitors be delivered as is known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be administered rectally by<br>
suppository or by implants, both of which are known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
There is nothing novel about the route of administration<br>
nor the dosage forms for administering the P-gp inhibitors.<br>
Given a particular P-gp inhibitor, and a desired dosage form,<br>
one skilled in the art would know how to prepare the<br>
appropriate dosage form for the P-gp inhibitor.<br>
It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the<br>
exact dosage and frequency of administration will depend on<br>
the particular compounds of the invention administered, the<br>
particular condition being treated, the severity of the<br>
condition being treated, the age, weight, general physical<br>
condition of the particular patient, and other medication the<br>
individual may be taking as is well known to administering<br>
physicians who are skilled in this art.<br>
Inhibition of APP Cleavage<br>
The compounds of the invention inhibit cleavage of APP<br>
between Met595 and Asp596 numbered for the APP695 isoform, or<br>
a mutant thereof, or at a corresponding site of a different<br>
isoform, such as APP.751 or APP770, or a mutant thereof<br>
(sometimes referred to as the "beta secretase site"). While<br>
not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, inhibition of<br>
beta-secretase activity is thought to inhibit production of<br>
beta amyloid peptide (A beta). Inhibitory activity is<br>
demonstrated in one of a variety of inhibition assays, whereby<br>
cleavage of an APP substrate in the presence of a beta-<br>
secretase enzyme is analyzed, in the presence of the inhibitory<br>
compound, under conditions normally sufficient to result in<br>
cleavage at the beta-secretase cleavage site. Reduction of<br>
APP cleavage at the beta-secretase cleavage site compared with<br>
an untreated or inactive control is correlated with inhibitory-<br>
activity. Assay systems that can be used to demonstrate<br>
efficacy of the compound inhibitors of the invention are<br>
known. Representative assay systems are described, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patents No. 5,942,400, 5,744,346, as well as<br>
in the Examples below.<br>
The enzymatic activity of beta-secretase and the<br>
production of A beta can be analyzed in vitro or in vivo,<br>
using natural, mutated, and/or synthetic APP substrates,<br>
natural, mutated, and/or synthetic enzyme, and the test<br>
compound. The analysis may involve primary or secondary cells<br>
expressing - native, mutant, and/or synthetic APP and enzyme,<br>
animal models expressing native APP and enzyme, or may utilize<br>
transgenic animal models expressing the substrate; and enzyme.<br>
Detection of enzymatic activity can be by analysis of one or<br>
more of the cleavage products, for example, by immunoassay,<br>
fluorometric or chromogenic assay, HPLC, or other means of<br>
detection. Inhibitory compounds are determined as those<br>
having the ability to decrease the amount of beta-secretase<br>
cleavage product produced in comparison to a control, where<br>
beta-secretase mediated cleavage in the reaction system is<br>
observed and measured in the absence of inhibitory compounds.<br>
Beta-Secretase<br>
Various forms of beta-secretase enzyme are known, and are<br>
available and useful for assay of enzyme activity and<br>
inhibition of enzyme activity. These include native,<br>
recombinant, and synthetic forms of the enzyme. Human beta-<br>
secretase is known as Beta Site APP Cleaving Enzyme (BACE),<br>
Asp2, and memapsin 2, and has been characterized, for example,<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,744,346 and published PCT patent<br>
applications WO98/22597, WO00/03819, WO0l/23533, and<br>
WO00/17369, as well as in literature publications (Hussain et<br>
al., 1999, Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 14:419-427; Vassar et al.,<br>
1999, Science 286:735-741; Yan et al., 1999, Nature 402:533-<br>
537; Sinha et al., 1999, Nature 40:537-540; and Lin et al.,<br>
2000, PNAS USA 97:1456-1460). Synthetic forms of the enzyme<br>
have also been described (WO98/22597 and WO00/17369). Beta-<br>
secretase can be extracted and purified from human brain<br>
tissue and can be produced in cells, for example mammalian<br>
cells expressing recombinant enzyme.<br>
Preferred compounds are effective to inhibit 50% of beta-<br>
secretase enzymatic activity at a concentration of less than<br>
50 micromolar, preferably at a concentration of 10 micromolar<br>
or less, more preferably 1 micromolar or less, and most<br>
preferably 10 nanomolar or less.<br>
APP Substrate<br>
Assays that demonstrate inhibition of beta-secretase-<br>
mediated cleavage of APP can utilize any of the known forms of<br>
APP, including the 695 amino acid "normal" isotype described<br>
by Rang. et al., 1987, Nature 325:733-6, the 770 amino acid<br>
isotype described by Kitaguchi et. al., 1981, Nature 331:530-<br>
532, and variants such as the Swedish Mutation (KM670-1NL)<br>
(APP-SW), the London Mutation (V7176F), and others. See, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 5,766,846 and also Hardy, 1992,<br>
Nature Genet. 1:233-234,- for a review of known variant<br>
mutations. Additional useful substrates; include the dibasic<br>
amino acid modification, APP-KK disclosed, for example, in WO<br>
00/17369, fragments of APP, and synthetic peptides containing<br>
the beta-secretase cleavage site, wild type (WT) or mutated<br>
form, e.g., SW, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No<br>
5,942,400 and WO00/03819.<br>
The APP substrate contains the beta-secretase cleavage<br>
site of APP (KM-DA or NL-DA) for example, a complete APP<br>
peptide or variant, an APP fragment, a recombinant or<br>
synthetic APP, or a fusion peptide. Preferably, the fusion<br>
peptide includes the beta-secretase cleavage site fused to a<br>
peptide having a moiety useful for enzymatic assay, for<br>
example, having isolation and/or detection properties. A<br>
useful moiety may be an antigenic epitope for antibody<br>
binding, a label or other detection moiety, a binding<br>
substrate, and the like.<br>
Antibodies<br>
Products characteristic of APP cleavage can be measured<br>
by immunoassay using various antibodies, as described, for<br>
example, in Pirttila et al., 1999, Neuro. Lett. 249:21-4, and<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,612,486. Useful antibodies to detect A<br>
beta include, for example, the monoclonal antibody 6E10<br>
(Senetek, St. Louis, MO) that specifically recognizes an<br>
epitope on amino acids 1-16 of the A beta peptide; antibodies<br>
162 and 164 (New York State Institute for Basic Research,<br>
Staten Island, NY) that are specific for human A beta 1-40 and<br>
1-42, respectively; and antibodies that recognize the junction<br>
region of beta-amyloid peptide, the site between residues 16<br>
and 17, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,593,846. Antibodies<br>
raised against a synthetic peptide of residues 591 to 596 of<br>
APP and SW192 antibody raised against 590-596 of the Swedish<br>
mutation are also useful in immunoassay of APP and its<br>
cleavage products, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,604,102<br>
and 5,721,13 0.<br>
Assay Systems<br>
Assays for determining APP cleavage at the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site are well known in the art. Exemplary assays,<br>
are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,744,346 and<br>
5,942,400, and described in the Examples below.<br>
Cell Free Assays<br>
¦ Exemplary assays that can be used to demonstrate the<br>
inhibitory activity of the compounds of the invention are<br>
described, for example, in WO00/17369, WO 00/03819, and U.S.<br>
Patents No. 5,942,400 and 5,744,346. Such assays can be<br>
performed in cell-free incubations or in cellular incubations<br>
using cells expressing a beta-secretase and an APP substrate<br>
having a beta-secretase cleavage site.<br>
An APP substrate containing the beta-secretase cleavage<br>
site of APP, for example, a complete APP or variant, an APP<br>
fragment, or a recombinant or synthetic APP substrate<br>
containing the amino acid sequence: KM-DA or NL-DA, is<br>
incubated in the presence of beta-secretase enzyme, a<br>
fragment thereof, or a synthetic or recombinant polypeptide<br>
variant having beta-secretase activity and effective to cleave<br>
the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP, under incubation<br>
conditions suitable for the cleavage activity of the enzyme.<br>
Suitable substrates optionally include derivatives that may be<br>
fusion proteins or peptides that contain the substrate peptide<br>
and a modification useful to facilitate the purification or<br>
detection of the peptide or its beta-secretase cleavage<br>
products. Useful modifications include the insertion of a<br>
known antigenic epitope for antibody binding; the linking of a<br>
label or detectable moiety, the linking of a binding<br>
substrate, and the like.<br>
Suitable incubation conditions for a cell-free in vitro<br>
assay include, for example: approximately 200 nanomolar to 10<br>
micromolar substrate, approximately 10 to 200 picomolar<br>
enzyme, and approximately 0.1 nanomolar to 10 micromolar<br>
inhibitor compound, in aqueous solution, at an approximate pH<br>
of 4 -7, at approximately 37 degrees C, for a time period of<br>
approximately 10 minutes to 3 hours. These incubation<br>
conditions are exemplary only, and can be varied as required<br>
for the particular assay components and/or desired measurement<br>
system. Optimization of the incubation conditions for the<br>
particular assay components should account for the specific<br>
beta-secretase enzyme used and its pH optimum, any additional<br>
enzymes and/or markers that might be used in the assay, and<br>
the like. Such optimization is routine and will not require<br>
undue experimentation.<br>
One useful assay utilizes a fusion peptide having maltose<br>
binding protein (MBP) fused to the C-terminal 125 amino acids<br>
of APP-SW. The MBP portion is captured on an assay substrate<br>
by anti-MBP capture antibody. Incubation of the captured<br>
fusion protein in the presence of beta-secretase results in<br>
cleavage of the substrate at the beta-secretase cleavage site.<br>
Analysis of the cleavage activity can be, for example, by<br>
immunoassay of cleavage products. One such immunoassay<br>
detects a unique epitope exposed at the carboxy terminus of<br>
the cleaved fusion protein, for example, using the antibody<br>
SW192. This assay is described, for example, in U.S. Patent<br>
No 5,942,400.<br>
Cellular Assay<br>
Numerous cell-based assays can be used to analyze beta-<br>
secretase activity and/or processing of APP to release- A beta.<br>
Contact of an APP substrate with a beta-secretase enzyme<br>
within the cell and in the presence or absence of a compound<br>
inhibitor of the invention can be used to demonstrate beta-<br>
secretase inhibitory activity of the compound. Preferably,<br>
assay in the presence of a useful inhibitory compound provides<br>
at least about 30%, most preferably at least about 50%<br>
inhibition of the enzymatic activity, as compared with a non-<br>
inhibited control.<br>
In one embodiment, cells that naturally express beta-<br>
secretase are used. Alternatively, cells are modified to<br>
express a recombinant beta-secretase or synthetic variant<br>
enzyme as discussed above. The APP substrate may be added to<br>
the culture medium and is preferably expressed in the cells.<br>
Cells that naturally express APP, variant or mutant forms of<br>
APP, or cells transformed to express an isoform of APP, mutant<br>
or variant APP, recombinant or synthetic APP, APP fragment, or<br>
synthetic APP peptide or fusion protein containing the beta-<br>
secretase APP cleavage site can be used, provided that the<br>
expressed APP is permitted to contact the enzyme and enzymatic<br>
cleavage activity can be analyzed.<br>
Human cell lines that normally process A beta from APP<br>
provide a useful means to assay inhibitory activities of the<br>
compounds of the invention. Production and release of A beta<br>
and/or other cleavage products into the culture medium can be<br>
measured, for example by immunoassay, such as Western blot or<br>
enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) such as by ELISA.<br>
Cells expressing an APP substrate and an active beta-<br>
secretase can be incubated in the presence of a compound<br>
inhibitor to demonstrate inhibition of enzymatic activity as<br>
compared with a control. Activity of beta-secretase can be<br>
measured by analysis of one or more cleavage products of the<br>
APP substrate. For example, inhibition of beta-secretase<br>
activity against the substrate APP would be expected to<br>
decrease release of specific beta-secretase induced APP<br>
cleavage products such as A beta.<br>
Although both neural and non-neural cells process and<br>
release A beta, levels of endogenous beta-secretase activity<br>
are low and often difficult to detect by EIA. The use of cell<br>
types known to have enhanced beta-secretase activity, enhanced<br>
processing of APP to A beta, and/or enhanced production of A<br>
beta are therefore preferred. For example, transfection of<br>
cells with the Swedish Mutant form of APP (APP-SW) ; with APP-<br>
KK; or with APP-SW-KK provides cells having enhanced beta-<br>
secretase activity and producing amounts of A beta that can be<br>
readily measured.<br>
In such assays, for example, the cells expressing APP and<br>
beta-secretase are incubated in a culture medium under<br>
conditions suitable for beta-secretase enzymatic activity at<br>
its cleavage site on the APP substrate. On exposure of the<br>
cells to the compound inhibitor, the amount of A beta released<br>
into the medium and/or the amount of CTF99 fragments of APP in<br>
the cell lysates is reduced as compared with the control. The<br>
ravage products of APP can be analyzed, for example, by<br>
pune reactions with specific antibodies, as discussed above.<br>
preferred cells for analysis of beta-secretase activity<br>
include primary human neuronal cells, primary transgenic<br>
animal neuronal cells where the transgene is APP, and other<br>
cells such as those of a stable 2 93 cell line expressing APP,<br>
for example, APP-SW.<br>
In vivo Assays: Animal Models<br>
Various animal models can be used to analyze beta-<br>
secretase activity and /or processing of APP to release A<br>
beta, as described above. For example, transgenic animals<br>
expressing APP substrate and beta-secretase enzyme can be used<br>
to demonstrate inhibitory activity of the compounds of the<br>
invention. Certain transgenic animal models have been<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,877,399;<br>
5,612,486; 5,387,742; 5,720,936; 5,850,003; 5,877,015,, and<br>
5,811,633, and in Ganes et al., 1995, Nature 373:523.<br>
Preferred are animals that exhibit characteristics associated<br>
with the pathophysiology of AD. Administration of the<br>
compound inhibitors of the invention to the transgenic mice<br>
described herein provides an alternative method for<br>
demonstrating the inhibitory activity of the compounds.<br>
Administration of the compounds in a pharmaceutically<br>
effective carrier and via an administrative route that reaches<br>
the target tissue in an appropriate therapeutic amount is also<br>
preferred.<br>
Inhibition of beta-secretase mediated cleavage of APP at<br>
the beta-secretase cleavage site and of A beta release can be<br>
analyzed in these animals by measure of cleavage fragments in<br>
the animal's body fluids such as cerebral fluid or tissues.<br>
Analysis of brain tissues for A beta deposits or plaques is<br>
preferred.<br>
On contacting an APP substrate with a beta-secretase<br>
enzyme in the presence of an inhibitory compound of the<br>
mention and under conditions sufficient to permit enzymatic<br>
me ted cleavage of APP and/or release of A beta from the<br>
substitute, the compounds of the invention are effective to<br>
reduce beta-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP at the beta-<br>
secretase cleavage site and/or effective to reduce released<br>
amounts of A beta. Where such contacting is the<br>
administration of the inhibitory compounds of the invention to<br>
an animal model, for example, as described above, the<br>
compounds are effective to reduce A beta deposition in brain<br>
tissues of the animal, and to reduce the number and/or size of<br>
beta amyloid plaques. Where such administration is to a human<br>
subject, the compounds are effective to inhibit or slow the<br>
progression of disease characterized by enhanced amounts of A<br>
beta, to slow the progression of AD in the, and/or to prevent<br>
onset or development of AD in a patient at risk for the<br>
disease.<br>

BIOLOGY EXAMPLES<br>
Example A<br>
Enzyme Inhibition Assay<br>
The compounds of the invention are analyzed for<br>
inhibitory activity by use of the MBP-C125 assay.. This assay<br>
determines the relative inhibition of beta-secretase cleavage<br>
of a model APP substrate, MBP-C125SW, by the compounds assayed<br>
as compared with an untreated control. A detailed description<br>
of the assay parameters can be found, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,942,400. Briefly, the substrate is a fusion<br>
peptide formed of maltose binding protein (MBP) and the<br>
carboxy terminal 125 amino acids of APP-SW, the Swedish<br>
mutation. The beta-secretase enzyme is derived from human<br>
brain tissue as described in Sinha et al, 1999, Nature 40:537-<br>
54 0) or recombinantly produced as the full-length enzyme<br>
(amino acids 1-501), and can be prepared, for example, from<br>
293 cells expressing the recombinant cDNA, as described in<br>
WO00/47618.<br>
Inhibition of the enzyme is analyzed, for example, by<br>
immunoassay of the enzyme's cleavage products. One exemplary<br>
ELISA uses an anti-MBP capture antibody that is deposited on<br>
precoated and blocked 96-well high binding plates, followed by<br>
incubation with diluted enzyme reaction supernatant,<br>
incubation with a specific reporter antibody, for example,<br>
biotinylated anti-SW192 reporter antibody, and further<br>
incubation with streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase. In the<br>
assay, cleavage of the intact MBP-C125SW fusion protein<br>
results in the generation of a truncated amino-terminal<br>
fragment, exposing a new SW-192 antibody-positive epitope at<br>
the carboxy terminus. Detection is effected by a fluorescent<br>
substrate signal on cleavage by the phosphatase. ELISA only<br>
detects cleavage following Leu 596 at the substrate's APP-SW<br>
751 mutation site.<br>
Specific Assay Procedure:<br>
Compounds are diluted in a 1:1 dilution series to a six-<br>
point concentration curve (two wells per concentration) in one<br>
96-plate row per compound tested. Each of the test compounds<br>
is prepared in DMSO to make up a 10 millimolar stock solution.<br>
The stock solution is serially diluted in DMSO to obtain a<br>
final compound concentration of 2 00 micromolar at the high<br>
point of a 6-point dilution curve. Ten (10) microliters of<br>
each dilution is added to each of two wells on row C of a<br>
corresponding V-bottom plate to which 190 microliters of 52<br>
millimolar NaOAc, 7.9% DMSO, pH 4.5 are pre-added. The NaOAc<br>
diluted compound plate is spun down to pellet precipitant and<br>
20 microliters/well is transferred to a corresponding flat-<br>
bottom plate to which 30 microliters of ice-cold enzyme-<br>
substrate mixture (2.5 microliters MBP-C125SW substrate, 0.03<br>
microliters enzyme and 24.5 microliters ice cold 0.09% TX100<br>
per 30 microliters) is added. The final reaction mixture of<br>
200 micromolar compound at the highest curve point is in 5%<br>
DMSO, 20 millimolar NaOAc, 0.06% TX100, at pH 4.5.<br>
Warming the plates to. 37 degrees C starts the enzyme<br>
reaction. After 90 minutes at 37 degrees C, 200<br>
microliters/well cold specimen diluent is added to stop the<br>
reaction and 2 0 microliters/well was transferred to a<br>
corresponding anti-MBP antibody coated ELISA plate for<br>
capture, containing 80 microliters/well specimen diluent.<br>
This reaction is incubated overnight at 4 degrees C and the<br>
ELISA is developed the next day after a 2 hour incubation with<br>
anti-192SW antibody, followed by Streptavidin-AP conjugate and<br>
fluorescent substrate. The signal is read on a fluorescent<br>
plate reader.<br>
Relative compound inhibition potency is determined by<br>
calculating the concentration of compound that showed a fifty<br>
percent reduction in detected signal (IC50) compared to the<br>
enzyme reaction signal in the control wells with no added<br>
compound. In this assay, preferred compounds of- the invention<br>
exhibit an IC50 of'less than 50 micromolar.<br>
Example B<br>
Cell Free Inhibition Assay Utilizing a Synthetic APP<br>
Substrate<br>
A synthetic APP substrate that can be cleaved by beta-<br>
secretase and having N-terminal biotin and made fluorescent by<br>
the covalent attachment of Oregon green at the Cys residue is<br>
used to assay beta-secretase activity in the presence or<br>
absence of the inhibitory compounds of the invention. Useful<br>
substrates include the following:<br>
Biotin-SEVNL-DAEFRC[oregon green]KK [SEQ ID NO:<br>

The enzyme (0.1 nanomolar) and test compounds (0.001-100<br>
micromolar) are incubated in pre-blocked, low affinity, black<br>
plates (384 well) at 37 degrees for 30 minutes. The reaction<br>
is initiated by addition of 150 millimolar substrate to a<br>
final volume of 30 microliter per well. The final assay<br>
conditions are: 0.001-100 micromolar compound inhibitor; 0.1<br>
molar sodium acetate (pH 4.5); 150 nanomolar substrate; 0.1<br>
nanomolar soluble beta-secretase; 0.001% Tween 20, and 2%<br>
DMSO. The assay mixture is incubated for 3 hours at 37<br>
degrees C, and the reaction is terminated by the addition of a<br>
saturating concentration of immunopure streptavidin. After<br>
incubation with streptavidin at room temperature for 15<br>
minutes, fluorescence polarization is measured, for example,<br>
using a LJL Acqurest (Ex4 85 nm/ Em530 nm). The activity of<br>
the beta-secretase enzyme is detected by changes in the<br>
fluorescence polarization that occur when the substrate is<br>
cleaved by the enzyme. Incubation in the presence or absence<br>
of compound inhibitor demonstrates specific inhibition of<br>
beta-secretase enzymatic cleavage of its synthetic APP<br>
substrate. In this assay, preferred compounds of the<br>
invention exhibit an IC50 of less than 50 micromolar. More<br>
preferred compounds of the invention exhibit an IC50 of less<br>
than 10 micromolar. Even more preferred compounds of the<br>
invention exhibit an IC50 of less than 5 micromolar.<br>
Example C<br>
Beta-Secretase Inhibition; P26-P4'SW Assay<br>
Synthetic substrates containing the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site of APP are used to assay beta-secretase<br>
activity, using the methods described, for example, in<br>
published PCT application WO00/47618. The P26-P4'SW substrate<br>
is a peptide of the sequence:<br>
(biotin)CGGADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNLDAEF [SEQ ID NO:<br>
S]<br>
The P26-P1 standard has the sequence:<br>
(biotin)CGGADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL [SEQ ID NO:<br>
7].<br>
Briefly, the biotin-coupled synthetic substrates are<br>
incubated at a concentration of from about 0 to about 200<br>
micromolar in this assay. When testing inhibitory compounds,<br>
a substrate concentration of about 1.0 micromolar is<br>
preferred. Test compounds diluted in DMSO are added to the<br>
reaction mixture, with a final DMSO concentration of 5%.<br>
Controls also contain a final DMSO concentration of 5%. The<br>
concentration of beta secretase enzyme in the reaction is<br>
varied, to give product concentrations with the linear range<br>
of the ELISA assay, about 125 to 2000 picomolar, after<br>
dilution.<br>
The reaction mixture also includes 20 millimolar sodium<br>
acetate, pH 4.5, 0.06% Triton X100, and is incubated at 37<br>
degrees C for about 1 to.3 hours. Samples are then diluted in<br>
assay buffer (for example, 145.4 nanomolar sodium chloride,<br>
9.51 millimolar sodium phosphate, 7.7 millimolar sodium azide,<br>
0.05% Triton X405, 6g/liter bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to<br>
quench the reaction, then diluted further for immunoassay of<br>
the cleavage products.<br>
Cleavage products can be assayed by ELISA. Diluted<br>
samples and standards are incubated in assay plates coated<br>
with capture antibody, for example, SW192, for about 24 hours<br>
at 4 degrees C. After washing in TTBS buffer (150 millimolar<br>
sodium chloride, 25 millimolar Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5),<br>
the samples are incubated with streptavidin-AP according to<br>
the manufacturer's instructions. After a one hour incubation<br>
at room temperature, the samples are washed in TTBS and<br>
incubated with fluorescent substrate solution A (31.2 g/liter<br>
2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol, 30 mg/liter, pH 9.5). Reaction<br>
with streptavidin-alkaline phosphate permits detection by<br>
fluorescence. Compounds that are effective inhibitors of<br>
beta-secretase activity demonstrate reduced cleavage of the<br>
substrate as compared to a control.<br>
Example D<br>
Assays using Synthetic Oligopeptide-Substrates<br>
Synthetic oligopeptides are prepared that incorporate the<br>
known cleavage site of beta-secretase, and optionally<br>
detectable tags, such as fluorescent or chromogenic moieties.<br>
Examples of such peptides, as well as their production and<br>
detection methods are described in U.S. Patent No: 5,942,400,<br>
herein incorporated by reference. Cleavage products can be<br>
detected using high performance liquid chromatography, or<br>
fluorescent or chromogenic detection methods appropriate to<br>
the peptide to be detected, according to methods well known in<br>
the art.<br>
By way of example, one such peptide has the sequence<br>
SEVNL-DAEF [SEQ ID NO: 8], and the cleavage site is between<br>
residues 5 and 6. Another preferred substrate has the<br>
sequence ADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL-BAEF [SEQ ID NO: 9], and<br>
the cleavage site is between residues 26 and 27.<br>
These synthetic APP substrates are incubated in the<br>
presence of beta-secretase under conditions sufficient to<br>
result in beta-secretase mediated cleavage of the substrate.<br>
Comparison of the cleavage results in the presence of the<br>
compound inhibitor to control results provides a measure of<br>
the compound's inhibitory activity.<br>
Example E<br>
Inhibition of Beta-Secretase Activity - Cellular Assay<br>
An exemplary assay for the analysis of inhibition of<br>
beta-secretase activity utilizes the human embryonic kidney<br>
cell line HEKp293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1573) transfected<br>
with APP751 containing the naturally occurring double mutation<br>
Lys651Met52 to Asn651Leu652 (numbered for APP751), commonly<br>
called the Swedish mutation and- shown to overproduce A beta<br>
(Citron et al., 1992, Nature 360:672-674), as described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,604,102.<br>
The cells are incubated in the presence/absence of the<br>
inhibitory compound (diluted in DMSO) at the desired<br>
concentration, generally up to 10 micrograms/ml. At the end<br>
of the treatment period, conditioned media is analyzed for<br>
beta-secretase activity, for example, by analysis of cleavage<br>
fragments. A beta can be analyzed by immunoassay, using<br>
specific detection antibodies. The enzymatic activity is<br>
measured in the presence and absence of the compound<br>
inhibitors to demonstrate specific inhibition of beta-<br>
secretase mediated cleavage of APP substrate.<br>
Example F<br>
Inhibition o£ Beta-Secretase in Animal Models of AD<br>
Various animal models can be used to screen for<br>
inhibition of beta-secretase activity. Examples of animal<br>
models useful in the invention include, but are not limited<br>
to, mouse, guinea pig, dog, and the like. The animals used<br>
can be wild type, transgenic, or knockout models. In addition,<br>
mammalian models can express mutations in APP, such as APP695-<br>
SW and the like described herein. Examples of transgenic non-<br>
human mammalian models are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,604,102, 5,912,410 and 5,811,633.<br>
PDAPP mice, prepared as described in Games et al., 1995,<br>
Nature 373:523-527 are useful to analyze in vivo suppression<br>
of A beta release in the presence of putative inhibitory<br>
compounds. As described in U.S. Patent No. 6,191,166, 4 month<br>
old PDAPP mice are administered compound formulated in<br>
vehicle, such as corn oil. The mice are dosed with compound<br>
(1-30 mg/ml; preferably 1-10 mg/ml). After time, e.g., 3-10<br>
hours, the animals are sacrificed, and brains removed for<br>
analysis.<br>
Transgenic animals are administered an amount of the<br>
compound inhibitor formulated in a carrier suitable for the<br>
chosen mode of administration. Control animals are untreated,<br>
treated with vehicle, or treated with an inactive compound.<br>
Administration can be acute, i.e., single dose or multiple<br>
doses in one day, or can be chronic, i.e., dosing is repeated<br>
daily for a period of days. Beginning at time 0, brain tissue<br>
or cerebral fluid is obtained from selected animals and<br>
analysed for the presence of APP cleavage peptides, including<br>
A beta, for example, by immunoassay using specific antibodies<br>
for A beta detection. At the end of the test period, animals<br>
are sacrificed and brain tissue or cerebral fluid is analyzed<br>
for the presence of A beta and/or beta-amyloid plaques. The<br>
tissue is also analyzed for necrosis.<br>
Animals administered the compound inhibitors of the<br>
invention are expected to demonstrate reduced A beta in brain<br>
tissues or cerebral fluids and reduced beta amyloid plaques<br>
in brain tissue, as compared with non-treated controls.<br>
Example 6<br>
Inhibition of A Beta Production in Human Patients<br>
Patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD)<br>
demonstrate an increased amount of A beta in the brain. AD<br>
patients are administered an amount of the compound inhibitor<br>
formulated in a carrier suitable for the chosen mode of<br>
administration. Administration is repeated daily for the<br>
duration of the test period. Beginning on day 0, cognitive<br>
and memory tests are performed, for example, once per month.<br>
Patients administered the compound inhibitors are<br>
expected to demonstrate slowing or stabilization of disease<br>
progression as analyzed by changes in one or more of the<br>
following disease parameters: A beta present in CSF or<br>
plasma; brain or hippocampal volume; A beta deposits in the<br>
brain; amyloid plaque in the brain; and scores for cognitive<br>
and memory function, as compared with control, non-treated<br>
patients.<br>
Example H<br>
Prevention of A Beta Production in Patients at Risk for<br>
AD<br>
Patients predisposed or at risk for developing AD " are<br>
identified either by recognition of a familial inheritance<br>
pattern, for example, presence of the Swedish Mutation, and/or<br>
by monitoring diagnostic parameters. Patients identified as<br>
predisposed or at risk for developing AD are administered an<br>
amount of the compound inhibitor formulated in a carrier<br>
suitable for the chosen mode of administration.<br>
Administration is repeated daily for the duration of the test<br>
period. Beginning on day 0, cognitive and memory tests are<br>
performed, for example, once per month.<br>
Patients administered the compound inhibitors are<br>
expected to demonstrate slowing or stabilization of disease<br>
progression as analyzed by changes in one or more of the<br>
following disease parameters: A beta present in CSF or plasma;<br>
brain or hippocampal volume; amyloid plaque in the brain; and<br>
scores for cognitive and memory function, as compared with<br>
control, non-treated patients.<br>
The invention has been described with reference to<br>
various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques.<br>
However, it should be understood that many variations and<br>
modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br>
