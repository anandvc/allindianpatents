				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COAXIAL PLUG-IN CONNECTOR ARRANGEMENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
detachable connection techniques for coaxial cables. It<br>
relates to a coaxial plug-in connector arrangement in<br>
accordance with the precharacterizing clause of Claim<br>
1.<br>
Such a plug-in connector arrangement is known, for<br>
example, from the document EP-B1-1 222 717.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In the past, specific plug-in connector systems have<br>
been developed for detachably connecting coaxial cables<br>
which make it possible to plug together and detach the<br>
plug-in connection rapidly without any screwing<br>
operation and at the same time ensure safe and<br>
permanent contacts is provided. Such plug-in connector<br>
systems, which are based on the principles explained in<br>
the document mentioned at the outset, are known on the<br>
market under the type designation QMA (Quick Lock SMA).<br>
A known embodiment of such a QMA plug-in connector<br>
system, as is produced and offered for sale by the<br>
Applicant, is reproduced in Figures 1-4. The system<br>
comprises two mutually fitting plug-in connectors 10<br>
(male; Figures 1, 2) and 20 (female; Figures 3, 4),<br>
which can be plugged one inside the other so as to<br>
automatically latch with one another and so as to<br>
produce and maintain sufficient axial contact pressure<br>
and can be detached again later by actuating an axially<br>
displaceable actuating sleeve (15 in Figures 1, 2).<br><br>
The male plug-in connector 10, which is illustrated in<br>
longitudinal section in Figure 1 and in the perspective<br>
side view in Figure 2, comprises a cylindrical housing<br>
11, which is coaxial with respect to a plug axis 17 and<br>
acts as an outer conductor, having a coaxial through-<br>
hole 11' having a stepped diameter, in which an inner<br>
conductor contact 12 is arranged concentrically such<br>
that it is insulated by means of an insulating piece<br>
13. In the front part of the plug-in connector 10, a<br>
tensioning sleeve 14, which is in contact with the<br>
housing 11, is inserted fixedly into the through-hole<br>
11', in which tensioning sleeve a collar of hook-shaped<br>
latching fingers 19, which spring out radially, are<br>
formed by a large number of axial slots 18. In the<br>
region of the tensioning sleeve 14, an axially<br>
displaceable actuating sleeve 15 surrounds the housing<br>
11 on the outside. At the front end of the actuating<br>
sleeve 15, a conically tapering unlatching ring 29 is<br>
integrally formed on the inner edge, and this<br>
unlatching ring engages in the collar of the latching<br>
fingers 19 and bends it radially outwards if the<br>
actuating sleeve 15 is displaced towards the rear in<br>
the axial direction. A clamping sleeve 16 is provided<br>
at the rear end of the plug-in connector 10, and this<br>
clamping sleeve can be used to fix the coaxial cable to<br>
the plug-in connector 10.<br>
The associated female plug-in connector 20, which is<br>
likewise shown in section and in a perspective side<br>
view in Figures 3 and 4, comprises a cylindrical<br>
housing 21, which is coaxial with respect to the plug<br>
axis 2 8 and acts as an outer conductor, having a<br>
concentric through-hole 21' and an inner conductor<br>
contact 22, which is held concentrically in the<br>
through-hole 21' by means of an insulating piece 24.<br>
The inner conductor contact 22 has, at the front end, a<br>
contact tube 23 with slots, and the inner conductor<br>
contact 12 of the male plug-in connector 10 enters this<br><br>
contact tube 23 when the plug-in connectors 10, 20 are<br>
plugged together. The outer conductor contact is<br>
produced by a contact sleeve 25, which surrounds the<br>
insulating piece 24 and with which the plug-in<br>
connector 2 0 enters the tensioning sleeve 14 of the<br>
plug-in connector 10 during the plugging-in operation<br>
and rests on the base of the tensioning sleeve 14. A<br>
clamping sleeve 26 for fixing the coaxial cable is<br>
likewise provided at the rear end of the plug-in<br>
connector 20.<br>
The resilient latching fingers 19 of the tensioning<br>
sleeve 14 in the process slide with their front, hook-<br>
shaped ends over a circumferential bead 27, which is<br>
formed on the outside of the contact sleeve 2 5 and<br>
increases slowly and then falls away comparatively<br>
steeply in terms of diameter. In this way, the latching<br>
fingers 19 latch in behind the bead 27 and exert a<br>
force acting in the plug-in direction on the contact<br>
sleeve 25, as is described in the document described at<br>
the outset EP-B1-1 222 717. The latching of the<br>
tensioning sleeve 14 and the contact sleeve 25 can be<br>
cancelled again by means of the actuating sleeve 15.<br>
The described plug system has proven to be successful<br>
in practice, but is not suitable for all application<br>
cases since the connection of the inner conductor<br>
contacts 12, 22 and housing parts imparting the outer<br>
conductor contact is not completely protected from<br>
undesirable influences from the outside, in particular<br>
water or moisture. Such suitable sealing appears to be<br>
problematic since restrictive conditions are provided<br>
in the contact region of the system by the tensioning<br>
sleeve 14, which springs out radially, and the axially<br>
displaceable actuating sleeve 15.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a coaxial<br>
plug-in connector arrangement of the described type<br>
which avoids the disadvantages of the known embodiments<br>
and is sealed off reliably from the outside in the<br>
contact region without any substantial changes to the<br>
contact geometry.<br>
The object is achieved by the combination of the<br>
features in Claim 1. The solution according to the<br>
invention is characterized by the fact that one or more<br>
seals are arranged within the tensioning means, which<br>
seals seal off the intermediate space between the<br>
contact sleeve and the through-hole of the second plug-<br>
in connector in the plugged-together state.<br>
One configuration of the invention is characterized by<br>
the fact that the tensioning sleeve engages behind a<br>
circumferential bead formed on the contact sleeve<br>
during the plugging-in operation with hook-shaped<br>
latching fingers, which extend counter to the plug-in<br>
direction and spring out radially, that the contact<br>
sleeve enters the through-hole of the second plug-in<br>
connector so as to provide contact during the plugging-<br>
in operation, that the tensioning sleeve is pushed on<br>
the outside fixedly onto the housing of the second<br>
plug-in connector, and that the at least one seal is<br>
annular and is arranged directly between the contact<br>
sleeve and the inner wall surrounding it of the<br>
through-hole of the second plug-in connector.<br>
In particular, it is advantageous owing to the<br>
simplicity of the design if the at least one seal is<br>
accommodated in the housing of the second plug-in<br>
connector, if a circumferential annular groove is<br>
provided in the inner wall of the through-hole of the<br>
second plug-in connector, and if the at least one seal<br><br>
is in the form of an 0 ring and is arranged in the<br>
annular groove.<br>
However, it is also conceivable within the context of<br>
the invention for the tensioning sleeve to be inserted<br>
fixedly into the through-hole of the second plug-in<br>
connector, and for the at least one seal to be arranged<br>
on the tensioning sleeve.<br>
It is also conceivable that, within the tensioning<br>
means, in order to detach the tensioning sleeve, an<br>
actuating sleeve, which can be displaced in the axial<br>
direction and surrounds the two plug-in connectors on<br>
the outside in the plugged-in state, is provided, and<br>
that the actuating sleeve is sealed off with respect to<br>
the two plug-in connectors.<br>
BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below<br>
with reference to exemplary embodiments in connection<br>
with the drawing, in which:<br>

art ;<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective side view of the plug-in<br>
connector from Figure 3;<br><br>
Figure 5 shows, in longitudinal section, a detail of a<br>
plugged-together plug-in connector arrange-<br>
ment in accordance with one preferred<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Figure 6 shows, in longitudinal section, the male<br>
plug-in connector of the plug-in connector<br>
arrangement from Figure 5.<br>
WAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE INVENTION<br>
A plugged-together plug-in connector arrangement in<br>
accordance with one preferred exemplary embodiment of<br>
the invention is reproduced in detail in Figure 5 in<br>
longitudinal section, and in Figure 6, the associated<br>
male plug-in connector, in which the sealing of the<br>
arrangement takes place, is reproduced on its own. The<br>
plug-in connector arrangement 30, 4 0 of the exemplary<br>
embodiment comprises a male plug-in connector 3 0 and a<br>
female plug-in connector 40.<br>
In principle, the female plug-in connector 40 may have<br>
the same design as in the prior art (Figures 3, 4) . It<br>
has a cylindrical housing 41 acting as an outer<br>
conductor and having a through-hole 50, which is<br>
coaxial with respect to the plug axis 47 and in which<br>
an inner conductor contact 42 is arranged coaxially by<br>
means of an insulating piece 44, which inner conductor<br>
contact becomes a contact tube 43 with slots at the<br>
front end of the plug-in connector 40. In the plugged-<br>
in state, the contact tube 43 accommodates the inner<br>
conductor contact 32 (Figure 6) of the male plug-in<br>
connector 30. The housing 41 of the plug-in connector<br>
4 0 becomes a contact sleeve 4 5 at the front end, which<br>
contact sleeve is inserted into the other plug-in<br>
connector 3 0 and produces the outer conductor contact<br>
there. At the rear end of the contact sleeve 45, a<br>
circumferential bead 46 is formed in a manner known per<br><br>
se, which bead has a slowly increasing diameter<br>
enlargement on the front side and, on the other hand, a<br>
comparatively severely falling diameter reduction in<br>
size on the rear side. The bead 46, in connection with<br>
a tensioning sleeve 34 on the male plug-in connector<br>
30, is used for latching the two plug-in connectors 30,<br>
4 0 and for producing an axial contact force, which<br>
presses the contact sleeve 45 against a diameter step<br>
49 in the plug-in connector 3 0 so as to provide contact<br>
with the end side.<br>
The male plug-in connector 3 0 (Figure 6) likewise has a<br>
cylindrical housing 31 (not completely illustrated in<br>
Figures 5, 6) having a through-hole 48, which is<br>
coaxial with respect to the plug axis 47. An inner<br>
conductor contact 32 is mounted coaxially in the<br>
through-hole 48 by means of an insulating piece 33. The<br>
through-hole 4 8 has a diameter step 49, on which the<br>
contact sleeve 45 of the other plug-in connector 40<br>
rests in the plugged-in state. The inner conductor<br>
contact 32 protrudes with its front end beyond the<br>
diameter step 4 9 and thus forms a contact plug which<br>
fits the contact tube 43.<br>
On the outside, a coaxial tensioning sleeve 34 is<br>
pushed onto the front end of the housing 31 so as to<br>
have a fixed fit, and spring-elastic latching fingers<br>
3 7 are formed on said tensioning sleeve by means of a<br>
plurality of axial slots, which latching fingers engage<br>
with their front, hook-shaped ends around the front end<br>
of the housing 31 and protrude radially into the<br>
through-hole 48. An actuating sleeve 35 is arranged so<br>
as to be axially displaceable coaxially over the<br>
tensioning sleeve 34 and can bend the latching arms 3 7<br>
for unlatching purposes radially outwards and forwards<br>
behind the bead 46 by means of a conical unlatching<br>
ring 36 if the actuating sleeve 35 is pushed towards<br>
the rear (downwards in Figure 6).<br><br>
Owing to the tensioning sleeve 34 which is fitted on<br>
the outside on the housing 31, the plug-in connector<br>
40, in the plugged-together state of the plug-in<br>
connector arrangement, bears with the contact sleeve 45<br>
directly against the inner wall of the through-hole 4 8<br>
and against the diameter step 49. This configuration<br>
provides the possibility of sealing off the contact<br>
region from the outside in a particularly simple manner<br>
by means of a seal arranged between the contact sleeve<br>
45 and the inner wall of the through-hole 48. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment in Figures 5, 6, such a seal 39 is<br>
accommodated, for reasons of space, in an annular<br>
groove 38 in the inner wall of the through-hole 48 and<br>
is preferably in the form of an O ring. It is also<br>
possible for a plurality of seals to be arranged<br>
axially one behind the other, as a result of which,<br>
however, the plug-in forces are increased. Owing to the<br>
seal 39, the contact region of the outer conductors on<br>
the diameter step 49 and the inner conductor contacts<br>
in the contact tube 43 are sealed off from the outside.<br>
However, other sealing configurations are also<br>
conceivable: if the tensioning sleeve - as is the case<br>
in the previously known plug arrangements shown in<br>
Figure 1 - is inserted fixedly into the through-hole of<br>
the second plug-in connector and the outer conductor<br>
contact is produced via the tensioning sleeve, it is<br>
expedient to arrange the seal or seals on the<br>
tensioning sleeve itself.<br>
However, it is also possible (with increased<br>
complexity), in a configuration shown in Figure 5, to<br>
seal off the actuating sleeve 3 5 from the housings 31<br>
and 41 of the two plug-in connectors 30, 4 0 using<br>
corresponding seals at the two ends of the actuating<br>
sleeve 35.<br><br>

through-hole (48, 50), in which through-hole an inner<br>
conductor contact (32, 42) is held in insulated fashion<br>
in a coaxial arrangement, a coaxial contact sleeve (45)<br>
being formed on the housing (41) of the first plug-in<br>
connector (40), with which sleeve this plug-in<br>
connector (40) enters the second plug-in connector (30)<br>
so as to provide contact when the two plug-in<br>
connectors (30, 40) are plugged one inside the other,<br>
and detachable tensioning means (34, 37) for<br>
prestressing the two plug-in connectors (30, 40) with<br>
respect to one another in the plugged-in state being<br>
provided on the second plug-in connector (30), which<br>
tensioning means comprise a coaxial tensioning sleeve<br>
(34), which coaxially surrounds the contact sleeve (45)<br>
in the plugged-in state and applies a force acting in<br>
the plug-in direction to it.<br>
With such a plug-in connector arrangement, sealing-off<br>
from the outside is achieved in a simple and space-<br>
saving manner by virtue of the fact that one or more<br>
seals (39) are arranged within the tensioning means<br>
(34, 37), which seals seal off the intermediate space<br>
between the contact sleeve (45) and the through-hole<br>
(48) of the second plug-in connector in the plugged-<br>
together state.</td>
