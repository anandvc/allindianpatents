				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HYDROPHILIC MICROPOROUS MEMBRANE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
hydrophilic microporous membrane suitable for removing<br>
microparticles such as viruses.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently in the refining process of a plasma<br>
derivative or a biopharmaceutical, there is a need for<br>
technology for removing pathogenic agents such as a<br>
virus and a pathogenic protein in order to enhance<br>
safety. Among the methods for removing pathogenic<br>
agents such as a virus is a membrane filtration method.<br>
Since the separation operation is conducted, in this<br>
membrane filtration method, according to the size of<br>
the particles based on the sieve principle, the method<br>
is efficacious for all the pathogenic agents<br>
irrespective of the type of pathogenic organism as well<br>
as the chemical or thermal characteristics of the<br>
pathogenic organism. Therefore, industrial utilization<br>
of the removal of pathogenic agents using the membrane<br>
filtration method has been prevailing in recent years.<br>
Since infection with an infectious virus<br>
among pathogenic agents may cause serious diseases,<br>
removal of contaminating viruses is highly reguired.<br>
Types of viruses include smallest viruses, such as<br>
parvovirus, with a diameter of about 18 to 24 run,<br>
medium-sized viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis<br>
virus, with a diameter of about 40 to 45 nm and<br>
relatively large viruses, such as HIV, with a diameter<br>
of about 80 to 100 nm, etc. In order to remove these<br>
virus groups physically by the membrane filtration<br>
method, a microporous membrane having a pore size of<br>
about 10 to 100 nm is required, and particularly the<br>
needs for removing small viruses such as parvovirus are<br>
increasing in recent years.<br>
In the meantime, when the membrane filtration<br>
method is applied in the refining process of a plasma<br>
derivative or a biopharmaceutical, it is desirable not<br>
only to enhance the virus removal ability but to allow<br>
rapid permeation of a large quantity of physiologically<br>
active substances in order to improve productivity.<br>
However,.when a subject to be removed is a<br>
small virus like parvovirus, since its size is<br>
extremely small, as small as 18 to 24 nm, it was<br>
difficult to satisfy both of the virus removal<br>
performance and the amount and rate of permeation of<br>
physiologically active substances by conventional<br>
technology.<br>
That is, conventional microporous membranes<br>
have drawbacks that they can allow permeation of high-<br>
molecular-weight physiologically active substances,<br>
such as human immunoglobulin and Factor VIII, at a<br>
sufficient permeation rate while they cannot remove<br>
small viruses such as parvovirus; or they can remove<br>
small viruses such as parvovirus while they cannot<br>
allow permeation of high-molecular-weight<br>
physiologically active substances, such as human<br>
immunoglobulin and Factor VIII, at a substantial<br>
permeation rate.<br>
International Publication WO91/16968 pamphlet<br>
discloses a process comprising immersing a membrane<br>
with a solution containing a polymerization initiator<br>
and a hydrophilic monomer, allowing polymerization<br>
within micropores, thereby adhering a hydrophilic resin<br>
to the surface of the micropores. This method,<br>
however, has a defect that the hydrophilic resin merely<br>
adheres to the surface of the micropores, and<br>
therefore, part of the adhering hydrophilic resin may<br>
be dissolved out upon washing out low-molecular weight<br>
substances generated in the reaction and hydrophilicity<br>
of the membrane may be easily lost. In addition, if a<br>
cross-linking agent is used in a large amount and<br>
copolymerization is performed in order to prevent<br>
dissolution-out, high permeability will not be attained<br>
for protein solutions.<br>
JP-A-07-265674 describes a polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride film having low adsorptivity for goat<br>
immunoglobulin which can effectively remove small<br>
particles from a solution. It is described that this<br>
film is useful for removing viruses from the solution.<br>
According to the Examples thereof, however, this<br>
hydrophilic film shows a low adsorptivity for goat<br>
immunoglobulin, and does not have sufficient<br>
permeability for physiologically active substances such<br>
as globulin comparable to the present invention.<br>
JP-A-62-179540 describes a hydrophilic hollow<br>
fiber porous membrane comprising a hydrophilic hollow<br>
fiber porous membrane composed of polyolefin and side<br>
chains containing a neutral hydroxyl group grafted to<br>
the membrane. The Examples thereof, however, only<br>
describe a hydrophilic microporous membrane having an<br>
average pore size of 0.1 to 0.16 jj.m and does not<br>
describe a small pore sized microporous membrane having<br>
a maximum pore size of 10 to 100 pm.<br>
JP-A-07-505830 describes a process which<br>
comprises irradiating hydrophobic microporous membrane<br>
of polyolefin or partially fluorinated polyolefin, etc.<br>
with ultraviolet ray and polymerizing a bifunctional<br>
monomer which has two reactive groups. According to<br>
the above-described method, however, hydrophilicity is<br>
lost due to cross-linking in hydrophilic diffusive<br>
layer and sufficient filtration rate cannot be attained<br>
for a protein solution.<br>
International Publication WO01/14047 pamphlet<br>
describes a filtration membrane for physiologically<br>
active substances wherein the logarithmic removing<br>
ratio for parvovirus is three or more and the<br>
permeation ratio for bovine immunoglobulin having a<br>
monomer ratio of 80% or more is 70% or more. However,<br>
the main membrane disclosed here comprises hollow<br>
fibers made of cellulose, and since the mechanical<br>
strength when it is wet with water is low, filtration<br>
pressure cannot be made high, and therefore, it is very<br>
difficult to achieve a high permeation rate.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a hydrophilic microporous membrane which has<br>
high removing ability for small viruses such as<br>
parvovirus, and allows permeation of physiologically<br>
active high-molecular-weight substances, such as<br>
globulin and Factor VIII, at a high rate and in large<br>

pore size (nm)2'75 (1)<br>
Globulin permeation rate B/globulin<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The maximum pore size of the hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention measured<br>
by the bubble point method is preferably 10 nm or more<br>
and more preferably 15 nm or more from the viewpoint of<br>
permeability of physiologically active substances such<br>
as globulin and filtration rate. The upper limit of<br>
the maximum pore size measured by the bubble point<br>
method is preferably 100 nm or less, and although it<br>
varies depending on the size of the virus and the like<br>
to be removed, it is preferably 70 nm or less for<br>
removing medium-sized viruses such as Japanese<br>
encephalitis virus, and particularly 36 nm or less when<br>
the object to be removed is a small virus such as<br>
parvovirus. The maximum pore size as used herein is<br>
the value measured by the bubble point method based on<br>
ASTM F316-86.<br>
It is preferable that a skin layer does not<br>
exist on the surface of the hydrophilic microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention. If a skin layer<br>
exists, suspending substances contained in the solution<br>
containing physiologically active substances such as<br>
protein accumulate on the membrane surface, and<br>
accordingly a rapid fall in the permeation capability<br>
may occur. The skin layer as used herein refers to a<br>
layer which exists adjacent to the membrane surface,<br>
and whose pore size is smaller compared with the inside<br>
of the membrane, and the thickness thereof is usually 1<br>
jam or less.<br>
The hydrophilic microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention has an average permeation rate<br>
(Iiter/m2/h) for 5 minutes from the start of filtration<br>
(hereinafter briefly referred to as globulin permeation<br>
rate A) when 3 wt% bovine immunoglobulin having a<br>
monomer ratio of 80 wt% or more is filtered at a<br>
constant pressure of 0.3 MPa which satisfies the<br>
following formula (1):<br>
Globulin permeation rate A &gt; 0.0015 x maximum<br>
pore size (nm) 2.75 (1) .<br>
That is, the globulin permeation rate A of<br>
the hydrophilic microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention should be more than 0.0015 x maximum pore<br>
size (nm)2.75, preferably not less than 0.0015 x maximum<br>
pore size (nm)2.80, more preferably not less than 0.0015<br>
x maximum pore size (nm)2"85, most preferably not less<br>
than 0.0015 x maximum pore size (nm}2"90. When the<br>
globulin permeation rate A is more than 0.0015 x<br>
maximum pore size (nm)2.75, sufficient permeation rate to<br>
carry out removing of viruses in the production of<br>
plasma derivatives, biopharmaceuticals, etc. on an<br>
industrial scale is securable.<br>
In addition, the hydrophilic microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention should have a<br>
globulin permeation rate A and an average permeation<br>
rate (Iiter/m2/h) for 5 minutes from the time point of<br>
55 minutes after the start of filtration (hereinafter<br>
briefly referred to as globulin permeation rate B) when<br>
3 wt% bovine immunoglobulin having a monomer ratio of<br>
80 wt% or more is filtered at a constant pressure of<br>
0.3 MPa which satisfies the following formula (2):<br>
Globulin-permeation rate B/globulin<br>
permeation rate A &gt; 0.2 (2).<br>
In the hydrophilic microporous membrane of<br>
the present invention, globulin permeation rate<br>
B/globulin permeation rate A (hereinafter briefly<br>
referred to as the ratio of filtration rates) is<br>
preferably 0.3 or more, and more preferably 0.4 or<br>
more. If the ratio of filtration rate is more than<br>
0.2, filtration rate can be kept sufficiently and<br>
removing of viruses in the production of plasma<br>
derivatives, biopharmaceuticals, etc. on an industrial<br><br>
scale is carried out.<br>
The hydrophilic microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention preferably has a logarithmic<br>
reduction value of porcine parvovirus at the time point<br>
by which 55 liter/m2 has been filtered from the start of<br>
filtration (hereinafter referred to as the 0 to 55<br>
liter/m2 filtered time) is 3 or more, and more<br>
preferably 3.5 or more, and most preferably 4 or more.<br>
When logarithmic reduction value of porcine parvovirus<br>
at the 0 to 55 liter/m2 filtered time is 3 or more, it<br>
can be equal to the use as a virus removal filter for<br>
removing small viruses such as human parvovirus B19 and<br>
poliomyelitis virus from a solution containing<br>
physiologically active substances. Furthermore, the<br>
fact that small viruses such as human parvovirus B19<br>
and poliomyelitis virus can be removed means that<br>
larger viruses such as hepatitis C and HIV can be:<br>
removed with still.higher probability.<br>
In addition, although a virus concentration<br>
in a filtrate may vary depending on a filtered volume,<br>
a membrane with no or a small, if any, decreasing ratio<br>
in the virus removal ability as the filtered volume<br>
increases is naturally desired. The hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention<br>
preferably has both of the logarithmic reduction value<br>
of porcine parvovirus at the time point by which 5<br>
liter/m2 has been filtered from the start of filtration<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the 0 to 5 liter/m2 filtered<br>
time) and the logarithmic reduction value of porcine<br>
parvovirus at the time point by which further 5 liter/m2<br>
has been filtered after 50 liter/m2 is filtered<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the 50 to 55 liter/m2<br>
filtered time) of 3 or more, and more preferably 3.5 or<br>
more, and most preferably 4 or more. The fact that<br>
each of the porcine parvovirus at 0 to 5 liter/m2<br>
filtered time and 50 to 55 liter/m2 filtered time is 3<br>
or more can be regarded as an index showing that<br>
persistency of the virus removal ability of the<br>
membrane is sufficiently high.<br>
Proteins in a plasma derivative or a<br>
biopharmaceutical are liable to be adsorbed to a<br>
hydrophobic membrane, in other words, they are hardly<br>
adsorbed to a hydrophilic membrane, and the<br>
hydrophilicity of the membrane can be estimated by<br>
contact angle of water. There are two methods for<br>
measuring contact angle, static contact angle method<br>
and dynamic contact angle method, and the dynamic<br>
contact angle method, which provides information on<br>
surface dynamics, is preferable. Among the dynamic<br>
contact angle methods, the measuring method according<br>
to the Wilhelmy method with high flexibility of sample<br>
form is more preferable.<br>
Among the contact angles of water, receding<br>
contact angle of water serves as an important index for<br>
estimating the hydrophilicity of the membrane, since<br>
the receding contact angle directly reflects the<br>
hydrophilicity of the membrane surface in water. The<br>
hydrophilic microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention preferably has a receding contact angle of<br>
water of 0 to 20 degrees, more preferably 0 to 15<br>
degrees, still more preferably 0 to 10 degrees and most<br>
preferably 0 to 5 degrees. When the receding contact<br>
angle of water exceeds 20 degrees, the hydrophilicity<br>
of the membrane is insufficient and a rapid fall of the<br>
filtration rate will be caused by adsorption of<br>
protein.<br>
Although the form of hydrophilic microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention is applicable in any<br>
form including a flat membrane, a hollow fiber, etc.,<br>
hollow fiber is preferable from the viewpoint of<br>
easiness of production.<br>
The membrane thickness of hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention is<br>
preferably 15 mm to 1000 mm, more preferably 15 mm to<br>
500 mm, and most preferably 20 mm to 100 mm. When the<br>
membrane thickness is 15 mm or more, not only strength<br>
of the microporous membrane is sufficient but also<br>
certainty in virus removal is sufficient. Membrane<br>
thickness exceeding 1000 mm is not preferable since the<br>
permeation capability tends to fall.<br>
The porosity of hydrophilic microporous<br>
membrane in the present invention is 20 to 90%,<br>
preferably 30 to 85%, and more preferably 40 to 80%.<br>
When the porosity is less than 20%, filtration rate is<br>
not enough and when the porosity exceeds 90%, there is<br>
a tendency that the certainty of virus removal<br>
decreases and the strength of microporous membrane<br>
becomes insufficient and therefore it is not<br>
preferable.<br>
Although water permeativity of the<br>
hydrophilic microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention varies depending on the pore size, it is<br>
preferably 2X10-11 to 3xl0-8, more preferably 4X10-11 to<br>
1.5xlO-8, most preferably 5xlO-11 to 8.5xlO-9. The unit<br>
of the water permeativity is m3/m2/second/Pa. When the<br>
water permeativity is 2xlCT-11 or more, water<br>
permeativity sufficient for use as a separation<br>
membrane can be obtained and therefore it is<br>
preferable. On the other hand, in consideration of<br>
keeping the strength of hydrophilic microporous<br>
membrane or securing the certainty of virus removal,<br>
water permeativity.exceeding 3xlO-8 is not realistic.<br>
The surface of the hydrophilic microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention and the surface of<br>
the micropores preferably show low adsorptivity for<br>
proteins such as globulin. The degree of adsorptivity<br>
can be evaluated by permeating a diluted solution of<br>
globulin which is a typical plasma protein, and<br>
quantifying the proteins contained in the unfiltered<br>
solution and the filtrate by absorption spectrometer.<br>
The amount of adsorption per 1 g of membrane when a<br>
bovine immunoglobulin solution diluted to 100 mass ppm<br>
is made to permeate is 3 mg or less, more preferably 2<br>
mg or less, and most preferably 1 mg or less.<br>
As for the hydrophilic microporous membrane<br>
of the present invention, it is preferable that the<br>
maximum pore size is 10 to 100 run and the structure of<br>
the microporous membrane is not limited as long as it<br>
satisfies the following formula (1) and formula (2).<br>
It is preferable, however, that the microporous<br>
membrane has a coarse structure layer with a higher<br>
open pore ratio and a fine structure layer with a lower<br>
open pore ratio, and the above-described coarse<br>
structure layer exists on at least one side of the<br>
membrane surface and has a thickness of 2 mm or more<br>
and the thickness of the above-described fine structure<br>
layer is 50% or more of the whole membrane thickness,<br>
and the above-described coarse structure layer and the<br>
above-described fine structure layer are formed in one<br>
piece. This is because such a structure facilitates to<br>
secure the initial filtration rate satisfying the<br>
formula (1) and to keep the filtration rate satisfying<br>
the formula (2).<br>
Globulin permeation rate A &gt; 0.0015 x maximum<br>
pore size (nm)2.75 (1)<br>
Globulin permeation rate B/globulin<br>
permeation rate A &gt; 0.2 (2).<br>
Microporous membranes having a preferable<br>
structure will be described below.<br>
In the above-described microporous membrane,<br>
the coarse structure layer preferably exists on at<br>
least one side of the membrane surface and the<br>
thickness of the coarse structure layer is preferably 2<br>
mm or more, more preferably 3 mm or more, still more<br>
preferably 5 mm or more and particularly preferably 8<br>
mm or more. The coarse structure layer has a pre-<br>
filter function, and alleviates decrease in the<br>
filtration rate due to the blockade by impurities. As<br>
the pore size of microporous membrane is smaller,<br>
impurities contained in physiologically active<br>
substances may more readily cause decrease in the<br>
filtration rate, and thus the thickness of the coarse<br>
structure layer is preferably large.<br>
In the meantime, the thickness of the fine<br>
structure layer is preferably 50% or more of the whole<br>
membrane thickness. When the thickness of the fine<br>
structure layer is 50% or more of the whole membrane<br>
thickness, it can be used without reducing removing<br>
performance such as for viruses. It is more preferably<br>
55% or more, and particularly preferably 60% or more.<br>
The above-described coarse structure layer is<br>
a part where open pore ratio is relatively large in the<br>
whole membrane thickness and improves processing<br>
performance of the membrane by exhibiting a pre-filter<br>
function on the suspending substances contained in a<br>
protein solution or the like. On the other hand, the<br>
above-described fine structure layer is a part where<br>
open pore ratio is relatively small in the whole<br>
membrane thickness and substantially defines the<br>
membrane pore size. It is the layer which has the<br>
function of removing particles in a microporous<br>
membrane to remove particles such as viruses.<br>
Both of the porosity and the open pore ratio<br>
respectively correspond to the capacity ratio of the<br>
pored portion in the microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention and they are the same in the basic<br>
concept but the porosity is a numerical value obtained<br>
from an apparent volume calculated from the cross-<br>
sectional area across the membrane and the length and<br>
the mass of the membrane and the true density of the<br>
membrane material, whereas the open pore ratio is an<br>
area ratio of the pored portions to the cross-sectional<br>
area of the membrane in the cross-section of the<br>
membrane, which can be determined from the image<br>
analysis of the electron microscope photograph of the<br>
cross-section of the membrane. In the present<br>
invention, open pore ratio is measured for every pre-<br>
determined thickness in the membrane thickness<br>
direction in order to investigate changes in the<br>
capacity ratio of the pored portions in the membrane<br>
thickness direction, and it is measured for every 1 mm<br>
thickness in consideration of measurement accuracy.<br>
Specifically, the open pore ratio is an<br>
average open pore ratio determined by dividing<br>
observation result of the cross-sectional structure in<br>
the direction perpendicular to the membrane surface of<br>
the microporous membrane for every 1 mm thickness in<br>
the thickness direction, determining the open pore<br>
ratio by image-processing analysis for each of the<br>
divided regions and averaging these open pore ratios<br>
for a predetermined membrane thickness region, and the<br>
average open pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness<br>
is a open pore ratio which is determined by averaging<br>
the open pore ratios obtained for each of the divided<br>
regions throughout the whole membrane thickness.<br>
In the present invention, the coarse<br>
structure layer is a layer with a higher open pore<br>
ratio which exists adjacent to the membrane surface,<br>
and preferably it is a layer in which (A) open pore<br>
ratio is the average open pore ratio of the whole<br>
membrane thickness + 2.0% or more (hereinafter referred<br>
to as the coarse structure layer of (A)), more<br>
preferably + 2.5% or more of layer, particularly<br>
preferably + 3.0% or more. The upper limit of the open<br>
pore ratio of the coarse structure layer is preferably<br>
the average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness + 30% or less, more preferably the average<br>
open pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness + 25%<br>
or less, particularly preferably the average open pore<br>
ratio of the whole membrane thickness + 20% or less.<br>
When the open pore ratio of the coarse structure layer<br>
is the average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness + 2.0% or more, the structural difference<br>
from the fine structure layer is also sufficiently<br>
large, which allows to exhibit pre-filtering effect and<br>
provides an effect of increasing the processing<br>
performance of the microporous membrane. On the other<br>
hand, when the open pore ratio of the coarse structure<br>
layer is more than the average open pore ratio of the<br>
whole membrane thickness + 30%, the structure of the<br>
coarse structure layer is unnecessarily coarse and may<br>
have only insufficient pre-filter function and<br>
therefore it is not preferable.<br>
Furthermore, the coarse structure layer<br>
preferably has a gradient structure where the open pore<br>
ratio decreases continuously from the membrane surface<br>
to the fine structure layer. The reason why this is<br>
preferable is that the pore size decreases continuously<br>
as the open pore ratio decreases continuously, thereby<br>
large suspending substances are removed near the<br>
surface and smaller suspending substances are gradually<br>
removed as going deeper into the inside and thus the<br>
pre-filter function of the coarse structure layer is<br>
improved. It is not preferable that the open pore<br>
ratio changes a lot discontinuously on the boundary<br>
between the coarse structure layer and the fine<br>
structure layer since the suspending substances<br>
accumulate near the boundary and cause decrease in the<br>
filtration rate. The gradient structure where the open<br>
pore ratio decreases continuously as used herein means<br>
an overall tendency in the membrane thickness<br>
direction, and there may be some local inversions of<br>
the open pore ratio resulting from structural variation<br>
or measurement errors.<br>
The coarse structure layer preferably<br>
contains a layer where the open pore ratio is the<br>
average open pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness<br>
+ 5.0% or more, and still more preferably contains a<br>
layer where the open pore ratio is the average open<br>
pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness + 8.0% or<br>
more. When the coarse structure layer contains a layer<br>
where the open pore ratio is the average open pore<br>
ratio of the whole membrane thickness + 5.0% or more,<br>
it means that the coarse structure layer has a layer<br>
having a sufficiently larger pore size than the fine<br>
structure layer, the coarse structure layer can exhibit<br>
sufficient pre-filter function. The layer which has<br>
the maximum open pore ratio is preferably present on<br>
the membrane surface or near the membrane surface.<br>
In addition, the average pore size on the<br>
surface of the membrane to which the coarse structure<br>
layer is adjacent in the microporous membrane is<br>
preferably twice more the maximum pore size determined<br>
by the bubble point method, and more preferably three<br>
times more the maximum pore size determined by the<br>
bubble point method. If the average pore size on the<br>
surface of the membrane to which the coarse structure<br>
layer is adjacent is below twice the maximum pore size<br>
determined by the bubble point method, the pore size is<br>
too small and there is a tendency that suspending<br>
substances deposit on the surface to cause decrease in<br>
the filtration rate, which is not preferable. When the<br>
microporous membrane is used for removing particles<br>
such as viruses, the average pore size on the surface<br>
of the membrane to which the coarse structure layer is<br>
adjacent is preferably 3 pm or less, more preferably 2<br>
fim or less. If the above-described average pore size<br>
exceeds 3 mm, there is a tendency that the pre-filter<br>
function deteriorates, which is not preferable.<br>
The fine structure layer is a layer with a<br>
lower open pore ratio, and preferably it is a layer in<br>
which (B) open pore ratio is less than the average open<br>
pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness + 2.0% and<br>
in the range of (the average value of the open pore<br>
ratio of the layer in which the open pore ratio is less<br>
than the average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness + 2.0%) ±2.0% (including both the ends)<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the fine structure layer of<br>
(B)). The fact that the open pore ratio of the fine<br>
structure layer is in the range of (the average value<br>
of the open pore ratio of the layer in which the open<br>
pore ratio is less than the average open pore ratio of<br>
the whole membrane thickness + 2.0%) ± 2.0% (including<br>
both the ends) means that the fine structure layer has<br>
a relatively homogeneous structure, and this is<br>
important for removing a virus or the like by depth<br>
filtration. The higher the homogeneity of the fine<br>
structure layer, the more preferable, and the range of<br>
variation of the open pore ratio is preferably within<br>
the range of ±2%, still more preferably within the<br>
range of ±1%. As an example of structure of the fine<br>
structure layer, the void structure in spherocrystal<br>
5 disclosed in the International Publication WO01/28667<br>
pamphlet can be preferably applied.<br>
An intermediate region belonging to neither<br>
the above-described coarse structure layer of (A) nor<br>
the fine structure layer of (B) may also exist in the<br>
10 microporous membrane. The intermediate region as used<br>
herein corresponds to a layer where the open pore ratio<br>
is less than the average open pore ratio of the whole<br>
membrane thickness + 2.0% but does not fall in the<br>
range of (the average value of the open pore ratio of<br>
15 the layer in which the open pore ratio is less than the<br>
average open pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness<br>
+ 2.0%) ± 2.0% (including both the ends). Such a layer<br>
usually exists in the boundary portions between the<br>
coarse structure layer of (A) and the fine structure<br>
20 layer of (B).<br>
As for the microporous membrane, it is<br>
preferable that the coarse structure layer and the fine<br>
structure layer are formed in one piece. The<br>
expression that the coarse structure layer and the fine<br>
25 structure layer are formed in one piece means that the<br>
coarse structure layer and the fine structure layer are<br>
simultaneously formed at the time of production of the<br>
microporous membrane. Under the present circumstances,<br>
an intermediate region may exist in the boundary<br>
portions between the coarse structure layer and the<br>
fine structure layer. As compared to a membrane<br>
produced by coating a comparatively small pore sized<br>
layer on the large pore sized support or a laminated<br>
membrane comprising laminated membranes having<br>
different pore sizes, it is more preferable that the<br>
coarse structure layer and the fine structure layer are<br>
formed in one piece. The membrane produced by coating<br>
and the laminated membrane comprising laminated<br>
membranes having different pore sizes, in which the<br>
connectivity of the pores becomes low or the pore size<br>
changes discontinuously a lot between two layers, have<br>
defects that suspending substances tend to deposit<br>
between the support and the coating layer.<br>
The process for producing a hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention will be<br>
described below.<br>
The thermoplastic resin used for producing a<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention is a<br>
thermoplastic resin having crystallizing properties<br>
which is used for usual compression, extrusion,<br>
ejection, inflation and blow moldings and polyolefin<br>
resins such as polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin<br>
and poly 4-methyl-l-pentene resin; polyester resins<br>
such as polyethylene terephthalate resin, polybutylene<br>
terephthalate resin, polyethylene terenaphthalate<br>
resin, polybutylene naphthalate resin,<br>
polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate resin;<br>
polyamide resins such as nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 610,<br>
nylon 612, nylon 11, nylon 12, and nylon 46; fluoride<br>
resins such as polyvinylidene fluoride resin,<br>
ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene resin and<br>
polychlorotrifluoroethylene resin; polyphenylene ether<br>
resins; and polyacetal resins, etc. can be used.<br>
Among the above-described thermoplastic<br>
resins, polyolefin resins and fluoride resins have good<br>
balance of heat resistance and molding processability<br>
and therefore they are preferable, and inter alia<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resins are particularly<br>
preferable. The polyvinylidene fluoride resin as used<br>
herein refers to a fluoride resin containing vinylidene<br>
fluoride units as a backbone structure, and is<br>
generally referred to by the abbreviated name of PVDF.<br>
As such a polyvinylidene fluoride resin, a homopolymer<br>
of vinylidene fluoride (VDF), a copolymer of one or two<br>
monomers selected from the monomer group consisting of<br>
hexafluoropropylene (HFP), pentafluoropropylene (PFP),<br>
tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), chlorotrifluoroethylene<br>
(CTFE) and perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (PFMVE) with<br>
vinylidene fluoride (VDF) can be used. The above-<br>
described homopolymer and the above-described copolymer<br>
can also be mixed and used. In the present invention,<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resin containing 30 to 100 wt%<br>
of a homopolymer is preferably used since the<br>
crystallinity of the microporous membrane will be<br>
improved and the strength thereof will become high, and<br>
it is still more preferable to use only homopolymer.<br>
The average molecular weight of the<br>
thermoplastic resin used in the present invention is<br>
preferably 50,000 to 5,000,000, more preferably 100,000<br>
to 2,000,000, still more preferably 150,000 to<br>
1,000,000. Although this average molecular weight<br>
indicates weight average molecular weight obtained by<br>
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement, since<br>
correct GPC measurement is generally difficult for a<br>
resin having an average molecular weight exceeding<br>
1,000,000, viscosity average molecular weight by the<br>
viscosity method can be adopted instead thereof. If<br>
the weight average molecular weight is smaller than<br>
50,000, the melt tension during melt molding becomes<br>
small, with the result that shapability will be<br>
deteriorated or the membranous mechanical strength will<br>
become low, and therefore it is not preferable. If the<br>
weight average molecular weight exceeds 5,000,000,<br>
uniform melt-blending becomes difficult, and therefore<br>
it is not preferable.<br>
The polymer concentration of the<br>
thermoplastic resin used in the present invention is<br>
preferably 20 to 90 wt%, more preferably 30 to 80 wt%,<br>
and most preferably 35 to 70 wt% in the composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer. If<br>
the polymer concentration becomes less than 20 wt%,<br>
problems will occur, for example, membrane forming<br>
properties are deteriorated and sufficient mechanical<br>
strength cannot be obtained. In addition, pore size of<br>
the microporous membrane obtained becomes too large as<br>
a membrane for removing viruses, and the virus removal<br>
performance becomes insufficient. If the polymer<br>
concentration exceeds 90 wt%, the porosity becomes<br>
small while the pore size of microporous membrane<br>
obtained becomes too small, and therefore the<br>
filtration rate decreases and the membrane cannot be<br>
used practically.<br>
As a plasticizer used in the present<br>
invention, a non-volatile solvent which can form a<br>
uniform solution at a temperature not less than the<br>
melting point of the crystal of a thermoplastic resin<br>
when the plasticizer is mixed with the thermoplastic<br>
resin with a composition for producing a microporous<br>
membrane is used. The non-volatile solvent here has a<br>
boiling point of 250°C or more under atmospheric<br>
pressure. The form of a plasticizer may be a liquid or<br>
a solid generally at a normal temperature of 20°C. It<br>
is preferable to use a plasticizer of so-called solid-<br>
liquid phase separation system for producing a membrane<br>
which has a small pore sized and homogeneous fine<br>
structure layer to be used for virus removal, which<br>
plasticizer has a thermally induced solid-liquid phase<br>
separation point at a temperature not lower than normal<br>
temperature when a uniform solution with thermoplastic<br>
resin is cooled. Some plasticizers have a thermally<br>
induced liquid-liquid phase separation point at a<br>
temperature not lower than normal temperature when a<br>
uniform solution with a thermoplastic resin is cooled<br>
but generally the use of a plasticizer of liquid-liquid<br>
phase separation system tends to form obtained<br>
microporous membrane in large pore sizes. The<br>
plasticizer used here may be a single substance or a<br>
mixture of two or more substances.<br>
The method for measuring a thermally induced<br>
solid-liquid phase separation point may comprise using<br>
as a sample a composition containing a thermoplastic<br>
resin and a plasticizer of the predetermined<br>
concentration and melt-blended beforehand, and<br>
measuring the exothermic peak temperature of this resin<br>
by thermal analysis (DSC). The method of measuring the<br>
crystallizing point of this resin may also comprise<br>
using as a sample the resin melt-blended beforehand,<br>
and conducting thermal analysis in a similar manner.<br>
As a plasticizer used preferably for the<br>
production of a membrane which has a small pore sized<br>
and homogeneous fine structure layer and is used for<br>
virus removal, a plasticizer disclosed in International<br>
Publication WO01/28667 pamphlet can be mentioned. That<br>
is, a plasticizer for which a depression constant of<br>
the phase separation point of the composition defined<br>
by the following formula is 0 to 40°C, preferably 1 to<br>
35°C, still more preferably 5 to 30°C can be mentioned.<br>
If the depression constant of the phase separation<br>
point exceeds 40°C, homogeneity of the pore size and<br>
strength are deteriorated and therefore such a<br>
plasticizer is not preferable.<br>
a = 100 x (Tc° - Tc)/(100 - C)<br>
wherein a represents a depression constant of the phase<br>
separation point (°C), Tc° represents a crystallizing<br>
temperature (°C) of the thermoplastic resin, Tc<br>
represents a thermally induced solid-liquid phase<br>
separation point (°C) of the composition and C<br>
represents a concentration (wt%) of the thermoplastic<br>
resin in the composition.<br>
For example, when polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
resin is selected as a thermoplastic resin,<br>
dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), diamyl phthalate(DAP),<br>
triphenyl phosphate (TPP), diphenylcresyl phosphate<br>
(CDP), tricresyl phosphate (TCP), etc. are particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
In the present invention, the first method<br>
for carrying out uniform dissolution of the composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer is a<br>
method comprising feeding the resin into a continuous<br>
resin blending machine such as an extruder, introducing<br>
a plasticizer in an arbitrary ratio while heat melting<br>
the resin and carrying out screw blending to obtain a<br>
uniform solution. The form of the resin to be fed may<br>
be in any shape of a powder, a granule and a pellet.<br>
When carrying out the uniform dissolution by this<br>
method, the form of the plasticizer is preferably a<br>
liquid at a normal temperature. As an extruder, a<br>
single axis screw extruder, two-axis opposite direction<br>
screw extruder, two-axis same direction screw extruder,<br>
etc. can be used.<br>
The second method of carrying out uniform<br>
dissolution of the composition containing a<br>
thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer is a method<br>
comprising mixing and dispersing a plasticizer in a<br>
resin beforehand using a churning equipment such as a<br>
Henschel mixer and feeding the resultant composition<br>
into a continuous resin blending machine such as an<br>
extruder and carrying out melt-blending to obtain a<br>
uniform solution. The form of the composition to be<br>
fed may be in a shape of slurry when the plasticizer is<br>
a liquid at normal temperature, and in a shape of a<br>
powder, a granule or the like when the plasticizer is a<br>
solid at normal temperature.<br>
The third method of carrying out uniform<br>
dissolution of the composition containing a<br>
thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer is a method of<br>
using a simple form resin blending machine such as a<br>
brabender and a mill, and a method of melt-blending<br>
within a blending container of the other batch type.<br>
According to these methods, it cannot be said that<br>
productivity is good since they are batch type<br>
processes, but there is an advantage that they are<br>
simple and highly flexible.<br>
In the present invention, after the<br>
composition containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer is heated to a temperature not lower than<br>
the melting point of the crystal of the thermoplastic<br>
resin to form a uniform solution, the composition is<br>
extruded in the form of a flat membrane or a hollow<br>
fiber from a discharging orifice such as a T-die, a<br>
circular die and an annular spinneret, and cooled to<br>
solidification to shape a membrane form (step (a)). In<br>
the step (a) in which the composition is cooled to<br>
solidification to shape a membrane form, the fine<br>
structure layer is formed while the coarse structure<br>
layer is formed adjacent to the membrane surface.<br>
In the present invention, the composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer<br>
which is heated and uniformly dissolved is discharged<br>
from a discharging orifice and the membrane is taken<br>
over at a taking-over rate so that the draft ratio<br>
defined below may be not less than 1 and not more than<br>
12, while a non-volatile liquid heated to 100°C or more<br>
which is capable of partially solubilizing the<br>
thermoplastic resin is contacted with one membrane;<br>
surface and the other side of the membrane is cooled to<br>
form a coarse structure layer and a fine structure<br>
layer.<br>
Draft ratio = (membrane taking-over<br>
rate)/(discharging rate of the composition at the<br>
discharging orifice)<br>
The above-described draft ratio is preferably<br>
not less than 1.5 and not more than 9, more preferably<br>
not less than 1.5 and not more than 7. If the draft<br>
ratio is less than 1, no tension is loaded on the<br>
membrane and the shapability is poor and if it exceeds<br>
12, the membrane is extended and therefore it is<br>
difficult to form a coarse structure layer having a<br>
sufficient thickness. The discharging rate of the<br>
composition at the discharging orifice as used herein<br>
is given by the following formula:<br>
Discharging rate of the composition at the<br>
discharging orifice = (volume of composition discharged<br>
per unit time)/(area of discharging orifice)<br>
The preferable range of the discharging rate<br>
is 1 to 60 m/min, more preferably 3 to 40 m/min. When<br>
the discharging rate is less than 1 m/min, problems<br>
occur such as increase in fluctuation of the<br>
discharging volume in addition to decrease in<br>
productivity. On the contrary, if the discharging rate<br>
exceeds 60 m/min, since there is much discharging<br>
volume, a turbulent flow may occur at the discharging<br>
orifice, and the discharging state may become unstable.<br>
Although the taking-over rate can be set<br>
according to the discharging rate, it is preferably 1<br>
to 200 m/min, more preferably 3 to 150 m/min. If the<br>
taking-over rate is less than 1 m/min, productivity and<br>
shapability are deteriorated, and if the taking-over<br>
rate exceeds 200 m/min, cooling time becomes short,<br>
tension loaded on the membrane increases and<br>
accordingly rupture of the membrane tends to occur.<br>
A preferable method of forming a coarse<br>
structure layer is a method in which one side of the<br>
surfaces of uncured membrane formed by extruding the<br>
composition containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer from the extruding orifice into a membrane<br>
of the shape of a flat membrane or a hollow fiber is<br>
contacted with a non-volatile liquid which is capable<br>
of partially solubilizing the thermoplastic resin., In<br>
this case, a coarse structure layer is formed by<br>
diffusion of the contacted liquid inside the membrane<br>
and a partial dissolution of the thermoplastic resin.<br>
The liquid which is capable of partially solubilizing<br>
the thermoplastic resin as used herein is a liquid<br>
which cannot form a uniform solution unless the<br>
temperature is elevated to 100°C or more when it is<br>
mixed with the thermoplastic resin in 50 wt%<br>
concentration, and.preferably it is a liquid which can<br>
form a uniform solution at a temperature not lower than<br>
100°C and not higher than 250°C, and more preferably it<br>
is a liquid which can form a uniform solution at a<br>
temperature not lower than 120°C and not higher than<br>
200°C. If the liquid which can achieve uniform<br>
dissolution at a temperature lower than 100°C is used as<br>
a contact liquid, cooling solidification of the<br>
composition solution containing a thermoplastic resin<br>
and a plasticizer is prevented, and consequently<br>
problems may occur, for example, shapability may be<br>
deteriorated, the coarse structure layer may become<br>
unnecessarily thick, or the pore size becomes<br>
excessively large. In the case of the liquid which<br>
cannot form a uniform solution at a temperature lower<br>
than 250°C, the solubility of the thermoplastic resin is<br>
too low, and it is difficult to form a coarse structure<br>
layer having a sufficient thickness. The non-volatile<br>
liquid as used herein is a liquid having a boiling<br>
point exceeding 250°C under 101325Pa.<br>
For example, when polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
resin is selected as a thermoplastic resin, phthalic<br>
acid esters, adipic acid esters and sebacic acid esters<br>
in which the carbon chain length of the ester chain is<br>
seven or less, phosphoric acid esters and citric acid<br>
esters in which the carbon chain length of the ester<br>
chain is eight or less can be preferably used, and.<br>
particularly, diheptyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,<br>
diethyl phthalate,.dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl adipate,<br>
dibutyl sebacate, tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, tributyl<br>
phosphate, acetyltributyl citrate, etc. can be used<br>
suitably.<br>
However, plasticizers having an annular<br>
structure such as a phenyl group, a cresyl group, a<br>
cyclohexyl group, etc. in the ester chain, i.e.,<br>
dicyclohexyl phthalate, (DCHP), diamyl phthalate(DAP),<br>
triphenyl phosphate (TPP), diphenylcresyl phosphate<br>
(CDP), tricresyl phosphate (TCP), etc. do have<br>
exceptionally poor capability to form a coarse<br><br>
structure layer and they are not preferable.<br>
The temperature of the contacting liquid used<br>
to introduce a coarse structure layer is a temperature<br>
not lower than 100°C, preferably not lower than 120°C,<br>
and not higher than the temperature of the uniform<br>
solution of a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer,<br>
still more preferably a temperature not lower than<br>
130°C, and not higher than (the temperature of the<br>
uniform solution of a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer - 10°C). If the temperature of the<br>
contacting liquid is lower than 100°C, the solubility of<br>
the thermoplastic resin is too low, and therefore it<br>
tends to be difficult to form a coarse structure layer<br>
having a sufficient thickness. If the temperature<br>
exceeds the temperature of the uniform solution of the<br>
thermoplastic resin and the plasticizer, shapability is<br>
deteriorated.<br>
When a coarse structure layer is introduced<br>
only on one side of the microporous membrane, the<br>
cooling method of the surface of the other side<br>
corresponding to the fine structure layer side can<br>
follow any conventional method. That is, it can be<br>
carried out by contacting a heat conducting object to<br>
effect cooling. As the heat conducting object, metal,<br>
water, air, or the plasticizer itself can be used.<br>
Specifically, a method of introducing a coarse<br>
structure layer is possible which comprises extruding a<br>
uniform solution containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer in the shape of a sheet through a T-die<br>
etc., carrying out contact cooling with a metal roll,<br>
and bringing the other side of the membrane which does<br>
not contact with the roll into contact with a non-<br>
volatile liquid which is capable of partially<br>
solubilizing the thermoplastic resin. Alternatively a<br>
method is possible which comprises extruding a uniform<br>
solution containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer in the shape of a cylinder or a hollow<br>
fiber through a circular die, annular spinneret, etc.,<br>
and passing a non-volatile liquid which is capable of<br>
partially solubilizing the thermoplastic resin through<br>
inside the cylinder or hollow fiber to form a coarse<br>
structure layer in the inner surface side while<br>
contacting the outside with a cooling media such as<br>
water to effect cooling.<br>
When the coarse structure layer is introduced<br>
on both the sides of the microporous membrane, a<br>
uniform solution containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer is extruded in a predetermined shape<br>
through a T-die, a circular die, annular spinneret,,<br>
etc., a circular die, annular spinneret, and the<br>
solution is contacted with a non-volatile liquid which<br>
is capable of partially solubilizing the thermoplastic<br>
resin on both the sides to form a coarse structure<br>
layer, which is then cooled to solidification. Cooling<br>
method in this process can follow any conventional<br>
method. When the time after contacting the non-<br>
volatile liquid which is capable of partially<br>
solubilizing the thermoplastic resin until the cooling<br>
starts is too long, problems may occur, for example,<br>
shapability may be deteriorated, the strength of the<br>
membrane is deteriorated, etc., and therefore the time<br>
period after contacting the contacting liquid till the<br>
start of the cooling is preferably 30 seconds or less,<br>
more preferably 20 seconds or less, and particularly<br>
preferably 10 seconds or less.<br>
In the production method of the microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention, in order to form a<br>
small pore sized and homogeneous fine structure layer,<br>
it is preferable to make the cooling rate at the time<br>
of effecting cooling solidification sufficiently high.<br>
The cooling rate is preferably 50°C/min or more, more<br>
preferably 100 to 1x105 °C/min, still more preferably<br>
200 to 2x104 °C/min. Specifically, the method of<br>
contacting with a metal cooling roll and water is<br>
preferably used, and particularly, the method of<br>
contacting with water is preferable since it can attain<br>
rapid cooling by evaporation of water.<br>
In the step (b) which removes the substantial<br>
portion of the plasticizer, in order to remove a<br>
plasticizer, an extracting solvent is used. It is<br>
preferable that the extracting solvent is a poor<br>
solvent for the thermoplastic resin and is a good<br>
solvent for the plasticizer, and the boiling point<br>
thereof is lower than the melting point of microporous<br>
membrane. Examples of such an extracting solvent<br>
include hydrocarbons such as hexane and cyclohexane;<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and<br>
1,1,1-trichloroethane; alcohols such as ethanol and<br>
isopropanol; ethers such as diethyl ether and<br>
tetrahydrofuran; ketones such as acetone and 2-<br>
butanone; or water.<br>
In the present invention, the first method of<br>
removing a plasticizer is performed by immersing and<br>
fully washing the microporous membrane cut off in the<br>
predetermined size in a container containing an<br>
extracting solvent and making the adhering solvent air-<br>
dried or dried by hot air. Under the present<br>
circumstances, the immersing and washing operations are<br>
preferably repeated many times since the plasticizer<br>
remaining in the microporous membrane will decrease<br>
accordingly. It is preferable to constrain the ends of<br>
the microporous membrane, which suppresses contraction<br>
of the microporous membrane during a series of<br>
operations of immersion, washing and drying.<br>
The second method of removing a plasticizer<br>
comprises continuously feeding the microporous membrane<br>
into a bath filled with an extracting solvent,<br>
immersing the membrane in the tub over sufficient time<br>
to remove a plasticizer, and then drying the solvent<br>
adhered to the membrane. Under the present<br>
circumstances, it is preferable to apply well-known<br>
techniques such as a multi-stage method in which the<br>
inside of the tub is divided into plural stages and the<br>
microporous membranes are fed one by one into each tub<br>
having different concentrations, or a counter-flow<br>
method in which the extracting solvent is supplied in<br>
the direction opposite to the running direction of the<br>
microporous membrane, and thereby a concentration<br>
gradation is provided, in order to enhance extraction<br>
efficiency. It is important that a plasticizer is<br>
removed from the microporous membrane substantially in<br>
either of the first and second methods. Removing<br>
substantially means that the plasticizer in the<br>
microporous membrane is removed to an extent which does<br>
not spoil the performance as a separation membrane and<br>
the amount of the plasticizer remaining in the<br>
microporous membrane is preferably 1 wt% or less, more<br>
preferably 100 mass ppm or less. The quantification of<br>
the amount of the plasticizer which remains in the<br>
microporous membrane can be carried out by gas<br>
chromatography, liquid chromatography, etc. It is<br>
further preferable to raise the temperature of the<br>
extracting solvent to a temperature lower than the<br>
boiling point of the solvent, preferably in the range<br>
of not higher than (the boiling point - 5°C) , since the<br>
diffusion of the plasticizer and the solvent can be<br>
promoted, and the extraction efficiency is improved.<br>
In the present invention, the microporous<br>
membrane may be heat-treated before, or after, or both<br>
before and after the step for removing a plasticizer,<br>
which provides effects such as reduction of contraction<br>
of the microporous membrane at the time of removing a<br>
plasticizer, improvement in the strength and<br>
improvement in heat resistance of the microporous<br>
membrane. There are some methods of performing heat-<br>
treatment such as a method of disposing the microporous<br>
membrane in a hot air, a method of immersing the<br>
microporous membrane in a heat medium, or a method of<br>
contacting the microporous membrane with a metal roll<br>
which has been heated and heat-controlled. When the<br>
size is fixed and the membrane is heat-treated,<br>
particularly, blockades of minute holes can be<br>
prevented and therefore such a method is preferable.<br>
Although the temperature of heat-treatment<br>
varies depending on the purpose and the melting point<br>
of the thermoplastic resin, in the case of the<br>
vinylidene fluoride membrane used for a virus removal,<br>
121 to 175°C is preferable, more preferably 125 to<br>
170°C. The temperature 121°C is used by general high-<br>
pressure steamy sterilization, and the contraction and<br>
modification during high-pressure steamy sterilization<br>
can be prevented if heat-treatment is conducted at this<br>
temperature or higher. If the temperature exceeds<br>
175°C, which is close to the melting point of vinylidene<br>
fluoride, disadvantages may occur, for example, the<br>
membrane may be ruptured or minute pores may be closed<br>
during the heat-treatment.<br>
The microporous membrane which consists of a<br>
hydrophobic resin excellent in physical strength is<br>
excellent in that it can be endured against high<br>
filtration pressure as compared with a microporous<br>
membrane which consists of hydrophilic resin such as<br>
cellulose while the former tends to cause adsorption of<br>
a protein or the like, contamination and clogging of<br>
the membrane, etc., resulting in a rapid fall of<br>
filtration rate. Therefore, when a microporous<br>
membrane which consists of a hydrophobic resin is used,<br>
it is preferable to impart the membrane with<br>
hydrophilicity in order to prevent blockade due to the<br>
adsorption of protein, etc. In the production method<br>
of the present invention, it is preferable to introduce<br>
a hydrophilic functional group into the surface of the<br>
pores of the hydrophobic membrane by graft<br>
polymerization method, and to reduce adsorptivity such<br>
as that of protein.<br>
The graft polymerization method is a reaction<br>
in which radicals are generated on the polymer<br>
microporous membrane by means such as ionizing<br>
radiation and chemical reaction and a monomer is graft<br>
polymerized onto the membrane using the radical as a<br>
starting point.<br>
In the present invention, although any means<br>
can be adopted in order to generate radicals on the<br>
polymer microporous membrane, but in order to generate<br>
radicals uniformly over the whole membrane, irradiation<br>
of ionizing radiation is preferable. As a kind of<br>
ionizing radiation, y-ray, electron beam, p-ray, neutron<br>
beam, etc. can be used, but electron beam or y-ray is<br>
most preferable in the implementation on an industrial<br>
scale. Ionizing radiation can be obtained from<br>
radioactive isotopes such as cobalt 60, strontium 90,<br>
and cesium 137, or by X-ray photography equipment,<br>
electron beam accelerator, ultraviolet ray irradiation<br>
equipment, etc.<br>
The irradiation dose of the ionizing<br>
radiation is preferably not less than 1 kGy and not<br>
more than 1000 kGy, more preferably not less than 2 kGy<br>
and not more than 500 kGy, most preferably not less<br>
than 5 kGy and not more than 200 kGy. Radicals are not<br>
generated uniformly below 1 kGy while the strength of<br>
the membrane may be deteriorated over 1000 kGy.<br>
The graft polymerization method by<br>
irradiation of ionizing radiation is generally roughly<br>
divided into a pre-irradiation method in which radicals<br>
are generated in the membrane and subsequently the<br>
membrane is contacted to the reactant compounds and a<br>
simultaneous irradiation method in which radicals are<br>
generated in the membrane while the membrane is<br>
contacted to the reactant compounds. In the present<br>
invention, any method can be applied, but the pre-<br>
irradiation method is preferable since it generates<br>
less amount of oligomers.<br>
A hydrophilic vinyl monomer which has one<br>
vinyl group as a reactant compound, and a cross-linking<br>
agent used if needed are made to contact with a polymer<br>
microporous membrane in which radicals have been<br>
generated in the present invention. Although the<br>
method of carrying out contact can be performed also<br>
either on a gaseous phase or a liquid phase, the method<br>
of carrying out contact in a liquid phase in which a<br>
graft reaction progresses uniformly is preferable. For<br>
the purpose of making the graft reaction still more<br>
uniformly, it is preferable that a hydrophilic vinyl<br>
monomer which has one vinyl group or a hydrophilic<br>
vinyl monomer and a cross-linking agent when a cross-<br>
linking agent is used are dissolved in a solvent<br>
beforehand and then the contact with a polymei:<br>
microporous membrane is carried out.<br>
As described above, the hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention comprises<br>
a polymer microporous membrane on which a hydrophilic<br>
vinyl monomer having one vinyl group is graft<br>
polymerized to impart the surface of the micropores<br>
with hydrophilicity thereby reducing adsorption of<br>
physiologically active substances such as protein. The<br>
hydrophilic vinyl monomer which has one vinyl group in<br>
the present invention is a monomer which has one vinyl<br>
group and uniformly dissolves in a pure water of 25°C<br>
when mixed therein at 1 vol% under atmospheric<br>
pressure. Examples of the hydrophilic vinyl monomer<br>
include vinyl monomers having a hydroxyl group or a.<br>
functional group used as a precursor thereof such as<br>
hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate; vinyl<br>
monomers having an amide bond such as vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone; vinyl monomers having an amino group such<br>
as acrylics amide; vinyl monomers having a<br>
polyethyleneglycol chain such as polyethyleneglycol<br>
monoacrylate; vinyl monomers having an anion exchange<br>
groups such as triethylammoniumethyl methacrylate;<br>
vinyl monomers having a cation exchange groups such as<br>
sulfopropyl methacrylate,<br>
In the present invention, among the<br>
hydrophilic vinyl monomers, the above-described<br>
hydrophilic vinyl monomer which has one or more<br>
hydroxyl group or a functional group used as a<br>
precursor thereof is preferably used since the use<br>
thereof reduces a receding contact angle of the<br>
membrane. More preferably, esters of acrylic acid or<br>
methacrylic acid and a polyhydric alcohol such as<br>
hydroxypropyl acrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate;<br>
alcohols having an unsaturated bond such as allyl<br>
alcohol; and enol esters such as vinyl acetate and<br>
vinyl propionate are used and most preferably esters of<br>
acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and a polyhydric<br>
alcohol such as hydroxypropyl acrylate and 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate are used. The hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane to which hydroxypropyl acrylate is<br>
grafted has a low receding contact angle and provides a<br>
sufficient globulin permeating ability.<br>
A vinyl monomer which has two or more vinyl<br>
groups has a tendency to perform cross-linking in the<br>
hydrophilic diffusive layer through copolymerization<br>
and reduce the permeability of protein even if it is<br>
hydrophilic, and accordingly it is not preferable from<br>
the viewpoint of protein permeativity, but it is<br>
possible to use such a monomer if needed as a cross-<br>
linking agent since it has an effect of preventing<br>
adherence between membranes and reducing dissolution-<br>
out from the membrane.<br>
The vinyl monomer which has two or more vinyl<br>
groups used as a cross-linking agent is advantageous<br>
when the receding contact angle is lower taking into<br>
consideration the adsorptivity of the micropore<br>
surfaces for protein and therefore it is preferable to<br>
use a hydrophilic cross-linking agent. The hydrophilic<br>
cross-linking agent is a monomer which has two or more<br>
vinyl groups and uniformly dissolves in a pure water of<br>
25°C when mixed therein at 1 vol% under atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
When such a cross-linking agent, i.e., vinyl<br>
monomer which has two or more vinyl groups is used, it<br>
is copolymerized at a proportion to the hydrophilic<br>
vinyl monomer which has one vinyl group of preferably<br>
10 mol% or less, more preferably 0.01 to 10 mol%,<br>
further preferably 0.01 to 7 mol% and most preferably<br>
0.01 to 5 mol%. The permeability of protein is not<br>
enough if it exceeds 10 rnol%.<br>
The cross-linking agent used in the present<br>
invention has preferably a number average molecular<br>
weight of 200 or more and 2000 or less, more preferably<br>
a number average molecular weight of 250 or more and<br>
1000 or less, most preferably a number average<br>
molecular weight of 300 or more and 600 or less. It is<br>
preferable from the viewpoint of the filtration rate of<br>
a protein solution that the number average molecular<br>
weight of the cross-linking agent is 200 or more and<br>
2000 or less.<br>
Specific examples of the cross-linking agent<br>
used in the present invention, i.e., the vinyl monomer<br>
which has two or more vinyl groups, include, for<br>
example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene<br>
glycol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate,<br>
polyethylene glycol diacrylate, etc., and as other<br>
vinyl monomer which has two or more vinyl groups,<br>
cross-linking agents having three reactive groups such<br>
as divinylbenzene derivatives and trimethylolpropane<br>
trimethacrylate can also be used. Although these<br>
cross-linking agents can also be used as a mixture of<br>
two or more kinds of compounds, it is preferable that<br>
they are hydrophilic. Polyethylene glycol diacrylate is<br>
particularly preferable from the viewpoint of the<br>
receding contact angle or protein permeativity.<br>
A solvent which dissolves the hydrophilic<br>
vinyl monomer which has one vinyl group, and the cross-<br>
linking agent used if needed is not particularly<br>
limited as long as the uniform dissolution can be<br>
carried out. Examples of such a solvent include<br>
alcohols such as ethanol, and isopropanol, t-butyl<br>
alcohol; ethers such as diethyl ether and<br>
tetrahydrofuran; and ketones such as acetone and 2-<br>
butanone; water or a mixture thereof.<br>
The concentration of a hydrophilic vinyl<br>
monomer which has one vinyl group, and the cross-<br>
linking agent used if needed at the time of dissolving<br>
them is preferably from 3 vol% to 30 vol%, more<br>
preferably from 3 vol% to 20 vol%, most preferably from<br>
3 vol% to 15 vol%. When it is a concentration not less<br>
than 3 vol%, sufficient hydrophilicity can be obtained<br>
and such a concentration is preferable. If it exceeds<br>
30 vol%, the micropores may be filled with the<br>
hydrophilized layer and there is a tendency that<br>
permeation capability is deteriorated and therefore<br>
such a concentration is not preferable.<br>
The amount of the reaction liquid in which<br>
the hydrophilic vinyl monomer which has one vinyl group<br>
and the cross-linking agent used if needed are<br>
dissolved in a solvent used at the time of graft<br>
polymerization is preferably 1x10-5 m3 to 1x10-3 m3 per 1<br>
g of the polymer microporous membrane. If the amount<br>
of the reaction liquid is 1x10-5 m3 to 1x10-3 m3,<br>
membranes with enough homogeneity can be obtained.<br>
The reaction temperature at the time of graft<br>
polymerization is not particularly limited, although<br>
generally carried out at 20°C to 80°C.<br>
The present invention introduces the optimal<br>
hydrophilized layer to a hydrophobic microporous<br>
membrane, and realizes high protein permeativity. The<br>
ratio of the graft grafted to the hydrophobic<br>
microporous membrane for this purpose is preferably 3%<br>
or more and 50% or less, more preferably 4% or more and<br>
40% or less, and most preferably 6% or more and 30% or<br>
less. If the graft ratio is less than 3%,<br>
hydrophilicity of the membrane runs short and a rapid<br>
fall in the filtration rate resulting from adsorption<br>
of protein is caused. If it exceeds 50%, relatively<br>
small pores will be filled with the hydrophilized layer<br>
and sufficient filtration rate cannot be obtained. The<br>
graft ratio as used herein is a value defined by the<br>
following formula:<br>
Graft ratio (%) = 100 x ((membrane mass after<br>
grafted - membrane mass before grafted)/membrane mass<br>
before grafted)<br>
To the composition which constitutes the<br>
hydrophilic microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention may be further blended, according to the<br>
purpose, additives such as anti-oxidant, crystal core<br>
agent, antistatic agent, flame retardant, lubricant,<br>
and ultraviolet ray absorbent if necessary.<br>
The hydrophilic microporous membrane which<br>
has a heat resistance of the present invention can be<br>
used for a wide range of applications including a<br>
separation membrane for medical use such as for<br>
removing, concentrating or as a culture medium of a<br>
virus, bacterium, etc., a filter for industrial<br>
processes which removes particles from a pharmaceutical<br>
liquid or processed water, etc., a separation membrane<br>
for oil-water separation or liquid-gas separation, a<br>
separation membrane aiming at purification of city<br>
water and sewerage, and a separator for lithium ion<br>
battery, and a support for solid electrolyte polymer<br>
batteries.<br>
Hereafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in detail by way of Examples but the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto. The testing methods<br>
shown in Examples are as follows.<br>
(1) Outer diameter, inner diameter of hollow fiber,<br>
thickness of membrane<br>
The outer diameter, inner diameter of a<br>
hollow fiber is determined by photographing the<br>
perpendicular section of the membrane at 210 times<br>
magnification using a substance microscope<br>
(SCOPEMAN503, product of Moriteq Co., Ltd.). The<br>
thickness of the membrane was calculated as 1/2 of the<br>
difference of the outer diameter and the inner diameter<br>
of a hollow fiber.<br>
(2) Porosity<br>
The volume and mass of the microporous<br>
membrane were measured and the void ratio was<br>
calculated using the following formula from the<br>
obtained results.<br>
Porosity (%) = (1 - mass/(density x volume of<br>
resin)) x 100<br>
(3) Water permeativity<br>
The volume of permeated pure water at 2 5°C was<br>
measured by constant-pressure dead-end filtration and<br>
the water permeativity was calculated as the following<br>
formula from the area of the membrane, filtration<br>
pressure (0.1 MPa) and filtration time.<br>
Water permeativity (m3/m2/second/Pa) =<br>
permeation volume/(area of membrane x differential<br>
pressure x filtration time)<br>
(4) Maximum pore size<br>
The bubble point (Pa) which can be determined<br>
by the bubble point method based on ASTM F 316-8 6 was<br>
converted to the maximum pore size (run) . As a testing<br>
liquid in which the membrane is immersed, a<br>
fluorocarbon liquid having a surface tension of 12 mN/m<br>
(Perfluorocarbon coolant FX-3250 (trademark), product<br>
of Sumitomo 3M) was used. The bubble point was<br>
determined by setting a hollow fiber having an<br>
effective length of 8 cm in a bubble point measurement<br>
equipment, gradually raising the pressure of the hollow<br>
side and reading the pressure when the gas flow rate<br>
permeating the membrane reaches 2.4 E-3 liter/min.<br>
(5) Structure observation of microporous membrane<br>
The microporous membrane cut off in a<br>
suitable size was fixed onto the sample stand with a<br>
conductive double-sided tape, and coated with gold to<br>
prepare a sample for microscopic observation. A high<br>
resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM) (S-900,<br>
product of Hitachi, Ltd.) was used and structure<br>
observation of the surface and a section of the<br>
microporous membrane was performed at an acceleration<br>
voltage of 5.0 kV and predetermined magnification.<br>
(6) Open pore ratio and average open pore ratio<br>
The open pore ratio was determined by<br>
dividing the observation result of the cross-sectional<br>
structure of the microporous membrane in the thickness<br>
direction for every 1 pm thickness, and obtaining as an<br>
area ratio of void to each divided region by image-<br>
processing analysis. Electron microscope photography<br>
at this time was performed at 15,000 times<br>
magnification. The average open pore ratio is the<br>
average value of open pore ratio measured for the whole<br>
membrane thickness.<br>
(7) Thickness of coarse structure layer and ratio of<br>
fine structure layer to the whole thickness of membrane<br>
In the measurement of the above open pore<br>
ratio, it was judged whether each divided region agreed<br>
with the definition of the fine structure layer defined<br>
and the coarse structure layer as described. That is,<br>
the coarse structure layer is a continuous region<br>
existing adjacent to the membrane surface and in which<br>
the open pore ratio measured in the thickness direction<br>
is higher by 2% or more than the average value of the<br>
open pore ratio for the whole membrane thickness, and<br>
the fine structure layer is a region other than the<br>
coarse structure layer and in which the open pore: ratio<br>
measured in the thickness direction is within the range<br>
of less than ±2% of the average value of the open pore<br>
ratio for the region excluding the coarse structure<br>
layer. The ratio of the fine structure layer to the<br>
whole thickness of membrane is a value obtained by<br>
dividing the sum of the thicknesses of the agreeing<br>
regions by the whole membrane thickness.<br>
(8) Average pore size of the coarse structure layer<br>
side surface<br>
From the structure observation result of the<br>
coarse structure layer side surface, the number and<br>
area of pores which exist in the surface were measured<br>
by image-processing analysis, and a circle equivalent<br>
diameter of the pore was determined from the average<br>
area per pore assuming that the pore is a true circle.<br>
This circle equivalent diameter was regarded as the<br>
average pore size of the coarse structure layer side<br>
surface. Electron microscope (S-900, product of<br>
Hitachi, Ltd.) photography at this time was performed<br>
at 6,000 times magnification.<br>
(9) Measurement of contact angle on membrane<br>
The receding contact angle of the water on<br>
the membrane was measured by using a water for<br>
injection (product of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.;<br>
Japanese Pharmacopoeia) with the dynamic contact angle<br>
measuring instrument (DCAT11, product of DataPhysics<br>
Instruments GmbH). A hollow fiber membrane was cut to<br>
about 2 cm, and mounted on the equipment. The receding<br>
contact angle was measured using the principle of the<br>
Wilhelmy method. The motor speed at the time of<br>
measurement was 0.10 mm/second, the immersing depth was<br>
10 mm, and 5-cycle measurement was carried out by<br>
regarding the advance and retreat as one cycle. The<br>
receding contact angle used was the average value of<br>
the value acquired by 5 measurements.<br>
(10) Amount of adsorption of bovine immunoglobulin<br>
The bovine immunoglobulin solution from Life<br>
Technology, Ltd. was diluted with a physiological<br>
saline solution (product of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.,<br>
Ltd.; Japanese Pharmacopoeia) to a concentration of<br>
0.01 wt%, and this was used as a source solution for<br>
filtration. The source solution for filtration was<br>
subjected to constant-pressure dead-end filtration<br>
under a filtration pressure of 0.3 MPa and a filtration<br>
temperature of 25°C, and the filtrate at 50 liter/m2<br>
from the start of filtration was sampled. Absorption<br>
at a wavelength of 280 nm was measured for the source<br>
solution for filtration and the filtrate, and the<br>
amount of adsorption of bovine immunoglobulin was<br>
calculated from the following formula.<br>
Amount of adsorption of bovine immunoglobulin<br>
(mg/g) = (absorption of source solution for filtration<br>
- absorption of filtrate)/absorption of source solution<br>
for filtration x 0.005/membrane weight<br>
(11) Filtration test of 3 wt% bovine immunoglobulin<br>
solution<br>
The bovine immunoglobulin solution from Life<br>
Technology, Ltd. was diluted with a physiological<br>
saline solution (product of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.,<br>
Ltd.; Japanese Pharmacopoeia) to a concentration of 3<br>
wt%, and this was pre-filtered further by the<br>
filtration membrane (product of Asahi Kasei<br>
Corporation, PLANOVA35N) for removing impurities and<br>
then used as a source solution for filtration. As a<br>
result of measuring the molecular weight distribution<br>
of the bovine immunoglobulin in this source solution<br>
for filtration using liquid chromatography (product of<br>
TOSOH CORP., CCP&amp;8020 series, product of Amersham<br>
Biosciences Company, Superdex by 200 HR 10/30), the<br>
ratio of polymer of dimer or larger was not more than<br>
20 wt%. Constant-pressure dead-end filtration was<br>
performed for this source solution for filtration on<br>
conditions of a filtration pressure of 0.3 MPa and a<br>
filtration temperature of 25°C, and the permeation rate<br>
for 5 minutes after the start of filtration and for 55<br>
to 60 minutes after the start of filtration (Iiter/m2/h)<br>
was measured.<br>
(12) Logarithmic reduction value of porcine parvovirus<br>
As a source solution for filtration,<br>
supernatant of a culture solution of ESK cell (pig<br>
kidney cell) cultured in a Dulbecco's MEM culture-<br>
medium solution (product of Nihon Biopharmaceutical<br>
Research Institute) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine<br>
serum (product of Upstate, Ltd.) and infected with<br>
porcine parvovirus was used after pre-filtered by<br>
microporous membrane (product of Asahi Kasei<br>
Corporation, PLANOVA35N). Constant-pressure dead-end<br>
filtration was performed for this source solution for<br>
filtration under the condition of a filtration pressure<br>
of 0.3 MPa and a filtration temperature of 25°C. The<br>
filtrate was sampled as 11 fractions for every 5 ml (5<br>
liter/m2) , and in order to measure the logarithmic<br>
removing rate of porcine parvovirus at the time point<br>
by which 55 liter/m2 has been filtered from the start of<br>
filtration, 1 ml was respectively sampled from each<br>
fraction and mixed. The concentration of the porcine<br>
parvovirus in the source solution for filtration and<br>
the filtrate (the mixed solution and the first and the<br>
last fractions) was determined by TCID50 measuring<br>
method using agglutination reaction of chicken fresh<br>
erythrocyte (product of Nippon Biotest Laboratories,<br>
Inc.) after adding each liquid to ESK cell and<br>
culturing 10 days.<br>
Example 1<br>
After a composition consisting of 49 wt% of<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resin (SOLEF1012, product of<br>
SOLVAY Company, Crystal melting point: 173°C) and 51 wt%<br>
of dicyclohexyl phthalate (product of Osaka Organic<br>
Chemical Industry, Ltd., industrial grade product) was<br>
churned and mixed at 70°C using a Henschel mixer, the<br>
mixture was cooled into the shape of a powder and was<br>
supplied from the hopper and melt-blended using a two-<br>
axis extruder (Laboplast mill MODEL 50C 150, product of<br>
Toyo Seiki Seisaku-Sho, Ltd.) at 210°C so that the<br>
mixture was homogeneously dissolved. Then, the<br>
solution was extruded in the shape of a hollow fiber<br>
from a spinneret which consists of an annular orifice<br>
with an inner diameter of 0.8 mm and an outer diameter<br>
of 1.1 mm at a discharging rate of 17m/min while<br>
passing through the inside hollow part dibutyl<br>
phthalate (product of Sanken Kakoh Company) at a<br>
temperature of 130°C at a rate of 8 ml/min. The<br>
extruded solution was cooled and solidified in a water<br>
bath heat-controlled to 40°C and rolled up to a spinner<br>
at a rate of 60 m/min. Then dicyclohexyl phthalate and<br>
dibutyl phthalate were extracted and removed with 99%<br>
methanol modified ethanol (product of Imazu Chemical<br>
Co., Ltd., industrial grade product) and the attached<br>
ethanol was replaced with water, and a heat-treatment<br>
at 125°C was conducted for 1 hour using high-pressure<br>
steamy sterilization equipment (HV-85, product of<br>
Hirayama Factory, Ltd.) in the state where it was<br>
immersed in water. Then, after replacing attached<br>
water with ethanol, hollow fiber microporous membrane<br>
was obtained by drying at a temperature of 60°C in the<br>
oven. In order to prevent contraction during the steps<br>
from the extraction step to drying step, the membrane<br>
was fixed in a fixed size state and processed.<br>
Then, hydrophilizing treatment by the graft<br>
method was performed to the above microporous membrane.<br>
Hydroxypropyl acrylate (product of Tokyo Chemicals,<br>
Ltd., reagent grade) was dissolved in 25 vol% solution<br>
of 3-butanol (Pure Science, Ltd., special reagent<br>
grade) so that the former might be 8 vol%. The mixture<br>
was held at 40°C while subjected to nitrogen bubbling<br>
for 20 minutes, and then used as a reaction liquid.<br>
First, 100 kGy irradiation of y-ray was carried out by<br>
using Co60 as a radiation source, while cooling the<br>
microporous membrane at - 60°C with dry ice under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. After allowing to stand still the<br>
irradiated membrane under a reduced pressure of 13.4 Pa<br>
or less for 15 minutes, it was contacted with the<br>
above-described reaction liquid and the membrane was<br>
allowed to stand still at 40°C for 1 hour. Then, the<br>
membrane was washed with ethanol, vacuum drying at 60°C<br>
was performed for 4 hours, and the microporous membrane<br>
was obtained. It was confirmed that water<br>
spontaneously permeates into the pores when the<br>
obtained membrane was contacted with water. As a<br>
result of evaluating the performance of the obtained<br>
membrane, high performance was shown as in Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
A hollow fiber microporous membrane was<br>
obtained according to Example 1 except that a<br>
composition consisting of 39 wt% of polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride resin and 61 wt% of dicyclohexyl phthalate was<br>
extruded from a spinneret which consists of an annular<br>
orifice with an inner diameter of 0.8 mm and an outer<br>
diameter of 1.2 mm.<br>
Then, the above microporous membrane was<br>
subjected to hydrophilizing treatment according to<br>
Example 1. As a result of evaluating the performance<br>
of the obtained membrane, high performance was shown as<br>
in Table 1.<br>

obtained according to Example 2 except that a<br>
composition consisting of 4 6 wt% of polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride resin and 54 wt% of dicyclohexyl phthalate was<br>
homogeneously dissolved and the solution was extruded<br>
in the shape of a hollow fiber from a spinneret which<br>
consists of an annular orifice with an inner diameter<br>
of 0.8 mm and an outer diameter of 1.2 mm at a<br>
discharging rate of 5.5 m/min while passing through the<br>
inside hollow part diphenylcresyl phosphate (product of<br>
Daihachi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., industrial grade<br>
product) at a rate of 7 ml/min.<br>
Then, the above microporous membrane was<br>
subjected to hydrophilizing treatment according to<br>
Example 1. As a result of evaluating the performance<br>
of the obtained membrane, high performance was shown as<br>
in Table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
Hydrophilizing treatment was performed to the<br>
membrane obtained in Example 1. The hydrophilizing<br>
treatment was performed according to Example 1 except<br>
that 7.52 vol% of hydroxypropyl acrylate, 0.15 vol% (1<br>
mol% to hydroxypropyl acrylate) of polyethylene glycol<br>
diacrylate (product of Aldrich Co., average molecular<br>
weight 258) and 0.33 vol% (1 mol% to hydroxypropyl<br>
acrylate) of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (product of<br>
Aldrich Co., average molecular weight 575) were<br>
dissolved in 25 vol% solution of 3-butanol and used as<br>
a reaction liquid. As a result of evaluating the<br>
performance of the obtained membrane, high performance<br>
was shown as in Table 1.<br>
Example 5<br>
Hydrophilizing treatment was performed to the<br>
membrane obtained in Example 1. The hydrophilizing<br>
treatment was performed according to Example 1 except<br>
that 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate (product of Tokyo<br>
Chemicals Industry), was dissolved in 25 vol% solution<br>
of 3-butanol so that the former might be 8 vol% and<br>
used as a reaction liquid. As a result of evaluating<br>
the performance of the obtained membrane, high<br>
performance was shown as in Table 2.<br>
Example 6<br>
A hollow fiber microporous membrane: was<br>
obtained according to Example 1 except that a<br>
composition consisting of 48 wt% of polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride resin and 52 wt% of dicyclohexyl phthalate was<br>
homogeneously dissolved and the solution was extruded<br>
in the shape of a hollow fiber from a spinneret which<br>
consists of an annular orifice with an inner diameter<br>
of 0.8 mm and an outer diameter of 1.05 mm at a<br>
discharging rate of 20 m/min while passing through the<br>
inside hollow part dibutyl phthalate at a rate of 10<br>
ml/min. Then, the above microporous membrane was<br>
subjected to hydrophilizing treatment according to<br>
Example 1. As a result of evaluating the performance<br>
of the obtained membrane, high performance was shown as<br>
in Table 2.<br>
Example 7<br>
A hollow fiber microporous membrane was<br>
obtained according to Example 1 except that a<br>
composition consisting of 50 wt% of polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride resin and 50 wt% of dicyclohexyl phthalate was<br>
used.<br>
Then, the above microporous membrane was<br>
subjected to hydrophilizing treatment according to<br>
Example 1. As a result of evaluating the performance<br>
of the obtained membrane, high performance was shown as<br>
in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Hydrophilizing treatment was performed to the<br>
membrane obtained in Example 1 according to Example 1<br>
except that 1.23 vol% of hydroxypropyl acrylate, 0.61<br>
vol% (25 mol% to hydroxypropyl acrylate) of<br>
polyethylene glycol diacrylate (product of Aldrich Co.,<br>
average molecular weight 258), 1.36 vol% (25 mol% to<br>
hydroxypropyl acrylate) of polyethylene glycol<br>
diacrylate (product of Aldrich Co., average molecular<br>
weight 575) was dissolved in 25 vol% solution of 3-<br>
butanol and used as a reaction liquid. As a result of<br>
evaluating the performance of the obtained membrane, as<br>
shown in Table 3 it turns out that the decrease in the<br>
filtration rate of 3% bovine immunoglobulin solution<br>
with time is remarkable. It is considered that this<br>
was because the hydrophilizing treatment was performed<br>
using a reaction liquid containing a lot of cross-<br>
linking agent, and even though a sufficient coarse<br>
structure layer for the membrane exists, the filtration<br>
rate was reduced by adsorption of globulin.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A hollow fiber microporous membrane was<br>
obtained according to Example 1 except that a<br>
composition consisting of polyvinylidene fluoride resin<br>
and dicyclohexyl phthalate was homogeneously dissolved<br>
and the solution was extruded in the shape of a hollow<br>
fiber from a spinneret which consists of an annular<br>
orifice with an inner diameter of 0.8 mm and an outer<br>
diameter of 1.2 mm at a discharging rate of 5.5 m/min<br>
while passing through the inside hollow part diheptyl<br>
phthalate at a rate of 7 ml/min.<br>
Then, the above microporous membrane was<br>
subjected to hydrophilizing treatment. The<br>
hydrophilizing treatment was performed according to<br>
Example 1 except that hydroxypropyl acrylate and<br>
polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (product of Aldrich<br>
Co., average molecular weight 550) was dissolved in 25<br>
vol% solution of 3-butanol so that the acrylate and the<br>
dimethacrylate might respectively be 1.1 vol% and 0.6<br>
vol%. It was confirmed that water spontaneously<br>
permeates into the pores when the obtained membrane was<br>
contacted with water. As a result of evaluating the<br>
performance of the obtained membrane, as shown in Table<br>
3 it turns out that the permeation ability of 3% bovine<br>
globulin was very low.<br>
Example 8<br>
As a result of evaluating the removing<br>
ability of porcine parvovirus of the hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane obtained in Example 1, high<br>
performance was exhibited as shown in Table 4.<br>
