-	Figure 14 is an elevational view of the front intermediate cross-member enabling the different configurations according to figures 9 to 13 to be achieved,<br>
-	Figure 15 is a cross-sectional view along the line 15-15 of figure 14,<br>
-	Figure 16 shows an exploded perspective view of the cabinet according to figure 9,<br>
-	Figure 17 shows the cabinet of figure 16 in the final assembly state,<br>
-	Figure 18 represents assembly of the cabinet according to figure 11.<br>
With reference to figures 1 and 2, a monoblock back panel 10 is formed by a rectangular sheet metal plate drilled along its opposing vertical edges 12, 14 with a plurality of orifices 16. Two cross-members 18, 20 are fitted by clipping onto the back panel 10 by means of assembly elements inserted in the orifices 16 in the direction of the arrows F1 {figure 1) then secured by fastening following a translational movement indicated by the arrows F2 (figure 2).<br>
This assembly principle is described in detail in the document EP-A-557,213. The back panel moreover comprises a series of pre-drillings 22 to allow access to the cables from the rear. The cross-members 18, 20 can receive a mounting plate or rails for fixing of electrical switchgear apparatuses.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the frame 24 of the electrical cabinet formed by assembly of removable elements for ease of wiring and maintenance operations. A first pillar 26 and a second pillar 28 are fitted at the two upper corners of the back panel 10 ; at the bottom part a third and fourth pillars 30, 32 are fitted onto the panel 10 at an intermediate level defining the base 34.<br><br>
The base 34 is integrated rigidly onto the frame and is formed by two lateral gussets 36. 38 comprising means for fast-on fixing on the cross-members 18, 20 of the back panel 10 and on the third and fourth pillars 30, 32.<br>
The rear of the base 34 is blanked off by the back panel 10 with extension of the cross-members 18, 20 up to the bottom of the frame 24. At the front of the base 34 there is located a removable plinth designed to be fitted onto the front part of the gussets 36, 38. Disassembly of the plinth 40 and gussets 36, 38 makes for ease of connection of the cables from below. A cable grommet plate {not represented), also removable, can be arranged at the level of the interface between the base 34 and the upper zone for housing of the switchgear.<br>
The rest of the external finishing of the cabinet comprises side panels 42, 44 made of sheet metal with folded edges allowing access in the required connection zone, and an upper plate 46 in two parts for cable input. The different pillars 26, 28, 30, 32 of the frame 24 present faces visible from outside at the level of the assembly interfaces of the different removable elements of the covering plates. Integration of the rigid base 34 to the frame 24 enables the cabinet to be transported and handled.<br>
In figure 5, the right-hand fourth pillar 32 presents a double structure identical to that of the left-hand third pillar 30 and comprising an upper element 48 designed to receive the base of the side panel 44, and a lower element 50 for fixing of the gusset 38. A first screw 52 secures the lower part of the gusset 38 to the back panel 10 after passing through an orifice of the cross-member 20. A second screw 54 connects the upper part of the gusset 38 to the lower element 50 of the pillar 32.<br>
Figure 6 shows final fitting of the base 34 on the frame 24, the assembly being monoblock and rigid.<br>
Figure 7 represents assembly of the plinth 40 on the base 34. A positioning slot 56 arranged in a folded edge of the plinth 40 is first engaged in a protuberance 58 of each gusset 36, 38 {see arrow F3) so as to form an articulation device. The plinth 40 is then moved by pivoting in the direction of the arrow F4 to blank off the front face of the base 34.<br><br>
Figure 8 shows a schematic transverse sectional view of the basic cabinet A of figure 3, after assembly of the finishing elements except for the door. From this framework an increased installation and connection capacity of the cabinet can be achieved by adding additional housings or cabinets.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 Illustrate association of an extension housing to the right or left of the basic cabinet A. The housing G is provided with a back panel 100 on which two cross-members 18, 20 identical to those of the basic cabinet are fixed. The width of the back panel 100 of the housing G is smaller than that of the back panel 10 of the basic cabinet A.<br>
Modular assembly of the basic cabinet A and housing G is achieved by means of an intermediate front cross-member 60 having a symmetrical monoblock structure illustrated in detail in figures 14 and 15. The intermediate cross-member 60 comprises a V-shaped profiled section whose inclined edges 62, 64 are extended by two wings 66, 68 in the form of brackets. The edges 62, 64 each comprise a series of rectangular openings 70 to receive the hinges and bolt stops of the closing system, whereas the wings 66, 68 are drilled with a plurality of orifices 72 for fixing the front plate of the switchgear.<br>
The openings 70 and orifices 72 of the Intermediate cross-member 60 are arranged symmetrically with respect to the vertical mid-plane 74, and to the horizontal mid-plane 76. This double symmetry enables the housing G to be fitted on the right (figure 9) or on the left (figure 10), and also gives the choice of opening of the door being to the left or to the right.<br>
Figure 11 shows the assembly of figure 9 with the addition of a second basic cabinet A to the right of the housing G. The housing G is thus inserted between two basic cabinets A by means of two intermediate cross-menlbers 60.<br>
Figure 12 represents the association of two adjacent basic cabinets A and a housing G to the right.<br>
In figure 13, the housing G is located to the left of the two cabinets A. It is clear that other association configurations are possible to increase the switchgear installation and connection  capacity,  while using the same  standard  elements for external<br><br>
finishing and for the frame 24. Such an extension can be made before or after installation on site.<br>
Figure 16 shows an exploded perspective view of the cabinet according to figure 9, The right-hand gusset 38 is fitted on the side of the housing G, whereas assembly of the base 34 between the basic cat^net A and the housing G is achieved by means of an additional gusset 80 and pillar 82. Figure 17 shows the cabinet of figure 16 in the final erection position.<br>
Figure 18 shows assembly of the cabinet according to figure 11. A door 84 {figure 17) can be fitted to each basic cabinet A and to each housing G. The area covered by each door presents a vertical and horizontal symmetry plane. The door can be transparent or solid and can open to the right or to the left. The operating part 86 of each door 84 is located In the horizontal mid-plane.<br><br><br>
