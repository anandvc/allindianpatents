				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the implementation of a<br>
method and apparatus for estimating battery charge power<br>
and discharge power.<br>
Background Art<br>
A number of high-performance battery applications<br>
require precise real-time estimates of the power available<br>
to be sourced by the battery pack. For example, in Hybrid<br>
Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles<br>
(BEVs), the vehicle controller requires continuous up-to-<br>
date information from the Battery Management System (BMS)<br>
regarding the power that may be supplied to the electric<br>
motor from the battery pack, and power that may be supplied<br>
to the pack via regenerative braking or by active<br>
recharging via the motor. One current technique in the art,<br>
called the HPPC (Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization)<br>
method, performs this task of estimation by using the<br>
voltage limits to calculate the maximum charge and<br>
discharge limits. As described in the PNGV (Partnership for<br>
New Generation Vehicles) Battery Test Manual, Revision 3,<br>
February 2001, published by the Idaho National Engineering<br>
and Environment Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy,<br>
the HPPC method estimates maximum cell power by considering<br>
only operational design limits on voltage. It does not<br>
consider design limits on current, power, or the battery<br>
state-of-charge (SOC). Also the method produces a crude<br><br>
This prior art charge calculat ion method is limited in<br>
several respects. First, as noted above, the method does<br>
not use operational design limits in SOC, maximum current,<br>
or maximum power in the computation. More importantly, the<br>
cell model used is too primitive to give precise results.<br>
Overly optimistic or pessimistic values could be generated,<br>
either posing a safety of battery-health hazard or causing<br>
inefficient battery use.<br>
What is desired is a new method and apparatus for<br>
battery charge estimation based on a battery cell model.<br>
Such a cell model would be combined with a maximum-power<br>
algorithm that uses the cell model to give better power<br>
prediction. The new method would also take in operational<br>
design limits such as SOC, current, and power.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an<br>
apparatus for estimating discharge and charge power of<br>
battery applications, including battery packs used in<br>
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs).<br>
One embodiment is a charge prediction method that<br>
incorporates voltage, state-of-charge, power, and current<br>
design constraints, works for a user-specified prediction<br>
horizon At, and is more robust and precise than the state<br>
of the art. The embodiment has the option of allowing<br>
different modeling parameters during battery operation to<br>
accommodate highly dynamic batteries used in Hybrid<br>
Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) where<br>
such previous implementations were difficult.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention calculates<br>
maximum charge/discharge power by calculating . the maximum<br>
charge/discharge current using any combination of four<br>
primary limits:<br>
1.	state-of-charge (SOC) limits<br>
2.	voltage limits<br>
3.	current limits<br>
4 . power limits<br>
In one embodiment, the minimum absolute charge/discharge<br>
current value from the calculations using state-of-charge<br>
(SOC), voltage, and current limits is then chosen to obtain<br>
the maximum absolute charge/discharge power. In one<br>
embodiment, the maximum absolute charge/discharge power is<br>
checked to ensure it is within the power limits. In one<br>
embodiment, the maximum absolute charge/discharge power is<br>
calculated in a way as to not violate any combination of<br><br>
the limits that may be used.<br>
Prior methods do not use SOC limits in their estimation<br>
of maximum charge/discharge power. The present invention<br>
incorporates the SOC of the batte ry cell or battery pack to<br>
estimate the maximum charge/discharge current. The<br>
estimation explicitly includes a user-defined time horizon<br>
At. In one embodiment, the SOC is obtained by using a<br>
Kalman filter. The SOC that is produced by Kalman filtering<br>
also yields an estimate of the uncertainty value, which can<br>
be used in the maximum charge/discharge calculation to<br>
yield a confidence level of the maximum charge/discharge<br>
current estimate.<br>
Methods of the present inventions improve upon prior art<br>
estimation of power based on voltage limits. In the present<br>
invention, voltage limits are used to calculate the maximum<br>
charge/discharge current in a way that includes a user-<br>
defined time horizon At. Two primary cell model embodiments<br>
are in the present invention for the calculation of maximum<br>
charge/discharge power based on voltage limits. The first<br>
is a simple cell model that uses a Taylor-series expansion<br>
to linearize the equation involved. The second is a more<br>
complex and accurate cell model that models cell dynamics<br>
in discrete-time state-space form. The cell model can<br>
incorporate a variety of inputs such as temperature,<br>
resistance, capacity, etc. One advantage of using model-<br>
based approach is that the same cell model may be used in<br>
both Kalman filtering to produce the SOC and the estimation<br>
of maximum charge/discharge current based of voltage limits.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention also include<br>
methods of charge estimation based on any combination of<br><br>
the voltage, current, power, or SOC limits described above.<br>
For example, charge estimation can be based on voltage<br>
limits only, or combined with current limits, SOC limits<br>
and/or power limits.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a<br>
power apparatus that takes in data measurements from the<br>
battery such as current, voltage, temperature, and feeding<br>
such measurements to an arithmetic circuit, which includes<br>
calculation means that performs the calculation methods<br>
disclosed in the present invention to estimate the absolute<br>
maximum charge or discharge power.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relates to battery<br>
charge estimation for any battery-powered application. In<br>
one embodiment, the estimator method and apparatus find the<br>
maximum absolute battery charge and/or discharge power<br>
(based on present battery pack conditions) that may be<br>
maintained for At seconds without violating pre-set limits<br>
on cell voltage, state-of-charge, power, or current.<br>
Figs. 1A and IB illustrates an overview of the<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Fig. 1A shows a<br>
method for finding the maximum discharge power for a user-<br>
defined time horizon At, i.e. how much power may be drawn<br>
from the battery continuously for use for the next At time<br>
period. In vehicle applications, accurate estimation of<br>
maximum discharge power can help prevent the hazardous<br>
occurrence of over-drawing the battery.<br>
In step 10, the maximum discharge current is calculated<br>
based on pre-set limits on state-of-charge. The estimation<br><br>
explicitly includes a user-defined time horizon ∆t. In one<br>
embodiment, the SOC is obtained by using a kalman filtering<br>
method. The SOC that is produced by Kalman filtering also<br>
yields an estimate of the uncertainty value, which can be<br>
used in the maximum charge/discharge calculation to yield a<br>
confidence level of the maximum charge/discharge current<br>
estimation. In another embodiment, a simple state-of-charge<br>
is used. Step 10 is further described in the section titled<br>
"Calculation Based on State-of-Charge (SOC) Limits.<br>
The maximum discharge current is calculated based on<br>
pre-set limits on voltage in step 12. The present invention<br>
has two main model embodiments for calculation of maximum<br>
charge/discharge power based on voltage limits, although it<br>
is understood that other cell models could be used. Both<br>
overcome the limitation of prior art discharge estimation<br>
methods of giving a crude prediction of time horizon At.<br>
The first is a simple cell model that uses a Taylor-series<br>
expansion to linearize the equation involved. The second is<br>
a more complex and accurate cell model that models cell<br>
dynamics in discrete-time state-space form. The cell model<br>
can incorporate a variety of inputs such as temperature,<br>
resistance, capacity,,etc. The two cell models are further<br>
described in the section titled "Calculation Based on<br>
Voltage Limits."<br>
Then In step 14, the maximum discharge current is<br>
calculated based on pre-set limits on current. In step 16,<br>
the minimum of the three calculated current values from<br>
steps 10, 12, and 14 ,is chosen. It is understood that the<br>
execution order of steps 10, 12, 14 is interchangeable. It<br>
is further understood that any combination of steps 10, 12,<br><br><br>
and 14 may be omitted, if desired, in an implementation.<br>
Using the chosen discharge current value, step 18<br>
calculates the maximum discharge power. The calculated pack<br>
power may be further refined in order to not violate<br>
individual cell or battery pack power design limits.<br>
Fig. 1B shows a method for finding the maximum absolute<br>
charge power for a user-defined time horizon At, i.e. how<br>
much power can be put back into the battery continuously<br>
for the next At time period. The details and progression of<br>
the method mirror that of Fig. 1A. Since charge current is<br>
considered to have a negative sign, the maximum absolute<br>
current is the minimum current in a signed sense. In step<br>
20, the minimum charge current is calculated based on pre-<br>
set limits on state-of-charge. Again the SOC can be a<br>
simple one or one obtained using the Kalman filtering<br>
method. Then the minimum charge current is calculated based<br>
on pre-set limits on voltage in step 22 in accordance with<br>
a cell model, such as one of the two cell models described<br>
in the present disclosure. Then in step 24, the minimum<br>
. charge current is calculated based on pre-set limits on<br>
current. Then, in step 26, the maximum of the three<br>
calculated current values from steps 20, 22, 24 is chosen.<br>
Note again that the execution order of steps 20, 22, 24 is<br>
interchangeable. It, is further understood that any<br>
combination of steps 20, 22, 24 may be used and any of the<br>
steps 20, 22, 24 may be omitted, if desires, in an<br>
implementation. Using the chosen charge current value, step<br>
28 calculates the minimum charge power. The calculated pack<br>
power may be further refined in order to not violate<br>
individual cell or battery pack power design limits.<br><br>
It is noted that modifications may be made to the method<br>
embodiments as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B. For example, any<br>
or all of the current calculation steps based on state-of-<br>
charge and voltage limits may be removed. Also, the present<br>
invention discloses several methods of calculating maximum<br>
absolute charge and discharge current based on state-of-<br>
charge, voltage limits, and current limits.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention estimates the<br>
maximum absolute charge and/or discharge power of a battery<br>
pack. The battery pack may be, for example, a battery pack<br>
used in a hybrid electric vehicle or an electric vehicle.<br>
The embodiment makes a number of denotations and limits,<br>
including:<br>
-	using n to. denote the number of cells in the target<br>
battery pack where an estimation of charge and/or discharge<br>
power is desired;<br>
-	using vk(t) to denote the cell voltage for cell number<br>
k in the pack, which has operational design limits so that<br>
υmin ≤ υ¬(t) ≤ υmax musr be enforced for all k:l≤k≤n;<br><br>
-	using zk(t) to denote the state-of-charge for cell<br>
number k in the pack, which has operational design limits<br>
Zmin ≤ zk(t) ≤ zmax that must be enforced for all k:1≤k≤n;<br>
-	using Pk(t) to denote the cell power, which has a<br>
operational design limits so that Pmin ≤ Pk(t) ≤ pmax must be<br>
enforced for all k:1≤k≤n; and<br>
-	using ik(t) to denote the cell. current, which has a<br>
operational design limits so that imin ≤ ik (t) ≤ imax must be<br>
enforced for all k:1≤k≤n.<br>
Modifications can be made in alternate embodiments. For<br>
example, any particular limit may be removed if desired by<br><br>
replacing its value by ±°°, as appropriate. As an another<br>
example, limits such as vmax, vmin, zmax, zmin, imax, imin, Pmax,<br>
pmin may furthermore be functions of temperature and other<br>
factors pertaining to the present battery pack operating<br>
condition. In one embodiment, it is assumed that the<br>
discharge current and power have positive sign and the<br>
charge current and power have negative sign. Those skilled<br>
in the art will recognize that other sign conventions may<br>
be used, and that the description of the present invention<br>
can be adapted to these conventions in a forthright manner.<br>
In one embodiment, the model used for predicting charge<br>
assumes that the battery pack comprises ns cell modules<br>
connected i n series, where each cell module comprises np<br>
individual cells connected in parallel and ns≥1,nP≥1.<br>
Other configurations are possible and are accommodated by<br>
slight modifications to the method as described.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram showing the sensor<br>
components of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Battery 40 is connected to load circuit 48. For example,<br>
load circuit 48 could be a motor in an Electric Vehicle<br>
(EV) or Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). In some embodiments<br>
circuit 48 is a circuit that provides power and/or draws<br>
power. Measurements of battery and individual cell voltage<br>
are made with voltmeter(s) 44. Measurements of battery<br>
current are made with ammeter 42. Battery and individual<br>
cell temperatures are measured by temperature sensor(s) 46.<br>
Voltage, current and temperature measurements are processed<br>
with arithmetic circuit 50. Arithmetic circuit (estimator<br>
means) 50, takes in the measurements from the sensor<br>
components and perform the calculation methods of the<br><br>
present invention for power estimation. In some embodiment,<br>
temperature is not needed in the calculatxon methods.<br>
1. Calculation Based in State-of-Charge (SOC) Limits<br>
As shown in steps 10 and 20 of Figs 1A and 1B,<br>
embodiments of the present invention calculate the maximum<br>
charge/discharge current values using SOC limits. Various<br>
embodiments also have the explicit inclusion of a time<br>
horizon At in the calculation. The SOC limits are included<br>
as follows. First, for a constant current ik, the SOC<br>
recurrent relationship is described as:<br><br>
Where Zk(t) is the present SOC for cell k, zk(t+∆t) is<br>
the predicted SOC ∆t seconds into the future, C is the cell<br>
capacity in ampere-seconds, and Ηi is the Coulombic<br>
efficiency factor at current level ik. Here, for simplicity<br>
of presentation, it is assumed that Ηi =1 for discharge<br>
currents and Ηi = Η ≤ for charge currents.<br>
If there are design limits on SOC such that<br>
Zmin ≤ zk\t) ≤ Zmax for all cells in the pack, then current ik<br>
can be computed such that these limits are not exceeded.<br>
Simple algebra gives limits based on the SOC of each cell:<br><br><br>
The pack maximum absolute currents-based only on cell<br>
SOC-are then<br><br>
This method assumes that there is a valid SOC estimate<br>
available for every cell in the pack. If there is not the<br>
case, then an approximate remedy would be to calculate<br><br>
where z(t) is the pack SOC.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the power<br>
predictive method can take into account more information<br>
than simply the cell SOC. For example, a Kalman filter can<br>
be used as a method to estimate all the cell SOCs in a pack.<br>
Besides giving the SOC, Kalman filtering yields estimates<br>
of the uncertainty of the SOC estimate itself. A method of<br>
using Kalman filter to estimate SOC is described in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,534,954, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Let the uncertainty have Gaussian distribution with<br>
standard deviation, as estimated by the Kalman filter, be<br>
denoted as σz. Then, the method yields a95.5% confidence<br>
that the true SOC is within the estimate ±2 σz and a 99.7%<br>
confidence that the true SOC is within the estimate ±3 σz.<br>
This information can be incorporated into the estimate<br><br>
of maximum current based on SOC to have very high<br>
confidence that SOC design Limits will not be violated.<br>
This is done as (assuming a 3 σz confidence interval):<br><br>
2. Calculation Based on Voltage Limits<br>
Besides taking SOC, limits into account, embodiments of<br>
the present invention ;correct a limitation in the prior art<br>
HPPC method for applying voltage limits (steps 12 and 22 of<br>
Figs. 1A and 1B). In the HPPC method, if the cell model of<br>
equation (1) is assumed, and that Rchg and Rdis are the<br>
cell's Ohmic resistances, then equation (2) and equation<br>
(3) predict the instantaneously available current, not the<br>
constant value of current that is available for the next At<br>
seconds. If cases where At is large, the result of the<br>
calculation poses a safety or battery-health issue, as the<br>
cells may become over/under charged.<br>
To overcome this problem, an embodiment of the present<br>
invention uses the following cell model:<br><br>
This modifies the previous cell model in equation (1) .<br>
Note that this model cannot be directly solved in closed<br>
form for the maximum current ik since Zk(t+∆t) is itself a<br>
function of current . (cf.(4)) and OCV(•) is a nonlinear<br>
relationship. Note that other cell models can be used as<br>
well.<br>
Two method embodiments are directed to solving (7) for<br><br>
the maximum absolute value of ik(t) .<br>
2.1Method I: Taylor-series expansion<br>
The first method uses a Taylor-series expansion to<br>
linearize the equation, so that at approximate value of 1<br>
can be solved. It is assumed that OCV(•) is differentiable<br>
at point zk(t) , which gives the result<br><br>
In one embodiment, both the function OCV(z) and its<br>
derivative ∂0CV(z)/ ∂z might be computed from some known<br>
 mathematical relationship for OCV(z), (e.g., Nernst's<br><br>
equation) using either analytic or numeric methods, or by a<br>
table lookup of empirical data. This quantity is positive<br>
for most battery electrochemistries over the entire SOC<br>
range, so the values computed by (8) and (9) are smaller in<br>
magnitude than those from (2) and (3) for the same values<br>
of Rdis and Rchg.<br>
The HPPC procedure compensates for its inaccuracy by<br>
using modified values of Rdis and Rchg, determined<br>
experimentally, that approximate the denominator terras in<br>
(8) and (9) . This can not be accurate over the entire SOC<br>
range, however, as ∂OCV(z)/ ∂z is not constant,<br>
particularly near extreme values of z.<br>
Discharge and charge currents with all limits enforced<br>
are computed as (steps 16 and 26 of Figs. 1A and 1B)<br><br>
and power may be calculated using the sum of all cell<br>
powers. These are equal to the product of the maximum<br>
allowed current and the predicted future voltage.<br><br><br><br>
Maximum and minimum cell and pack power limits may also<br>
be imposed in this calculation. Note that in all equations,<br>
OCV(z), C, vmax, vmin, zmax zmin imax, imin: Rchq, and Rais may be<br>
functions of temperature and other factors pertaining to<br>
the present battery pack operating conditions.<br>
2.2 Method II: Using a Comprehensive Cell Model<br>
The method of solving (7) presented in the previous<br>
section reguires less computational intensity. A second<br>
method embodiment of the present invention may be used when<br>
more computational power is available. This second method<br>
assumes a more precise mathematical model of cell dynamics,<br>
which might be in a discrete-time state-space form such as<br>
the coupled pair of equations<br><br>
where m is the discrete time sample index, the vector<br>
function of time xk[m) is called the "state" of the system,<br>
uk[m] is the input to the system, which includes cell<br>
current ik[m] as a component, and might also include<br>
temperature, resistance, capacity and so forth, and f(.)<br>
and g(.) are functions chosen to model cell dynamics.<br><br>
Alternative model forms, including continuous-time state-<br>
space forms, differential and difference equations might<br>
also be used. It is assumed that there is a method to<br>
compute SOC given the model that is implemented.<br>
For convenience of presentation, it is assumed that the<br>
cell model is in a discrete-time state-space form. Also<br>
assume that At seconds may be represented in discrete time<br>
as T sample intervals. Then, this model can be used' to<br>
predict cell voltage At seconds into the future by<br><br>
where xk[m + T] may be found by simulating (14) for T time<br>
samples. It is assumed that the input remains constant from<br>
time index m to m+T, so if temperature change (for example)<br>
over this interval is significant, it must be included as<br>
part of the dynamics modeled by (14) and not as a part of<br>
the measured input uk[m].<br>
The method then uses a bisection search algorithm to<br>
  by looking for the ik (as a member of<br>
the uk vector) that causes equality in<br><br>
to find , and by looking for the ik that causes<br>
equality in<br><br><br>
to find   A special case is when the state<br>
equation (14) is linear-that is, when<br><br>
where A and B are constant matrices. The model presented<br>
in Section 3, entitled "An Example Cell Model," is an<br>
example where this is the case. Then, for input uk constant<br>
time m to m+T, leading to<br><br>
Most of these terms may be pre-computed without<br>
knowledge of uk in order to speed calculation using the<br>
bisection algorithm.<br>
Once the SOC-based current limits  are<br>
computed using (5) and (6), and the voltage-based current<br>
limits   are computed using (16) and (17),<br>
overall current limits may be computed using (10) and (11)<br>
(steps 16 and 26 of Figs. 1A and 1B) . Power is then<br>
computed as<br><br>
with uk containing as its value for current, and<br><br><br>
1.2.1 Bisection search<br>
To solve (16) and (17), a method to solve for a root of<br>
a nonlinear equation is required. In one embodiment the<br>
bisection search algorithm is used for this requirement.<br>
The bisect ion search algorithm looks for a root of f (x)<br>
(i.e., a value of x such that f{x)=0) where it is known a<br>
priori that the root lies between values X1 ≤ root ≤ x2.<br>
One way of knowing that a root lies in this interval is<br>
that the sign of f(X1) is different from the sign of f (x2) ,<br>
Each iteration of the bisection algorithm evaluates the<br>
function at the midpoint xmid = (x1 + x2)/2. Based on the<br>
sign of the evaluation, either x1 or X2 is replaced by xmid<br>
to retain different signs on of f(x1) and f(x2) . It is<br>
evident that the uncertainty in the location of the root is<br>
halved by this algorithmic step. The bisection algorithm<br>
repeats this iteration until the interval between x1 and x2,<br>
and hence the resolution of the root of f(x) is as small as<br>
desired. If ε is the desired root resolution, then the<br>
algorithm will require at most <br>
iterations. The bisection method is listed in Listing 1.<br>
1.2.2 ■ Finding maximum/minimum current<br>
 To determine maximum discharge and charge current for<br>
any particular cell, bisection is performed on (16) and<br><br>
(17). Bisection is incorporated in the overall algorithm ad<br>
follows. First, three stimulations are performed to<br>
determine cell voltages At seconds into the future for cell<br>
current ik = 0, ik = imin and ik = imax. if cell voltages are<br>
predicted to be between vmin and vmax for the maximum<br>
dis/charge rates, then these maximum rates may be used. If<br>
the cell voltages, even during rest, are outside of bounds,<br>
then set the maximum rates to zero. Otherwise, the true<br>
maximum rate may be found by bisecting between rate equal<br>
to zero and its maximum value. Bisection is performed<br>
between current limits (imin, 0) or (0, imax) .<br><br>
2. An example Cell Model<br>
An example cell model for the present invention power<br>
estimation methods is presented herein, with illustrations<br><br>
given to show the performance of the two methods compared<br>
to the prior art PNGV HPPC method. The cell model is a<br>
discrete-time state-space model of the form of (14) and<br>
(15) that applies to battery cells. The model, named<br>
"Enhanced Self-Correcting Cell Model," is further described<br>
in the article "Advances in EKFLiPB SOC Estimation," by the<br>
inventor, published in CD-ROM and presented in Proc. 20th<br>
Electric Vehicle Symposium (EVS20) in Long Beach CA,<br>
(November 2003) and is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference. It is understood this model is an example model<br>
only and that a variety of suitable alternate models can be<br>
used.<br>
The "Enhanced Self-Correcting Cell Model" includes<br>
effects due to open-circuit-voltage, internal resistance,<br>
voltage time constants, and hysteresis. For the purpose of<br>
example, the parameter values are fitted to this model<br>
structure to model the dynamics of high-power Lithium-Ion.<br>
Polymer Battery (LiPB) cells, although the structure and<br>
methods presented here are general.<br>
State-of-charge is captured by one state of the model.<br>
This equation is<br><br>
where ∆T represents the inter-sample period (in seconds),<br>
and C represents the cell capacity (in ampere-seconds).<br>
The time-constants of the cell voltage response are<br>
captured by several filter states. If there is let to be nf<br>
time constants, then<br><br>
The matrix . may be a diagonal matrix with<br><br>
real-valued entries. If so, the system is stable if all<br>
entries have magnitude less than one. The vector B<br>
may simply be set to nt "l"s. The value of nf and the<br>
entries in the Af matrix are chosen as part of the system<br>
identification procedure to best fit the model parameters<br>
to measured cell data.<br>
The hysteresis level is captured by a single state<br><br>
where γ is the hysteresis rate constant, again found by<br>
system identification.<br>
The overall model state is<br><br>
where the symbol(') is the matrix/vector transpose<br>
operator. The state equation for the model is formed by<br>
combining all of the individual equations, above. Note,<br>
that at each time step, the state equation is linear in the<br>
input<br><br>
which speeds the prediction operation.<br>
The output equation that combines the state values to<br>
predict cell voltage is<br><br>
where  is a vector of constants that blend the<br>
time-constant states together in the output, R is the cell<br><br>
resistance (different values may be used for dis/charge),<br>
and M is the maximum hysteresis level.<br>
The open-circuit-voltage as a function of state-of-<br>
charge for example Lithium Ion Polymer Battery (LiPB) cells<br>
is plotted in Fig.3. This is an empirical relationship<br>
found by cell testing. First, the cell was fully charged<br>
(constant current to 4.2V, constant voltage to 200mA). Then,<br>
the cell was discharged at the C/25 rate until fully<br>
discharged (3.0V). The cell was then charged at the C/25<br>
rate until the voltage was 4.2V. The low rates were used to<br>
minimize the dynamics excited in the cells. The cell<br>
voltage as a function of state of charge under discharge<br>
and under charge were averaged to compute the OCV. This has<br>
the effect of eliminating to the greatest extent possible<br>
the presence of hysteresis and ohmic resistance in the<br>
final function. For the purpose of computations involving<br>
OCV, the final curve was digitized at 200 points and stored<br>
in a table. Linear interpolation is used to look up values<br>
in the table.<br>
The partial derivative of OCV with respect to SOC for<br>
these example cells is plotted in Fig. 4. This relationship<br>
was computed by first taking finite differences between<br>
points in the OCV plot in Fig. 3 and dividing by the<br>
distance between points (i.e., Euler's approximation to a<br>
derivative) . The resulting data is too noisy to be of<br>
practical use, as shown in the gray line of Fig. 4. It was<br>
filtered using a zero-phase low-pass filter, resulting in<br>
the black line of Fig. 4, which may be used in the power<br>
calculation. This relationship is also digitized at 200<br>
points, and linear interpolation into the table of values<br><br>
is used when computations requiring this function are<br>
performed.<br>
Other parameters are fit to the cell model. In<br>
particular, the model employs four low-pass filter states<br>
(nf = 4), a nominal capacity of 7.5 Ah, and an inter-sample<br>
interval of ∆T = 1s. There is very close agreement between<br>
the cell model voltage prediction and the cell true voltage.<br>
This is illustrated in Fig. 5, which is a plot showing the<br>
voltage prediction using the cell model of the present<br>
invention. For this figure, the cell test was a sequence of<br>
sixteen UDDS cycles, performed at room temperature,<br>
separated by discharge pulses and five-minute rests, and<br>
spread over the 90%. to 10% SOC range. The difference<br>
between true cell terminal voltage and estimated cell<br>
terminal voltage is very small (a root-mean-squared (RMS)<br>
voltage estimation error of less than 5mV). To better<br>
illustrate the model's fidelity, refer to the zoom on one<br>
UDDS cycle in the 50% SOC region, shown in Fig. 6. The SOC<br>
as a function of time is plotted in Fig. 7, which is a SOC<br>
trace for cell test. The graph shows that SOC increases by<br>
about 5% during each UDDS cycle, but is brought down about<br>
10% during each discharge between cycles. The entire<br>
operating range for these cells . (10% SOC to 90% SOC,<br>
delineated on the figure as the region between the thin<br>
dashed lines) is excited during the cell test.<br>
3. Comparing Maximum Power Calculations<br>
The PNGV HPPC power estimation method gives a result<br>
that is a function of only SOC. Therefore, it is possible<br>
to graph available power versus SOC to summarize the<br><br>
algorithm calculations. The first method proposed (Method<br>
I: Taylor Series Expansion Methods) in this patent<br>
disclosure is also possible to display in this way.<br>
Estimated power is only a function of SOC, ∂0CV/∂z (also a<br>
function of SOC), and static limits on maximum current and<br>
power. The second method (Method II: the Comprehensive Cell<br>
Model Method), however, dynamically depends on all states<br>
of the system. Two systems at the same state of charge, but<br>
with different voltage time-constant state values or<br>
hysteresis state levels will have different amounts of<br>
power available. To compare power computed by the three<br>
methods, dynamic tests must be conducted.<br>
For the following result, a pack of LiPB cells is<br>
assumed to be with ns = 40 and np - 1. The data to fit<br>
models was collected from prototype hand-made cells jointly<br>
developed by LG Chem (Daejeon, Korea) and Compact Power Inc.<br>
(Monument, Colorado).Limits for the power calculations are<br>
listed in Table 1. Each cell has a nominal capacity of 7.5<br>
Ah, and At was ten seconds for both charge and discharge.<br><br>
First, the PNGV HPPC method and Method I of the present<br>
invention are compared in Fig. 8, which is a plot comparing<br>
static maximum power calculations as functions of SOC for<br>
the PNGV HPPC method and Method I of the present invention.<br>
The black curves correspond to charge power, and the gray<br>
 curves correspond to discharge power. Note that the<br><br>
prediction for horizon At. Each cell in the battery pack is<br>
modeled by the approximate relationship<br><br>
where OCV(zk(t)) is the open-circuit-voltage of cell k<br>
at its present state-of-charge (zk(t)) and R is a constant<br>
representing a cell's internal resistance. Different values<br>
of R may be used for charge and discharge currents, if<br>
desired, and are denoted as Rchq and Rdis, respectively.<br>
Since the design limits must be enforced,<br>
the maximum discharge current may be calculated as<br>
constrained by voltage, as shown below<br><br>
The maximum magnitude charge current may be similarly<br>
calculated based on voltage. Note, however, that charge<br>
current is assumed negative in sign by convention employed<br>
in the present invention (although the opposite convention<br>
may be used with minor modifications to the method) , so<br>
that maximum-magnitude current is a minimum in the signed<br>
sense. It is<br><br><br>
absolute value of power is plotted to avoid confusion due<br>
to sign conventions. Considering first the calculations of<br>
charge power, it is evident that the PNGV HPPC method<br>
produces similar values to Method I in the mid-SOC range.<br>
The slight differences are due to the fact that the 10-<br>
second Rchg value used for the PNGV method and the<br>
derivative-modified _Rchg for Method I are not identical.<br>
Outside the mid-SOC range, the graph shows that Method I<br>
ramps power down in the neighborhood of zmax to avoid over-<br>
charging the cell, whereas the PNGV method has no such<br>
limits. At very low SOCs, the PNGV method over-predicts how<br>
much power is available since there are no current limits<br>
applied to the calculation. The Method I estimate is<br>
automatically lower due to the large derivative in the<br>
denominator of the calculation. This causes an anomaly near<br>
zero SOC where the method under-predicts the available<br>
charge power. However, since the cell will not be operated<br>
in this range, this is not a concern.<br>
Considering now the discharge power curves, the<br>
comparison shows that Method I imposes limits on discharge<br>
power to ensure that the cell is not under-charged, whereas<br>
the PNGV method does not. In the SOC range from about 15%<br>
to 35%, the two methods predict similar powers. For SOC<br>
above about 35%, the power predicted by Method I saturates<br>
because the maximum discharge current limit of 200A has<br>
been reached. The PNGV method does not consider this limit.<br>
At SOC around 99% the graph again shows an anomaly in the<br>
Method I calculation where power is under-estimated due to<br>
the large derivative; term. This apparent glitch is not a<br>
problem since the cell will not be operated in this range.<br><br>
Figs. 9 through 13 show how the two main voltage-limit<br>
based methods of power estimation of the present invention<br>
(Method I and Method II) compare to the prior art PNGV<br>
method in the dynamic cell tests shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 9 is<br>
i<br>
a plot showing that discharge power capability estimates<br>
for cell cycle test comprising sixteen UDDS cycles over an<br>
SOC range of 90% down to 10%. Fig. 10 is zoorned-in plot of<br>
Fig. 9, showing about one UDDS cycle. Fig. 11 is a plot<br>
showing charging power capability estimates for cell cycle<br>
test comprising sixteen UDDS cycles over an SOC range of<br>
90% down to 10%. Fig. 12 is zoomed-in plot of Fig. 11,<br>
showing about one UDDS cycle. Again, the absolute value of<br>
power is plotted.<br>
In the discussion that follows, the results of Method II<br>
are considered to be. the "true" capability of the cell.<br>
This assumption is justified by the fidelity of the cell<br>
model's voltage estimates, as supported by the data in Fig.<br>
6. Fig. 9 shows that the three methods produce similar<br>
estimates. In particular, Method I and Method II appear to<br>
be nearly identical when viewed at this scale. At high SOCs,<br>
the PNGV HPPC method predicts higher power than is actually<br>
available (by as much as 9.8%), and at low SOCs, the PNGV<br>
HPPC method under-predicts the available power. Only the<br>
methods of the present invention include SOC bounds, which<br>
explain why their predictions are so different from the<br>
PNGV HPPC estimates at low SOC. If the vehicle controller<br>
were to discharge at the rates predicted, by the PNGV HPPC<br>
method, the cell would be over-discharged in some cases<br>
(lowering its lifetime), and under-utilized in other cases.<br>
) Fig. 10 zooms in on Fig. 9 (same region shown as in Fig. 6)<br><br>
to show greater detail. In this region, the three methods<br>
produce nearly identical predictions. A notable feature of<br>
Method II, however, is that it takes into account the<br>
entire dynamics' of the cell when making a prediction.<br>
Therefore, the strong discharges at around time 237 and 267<br>
minutes draw the cell voltage down, and allows less<br>
discharge power than the other two methods which only<br>
consider SOC when making their estimate.<br>
The three methods, are also compared with respect to<br>
charge power, shown in Fig. 11. At this scale, the<br>
estimates appear nearly identical. Again, the PNGV HPPC<br>
method does not consider SOC limits, so over-predicts<br>
charge power at high SOCs. It also over-predicts power at<br>
low SOCs as it ignores the increase to charge resistance at<br>
low SOC. A zoom of this plot is shown in Fig. 12, which<br>
accentuates the differences between the predictions. Here,<br>
it can be seen that, the strong discharges at around time<br>
237 and 267 minutes allow for greater charging power, as<br>
the voltage will not quickly change.<br>
