Table showing the whole history of attempts till the present invention..<br><br><br><br>
The present invention is a unique method of presenting Chyavanaprasham to all age groups and to the world community.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally Chyavanaprasham is in semi solid Leha' consistency. The colour is dark brown and with aroma of the herbs and jaggery. According to Ayurvedic texts the shelf life of Avalehas or Lehas is three to six months. As the shelf Life is very short, storing, packing, dispensing and consuming the medicine is most inconvenient. So, this<br><br>
new concept ot Chyavanaprasham biscuits is an altogether new drug formulation system brought about to solve the major drawbacks of Chyavanaprasham, like colour, odour, packing, storing, dispensing and consuming. This is in a most attractive form, good taste and aroma, which will be readily accepted by all age groups.<br>

The example should not be taken as implying any necessary limitation on the essential scope of the invention.<br><br>
This is a new method of administering an Ayurvedic tonic preparation (Rasayana) in an agreeable, palatable and acceptable form to all age groups of people especially children.<br>
In Ayurveda there are many tonic preparations, which fortify, nourish and replenish the human body. They are generally called as Rasayanas. These preparations have high nutritive value and provide immunity power and resistance against diseases and they can be called as nutraceuticals of Ayurveda.<br>
These Rasayanas are prepared from natural herbs. An aqueous extract (decoction) is prepared by using combination of herbs by boiling the herbs in a steam boiler by<br>
th<br>
adding eight times purified water and it is reduced to 1/8 of the water added initially. Then it is filtered. In this decoction sugar (Jaggery) is added at a temperature of 100 degree C and the temperature is brought down to room temperature. At this temperature the herbal powders, which have to be added are slowly added by continuous stirring and mixing till it attains the prescribed semisolid consistency. This is known in Ayurveda as avaleha or leha preparation. Generally lehas are slightly sweet and with the tastes of the herbs used for the preparation of decoction and the powders added at last. This may not be very much agreeable to the consumer sometimes. Children generally do not like to consume such preparations because of the taste, colour and odour.<br>
Hence by adding certain ingredients it is made palatable and with a natural aroma to suit the tastes of all age group of people. Now let us go in detail, into the preparation of the biscuits.<br><br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide for a method of manufacture of Chyavanaprasham biscuits, which is unique.<br>
Another object of the invention is to invent a process of manufacture Chyavanaprasham biscuits.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Chyavanaprasham is a well-known Rasayanam. Rasayanam' means, the means to purify and develop the seven constituent tissues (Dhatus) of the body.

Ayurveda, which included in the Schedule -1 of Drugs and Cosmetics<br>
Act.<br>
c.	Biscuits are made in the closed moulds and the ingredients are also<br>
slightly different, whereas Cookies are kept in an open oven.<br><br>
d.	This is different from Conventional Cookies because this has a certain<br>
percentage of Chyavanaprasham added at appropriate stage of<br>
processing of CooKies.<br>
e.	These features score over Conventional Cookies or biscuits due to<br>
presence of Chyavanaprasham in a more palatable form and it will<br>
have all its therapeutic values.<br>
f.	The specific advantage of this invention is that it is more palatable and<br>
user friendly than the original Chyavanaprasham which can be carried<br>
without difficulty while on travelling also. Children will like the taste<br>
of Cookies.<br>
g.	The biscuits are very crispy.<br>
h. The shelf life of the biscuit is one year, if kept in an airtight container or food grade polythene pack.<br>
i.	In terms of shape it looks like ordinary cookies and in terms of shelf<br>
life it lasts one year.<br>
j.	Chyavanaprasham    made    by    others    is    different    from    the<br>
Chyavanaprasham in this invention is because of difference in the process and proportion of ingredients added and also difference in some of the ingredients as different industries follows different reference texts.<br>
k. Though the concept of Cookies and Chyavanaprasham are old and already in the market but this is the first time one is innovating a new process in which both these items are processed in a unique way to develop a new product which has the goodness of Cookies as well as Chyavanaprasham.<br><br>
