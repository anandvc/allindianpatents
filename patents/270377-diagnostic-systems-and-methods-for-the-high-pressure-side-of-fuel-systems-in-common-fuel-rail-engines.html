				<td>DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR THE HIGH PRESSURE SIDE OF FUEL SYSTEMS IN COMMON FUEL RAIL ENGINES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/965, 9 , filed on August 20, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to internal combustion engines<br>
and more particularly to diagnostic systems for the high pressure side of a fuel<br>
system in a common fuel rail engine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[000 ] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an engine<br>
system 100 is presented. Air is drawn into an engine 102 through an intake<br>
manifold 104. A throttle valve 106 is actuated by an electronic throttle control<br>
(ETC) motor 108 to vary the volume of air drawn into the engine 102. The air<br><br>
mixes with fuel from one or more fuel injectors 110 to form an air-fuel mixture.<br>
The air-fuel mixture is combusted within one or more cylinders 112 of the engine<br>
102. Resulting exhaust gas is expelled from the cylinders to an exhaust system<br>
11 .<br>
[0005] Fuel is supplied to the engine 102 by a fuel system. For<br>
example only, the fuel system may include the fuel injectors 110, a fuel tank 114,<br>
a low pressure pump 115, a high pressure pump 116, and a fuel rail 118. Fuel is<br>
stored within the fuel tank 114. A low pressure pump 115 draws fuel from the<br>
fuel tank 114 and provides fuel to the high pressure pump 116. The high<br>
pressure pump 116 provides pressurized fuel to the fuel injectors 110 via the fuel<br>
rail 118. The fuel injectors 110, the high pressure pump 116, and the fuel rail<br>
118 will be collectively referred to as the high pressure side of the fuel system.<br>
[0006] An engine control module (ECM) 120 receives a rail pressure<br>
signal from a rail pressure sensor 122. The rail pressure signal indicates the<br>
pressure of the fuel within the fuel rail 118 (i.e., rail pressure). The ECM 120<br>
controls the amount and the timing of the fuel injected by the fuel injectors 110.<br>
The rail pressure decreases each time fuel is injected by one or more of the fuel<br>
injectors 110. The ECM 120 maintains the rail pressure via the high pressure<br>
pump 116.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br><br>
[0028] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0029] Faulty fuel injectors may be a common cause of fuel system<br>
problems in a vehicle. A service technician who suspects a fuel system problem<br>
may attempt to resolve the suspected problem by first replacing the fuel injectors,<br>
without knowing whether the fuel injectors are faulty. This may lead to the<br>
replacement of functional fuel injectors. If the high pressure side of the fuel<br>
system could be tested, a passing test result could eliminate the high pressure<br>
side as the source of the problem. As part of the high pressure side, the fuel<br>
injectors are likely reliable, and the service technician may then avoid replacing<br>
them.<br>
[00 0] When an engine shuts down, the high pressure pump also shuts<br>
down. For example, the high pressure pump may be driven from a crankshaft or<br>
camshaft, and therefore slows as the engine comes to a stop. Fuel at high<br>
pressure in the fuel rail may then leak back through the inactive pump. In<br>
addition, one or more valves may be opened to release the high pressure fuel. A<br>
faulty fuel injector may allow fuel to escape, such as into the cylinder, and<br>
therefore the rail pressure will decrease at a faster rate than normal. Fault in the<br>
high pressure side of the fuel system may be detected based upon the rate at<br>
which the rail pressure decreases after engine shutdown. Accordingly, fault in<br><br>
the fuel injectors, as a part of the high pressure side of the fuel system, may be<br>
ruled out when fault has not been detected in the high pressure side.<br>
[00 1] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary engine system 200 is presented. The engine 102 may be any type of<br>
internal combustion engine, such as a spark ignition type engine or a<br>
compression ignition type engine. Although three fuel injectors and cylinders are<br>
shown, the engine 102 may include more or fewer fuel injectors and cylinders.<br>
For example only, one fuel injector 110 may be provided for each cylinder 112.<br>
[00 2] The fuel system supplies fuel to the engine 102. For example<br>
only, the fuel system may include the fuel injectors 110, the fuel tank 114, the low<br>
pressure pump 115, the high pressure pump 116, and the fuel rail 118. The high<br>
pressure pump 116 provides pressurized fuel to the fuel injectors 110 via the fuel<br>
rail 118. The fuel injectors 110, the high pressure pump 116, and the fuel rail<br>
118 are collectively referred to as the high pressure side of the fuel system.<br>
[00 ] An engine control module (ECM) 220 receives the rail pressure<br>
signal from the rail pressure sensor 122. During engine operation, the ECM 220<br>
maintains the rail pressure via the high pressure pump 116. For example only,<br>
the ECM 220 may maintain the rail pressure at approximately an operating<br>
pressure, such as 5 MPa. Upon engine shutdown, the high pressure pump 116<br>
stops pumping. In various implementations, engine shutdown may correspond to<br>
a time when the engine 102 comes to a stop. Alternatively, engine shutdown<br>
may correspond to a time when a driver "keys off the engine.<br><br>
[00 4] A high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 diagnoses faults in<br>
the high pressure side of the fuel system based upon how fast the rail pressure<br>
decays after shutdown. The high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 may<br>
diagnose fault in the high pressure side (e.g., the fuel injectors 110, the high<br>
pressure pump 116, and/or the fuel rail 118) when, for example, the rail pressure<br>
decays too fast. The fuel rail 118, however, is unlikely to fail, and its failure<br>
would likely be detected by other diagnostics. The fuel injectors 110 may be<br>
more likely to fail than the high pressure pump 116, and therefore the fuel<br>
injectors 110 may be the most likely cause of faults in the high pressure side.<br>
[00 5] The high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 generates a fault<br>
signal, which indicates whether fault has been detected in the high pressure side.<br>
In various implementations, the high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 may<br>
detect fault in the high pressure side when a calculated decay rate is greater than<br>
a threshold.<br>
[00 6] In various other implementations, the high pressure side<br>
diagnostic module 2 0 may diagnose fault in the high pressure side of the fuel<br>
system without actually calculating the decay rate. For example only, the high<br>
pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 may detect fault in the high pressure side<br>
when the rail pressure measured at a predetermined period after engine<br>
shutdown is less than a pressure threshold. Alternatively, the high pressure side<br>
diagnostic module 2 0 may detect fault in the high pressure side when the period<br>
of time between engine shutdown and a time at which the rail pressure falls<br>
below the predetermined pressure is less than a predetermined period.<br><br>
[00 7] The ECM 220 receives the fault signal and may signal an error<br>
when fault has been detected in the high pressure side. For example only, the<br>
ECM 220 may set an error code when fault has been detected. A service<br>
technician may then determine whether to replace the fuel injectors 110 based<br>
upon whether the error code is set. The ECM 220 may also illuminate a light,<br>
such as a "check engine light," when fault has been detected in the high pressure<br>
side.<br>
[00 8] Referring now to FIG. , a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary implementation of the high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 is<br>
presented. The high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 includes a timer 02,<br>
a pressure module 04, a decay calculation module 06, and a fault diagnostic<br>
module 08. The timer 02 tracks the time elapsed after engine shutdown. In<br>
various implementations, the timer 02 may be started from a predetermined<br>
reset value, such as zero.<br>
[00 9] The pressure module 04 receives the rail pressure signal from<br>
the rail pressure sensor 122 and may, for example, filter, buffer, and/or digitize<br>
the rail pressure signal. For example only, the pressure module 04 may sample<br>
the rail pressure signal at a predetermined sampling rate, such as one sample<br>
every 0.1 seconds. The pressure module 04 provides a rail pressure to the<br>
decay calculation module 06. Additionally, the pressure module 04 may<br>
provide the rail pressure to the fault diagnostic module 08.<br>
[0040] The decay calculation module 06 calculates the decay rate<br>
based upon the rail pressure. In various implementations, the decay rate may be<br><br>
an average rate of change of the rail pressure over a predetermined period, an<br>
instantaneous rate of change at a predetermined time or sample, or any other<br>
suitable analysis of rail pressure.<br>
[0041] For example only, the decay calculation module 06 may<br>
calculate the decay rate using the equation:<br>
P1 - P2<br>
Decay Rate = —	-<br>
 t<br>
where P1 is a first rail pressure, P2 is a second rail pressure, and t is a period of<br>
time between engine shutdown and P2. For example only, the first rail pressure<br>
may be measured when the engine 102 is shut down. Alternatively, the decay<br>
calculation module 06 may assume that the first rail pressure is the rail pressure<br>
maintained by the ECM 220 during normal engine operation.<br>
[0042] The decay calculation module 06 may calculate the decay rate<br>
by measuring the period of time between engine shutdown and a time at which<br>
the rail pressure falls below a predetermined pressure. This measured period<br>
and predetermined pressure may be t and P2, respectively, in the above<br>
equation. Alternatively, the decay calculation module 06 may calculate the<br>
decay rate by measuring the rail pressure after a predetermined period has<br>
passed after engine shutdown. This measured pressure and predetermined<br>
period may be P2 and t, respectively, in the above equation.<br>
[004 ] The fault diagnostic module 08 diagnoses faults in the high<br>
pressure side of the fuel system and generates the fault signal accordingly. For<br>
example only, the fault diagnostic module 08 may detect fault in the high<br>
pressure side of the fuel system when the decay rate exceeds a fault threshold.<br><br>
The fault threshold may be calibratable and may be set to a minimum decay rate<br>
at which the high pressure side is known to be faulty. For example only, the fault<br>
threshold may be set to 8 MPa/s.<br>
[0044] Alternatively, the fault diagnostic module 08 may diagnose<br>
faults in the high pressure side without actually calculating the decay rate. In<br>
various implementations, the fault diagnostic module 08 may detect fault in the<br>
high pressure side when the measured rail pressure after a predetermined period<br>
is less than a pressure threshold. In various other implementations, the fault<br>
diagnostic module 08 may detect fault in the high pressure side when the period<br>
of time between engine shutdown and a time at which the rail pressure falls<br>
below the predetermined pressure is less than a predetermined period.<br>
[0045] Referring now to FIG. 4, exemplary plots 402 and 404 both<br>
depict rail pressure versus time after engine shutdown for the high pressure side<br>
of various vehicles. Upon engine shutdown, the rail pressure begins decreasing<br>
from an operating pressure, such as 5.0 MPa. The decay rate of rail pressure<br>
may be calculated after measuring the period between engine shutdown and a<br>
time at which the rail pressure falls below a predetermined pressure (e.g., plot<br>
402) or after measuring the rail pressure at a predetermined period after engine<br>
shutdown (e.g., plot 404). The high pressure side of the fuel system may be<br>
faulty when the decay rate is greater than the fault threshold, which may be, for<br>
example, 8 MPa/s.<br>
[0046] Plot 402 depicts measuring the period between engine<br>
shutdown and a time at which the rail pressure falls below a predetermined<br><br>
pressure. For example only, the predetermined pressure may be .0 MPa, as<br>
represented by dashed line 406. The decay rate may then be calculated using,<br>
for example, the above equation, and faults in the high pressure side may be<br>
detected accordingly.<br>
[0047] Alternatively, faults in the high pressure side may be detected<br>
by comparing this measured period a predetermined period. For example only,<br>
when the fault threshold is 8 MPa/s and the operating pressure (Pi) is 5 MPa,<br>
the predetermined period may be approximately 4 seconds [i.e., ( 5 MPa - <br>
MPa) / 8 MPa/s]. Accordingly, the high pressure side may be faulty when the rail<br>
pressure falls below .0 MPa within 4 seconds after engine shutdown. Using<br>
these values, high pressure side diagnostic modules may detect fault in the high<br>
pressure side of the fuel systems indicated by reference numeral 408. High<br>
pressure side diagnostic modules may determine that the high pressure side of<br>
the fuel systems indicated by reference numeral 410 are likely reliable.<br>
[0048] Plot 404 depicts measuring the rail pressure after a<br>
predetermined period. For example only, the predetermined period may be 4<br>
seconds, as depicted by dashed line 412. The decay rate may then be<br>
calculated using, for example, the above equation, and faults may be diagnosed<br>
in the high pressure side accordingly.<br>
[0049] Alternatively, faults in the high pressure side may be diagnosed<br>
based upon a comparison of the measured rail pressure (after the predetermined<br>
period) with a pressure threshold. For the case where the fault threshold is 8<br>
MPa/s and the operating pressure is 5 MPa, the pressure threshold may be <br><br>
MPa [i.e., 5 MPa - (8 MPa/s * 4 s)]. Accordingly, fault may be detected in the<br>
high pressure side when the rail pressure measured 4 seconds after engine<br>
shutdown is less than MPa. For example only, fault may be detected in the<br>
high pressure side of the fuel systems indicated by reference numeral 408, while<br>
it is unlikely that fault will be detected in those indicated by reference numeral<br>
410.<br>
[0050] Referring now to FIG. 5, an exemplary graph depicts measured<br>
decay rates of the high pressure side of various fuel systems 500A-500J.<br>
Dashed line 502 indicates an exemplary fault threshold, which is 8.0 MPa/s in<br>
FIG. 5. Fault may be detected in the high pressure side of each of the fuel<br>
systems 500A-500J when its respective decay rate is greater than the fault<br>
threshold. As depicted, the high pressure side diagnostic modules<br>
corresponding to the fuel systems 500C, 500D, and 500H may detect fault in<br>
their respective high pressure sides.<br>
[0051] Referring now to FIG. 6A, a flowchart depicts exemplary steps<br>
performed by the high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0. Control begins in<br>
step 602 upon engine shutdown. In step 602, control starts the timer 02. In<br>
various implementations, control starts the timer 02 from a reset value, such as<br>
zero. Control continues in step 604, where control measures the rail pressure.<br>
[0052] In step 606, control determines whether the rail pressure is less<br>
than or equal to a predetermined pressure. If so, control continues in step 608;<br>
otherwise, control returns to step 604. For example only, the predetermined<br>
pressure may be .0 MPa. Control continues in step 608, where control<br><br>
measures the period. For example, control may measure the period by reading<br>
the timer 02, and calculating the difference between the reset value and the<br>
timer value.<br>
[005 ] In step 610, control calculates the decay rate, for example,<br>
using the equation:<br>
P1 -P2<br>
Decay Rate = —	-<br>
 t<br>
where P1 is the first rail pressure, P2 is a second rail pressure, and t is the period.<br>
For example only, the predetermined pressure and the period may be used as P2<br>
and t, respectively. The first pressure measured in step 604 may be used as P1-<br>
Alternatively, control may assume that Pi is the operating pressure maintained by<br>
the ECM 220.<br>
[0054] Control then determines whether the decay rate is greater than<br>
the fault threshold in step 612. If so, control continues in step 614; otherwise,<br>
control transfers to step 616. In step 614, control indicates that no fault has been<br>
detected in the high pressure side of the fuel system, and control ends. In step<br>
616, control indicates fault in the high pressure side of the fuel system, and<br>
control ends. Control may indicate fault in the high pressure side of the fuel<br>
system by, for example, setting the error code and/or illuminating the "check<br>
engine light."<br>
[0055] Referring now to FIG. 6B, a second flowchart depicting<br>
exemplary steps performed the high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 is<br>
presented. Control performs steps 602 to 608 as in FIG. 6A above. Instead of<br>
calculating the decay rate, control then continues in step 620 where control<br><br>
determines whether the period is greater than a threshold (i.e., a predetermined<br>
period). If so, control continues in step 622; otherwise, control transfers to step<br>
624. in step 622, control that no fault has been detected in the high pressure<br>
and control ends. In step 624, control indicates fault in the high pressure side<br>
and control ends.<br>
[0056] Referring now to FIG. 6C, a third flowchart depicts exemplary<br>
steps performed by the high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0. Control starts<br>
the timer 02 in step 602. In step 6 0, control determines a first rail pressure.<br>
Control may measure the first rail pressure upon engine shutdown or assume<br>
that the first rail pressure is the rail pressure maintained by the ECM 220 during<br>
normal engine operation. In step 6 2, control determines whether the period<br>
since engine shutdown (i.e., starting the timer) is greater than or equal to a<br>
predetermined period. If so, control continues in step 6 4; otherwise, control<br>
remains in step 6 2.<br>
[0057] In step 6 4, control measures a second rail pressure. Control<br>
then continues in step 6 6, where control calculates the decay rate based upon<br>
the first rail pressure, the second rail pressure, and the predetermined period. In<br>
step 6 8, control determines whether the decay rate is greater than the fault<br>
threshold. If so, control continues in step 640; otherwise, control transfers to step<br>
642. In step 640, control indicates that fault has not been detected in the high<br>
pressure side of the fuel system, and control ends. In step 642, control indicates<br>
fault in the high pressure side of the fuel system, and control ends.<br><br>
[0058] Referring now to FIG. 6D, a fourth flowchart depicting<br>
exemplary steps performed by the high pressure side diagnostic module 2 0 is<br>
presented. Control performs steps 602 and 6 0- 4 as in FIG. 6C. Instead of<br>
calculating the decay rate, control then continues in step 650 where control<br>
determines whether the second rail pressure is greater than a pressure<br>
threshold. If so, control continues in step 652; otherwise, control transfers to step<br>
654. In step 652, control indicates that no fault has been detected in the high<br>
pressure side and control ends. In step 654, control indicates fault in the high<br>
pressure side and control ends.<br>
