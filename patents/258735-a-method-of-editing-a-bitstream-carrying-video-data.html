METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TRANSFORM-DOMAiN VIDEO EDITING<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to video coding and. more particularly, to video editing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Video editing capability is an increasingly requested feature in video playing and/or capturing devices. Transitional effects between different video sequences, logo insertion and over-layering sequences are among the most widely used operations in editing. Video editing tools enable users to apply a set of effects on their video clips aiming to produce a functionally and aesthetically better representation of their video.<br>
To apply video editing effects on video sequences, several commercial products exist. These software products are targeted mainly for the PC platform. Because processing power, storage and memory constraints are not an issue in the PC platform today, the techniques utilized in such video-editing products operate on the video sequences mostly in their raw formats in the spatial domain. With such techniques, the compressed video is first decoded and then the editing effects are introduced in the spatial domain. Finally, the video is again encoded. This is known as spatial domain video editing operation.<br>
For devices with low resources in processing power, storage space, available memory and battery power, decoding a video sequence and re-encoding it are costly operations that take a long time and consume a lot of battery power. Many of the latest communication devices, such as mobile phones, communicators and PDAs, are equipped with video cameras, offering users the capability to shoot video clips and send them over wireless networks. It is advantageous and desirable to allow users of those communication devices to generate quality video at their terminals. The spatial domain video editing operation is not suitable in wireless cellular environments.<br>
	As mentioned above, most video effects are performed in the spatial domain in prior art. In the case of video blending (transitional effects for fading, etc) between two or more sequences, for instance, video clips are first decompressed and then the effects are performed according to the following equation:<br>
1<br><br>
	V(x.yt) = α,Vt(x.yt)+a2V2(x,yt)	(I)<br>
where V(x, y. t) is the edited sequence from the original sequences Vs (x.y,t) and V,(x,y,t). α1 and a2 are two weighting parameters chosen according to the desired effect. Equation (1) is applied in the spatial domain for the various color components of the video sequence depending on the desired effect.<br>
Finally, the resulting edited image sequence is re-encoded. The major disadvantage of this approach is that it is significantly computationally intensive, especially in the encoding part. Typical complexity ratio between generic encoders and decoders is approximately four. Using this conventional spatial-domain editing approach, all of the video frames coming right after the transition effect in the second sequence must be re-encoded.<br>
Furthermore, it is not unusual that editing operations are usually repeated several times by users before the desired result is achieved. The repetition adds to the complexity of the editing operations, and requires more processing power. It is therefore important to develop efficient techniques minimizing the decoding and encoding operations, functioning in the compressed domain, to perform such editing effects.<br>
In order to perform efficiently, video compression techniques exploit spatial redundancy in the frames forming the video. First, the frame data is transformed to another domain, such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain, to decorrelate it. The transformed data is then quantized and entropy coded.<br>
In addition, the compression techniques exploit the temporal correlation between the frames: when coding a frame, utilizing the previous, and sometimes the future. frames(s) offers a significant reduction in the amount of data to compress.<br>
The information representing the changes in areas of a frame can be sufficient to represent a consecutive frame. This is called prediction and the frames coded in this way are called predicted (P) frames or inter frames. As the prediction cannot be 100% accurate (unless the changes undergone are described in every pixel), a residual frame representing the errors is also used to compensate the prediction procedure.<br>
The prediction information is usually represented as vectors describing the displacement of objects in the frames. These vectors are called motion vectors. The<br>
2<br><br>
procedure to estimate these vectors is called motion estimation. The usage of these vectors to retrieve frames is known as motion compensation.<br>
Prediction is often applied on blocks within a frame. The block sizes vary for different algorithms (e.g. 8 x 8 or 16 x 16 pixels, or 2n x 2m pixels with n and m being positive integers). Some blocks change significantly between frames, to the point that it is better to send all the block data independently from any prior information, i.e. without prediction. These blocks are called Intra blocks.<br>
In video sequences there are frames, which are fully coded in Intra mode. For example, the first frame of the sequence is usually fully coded in Intra mode, because it cannot be predicted from an earlier frame. Frames that are significantly different from previous ones, such as when there is a scene change, are usually also coded in Intra mode. The choice of the coding mode is made by the video encoder. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a typical video encoder 410 and decoder 420  respectively.<br>
The decoder 420 operates on a multiplexed video bit-stream (includes video and audio), which is demultiplexed to obtain the compressed video frames. The compressed data comprises entropy-coded-quantized prediction error transform coefficients, coded motion vectors and macro block type information. The decoded quantized transform coefficients c(x.y.t), where x.y are the coordinates of the coefficient and t stands for time, are inversely quantized to obtain transform coefficients d(x, y, t) according to the following relation:<br><br><br>
where T--1 is the inverse transform operation, which is the inverse DCT in many compression techniques.<br>
If the block of data is an intra-type macro block, the pixels of the block are equal to.Ec, (x.y.t). In fact, as explained previously, there is no prediction, i.e.:<br>
R(x,y,x,t)=Ec(x,y,t).	(6)<br>
If the block of data is an inter-type macro block, the pixels of the block are reconstructed ,by finding the predicted pixel positions using the received motion vectors (∆x,∆y) on the reference frame R(x,y,t-1) retrieved from the frame memory. The obtained predicted frame is:<br>
  (7)<br>
The reconstructed frame is<br>
  (8)<br>
	In general, blending, transitional effects, logo insertion and frame superposition are editing operations which can be achieved by the following operation:<br>
  (9)<br>
where V(x,y.t) is the edited sequence from the N V(x,y,t) original sequences and t is the time index for which the effect would take place. The parameter (x,y,t) represents the modifications for introducing on V,(x,y,t) for all pixels (.x,y)at the desired time t <br>
For the sake of simplicity, we consider the case when N=2, i.e.. the editing is performed using two input sequences. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that all of the following editing discussion can be generalized to n arbitrary input frames to produce one edited output frame.<br>

For N=2. Equation (9) can be written as Equation (1):<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is mainly concerned with transitional effects between different video sequences, logo insertion and overlaying of video sequences while the sequences are in compressed format. As such, the editing effects are applied to the video sequences without requiring full decoding and re-encoding. Thus, the present invention is concerned with blending and logo insertion operations in video editing. Blending is the operation of combining or joining sequences, overlaying for the entire frames or part of the frames in the sequences. Logo insertion is the operation of inserting a logo, which can be an image or graphic at a particular area of the frames in the video sequences.<br>
Transition effect editing between two frames can be broken down to performing such operations between the corresponding macroblocks of these two frames. As explained above macro blocks in compressed video are of two types: Intra and Inter. Hence, we find four different combinations for applying editing effects between the macroblocks. We will present how to achieve the above effects with combinations of these macroblocks.<br>
In general, editing operations can happen on a video clip in a channel at one of its terminals. The edited video clip is outputted at the other terminal, as shown in Figure 3. Video editing operations can start at time I. From that time, the bitstream is modified in order to add the desired effects as described in the following.<br>
Blending of an intra block with an intra block<br>
This operation in spatial domain is performed as follows:<br><br>
For Intra frames, using the steps of earlier section , we have, <br>
	(10)<br><br>
For Intra frames, using the steps of the earlier section, and after taking the transform of the frame after special effects, the same operations can be formulated as follows in the compressed domain:<br>
  (11)<br>
The transform domain approach significantly simplifies the blending operations, as can be seen from Figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention for compressed domain solution to dissolve transitional effects for Intra frames. Both of the compressed bitstreams 100.100’ are partially decoded in the corresponding demultiplexing units 10 to obtain the quantized transform coefficients 110, 100’  or c(i.j). The quantized transform coefficients are inverse quantized in inverse quantization blocks 20 to obtain inverse quantized transform coefficients 120, or d2(i,j) and 120' or d2(i,j). Each of these coefficients d1(iI,j) and d2(i,j) are scaled with α (t) and α{t), respectively, in blocks 22 and 22' to become scaled coefficients 122, 122'. The resulting coefficients 122.122' are then summed by a summing device 24 to produce a weighted sum 124  (d12 or e(x,y) , see Equation 11). The weighted sum 124 is re-quantized in the quantization block 26 to produce quantized coefficients 126. or e{x,y). Finally the quantized coefficients 126 are sent to a multiplexing unit 70, which performs entropy coding and multiplexing with other required information to produce a valid compressed video bitstream 170.<br>
It should be understood that it is possible to combine the inverse quantization, scaling and quantization blocks or to combine the scaling and quantization blocks into a single coding block.<br>
This process is repeated for both luminance and chrominance components of the video bitstream.<br>
Blending of an inter block with an inter block.<br>
Inter-frames are reconstructed by summing residual error with the motion-compensated prediction,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
These transform coefficients e(x.y) are then quantized and sent to the entropy coder.<br>
Figure 5 demonstrates an embodiment of the present invention for compressed domain solution to dissolve transitional effects for Inter macroblocks with Inter macroblocks. As shown in Figure 5, the coding device 5' comprises two decoders, which are capable of decoding two compressed bitstreams 100,100' into decoded video sequences 132, 132'. Part of the decoders is similar to a conventional decoder for inter block decoding, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, the process of decoding the compressed bitstreams 100, 100' into the decoded video sequences 132.132' in the spatial domain can be carried out in a conventional fashion. However, the coding device 5' further comprises a number of processing blocks to produce special dissolve effects in an edited bitstream 170. in addition to the decoded video sequences 132, 132'.<br>
Similar to the process as shown in Figure 4, the quantized transform coefficients 110 or c(i,j) are inverse quantized in the inverse quantization blocks 20 to obtain inverse quantized transform coefficients 120’ or d2(i,j) and 120' or d2(j,j)- Each of these coefficients d(I,j) and d12(i,j) are scaled with α1 (I and α2 (t), respectively, in blocks 22. 22' to become scaled coefficients 122. 122'.The resulting coefficients are summed by a summing device 24. The summing result d(i,j) is denoted by reference numeral 124. Meanwhile, the predicted frames 136, or R1(x+∆x1, 1∆y1, t -1) and 136' or R2(x+∆x2. y-∆y2. t -1) are subjected to transform coding in the Transform blocks 38, 38'. Furthermore, using the motion-vectors of the first video-clip and the reconstructed frames of the second video-clip, a reference block 137 R2(x+∆x-y+∆y, t -1) is obtained through the Motion Compensation prediction block 36'. The reference block 137' is also subjected to transform coding by a transform block 39'. After the transform operations, transform coefficients 138. 138' and 139', respectively, of R1(x+∆x1.y+∆y1. t -1). R2(x+∆x2.y-∆y2, t –1) and R2(x+∆x1,y+∆y1-, t-1) are scaled with (α-(t-1) - α (t), α (t-1), and - α2(t). respectively. The scaled transform coefficients are then subtracted from d12(i.j) in the summing block 25. The final resulting coefficients 125 or e(i,j) are then quantized in the quantization block 26. Finally the quantized coefficients 126 are sent to a multiplexing<br><br><br><br>
16<br><br>
unit 70 which performs entropy coding and multiplexing with other required information to produce a valid compressed video bitstream 170.<br>
It should be understood that it is possible to combine the inverse quantization, scaling and quantization blocks or to combine the scaling and quantization blocks into a single coding block.<br>
This process is repeated for both luminance and chrominance components of the video bitstream.<br>
In typical applications, the above-described process can be further improved. For example, it is possible to allow only the selected transition frames to go through the method of producing edited bitstream 170, according to the present invention. For frames that are not transition frames, the operations can be skipped. This improvement process can be carried out by setting one of the weighting parameters in the above-described case to 0: α 1(t)=0 α1(t)=0 α2(t)=0. When α2 (t-1)=0, there is no need to compute the transform coefficients 138' of R2(x+∆x2, y+ ∆y2-t -1). Likewise, when α2(t-l )= 0, there is no need to compute 137'. or.R2(x+ ∆x1,. ∆y1(t-1). When α1-t(t-l)= α1(t). there is no need to compute the transform coefficients 138 of R1(x+∆x1+∆y1, t-1).<br>
When α2 (t-1)= α2 (t), the transform coefficients of R2(x+∆x2,y+∆y2-, t-1) and R2(x -∆x1, ∆y1,t-1) need not be computed separately in different coding blocks, but they can be computed as follows. After computing both R2(x+∆x2-y+∆y2. t-1) and R2(x+∆x2,y+∆y2,t-1). the block R2(x+∆x2.y+∆y2, t-1) is subtracted from R2(x+∆x1,y, ∆y1,t-1). The difference is subjected to transform coding in one of the transform blocks, such as the block 39'. The results are scaled by α2(t-1) or α2 (t), and the scaled result is fed to the summing block 25. The remaining steps are identical to the process as described in conjunction with Figure 5 above.<br>
Sliding Transitional Effect<br>
Sliding transitional effect, also known as “wipe” effect, makes one video clip slide into the other during transition. This can be accomplished by assigning appropriate weights a(x,y.,t) thai are dependent on the spatial location (x,y) in the frame. Furthermore, for the frames V1(x,y.,), we set weights a1(x,y,t) =0 and a1(x,y.t) - I in order to dictate which parts of frame 1 to be included in the sliding transition. Likewise, the setting a2(x,y,l) =0 and a2(x,y,t) = 1 dictates which parts of the frame are to be included in frame 2.<br>
17<br><br>
Logo Insertion<br>
Logo insertion can be accomplished in different ways. One way is logo insertion with blending, as shown in Figure 6. Alternatively, logo insertion can be carried out without blending, as shown in Figure 7.<br>
In logo insertion with blending, the transform coefficients 120 from one of decoder (see Figure 5) are replaced by the transform coefficients of the logo in a logo memory 40. as shown in Figure 6. As shown, the logo frames or sequence 140 is transformed into transform coefficients 141 by a transform block 41. The transform coefficient 141 and the coefficient 120 are summed by the summing block 24 after scaling. At the same time, the logo frames are processed by a Motion Compensation prediction block 36' to produce the predicated frames 137'. The result is transformed into transform domain coefficients 139’. The remaining steps are similar to those depicted in Figure 5.<br>
Logo insertion without blending is shown in Figure 7. As shown, the transform coefficients 141 are mixed with the inverse quantized transform coefficients 120 from the compressed bitstream 100 as well as the predicated frames based on the edited bitstream 126.<br>
Superposition of multiple sequences or frames<br>
In the above-described editing processes, the number of input sequences, or ,N. is set to 2 (Equation 1). Similarly, the number of frames, or n. for use in motion prediction is also set to 2. However, the method of transform domain editing, according to the present invention, can be generalized such that the number of frames can be extended from n=2 to N=2, with N being a positive integer larger than 2.<br>
The compressed-domain editing modules as shown in Figures 4 to 7 can be incorporated into conventional encoders and decoders as shown in Figures I and 2. For example, a conventional encoder 410 can be operatively connected to an editing module 5. 5’ or 7 of the present invention. As shown in Figure 8. the expanded encoder 610 has a switch to select which bitstream to be sent to a decoder. Without editing, the original bitstream 100 is sent. With editing, the edited bitstream 170 is sent. As such, the expanded encoder 610 can be used as a typical encoder, or it can be used for compressed-domain video editing.<br>
18<br><br>
Each of the editing modules 5. 5’ and 7 can also be incorporated in an expanded decoder 620 as shown in Figure 9. As shown, the decoder 420 can accept an original bitstream 100, or an edited bitstream 170 from the editing module 5. 5' or 7. As such, the expanded decoder 620 can be used as a typical decoder, or it can be used for compressed-domain video editing.<br>
The editing module 8 of Figure 6 can also be used along with a conventional decoder 420 in an expanded decoder 630. As shown, the decoded video sequences of the original bitstream 100 can be obtained directly from the upper part 6 of the editing module 8 (see Figure 6). Alternatively, the bitstream 100 can be edited by the lower part 5” of the editing module 8.<br>
The expanded encoder 610 can be integrated into an electronic device 710, 720 or 730 to provide compressed domain video editing capability to the electronic device, as shown separately in Figures 1la to 11c. As shown in Figure 1 a, the electronic device 710 comprises an expanded encoder 610 to receive video input. The bitstream from the output of the encoder 610 is provided to a decoder 420 so that the decoded video can be viewed on a display, for example. As shown in Figure 11 b, the electronic device 720 comprises a video camera for taking video pictures, The video signal from the video camera is conveyed to an expanded encoder 610, which is operatively connected to a storage medium. The video input from the video camera can be edited to achieve one or more video effects, as discussed previously. As shown in Figure 11c, the electronic device 730 comprises a transmitter to transmit the bitstream from the expanded encoder 610. As shown in Figure 1Id. the electronic device 740 comprises a receiver to receive a bitstream containing video data. The video data is conveyed to an expanded decoder 620 or 630. The output from the expanded decoder is conveyed to a display for viewing. The electronic devices 710, 720, 730, 740 can be a mobile terminal, a computer, a personal digital assistant, a video recording system or the like.<br>
It should be understood that video effect provided in blocks 22, 22', as shown in Figures 4. 5 and 6 can be achieved by software programs 422, 424. as shown in Figure 12. For example, these software programs have a first code for providing editing data indicative of a(x,y,t) and a second code for applying this editing data to the transform coefficients d(x,y,t) by a multiplication operation. The second code can also have a summing operation to combine the scaled transform coefficients 122. 122'. 142. Moreover, the summing operation in both the block 24 and the block 25 (see Figure 5 and<br>
19<br><br>
6) can be carried out by a software program 426 in a summing module 28, as shown in Figure 13.<br>
In sum. the present invention provides a method and device for editing a bitstream carrying video data in a video sequence. The editing procedure includes:<br>
- decoding the bitstream to obtain quantized transform coefficients of the video sequence:<br>
- inversely quantizing the quantized coefficients to obtain transform coefficients: modifying the transform coefficients in the transform domain;<br>
-	quantizing the modified transform coefficients.<br>
The transform coefficients can be modified by combining the transform coefficients with other transform coefficients by way of weighted summation, for example. The other transform coefficients can be obtained from the same video sequence or from a different video sequence. They can also be obtained from a memory via a transform module.<br>
Many or all of these method steps can be carried out by software codes in a software program.<br>
