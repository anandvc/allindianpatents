				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF POLYHYDROXYSTILBENE COMPOUNDS<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is a novel process of the synthesis of polyhydroxystilbene compounds.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a process for the synthesis of resveratrol and piceatannol.<br>
Polyhydroxystilbenes are compounds which are found in various plants and which have received particular attention because they exhibit a great variety of therapeutic properties.<br>
These derivatives include resveratrol (E-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and piceatannol (E-3,5,3',4'-tetrahydroxystilbene) of formulae:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Resveratrol and piceatannol are compounds belonging to the class of the polyphenols, which are known to exert antioxidant effects capable of preventing or delaying the detrimental effects of oxidative stress.<br>
In the therapeutic field, resveratrol is listed as platelet antiaggregant, antiinflammatory or vasodilator or as cell proliferation inhibitor.<br>
The majority of the routes used to produce polyhydroxystilbenes require the protection<br>
of the phenol functional groups in the form of ether derivatives. Protection is most generally obtained by methyl, methylene, isopropyl or benzyl groups. The synthesis of the polyhydroxystilbenes requires, lastly, a stage of deprotection in order to release the phenol functional groups. The stage of deprotection of the phenol ethers is generally easily carried out in the case of simple derivatives, such as anisole, with aluminium chloride, as in J.Chem.Soc. (1944), 330. However, this reaction is difficult in the case in particular of stilbene derivatives due to the presence of the double bond and more particularly when the molecule has activating groups (that is to say, electron-donating groups) on the aromatic rings of the molecule, such as ether groups. The use of strong acids, such as hydrobromic acid or aluminium chloride, the commonest and cheapest of the Lewis acids, results in significant decomposition of the molecule during these deprotection reactions. In the more specific case of benzyl ethers, deprotection is carried out by hydrogenolysis, which results, in the specific case of stilbene derivatives, in hydrogenation of the double bond.<br>
In order to overcome these disadvantages, in the case of these stilbene derivatives, use is generally made, in O-demethylation or O-debenzylation reactions, of boron tribromide, as in WO2003/086414, or boron trichloride in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide, as in Tetrahedron Lett., 44, 1 (2003), 193-98, and, in the specific case of isopropyl groups, boron trichloride alone, as in Tetrahedron, 59 (2003), 3315-21. However, BCI3, like BBr3, are expensive reagents which are dangerous to use industrially.<br>
Other reagents, such as methylmagnesium iodide, as in J. Org. Chem., 62, 2 (1997), 417-21, orpyridinium hydrochloride, as in J.Agric.Food Chem., 47, 10 (1999), 3974-77, use large amounts of reagents and severe reaction conditions (high temperature) for yields which are generally very mediocre.<br>
Some authors use aluminium chloride in pyridine as reagent and solvent in order to obtain resveratrol at temperatures of 165-170Â°C, as in Patent CN 1663939. However, in addition to very specific reaction conditions, this solvent is toxic and to be avoided for industrial use. It is the same for the reaction of Akiyama et al., specific for O-debenzylation reactions, which uses aluminium chloride and N,N-dimethylaniline as reagents and which is reported, for example in J. Med. Chem. (2003), 46 (16), 3547, for synthesizing in particular resveratrol and piceatannol. However, the aromatic amine is expensive, highly toxic and difficult to remove, rendering this method of little interest<br>
industrially.<br>
Considering that none of the solutions described above is truly satisfactory from an industrial viewpoint, the Applicant Company has looked for a method which is more suitable for the deprotection of alkoxy- or aralkoxystilbene derivatives, more particularly for the purpose of the synthesis of resveratrol and piceatannol.<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is thus a process for the synthesis of an (E)-stilbene derivative of formula (l)-(E) or a (Z)-stilbene derivative of formula (l)-(Z)<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention without having a limiting nature.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
56.2 g of triethylamine (555.4 mmol) are introduced into 20 ml of chlorobenzene in a three-necked round-bottomed flask. A nitrogen atmosphere is applied, the reaction medium is cooled to 0-5Â°C and 45 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride (337.5 mmol) are added in small fractions over 30 min. The medium is maintained at ambient temperature for 30 min with stirring and is then brought to 60Â°C, where this temperature is maintained for 1 h. 10 g of (E)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (37 mmol) dissolved in 20 ml of chlorobenzene are subsequently added in 1 h. The mixture is maintained at 60Â°C with stirring for 4 h and then at 80Â°C for 4 h. It is brought back to ambient temperature, separation by settling is carried out and the upper chlorobenzene phase is recovered. The lower phase is slowly added to 100 g of a 50/50 ice/water mixture. The medium is kept stirred for 1 h and is extracted several times with ethyl acetate.<br>
The combined organic phases are washed with water and concentrated to result in 7.6 g of (E)-resveratroi, i.e. a crude yield of 90%. The crude product is dissolved in ethanol at 60Â°C and resveratrol is precipitated by addition of water in order to obtain 6 g of precipitate exhibiting a melting point of 262-264Â°C.<br>
The proton and 13C NMR spectra are in agreement with the structure of (E)-resveratrol.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
4.5 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride (33.7 mmol) are introduced, under a nitrogen atmosphere, at ambient temperature and with stirring, into 10.37 g of tributylamine (56 mmol) in a three-necked round-bottomed flask. The medium is brought to 60Â°C and is maintained at this value for 4 h. 1 g of (E)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (3.7 mmol) is then introduced and the reaction medium is brought to 80Â°C for 2 h and to 100Â°C for 2 h. It is brought back to ambient temperature and then 10 g of a 50/50 water/ice mixture are added. It is maintained at 0-5Â°C with stirring for 3 h and extracted 4 to 5 times with 10 ml of methyl ethyl ketone. The combined organic phases are washed with 10 ml of a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and then with 10 ml of water. After concentrating the organic phase, an HPLC quantitative determination (external calibration) gives an (E)-resveratrol yield of 75%.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
4 ml of chlorobenzene and 6 g of triethylamine (59.3 mmol) are introduced into a three-necked round-bottomed flask. A nitrogen atmosphere is applied, the mixture is cooled to 0-5Â°C and 4.9 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride (36.7 mmol) are introduced in small fractions at this temperature. The medium is brought to 50Â°C and is maintained at this temperature for 1 h, and then 2 g of (E)-3,5,4'-tribenzyloxystilbene (4 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of chlorobenzene are added in 1 h at this temperature. This temperature is maintained for 4 h and then a temperature of 80Â°C is maintained for 4 h. The mixture is brought back to ambient temperature, separation by settling is carried out and the heavy phase is recovered and poured onto 20 ml of a 50/50 ice/water mixture. The medium is kept stirred for 2 h and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and then with water and then concentrated to result in 0.93 g of crude (E)-resveratrol, i.e. a practically quantitative yield with respect to the starting tribenzylresveratrol.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
4.5 ml of chlorobenzene and 15.7 g of triethylamine (155.1 mmol; 21 mol. eq.) are introduced into a three-necked round-bottomed flask. A nitrogen atmosphere is applied, the mixture is cooled to 0-5Â°C and 12.8 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride (95 mmol; 13 mol. eq.) are added in 30 min. The medium is brought to 60Â°C for 1 h. 2.2 g of tetramethylpiceatannol (7.3 mmol) dissolved in 4.5 ml of chlorobenzene are introduced at this temperature over 1 h and the reaction medium is maintained at this temperature for 4 h and then at 80Â°C for 4 h. It is brought back to ambient temperature, separation by settling is carried out and the heavy phase is recovered and hydrolysed by running dropwise onto 40 g of a 50/50 water/ice mixture. The mixture is kept stirred at this temperature for 1 h 30. The medium is extracted with 4 times 25 ml of methyl ethyl ketone and the organic phase is washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and then with water. 1.62 g of crude (E)-piceatannol are recovered in the form of a brown solid.<br>
The product is purified from a 5/95 mixture of methanol/water in order to result in piceatannol exhibiting a melting point of 233-34Â°C.<br>
The proton and 13C NMR spectra are in agreement with the structure of (E)-piceatannol.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
5 g of (E)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (18.5 mmol) are introduced into 20 g of triethylamine (197.6 mmol) in a 100 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask. The mixture is heated to 50Â°C under a nitrogen atmosphere and 16 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride (120 mmol) are added in small fractions over 30 min at this temperature. The reaction medium is then brought to 80Â°C for 2 h and then to 100Â°C for 2 h. It is cooled to approximately 75Â°C, 10 ml of anhydrous ethanol are slowly added and then, at this temperature of 75Â°C, 50 ml of water are added in 30 min. The reaction medium is then cooled to ambient temperature, at which it is maintained for 3 h, and the medium is extracted with 1 times 35 ml and 3 times 30 ml of methyl ethyl ketone. The combined organic phases are washed with 30 ml of water, then with 30 ml of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and with 30 ml of water. After concentrating the organic phases, 15 ml of absolute ethanol are added, the mixture is heated to reflux and then 46 g of water are added over approximately 1 h, still at reflux. The mixture is cooled down to ambient temperature and left stirring for 3 h. The precipitate is filtered off and washed on the filter with 9 g of a water/ethanol mixture (80/20 by weight).<br>
After drying at 40Â°C under vacuum for 24 h, 3.1 g of (E)-resveratrol are obtained, i.e. a yield of 73.4%.<br>
The HPLC and NMR analyses are in agreement with the structure of (E)-resveratrol.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
5.6 g of triethylamine (55.5 mmol) are introduced into 4 ml of methylene chloride. The medium is cooled to 0-5Â°C and 4.5 g of anhydrous aluminium chloride (33.5 mmol) are added in small fractions over 15 min with stirring and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction medium is subsequently brought to 50Â°C for 4 h. It is cooled and the solvent and the excess amine are concentrated at ambient temperature in order to obtain approximately 8.5 g of a slightly fuming pinkish solid formed of AICI3/triethylamine complex. 2 ml of chlorobenzene are added to the solid and the mixture is brought to 60Â°C. 1 g of 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (3.7 mmol) dissolved in 2 ml<br>
of chlorobenzene is added at this temperature over one hour. The mixture is maintained at 60Â°C for 4 h and then at 80Â°C for 2 h. The reaction medium is brought back to ambient temperature and then hydrolysed by addition of 10 g of a water/ice (50/50) mixture. The temperature is maintained at 0-5Â°C for 1 h and the medium is extracted several times with ethyl acetate. After concentrating the organic phases, the precipitate obtained is washed with 6 ml of chlorobenzene and dried under vacuum to result in 0.6 g of crude (E)-resveratrol.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
