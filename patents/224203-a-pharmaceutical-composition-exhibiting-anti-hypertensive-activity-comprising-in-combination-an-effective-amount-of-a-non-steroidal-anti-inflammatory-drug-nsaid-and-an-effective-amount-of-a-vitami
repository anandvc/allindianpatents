				<td>A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION EXHIBITING ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE ACTIVITY COMPRISING IN COMBINATION AN EFFECTIVE AMOUNT OF A NON STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG (NSAID) AND AN EFFECTIVE AMOUNT OF A VITAMIN B6<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and combinations, and uses thereof in medical treatment. More specifically, it relates to treatment of hypertension and to pharmaceutical compositions and combinations useful therein, especially treatment of hypertension in human patients on NSAID treatment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The occurrence of hypertension (elevated blood pressure) in the elderly is high. This is also the age group with a high incidence of arthritis. Osteo-arthritis is common after the age of 40. The presence of an inflammatory component to osteo-arthritis is now recognized. About 30% of patients with arthritis also have hypertension. Thus there is a considerable potential for the concurrent prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anti-hypertensives in the elderly population group. It is estimated that, in the United States, more than 20 million people are on concurrent anti-hypertensive and NSAID therapy. It is known that most anti-hypertensive agents are less effective in the presence of NSAIDs.<br>
In the past several years, there have been various reports of adverse effects of NSAIDs in patients receiving any form of anti-hypertensive medication such as (3-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. The hypotensive (blood pressure lowering) effect of [3-blockers is attenuated by the combined administration of NSAIDs such as indomethacin, sulindac and piroxicam. Significant attenuation of the hypotensive effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril by indomethacin, acetylsalicylate and<br>
sulindac has been reported. The antagonism by NSAIDs of the hypotenoive effects of diuretics such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide has also been reported. Naproxen and piroxicam have been reported to raise blood pressure of patients significantly during the concomitant use of drugs such as (5-blockers and diuretics. Most NSAIDs appear to reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of a variety of anti-hypertensive drugs, with the exception of the calcium channel blockers, which in any event have recently been reported to have other adverse side effects. Patients with renal impairment are at a risk of developing renal side effects when NSAIDs are used. In the elderly population suffering from various arthritic disorders, the potential adverse interaction between anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive drugs poses a significant problem. Treatments that maintain the anti-hypertensive action would be very beneficial to this age group.<br>

"Sympathetic Stimulation and Hypertension in the Pyridoxine-deficient Rat", Hypertension, Vol. 11, pages 387-391, 1988, reports work that shows that a moderate deficiency of vitamin B6 in rats causes hypertension which is reversed within 24 hours by the administration of vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine.<br>
U.S. Patent 4 , 374 . 841 reports that pyridine derivatives such as 4,5-dihydroxymethyl-3- [2-hydroxy-3 -(2-methylphenoxyethylamino)-propoxy] -2-methylpyridine and 4,5-dihydroxyethyl-3- [2-hydroxy-3- (2-methoxyphenoxyethylamino) -propoxy] -2-methyl-pyridine reduce the epinephrine- increased blood pressure in dogs.<br>
Some nutritional studies, namely Vanderiaat, D, J, a-nrj<br>

Ann. H. Y, Acad. Sci., Vol. 585, page 562-564, 1990, and Kok<br>
F.J.et .al "Low Vitamin -B6 Status in Patients with Acute<br>
Myocardial Infarction", Am, J, Cardiol, Vol. 63. pages 513-516, 1989, indicate that the elderly, may be at increased risk for developing a deficiency of vitamin B6.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide . novel pharmaceutical combinations which are "useful in treating hypertension in patients.<br>
It is a further and more specific object to provide combinations of NSAIDs with other pharmaceutical, which can be used for treating hypertension •without, seriatis loss of Che anti-iniflammatory activity of the HSAID.<br>
It is a further object to provide novel treatment &amp; of hypertension in patients sufferiog therefrom and -under NSAID treatment, -especially in adult human patients,<br>
SOMMARY... OF., THE.....INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based upon the discovery that vitamin Bs and derivatives thereof inhibit or relieve the attenuation of<br>
anti-hypertensive effect of anti-hypertensive drugs by NSAID's, Blood<br>
pressure in hypertensive mammals is significantly and rapidly reduced by administration to the patient of vitamin B6 or derivative supplement, Meta analysis of various studies indicates" that the ingestion. of NSAlDs attenuates the anti-hypertensive effect of a variety of anti-hypertensive drugs such as ß-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics, which reduces or even negates the usefulness of such<br>
drugs as anti-hypertensives when NSAIDs are also used.<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of alleviating hypertension in a mammalian patient who has hypertension under treatment by NSAIDs, which comprises administering to the patient an effective amount of a vitamin B6 supplement or vitamin B6 derivative supplement.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides a process of treating a mammalian patient in need of the beneficial effects of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) without causing excessive hypertension in the patient, which comprises administering to the patient an effective amount of an NSAID in conjunction with a vitamin B6 supplement or vitamin B6 derivative supplement.<br>
According to a further aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions for treating hypertension attenuated by NSAIDs in aged mammalian patients, comprising an effective amount of a vitamin Be supplement or vitamin B6 derivative supplement.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Since elderly human patients commonly suffer from osteo and rheumatoid arthritis or similar conditions for which NSAIDs are the recommended treatment, and since elderly patients commonly suffer from hypertension, the present invention is particularly suitable for use with elderly human patients, and this is its preferred application. Thus it is of particular significance under conditions (i) where the patient is ingesting anti-inflammatory drugs, including over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. for treatment of osteo or rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, and (ii) in age-related hypertension in the elderly. However, the invention is not so limited and provides beneficial effects for substantially all mammalian patients suffering from hypertension.<br>
The range of NSAIDs which can be beneficially included in the compositions and treatments according to the present invention is very wide, and extends to substantially all of the known NSAIDs currently available on the market. Specific NSAIDs which may be used in the present invention include diclofenac, indomethacin, the various anti-inflammatory acetylsalicylates (e.g. aspirin), sulindac, alclofenac, amfenac, piroxicam, naproxen, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, alminoprofen, ketorolac, GOBAB (3-amino-4-hydroxybutyric acid), amixetrine, diflunisal, mefenamic acid, phenylbutazone, tiaprofenic acid and tolmetin. Specifically preferred are diclofenac, indomethacin and the acetylsalicylates.<br>
The vitamin B6 derivatives contemplated for use in the present invention are those which are chemical modifications of vitamin B6, sometimes formed in the body as metabolites thereof, and having the same ring nucleus, for example pyridoxal-5-phosphate, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, 4-pyridoxic acid, etc.<br>
The vitamin B6 supplement used in the present invention is preferably pyridoxine in any of its pharmaceutically acceptable forms, such as pyridoxine hydrochloride addition salt. The amount of vitamin B6 compound or supplement used in the present invention is preferably from about 10 mg to about 500 mg, most preferably from about 50 to about 100 mg, per 70 kg of body weight of the patient, of vitamin B6 pyridoxine hydrochloride, or related compound acting as a vitamin B6 (or derivative) supplement, for administration on a daily or twice daily basis,<br>
to an adult human patient.<br>
The amount of NSAID administered to the patient, in the process of the invention, does not normally change from the prescribed dosage being used to treat the inflammatory condition in the absence of the vitamin B6 (or derivative) supplement. Thus, a patient taking a daily dosage of, say, 500 mg of naproxen to treat or alleviate an underlying inflammatory condition continues to take the same prescribed 500 mg thereof supplemented by vitamin B6 or derivative in the process of ' the invention?" Suitable prescribed doses vary widely according to the chose of " NSAID, the underlying conditions it is intended to alleviate, and factors concerning the individual patient. Generally appropriate dosage ranges may be found by consulting standard reference pharmacopeias, and thus are well within the skill of the art. As examples, indomethacin is commonly prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis at an oral dosage rate of 75-200 mg per day, in three separate doses per day. Diclofenac is commonly prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, at a daily oral dosage rate of 75-150mg, in three separate doses per day. Acetylsalicylates are generally administered in higher dosages, such as 650 mg, four to six times per day as necessary to alleviate the symptoms. The same NSAID dosage rates as prescribed, are continued in the process and formulations of the invention.<br>
A specific preferred embodiment of the present invention is a dosage form pharmaceutical composition for administration to patients requiring NSAID therapy, comprising in combination an effective amount of an NSAID and an amount of vitamin B6 (or derivative) supplement effective to alleviate the hypertensive effects of the NSAID. Such a formulation suitably takes the form of an orally administrable tablet or capsule, with<br>
appropriate inert, tablet forming ingredients. The amount of NSAID in such a tablet or capsule may be in the range of 25-1000 mg, depending . on choice of NSAID, condition to be treated, frequency of administration, etc. The amount of vitamin B6 (or derivative) supplement in such a tablet or capsule may be in the range 10-500 mg. Such a combined drug formulation provides effective therapy upon administration.<br>
Whilst it is most convenient and preferred to prepare and use compositions which comprise a combination of the NSAID and the vitamin B6 or derivaative, e.g. in a tablet or capsule form, along with suitable pharmaceutical carriers, diluents, excipients and the like, for oral administration, other methods of administration are within the scope of the present invention. For example, the active ingredients, namely the NSAID and vitamin B6 or derivative, may be administered separately and sequentially to the patient, and the combined or sequential administration may -be via the oral route, or alternatively parenterally, intramuscularly, . rectally, transcuta'neously or nasally. Formulations of the compositions of the present invention for such forms of administration are standard and within the skill of the pharmaceutical compounders art.<br>
Vitamin B6 is a known but not commonly prescribed anti-hypertensive agent, although not previously known to be effective in the presence of NSAIDs. A substantial advantage of its use is that it is known to be non-toxic and to lack side effects in the proposed human dosage of up to 600 mg/per son/day, having previously been so used, for example, in long term treatment of chronic anemia.<br>
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES<br>
Thefollowing specific examples further describe and illustrate the present invention and its use, but are not to be construed as limiting on the scope of the invention. They describe the invention in relation to its use on laboratory-animals, in accordance with approved practices. Laboratory rats, some having a moderate hypertension condition and some being normal, normotensive rats were used, taking measurements of their systolic blood pressure in acute and long term experiments using compositions according to the invention. The hypertensive rats were on a vitamin B6 deficient diet for 8-10 weeks prior to the experiments. They had a body weight of 200-225 g. The control normotensive rats weighed about 300 g.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - (Control)<br>
The time and dosage response of hypertensive rats to treatment with diclofenac was investigated.<br>
Vitamin B6 deficiency-induced hypertensive rats (prepared according to the procedures of Paulose et al., cited above) were used in acute experiments. They were injected with varying doses of diclofenac and the changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) were monitored by tail cuff plethysmography. In vitamin B6-deficient hypertensive rats (SBP, 150 mm Hg) , intraperitoneal injection of diclofenac sodium (dose, l mg/kg body weight) raised the SBP by 9 mm Hg in one hour after injection. A higher dose (3 mg/kg) elevated SBP by 28 mm Hgf which also occurred one hour after injection. A larger dose (10 mg/kg) caused an increase of SBP of similar magnitude but the effect lasted for 2 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - (Control)<br>
The effects of treatment with indomethacin on the SBP of hypertensive rats was investigated.<br>
The effect of varying doses (1 or 3 mg/kg body weight) of indomethacin on the SBP of hypertensive rats was examined by monitoring SBP tail cuff plethysmography following intraperitoneal injection of the drug or vehicle to the rats. Indomethacin (3 mg/kg) raised the blood pressure of hypertensive rats by 6 mm Hg within thirty minutes. The peak response (35 mm Hg) was reach by one hour. Although the effect declined by two hours, it was still elevated (15 mm Hg) and vehicle injected levels were reached only after three hours. A smaller dose (1 mg/kg) did not have any effect on the SBP of the hypertensive rat.<br>
In the following Examples 3, 4 and 5, the effects of oral administration of various NSAIDs up to seven days on the SBP of rats on a normal diet were examined. Older (chronological age) normal rats (400-600 g body weight) cn a commercial rat diet (chow) were used. These rats had a SBP of 145-150 mm Hg.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The effect of oral administration of a vitamin B6 supplement (2.5 or 5 times""the" daily"requirement) on SBP of older rats was examined. The rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 was continued on the same commercial rat chow ration. Group 2 was fed the same diet containing diclofenac (100 mg per kg diet) . Group 3 was fed the comnercial rat chow diet containing a vitamin B6 supplement (2.5 or 5 times the daily requirement for vitamin B6 i.e. 25 mq/kg and 50 mg/kg<br>
respectively) . Group 4 was fed diclofenac as in Group 2 but also had the vitamin B6 supplement in the same amounts. The animals consume about 15 grams of chow per day. The SBPs were determined on days 0 (6 hours after start of feeding), 1 and 7, at the same time (late afternoon) for each measurement. The results are given in Tables l(a) for 2.5 times vitamin B6 supplement and in Table 1 (b) for 5 times vitamin B6 supplement. In the Tables, each value is the mean ± S.E.M. of 5 rats. Body weight is indicated by B.Wt., systolic blood pressure by SPB and heart rate by HR. Table l(a)<br>
*P
*P
These results indicate that, even on day 1, vitamin B6 supplementation alone gives a significant decrease in SBP (Group 3 results in comparison with Group 1 results). Diclofenac alone had little effect (Group 2 results), but the combination of vitamin B6 supplement and diclofenac (Group 4) was most marked. Vitamin B6 supplement decreased the SBP of older rats. The effect was quite significant even when the rats were receiving diclofenac. The higher dose of vitamin B6 resulted in a larger effect. The effect of vitamin B6 supplementation was seen as early as one day after the treatment and was still seen one week after initiation of the supplementation regimen.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The experiments reported in Example 3 were essentially repeated using a different set of essentially the same animals, but substituting indomethacin at the same amounts, for diclofenac. Each experiment used 1.5 times vitamin B6 supplement. The results are given in Table 2, corresponding to the previous Tables. TABLE 2<br>
*P
These results are comparable to those reported in Table 1(a) .<br>
Vitamin B6 supplementation decreased the SBP of rats. This was quite significant in rats getting indcmethacin,in addition.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
In these experiments, the effects of the vitamin B6 supplement 2.5 times the daily requirement) on the SBP of the older rats on commercial rat ration but receiving acetyl salicylate (20 or 100 mg per kg. diet) in the diet were investigated. The experiments were conducted as described in Example 1. Different sets of essentially the same animals were used. Table 3 (a) reports the results with animals of four groups.<br>
Group 1 was fed normal chow. Group 2 was fed normal chow. Group 3 was fed chow with 2.5 x vitamin B6.<br>
Group 4 was fed chow with 2.5 x vitamin B6 plus acetylsalicylate (20 mg/kg diet). Each Value is the Mean +• S.E.M. of 5 rats.<br>
TABLE 3(a)<br>
*P
Table 3 (b) reports similarly the results of experiments in which the Group 2 and Group 4 animals received 100 mg/kg acetylsalicylate instead of 20 mg/kg - otherwise the experiments were the same.<br>
Table 3(b)<br>
*P
As in the previous experiments, vitamin B6<br>
supplementation decreased the SBP of these rates. The effects<br>
were most significant in rats receiving the anti-inflammatory<br>
drug.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The effect of diclofenac administration with and without co-administration of vitamin B6 was studied in young hypertensive rats as described in Example 3, but using a daily-dosage of diclofenac of 10 mg/kg and continuing the treatment for 60 days. As before, four groups of rats were used, each group comprising 6 animals. Group 1 received a normal commercial chow ration daily. Group 2 received the same chow ration daily, supplemented with the diclofenac. Group 3 received the same chow ration daily, supplemented with 25 mg/kg vitamin B6. Group 4 received the same chow ration daily, supplemented with both diclofenac and vitamin B6 at the aforesaid amounts. The results are given below in Table 4.<br>
n=6, P
The results reported in connection with these Examples lead to the conclusion that moderate vitamin B6 deficiency causes a modest hypertension in mammals. The administration (i.p.) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exacerbates the hypertension in acute experiments. Administration of vitamin B6 or a derivative thereof attenuates the hypertensive potential of the NSAIDs. In longer term experiments the oral administration of a vitamin B6 (or derivative) supplement to older mammals results in a significant decrease in the SBP of these mammals which were still receiving NSAIDs. The co-administration of vitamin B6 (or derivatives) and NSAIDs results in a significant decrease in the SBP of older mammals.<br>
