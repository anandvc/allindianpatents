DESCRIPTION<br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A PHENYLALANINE DERIVATIVE AND INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing novel phenylalanine derivatives. The present invention also relates to novel compounds useful as intermediates of the process.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Integrins participate in various In vivo functions through the binding to adhesion molecules classified into immunoglobulin super family, sialomucin family, and the like. Integrins are composed of subunits referred to as alpha (a) and beta O) subunits, and there have been identified sixteen a subunits and eight (3 subunits so far. The 0(4 subunit associates with the iJ^ or p, subunit, and forms cx^Pi and a^p, integrins, respectively, which are hereinafter referred to as "a^ integrin" collectively.<br>
It is known that a^ integrin is involved in various diseases through the adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) ,. vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) or connecting segment 1 (CS-1) on fibronectin. It is also known that, when adhesion of a^ integrin is inhibited by an anti-a^ integrin antibody, the symptoms of allergic bronchitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and the like are alleviated.<br><br>
It has been reported that there are compounds capable of inhibiting o:^ integrin-mediated cell adhesion and that they are useful in treatment of diseases related to a^ integrin-mediated cell adhesion (see, WO 01/12183 and W099/36393). However, those publications do not disclose compounds having a lower alkoxy-C^.j alkyl group at the 4'-position of biphenylalanine nucleus, and a process for preparing the same.<br><br>
wherein X^ is a halogen atom, X^ is a halogen atom, Q is a group of the formula -CHj- or -(CH2)2- and Y is a lower alkyl group, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which has excellent inhibitory activity against a^ integrin-mediated cell adhesion.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a compound of the formula (I):<br><br><br>
wherein the symbols are the same as defined above, removing the protecting group from the protected amino group, and if necessary, converting the resulting compound into a salt, to yield a compound of the formula (IV) :<br><br><br>
wherein the symbols are the same as defined above, and (3)  removing  the protecting  group  from the protected carboxyl group of the compound (II), and if necessary, converting the resulting compound into a pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable salt.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention will hereinafter be explained in more detail.<br>
The compounds used in the process of the present invention may be in the form of a salt so long as the reactions are not adversely affected. Examples of the salt include a salt with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid; a salt with an organic acid such as acetic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, toluenesulfonic acid or methanesulfonic acid; a salt with a metal such as sodium, potassium, calcium or alminium; and a salt with a base such as ethylamine, guanidine, ammonium, hydrazine, quinine or cinchonine. When the compounds used in the reactions are available in the free form, they can be converted into a salt in a conventional manner, and vice versa. (1)  STEP 1:<br>
The coupling reaction of compound (VI) with compound<br>
(V)	can be carried out in a suitable solvent in the<br>
presence of a catalyst and a base.<br>
The protecting group for the amino group of compound<br>
(VI)	can be selected from the amino protecting groups that<br>
can be removed easily under conventional conditions.<br>
Examples of such amino protecting groups include a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted aryl-lower alkoxycarbonyl<br>
groups (e. g., benzyloxycarbonyl group and p-<br>
nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group), a lower alkoxycarbonyl group<br><br>
(e. g., t-butoxycarbonyl group), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group, etc. Above all, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group is preferred and t-butoxycarbonyl group is most preferred.<br>
Examples of the protected carboxyl group of compound (VI)  include esterified carboxyl groups.   Specific and preferred  examples  of  the  esterified  carboxyl  groups include carboxyl group esterified with a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group, an aryl lower alkyl group  (e.g., benzyl group),  an aryl group  (e.g., phenyl group), and the like.  Preferred examples of the COjR moiety are a lower alkoxycarbonyl  group,  a  lower alkenyloxycarbonyl group, a lower alkynyloxycarbonyl group, an aryl lower alkoxycarbonyl group (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl group),    and    an    aryloxycarbonyl    group    [e.g., phenyloxycarbonyl group).   Above all,  a lower alkoxy¬carbonyl group is preferred and ethoxycarbonyl or methoxy-carbonyl group is most preferred.<br>
Examples of the leaving group include a halogen atom<br>
(e.g., chlorine atom, bromine atom, iodine atom), an<br>
alkanesulfonylo.xy group (e. g., methanesulfonyl group) a<br>
halogenoalkanesulfonyloxy	group	(e.g.,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group) and an arylsulfonyloxy group (e. g., p-toluenesulfonyloxy group). Above all, a halogen atom such as bromine atom and iodine atom, and a halogenoalkanesulfonyloxy ■ group such as trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group are preferred, and bromine atom and trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group are most preferred.<br>
The coupling reaction can be carried out under the conditions of Suzuki coupling reaction, making reference to.<br><br>
for example, (a) Synth. Commun. 11: 513 (1981); (b) Pure and Appl. Chem. 57: 1749 (1985); (c) Chem. Rev. 95: 2457 (1995); (d) J. Org. Chem. 57: 379 (1992); (e) Acta Chemlca Scandinavica 47: 221 (1993); (f) J. Org. Chem. , 60: 1060 (1995); and (g) Organic Letters,   3: 3049 (2001).<br>
Examples of the catalyst .include those used in the<br>
Suzuki coupling reaction {e.g., palladium or nickel<br>
catalysts) . Palladium catalysts such as palladium (II)<br>
catalysts [e.g.,- palladium acetate, palladium chloride,<br>
dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium,     etc.)	and<br>
palladium	(0)	catalysts	(palladium<br>
tetrakistriphenylphosphine, etc.) can be used conveniently. The palladium catalyst can be used in a catalytic amount, specifically in amount of 1-10 mole %, preferably 4-6 mole "o.<br>
In case that a palladium (II) catalyst which does not have ligands in its molecule, such as palladium acetate or palladium chloride, is used, it is preferable to add a phosphine or a phosphite to the reaction in order to facilitate the reaction. Examples of the phosphine include tritolylphosphine, triphenylphosphine, trimethylphosphine, triethylphosphine, etc., and examples of the phosphite include trimethylphosphite, triethylphosphite, tri(n-butyl) phosphit^e, etc. The phosphine or phosphite can be used in amount of 3-50 mole %, preferably 10-30 mole %.<br>

carbonate, etc.), alkali metal hydroxides (sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, etc.), and organic bases such as<br>
alkylamines (diisopropylamine, triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine,    etc.),	pyridines    (pyridine,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine,  etc.),  and  cyclic  amines  (1,8-<br>
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene,	1,4-<br>

The base can be conveniently used in an amount of 1.0-3.0 mole equivalents, preferably 1.5-2 mole equivalents.<br>
Any solvents are available so long as the coupling reaction is not adversely affected, and, for example, an organic solvent, water or a mixed solvent thereof can be used. Examples of preferred organic solvent include amides (e.g., dimethylformamide and W-methylpyrrolidone), aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene and toluene), ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and dioxane), alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol), and a mixture thereof.

The reaction can be carried out at a temperature of -20°C to 180"C, more preferably at room temperature to 120°C, most preferably at 50°C to 100°C.<br>
The deprotection method for removing the protecting group from the protected amino group is selected depending<br><br>
on the type of protecting group to be removed.  For example, the deprotection can be conducted by a method selected from the followings:<br>

The condensing agent can be selected from conventional<br><br>
on the type of protecting group to be removed.  For example, the deprotection can be conducted by a method selected from the followings:<br>
