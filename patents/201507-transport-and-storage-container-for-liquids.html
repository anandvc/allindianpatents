The invention relates to a transport and storage container for liquids. The container comprises a pallet-like bottom frame for an exchangeable inner container of plastic material having four sidewalls^ a bottom, and a top. A closable filling socket is formed as a part of the top. A tapping socket is formed as part of a lower portion of one of the sidewalls and is provided with a tap fixture. A latticework enclosure having horizontal and vertical rods of metal is provided for receiving the inner container, wherein the ends of the vertical rods are welded to lower and upper peripheral profiled edge sections.<br>
2.   Description of the Related Art<br>
When lateral sliding of a transport and storage container for liquids of the aforementioned kind, disclosed in European patent 0 370 307 Bl, on a container of the same kind positioned underneath occurs during transport or stacking, there is the risk that the corner and center legs of the upper container slide  inwardly off the upper profiled edge section, formed as a tube, of the latticework enclosure of the lower container. This has the results that the upper<br><br>
area of the latticework enclosure of the lower container is widened under the weight of the upper container filled with liquid so that the screw connections of the top bars extending diagonally across the top of the inner plastic container to the upper profiled edge section become detached, and the inner container as well as the welded connections of the upper ends of the vertical rods to the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure become damaged. Moreover, there is the possibility that during transport of the stacked containers, as a result of external impact and striking loads, the welding connections of the vertical rods with the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure will fail and the profiled edge section will become detached, partially or completely, from the vertical rods of the latticework enclosure so that in this way transport damage is caused on the containers.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the construction of latticework enclosure of the transport and storage container for liquids of the aforementioned kind with respect to an increased stacking and transport safety.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved in that:<br>
the upper flattened ends of the vertical rods of the latticework enclosure that are formed as hollow profiled sections are shaped to a wave profile having at least two welding projections;<br>
a double bar is formed on the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure that is embodied as a hollow profiled section, wherein the double bar extends peripherally and transversely to the vertical rods;<br>
wherein the double bar is shaped to'have an inner wave profile and an outer wave profile, wherein the two wave profiles engage one another;<br>
wherein the outer wave profile has formed grooves and wherein the inner wave profile forms at least two peripheral welding projection rims;<br>
wherein the upper ends of the vertical rods and the double bar of the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure are connected to form a cruciform joint<br><br>
by projection welding; and<br>
wherein the upper profiled edge section has a flat upper peripheral rim for supporting corner legs and center legs of a palette-shaped bottom frame of a container stacked on top.<br>
The transport and storage container for. liquids according to the invention has the following advantages.<br>
The flat upper peripheral rim of the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure (jacket) of the transport and storage container ensures a save support action for a container stacked on top of a container positioned underneath by means of its corner and center legs.  The wave profile formed in the double bar of the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure (jacket), having preferably three peripheral welding projections, and the wave profile of the flattened (compressed to a flat shape) upper ends, having at least two welding projections, of the vertical rods of the latticework enclosure that are embodied as hollow profiled sections ensures an optimal projection welding connection of the vertical rods and the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure with cruciform joints, wherein grooves that are formed in the outer wave profile of the double bar of the upper edge profile of the latticework enclosure, the double bar having an inner and an outer wave profile, enable an optimization of<br><br>
the pressing force of the welding electrodes.  The support<br>
rim, which is springy to a limited extent and is oriented<br>
away from the double bar at a slant inwardly into the upper<br>
profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure and is<br>
supported with its inner rim on the upper end of the vertical<br>
rods, will contact, under the stacking load of a container<br>
on stacked on top, across the entire width/the upper ends of the<br>
vertical rods so that the welding connections at the<br>
cruciform joints of the vertical rods and of the horizontal<br>
upper profiled edge sections of the latticework enclosure are<br>
not loaded by the stacking load; the stacking load that acts<br>
suddenly onto a container in the bottom position during<br>
stacking is buffered and, in this way, damage of the<br>
latticework enclosure is prevented.<br>
By connecting the flattened upper wave-shaped ends of the tubular vertical rods of the latticework enclosure to the pipe sections of the rods, by means of curved or arc-shaped portions that, under the stacking load of the container stacked on top, provide predetermined bending location that are elastic to a limited extent, the spring action of the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure is further improved so that impact loads during transport, caused by a container stacked on top as a result of uneven road surfaces and hard suspension of the transport device as well as driving vibrations of the transport device, can be<br><br>
buffered. Finally, by receiving the upper ends of the vertical rods in a peripheral groove-shaped portion of the upper profiled edge section of the latticework enclosure, it is prevented that the rods will become detached from the profiled edge section when the welding connections of individual rods to the upper profiled edge section are destroyed as a result of overloads because of an excessive outer impact or striking load, for example, when the transport and storage container drops from a great height.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a transport and storage container for liquids comprising a pallet-shaped bottom frame; a latticework enclosure connected to the bottom frame; wherein the latticework enclosure has horizontal and vertical rods of metal and a lower peripheral profiled edge section and an upper peripheral profiled edge section, wherein the vertical rods have upper ends welded to the upper peripheral profiled edge section and lower ends welded to the lower peripheral profiled edge section; an exchangeable inner container of plastic material having four sidewalls, a bottom, and a top, wherein a closable filling socket is formed as a part of the top and a tapping socket is formed as a part of a lower portion of one of the sidewalls and is provided with a tap fixture; wherein the inner container is received in the latticework enclosure; wherein the vertical rods are hollow profiled sections and the upper ends are flattened and shaped to a wave profile having at least two welding projections; wherein the upper profiled edge section is a hollow profiled section and is formed to have a double bar, wherein the double bar extends peripherally and transversely to the vertical rods; wherein the double bar is shaped to have an inner wave profile and an outer wave profile; wherein the inner and outer wave profiles engage one another; wherein the outer wave profile has formed grooves and wherein the inner wave profile forms at least two peripheral welding projection rims; wherein the upper ends of the vertical rods and the double bar are connected by<br><br>
projection welding to form cruciform joints; and wherein the upper profiled edge section has a flat upper peripheral rim for supporting comer legs and center legs of a pallet-shaped bottom frame of a container stacked on top.<br><br>
