CATALYTIC ADSORBENTS OBTAINED FROM MUNICIPAL SLUDGES,<br>
INDUSTRIAL SLUDGES, COMPOST AND TOBACCO WASTE AND PROCESS<br>
FOR THEIR PRODUCTION<br>
5 CROSS -REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos.<br>
60/715,788 filed September 8, 2005; 60/782,593 Filed March 14, 2006; and 60/801,545<br>
filed May 17, 2006. The entireties of the applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the formation of catalytic adsorbents formed from the<br>
pyrolysis of different types of sludges alone or in combination with composting materials.<br>
The sludges include municipal, industrial, waste oil and metal based sludges. The<br>
15 composting materials can include tobacco waste.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
Growing concerns about the environment has.resulted in the development of new<br>
. environmentally friendly technologies, new materials, and new ways to reduce and<br>
20 minimize wastes. One of the wastes produced by contemporary society in abundant<br>
quantity is municipal sewage sludge, often referred to as biosolids. Biosolids are a mixture<br>
of exhausted biomass generated in the aerobic and anaerobic digestion of the organic<br>
constituents of municipal sewage along with inorganic materials such as sand and metal<br>
oxides. Other sludges include wastes from such industry as shipyards, foundry, or paper<br>
25 mills. It is estimated that about 10 million dry tons of sewage sludge is produced in the<br>
United States. Moreover, Sweden alone contributes 220,000 dry tons of sludge to the 8-10<br>
million tons of dry sludge produced by European Union.<br>
Various methods have been used to dispose of or utilize municipal sewage sludge,<br>
including incineration, landfilling, road surfacing, conversion to fertilizer, compression into<br>
30 building blocks, and carbonization. Since 1976, several patents have been issued on<br>
carbonization of sewage sludge and various applications of the final materials.<br>
Carbonization of sludge in the presence of chemical activating agents such as zinc chloride<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
and sulfuric acid produces new sorbents, with patented applications in processes such as<br>
removal of organics in the final stages of water cleaning and removal of chlorinated<br>
organics. Industrial sludges after dewatering processes/drying are ether used as landfills or<br>
disposed mainly as hazardous wastes.<br>
Carbonization of sludge to remove pollutants either from gas of liquid phase, is<br>
based on the fact mat typically activated carbons are chosen. This is owing to their large<br>
surface area and high volume of pores. Often, these characteristics of activated carbons are<br>
not potent enough to retain certain molecules, especially small ones, for which the<br>
dispersive interactions with the carbon surface are rather weak. In such cases, the carbon<br>
surface has to be modified to impose the specific interactions. These interactions include<br>
hydrogen bonding, complexation, acid/base reactions or redox processes. Fortunately, in<br>
the case of carbons, various technologies leading to modified surfaces exist and are<br>
relatively easy to achieve. Examples are oxidations with various oxidants such as strong<br>
acids, ozone, or air, impregnation with catalytic metals or reducing/oxidizing compounds,<br>
heat treatment in the presence of heteroatom sources such as chlorine or nitrogen<br>
compounds, and others.<br>
As a result of the treatments mentioned above, new functional groups/chemical<br>
species are introduced to the surface. They impose the specific and/or chemical<br>
interactions with the species to be removed. To have the removal process efficient, the<br>
chemical state of these species and their dispersion on the surface are important issues.<br>
Another important challenge is preservation of carbon porosity which is a crucial asset for<br>
the retention/storage of pollutants. Thus, the surface modifications can be done in such a<br>
way in which a niinimal decrease in the surface area/pore occur.<br>
Taking into account the above requirements, in some cases modifications of a<br>
carbon surface, besides being a challenge, can also be associated with high expenses,<br>
especially when noble or catalytic metals are involved. Industrial sludges, as those coming<br>
from shipyards or other heavy metal industries, are rich in catalytic transition metals. By<br>
pyrolysis of these materials, not only the volume of waste is reduced but those<br>
environmentally detrimental wastes can be recycled and converted into valuable products.<br>
These products, when used, can be safely disposed since the leaching of materials is<br>
significantly reduced by mineralization of those metals via high temperature solid state<br>
reactions.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
The process of carbonization of sewage sludges has been studied in detail previously<br>
and it is described in the literature. Materials obtained as a result of the treatment have<br>
surface areas between 100 and 500 m2/g. Their performance as adsorbents of hydrogen<br>
sulfides, sulfur dioxide, basic or acidic dyes, phenol or mercury has been reported as<br>
comparable or better that that of activated carbons. In many process the excellent sorption<br>
ability of these materials is linked to the catalytic action of metals present in various forms<br>
in the final products. Their chemical forms along with the location on the surface were<br>
reported as important factors governing the pollutant removal capacities. In some case the<br>
wastes were mingled and, owing to the synergy between the components, more efficient<br>
adsorbents were obtained.<br>
Adsorbents obtained by pyrolysis of sludge can be considered as complex<br>
pseudocomposite materials. However, the process of carbonization of biosolids has been<br>
studied in detail previously and it is described in the literature. It has been recently shown<br>
that by simple pyrolysis of municipal sewage sludge derived fertilizer, Terrene",<br>
exceptionally good adsorbents for removal of sulfur containing gases can be obtained. The<br>
removal capacity is twice that of coconut shell based activated carbon. Although, it was<br>
attributed to the specific combination of inorganic oxides of such metals as iron, copper,<br>
zinc or calcium. The predominant influence of inorganic phase or combination of oxides,<br>
which are also quite commonly used as catalysts for hydrogen sulfide oxidation or sulfur<br>
dioxide adsorption, was ruled out on the bases of the performance of a pure inorganic phase<br>
in die removal of sulfur containing gases. The capacity of pure inorganic phase heated at<br>
950°C was negligible. The data also showed that the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide occurs<br>
until all micropores (mainly about 6 A in size), likely within carbonaceous deposit or on the<br>
carbon/oxide interface, are filled with the reaction products. The form of that<br>
carbonaceous deposit is important and that deposit may play a role in adsorption capacity.<br>
The products of oxidation immobilized on the surface are stored there. Table 1<br>
shows the capacity of sewage sludge derived materials as adsorbents of sulfur containing<br>
gases. For removal of a toxic gas containing reduced sulfur the capacity is much greater<br>
than that of activated carbons. It happens in.spite of the fact that the carbon content is<br>
small (about 20%) and pore volume much smaller than that of carbons.<br>

SC-800	23.6	22.2<br>
SC-950	82.6	29.8<br>
S208	48.8	48.2<br>
Since pore volume seems to be a limiting factor for the capacity of sewage sludge<br>
derived materials, an increase in the content of carbonaceous deposit and pore volume with<br>
mamtaining the desired content of a catalytically active phase seems to be the desired<br>
direction of feature research. Resent studies showed that the pore volume active in the<br>
removal of such compounds as hydrogen sulfide does not need to be in pores similar in size<br>
to adsorbent molecule. Since the catalytic oxidation is the predominant mechanism of<br>
adsorption, the larger pores, (meso- and macropores) where the product of oxidation is<br>
stored were found to be beneficial.<br>
Another important factor is the chemistry of a catalytic phase, its dispersion,<br>
location on the surface, compatibility with the carbon phase and the effects of both phases<br>
on the removal process (adsorption/catalytic oxidation/storage). It was found that excellent<br>
capacity of an expensive desulfurization catalyst, US Filter carbon Midas*, is linked to the<br>
presence of calcium and magnesium oxides dispersed within the microporous activated<br>
carbon. On this catalyst, hydrogen sulfide is oxidized on basic centers of alkali earth metal<br>
oxides and sulfur is formed. The fact that this carbon is able retain up to 60 wt % sulfur is<br>
linked to a limited reactivity of MgO and CaO. On their surface, due to the basic pH and<br>
the presence of moisture, sulfur is formed and owing to the close proximity of the carbon<br>
phase, that sulfur migrates to the high-energy adsorption centers, small pores. In this way<br>
the catalytic centers are renewed and the adsorbents works until all small pores are filled by<br>
sulfur.<br>
Sewage sludge based materials were also found as efficient adsorbents for removal<br>
of mercury from waste water and copper. Other common industrial pollutants which can<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
be efficiently removed using those materials are basic and acidic dyes. In the case of these<br>
adsorbates the high capacity is linked to surface chemical nature (acidic and basic sites) and<br>
relatively large pores which are similar in size to the molecules of organic dyes.<br>
At high temperature, the organic matter vaporizes, dehydrogenation occurs and<br>
carbon can be deposited back on the surface of an inorganic support as carbon nanotubes of<br>
filaments. This may happen due to the presence of highly dispersed catalytically active<br>
metals. Since this process resembles the chemical vapor deposition (CVD), it is referred to<br>
as the self-imposed chemical vapor deposition (SICVD). The process of carbon nanotube<br>
growth on the catalysts containing nickel or cobalt is well-known and described in the<br>
literature. The nanotubes and carbon filaments grow on metal "seeds" and their effective<br>
size depends on the sizes of the seeds. Introduction of more carbon phase can increase the<br>
porosity leading to more space for storing of oxidation products and also can lead to the<br>
formation of greater quantity of novel carbon entities in the process of CVD. Figure 1<br>
shows an SEM image of carbon nanotubes grown on the surface of sewage sludge-derived<br>
materials.<br>
The carbon and nitrogen content of the sludge plays a role in the formation and<br>
properties of the adsorbent. While municipal sewage sludge is a promising material to use<br>
as a base with other waste sludges, other carbon or nitrogen based wastes can also be used.<br>
Besides formation of new carbon entities in the presence of catalytic metals as a result of<br>
heat treatment the new spinel-like/mineral like active components can be formed. Recently,<br>
for some sewage sludges containing iron and calcium the catalytically important entities<br>
were identified as dicalcium ferrite (Ca2Fe20s).<br>

Waste oil sludge, waste metal sludge (both from a shipyard, but the origin of the<br>
sludges can be from any heavy industry facilities where transition metals such as iron, zinc,<br>
copper, nickel, chromium are used) were mixed with municipal sewage sludge at different<br>
proportions then pyrolyzed in the nitrogen atmosphere at 650°C and 950°C for two different<br>
time periods (half an hour and an hour). Additional samples were pyrolyzed in the nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at a low temperature, e.g., about 600°C, 625°C, 650°C, 675°C, or 700°C or<br>
less, and at a high temperature, e.g., about 900°C, 925°C, 950°C, or 975°C, 1,000°C,<br>

not domestic wastewater sludge. This includes wastewater sludge from manufacturing or<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
processing of raw materials, intermediate products, final products or other activities that<br>
include pollutants from non-domestic wastewater sources. "Municipal" or "domestic"<br>
wastewater sludge can be generated at plants servicing the general population and may<br>
conform to the "10 State Standards."<br>
Combinations of compost/compost materials and municipal/industrial sludge, along<br>
with pyrolyzation in a nitrogen atmosphere, can lead to formation of new adsorbents. The<br>
new adsorbents can consist of an inorganic phase (70-95% and 80-98%) and a<br>
carbonaceous phase (5-30% and 10-30%). The inorganic phase can contain highly<br>
dispersed catalytic metals such as iron, nickel, copper, zinc, chromium, and calcium and<br>
magnesium oxides, alumina, silica, etc.<br>
As a result of synergy, a ceramics/mineral-like phase is formed. This phase reacts<br>
with nitrogen gas when exposed to elevated temperatures. The specific surface areas are<br>
about 10 m2/g to about 200 m2/g. For example, the specific surface areas may be about 10<br>
m2/g, 20 m2/g, 30 m2/g, 40 m2/g, 50 m2/g, 60 m2/g, 70 m2/g, 80 m2/g, 90 m2/g, 100 m2/g,<br>
110 m2/g, 120 m2/g, 130 m2/g, 140 m2/g, 150 m2/g, 160 m2/g, 170 m2/g, 180 m2/g, 190<br>
m2/g, 200 m2/g, or greater. The specific pore volumes are about 0.002 crnVg to about<br>
0.074 m2/g. For example, the specific pore volumes are about 0.002 cm3/g, 0.005 m2/g,<br>
0.015 m2/g, 0.025 m2/g, 0.035 m2/g, 0.045 m2/g, 0.055 m2/g, 0.065 m2/g, 0.074 m2/g, or<br>
greater. An important aspect of the texture is a significant volume of mesopores reaching<br>
about 0.8 cm3/g. All materials have basic pH, e.g., a pH over 9. They are capable of<br>
adsorbing up to about 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 wt % of hydrogen sulfide, mainly as elemental<br>
sulfur.<br>
The discovered solid state reactions form ceramics/mineral like crystallographic<br>
phases. Spinel-like compounds can form when municipal/industrial sludge is pyrolized at<br>
950°C, such as wurtzite (ZnS), ferroan (Ca2(Mg, Fe)5(SiAl&gt;022(OH)2), chalcocite (CUI.MS),<br>
spinel (MgAkOt), and feroxyhite (FeO(OH)) were found. In waste oil-based materials<br>
besides metallic iron, bornite (CusFeS-i), hibonite (CaAluOw), zincite (ZnO), ankerite<br>
(Ca(Fe, Mg)(C03)2) are present. In metal sludge based adsorbent aluminum, metallic iron,<br>
copper, zinc, pyrope (Mg3Al2(Si()4)3), perrohotite (Fe7Ss), Chalocopyrite (CuFeS2), Triolite<br>
(FeS) and Fersilicite, (FeSi) exist. Mixing industrial sludges with compost or compost<br>
materials can result in synergy enhancing the catalytic properties which can be linked to<br>
formation of new entities such as sapphirine (Mg3.5Al9Si1.5O20), maghemite (FeaCh),<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
cohenite (FeaC), lawsonite (CaAkSi207(OH)2H20), smithsonite (ZnCOs), sphalerite (ZnS),<br>
and hematite (Fe203).<br>
The new entities can be formed during pyrolysis that react with nitrogen gas when<br>
exposed to elevated temperatures (200-600 °C). This can result in an increase in weight<br>
between 0-3%. Some of these entities can be nitrides. The specific surface areas and total.<br>
pore volumes of the adsorbents are between 10-210 m2/g and 0.15-0.85 cm3/g, respectively.<br>
An important aspect of the texture can be a significant volume of mesopores reaching 0.8<br>
cm3/g (between 0.14-0.77 cm3/g). All materials have basic pH between 7-12. They are<br>
capable to adsorb up to 30 wt % of hydrogen sulfide mainly as elemental sulfur. Exposure to<br>
hydrogen sulfide and deposition of sulfur results in an increase in the volume of mesopores<br>
up to 25% as a result of formation of new pore space in-between deposited sulfur in large<br>
pores. The important components besides alkaline earth metals and transition metals are iron<br>
oxides and hydoxyoxides (but not only) since they contribute to oxidation of hydrogen<br>
sulfide to elemental sulfur. The developed materials are also good adsorbents of cationic or<br>
ionic dyes and heavy metals (up to 80 mg/g copper and up to 130 mg/g dyes). The spinel-<br>
like phase formed during pyrolysis contributes to cation exchange, complexations and<br>
precipitation reactions. During these reactions only small quantity of calcium and zinc is<br>
released to the solution as a result of a cation exchange process.<br>
The present invention uses the combination of compost and/or compost materials<br>
and municipal and/or industrial waste sludge to form adsorbents. Successful results used<br>
fertilizer and municipal sludge to create adsorbents, because they contain, in part, large<br>
amounts of carbon and nitrogen. Other wastes are available that are rich in carbon and<br>
nitrogen to use as a base material. One waste is compost and compost materials. Compost<br>
materials can be divided into two categories, "brown" - high in carbon, and "green" - high<br>
in nitrogen.<br>
Brown compost materials can be fall leaves, spent plants, straw and hay, pine<br>
needles, small twigs and wood chips, sawdust and woodshavings, shredded newspaper, egg<br>
shells, corncobs, bread and grains, wood ashes, old potting soil, food-soiled paper towels<br>
and napkins, dried flowers, brewery waste, hops, and pomace, food-soiled cardboard<br>
(recycle if clean, but compost if dirty), stale flour, cereal, spices, beans, nutshells, meat<br>
and fish scraps.<br>
Green compost materials can be fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds and<br>
filters, tea bags, fresh leaves, green plants, prunings and hedge trimmings, grass clippings,<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
weeds, flower bouquets, seaweed, feathers, horse manure, manure and bedding from small<br>
pets such as hamsters and rabbits, cornstarch and other organic packing materials, and<br>
spoiled juice.<br>
Additionally, over 70,000 tons of tobacco waste is generated every year during the<br>
production of cigarettes. In India alone, over 20 years ago, almost 100,000 tons of tobacco<br>
waste was generated, and more is generated every year. Tobacco waste is currently used as<br>
a compost material and fertilizer. Tobacco waste spans the entire cigarette making process<br>
from growing and harvesting to final production. The types of wastes generated during<br>
pre- and post- harvest practice of tobacco include suckers, stems, mid ribs, leaf waste and<br>
dust. For example, green trimmings are generated as the either the stalks and/or leaves are<br>
harvested and separated from their stalks for curing. After curing, certain varieties of<br>
tobacco are threshed (by separating the midrib of the leaf) generating particle waste and<br>
stalks can also be removed at this stage, depending on the type of tobacco. Stems are<br>
removed from the cured and aged tobacco and the leaves and stems are chopped and<br>
blended. Tobacco dust can be formed during the chopping and blending stages. Further<br>
dust can be generated as the chopped tobacco is formed into tobacco rods and finally<br>
wrapped into paper. Some chemical characteristics of tobacco waste are listed in Table 2.<br>

The use of compost and/or compost material was determined from studies using<br>
combinations of municipal sewage sludge and industrial sludge and municipal sludge and<br>
waste paper. The waste paper is used for its high carbon content. The paper was ground<br>
fine and added to the sludge. Compost materials can be ground like the paper and tobacco<br>
dust is in particulate/powder form. Sawdust is another compost material that is already in<br>
particulate/powder form. Sawdust is a brown compost material that is high in carbon.<br>
Wood char/ash can also be used based on its carbon content.<br>
The invention can combine the compost/compost materials with industrial sludge or<br>
with a mixture of municipal and industrial sludge. The compost/compost materials can be<br>
wetted as it is mixed, or may contain enough natural moisture to be mixed directly. The<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Industrial sludges such as waste oil sludge and metal sludge can be utilized using<br>
pyrolysis to produce new catalytic adsorbents. An important result of mixing is an<br>
enhancement in the properties of the above-mentioned sewage sludge-based adsorbents.<br>
Although only waste oil sludge can lead to adsorbents with an exceptional ability for<br>
desulfurization with 30 wt % removal capacity, the presence of sewage sludge is an<br>
economically feasible method of utilizing this abundant material.<br>
Mixing the sludge and their pyrolysis resulted in the enhanced properties compared<br>
to the physical mixture of pyrolized single components. Figures 2A and 2B show the<br>
comparison of the volumes of pores measured and predicted for the physical mixture of<br>
waste oil sludge (WO), sewage sludge (SS) and metal sludge (MS). The generally observed<br>
trend indicates that mixing sludges results in the development of an additional pore volume.<br>
That pore volume, especially mesopores, was identified as one of the factors governing the<br>
adsorption capacity. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the EbS removal capacity on the<br>
volume of mesopores. Since the analysis of materials pH and thermodesorption indicated<br>
elemental sulfur as an oxidation product, only mesopores can store such amount of sulfur as<br>
found from H2S breakthrough capacity tests (up to 30 wt%).<br>
Besides porosity, surface chemistry is also altered during pyrolysis of the sludge<br>
mixture as compared to the single components. Figure 4 shows the comparison of the<br>
measured and predicted capacity based on the performance of the individual components<br>
assuming the physical mixture. The huge enhancement found, reaching 100%, is the result<br>
of changes in the composition and the surface distribution of an inorganic phase. The<br>
sludges studied contain iron, copper, nickel, zinc, calcium, chromium and other metals in<br>
significant quantities. Their high temperature reaction in the presence of carbon phase can<br>
lead to unique spinel/mineral- like components active in the oxidation reactions.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an increase in the mass of the sample obtained by high<br>
temperature pyrolysis. Figure 5 shows DTG curves in nitrogen for selected adsorbants for<br>
initial and H2S exposed samples (E). The phenomenon was not observed for the samples<br>
pyrolized at low temperature. While not intending to be bound by theory, the increase may<br>
be a result of nitride formation. It was found the certain ceramic materials, when exposed<br>
to nitrogen in the presence of char, are able to form nitrides. Formation of these ceramics<br>
can be crucial for catalytic performance.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
Although the best adsorbents are obtained at about 650°C, the synergy is the most<br>
predominant at about 950°C when a mineral like/ceramic phase is formed. Moreover, an<br>
increase in the mass of samples under nitrogen at about 600°C indicates that ceramic<br>
components of adsorbents form nitrides in the presence of carbon. Figure 6 illustrates<br>
DTG curves in nitrogen for selected adsorbants for initial and H2S exposed samples (E).<br>
Those ceramics must be active in the process of H2S adsorbents since an increase in mass<br>
significantly decreased after exposure to hydrogen sulfide and water. The surface of<br>
adsorbents treated at about 950°C has very low affinity to retain water (hydrophobic).<br>
Temperature has also an effect on the density of the final products, which varies from about<br>
0.25 at 650°C to about 0.50 at 950°C.<br>
As mentioned above, unique compounds exist as crystallographic phases and they<br>
consist of metals such as calcium, magnesium, alumina, copper, iron, zinc and nonmetals<br>
such as oxygen sulfur, carbon and silica. The level of mineralization increases with an<br>
increase in the pyrolysis temperature and time. Higher temperature results in formation of<br>
two component metal-nonmetal crystallographic compounds with metals at low oxidation<br>
states. Figures 7A and 7B show the changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern for samples<br>
obtained at different temperatures. Figure 7A illustrates the X-ray diffraction pattern at<br>
650°C and Figure 7B is at 950°C.<br>
Advantages of the present invention include the fact that the sorbents obtained from<br>
industrial sludge have five times higher capacity for hydrogen sulfide removal than<br>
unmodified carbons. Their capacity is comparable to that of caustics impregnated carbon<br>
used worldwide as hydrogen sulfide adsorbents in sewage treatment plants. Furthermore,<br>
the kinetics of the removal process are very fast and no heat is released. Moreover, during<br>
adsorption, H2S reacts with inorganic matter and is oxidized to elemental sulfur. The<br>
product is environmentally inert. Importantly, the pH of the spent material is basic, so it<br>
can be safely discarded. Only small amounts of SO2 are released. Another advantage of<br>
the invention is that, since the sorbents are obtained from waste sludge, the significant<br>
amount of industrial and municipal waste can be recycled and reused in sewage treatment<br>
plants. The sorbents can be also used in desulfurization of gaseous fuels (for fuel cell<br>
applications) and in hydrothermal vents. The sorbents find another environmental<br>
application in removal of mercury from waste water. Furthermore, there is the possibility<br>
of regeneration of spent materials using heating to about 300°C to remove elemental sulfur.<br>

Example 1<br>
The homogeneous mixtures of waste sludges were prepared as listed in Table 3 and<br>
dried at 120°C. The dried samples were then crushed and pyrolized in a horizontal furnace<br>
at 950°C for 30 min. The temperature ramp was 10 degrees/minute. An inert atmosphere<br>
was provided by 10 ml/min. flow of nitrogen. The yields, ash content and densities of<br>
materials are listed in Table 3.<br>

The performance of materials as sorbents for hydrogen sulfide was evaluated using<br>
lab developed breakthrough tests. Adsorbent samples were packed into a column (length 60<br>
mm, diameter 9 mm, bed volume 6 cm3) and pre-humidified with moist air (relative<br>
humidity 80% at 25°C) for an hour. The amount of adsorbed water was estimated from the<br>
increase in the sample weight after pre-humidification (the sorbents were removed from the<br>
column and weighted). Moist air containing 0.3% (3,000 ppm) HbS was then passed<br>
through the column of adsorbent at 1.4 L/min. The breakthrough of H2S was monitored<br>
using an InterScan LD-17 H2S continuous monitor system interfaced with a computer data<br>
acquisition program. The test was stopped at the breakthrough concentration of 350 ppm.<br>
The adsorption capacities of each sorbent in terms of grams of H2S per gram of material<br>
were calculated by integration of the area above the breakthrough curves, and from the H2S<br>

Characterization of pore sizes and adsorption capacity of materials prepared was<br>
accomplished using physical sorption measurement. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms<br>
of N2 were measured by volumetric techniques. From the isotherms, the pore size<br>
distribution (PSD) was evaluated using the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The surface<br>
area was calculated using BET approach and micropore volumes using Dubinin-<br>
Radushkevich equation (DR). The results are presented in Table 5. The symbol "A"<br>
represents the difference in the specific pore volume before and after deposition of sulfur.<br>
For all samples but MS an increase in the volume of mesopores was found as a result of<br>
deposition of elemental sulfur and formation of new pores within that deposit. The<br>
examples of PSDs are presented in Figure 8.<br>

The performance of materials as sorbents for hydrogen sulfide was evaluated using<br>
lab developed breakthrough tests. Adsorbent samples were packed into a column (length 60<br>
mm, diameter 9 mm, bed volume 6 cm3) and prehumidified with moist air (relative<br>
humidity 80% at 25°C) for an hour. The amount of adsorbed water was estimated from the<br>
increase in the sample weight after pre-humidification (the sorbents were removed from the<br>
column and weighted). Moist air containing 0.3% (3,000 ppm) BbS was then passed<br>
through the column of adsorbent at 1.4 L/min. The breakthrough of BbS was monitored<br>
using an InterScan LD-17 HbS continuous monitor system interfaced with a computer data<br>
acquisition program. The test was stopped at the breakthrough concentration of 350 ppm.<br>
The adsorption capacities of each sorbent in terms of grams of KbS per gram of material<br>
were calculated by integration of the area above the breakthrough curves, and from the H2S<br>
20<br><br>

Example 4<br>
X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on WO, SS, MS, WOSS and<br>
WOSSMS adsorbent samples using standard powder diffraction procedure. Adsorbents<br>
were ground with methanol in a small agate mortar. Grinding of the adsorbents by hand<br>
ensures particle sizes between 5-10 |jm, which prevents line broadening in diffraction peaks.<br>
The mixture was smear-mounted onto the zero-background quartz window of a Philips<br>
specimen holder and allow to air dry. Samples were analyzed by Cu Kceradiation generated<br>
in a Phillips XRG 300 X-ray diffractometer. A quartz standard slide was run to check for<br>
instrument wander and to obtain accurate location of 2© peaks.<br>
In the waste oil based sludge sample heated at 650°C (WO650) only metallic copper<br>
was detected as a separate crystallographic phase. See, Figure 10. In the case of SS650,<br>
quartz (SiCte), cristobalite (SiCh), truscottite (Cai4Si24)Os8(OH)8 2 H2O), and metallic iron<br>
are present. After mixing two components and heating at 650 °C, besides quartz,<br>
cristobalite and metallic iron and copper, anorthite (CaAhSkOs) and diaspore (A10(OH))<br>
are detected.<br>
Comparison of the diffraction patterns presented in Figure 10 clearly shows the<br>
synergetic effect in the chemical composition of materials. New components formed<br>
having their origin on addition of silica (coming from sewage siudge), and iron and zinc<br>
from waste oil sludge. These results indicated formation of new phases with an increase in<br>
the pyrolysis temperature and time. Figure 10 shows the changes in chemistry after<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
pyrolysis for half an hour at 650°C while Figures 7A and 7B compare the sample pyrolyzed<br>
at 950°C.<br>
The examples of crystallographic phases found for samples pyrolyzed at various<br>
conditions are presented in Tables 14 and 15. The headings indicate the composition of the<br>
sample, the temperature it was pyrolyzed at and the duration of the pyrolysis. For example,<br>
SS650-0.5 is sewage sludge pyrolyzed at 650°C for 30 minutes.<br>

Thus, in sewage sludge origin materials obtained at 950 C such spinel-like<br>
compounds as wurtzite (ZnS), ferroan (Ca2(Mg,Fe)5(SiAl)s022(OH)2), chalcocite (Cui.96S),<br>
spinel (MgAl204), and feroxyhite (FeO(OH)) were found. In waste oil-based materials<br>
besides metallic iron, bornite (CusFeS4), hibonite (CaAluOw), zincite (ZnO), ankerite<br>
(Ca(Fe, Mg)(C03)2) are present. In metal sludge based adsorbent aluminum, metallic iron,<br>
copper, zinc, pyrope (Mg3Ah(Si04)3), perrohotite (Fe7Ss), Chalocopyrite (CuFeS2), Triolite<br>
(FeS) and Fersilicite, (FeSi) exist. Mixing sludges results in synergy enhancing the<br>
catalytic properties which is linked to formation of new entities such as sapphirine<br>

The results demonstrate the possibility of obtaining the valuable desulfurization<br>
catalysts from mixture of waste oil sludge and sewage sludge. Up to 30 wt % hydrogen<br>
sulfide can be retained on their surface. The surface properties, such as porosity,<br>
selectivity, or catalytic activity can be modified by changing the pyrolysis conditions. The<br>
catalytic activity and hydrogen sulfide removal capacity are directly related to the new<br>
surface chemistry formed by solid-state reactions during pyrolysis. This chemistry can also<br>
be controlled to certain degree by varying the composition of the precursor mixture. As a<br>
result of the synergy between the sludge components new chemistry and porosity is formed<br>
which enhances both the physicochemical properties of the materials and their performance.<br>
Figure 11 shows the comparison of the predicted (based on the composition and yield of the<br>
individual components) and measured volume of mesopores while Figure 12 compares the<br>
predicted and measured HbS breakthrough capacities.<br>

The adsorption capacity is much higher than that for commercial activated carbon<br>
and it is attributed to the high volume of mesopores and the presence of mineral-like<br>
structures, which can participate in ion exchange reactions and precipitation reactions.<br>

Materials<br>
Two industrial sludges, waste oil sludge (WO) and metal sludge (M) from Newport News<br>
Shipyard were mixed with dry tobacco compost, homogenized, dried at 120°C for 48<br>
hours and then carbonized at 650°C and 950°C in nitrogen in a horizontal furnace. The<br>
heating rate was 10 deg/min with a one hour holding time. The weight of the wet industrial<br>
sludges (they contain 75% water) was adjusted to have 10% and 50% industrial sludge<br>
component based on the dry mass. The names of the adsorbents obtained, their<br>
compositions along with the yield, ash content and bulk density are collected in Table 23.<br>
Tobacco waste is referred to as TC.<br>
The waste oil sludge was treated with CaCb, NaaPOt, NaOH and alum. Metal<br>
sludge treatment history includes addition of sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide for pH<br>
adjustments, AI2SO4 for coagulation, anionic and cationic polymers, sodium bisulfide for<br>
chromium reduction, lime and CaCh. Thus, besides alkaline or alkaline earth element-<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
containing compounds and iron, the waste oil sludge also contains 0.4% Cu, 2% Zn and<br>
between 200 and 1000 ppm of chromium, lead and nickel. In metal sludge there are less<br>
than 1 % each of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, selenium, vanadium and<br>
zinc. The content of volatile compounds in both waste oil sludge and metal sludge reaches<br>
40% their dry mass, while the content of water in as-received materials is about 75%.<br>

Evaluation offcS sorption capacity<br>
A custom-designed dynamic test was used to evaluate the performance of adsorbents<br>
for H2S adsorption from gas streams as described above. Adsorbent samples were ground<br>
(1-2 mm particle size) and packed into a glass column (length 370 mm, internal diameter 9<br>
mm, bed volume 6 cm3), and pre-humidified with moist air (relative humidity 80% at<br>
25°C) for one hour. The amount of water adsorbed was estimated from an increase in the<br>
sample weight. Moist air (relative humidity 80% at 25°C) containing 0.3% (3,000 ppm) of<br>
H2S was passed through the column of adsorbent at 0.5 L/min. The flow rate was<br>
controlled using Cole Parmer flow meters. The breakthrough of H2S was monitored using<br>
MultiRae photoionization sensor. The test was stopped at the breakthrough concentration<br>
of 100 ppm. The adsorption capacities of each adsorbent in terms of mg of hydrogen<br>
sulfide per g of adsorbent were calculated by integration of the area above the breakthrough<br>
curves, and from the EbS concentration in the inlet gas, flow rate, breakthrough time, and<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
mass of sorbent. For each sample the test was repeated at least twice. Besides H2S the<br>
content of SO2 in the outlet gas was also monitored using MultiRae photoionization sensor.<br>
The adsorbents exhausted after H2S adsorption are designated by adding an additional letter<br>
E to their names.<br>
Characterization of pore structure of adsorbents<br>
On the materials obtained sorption of nitrogen at its boiling point was carried out<br>
using ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics). Before the experiments, the samples were outgassed at<br>
120°C to constant vacuum (10-4 torr). From the isotherms, the surface areas (BET<br>
method), total pore volumes, Vt, (from the last point of isotherm at relative pressure equal<br>
to 0.99), volumes of micropores, Vmio (DR), mesopore volume Vmes, total pore volume, Vt,<br>
along with pore size distributions were calculated (DFT).<br>
pH<br>
The pH of a carbonaceous sample suspension provides information about the acidity<br>
and basicity of the surface. A sample of 0.4 g of dry carbon powder was added to 20 mL<br>
of distilled water and the suspension was stirred overnight to reach equilibrium. Then the<br>
pH of suspension was measured.<br>
Thermal analysis<br>
Thermal analysis was carried out using TA Instrument Thermal Analyzer. The<br>
instrument settings were: heating rate 10°C /min and a nitrogen atmosphere with 100<br>
mL/min flow rate. For each measurement about 25 mg of a ground adsorbent sample were<br>
used. For analysis of the results the derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG curves) are<br>
used. Ash content was determined from the residue left at 800°C after heating the samples<br>
in air.<br>
Elemental analysis<br>
Metal content in the adsorbents was determined using ICP in LSL labs, Syracuse,<br>
NY.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
XRD<br>
X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted using standard powder diffraction<br>
procedure. Adsorbents were ground with methanol in a small agate mortar. Grinding of<br>
the adsorbents by hand ensures particle sizes between 5-10 /mi, which prevents line<br>
broadening in diffraction peaks. The mixture was smear-mounted onto the zero-background<br>
quartz window of a Phillips specimen holder and allow to air dry. Samples were analyzed<br>
by Cu KQ, radiation generated in a Phillips XRG 300 X-ray diffractometer. A quartz standard<br>
slide was run to check for instrument wander and to obtain accurate location of 20 peaks.<br>
The H2S breakthrough curves are presented in Figure 13 and 14. As seen based on<br>
the steep rise in the breakthrough curves all tobacco based materials have short diffusion<br>
zone and almost immediately after H2S is detected in the outlet gas, the adsorbents stop to<br>
work allowing the challenge gas to pass chemically undisturbed through the bed. No SCh<br>
concentration was detected which indicates that all BbS is converted to sulfur. In the case<br>
of metal and oil sludge derived materials small concentrations of sulfur dioxide, up to few<br>
ppm were measured at the same time when hydrogen sulfide appeared in the outlet gas.<br>
Even after mixing 50% tobacco waste and 50% waste oil, the kinetics of hydrogen sulfide<br>
retention characteristic to tobacco were still predominant since the shape of the slope of the<br>
curve does not resemble the one obtained for waste oil derived adsorbent.<br>
The results of the H2S breakthrough capacity measurements are summarized in<br>
Table 24 where besides the capacity expressed unit mass per gram of the adsorbents and<br>
per unit volume of the bed, the amount of water adsorbed during the prehumidification and<br>
the pH of the surface before and after adsorption process are reported.<br>
As seen from Table 24, the highest capacity is found for tobacco waste oil sludge<br>
compositions pyrolyzed at 950°C. Although higher content of oil sludge is beneficial for<br>
the performance, even only 10% waste oil sludge increases the performance about 100%<br>
compared to pure tobacco waste based material. For CTC material the high temperature of<br>
pyrolysis also significantly enhances the capacity. The results suggest the predominant<br>
influence of the tobacco waste on the performance since the waste oil sludge derived<br>
materials were reported to have best capacity at low temperature. In fact comparison of the<br>
capacity obtained for both tobacco and waste oils sludge based materials obtained at 950°C<br>
clearly shows the synergetic effect; the capacity obtained for the mixture is much higher<br>
than for either one of its components.<br>

As seen from Table 24, the highest capacity is found for tobacco waste oil sludge<br>
mixtures pyrolyzed at 950°C. Although higher content of oil sludge is beneficial for the<br>
performance, even only 10% waste oil sludge increases the performance about 100%<br>
compared to pure tobacco waste based material. For CTC material, the high temperature<br>
of pyrolysis also significantly enhances the capacity. These results suggest the predominant<br>
influence of the tobacco waste on the performance since the waste oil sludge derived<br>
materials were reported to have best capacity at low temperature. In fact comparison of the<br>
capacity obtained for both tobacco and waste oils sludge-based materials obtained at 950 °C<br>
clearly shows the synergetic effect; the capacity obtained for the mixture is much higher<br>
than for either one of its components.<br>
Pyrolysis of waste oil sludge/tobacco mixture at 650 °C with a high content of waste<br>
oil sludge component has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Although on the surface of<br>
this sample the high amount of water is adsorbed, the capacity is negligible. Since the<br>
materials from waste oil sludge pyrolized at 650 °C had a very high capacity (reaching 30%<br>
wt.), the tobacco component hinders the capacity when low temperature treatment is<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
applied. On the other hand, when metal sludge is used and mixture is pyrolyzed at low<br>
temperature, the capacity is enhanced compared to pure tobacco or pure metal sludge.<br>
Pyrolyzing those two mixtures at high temperature enhances capacity for low sludge content<br>
indicating once again the importance of the tobacco phase for hydrogen sulfide removal on<br>
composite adsorbents.<br>
Taking into account variations in the behavior of the samples within their pyrolysis<br>
temperature, the relationship between the amount of water preadsorbed and the H2S<br>
breakthrough capacity was analyzed. As seen from Figure 15, for the samples pyrolyzed at<br>
low temperature have a detrimental effect on the H2S breakthrough capacity. This may be<br>
linked to the low degree of mineralization and reactivity of the surface. It is likely that<br>
exposure to water causes its reaction with metal oxides and formation of hydroxides, which<br>
was observed previously. If the small pores are present, those hydroxides may block then-<br>
entrances and thus decrease the available space for H2S adsorption and sulfur storage. This<br>
problem is readdressed below were the porosity is discussed.<br>
In the case of samples pyrolyzed at 950°C, water apparently enhances the capacity.<br>
This might be linked to its physical retention on the surface and formation of water film, in<br>
which the basic pH exists. This enables high concentration of HS~ ions and thus their<br>
oxidation to elemental sulfur.<br>
All samples have basic pH, which helps with in hydrogen sulfide removal. The<br>
lowest pH is found for the CTCWO-2A sample, which has also the very low H2S removal<br>
capacity. That pH is much lower than the pH of its components. The reason for this might<br>
be either in oxidation of the carbon phase or specific chemistry formed as a result of<br>
synergetic effect between the composite components.<br>
Checking the synergetic effect on the H2S breakthrough capacity, the measured<br>
values were compared to those calculated assuming the physical mixtures of the components,<br>
and taking into account their yields. The results presented in Figure 16. While in the case<br>
of metal sludge only slight enhancement in the capacity is observed as a result of mixing,<br>
for the waste oil sludge/tobacco composites a significant synergetic effect is found with four<br>
fold increase in the capacity for CTCWO-2B.<br>
That synergetic effect might be the result of either new catalytic phases formed<br>
when the materials are mixed and exposed to high temperature, formation of new pores<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
enhancing physical adsorption and storage of oxidation products, an increased dispersion of<br>
catalytic phase, or more likely, the combination of all of these factors.<br>
Using X-ray diffraction one may see both, the changes in the degree of crystallinity<br>
of the adsorbents and the formation of new phases as a result of solid state reaction. Figure<br>
17 shows the comparison of XRD patterns for CTC adsorbents obtained at 650 and 950°C.<br>
As seen from the analysis of the ash content (Table 23) all adsorbents, even those derived<br>
from only tobacco waste have the majority of me inorganic phase. In the case of CTCA<br>
only quartz, and magnesian of ferrosilite ((Fe,Mg)Si03) are identified. Heating at 950°C<br>
results in formation of more crystalline phases identified as bayerite (Al(OH)3), ordered<br>
anorthite (CaAbSi208),anthophyllite ((Mg, Fe)7Sis022(OH)2), and barrigerite (Fe2P). Some<br>
of these minerals such as barrigerite, were also identfied in sewage sludge derived materials<br>
in which enhanced KbS adsorption was found. Magnesium, calcium and iron from these<br>
minerals can contribute to catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur. In the case of<br>
CWOB metallic iron, bornite (CusFeS4), hibonite (CaAli20i9), zincite (ZnO) and ankerite<br>
(Ca(Fe Mg)(C03&gt;2) are detected (Figure 18). Heating metal sludge to 950°C resulted in<br>
formation of numerous crystalline phases (multipeak pattern) from which pyrrohotite (Fei-<br>
xS), troilite (FeS), pyrope (Mg3Al2(SiCU)3), and metallic copper, zinc and iron have high<br>
probability to exist.<br>
A multipeak pattern is also observed for the mixtures of tobacco with metal sludge<br>
of various compositions and pyrolyzed at two different temperatures. Comparison of<br>
Figures 17, 18 and 19 clearly shows that new phases are detected. Examples of these new<br>
phases for CTCM-1A are spinel (MgAhO-i), margarite (CaAl2(Si2Al2)Oio(OH)2), malachite<br>
(Cu2C03(OH)2, calcite (CaCOs), cordierite (Mg^kSkOis), pigeonite (Fe,Mg,Ca)Si03),<br>
corundum (AI2O3), tenorite (CuO), magnesioferrite QAgFezOi), moissanite (SiC) and<br>
metallic iron. By pyrolyzing at 950°C, the mixture containing more metal sludge derived<br>
phase results in even more complex chemistry with predominant structures of mixed<br>
calcium iron and magnesium silicates and aluminosilicates. Some of them, as ferrocilite,<br>
anorthite were present in CTC-A. Examples are fosterite (Mg2SiO»), huntite<br>
(Mg3Ca(C03», aragonite (CaCCb), wollastonite (CaSiOs), dolomite (CaMg(C03)2,<br>
cohenite, (Fe3C) fersilicite (FeSi), covelite (CuS), bornite (CusFeS^, grunerite<br>
(Fe7Si8022(OH)2), hardystonite (CaaZnSkCb) or akermanite (Ca2MgSk07). In this case,<br>
compared to the sample pyrolized at 650°C, more carbonates are present, likely the result<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
ui gasmcation of carbon, less aluminum is involved in crystalline phase, and more two<br>
element-compounds appear.<br>
Very complex and different form parent compound structure is obtained for CTCWO-<br>
2B (Figure 19). In this case, besides significant amount of quartz, over 50 new compounds<br>
were detected. They are mainly aluminoslicate with magnesium, calcium, iron, sodium,<br>
copper and lead. Examples include: sodian of anorthite ((Ca, Na) (Al, Si^SizOg), forsterite<br>
(Mg2Si04), albite (CaAl2Si208), richterite (KNaCaMgsSigC^OHk), renhahnite<br>
(Ca3(Si308(OH)2), Dahlite (Ca^sNa^CPO^s^CCb), rockbridgeite (Fe5 (P04)3(OH)s).<br>
Although surface chemistry can play a crucial role in the process of hydrogen<br>
sulfide oxidation on the surface of materials studied, its effects cannot be discussed in<br>
isolation from the description of porous structure. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms are<br>
collected in Figures 20 and 21. Their shapes and nitrogen uptakes indicate differences in<br>
the sizes and volume of pores. While tobacco derived adsorbents are both very<br>
microporous, addition of waste oil sludge and metals sludge component contributes to the<br>
development of mesoporosity. The structural parameters calculated from nitrogen<br>
adsorption isotherms are collected in Table 25. Either waste oil sludge or metal sludge<br>
addition increase the surface areas of samples obtained at 950 °C in spite of the fact that the<br>
surface areas of both components pysolyzed separately are much smaller. This indicates<br>
the beneficial synergetic effect. That development of porosity can be caused by gasification<br>
of carbon phase by alkaline earth metals present in the sludges, which can be considered as<br>
self-activation. Adding more waste oil sludge increases surface area, volume of micropores<br>
and volume of mesopores. Although the latter are present in much higher volume in the<br>
CWOB adsorbent, the new volume of micropores is the result of activation during pyrolysis.<br>
On the other hand, addition of metal sludge, even in only small quantity seems to be most<br>
beneficial for tobacco/metal sludge mixtures. These materials have a new volume of<br>
mesopores formed, which do not exist in either tobacco or metal sludge only based<br>
materials. Gasification can be important here. Much more alkaline earth metals than in<br>
waste oil sludge results (Table 26) in formation of larger pores in the carbonaceous deposit.<br>
It is interesting that the smallest surface area and pore volume are obtained for metal sludge<br>
tobacco mixture with 50/50 ratio of composition pyrolyzed at 650 °C. This is consistent<br>
with this sample low capacity for hydrogen sulfide removal. Since both tobacco derived<br>
samples have almost identical structural parameters the differences in their performance as<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
hydrogen sulfide adsorbents must be attributed to differences in surface chemistry<br>
mentioned above.<br>

After H2S removal the surface area and volumes of micropores significantly<br>
decrease. For the majority of samples, but CTC-BE, CTCWO-1AE and CTCM-2BE the<br>
volume of mesopores increases. This phenomenon was observed before and was attributed<br>
to formation of new pores within either sulfur deposit in large pores, if capacity was high,<br>
or/and formation of hydroxides on the surface as a result of exposure to water during<br>
prehumidification. Although in the case of CTCM-2BE only small amount of water was<br>
adsorbed with relatively high amount of H2S, taking into account the small surface area of<br>
the samples, a significant, almost 100% increase in the volume of mesopores can be<br>
attributed to that sulfur deposit. The surface in large pores of the materials must be active<br>
36<br><br>
PCT/US2006/034961<br>
,VO 2007/030677<br>
since extensive gasification helped in high dispersion on the catalysts on the surface. For<br>
CTCW0-1AE, that increase can be attributed to the formation of hydroxides, since the<br>
surface is active and large amounts of water are adsorbed, and also to sulfur deposit. These<br>
hydroxides can totally block the porosity in the carbon deposit when more sludge derived<br>
phase is present and sample is exposed to moisture from the atmosphere. This likely<br>
happens in the case of CTCWO-2A, which was totally inactive in the process of H2S<br>
adsorption, contrary to only waste oil sludge based sample whose capacity was found<br>
significant previously and it was attributed to the high volume of mesopores, which, owing<br>
to their large sizes, cannot be blocked by hydroxides. As seen from Table 25 the average<br>
pore sizes calculated using Dubinin-Astakhov method are related to the values of the<br>
characteristic energy of adsorption, which is the highest for CTC-A, CTCWO-1A, and<br>
CTCM-1A. These materials are obtained at low temperature so they can be considered as<br>
chars or "underactivated" carbons.<br>

Details about the differences in the porosity of our samples are presented in Figures<br>
22, 23A &amp; B and 24A &amp; B as pore size distributions. For all samples on the distributions<br>
two regions can be seen. One consists of micropores which are much more heterogeneous<br>
in their sizes for CTC and CTWO series of samples than for CTCM. On the other hand,<br>
the heterogeneity of mesopores is much greater for the latter group of samples. After fibS<br>
adsorption the smallest pores are not seen anymore indicating that sulfur is deposited either<br>
there, or at their entrances, and the new pores appears, especially with the range of sizes<br>
between 50-200 A. In same cases it happens with the expense of macropores. This shows<br>
importance of large porosity with catalytically active surface to the process of hydrogen<br>
sulfide oxidation. If only physical adsorption were predominant those pores would not play<br>
any role and would have a negative effect on the performance of materials based on the unit<br>
volume of the bed. Thus in the case of this groups of materials very light adsorbents can be<br>
used which may increase the cost effectiveness of the removal process.<br>

The synergetic effect of the porosity development in our materials is presented in<br>
Figures 25 and 26 where the measured volumes of micro and mesopores are compared to<br>
those calculated assuming the physical mixture of the components and taking into account<br>
the yield of materials. As dissussed above, the synergetic effects of the sludge components<br>
on activation of the final products is clearly seen with the most pronounced effects of waste<br>
oil sludge on the volume of micropores and metal sludge - on the volume of mesopores.<br>
To check the role of porosity for HzS adsorption, the dependence of the capacity on<br>
the volume of pores was analyzed. The results are presented in Figure 27. As seen, a<br>
good relationship is found for the volume of micropores. They have they origin likely in<br>
the tobacco derived carbon phase thus this component of the H2S adsorption process has to<br>
have similar mechanism on all tobacco containing samples. Linear trend is also noticed for<br>
the volume of mesopores but only for materials obtained at 950°C. As it was shown above,<br>
water has a detrimental effect on the chemistry of low temperature pyrolyzed samples, thus<br>
the linear trend in his case is not expected. The linear relationship between the capacity<br>
and volume of mesopores indicates the activity of large pores in the process of hydrogen<br>
sulfide catalytic oxidation.<br>
The comparison of DTG curves before and after adsorption of hydrogen sulfide is<br>
presented in Figures 28, 29, and 30. The peaks on the curves represent weight loss due to<br>
the decomposition/desorption of surface species. For some initial samples as CTCB,<br>
CTCM-1A, CTCM-1B an increase in weight (negative peaks) is observed between 150 and<br>
400°C and between 600 and 800°C. The latter negative peak is also found for CTCWO-2B.<br>
This strange behavior was noticed previously for some metal sludge, waste oil sludge and<br>
even sewage sludge-based adsorbents. Since only nitrogen was present formation of<br>
nitrides was given as the only plausible explanation. After H2S adsorption a negative peak<br>
is present only at high temperature range for CTCM-2BE. For other samples it is<br>
compensated by weight loss caused by removal of deposited sulfur between 200-400°C.<br>
Although this weight loss/peak intensity should be proportional to the amount of hydrogen<br>
sulfide deposited on the surface in the case of material pyrolyzed at 650°C addition to the<br>
weight loss occurs as a result of dehydroxylation of surface at temperature smaller than<br>
600°C. The hydroxides were formed when samples were exposed to water during<br>
prehumidification and H2S adsorption.<br>

WO 2007/030677	PCT/US2006/034961<br>
Pyrolysis of waste tobacco compost and industrial sludges from heavy industries<br>
leads to the development of effective catalyst for desulfurization of air. An important role<br>
of carbonaceous phase derived from waste tobacco is in its relatively high carbon content.<br>
That carbon contributes to the development of porosity in both, micro and mesopore ranges.<br>
This happens via self-activation of carbon material by alkaline earth metals and water<br>
released from the decomposition of inorganic matter during heat treatment. As a result of<br>
solid state reactions at high temperature new catalytic species are formed on the surface of<br>
adsorbent as a result of synergy between the components of sludges. Location of these<br>
species in mesopores is beneficial for the desulfurization process. The surface of those<br>
pores retain water film where hydrogen sulfide can dissociate in the basic environment,<br>
Sulfur formed in oxidation reaction can be stored there in large quantity without rapid<br>
deactivation of the catalytic centers by sterical hindrances. High temperature of pyrolysis is<br>
beneficial for the adsorbents due to the enhanced activation of carbonaceous phase and<br>
chemical stabilization of inorganic phase. Samples obtained at low temperature are<br>
sensitive to water, which deactivates their catalytic centers.<br>
The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments<br>
described herein. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those<br>
described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing<br>
description and the accompanying figures. Such modifications are intended to fall within<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br>

Industrial waste derived adsorbents were obtained by pyrolysis of sewage sludge, metal sludge, waste oil sludge<br>
and tobacco waste in some combination. The materials were used as media to remove hydrogen sulfide at room temperature in the<br>
presence of moisture. The initial and exhausted adsorbents after the breakthrough tests were characterized using sorption of nitrogen,<br>
thermal analysis, XRD, ICP, and surface pH measurements. Mixing tobacco and sludges result in a strong synergy enhancing the<br>
catalytic properties of adsorbents. During pyrolysis new mineral phases are formed as a result of solid state reaction between the<br>
components of the sludges. High temperature of pyrolysis is beneficial for the adsorbents due to the enhanced activation of carbonaceous<br>
phase and chemical stabilization of inorganic phase. Samples obtained at low temperature are sensitive to water, which<br>
deactivates their catalytic centers.<br></td>
