				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a novel cermet<br>
anode useful for eco-friendly electrolytic extraction of metals from fused salts.<br>
Metals, which are less noble than hydrogen in the emf series, have necessarily to<br>
be electro-won from fused salts. Even other reduction processes may not be<br>
economically viable for production such as in the case of metals like aluminium,<br>
titanium, Be, Ca, Mg, Na. Hence, electrolytic route becomes necessary for the<br>
extraction of such metals. Further, an eco-friendly electrolytic extraction of such<br>
metals is definitely needed.<br>
The novel cermet anode of the present invention will be particularly useful for<br>
eco-friendly electrolytic extraction of metals such as aluminum.<br>
The aluminium metal presently is manufactured by the Hall-Heroult process by<br>
the electrolysis of aluminia - cryolite melt between consumable carbon anode<br>
and carbon block cathode at temperatures ranging from 950 to 980° C. During<br>
the electrolysis aluminium metal is pooled to the cathode at the bottom and<br>
carbon dioxide, (COz) is liberated at the carbon anode. The evolution of CO2 - a<br>
green house gas is by the inherent consumption of anode carbon according to<br>
the following reaction:<br>
2 AI203 + 3 C - 4 Al + 3 C02<br>
Theoretically 334 Kg of carbon only is required for one ton of aluminium but in<br>
practice about 500 kg is consumed, liberating 2 tons of C02 to the atmosphere.<br>
The use of carbon as anode for aluminium electrolysis has the following<br>
disadvantages:<br>
1. Liberation of carbon dioxide, a green house gas with harmful effects.<br>
2. The carbon must be very high purity, free from silicon, sulphur, vanadium.<br>
3. Frequent lowering and adjustment of the anode to maintain optimum<br>
anode - cathode distance.<br>
4. Turbulance and unsteady voltage conditions resulting higher voltage and<br>
higher energy consumption.<br>
5. Process is labour intensive and environmentally hazardous.<br>
6. Necessity of a separate anode shop.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S.Patent 3930967 (1976) in which electrodes<br>
made from SnO2, SbaOa and CuO were used for aluminum production. The main<br>
drawback is that very low current density ranging from 0.001 to 0.025 A/cm2 only<br>
has been applied.<br>
Reference may be made to another U.S Patent No.4057480 (1977), wherein<br>
mixed materials of SnO2, Fe20s, CoO, ZnO are used as inert anodes for<br>
aluminium electrolysis. The drawback being the contamination of the cathode<br>
product with excess tin.<br>
In a Japanese patent No.1461155 (1977), oxygen ion conducting anodes are<br>
disclosed in which both spinel and perovskite structures containing ZrOz as major<br>
constituent have been tested. The trial run faced many operational difficulties,,<br>
Electrolysis with anodes fabricated from oxides of Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sn, Y and Cu<br>
powder up to 0 - 30% is given in U.S patent 6126799 (2001). The problem<br>
encountered was the contamination and high wear rate of the electrodes.<br>
Work on similar lines with cermet anodes incorporating Ag powders have been<br>
patented in Canada pat 2317596, (2001). The difficulty with the electrolysis<br>
being dissolution of the electrode and contamination of the aluminum metal<br>
produced.<br>
Reference may be made to a paper by T.R.AIcorn etal, "Light metals 1993" (Ed)<br>
Subodh.K.Das Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Warrendale PA (1993) P.<br>
433-443, in which operational results of a pilot cell test with inert anode has been<br>
published. The drawbacks are the instability of the electrode materials and tested<br>
up to a current density of 0.5 A/cm2 only.<br>
In a paper by J.S.Gregg etal., Light Metals, 1993 (Ed) Suboth.K.Das, Minerals,<br>
Metals and Materials Society, Warrendale P.A. (1993) P.455-464, have<br>
discussed the testing of copper - nickel ferrite / NiO with or without cerium oxide<br>
coating for electrowinning of aluminium. The high energy cost due to low<br>
conductivity of the anode was attributed as the main drawback.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode useful for eco-friendly electrolytic<br>
extraction of metals from fused salts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which consists of compositions without any<br>
binders and is amenable to high-pressure compacting and high temperature<br>
sintering methods.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which is thermally stable at 1000° C.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which is chemically inert and nonconsumable<br>
in a cryolite melt and should not contaminate the cathode product.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which has high electrical conductivity.<br>
A further another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which has low and high anodic over<br>
voltages for oxygen and fluorine evolution, respectively.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which is dense and resistant to oxidation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which should be cheap and amenable for<br>
fabrication by the existing techniques.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which will be particularly useful for ecofriendly<br>
electrolytic extraction of metals such as aluminum from alumina in<br>
molten cryolite.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode which can substitute the consumable<br>
carbon anodes of the Hall Heroult cell with non-consumable cermet anodes for a<br>
trouble free and environmentally clean production of aluminium from alumina by<br>
electrolysis.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of a<br>
novel cermet anode useful for eco-friendly electrolytic extraction of metals, such<br>
as aluminum, from fused salts. The process provides a novel cermet anode<br>
which consists of compositions of mixed oxides of transition and rare earth<br>
metals in combination with metal powders, without any binders, and is amenable<br>
to high-pressure compacting and high temperature sintering methods. The novel<br>
cermet anode manufactured by the process of the present invention is thermally<br>
stable at 1000° C, is chemically inert and non-consumable in a cryolite melt and<br>
does not contaminate the cathode product, has low and high anodic over<br>
voltages for oxygen and fluorine evolution, respectively, and is dense and<br>
resistant to oxidation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a<br>
novel cermet anode useful for eco-friendly electrolytic extraction of metals from<br>
fused salts, which comprises mixing intimately 80 to 90 wt.% dry powders of<br>
oxides of one or more of the metals selected from Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Zn, Al, Ti, Cr,<br>
Ce, La, Nb, and 10 to 20 wt. % metal powders selected from Au, Ag, Bi, Sb, Cu,<br>
Ni, Zn, either alone or in combination, to obtain a dry blend of powder<br>
composition, compacting the dry blend to obtain green compacts, sintering the<br>
green compacts at a temperature of up to 1400°C under normal atmospheres,<br>
allowing the sintered compact to cool and fixing current leads to obtain a novel<br>
cermet anode.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the intimate mixing to obtain a dry<br>
blend of powder composition of metal oxide powders and meta! powders is<br>
carried out by known methods.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the size reduction and size<br>
analysis of metallic oxides and metal powders is effected by known ceramic<br>
technology methods.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the dry blend of powder<br>
composition optionally consists of binders.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the compacting of the dry<br>
blend is done, in sizes ranging from 5 -12 cm diameter and 5 -12 cm height, in a<br>
hydraulic press to obtain green compacts.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention the sintering of the green<br>
compacts is carried out in a furnace, such as an electric furnace, at a<br>
temperature of up to 1400°C, with a holding schedule of the order of several<br>
hours at intermediate temperatures.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is that it provides a process for the<br>
manufacture of a novel cermet anode useful for eco-friendly electrolytic<br>
extraction of metals from fused salts. The novel cermet anode of the present<br>
invention consists of compositions without any binders and is amenable to highpressure<br>
compacting and high temperature sintering methods. The novel cermet<br>
anode manufactured by the process of the present invention is thermally stable<br>
at 1000° C, is chemically inert and non-consumable in a cryolite melt and does<br>
not contaminate the cathode product, has low and high anodic over voltages for<br>
oxygen and fluorine evolution, respectively, and is dense and resistant to<br>
oxidation.<br>
The above noted novel features have been made possible due to the nonobvious<br>
inventive steps of the present invention which comprises mixing<br>
intimately 80 to 90 wt.% dry powders of oxides of one or more of the metals<br>
selected from Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Zn, Al, Ti, Cr, Ce, La, Nb, and 10 to 20 wt. % metal<br>
powders selected from Au, Ag, Bi, Sb, Cu, Ni, Zn, either alone or in combination,<br>
to obtain a dry blend of powder composition, compacting the dry blend to obtain<br>
green compacts, sintering the green compacts at a temperature of up to 1400°C<br>
under normal atmospheres.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not<br>
be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
A cermet anode having composition containing 85 wt.% mixture of NiO, Fe203,<br>
Nb2O5 and 15 wt.% combination of metal powders of Cu, Bi was compacted and<br>
used in an eco-friendly electrolyser. The electrolyser was operated with molten<br>
aluminum over carbon block cathodes containing cryolite with excess aluminum<br>
fluoride and 8 wt% of alumina as electrolyte at a constant current density of 0.50<br>
A/cm2. Continuous electrolysis was carried out at 950°C, for 180 hrs at an interelectrode<br>
distance of 3.5cm. Aluminum metal was produced at an energy<br>
consumption of 13.4 kwh/ kg of aluminum.<br>
Example - 2<br>
An electrolytic cell for the production of aluminum metal was operated with<br>
cermet anode of composition 80 wt.% mixture of NiO, Fe2O3, Ce2O3 and 20 wt %<br>
combination of metal powders of Bi plus Cu, in a cryolite electrolyte containing 6<br>
wt % of AI2C«3 maintained at a temperature of 980° C and an inter-electrode<br>
distance of 4 cm at a current density of 0.80 A/cm2. Pure aluminum was<br>
deposited to cathode at a current efficiency of 82%. The purity of the metal<br>
obtained was 99 4 wt % with the impurities of Fe = 0.15 wt %, Ni = 0.04 wt % and<br>
Cu = 0.04 wt %.<br>
Example - 3<br>
An eco-friendly electrolyser consisting of non-consumable cermet anodes made<br>
by ceramic technology containing 90 wt % of mixture of Fe2O3, NiO and La2O3<br>
and 10 wt % of a combination of metal powders of Ni, Cu and Sb, carbon block<br>
cathode, and molten cryolite electrolyte was operated at a current density of 1.0<br>
A/cm2 at a temperature of 960° C for 140 hrs. to obtain primary aluminum at the<br>
cathode and pure oxygen at the anode at a current efficiency of 85%. The metal<br>
so obtained was of 99.2% purity with the impurities Cu 0.05 wt %, Fe 0.20wt %<br>
and Ni 0.05 wt %.<br>
From the above examples it is confirmed that the novel cermet anode<br>
manufactured by the process of the present invention is stable and not<br>
consumed during the electrolysis and can be a suitable substitute for carbon of<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
