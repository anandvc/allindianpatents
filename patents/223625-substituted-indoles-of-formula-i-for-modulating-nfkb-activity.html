				<td>The invention relates to novel substituted indoles, to processes for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.<br>
The application WO 94/12478 describes, inter alia, indole derivatives which inhibit blood platelet aggregation. WO 94/08962 describes fibrinogen receptor antagonists which inhibit fibrinogen binding and blood platelet aggregation.<br>
NFKB is a heterodimeric transcription factor which can activate a large number of genes which code, inter alia, for proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, TNFcc or IL-6. NFKB is present in the cytosole of cells, complexed with its naturally occurring inhibitor IKB. The stimulation of cells, for example by cytokines, leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation of IKB. This proteolytic degradation leads to the activation of NFKB, which subsequently migrates into the. nucleus of the cell and there activates a large number of proinflammatory genes. In disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarct, Alzheimer's disease or athero¬sclerosis, NFKB is activated beyond the normal extent. The inhibition of NFKB is also of benefit in cancer therapy, since it is employed there for the reinforcement of the cytostatic therapy. It was possible to show that pharmaceuticals such as glucocorticoids, salicylates or gold salts, which are employed in rheumatic therapy, intervene in an inhibitory manner at various points in the NFKB-activating signal chain or interfere directly with the transcription of the genes.<br>
The first step in the signal cascade mentioned is the degradation of IKB. This phosphorylation is regulated by the specific IKB kinase. To date, no inhibitors are known which specifically inhibit IKB kinase.<br>
In an attempt to obtain active compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarct, Alzheimer's disease, carcinomateous disorders (potentiation of cytotoxic therapies) or atherosclerosis,<br><br>

Examples of heteroatoms are N, O and S. If a number of heteroatoms are contained, these can be identical or different.

The expression "heterocycle having 5 to 12 ring members" represents a monocyclic or bicyclic 5-membered to 12-membered heterocyclic ring which is partly saturated or completely saturated. Examples of heteroatoms are N, O and S. The heterocycle is unsubstituted or substituted on one or more carbon atoms or on one or more heteroatoms by identical or different substituents. These substituents have been defined above for the radical heteroaryl. In particular, the heterocyclic ring is monosubstituted or polysubstituted, for example monosubstituted, disubstituted, trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted, on carbon atoms by identical or different radicals from the group consisting of (Ci-C8)-alkyl, for example (Ci-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-Ce)-alkoxy, for example (C-|-C4)-alkoxy such as methoxy, phenyl-(Ci-C4&gt;-alkoxy, for example benzyloxy, hydroxy), oxo, halogen, nitro, amino or thfluoromethyl and/or it is substituted on the ring nitrogen atom(s) in the heterocyclic ring by (Ci-CsJ-alkyl, for example (Cf-C4)-alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, by optionally substituted phenyl or phenyl-(Ci-C4)-alkyl, for example benzyl.

The structural formula of a-amino acids is as follows:<br><br>
The a-amino acids differ from one another by the radical R, which in the context of the present application is described as a "characteristic radical" of an amino acid.<br>
g<br>
In the case where R is the characteristic radical of an amino acid, the characteristic radicals employed are preferably those of the following naturally occurring a-amino acids: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine, glutamine, lysine, histidine, arginine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Those particularly preferred are histidine, tryptophan, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine, glutamine, lysine, arginine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Preferred characteristic radicals<br>
Q<br>
of an amino acid which are furthermore employed as the radical R are also non-naturally occurring amino acids such as 2-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, 2-aminopimelic acid, phenyl glycine, 3-{2-thienyl)alanine, 3-(3-thienyl)alanine, 2-(2-thienyl)-glycine, 2-aminoheptanoic acid, pipecolic acid, hydroxylysine, sarcosine, N-methylisoleucine, 6-N-methy||ysine, N-methylvaline, norvallne, norieucine, ornithine, allo-isoleucine, allo-threonine, allo-hydroxylysine, 4-hydroxyproline, 3-hydroxyproline, 3-(2-naphthyI)alanine, 3-(1-naphthyl-alanine), homophenylalanine, homocysteine, homocysteic acid, homotryptophan, cysteic acid, 3-(2-pyridyl)aianine, 3-(3-pyridyl)alanine, 3-(4-pyridyl)alanine, 2-amino-3-phenylaminopropionic acid, 2-amino-3-phenylaminoethylpropionic acid, phosphinothricine, 4-fluorophenylalanine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, 4-fluorophenyl a la nine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, 2-fluorophenylalanine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, 4-nitrophenylalanine, 4-aminophenylalanine, cyclohexylalanine, citrulline, 5-fluorotryptophan, 5-methoxytryptophan, methionine sulfone, methionine sulfoxide or -NH-NR   -CON(R   )i, which are optionally also substituted. In<br><br>
the case of natural but also of non-naturally occurring amino acids which have a functional group such as amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, mercapto, guanidyl, imidazolyl or indolyl, this group can also be protected.<br>
Suitable protective groups for this are preferably the N-protective groups customarily used in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the urethane type, benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenyl-oxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbony) {Aloe) or of the acid amide type, in particular formyl, acetyl or trifluoroacetyl, and of the alkyl type, for example benzyl. In the case of an imidazole radical in R , for example, the sulfonic acid derivative of the formula IV employed for the sulfonamide formation is used as a protective group of the imidazole nitrogen, which can be removed again, in particular in the presence of bases such as aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
The starting substances for the chemical reactions are known or can be easily prepared by methods known from the literature.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for preparing compounds of the formula I and/or a stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically acceptable salt of the compound of the formula I, which comprises a)       reacting a compound of the formula IV,<br><br>
in which Pg is a suitable protective group (for example methyl ester), an amide group or a hydroxyl group and Z, R and R are as defined in formula I, with an acyl chloride or an activated ester of the compound of the formula III,<br><br>
where D1 is -COOH or sulfonyl halogen and R , R and R are as defined in formula I, in the presence of a base or, if appropriate, of a<br><br>
dehydrating agent in solution and, after removal of the protective group, converting into a compound of the formula I, or<br>
b)	reacting a compound of the formula IVa,<br><br>
7	8<br>
in which R and R are as defined in formula 1 and E is an N-amino protective group, with its carbonyl group coupled via an intermediate chain L to a polymeric resin of the formula PS, a compound of the formula V <br>
resulting, which, after selective removal of the protective group E, is<br>
5      6	9<br>
reacted with a compound of the formula III, where R , R    and R are as defined in formula I,  in the presence of a base or,  if appropriate, of a dehydrating agent to give a compound of the formula VI<br><br>
and converting the compound of the formula VI, after cleavage from the support material, into a compound of the formula I, or<br>
c)	converting a compound of the formula I  into  a  physiologically<br>
acceptable salt.<br>
In process variant a), the acid functions of the compounds of the formula IVa are provided with a protective group Pg; this selective carboxylic acid derivatization is carried out according to methods such as are described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Org. Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1. In process variant b), the amino functions of the<br><br>
r<br>
starting compounds of the formula IVa are provided with a protective group E; this selective amino groups derivatization is carried out according to methods such as are described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Org. Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1. A suitable protective group Pg preferably used for this is the carboxyl protective groups customary in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the alkyl ester type, such as methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, isopropyl, benzyl, fluorenylmethyl, allyl, aryl ester type, such as phenyl, amide type, such as amide or benzhydrylamine. Suitable protective groups E used for this are preferably the N-protective groups customary in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the urethane type, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and allyloxycarbonyl (Aloe) or of the acid amide type, in particular formyl, acetyl or trifluoroacetyl of alkyl type such as benzyl. The (trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl (Teoc) group has also proven particularly suitable for this (P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Thieme Verlag 1994).<br>
The indolecarboxylic acid derivatives were prepared following a method described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Org. Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume E6-2A and E6-2B. Thus, for preparing the indolecarboxylic acid derivatives of the formula III, preference is given to reacting hydrazinobenzoic acids and aryl ketones or heteroaryl ketones in the presence of poly phosphoric acid as solvent at 145°C. The hydrazinobenzoic acids required are prepared by methods known to the person skilled in the art, for example from the corresponding benzoic acid anilines. Aryl ketones or heteroaryl ketones are likewise prepared by methods familiar to the person skilled in the art, for example, from the corresponding acyl chlorides or nitriles by reaction with, for example, organometallic compounds.<br>
For the condensation of the compounds of the formula IV with those of the formula III, the coupling methods which are well-known per se to the person skilled in the art are advantageously used (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974). Suitable condensing agents or coupling reagents are compounds such as carbonyldiimidazole, carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide     (DiC),     0-((cyano(ethoxycarbonyl) methylene)-<br><br>
amino)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or propane-phosphonic anhydride (PPA).<br>
The condensations can be carried out under standard conditions. During the condensation, as a rule it is necessary for the non-reacting amino groups present to be protected by reversible protective groups. The same applies to carboxyl groups not involved in the reaction, which during the condensation are preferably present as (Ci-C6)-alkyl esters, benzyl esters or tert-butyl esters. Amino group protection is unnecessary if the amino groups are still present in the form of precursors such as nitro groups or cyano groups and are only formed by hydrogenation after the condensation. After the condensation, the protective groups present are removed in a suitable manner. For example, NO2 groups (guanidino protection in amino acids), benzyloxycarbonyl groups and benzyl groups in benzyl esters can be removed by hydrogenation. The protective groups of the tert-butyl type are removed acidically, while the 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl radical is removed by secondary amines.<br>
The polymeric support designated in the formulae V and VI by PS is a crosslinked polystyrene resin having a linker designated as the intermediate chain L This linker carries a suitable functional group, for example amine, known, for example, as Rink amide resin, or an OH group, known, for example, as Wang resin or Kaiser's oxime resin. Alternatively, other polymeric supports such as glass, cotton or cellulose having various intermediate chains L can be employed.<br>
The intermediate chain designated by L is covalently bonded to the polymeric support and allows a reversible, amide-like or ester-like bond with the compound of the formula IVa, which remains stable during the further reaction on the bonded compound of the formula IVa; but under strongly acidic reaction conditions, e.g. mixtures with trifluoroacetic acid, releases the group located on the linker again.<br>
The release of the desired compound of the formula I from the linker can be carried out at various positions in the reaction sequence.<br>
A. General procedure for the coupling of protected aminocarboxylic acids of the formula IVa to the solid support:<br>
The synthesis was carried out in reactors each having a reaction volume of 15 ml. Each of the reactors was filled with 0.179 g of Rink amide AM resin<br><br>
(Fmoc-Rink amide AM/Nova-Biochem; loading 0.56 mmol/g; i.e. 0.1 mmol/reactor). For the removal of the Fmoc protective group from the resin, a 30% strength piperidine/DMF solution was metered into each reactor and the mixture was shaken for 45 minutes (min). It was then filtered and the resin was washed 3 times with dimethylformamide (DMF). For the coupling of the protected amino acid, a 0.5 molar solution of the corresponding Fmoc-amino acid (0.3 mmol in DMF), a solution of HOBt {0.33 mmol in DMF) and a solution of DIC (0.33 mmol in DMF) were each added to the resin thus prepared and the mixture was shaken at 35°C for 16 hours (h). The resin was then washed with DMF a number of times. To check the coupling, a few resin beads were removed and subjected to a KAISER test; in all cases the test was negative.<br>
The removal of the Fmoc protective group was carried out, as mentioned above, using 30% strength piperidine/DMF solution. For the coupling of the benzimidazolecarboxylic acids, a 0.1 molar solution of the corresponding 4- or 5-substituted acid (0.4 mmol in DMF); a 0.5 molar solution of the coupling reagent TOTU (0.44 mmol in DMF) and a 0.5 molar solution of DIPEA (0.6 mmol in DMF) were added and the mixture was shaken at 40"C for 16 hours. It was then washed a number of times with DMF.<br>
To check the reaction, a few beads of resin were again removed and subjected to a KAISER test.<br>
For the removal of the desired substances from the solid support, the resin was washed a number of times with dichloromethane. The cleavage solution (50% dichloromethane and 50% of a mixture of 95% TFA, 2% H2O, 3% triisopropylsilane) was then added and the mixture was shaken at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The residue was precipitated with diethyl ether and filtered.<br>
The solid residues usually contained the desired products in high purity or were fractionated, for example, on a reverse phase (eluent: A: H2O/0.1% TFA, B: acetonitrile/0.1% TFA) using preparative high-pressure liquid chromatography. Lyophilization of the fractions obtained yielded the desired products.<br>
The preparation of physiologically acceptable salts of compounds of the formula I capable of salt formation, including their stereo isomeric forms, is carried out in a manner known per se. With basic reagents such as<br><br>
J<br>
hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogenc rbonates, alkoxides and also ammonia or organic bases, for example trimethyl- or triethylamine, ethanolamine or triethanolamine or alternatively basic amino acids, for example lysine, ornithine or arginine, the carboxylic acids form stable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium salts. If the compounds of the formula 1 contain basic groups, stable acid addition salts can also be prepared using strong acids. For this, both inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, 4-bromobenzenesutfonic, cyclohexyl-amidosulfonic, trifluoromethylsulfonic, acetic, oxalic, tartaric, succinic or trifluoroacetic acid are suitable.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals which comprise an efficacious amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt of the compounds of the formula I and/or an optionally stereoisomeric form of the compounds of the formula I, together with a pharmaceutical^ suitable and physiologically tolerable excipient, additive and/or other active compounds and auxiliaries.<br>
On account of the pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the prophylaxis and therapy of all those disorders in whose course an increased activity of IkB kinase is involved. These include, for example, chronic disorders of the locomotor apparatus, such as inflammatory, immunological or metabolic acute and chronic arthritic disorders, arthropathies, rheumatoid arthritis, or degenerative joint disorders, such as osteoarthroses, spondyloses, cartilage breakdown following joint trauma or prolonged immobilization of a joint after meniscus or patella injuries or desmorrhexis or disorders of the connective tissue, such as collagenoses and periodontal disorders, myalgias and disturbances of the bone metabolism, or disorders caused by overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFoc) or increased concentration of TNFct, such as cachexia, multiple sclerosis, skull-brain trauma, Crohn's disease and intestinal tumors, or disorders such as atherosclerosis, stenoses, ulceration, Alzheimer's disease, muscle wasting, carcinomatous disorders (potentiation of therapies with cytotoxic compounds), myocardial infarction, gout, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, viral infections, such as flu, hepatitis, HIV infections, AIDS, or disorders caused by adenoviruses or herpes viruses, parasitic infections, such as malaria or leprosy, fungal infections or yeast infections, meningitis,<br>
*<br><br>
chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic bronchitis or asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute synovitis, tuberculosis, psoriasis, diabetes, treatment of acute or chronic rejection responses of the organ recipient to the transplanted organ, chronic graft-versus-host disorders and inflammatory vascular disorders.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention are in general administered orally or parenterally. Rectal or transdermal administration is also possible.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the production of a pharmaceutical, which comprises bringing at least one compound of the formula I into a suitable administration form using a pharmaceuticaily suitable and physiologically tolerable excipient and, if appropriate, further suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable solid or pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders, coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions, and preparations having protracted release of active compound, in whose preparation customary auxiliaries, such as excipients, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are used. Frequently used auxiliaries which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, taic, lactoprotein, gelatin, starch, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils such as cod liver oil, sunflower, groundnut or sesame oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents such as, for example, sterile water and mono- or polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol. The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably produced and administered in dose units, each unit containing as active constituent a certain dose of the compound of the formula I according to the invention. In the case of solid dose units such as tablets, capsules, coated tablets or suppositories, this dose can be up to approximately 1000 mg, preferably from approximately 50 mg to 300 mg and in the case of injection solutions in ampoule form up to approximately 300 mg, preferably from approximately 10 mg to 100 mg. For the treatment of an adult patient weighing approximately 70 kg, depending on the efficacy of the compound according to formula I, daily doses of approximately 20 mg to 1000 mg of active compound, preferably from approximately 100 mg to 500 mg, are indicated. Under certain circumstances, however, even higher or lower<br><br>
daily doses may be appropriate. The administration of the daily dose can be carried out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else of a number of smaller dose units and by multiple administration of subdivided doses at specific intervals.<br>
As a rule, final products are determined by mass-spectroscopic methods (FAB-, ESI-MS). Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, RT means room temperature

r of 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran, followed by addition of 1.7 ml of glacial acetic acid, and the mixture was stirred at 20°C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate, the organic phases were combined and dried with sodium sulfate and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel (CH2CI2 / CH3OH / CH3COOH : 100 / 5/1). Removal of the mobile phase gave 1.3 g (87%) of 4-(1-pyrrolyl)-L-2-benzyloxycarbonylaminobutyricacid.<br>
b:   4-(1-Pyrrolyl)-L-2-benzyloxycarbonylaminobutyramide<br>
1.2 g (4.0 mmol) of 4-(1-pyrrolyl)-L-2-benzyloxycarbonylaminobutyric acid<br>
and 0.61 g (4.0 mmol) of N-hydroxybenzotriazole ammonium salt, were<br>
dissolved together in 10 ml of DMF, admixed at 0°C with 0.82 g (4.0 mmol)<br>
of    N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide    and    0.68 ml    (4.0 mmol)    of    N-<br>
ethyldiisopropylamine, and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 30 min and at<br>
20°C for 3 h. The precipitated urea was filtered off with suction and the<br>
filtrate was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.<br>
The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (CH2CI2 /<br>
CH3OH / CH3COOH : 100 / 5 /1). Yield: 0.89 g (74%).<br>
c:   4-(1-Pyrrolyl)-L-2-aminobutyramide<br>
Under inert gas, 0.80 g (2.65 mmol) of 4-(1-pyrrolyl)-L-2-benzyloxy-carbonylaminobutyramide, dissolved in 20 ml of methanol, was admixed with 80 mg of catalyst (10% Pd-C), and hydrogen was then introduced until the Z protective group had been cleaved off completely. The catalyst was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated, giving 0.4 g (90.5%) of 4-(1-pyrrolyl)-L-2-am inobutyramide.<br>
2. Process variant D)<br>
Example 3:<br>
N-(1-carbamoyl-2-phenylsulfanylethyl)-2-pyridin-4-yl-1H-indole-5-carbox-amide<br>
0.20 g (0.84 mmol) of 2-pyridin-4-yl-1H-indole-5-carboxylic acid was admixed with 0.21 g (1.07 mmol) of 2-amino-3-phenylsulfanylpropionic acid in 40 ml of DMF and, at 0°C, 0.66 g (1.27 mmol) of benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate and 0.37 ml (2.12 mmol) of N-ethyl-N,N-diisopropylamine were added, and the solution was stirred at 20°C for 2 h. The solution was concentrated under reduced<br><br>
pressure and purified by medium pressure column chromatography (CH2CI2 / CH3OH : 9:1). This gave 0.19 g (54%) of N-(1-carbamoyl-2-phenylsulfanylethyl)-2-pyridin-4-yl-1H-indole-5-carboxamide.<br>
Example 9:<br>
3-Phenylaminoethyl-2-[(2-pyridin-4-yl-1H-indole-5-carbonyl)-amino]propion-<br>
amide<br><br>
a) L-2-Amino-3-phenylaminoethylpropionic acid<br>
54.8 g (0.209 mol) of triphenylphosphine were suspended in 600 ml of acetonitrile and, with exclusion of moisture, cooled to -35°C to -45°C. At this temperature, 36.4 g (0.209 mol) of diethyl azodicarboxylate were then added dropwise over a period of 50 min. The mixture was stirred at -35°C for another 15 min. A solution of 50 g (0.209 mol) of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-serine in 500 ml of acetonitrile was added dropwise to this mixture, the temperature being kept below -35°C. The mixture was then allowed to react at 5°C for another 12 h and warmed to RT. The reaction solution was freed from solvent under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by medium pressure chromatography over silica gel (DCM/AcCN : 25/1). Removal of the solvent gave 20.8 g (yield 45%) of pure N-benzyloxy-carbonyl-L-serine-B-lactone (see also Org. Synth. 1991 (70) Iff.) in fine needles. Empirical formula C11H1 iNO^M.W. = 221.2; MS (M+H) 222.1.<br>
Under a protective atmosphere of argon, 15.5 ml (63.51 mmol) of N,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide were added to 7.3 ml (57.36 mmol) of N-ethylaniline in 250 ml of acetonitrile, and the mixture was stirred at 50*0 for 3h. At 20°C, a solution of the above lactone (10.7 g, 48.37 mmol) dissolved in 250 ml of acetonitrile was then added, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 17 h. The solvent was removed and the residue was then admixed with saturated sodium carbonate solution, the pH of the<br><br>
f solution being kept below 9. The aqueous suspension was washed with a little diethyl ether and then acidified to a pH of from 6 to 7 using cone, hydrochloric acid, and adjusted to a pH of 5 using NaHP04 buffer. The aqueous solution was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the solvents gave the desired product in a yield of 45% {7.4 g). Empirical formula C19H22N2O4; M.W. = 342.4; MS (M+H) 343.2. At -10oC, 6.5 ml (89.1 mmol) of thionyl chloride were added dropwise to 75 ml of methanol, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. 8.6 g (25.12 mmol) of L-2-aminoethyl-3-phenylaminopropionic acid, dissolved in 75 ml of methanol, were then added and the mixture was stirred at -10°C for 30 minutes and at room temperature for a further 3 h. The solvents were evaporated and the residue was then taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with sodium carbonate solution. Evaporation of the solvent and purification by flash chromatography (n-heptan/ethyl acetate 7:3) gave 4.43 g (50% yield) of methyl L-2-aminoethyl-3-phenylaminopropionic acid. Empirical formula C20H24N2O4; M.W. = 356.4; MS (M+H) 357.3.<br>
To remove the protective group, 4.4 g (12.35 mmol) of the Z-protected derivative were dissolved in 500 ml of methanol, 100 mg of catalyst (10% Pd(OH)2-C) were added under inert gas and hydrogen was introduced until the 2 protective group had been cleaved off completely. The catalyst was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated, giving 2.8 g of L-2-aminoethyl-3-phenylaminopropionic acid (quantitative). Empirical formula C12H18N2O2; M.W. = 223.3; MS (M+H) 223.1.<br>
Process step b)<br>
0.63 g (2.64 mmol) of 2-pyridin-4-yl-1H-indole-5-carboxylic acid, prepared as in process variant B), was suspended in 150 ml of DMF and admixed successively with 1.01 g (3.08 mmol) of TOTU and 0.63 ml (3.71 mmol) of ethyldiisopropylamine. The mixture was stirred at RT for 20 min, and 0.73 g (3.28 mmol) of methyl (S)-2-amino-3-phenylaminoethylpropionate, prepared according to a), was added to the resulting clear solution. The mixture was stirred under reduced pressure for 15 h and the methyl ester of the title compound was then isolated by flash chromatography over silica gel (DCM:MeOH= 19:1). Yield: 0.44 g, empirical formula C26H26N4O3; M.W. = 442.2; MS (M+H) 443.3.<br>
0.22 g (0.497 mmol) of the resulting methyl ester was dissolved in 100 ml of methanol  and  cooled to  0°C,  and  1.5 h  of ammonia  were  then<br><br>
introduced. The solution was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and the methanol was then evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel {DCM:MeOH= 19:1). Yield: 0.096 g (45.2%), [lacuna] C25H25N5O2; M.W. = 427.2; MS (M+H) 428.3.<br>
The compounds in Table 1 below were prepared analogously to Processes A) to D).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Pharmacological Examples	IKB kinase ELISA:<br>
The activity of the IKB kinase was determined using an ELISA comprising a biotinilated substrate peptide containing the amino acid sequence in the protein IKB of serines 32 to 36 and a specific poly- or monoclonal antibody (for example from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA, cat.: 9240), which binds only to the phosphorylated form of the peptide IKB. This complex was immobilized on an antibody-binding plate (coated with protein A) and detected using a conjugate of a biotin-binding protein and HRP {for example streptavidine HRP). The activity could be quantified using a standard curve with substrate phosphopeptide.<br>
Procedure:<br>
To obtain the kinase complex, 10 ml of HeLa S3 cell extract S100 were diluted with 40 ml 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, adjusted to 40% ammonium sulfate and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The precipitated pellet was dissolved in 5 ml SEC buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-glycerophosphate), centrifuged at 20,000 xg for 15 minutes and filtered through a 0.22 jam filter. The sample was applied to a<br><br>
320 ml Superose-6 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated with SEC buffer and was operated at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 4°C. The fractions which corresponded to the elution time of the 670 kDa molecular weight standard were combined for activation. Activation was achieved by a 45-minute-incubation with 100 nM MEKK1A, 250 uM MgATP, 10 mM MgCI2, 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM 2-glycerophosphate, 2.5 uM microcystin LR at 37°C. The activated enzyme was stored at-80°C.<br>
The test substances, dissolved in DMSO (2 ul), were preincubated at 25°C with 43 uj of activated enzyme (diluted 1:25 in reaction buffer 50 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM R-glycerophosphate, 2.5 uM microcystin LR) for 30 minutes. 5 pi of substrate peptide (biotin-(CH2)6-DRHDSGLDSMKD-CONH2) (200 uM) were added, the mixture was incubated for one hour and the reaction was quenched using 150 ji! of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, 50 mM EDTA, antibody [1:200]. 100 ul of the quenched reaction mixture or a standard phosphopeptide dilution series (biotin-(CH2)6-DRHDS[P03]GLDSMKD-CONH2) were then transferred to a protein A plate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA) and incubated with shaking for 2 hours.<br>
After 3 washing steps with PBS, 100 ^il of 0.5 ng/ml of streptavidin HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (diluted in 50 mM HEPES/ 0.1% BSA) were added for 30 minutes. After 5 washing steps with PBS, 100 ul of TMB substrate (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were added and the development of color was stopped by addition of 100 jil of 0.18 M sulfuric acid. Absorption was measured at 450 nm. The standard curve was generated by linear regression according to a 4-parameter dose-activity relation. Using this standard curve, the enzyme activity or their inhibition by test substances was quantified. Method PKA, PKC, CK U<br>
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase II (CK II) were determined using the corresponding test kits of Upstate Biotechnologie according to the instructions of the manufacturer at an ATP concentration of 50 jxM. However, instead of phosphocellulose filters, multi-screen plates (Millipore; Phosphocellulose MS-PH, cat. MAPHNOB10) with the corresponding aspiration system were used. The plates were then measured in a Wallac MicroBeta scintillation counter. In each case, 100 \iM of test substance were used.<br>
Each substance was tested in duplicate. The mean of the blank (without enzyme) was subtracted from the  means  (enzyme  with  and  without<br><br>
substances), and the inhibition in % was calculated. IC50 calculations were carried out using the software package GraFit 3.0. The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
