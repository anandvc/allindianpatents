				<td>5,6-DIHYDRO-1H-PYRIDIN-2-ONE COMPOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention is directed to 5,6-dihydro-1H-pyridin-2-one compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds that are useful in treating<br>
infections by hepatitis C virus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Hepatitis C is a major health problem world-wide. The World Health<br>
Organization estimates that 170 million people are chronic carriers of the hepatitis C<br>
virus (HCV), with 4 million carriers in the United States alone. In the United States,<br>
HCV infection accounts for 40% of chronic liver disease and HCV disease is the most<br>
common cause for liver transplantation. HCV infection leads to a chronic infection<br>
and about 70% of persons infected will develop chronic histological changes in the<br>
liver (chronic hepatitis) with a 10-40% risk of cirrhosis and an estimated 4% lifetime<br>
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The CDC estimates that each year in the United<br>
States there are 35,000 new cases of HCV infection and approximately ten thousand<br>
deaths attributed to HCV disease.<br>
[0003] The current standard of care is a pegylated interferon/ribavirin<br>
combination at a cost of approximately S31,000/year. These drugs have difficult<br>
dosing problems and side-effects that preclude their use in almost half of diagnosed<br>
patients. Pegylated interferon treatment is associated with menacing flu-like<br>
symptoms, irritability, inability to concentrate, suicidal ideation, and leukocytopenia.<br>
Ribavirin is associated with hemolytic anemia and birth defects.<br>
[0004] The overall response to this standard therapy is low; approximately one<br>
third of patients do not respond. Of those who do respond, a large fraction relapses<br>
within six months of completing 6-12 months of therapy. As a consequence, the long-<br>
term response rate for all patients entering treatment is only about 50%. The<br>
relatively low response rate and the significant side-effects of current therapy anti-<br>
HCV drug treatments, coupled with the negative long term effects of chronic HCV<br>
infection, result in a continuing medical need for improved therapy. Antiviral<br>
pharmaceuticals to treat RNA virus diseases like HCV are few, and as described<br>
above are often associated with multiple adverse effects.<br>
[0005] A number of publications have described NS5B inhibitors useful in the<br>
treatment of hepatitis C infection. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.<br>
US 2008/0031852 (describing [1,2-6] pyridazinone compounds); U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. US 2006/0189602 (disclosing certain pyridazinones);<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2006/0252785 (disclosing selected<br>
heterocyclics); and International Publication Nos. WO 03/059356, WO 2002/098424,<br>
and WO 01/85172 (each describing a particular class of substituted thiadiazines).<br>
[0006] While there are, in some cases, medicines available to reduce disease<br>
symptoms, there are few drugs to effectively inhibit replication of the underlying<br>
virus. The significance and prevalence of RNA virus diseases, including but not<br>
limited to chronic infection by the hepatitis C virus, and coupled with the limited<br>
availability and effectiveness of current antiviral pharmaceuticals, have created a<br>
compelling and continuing need for new pharmaceuticals to treat these diseases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The present invention describes novel 5,6-dihydro-1H-pyridin-2-one<br>
compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful in treating<br>

benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, naphthyridinyl, and<br>
furopyridinyl. The foregoing groups, as derived from the groups listed above, may be<br>
C-attached or N-attached where such is possible. For instance, a group derived from<br>
pyrrole may be pyrrol-1-yl (N-attached) or pyrrol-2-yl (C-attached) or pyrrol-3-yl (C-<br>
attached). Further, a group derived from imidazole maybe imidazol-1 -yl (N-<br>
attached) or imidazol-2-yl (C-attached). The 4-10 membered heterocyclic may be<br>
optionally substituted on any ring carbon, sulfur, or nitrogen atom(s) by one to two<br>
oxo, per ring. An example of a heterocyclic group wherein 2 ring carbon atoms are<br>
substituted with oxo moieties is 1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholinyl. Other illustrative<br>

infection or viral-induced disease, or to cure or ameliorate the disease or infection or<br>
cause thereof. In particular, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount<br>
sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in vivo. Used in connection with an amount<br>
of a compound of the invention, the term preferably encompasses a non-toxic amount<br>
that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease, or<br>
enhances the therapeutic efficacy of or synergies with another therapeutic agent.<br>
[0045] The term a "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount of<br>
a compound of the invention or other active ingredient sufficient to result in the<br>
prevention of infection, recurrence or spread of viral infection. A prophylactically<br>
effective amount may refer to an amount sufficient to prevent initial infection or the<br>
recurrence or spread of the infection or a disease associated with the infection. Used<br>
in connection with an amount of a compound of the invention, the term preferably<br>
encompasses a non-toxic amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the<br>
prophylactic efficacy of or synergies with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent.<br>
[0046] The term "in combination" refers to the use of more than one<br>
prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents simultaneously or sequentially and in a manner<br>
that their respective effects are additive or synergistic.<br>
[0047] The term "treating" refers to:<br>
(i) preventing a disease, disorder, or condition from occurring in an<br>
animal that may be predisposed to the disease, disorder and/or condition, but has not<br>
yet been diagnosed as having it;<br>
(ii) inhibiting the disease, disorder, or condition, i.e., arresting its<br>
development; and<br>
(iii) relieving the disease, disorder, or condition, i.e., causing regression of<br>
the disease, disorder, and/or condition.<br>
[0048] The terms "R" and "S" indicate the specific stereochemical<br>
configuration of a substituent at an asymmetric carbon atom in a chemical structure as<br>
drawn.<br>
[0049] The term "rac" indicates that a compound is a racemate, which is defined<br>
as an equimolar mixture of a pair of enantiomers. A "rac" compound does not exhibit<br>
optical activity. The chemical name or formula of a racemate is distinguished from<br>
those of the enantiomers by the prefix (±)- or rac- (or racem-) or by the symbols RS<br>
and SR.<br>
[0050] The terms "endo" and "exo" are descriptors of the relative orientation of<br>
substituents attached to non-bridgehead atoms in a bicyclo[xj.z]alkane (x= y&gt;z&gt; 0).<br>
[0051] The terms "syn" and "anti" are descriptors of the relative orientation of<br>
substituents attached to bridgehead atoms in a bicyclo[xj'.z]alkane (x = y &gt; z &gt; 0).<br><br>
[0052] The term "exo" is given to a substituent (e.g., Br attached to C-2 in the<br>
example below) that is orientated towards the highest numbered bridge (z bridge, e.g.,<br>
C-7 in example below); if the substituent is orientated away from the highest<br>
numbered bridge it is given the description "endo".<br>
[0053] The term "syn" is given to a substituent attached to the highest numbered<br>
bridge (z bridge, e.g., F attached to C-7 in the example below) and is orientated<br>
towards the lowest numbered bridge (x bridge, e.g., C-2 and C-3 in example below);<br>
if the substiuent is orientated away from the lowest numbered bridge it is given the<br>
description "anti."<br><br>
[0054] The terms "cis" and "trans" are descriptors which show the relationship<br>
between two ligands attached to separate atoms that are connected by a double bond<br>
or are contained in a ring. The two ligands are said to be located cis to each other if<br>
they lie on the same side of a plane. If they are on opposite sides, their relative<br>
position is described as trans. The appropriate reference plane of a double bond is<br>
perpendicular to that of the relevant o-bonds and passes through the double bond. For<br>
a ring it is the mean plane of the ring(s).<br>
[0055] The compounds of the invention may exhibit the phenomenon of<br>
tautomerism. While Formula I cannot expressly depict all possible tautomeric forms,<br>
it is to be understood that Formula I is intended to represent any tautomeric form of<br>
the depicted compound and is not to be limited merely to a specific compound form<br>
depicted by the formula drawings. For illustration, and in no way limiting the range<br>
of tautomers, the compounds of Formula I may exist as the following:<br>
WhenX = N:<br><br>
When X = CR3:<br><br>
Or, the compounds of Formula I may exist as the following:<br>
When X = N:<br><br>
When X = CR3:<br><br>
[0056] Some of the inventive compounds may exist as single stereoisomers (i.e.,<br>
essentially free of other stereoisomers), racemates, and/or mixtures of enantiomers<br>
and/or diastereomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates and mixtures thereof<br>
are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. Preferably, the inventive<br>
compounds that are optically active are used in optically pure form.<br>
[0057] As generally understood by those skilled in the art, an optically pure<br>
compound having one chiral center (i.e., one asymmetric carbon atom) is one that<br>
consists essentially of one of the two possible enantiomers (i.e., is enantiomerically<br>
pure), and an optically pure compound having more than one chiral center is one that<br>
is both diastereomerically pure and enantiomerically pure. Preferably, the compounds<br>
of the present invention are used in a form that is at least 90% free of other<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers of the compounds, that is, a form that contains at least<br>
90% of a single isomer (80% enantiomeric excess ("e.e.") or diastereomeric excess<br>
("d.e.")), more preferably at least 95% (90% e.e. or d.e.), even more preferably at<br>
least 97.5% (95% e.e. or d.e.), and most preferably at least 99% (98% e.e. or d.e.).<br>
[0058] Additionally, the Formula I is intended to cover solvated as well as<br>
unsolvated forms of the identified structures. For example, Formula I includes<br>
compounds of the indicated structure in both hydrated and non-hydrsated forms.<br>
Other examples of solvates include the structures in combination with isopropanol,<br>
ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, pentyl acetate, acetic acid, or ethanolamine.<br>
[0059] In addition to compounds of Formula I, the invention includes<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically active metabolites, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds and metabolites.<br>
[0060] "A pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a compound that may be<br>
converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound<br>
or to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of such compound prior to exhibiting its<br>
pharmacological effect (s). Typically, the prodrug is formulated with the objective(s)<br>
of improved chemical stability, improved patient acceptance and compliance,<br>
improved bioavailability, prolonged duration of action, improved organ selectivity,<br>
improved formulation (e.g., increased hydrosolubility), and/or decreased side effects<br>
(e.g., toxicity). The prodrug can be readily prepared from the compounds of Formula<br>
I using methods known in the art, such as those described by Burger's Medicinal<br>
Chemistry and Drug Chemistry, 1, 172-178, 949-982 (1995). See also Bertolini et al,<br>

[0061] "A pharmaceutically active metabolite" is intended to mean a<br>
pharmacologically active product produced through metabolism in the body of a<br>
specified compound or salt thereof. After entry into the body, most drugs are<br>
substrates for chemical reactions that may change their physical properties and<br>
biologic effects. These metabolic conversions, which usually affect the polarity of the<br>
Formula I compounds, alter the way in which drugs are distributed in and excreted<br>
from the body. However, in some cases, metabolism of a drug is required for<br>
therapeutic effect. For example, anticancer drugs of the anti-metabolite class must be<br>
converted to their active forms after they have been transported into a cancer cell.<br>
[0062] Since most drugs undergo metabolic transformation of some kind, the<br>
biochemical reactions that play a role in drug metabolism may be numerous and<br>
diverse. The main site of drug metabolism is the liver, although other tissues may<br>
also participate.<br>
[0063] A feature characteristic of many of these transformations is that the<br>
metabolic products, or "metabolites," are more polar than the parent drugs, although a<br>
polar drug does sometime yield a less polar product. Substances with high lipid/water<br>
partition coefficients, which pass easily across membranes, also diffuse back readily<br>
from tubular urine through the renal tubular cells into the plasma. Thus, such<br>
substances tend to have a low renal clearance and a long persistence in the body. If a<br>
drug is metabolized to a more polar compound, one with a lower partition coefficient,<br>
its tubular reabsorption will be greatly reduced. Moreover, the specific secretory<br>
mechanisms for anions and cations in the proximal renal tubules and in the<br>
parenchymal liver cells operate upon highly polar substances.<br>
[0064] As a specific example, phenacetin (acetophenetidin) and acetanilide are<br>
both mild analgesic and antipyretic agents, but are transformed within the body to a<br>
more polar and more effective metabolite, p-hydroxyacetanilid (acetaminophen),<br>
which is widely used today. When a dose of acetanilide is given to a person, the<br>
successive metabolites peak and decay in the plasma sequentially. During the first<br>
hour, acetanilide is the principal plasma component. In the second hour, as the<br>
acetanilide level falls, the metabolite acetaminophen concentration reaches a peak.<br>
Finally, after a few hours, the principal plasma component is a further metabolite that<br>
is inert and can be excreted from the body. Thus, the plasma concentrations of one or<br>
more metabolites, as well as the drug itself, can be pharmacologically important.<br>
[0065] "A pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean a salt that retains<br>
the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and<br>
that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable. A compound of the invention may<br>
possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and<br>
accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic<br>
and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Exemplary<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the<br>
compounds of the present invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic<br>
base, such as salts including sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites,<br>
phosphates, monohydrogenphosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates,<br>
pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates,<br>
caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates,<br>
oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-<br>
dioates, hexyne-l,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates,<br>
dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates,<br>
xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates,<br>
lactates, y-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates,<br>
propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and<br>
mandelates.<br>
[0066] If the inventive compound is a base, the desired pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for<br>
example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an<br>
organic acid , such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a<br>
pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an a-hydroxy acid,<br>
such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic<br>
acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.<br>
[0067] If the inventive compound is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the<br>
free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or<br>
tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like.<br>
Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids,<br>
such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and<br>
cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts<br>
derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc,<br>
aluminum and lithium.<br>
[0068] In the case of agents that are solids, it is understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that the inventive compounds and salts may exist in different crystal, co-crystal, or<br>
polymorphic forms, all of which are intended to be within the scope of the present<br>
invention and specified formulas.<br>
METHODS OF TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF<br>
HEPATITIS C VIRAL INFECTIONS<br>
[0069] The present invention provides methods for treating or preventing a<br>
hepatitis C virus infection in a patient in need thereof.<br>
[0070] The present invention further provides methods for introducing a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the Formula I compound or combination of such<br>
compounds into the blood stream of a patient in the treatment and/or prevention of<br>
hepatitis C viral infections.<br>
[0071] The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a Formula I<br>
compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or hydrate,<br>
thereof in the acute or chronic treatment or prevention of an infection will vary,<br>
however, with the nature and severity of the infection, and the route by which the<br>
active ingredient is administered. The dose, and in some cases the dose frequency,<br>
will also vary according to the infection to be treated, the age, body weight, and<br>
response of the individual patient. Suitable dosing regimens can be readily selected<br>
by those skilled in the art with due consideration of such factors.<br>
[0072] The methods of the present invention are particularly well suited for<br>
human patients. In particular, the methods and doses of the present invention can be<br>
useful for immunocompromised patients including, but not limited to cancer patients,<br>
HTV infected patients, and patients with an immunodegenerative disease.<br>
Furthermore, the methods can be useful for immunocompromised patients currently in<br>
a state of remission. The methods and doses of the present invention are also useful<br>
for patients undergoing other antiviral treatments. The prevention methods of the<br>
present invention are particularly useful for patients at risk of viral infection. These<br>
patients include, but are not limited to health care workers, e.g., doctors, nurses,<br>
hospice care givers; military personnel; teachers; childcare workers; patients traveling<br>
to, or living in, foreign locales, in particular third world locales including social aid<br>
workers, missionaries, and foreign diplomats. Finally, the methods and compositions<br>
include the treatment of refractory patients or patients resistant to treatment such as<br>
resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, etc.<br>
Doses<br>
[0073] Toxicity and efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be<br>
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental<br>
animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and<br>
the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio<br>
between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed<br>
as the ratio LD50/ED50.<br>
[0074] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can<br>
be used in formulating a range of dosage of the compounds for use in humans. The<br>
dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations<br>
that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range<br>
depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.<br>
For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective<br>
dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in<br>
animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the<br>
IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal<br>
inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture; alternatively, the dose of the<br>
Formula I compound may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating<br>
plasma concentration range of the compound that corresponds to the concentration<br>
required to achieve a fixed magnitude of response. Such information can be used to<br>
more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be<br>
measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
[0075] The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested<br>
in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to<br>
use in humans. For example, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether<br>
administration of a specific therapeutic protocol is indicated, include in vitro cell<br>
culture assays in which cells that are responsive to the effects of the Formula I<br>
compounds are exposed to the ligand and the magnitude of response is measured by<br>
an appropriate technique. The assessment of the Formula I compound is then<br>
evaluated with respect to the Formula I compound potency, and the degree of<br>
conversion of the Formula I compound prodrug. Compounds for use in methods of<br>
the invention can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in<br>
humans, including but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits,<br>
hamsters, etc. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.<br>
[0076] The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a prodrug of a<br>
Formula I compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate,<br>
or hydrate thereof in the acute or chronic treatment or prevention of an infection or<br>
condition will vary with the nature and severity of the infection, and the route by<br>
which the active ingredient is administered. The dose, and perhaps the dose<br>
frequency, will also vary according to the infection to be treated, the age, body<br>
weight, and response of the individual patient. Suitable dosing regimens can be<br>
readily selected by those skilled in the art with due consideration of such factors. In<br>
one embodiment, the dose administered depends upon the specific compound to be<br>
used, and the weight and condition of the patient. Also, the dose may differ for<br>
various particular Formula I compounds; suitable doses can be predicted on the basis<br>
of the aforementioned in vitro measurements and on the basis of animal studies, such<br>
that smaller doses will be suitable for those Formula I compounds that show<br>
effectiveness at lower concentrations than other Formula I compounds when<br>
measured in the systems described or referenced herein. In general, the dose per day<br>
is in the range of from about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg, preferably about 1 to 25 mg/kg,<br>
more preferably about 5 to 15 mg/kg. For treatment of humans infected by hepatitis C<br>
viruses, about 0.1 mg to about 15 g per day is administered in about one to four<br>
divisions a day, preferably 100 mg to 12 g per day, more preferably from 100 mg to<br>
8000 mg per day.<br>
[0077] Additionally, the recommended daily dose ran can be administered in<br>
cycles as single agents or in combination with other therapeutic agents. In one<br>
embodiment, the daily dose is administered in a single dose or in equally divided<br>
doses. In a related embodiment, the recommended daily dose can be administered<br>
once time per week, two times per week, three times per week, four times per week or<br>
five times per week.<br>
[0078] In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered<br>
to provide systemic distribution of the compound within the patient. In a related<br>
embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered to produce a systemic<br>
effect in the body.<br>
[0079] In another embodiment the compounds of the invention are<br>
administered via oral, mucosal (including sublingual, buccal, rectal, nasal, or vaginal),<br>
parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, bolus injection, intraarterial, or<br>
intravenous), transdermal, or topical administration. In a specific embodiment the<br>
compounds of the invention are administered via mucosal (including sublingual,<br>
buccal, rectal, nasal, or vaginal), parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
bolus injection, intraarterial, or intravenous), transdermal, or topical administration.<br>
In a further specific embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered<br>
via oral administration. In a further specific embodiment, the compounds of the<br>
invention are not administered via oral administration.<br>
[0080] Different therapeutically effective amounts may be applicable for<br>
different infections, as will be readily known by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Similarly, amounts sufficient to treat or prevent such infections, but insufficient to<br>
cause, or sufficient to reduce, adverse effects associated with conventional therapies<br>
are also encompassed by the above described dosage amounts and dose frequency<br>
schedules.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
[0081] Specific methods of the invention further comprise the administration<br>
of an additional therapeutic agent (i.e., a therapeutic agent other than a compound of<br>
the invention). In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of<br>
the invention can be used in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent.<br>
Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to antibiotics, antiemetic agents,<br>
antidepressants, and antifungal agents, anti-inflammatory agents, antiviral agents,<br>
anticancer agents, immunomodulatory agents, a-interferons, p-interferons, ribavirin,<br>
alkylating agents, hormones, cytokines, or toll receptor-like modulators. In one<br>
embodiment the invention encompasses the administration of an additional<br>
therapeutic agent that is HCV specific or demonstrates anti-HCV activity.<br>

formulated in combination with a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase inhibitor, such<br>
as, but not limited to, ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, and<br>
prodrug thereof to improve the pharmacokinetics (e.g., increased half-life, increased<br>
time to peak plasma concentration, increased blood levels) of a Formula 1 compound<br>
that is metabolized by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Thus, the invention also<br>
encompasses a pharmaceutical composition comprising Formula I compounds of the<br>
invention and one or more cytochrome P450 monooxygenase inhibitors.<br>

carmustine, streptozocin, dacarbazine and temozolomide.<br>
[00100] The compounds of the invention and the other therapeutics agent can<br>
act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In one embodiment, a composition<br>
comprising a compound of the invention is administered concurrently with the<br>
administration of another therapeutic agent, which can be part of the same<br>
composition or in a different composition from that comprising the compounds of the<br>
invention. In another embodiment, a compound of the invention is administered prior<br>
to or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent. In a separate<br>
embodiment, a compound of the invention is administered to a patient who has not<br>
previously undergone or is not currently undergoing treatment with another<br>
therapeutic agent, particularly an antiviral agent.<br>
[00101] In one embodiment, the methods of the invention comprise the<br>
administration of one or more Formula I compounds of the invention without an<br>
additional therapeutic agent.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND DOSAGE FORMS<br>
[00102] Pharmaceutical compositions and single unit dosage forms comprising<br>
a Formula I compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or<br>
hydrate thereof, are also encompassed by the invention. Individual dosage forms of<br>
the invention maybe suitable for oral, mucosal (including sublingual, buccal, rectal,<br>
nasal, or vaginal), parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, bolus injection,<br>
intraarterial, or intravenous), transdermal, or topical administratioa Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and dosage forms of the invention typically also comprise one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Sterile dosage forms are also contemplated.<br>
[00103] In an alternative embodiment, pharmaceutical composition<br>
encompassed by this embodiment includes a Formula I compound of the invention, or<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or hydrate thereof, and at least one additional<br>
therapeutic agent. Examples of additional therapeutic agents include, but are not<br>
limited to, those listed above.<br>
[00104] The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms of the invention will<br>
typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute<br>
treatment of a disease or a related disease may contain larger amounts of one or more<br>
of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment<br>
of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller<br>
amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage<br>
form used to treat the same disease or disorder. These and other ways in which<br>
specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one another will<br>
be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington 's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990). Examples of dosage forms<br>
include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin<br>
capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms<br>
(poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols<br>
(e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal<br>
administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid<br>
suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and<br>
elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and<br>
sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to<br>
provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.<br>
[00105] Typical pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one<br>
or more carriers, excipients or diluents. Suitable excipients are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art of pharmacy, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients are<br>
provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a<br>
pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well<br>
known in the art including, but not limited to, the way in which the dosage form will<br>
be administered to a patient. For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may<br>
contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a<br>
particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage<br>
form.<br>
[00106] This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and dosage forms comprising active ingredients, since water can<br>
facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water<br>
(e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating<br>
long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the<br>
stability of formulations over time. See, e.g., Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles<br>
&amp; Practice, 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, NY, 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and<br>
heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on a<br>
formulation can be of great significance since moisture and/or humidity are<br>
commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment,<br>
and use of formulations.<br>
[00107] Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the<br>
invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients<br>
and low moisture or low humidity conditions.<br>
[00108] An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and<br>
stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous<br>
compositions are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to<br>
water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable<br>
packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose<br>
containers (e.g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.<br>
[00109] The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an<br>
active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as<br>
"stabilizers," include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH<br>
buffers, or salt buffers.<br>
[00110] Like the amounts and types of excipients, the amounts and specific<br>
types of active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as,<br>
but not limited to, the route by which it is to be administered to patients. However,<br>
typical dosage forms of the invention comprise Formula I compounds of the<br>
invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof comprise 0.1 mg to<br>
1500 mg per unit to provide doses of about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg per day.<br>
Oral Dosage Forms<br>
[00111] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention that are suitable for oral<br>
administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited<br>
to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored<br>
syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and<br>
may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See<br>
generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton<br>
PA (1990).<br>
[00112] Typical oral dosage forms of the invention are prepared by combining<br>
the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according<br>
to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For<br>
example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include, but<br>
are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and<br>
coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms<br>
(e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and cap lets) include, but are not limited to, starches,<br>
sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders,<br>
and disintegrating agents.<br>
[00113] Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent<br>
the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid excipients are<br>
employed. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy.<br>
In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly<br>
and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided<br>
solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if<br>
necessary.<br>
[00114] For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding.<br>
Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active<br>
ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with<br>
an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture<br>
of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
[00115] Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms of the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, disintegrants, and lubricants.<br>
Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include,<br>
but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and<br>
synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates,<br>
powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose,<br>
cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose),<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl<br>
cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
[00116] Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium<br>
carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose,<br>
dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions of the invention<br>
is typically present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition or dosage form.<br>
[00117] Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited<br>
to, the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AV1CEL RC-581,<br>
AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division,<br>
Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, PA), and mixtures thereof. A specific binder is a mixture<br>
of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL<br>
RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include<br>
AVICEL-PH-103™ and Starch 1500 LM.<br>
[00118] Disintegrants are used in the compositions of the invention to provide<br>
tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that<br>
contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too<br>
little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a<br>
sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally<br>
alter the release of the active ingredients should be used to form solid oral dosage<br>
forms of the invention. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of<br>
formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typical<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of<br>
disintegrant, specifically from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.<br>
[00119] Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid,<br>
calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone,<br>
polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, pre-gelatinized<br>
starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00120] Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc,<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil,<br>
olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel<br>
(AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, MD), a coagulated<br>
aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Piano, TX), CAB-O-SIL (a<br>
pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, MA), and mixtures<br>
thereof. If used at all, lubricants are typically used in an amount of less than about 1<br>
weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they<br>
are incorporated.<br>
Delayed Release Dosage Forms<br>
[00121] Active ingredients of the invention can be administered by controlled<br>
release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.:<br>
3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595,<br>
5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, each of which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow<br>
or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example,<br>
hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes,<br>
osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a<br>
combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions.<br>
Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active<br>
ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage<br>
forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules,<br>
gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.<br>
[00122] All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of<br>
improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts.<br>
Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical<br>
treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or<br>
control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release<br>
formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and<br>
increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be<br>
used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels<br>
of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.<br>
[00123] Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release<br>
an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic<br>
effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this<br>
level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to<br>
maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the<br>
dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and<br>
excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated<br>
by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water,<br>
or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
Parenteral Dosage Forms<br>
[00124] Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various<br>
routes including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus<br>
injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically<br>
bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are<br>
preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient.<br>
Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready<br>
for injection, dry and/or lyophylized products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection (reconstitutable powders),<br>
suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.<br>
[00125] Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms<br>
of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are<br>
not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to,<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles<br>
such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene<br>
glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil,<br>
peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.<br>
[001261 Compounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active<br>
ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms<br>
of the invention.<br>
Transdermal Dosage Forms<br>
[00127] Transdermal dosage forms include "reservoir type" or "matrix type"<br>
patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to<br>
permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.<br>
[00128] Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that<br>
can be used to provide transdermal and topical dosage forms encompassed by this<br>
invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on<br>
the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will<br>
be applied. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited to,<br>
water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl<br>
myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00129] Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may<br>
be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active<br>
ingredients of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist<br>
in delivering the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers<br>
include, but are not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and<br>
tetrahydrofuryl; alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide;<br>
dimethyl formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as polyvinylpyrrolidone;<br>
Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various water-soluble or insoluble<br>
sugar esters such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span 60 (sorbitan monostearate).<br>
[00130] The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the<br>
tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also<br>
be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the<br>
polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve<br>
delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or<br>
lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this<br>
regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying<br>
agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent.<br>
Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further<br>
adjust the properties of the resulting composition.<br>
Topical Dosage Forms<br>
[00131] Topical dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
creams, lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms<br>
known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th<br>
eds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical<br>
Dosage Forms, 4th ed., Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia (1985).<br>
[00132] Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that<br>
can be used to provide transdermal and topical dosage forms encompassed by this<br>
invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on<br>
the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will<br>
be applied. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited to,<br>
water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl<br>
myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00133] Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components<br>
may be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active<br>
ingredients of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist<br>
in delivering the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers<br>
include, but are not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and<br>
tetrahydrofuryl; alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide;<br>
dimethyl formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as polyvinylpyrrolidone;<br>
Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various water-soluble or insoluble<br>
sugar esters such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span 60 (sorbitan monostearate).<br>
Mucosal Dosage Forms<br>
[00134] Mucosal dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
ophthalmic solutions, sprays and aerosols, or other forms known to one of skill in the<br>
art. See, e.g.. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th eds., Mack Publishing,<br>
Easton PA (1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 4th ed., Lea &amp;<br>
Febiger, Philadelphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues<br>
within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels. In one<br>
embodiment, the aerosol comprises a carrier. In another embodiment, the aerosol is<br>
carrier free.<br>
[00135] The Formula I compounds of the invention may also be administered<br>
directly to the lung by inhalation. For administration by inhalation, a Formula I<br>
compound can be conveniently delivered to the lung by a number of different devices.<br>
For example, a Metered Dose Inhaler ("MDI") which utilizes canisters that contain a<br>
suitable low boiling propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable<br>
gas can be used to deliver a Formula I compound directly to the lung. MDI devices<br>
are available from a number of suppliers such as 3M Corporation, Aventis,<br>
Boehringer Ingelheim, Forest Laboratories, Glaxo-Wellcome, Schering Plough and<br>
Vectura.<br>
[00136] Alternatively, a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) device can be used to<br>
administer a Formula I compound to the lung (see, e.g., Raleigh et al., Proc. Amer.<br>
Assoc. Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 1999, 40, 397, which is herein incorporated<br>
by reference). DPI devices typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create<br>
a cloud of dry powder inside a container, which can then be inhaled by the patient.<br>
DPI devices are also well known in the art and can be purchased from a number of<br>
vendors which include, for example, Fisons, Glaxo-Wellcome, Inhale Therapeutic<br>
Systems, ML Laboratories, Qdose and Vectura. A popular variation is the multiple<br>
dose DPI ("MDDPI") system, which allows for the delivery of more than one<br>
therapeutic dose. MDDPI devices are available from companies such as AstraZeneca,<br>
Glaxo Wellcome, IVAX, Schering Plough, SkyePharma and Vectura. For example,<br>
capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated<br>
containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose<br>
or starch for these systems.<br>
[00137] Another type of device that can be used to deliver a Formula I<br>
compound to the lung is a liquid spray device supplied, for example, by Nadigm<br>
Corporation. Liquid spray systems use extremely small nozzle holes to aerosolize<br>
liquid drug formulations that can then be directly inhaled into the lung.<br>
[00138] In one embodiment, a nebulizer device is used to deliver a Formula I<br>
compound to the lung. Nebulizers create aerosols from liquid drug formulations by<br>
using, for example, ultrasonic energy to form fine particles that can be readily inhaled<br>
(See e.g., Verschoyle et al, British J. Cancer, 1999, 80, Suppl 2, 96, which is herein<br>
incorporated by reference). Examples of nebulizers include devices supplied by<br>
Sheffield/Systemic Pulmonary Delivery Ltd. (See, Nmer etai, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,954,047; van der Linden et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,619; van der Linden et al, U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,970,974, which are herein incorporated by reference), Aventis and Batelle<br>
Pulmonary Therapeutics.<br>
[00139] In one embodiment, an electrohydrodynamic ("EHD") aerosol device<br>
is used to deliver Formula I compounds to the lung. EHD aerosol devices use<br>
electrical energy to aerosolize liquid drug solutions or suspensions (see, e.g., Noakes<br>
et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,539; Coffee, U.S. Pat. No., 4,962,885; Coffee, PCT<br>
Application, WO 94/12285; Coffee, PCT Application, WO 94/14543; Coffee, PCT<br>
Application, WO 95/26234, Coffee, PCT Application, WO 95/26235, Coffee, PCT<br>
Application, WO 95/32807, which are herein incorporated by reference). The<br>
electrochemical properties of the Formula I compounds formulation may be important<br>
parameters to optimize when delivering this drug to the lung with an EHD aerosol<br>
device and such optimization is routinely performed by one of skill in the art. EHD<br>
aerosol devices may more efficiently delivery drugs to the lung than existing<br>
pulmonary delivery technologies. Other methods of intra-pulmonary delivery of<br>
Formula I compounds will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
[00140] Liquid drug formulations suitable for use with nebulizers and liquid<br>
spray devices and EHD aerosol devices will typically include a Formula I compound<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier is a liquid such as alcohol, water, polyethylene glycol or a<br>
perfluorocarbon. Optionally, another material may be added to alter the aerosol<br>
properties of the solution or suspension of the Formula I compound. Preferably, this<br>
material is liquid such as an alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or a fatty acid. Other methods<br>
of formulating liquid drug solutions or suspension suitable for use in aerosol devices<br>
are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Biesalski, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,112,598;<br>
Biesalski, 5,556,611, which are herein incorporated by reference) A Formula I<br>
compound can also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as<br>
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases<br>
such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
[00141] In addition to the formulations described previously, a Formula I<br>
compound can also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting<br>
formulations can be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds<br>
can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as<br>
an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble<br>
derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
[00142] Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems can be employed.<br>
Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles that can be<br>
used to deliver Formula I compounds. Certain organic solvents such as<br>
dimethylsulfoxide can also be employed, although usually at the cost of greater<br>
toxicity. A Formula I compound can also be delivered in a controlled release system.<br>
In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Sefton, CRC Crit. RefBiomed Eng., 1987,<br>
14, 201; Buchwald et al, Surgery, 1980, 88, 507; Saudekefa/., N. Engl. J. Med.,<br>
1989, 321, 574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see<br>
Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres.,<br>
Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and<br>
Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas,<br>
J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem., 1983, 23, 61; see also Levy et ah, Science,<br>
1985, 228, 190; During et ah, Ann. Neurol., 1989,25,351; Howard et al, J.<br>
Neurosurg., 71, 105 (1989). In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system<br>
can be placed in proximity of the target of the compounds of the invention, e.g., the<br>
lung, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in<br>
Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115 (1984)). Other<br>
controlled-release system can be used (see, e.g., Langer, Science, 1990, 249, 1527).<br>
[00143] Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that<br>
can be used to provide mucosal dosage forms encompassed by this invention are well<br>
known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular site or<br>
method which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be<br>
administered. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited to,<br>
water, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl<br>
myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof, which are non-toxic<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable. Examples of such additional ingredients are well<br>
known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th eds., Mack<br>
Publishing, Easton PA (1990).<br>
[00144] The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the<br>
tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, can also be<br>
adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the polarity<br>
of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery.<br>
Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or<br>
dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or<br>
more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this regard, stearates can serve<br>
as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a<br>
delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or<br>
solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the<br>
resulting composition.<br>
KITS<br>
[00145] The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or<br>
more containers comprising a Formula I compound useful for the treatment or<br>
prevention of a Hepatitis C virus infection. In other embodiments, the invention<br>
provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers comprising<br>
a Formula I compound useful for the treatment or prevention of a Hepatitis C virus<br>
infection and one or more containers comprising an additional therapeutic agent,<br>
including but not limited to those listed above, in particular an antiviral agent, an<br>
interferon, an agent which inhibits viral enzymes, or an agent which inhibits viral<br>
replication, preferably the additional therapeutic agent is HCV specific or<br>
demonstrates anti-HCV activity.<br>
[00146] The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising<br>
one or more containers comprising one or more of the ingredients of the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such<br>
container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency<br>
regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products,<br>
which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human<br>
administration.<br>
[00147] The inventive agents may be prepared using the reaction routes and<br>
synthesis schemes as described below, employing the general techniques known in the<br>
art using starting materials that are readily available. The synthesis of non-<br>
exemplified compounds according to the invention may be successfully performed by<br>
modifications apparent to those skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriately protecting<br>
interfering groups, by changing to other suitable reagents known in the art, or by<br>
making routine modifications of reaction conditions. Alternatively, other reactions<br>
disclosed herein or generally known in the art will be recognized as having<br>
applicability for preparing other compounds of the invention.<br>
Preparation of Compounds<br>
[00148] In the synthetic schemes described below, unless otherwise indicated all<br>
temperatures are set forth in degrees Celsius and all parts and percentages are by<br>
weight.<br>
[00149] Reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich<br>
Chemical Company or Lancaster Synthesis Ltd. and were used without further<br>
purification unless otherwise indicated. All solvents were purchased from<br>
commercial suppliers such as Aldrich, EMD Chemicals or Fisher and used as<br>
received.<br>
[00150] The reactions set forth below were done generally under a positive<br>
pressure of argon or nitrogen at an ambient temperature (unless otherwise stated) in<br>
anhydrous solvents, and the reaction flasks were fitted with rubber septa for the<br>
introduction of substrates and reagents via syringe. Glassware was oven dried and/or<br>
heat dried.<br>
[00151] The reactions were assayed by TLC and/or analyzed by LC-MS or HPLC<br>
and terminated as judged by the consumption of starting material. Analytical thin<br>
layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on glass-plates precoated with silica gel<br>
60 F254 0.25 mm plates (EMD Chemicals), and visualized with UV light (254 nm)<br>
and/or iodine on silica gel and/or heating with TLC stains such as ethanolic<br>
phosphomolybdic acid, ninhydrin solution, potassium permanganate solution or eerie<br>
sulfate solution. Preparative thin layer chromatography (prepTLC) was performed on<br>
glass-plates precoated with silica gel 60 F254 0.5 mm plates (20 × 20 cm, from<br>
Thomson Instrument Company) and visualized with UV light (254 nm).<br>
[00152] Work-ups were typically done by doubling the reaction volume with the<br>
reaction solvent or extraction solvent and then washing with the indicated aqueous<br>
solutions using 25% by volume of the extraction volume unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Product solutions were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and/or MgSO4 prior to filtration<br>
and evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and<br>
noted as solvents removed in vacuo. Column chromatography was completed under<br>
positive pressure using Merck silica gel 60, 230-400 mesh or 50-200 mesh neutral<br>
alumina, ISCO Flash -chromatography using prepacked RediSep silica gel columns,<br>
or Analogix flash column chromatography using prepacked SuperFlash silica gel<br>
columns. Hydrogenolysis was done at the pressure indicated in the examples or at<br>
ambient pressure.<br>
[00153] 1H-NMR spectra and 13C-NMR were recorded on a Varian Mercury-<br>
VX400 instrument operating at 400 MHz. NMR spectra were obtained as CDCI3<br>
solutions (reported in ppm), using chloroform as the reference standard (7.27 ppm for<br>
the proton and 77.00 ppm for carbon), CD3OD (3.4 and 4.8 ppm for the protons and<br>
49.3 ppm for carbon), DMSO-d6 (2.49 ppm for proton), or internally tetramethylsilane<br>
(0.00 ppm) when appropriate. Other NMR solvents were used as needed. When peak<br>
multiplicities are reported, the following abbreviations are used: s (singlet), d<br>
(doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), br (broadened), bs (broad singlet), dd<br>
(doublet of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets). Coupling constants, when given, are<br>
reported in Hertz (Hz).<br>
[00154] Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on an ATR FT-IR Spectrometer as<br>
neat oils or solids, and when given are reported in wave numbers (cm1). Mass<br>
spectra reported are (+)-ES or APCI (+) LC/MS conducted by the Analytical<br>
Chemistry Department of Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Elemental analyses were<br>
conducted by the Atlantic Microlab, Inc. in Norcross, GA. Melting points (mp) were<br>
determined on an open capillary apparatus, and are uncorrected.<br>
[00155] Enantiomeric excess (ee) values were determined by HPLC-analysis using<br>
the Chiralpak (Chiral Technologies Inc.) columns AS-RH, 2.1 x 150 mm, 5 micron, k<br>
= 312 nm or AS-RH, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 micron, ?, = 310 nm.<br>

[00159] Scheme 1 provides a general procedure that can be used to prepare<br>
saturated 5,6-dihydro-lH-pyridin-2-one compounds of Formula I.<br><br>
[00160] The saturated cyclic N-substituted-ß-amino acid ester intermediates, which<br>
can be obtained as described by one of the methods in schemes 3,4, 6, 7 or 8 can be<br>
condensed with a carboxylic acid intermediate (or a salt thereof, e.g., sodium salt)<br>
using standard peptide coupling conditions used for the formation of amide bonds,<br>
such as DCC, to yield the shown amide. This intermediate can be cyclized with or<br>
without isolation in the presence of abase (e.g., triethylamine) to give the desired<br>
saturated 5,6-dihydro-1H-pyridin-2-one compounds.<br>
[00161] Scheme 2 provides a general procedure that can be used to prepare<br>
unsaturated 5,6-dihydro-1H-pyridin-2-one compounds of Formula I.<br><br>
[00162] The unsaturated cyclic N-substituted-ß-amino acid ester intermediates<br>
(with R as defined in scheme 1), which can be obtained as described by one of the<br>
methods in schemes 5 or 9, can be condensed with a carboxylic acid intermediate (or<br>
a salt thereof, e.g., sodium salt) using standard peptide coupling conditions used for<br>
the formation of amide bonds, such as DCC, to yield the shown amide. This<br>
intermediate can be cyclized with or without isolation in the presence of a base (e.g.,<br>
triethylamine) to give the desired unsaturated 5,6-dihydro-1H-pyridin-2-one<br>
compounds.<br>
[00163] Scheme 3 provides a general procedure that can be used to prepare<br>
saturated cyclic N-substituted-ß-amino acid ester intermediates from saturated<br>
anhydrides.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
[00164] Commercially available saturated cyclic meso-anhydrides can be<br>
desymmetrized with the help of enzymes or chiral reagents, such as cinchona<br>
alkaloids (e.g., quinine or quinidine) as described in the literature to provide optically<br>
active saturated cyclic dicarboxylic acid monoesters (with R as defined in scheme 1).<br>
See J. Org. Chem., 65, 6984-6991 (2000); Synthesis, 11,1719-1730 (2001), and<br>
references cited therein.<br>
[00165] These intermediates can be further elaborated into protected optically<br>
active saturated cyclic P-amino acid esters (e.g., Cbz-protected) via a rearrangement<br>
reaction, such as the Curtius rearrangement (shown) or a Hofmann degradation.<br>
Hydrogenation of the protected saturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters under standard<br>
conditions can be used to remove the protecting group and furnish the optically active<br>
saturated cyclic P-amino acid esters, which can be isolated (and used) as either the<br>
free bases or their corresponding salts. The optically active saturated cyclic ß-amino<br>
acid esters (or their salts) can then be treated with aldehydes or ketones, where Rx and<br>
Rware independently C1-C5 alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, -C1-C5 alkylene(C3-C8<br>
cycloalkyl), -C1-C5 alkylene(aryl), -C1-C5 alkylene(heterocyclyl), aryl, or<br>
heterocyclyl, or Rw can combine with Rx to form a 3- to 8-membered ring, in the<br>
presence of a reducing agent (such as sodium cyanoborohydride) to afford the desired<br>
optically active saturated cyclic N-substituted-ß-amino acid ester intermediates.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction sequence described above can be performed without<br>
enzymes or chiral reagents leading to the corresponding achiral intermediates and<br>
products.<br>
[00166] Scheme 4 provides a general procedure that can be used to prepare<br>
saturated cyclic N-substituted-ß-amino acid ester intermediates from unsaturated<br>
anhydrides.<br><br>
[00167] Commercially available unsaturated cyclic meso-anhydrides can be<br>
desymmetrized as described above (scheme 3) to provide optically active unsaturated<br>
cyclic dicarboxylic acid monoesters (with R as defined in scheme 1). These<br>
intermediates can be further elaborated into protected optically active unsaturated<br>
cyclic ß-amino acid esters (e.g., Cbz-protected) via a rearrangement reaction, such as<br>
the Curtius rearrangement (shown) or a Hofrnann degradation. Hydrogenation of the<br>
protected optically active unsaturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters under standard<br>
conditions removes the protecting group and reduces the olefin to furnish the optically<br>
active saturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters, which can be isolated (and used) as either<br>
the free bases or their corresponding salts.<br>
[00168] The optically active saturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters (or their salts) can<br>
then be treated with aldehydes or ketones (with Rx and Rw as defined in scheme 3) in<br>
the presence of a reducing agent (such as sodium cyanoborohydride) to afford the<br>
desired optically active saturated cyclic N-substituted-ß-amino acid ester<br>
intermediates. Alternatively, the reaction sequence described above can be performed<br>
without enzymes or chiral reagents leading to the corresponding achiral intermediates<br>
and products.<br>
[00169] Scheme 5 provides a general procedure that can be used to prepare<br>
unsaturated cyclic N-substiruted-ß-amino acid ester intermediates from unsaturated<br>
anhydrides.<br><br>
[00170] Commercially available unsaturated cyclic meso-anhydrides can be<br>
desymmetrized as described above (scheme 4) to provide optically active unsaturated<br>
cyclic dicarboxylic acid monoesters (with R as defined in scheme 1). These<br>
intermediates can be further elaborated into protected optically active unsaturated<br>
cyclic ß-amino acid esters (e.g., Boc-protected) via a rearrangement reaction, such as<br>
the Curtius rearrangement (shown) or a Hofmann degradation. The Boc protecting<br>
group can then be selectively removed in the presence of the olefin, thus leading to<br>
the optically active unsaturated cyclic ß-amino acid ester intermediates, which can be<br>
isolated (and used) as either the salts or their corresponding free bases.<br>
[00171] The optically active unsaturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters (or their salts)<br>
can then be treated with aldehydes or ketones (with Rx and Rw as defined in scheme 3)<br>
in the presence of a reducing agent (such as sodium cyanoborohydride) to afford the<br>

the presence of a strong acid (such as hydrochloric acid) to afford the saturated cyclic<br>
ß-amino acids (or their salts), which can then be further elaborated into the<br>
corresponding esters using standard conditions (with Ras defined in scheme 1). The<br>
saturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters can then be treated with aldehydes or ketones<br>

solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) and treated with a base, such as sodium carbonate, to<br>
afford the free enantiomerically pure cyclic (1R,2R,3S,4S)-ß-amino acid esters. The<br>

(e.g., ethanol) to directly afford the diastereomerically pure (1R,2R,3S,4S)-ß-amino<br>

available saturated cyclic ß-amino acids, or can be prepared by the method described<br>
in schemes 3,4, 6 or 7. The saturated cyclic ß-amino acid esters can then be treated<br>

by reaction with tin(II)chloride. Subsequent reaction with a sulfonyl chloride, such as<br>
methylsulfonyl chloride, can be used to obtain the corresponding sulfonamides.<br>
Protection of both nitrogens with a suitable protecting group such as a Boc group can<br>

of an acid (e.g., methanesulfonic acid) can be used to remove the benzylic group and<br>
to reduce the nitro group at the same time to afford the 2,5-diamino-<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING<br>
[00507] The ability of compounds of Formula I to inhibit HCV replication can be<br>
demonstrated in the following in vitro assays.<br>
[00508] Compounds were tested for HCV polymerase inhibition. Assays were<br>
performed in a 96-well streptavidin-coated FlashPlate using 20 nM enzyme, 0.5 µCi<br>
of [a-33P]GTP, 0.6 µM GTP, and 250 nM 5'biotinylated oligo (rG13)/poly rC in 20<br>
raM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 g/L bovine serum<br>
albumin, and 100 U/mL RNAse inhibitor. The reaction was stopped by aspiration<br>
after 75 min at 28°C and the plate was washed several times. After washing and<br>
drying the plate, incorporated radioactivity was counted using a Microbeta<br>
scintillation counter. IC50 values were calculated relative to the uninhibited control<br>
and inhibition data were fitted to a 4-parameter IC50 equation. For very potent<br>
inhibitors, the data were fitted to a tight binding quadratic equation to obtain IC50<br>
values.<br>
[00509] Test results (IC50 values) for compounds of Formula I are summarized in<br>
Table 1, wherein ++++ means NS5B polymerase inhibition with IC50 values less than<br>
0.02 uM, +-H- means IC50 values between 0.02 uM and 0.1 µM, ++ means IC50 values<br>
between 0.1 µM and 1 µM, and + means IC50 values between 1 µM and 100 µM. Test<br>
results for Example numbers 64 and 65 in Table 1 are EC50 values, wherein ****<br>
means HCV replicon inhibition with EC50 values less than 0.02 µM, *** means EC50<br>
values between 0.02 uM and 0.1 uM, ** means EC50 values between 0.1 µM and 1<br>
µM, and * means EC50 values between 1 µM and 100 µM<br><br><br>
HCV Replicon Assay (Replicon EC50 (µM))<br>
[00510] The cell culture component of the assay is performed essentially as<br>
described by Bartenschlager et al., Hepatology 2002, 35, 694-703, wherein<br>
exponentially growing HCV Huh-7/C24 replicon cells are seeded at 4.5 * 103<br>
cells/well in 96 well plates and 24 hours later are treated with six point half-log<br>
concentration of compound. After 72 hours exposure the media is discarded from the<br>
compound assay plate and the cell monolayers are lysed by addition of 150 L lysis<br>
mixture (Genospectra) with incubation at 53 oC for 45 minutes. Following<br>
incubation, each lysate is thoroughly mixed and 5 1 (NS3 probe) or 10 L (GAPDH<br>
probe) of each lysate is then transferred to the capture plate and analyzed by bDNA<br>
assay.<br>
Branched DNA (bDNA) Assay<br>
[00511] Based on provided sequences for NS3 [AJ242652], Genospectra (Fremont,<br>
CA, USA) designed and synthesized probes to these analytes (together with GAPDH).<br>
Cellular bDNA analysis is carried out essentially as described in the Genospectra<br>
protocol (details in Shyamala, V. et al, Anal. Biochem. 1999, 266, 140-7), wherein<br>
target specific capture extenders, label extenders and blocking probes are added to the<br>
capture plate after the addition of 5 or 10 µL cell lysate. After annealing overnight,<br>
during which the target RNA is captured to the plate via interaction with the capture<br>
extenders, the plate is washed, and then amplifier (which binds via the label<br>
extenders) and label probe are sequentially added.<br>
[00512] After subsequent addition of the chemilumigenic substrate (dioxetan), each<br>
plate is read by luminometer (Wallac 1420 Multilabel HTS Counter Victor 2). The<br>
luminescence signal is proportional to the amount of mRNA present in each lysate. In<br>
addition to the samples, cell lysate only (no probe) background controls are also<br>
included on each bDNA assay plate and the average signal from these control wells is<br>
subtracted from the sample reading prior to analysis. Percent of no drug control is<br>
determined for both the NS3 and GAPDH signals for each compound also. Percent<br>
inhibition is determined for each compound concentration in relation to the no drug<br>
control to calculate the EC50.<br>
Luciferase-based HCV Replicon Assay Protocol<br>
[00513] Exponentially growing HCV Huh-luc/neo-ET replicon cells were seeded at<br>
6 x 103 cells/well in 96 well assay plate. 24 hours later the cells were treated with<br>
various concentrations of compound in triplicate. After 72 hours exposure to the<br>
compound the luciferase activity in the wells was determined using Bright-Glo<br>
reagent (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) with a luminometer (Wallac 1420 Multilabel<br>
HTS Counter Victor 2). The background control was replicon cells treated with 100<br>
