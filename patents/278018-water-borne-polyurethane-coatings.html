				<td>WATER-BORNE POLYURETHANE COATINGS<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH<br>
[0001]	This invention was made with Government support under Contract No.<br>
FA8650-05-C-5010 awarded by the United States Air Force. The United States Government may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention is directed to water-borne polyurethane coating<br>
compositions. More particularly, the invention is directed to water-borne polyurethane coating compositions with reduced volatile organic components suitable for use in aerospace applications, among others.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Various articles, such as aviation and aerospace vehicles, are often coated<br>
to achieve properties such as solvent resistance, fuel and hydraulic fluid resistance,<br>
weather resistance, abrasion resistance, hardness, and/or aesthetics. To that end,<br>
polyurethane coatings have been used which generally include activators, base<br>
components and thinners. Typically, the activator is an organic polyisocyanate, the base<br>
component is a hydroxyl-containing polymeric resin, and the thinner is a solvent<br>
mixture. To achieve high performance, which is required for aerospace applications by<br>
way of example, large amounts of solvent are used to balance film properties with<br>
appearance and aesthetics. The use of such large amounts of solvent, however, yields<br>
large amounts of volatile organic components ("VOC's), i.e. about 420 g/L in a typical<br>
solvent-borne formulation according to the Environmental Protection Agency's<br>
calculation method. Reductions in the amount of VOCs used in these formulations are<br>
desirable for ecological and economic reasons, as well as to comply with ever-changing<br>
governmental standards. Therefore, efforts have been made to replace the organic<br>
solvents in solvent-borne polyurethane coating compositions with water.<br>
[0004]	To reduce the amount of VOCs in polyurethane coatings, water-borne<br>
polyurethane coatings have been developed. However, thus far, water-borne<br>
polyurethane coatings have been unable to match the high performance of solvent-borne coatings. The performance of water-borne polyurethane coatings suffers because the water-borne polyol resin used in the coatings is dispersed in water for storage prior to combination with the activator. The water-borne polyol resin often has low molecular weight and many ester linkages, making it susceptible to hydrolysis over time. Hydrolysis decreases the overall molecular weight of the resin, yielding lower molecular weight products exhibiting poor impact resistance, pot-life, gloss, and the like. In addition, the hydrolysis rate is difficult to control under different conditions such as batch number, pH, and storage time, resulting in significant variations in film performance.<br>
[0005]	Also, water-borne polyurethane coatings are often prepared by high shear<br>
mixing a water-borne polyol resin with a hydrophilic isocyanate. High shearing energy is needed to intimately mix the hydrophilic isocyanate with the polyol resin. To overcome me barrier between the polyol resin colloid and the isocyanate, high shear energy is used to facilitate the migration of the isocyanate into a micelle of the polyol resin. The curing reaction thus occurs inside the new micelle to form the water-borne polyurethane coating composition. However, high shear mixing uses equipment, such as dissolver mixers and jet dispersing spray guns, that require high pressure and high shearing energy to intimately mix the isocyanate and polyol components. This equipment is not available for many applications; for example, the equipment is not available for fast field repair of, for example, automobiles as well as aviation and aerospace vehicles.<br>
[0006]	Finally, the polyol components of conventional water-borne polyurethane<br>
coatings include dispersions of polyols in water. As discussed above, such dispersions produce unstable polyol components because the polyols may hydrolyze into small molecules. Also, dispersion of the polyols in water makes high shear mixing necessary. In addition, polyol components often include pigments and other additives, such as aluminum powder, that are not stable in aqueous phases under storage conditions. These pigments and additives may react with water, limiting the development of the water-borne coating and adversely affecting the performance of the coating.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	The present invention provides water-borne polyurethane coating<br>
compositions comprising, in one embodiment, a substantially water-free base component, an activator and water. The substantially water-free base component includes a polyol resin, and the activator includes an isocyanate. The combination of isocyanate and polyol components are just hydrophilic enough to be dispersed in an aqueous phase and form a stable dispersion for water resistance. If the components are too hydrophilic, water resistance of the cured coating will be too high and not suitable for high performance coating applications.<br>
[0008]	The substantially water-free base component includes at least a<br>
hydrophilic polyol resin, which can be any hydrophilic polyol resin. Nonlimiting<br>
examples include hydrophilic polyester polyols, hydrophilic polyether polyols,<br>
hydrophilic polyurethane polyols, hydrophilic alkyd polyols, hydrophilic caprolactone<br>
polyols, and hydrophilic acrylic polyols. According to another embodiment, the<br>
substantially water-free base component includes a mixture of hydrophobic and<br>
hydrophilic polyol resins. In this embodiment, the hydrophilic polyol resin may be<br>
present in the base component in an amount of at least about 10wt%.<br>
[0009]	The activator may be any suitable isocyanate. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, the activator includes at least a hydrophobic isocyanate component. In another embodiment, the activator includes a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic isocyanate components. When a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic isocyanate components are used, the hydrophobic isocyanate component is present in an amount of at least about 30wt%.<br>
[0010]	The coating compositions of the present invention, in certain<br>
embodiments, are tfiree-component systems wherein the substantially water-free base component, activator and water are stored separately and are not combined until shortly before application. Because the polyol base component is stored in a substantially water-free environment, the polyol resins do not hydrolyze, thereby extending shelf stability and improving coating quality. To create such coating compositions, the polyol base component is first mixed with the activator component. Water is added after thoroughly mixing the base component and activator component to facilitate reaction of the two<br>
components. Thorough mixing of the base component and activator component improves curing and film formation, and imparts performance characteristics comparable to solvent-borne polyurethane coating compositions.<br>
[0011]	Although the water thins the composition, its primary purpose is to<br>
disperse the polyols of the base component and the isocyanates of the activator to<br>
facilitate reaction of these components. After mixing the base component, isocyanate<br>
and water, an additional thinning agent may be added to adjust the viscosity of the<br>
coating to enable easy application. This additional thinning agent may be a solvent or<br>
more water, though if a solvent is used, it is desirably only used up to an amount at<br>
which the content of VOCs in the coating composition remains low, i.e., below about<br>
100 g/L in one embodiment, below about 70 g/L in another embodiment, and below<br>
about 50 g/L in yet another embodiment. To further minimize the amount of VOCs in<br>
me coating composition, water may be used as the thinning agent.<br>
[0012]	The water-borne coating compositions according to, certain embodiments<br>
of the present invention, exhibit performance characteristics far superior to previous water-borne compositions and comparable to their solvent-borne counterparts. In addition, certain embodiments of the inventive water-borne coating compositions have remarkably reduced VOCs and can be mixed manually, eliminating me need for high shear mixing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]	Water-borne polyurediane coating compositions useful for aviation,<br>
aerospace, automotive, industrial, and architectural applications, by way of example, are provided. The compositions are low in VOCs and exhibit performance characteristics comparable to tiiose of solvent-borne polyurediane coating compositions. In one embodiment, a water-borne polyurethane coating composition is a tiiree-component system including a substantially water-free base component, an activator and water. The substantially water-free base component includes polyol resin(s) and the activator component includes isocyanate(s). In one embodiment, the polyol resin(s) are substantially anhydrous, but in an alternate embodiment, the polyol resin(s) are completely anhydrous. The term "substantially water-free" as used herein means that me<br>
ingrethents in the base component are not dispersed in water. The term "three-component system" is known in the art and refers to the separate storage of the base component and activator prior to application. The three components of the mixture are not combined until shortly before application.<br>
[0014]	The substantially water-free base component of the coating includes at<br>
least a hydrophilic polyol resin. In an alternate embodiment, however, the substantially water-free base component includes a mixture of hydrophilic polyol resins or a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polyol resins. When the substantially water-free base component includes a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polyol resins, the hydrophilic polyol resins may be present in the base component in an amount of at least about 10wt% based on the total weight of the base component. For example, in one embodiment, the hydrophilic polyol resin is present in an amount ranging from about 10 to 80wt% based on the total weight of the base component, and the hydrophobic polyol resin is present in an amount ranging from about 20 to 90wt% based on the total weight of the base component.<br>
[0015]	In one embodiment, the hydrophilic polyol includes hydrophilic groups<br>
capable of rendering the polyol resin water-dispersible. Such hydrophilic polyols are well known in the art, and the hydrophilic groups can be ionic water-dispersing groups or non-ionic water-dispersing groups. The ionic water-dispersing groups may be anionic groups, nonionic groups, or a combination of anionic and nonionic groups. Cationic groups may also be used in some cases. Nonlimiting examples of suitable anionic water-dispersing groups include carboxylic groups, phosphonic groups, sulphonic acid groups, and combinations thereof. Nonlimiting examples of suitable non-ionic water-dispersing groups include polyalkylene oxide groups, for example, polyediylene oxide groups. One exemplary water-soluble resin is one having carboxyl groups, but such a group must be neutralized to an alkali salt to make it soluble in water. If a combination of anionic water-dispersing groups and non-ionic water-dispersing groups are used, neutralization may not be required. The polyol resin contains a sufficient concentration of bound hydrophilic water-dispersing groups to render the oligomer self-water-dispersible. However, to prevent compromising the water sensitivity of the final coating product, the<br>
concentration of the water-dispersing groups is kept below a level at which the oligomer would have an unacceptably high water solubility.<br>
[0016]	The hydrophilic polyol resin may be any suitable hydrophilic resin, and<br>
includes both hydroxyl groups and carboxylic groups. Nonlimiting examples of suitable hydrophilic polyol resins include polyesters, polyethers, alkyds, polyurethanes, caprolactones and acrylic polyols. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic polyol resin has a OH (hydroxyl) number ranging from about 20 to 120 mg of KOH per gram of sample, such as about 30 to 100 mg of KOH per gram of sample. Also, the hydrophilic polyol resin, in certain embodiments, has an acid number ranging from about 10 to 90 mg of KOH per gram of sample, such as about 20 to 80 mg of KOH per gram of sample, or, in some cases, about 30 to 70 mg of KOH/g.<br>
[0017]	In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic polyol is prepared by a two-step<br>
process involving first preparing a hydrophobic hydroxyl-containing polyol having a OH number ranging from about 50 to 300 mg of KOH per gram of sample, such as about 100 to 250 mg of KOH per gram of sample. The hydrophobic hydroxyl-containing polyol also, in certain embodiments, has an acid number of less than about 5 mg of KOH per gram of sample. The hydrophobic hydroxyl-containing polyol is reacted with an anhydride to yield the desired hydrophilic polyol having a OH value ranging from about 20 to 120 mg of KOH per gram of sample and an acid number ranging from about 10 to 90 mg KOH per gram of sample. The anhydride is used in an amount sufficient to yield a polyol having the desired acid number. Any anhydride usually used for such a reaction may be used. Nonlimiting examples of suitable anhydrides include hexahydrophthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and mixtures thereof.   In one embodiment, the anhydride is an anhydride of a cycloaliphatic polycarboxylic acid, such as hexahydrophthalic anhydride. As an alternative to being reacted with carboxylic anhydrides, the acid groups can be incorporated in the polyol using dimethylolpropionic acid or the like.<br>
[0018]	When used, the hydrophobic polyol resin may be any suitable<br>
hydrophobic polyol resin, nonlimiting examples of which include polyesters, polyethers, polyurethanes, alkyd resins, caprolactones and acrylic polyols containing hydroxyl groups and acid groups. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic polyol resin has a OH<br>
number ranging from about 50 to 300 mg of KOH per gram of sample, such as about 100 to 200 mg of KOH per gram of sample. Also, the hydrophobic polyol resin, in certain embodiments, has an acid number ranging from about 0 to 5 mg of KOH per gram of sample.<br>
[0019]	Although the ingrethents of the base component are not dispersed in water<br>
when stored prior to combination with the activator component, the base component<br>
must be water-dispersible in order to properly react with me activator to form a coating<br>
composition. To make the substantially water-free base component dispersible in water,<br>
the hydrophilic groups are neutralized with a tertiary amine, an inorganic base, or<br>
ammonia. Nonlimiting examples of suitable tertiary amines include triethylamine, N,N-<br>
thethylethanolamine, trimethyl amine, and N,N-dimethylethanolamine. Nonlimiting<br>
examples of suitable inorganic bases include alkali hydroxides and carbonates, such as<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate.<br>
[0020]	When a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polyol resins are used as<br>
the substantially water-free base component, the base component is prepared by admixing the hydrophobic polyol resin with the hydrophilic resin to provide the desired polyol admixture. In addition to the polyol binder, me base component may further include a solvent, a catalyst, a pigment, an additive, or the like. In addition to being added to the base component, solvent may be added to the activator, as discussed further below.<br>
[0021]	When solvent is added to either the base component or the activator, it is<br>
often desirable to only use relatively small amounts in order to minimize the VOCs in the resulting coating composition. The added solvent often serves to reduce viscosity, control film formation, and/or eliminate certain film defects. For example, the added solvent can wet the primer surface, lower the surface tension of me coating, dissolve the binder resin of the coating, facilitate mixing, control film formation, provide an environment for the curing reaction, and/or adjust application time and pot-life of me resulting coating. Nonlimiting examples of suitable organic solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, and esters. Nonlimiting examples of suitable aliphatic hydrocarbons include hexane, heptane, octane, and the like. Nonlimiting examples of suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene, toluene,<br>
xylene, and the like. Nonlimiting examples of suitable ketones include methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl hexyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone, and the like. Nonlimiting examples of suitable esters include ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, amyl acetate, 2-ethylhexyl acetate, and the like. A mixture of solvents may be used to optimize coating characteristics such as adhesion and appearance properties. When used, the solvent is sometimes present in an amount ranging from about 1 to 3 weight percent, such as about 1 to 2 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coating composition.<br>
[0022]	The coating composition may further include conventional additives for<br>
coating compositions, such as pigments, fillers, UV absorbers, flow aids, rheology control agents, and catalysts for the curing reaction. Catalysts promote the curing reaction and may be tertiary amines, metal compound catalysts, or combinations thereof. Nonlimiting examples of suitable tertiary amine catalysts include triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, triethylenediamine, pyridine, picoline, and the like. Nonlimiting examples of suitable metal compound catalysts include compounds of lead, zinc, cobalt, titanate, iron, copper, and tin. For example, the metal compound catalyst may be lead 2-ethylhexoate, zinc 2-ethylhexoate, cobalt naphthenate, tetraisopropyl titanate, iron naphthenate, copper naphthenate, dibutyl tin diacetate, dibutyl tin dioctate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, and the like.<br>
[0023]	When used, the catalyst is present in a total amount ranging from about<br>
0.001 to 0.05 weight percent based on the total weight of the resin solids in the coating composition. For example, the catalyst may be present in an amount ranging from about 0.005 to 0.02 weight percent based on the total weight of the resin solids in the coating composition.<br>
[0024]	The term "pigment" includes fillers and extenders as well as conventional<br>
pigments. Pigments are particulate materials which impart color or opacity to the final coating composition. Extenders and fillers are usually inorganic materials which can be used to reduce the cost of a formulation or to modify its properties. Nonlimiting examples of suitable pigments include carbon black, titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, ferric oxide, aluminum silicate, barium sulfate, and color pigments. When used, the pigments are sometimes present in an amount ranging from about 10 to 50<br>
weight percent, such as about 20 to 40 weight percent, based on the total solids weight of the coating composition.<br>
[0025]	The activator includes at least a hydrophobic isocyanate. However, in an<br>
alternative embodiment, the activator can include a mixture of hydrophilic and<br>
hydrophobic isocyanates. The hydrophobic isocyanate has two or more isocyanate<br>
groups, i.e. die isocyanate may be selected from dimers, trimers, adducts, polymeric and<br>
prepolymeric isocyanates. The hydrophobic isocyanate may include aromatic<br>
isocyanates, aliphatic isocyanates, or combinations thereof. Nonlimiting examples of<br>
suitable aromatic isocyanates include toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-diisocyanate,<br>
4,4'-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, 2,4'-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, polymeric<br>
methylene diisocyanate, p-phenylene diisocyanate, m-phenylene diisocyanate,<br>
naphthalene 1,5-diisocyanate, naphthalene 2,4-diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene<br>
diisocyanate, p-xylylene diisocyanate, and the like. Nonlimiting examples of suitable<br>
aliphatic isocyanates include isophorone diisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate,<br>
4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, bis(isocyanatomethyl) cyclohexane,<br>
tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, and the like. Many<br>
of these isocyanates are commercially available from companies such as Bayer<br>
Corporation, BASF, ICI, Dow, Huntsman, and Degussa.<br>
[0026]	Nonlimiting examples of suitable hydrophilic isocyanates include<br>
isocyanates containing polyethylene oxide groups, sulphonate salt groups, or the like.<br>
These isocyanates may also be selected from dimers, trimers, adducts, polymeric and<br>
prepolymeric isocyanates. Suitable hydrophilic isocyanates are commercially available<br>
from companies such as Bayer Corporation, BASF, ICI, Dow, Huntsman, and Degussa.<br>
For example, suitable commercial products include Bahydur 302, XP7156, VPLS2319,<br>
VPLS2336, XP2570, all of which are commercially available from Bayer Corporation.<br>
[0027]	As noted above, a small amount of organic solvent may be added to the<br>
activator component to adjust viscosity. Suitable solvents for this purpose are the same as diose listed above in connection with die base component. When used, the solvent is present in die activator component up to an amount sufficient to render a coating composition wim an amount of VOCs less than about 100 g/L in one embodiment, less than about 70 g/L in anodier embodiment, and less than about 50 g/L in yet another<br>
embodiment. In one embodiment, for example, the solvent may be present in the activator component in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to 1% by weight based on the total weight of the polyisocyanates<br>
[0028]	The amounts of the base component and activator component in the<br>
coating composition are selected such that a ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups ranges from about 3:1 to 1:1, such as about 2:1 to 1:1.<br>
[0029]	In addition to the substantially water-free base component and activator<br>
component, in some embodiments the water-borne polyurethane coating further comprises a thinning agent. The thinning agent serves to adjust application viscosity and provides an environment for film formation and curing. In one embodiment, die thinning agent contains at least a rheology controlling additive. If desired, however, the thinning agent can also contain auxiliary substances and additives, one or more acrylic polyol emulsions, and organic solvents.<br>
[0030]	To prepare the water-borne polyurethane coating composition, the base<br>
component and activator component, and if used, the thinning agent, are mixed by a<br>
simple mechanical mixing process or by hand mixing. The individual components are<br>
maintained separately until shortly prior to application. The activator component and<br>
base component are mixed first, followed by the addition of the thinning agent, when<br>
used, resulting in an emulsion micelle containing both isocyanates and polyols.<br>
[0031]	The coating compositions of the present invention can be applied using<br>
any suitable coating method, and can be applied to any suitable dry film thickness.<br>
[0032]	For example, in certain embodiments, die coating composition is applied<br>
to a dry film thickness ranging from about 1 mil to 6 mils. In one embodiment, the coating composition is applied to a dry film thickness ranging from about 2 mils to 4 mils.<br>
[0033]	The coating compositions of the present invention can be applied by<br>
brushing, spraying, dipping, rolling, flowing, and the like. Upon application, film formation can be achieved with or without heating. The coating composition develops excellent film performance after being cured at ambient temperature for at least about one week, or for about 24 hours at 60°C. In certain embodiments, the coating composition is dry to tape in from about 8 to 24 hours.<br>
[0034]	The coating compositions of the present invention may be applied to any<br>
suitable substrates, often on a primer and may be used as a topcoat, basecoat, or clearcoat. Alternatively, the coating compositions may be used as a one-coat system, eliminating the need for a separate topcoat, basecoat and/or clearcoat.<br>
[0035]	Suitable substrates include, without limitation, metallic and polymeric<br>
substrates. Suitable metallic substrates include, but are not limited to, foils, sheets, or workpieces constructed of, for example, cold rolled steel, stainless steel and steel surface-treated with any of zinc metal, zinc compounds and zinc alloys (including electrogalvanized steel, hot-dipped galvanized steel, GALVANNEAL steel, and steel plated with zinc alloy), copper, magnesium, and alloys thereof, aluminum alloys, zinc-aluminum alloys such as GALFAN, GALVALUME, aluminum plated steel and aluminum alloy plated steel substrates may also be used. Also, suitable metallic substrates include silver, gold, and alloys thereof.<br>
[0036]	Examples of suitable polymeric substrates are polystyrene, polyamides,<br>
polyesters, polyethylene, polypropylene, melamine resins, polyacrylates,<br>
polyacrylonitrile, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
polyvinyl acetates, polyvinylpyrrolidones and corresponding copolymers and block<br>
copolymers, biodegradable polymers and natural polymers - such as gelatin.<br>
[0037]	As will be appreciated, the present invention is also directed to substrates<br>
at least partially coated with a coating deposited from a coating composition of the present invention, as well as related methods for coating a substrate utilizing a coating composition of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0038]	The following non-limiting examples illustrate exemplary compositions<br>
of water-borne polyurethane coating compositions according to the present invention. In the examples and comparative examples, the raw materials listed in the following Table 1 can be described as shown:<br>
Table 1 (Table Removed) <br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES<br>
[0039]	The water-borne coating compositions according to Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 2 below were prepared by separately preparing and storing the base<br>
component, the activator component and the thinning agent. Shortly before application of the coating composition, the base component was mixed with the activator component using high shear mixing equipment. The dunning agent was then added and die mixture was mixed again. The resulting composition was applied by, for example, spraying it through a HVLP (high volume, low pressure) spray gun onto an aluminum substrate coated widi CA7700 primer available from PRC-DeSoto Int., Inc.<br>

TESTING AND RESULTS<br>
[0050]	As shown in the above Examples, the VOC level of the resulting coating<br>
composition may be controlled by adjusting the amounts and contents of the base component, activator component and thinning agent. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the coating compositions have VOC levels of less than about 100 g/L, for example, as shown in Example 6. In other embodiments, the coating compositions have VOC levels of less than about 70 g/L, for example, as shown in Examples 2, 3,4 and 7. In yet other embodiments, the coating compositions have VOC levels of less than about 50 g/L, for example, as shown in Examples 1 and 5.<br>
[0051]	The Examples and Comparative Examples were tested to ascertain<br>
various performance characteristics, including tape adhesion, haze and specular gloss (measured at incident angles of 20° and 60°), MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) resistance, set-to-touch time, impact resistance, hot water resistance and skydrol resistance. In addition, the NVM percentage and VOC level in g/L were determined for each Example and Comparative Example. The NVM percentage was determined according to ASTM D2369, and the VOC level was determined according to ASTM D3960. The NVM percentages and VOC levels for the Examples and Comparative Examples are reported above.<br>
Tape Adhesion<br>
[0052]	Tape adhesion was determined according to ASTM D3359 and the results<br>
are reported in Table 11. Table 11<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
<br>
Haze and Specular Gloss<br>
[0053]	Haze and Specular Gloss were determined according to ASTM E430 and<br>
D523 using a BYK-Gardner Haze-Gloss and the results are reported in Table 12.<br>
Table 12<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
<br>
MEK Resistance<br>
[0054]	MEK resistance was determined according to ASTM D5402 over<br>
200 MEK double rubs, and the results are reported in Table 13.<br>
Table 13<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
<br>
Set to Touch Time<br>
[0055]	Set-to-touch time was determined according to ASTM D1640 and the<br>
results are reported in Table 14.<br>
Table 14<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Impact Resistance<br>
[0056]	Impact resistance was determined according to ASTM D2794 using a<br>
BYK-Gardner Impact Tester and the results are reported in Table 15.<br>
Table 15<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
<br>
Hot Water Resistance<br>
[0057]	Hot water resistance was determined according to ASTM D870. Each<br>
sample was immersed in deionized water at 158°F for 24 hours. The results are reported in Table 16. Table 16<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Skydrol Resistance<br>
[0058]	Skydrol resistance was determined according to ASTM D870. Each<br>
sample was immersed in Skydrol LD-4 hydraulic fluid (available from Solutia, Inc.) at 158°F for 24 hours. The results are reported in Table 17.<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
 [0059]	As seen from the test results, the water-borne coating compositions<br>
according to Examples 1 through 7 have dramatically reduced VOC levels compared to Comparative Example 1, which includes a base component dispersed in water. In addition, the water-borne compositions according to Examples 1 tiirough 7 have significantly improved performance characteristics. For example, the water-borne compositions according to Examples 1 though 7 exhibit surprisingly better impact resistance and specular gloss than the compositions according to Comparative Examples 1 and 2. Also, although the composition according to Comparative Example 2 has a lower VOC level, it exhibits much poorer performance characteristics as compared to the compositions according to Examples 1 through 7. The compositions according to Examples 1 through 7 were able to couple a very low VOC level wim excellent performance characteristics, a feat previously unattainable in a water-borne coating composition.<br>
[0060]	Moreover, the water-borne coating compositions according to Examples 1<br>
through 7 exhibit performance characteristics similar to those of conventional solvent-borne coating compositions. In particular, one commercially available solvent-borne coating composition is CA8000, available from PRC-DeSoto Int., Inc. The haze and 20° Specular gloss, at 10.5/83.6, of this solvent-borne coating composition are very similar to the values reported above for the water-borne compositions according to Examples 1<br>
through 7. Also, the impact resistance of this solvent-borne composition, at 100/100 in-lb, is the same as that reported for the water-borne compositions according to Examples 1 through 7. Accordingly, the water-borne compositions of the present invention not only have reduced VOCs, but also dramatically improved performance characteristics as compared to conventional water-borne compositions, at last matching the performance of their solvent-borne counterparts and meeting the high performance requirements of the aerospace industry, for example.<br>
[0061]	The present invention has been described with reference to exemplary<br>
embodiments and aspects, but is not limited thereto. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that other modifications and applications can be made without meaningfully departing from the invention. For example, the coating compositions are described as being mixed by a simple mechanical mixing process, or by hand mixing. However, it is understood mat other mixing processes may also be used to mix the coating compositions of the present invention. Also, although the coating compositions are described as being useful for aerospace applications, they may be useful for other applications as well. Accordingly, the foregoing description should not be read as limited to the precise embodiments and aspects described, but should be read consistent with and as support for the following claims, which are to have their fullest and fairest scope.<br>
[0062]	Throughout the text and the claims, use of the word "about" in relation to<br>
a range of values is intended to modify both the high and low values recited, and reflects the penumbra of variation associated with measurement, significant figures, and interchangeability, all as understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
