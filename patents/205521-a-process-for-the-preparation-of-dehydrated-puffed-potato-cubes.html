This invention relates to a process for the preparation of dehydrated potato cubes.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for the preparation of dehydrated puffed potato cubes.<br>
Ready to cal puffed potato cube is basically a crispy putted and dehydrated product developed form diced potato consisting of a crispy shell and completely hollow core. It can have a salty or a combination of sweet and salty taste which can be consumed directly or added with spice and flavour as desired. It can also be added to various soups and other dishes where crispness is desired. It does not need any oil treatment if not specially desired and thus, is a low fat hygienic snack food. The natural colour of the product is creamy or light brown. However, if any particular colour is desired, the colouring agent can be added. It is there fore an object of this invention to propose a process for the preparation of dehydrated puffed potato cubes which is extra crisp and ready    for   consumption.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to propose a process for the preparation of dehydrated puffed potato  cubes with a safe storage moisture content.<br>
According to this invention it involves a process for the preparation of dehydrate puffed potato cubes comprising the steps of peeling c1eaned raw potatoes and subjecting the same to the steps of dicing followed by blanching and treatment with chemicals such as herein described and partial dehydration followed by a high temperature  short  time dehydration-cum-puffing treatment to<br>
abstain the  puffed  potato cubes,<br><br>
-2-<br>
subjecting the puffed potato cubes to a step of further dehydration and oven toasting to obtain dehydrated puffed potato cubes. in accordance with this invention, cleaned raw potato is first peeled and then subjected to stepwise unit operations such as dicing, blanching, partial dehydration followed by high temperature short time dehydration treatment. Puffed potato cubes, thus obtained, are subjected to further dehydration at a comparatively<br><br>
low temperature to a safe storage moisture content and subsequently oven toasted to render crispness.<br>
Cleaned potatoes, preferably freshly harvested, are peeled either mechanically or chemically. The peeled potatoes are then diced with suitable device into a desired size and shape preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 cm. The diced potato cubes are subjected to either  hot water blanching, steam blanching or individual  quick<br>
blanching.  For hot water blanching, the potato cubes are  soaked<br>
in hot water at a temperature between 70-100oC for a duration  of<br>
1-15  minutes,  added with the desired chemicals such  as  sodium<br>
meta—bi—sulphite    (0. 1-0.3%) ,    sodium-bi-sulphite    (0.1 — 0. 5%),    and<br>
calcium   chloride    (0.5-2.5%)   of   the   solution.   For   steam   blanching,<br>
open      steaming   of    the   potato   cubes   is   done    in   chamber   for   60-120<br>
seconds.    Depending   upon   steam   pressure   used   and   steaming      chamber<br>
design,      steaming    time    is   varied.    For   individual    quick      blanching<br>
under      fluidized   or   whirling   bed,    either   steam   or   mixture   of      hot<br>
air    and   steam    is   used   depending   upon    the    requirement   of      tempera-<br>
ture,       varying   between    70-90oC    for   60-160   seconds.    Potato      cubes,<br>
after   subjected    in    either   steam   or    individual    quiet   blanching   are<br>
added   with    a    solution   of   above   mentioned   chemicals    for    a   duration<br><br>
-3-<br>
of 1-5 minutes.<br>
The blanched potato cubes thus obtained are   dehydrated by hot air<br>
for 30-300 minutes at 50-90oC with an air velocity of 0.5-2.5 m/s<br>
to decrease the moisture content to 25-65% (wet basis), the  partially dried potato cubes are   subjected to high  temperature short time (HTST) dehydration-cum-puffing in a fluidized bed<br>
or  modified  fluidized bed (whirling bed) chamber with  hot  air<br>
temperature 150-280oC for 20-150 seconds with a superficial hot air velocity ranging between 2-10 m/s. The  partially  dehydrated puffed potato cubes are  then  further<br>
dried  with  hot air either in fixed bed or   fluidized  bed  at  a<br>
temperature between 50—70oC with air velocity ranging between 1-b<br>
m/s for 40-80 minutes up to a safe storage  moisture  content<br>
between 6-10% (wet basis).<br>
The  puffed  and dehydrated potato cubes are  then  subjected  to<br>
toasting either in oven or   some other device at 90-150oC for 5-30<br>
minutes  to impart crispness. The final moisture content  of  the<br>
product  is about 3-5% (wet basis), bulk density of 150-180  kg/m<br>
and the volume expansion is about 1.0-1.5 times to that of  fresh<br>
potato cubes.<br>
The  product thus obtained is cooled to atmospheric  temperature<br>
and packed with a suitable packaging material.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with  refe-<br>
rence  to  the  accompanying drawing of  a flow  chart  of  the<br>
process  showing  the steps of cleaning  raw  potatoes,  peeling,<br>
dicing,  blanching, partial dehydration, short time  dehydration,<br>
drying,  toasting  and cooling to obtain  the  dehydrated  puffed<br>
potato cubes.<br><br>
