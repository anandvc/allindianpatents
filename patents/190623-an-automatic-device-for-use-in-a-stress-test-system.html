				<td>This invention relates to an automatic device for use in a stress test system.<br>
The stress test is conducted on heart patients or probable heart patients. The patients are subjected to a standard protocol of graded exercise programme and a tread mill is available for this purpose to walk and run. The stress test system is used to acquire, monitor, analyse and document the electrocardiogram (ECG) of the person.<br>
The existing stress test systems generally comprise of a 12 channel amplifier, 12 channel filter, A/D converter, a host processor with necessary Input/output devices. The existing stress test system can be broadly classified into two category. The first category of the stress test system are those in which the computer is a dedicated system. These systems use dedicated integrated circuits (ICs) for amplification, filtering, A/D conversion and use high speed digital signal processor (s) with its own input/output devices. These systems are expensive due to customised ICs. The host computer of the system is dedicated to the stress test analysis and is not available for any other application. This limits the utility of the host computer. Further this type of system has the limitation that it cannot be used for acquiring other bio-medical signals, such as EEG (Electro EncepheloGram) EMG (ElectroMyoGram).<br>
In   the   second   type   of     stress   test   system,   the   host computerised  any     IBM  compatible   PC     and   the   amplifier,   filter, A/D     converter   are   dedicated   components.      A     Co-processor/ digital   signal   processor   is   also  used   to  process      (acquire, display,   store,   document)   ECG   signal   for   stress   test.      In this     type  of   system,   host  computer   is   available     for  any other  application.     The  cost  of   these   system,   as   compared   to first-type   of   system  described   in   preceding   para,   is   also relatively   lower.   However,   these   type   of   systems   like the   first   type   of   systems   have   also   the   limitation   that     these can   not   be   ased   for   acquiring   other   bio-medical   signals such   as   EEG,   EMG.<br>
The   primary   object  of   the   present   invention   is   to  propose an   improved   low-cost  automatic      stress     device   to   obviate the   above     disadvantages.<br>
Another   object   of   the   present      invention   is   to   provide a   stress   test  device,   which   can   simultaneously   acquire,   display, store   and  document   the     ECG,   without   use   of   fast  DSP   (digital signal   processor)   or  without  use   of   a   co-processor.<br>
Yet  another   object  of   the   present   invention   is     to provide   a   stress   test  which   can   be   used   as   a   general   purpose data   acquisition   system  with   on-line   display,   for   acquiring EEG,   EMG     and   speach   signals   with   little   or   no-modifications.<br>
Still   another   object     of   the   present   invention   is   to provide   a   stress   test  device   in  which     host   computer   besides stress   test  analysis,   is   available   for   other   applications, thereby   enhancing   the   utility   of   the   host   computer.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an automatic stress test device capable to be used for the diagnosis of the disease like arrhythmia, with addition of co-processor boards which can access data-lines already provided in the system.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide the stress test device provided with DC-DC conveter which draws the power from PC power supply and supplies isolated and regulated power to all circuits of the stress test system.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an automatic device for use in a stress test system comprising a 12 channel amplifier adapted to be connected to the resistance network and with a 12 channel voltage to current converter connected to the outputs of the channel amplifier, a 12 channel band pass filter having a current to voltage conveter connected to the outputs of said amplifier, a multiplexer connected to the outputs of said filter being provided to digitize the signal received from said 12 channels simultaneously, an analog to digital converter adapted to be connected to the PC bus being connected to said multiplexer.<br>
In   accordance     with   this   invention   the   amplifier consists   of     12   amplifier  circuits   to  amplify   the    12   Lead/ signals     received   from  the  network  of   the   ECG... .     A     volt    to current  converter   is   connected   to   the   output  of   the<br>
amplifier   to   convert   the   signals.      A     band  pass      filter having   a   current to Voltage   converter   connected   the   inputs<br>
thereof      is   connected   to   said   amplifier   to   remove   the<br>
base   line     drift  and     muscle   noise.      A  multiplexer   having<br>
a   timing   and   control   circuit   connected   therewith,   is connected to the   band   pass   filter   generate   timing   and   channel<br>
selection   signals.      An  opto   isolator   is   connected   to   the<br>
output     of   said  multiflexer   so   as   to   isolate   the   patient<br>
from   the   PC     and   its   power   supply   so  as   to  provide<br>
safety   to  the  patient  against     leakage  of  cutrent.     An<br>
analoge   to  digital   converter   is   connected   to  the  output<br>
of     the   isolator   for  digitising   the   signals     to  be<br>
transfered   to   the   PC-Bus   by  DMA   (Direct  Memory  Assess)<br>
controller  circuit  of   the     PC,     A  DC-DC  converter   is<br>
provided  to  draw  the  power      from PC  power   supply   so  as<br>
to   supply   isolated,   regulated  power   supply   to   all   the<br>
analog   circuits.      Further   another   DC-DC   converter   is<br>
provided     so  as   to  convert  PC     power   supply   into  isolated<br>
and   regulated     supply   to   supply   the   same   to   12   channel<br>
amplifier     and  voltage   to  current     convertor.<br>
The     ECG  signal   contains     noise   from  sources   such as  muscle   noise,   RF   signals   and  AC     supply.      The     signal rides   on  a   base   line  drift  due   to   improper   contact.   The subject   is   moving   in   this     system  and   hence   the   signal is   prone   to  motion   artifacts.      Therefore   the   ECG   data are  acquired  in   twelve  channels,   and  acquisition   is   simultaneous. The       frequencies   of   interest  are   of   0.05Hz   to   100   Hz.   The voltage   is   of   the   order   of   a   few  mV   and   hence   sufficient amplification   is     done.     The  parameters   to  be  monitored are     ST     shift  and  heart  rate.      These   parameters   are   computed continuously   and   therefore,   the     processor   time     is used  optimally.     Further,   the  display   is   on  a  graph  and to  scale.<br>
An  automatic   stress   test  system  according   to  a preferred  embodiment     is   herein  described  and   illustrated in   the   accompanying  drawings  where-in:<br>
Fig     1:	shows   the     schematic     of   the   stress   test<br>
device.<br>
Fig     2:	shows   the  points   on   the  body  where   electrodes<br>
are   fixed.<br>
Fig.   3:	shows   the   block   diagram  and   flow  chart  of   the<br>
device. Referring   to     the     drawings   particularly     Fig.2, electrodes   are  connected   to  positions     RA,LA,   RL,   LL,   VI, to  V6   on     the   body   of   the     patient.      The   voltage   are   picked<br>
up   using     clips     and   cables   connected   to  resistance network     1   to  derive   the     12   channels   of   the     amplifier 2   of   the   ECG.      Signals   are   amplified   by     12   channel amplifier   2.     These  signals     are  converted   into  current by  voltage   to  current  converter   3   connected   to  said  amplifier 2.      The     resistance     network     1,   12   channel   amplifier   2   and converter   3   are  housed   in   a   single   portable   box   4.      A current   to  voltage   converter     7   is   connected   to   the   output of   said   converter     3   and   the   current   signal   flows   through current  to  voltage  converter  7.     The  voltage   is   then  passed through     12   channel   Band  Pass  Filter  8   connected  to     the converter     7   and  provided   to   remove   the   base   line   drift and  muscle  noise   (0.05   to  100   Hz).     Timing  and  control circuit     9     is  connected  to   the     multiplexer   10     to generates     timing  and   channel   selection   signals   which are   input  to  the  multiplexer     10.     The     multiplexer selects  one  channel,   at  a   time  at  the  rate  of   240 samples/sec/channel   and     transmit  the   selected  channel to  the  opto-isolator  11   connected  therewith.        The opto-isolator     11   isolates   patients   from  the   PC   and   its power   supply.      This   is   done   to   ensure   the   safety   of   Patient against   leakage   of   current.      An   analog        to  digital   converter 12   is   connected   to   the  out-put     of   the     isolater   11   to digitise   the   signals   and   the  data   is  made  available   fortransfer  to  PC-RAM     at  the  PC-BUS   6.     The  data   is<br>
transferred  to     PC-RAM     by  DMA   (Direct  Memory  Access)<br>
controller     circuit   (not  shown)      of   the     PC.      A<br>
DC-DC     converter   13   is   connected   to   the  PC  power   supply<br>
so  as   to     draw  power   from     PC   power   supply   and   to   supply<br>
isolated,   regualted  power   supply   to  all   the   components<br>
9-12   as  mention  herein  above.     The  components     9-13   are<br>
housed     in   a   housing     5   which     is   disposed     inside   the<br>
DC	Bus   6.      Another     DC-DC   converter   14   is   provided<br>
with   the   PC     so  as   to   convert     PC     power   supply   into isolated  and  regulated     supply   and   supplies   the   power   to resistance  network     1,   amplifire     2   and  converter   3.<br>
The amplification factors have been carefully selected to give the best signal to noise ratio. DC-DC converter noise and PC-SMPS (Switched Mode Power Supply) noise have been completely isolated from the signal. The stress test system is driven by the following software package consisting of following modules.<br>
(a)      data   acquisition   software   (using   DMA   technique) for   DMA     controller   of   PC  which   is   programmed   to   transfer data   in   to   PC-RAM     without  hampering   the  working   of   PC. Due     to  this     software  only   2%   of   the  PC  CPU   time     is used   for  data   transfer.<br>
 (b)	display   software   to  display   any   selected   4<br>
