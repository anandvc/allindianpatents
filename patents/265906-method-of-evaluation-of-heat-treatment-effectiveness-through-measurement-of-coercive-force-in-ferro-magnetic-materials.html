				<td>TITLE: A METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF POST<br>
WELD STRESS RELIEVING HEAT TREATMENT IN FERROMAGNETIC<br>
MATERIALS THROUGH MEASUREMENT OF COERCIVE FORCE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a Non destructive examination method for<br>
evaluating the effectiveness of Post weld stress relieving Heat treatments of Pipe<br>
joint welds say at Boiler erection sites in general and to a method for<br>
determination of effectiveness of post weld stress relieving heat treatment in<br>
ferromagnetic material through measurement of coercive force in particular. This<br>
method is based on the difference in measurements of coercive force before and<br>
after Post weld stress relieving heat treatment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Stress relieving Heat treatment is a very important process employed to improve<br>
the mechanical properties of Heat Affected Zone &amp; weld and to relieve the<br>
residual stresses in parts fabricated / erected by welding. This process is carried<br>
out by using either an oil/gas fired or electrical furnace in production shops<br>
where the entire weldment is kept under uniform temperature condition<br>
throughout the heat treatment operation.<br>
However at erection sites, local post weld heat treatment is often applied by<br>
wrapping heating coils around the circumference of weld joints covering the weld<br>
and certain region close to the weld joint. In this context the effectiveness of<br>
heat treatment becomes a matter of interest, especially in temper sensitive<br>
materials.<br><br>
At present there are many methods for determining the effectiveness of Heat<br>
treatment such as Hardness measurements and Microstructure evaluation in<br>
weld and HAZ (Heat Affected Zone) of weld joints. In addition residual stress<br>
measurements using X ray diffraction method or Hole drilling strain gage method<br>
are also carried out as a laboratory tool, to establish the Heat treatment<br>
procedure. Hardness measurements require surface preparation; Microstructure<br>
evaluation can be done only in labs. X ray diffraction method requires more<br>
space and heavier equipments not much suitable for erection sites. Hole drilling<br>
strain gauge method is a destructive method, requiring drilling equipment,<br>
surface preparation and time consuming.<br>
A new non-destructive evaluation method, using measurement of magnetic<br>
coercive force values, before and after Post weld stress relieving is illustrated in<br>
this presentation. This non-destructive testing method is based on the change in<br>
coercive force values due to changes in submicroscopic imperfections in the<br>
material. As high temperature heat treatment process brings about changes in<br>
the micro and submicroscopic level*; due to creep and plastic deformation, the<br>
application of the coercive force to evaluate the change in structure becomes a<br>
possibility.<br>
Patent no.: JP2001252785 (A) provides a device and a method for non<br>
destruction evaluation about the adequacy of a heat treatment after welding,<br>
which is applied for a ferromagnetic weldment. This method uses an AC<br>
magnetizing waveform. By detecting a phase difference between an exciting<br>
waveform and a detected waveform, the heat treatment is evaluated. This is a<br>
complicated method and evaluation is difficult,<br><br>
Patent no.: JP59155743 (A) describes a method for measuring hardness of heat-<br>
treated steel by x-ray diffraction using gaussian curve. This method involves X<br>
ray source and is not suitable for erection sites.<br>
Patent no.: US4129033 (A) describes a System for determining the level of heat<br>
treatment. This method employs strain gauges for determining the heat<br>
treatment level. This method is applicable only to a particular product process<br>
line.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a non-destructive method for<br>
evaluating the effectiveness of Post weld stress relieving Heat treatment of<br>
welded parts at erection sites<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a method using standard portable<br>
coercive force measuring equipment for evaluating the effectiveness of Post weld<br>
stress relieving Heat treatment of welded parts at erection sites<br>
A further object of the invention is that no surface preparation is required for<br>
taking coercive force measurements for evaluating the effectiveness of Post weld<br>
stress relieving Heat treatment of welded parts at erection sites<br>
A further object of the invention is to devise a simple and reliable method for<br>
evaluating the effectiveness of Post weld stress relieving Heat treatment of<br>
welded parts at erection sites<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A standard portable Coercimeter [Magnetic structurescope) is used for the<br>
proposed method. The coercive force measurements are taken before and after<br>
the Post weld stress relieving Heat treatment around the pipe circumference in<br>
weld &amp; HAZ. The substantial changes in the readings show the effectiveness of<br>
the Post weld stress relieving Heat treatment process.<br>
By conducting laboratory experiments for stress relieving heat treatment, the<br>
coercive values before and after stress relieving can be recorded for welds of<br>
different material combinations as per requirement. The coercive values obtained<br>
at actual jobs can be compared with standard values, to evaluate the<br>
effectiveness of Heat treatment<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>

Fig2 - Equipment and Job setup<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The invention will now be described with help of accompanying drawings which<br>
depict an exemplary embodiments of the invention. However there can be<br>
several other embodiments, all of which are deemed covered by the description<br><br>
Coercive force (or Coercivity) is a magnetic characteristic, which may be<br>
measured for any ferromagnetic material. The most common representation of<br>
magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic material is its hysteresis loop. H<br>
(magnetizing force) B (Flux density) are the coordinates. On a hysteresis loop,<br>
the Coercivity (He) is the loop width on H axes. To understand the term coercive<br>
force, hysteresis loop is of great help. Measuring the magnetic flux of a<br>
ferromagnetic material while the magnetizing force is changed generates a<br>
hysteresis loop. A ferromagnetic material, which has not been magnetized<br>
previously or not gone through complete demagnetization, will follow a dashed<br>
line as in the Fig 1, as the magnetizing force is increased. Higher the applied<br>
current for magnetizing force (H), higher is the magnetic field (B). Beyond the<br>
Saturation point , however the magnetizing force is increased, there will be a<br>
little increase in the magnetic flux. This point: is called as the magnetic saturation<br>
point. When the magnetizing force (H) is made zero, still there exists some<br>
magnetism in the material. This is called as the point of retention (Residual<br>
Magnetism). This gives a measure of the residual magnetism present in the<br>
material. Coercive force is the magnetizing force required to be applied in the<br>
opposite direction to bring the residual magnetism to zero value.<br>
The coercive force value He measured in (A/cm) Ampere per centimeter is very<br>
sensitive to microscopic structural changes in the material. Hence by measuring<br>
this value with a portable equipment we can evaluate the effectiveness of Post<br>
weld stress relieving Heat treatment at erection sites also.<br>
This method as shown in Fig 2 uses a portable battery operated standard<br>
Coercive force-measuring meter (1). By magnetizing and demagnetizing the<br><br>
material (2), it measures the coercive force in the material. The reduction in the<br>
coercive force value indicates the Post weld stress relieving Heat treatment<br>
effectiveness. We can compare the coercive force values with already recorded<br>
standard values for various stress relieving parameters taken during lab tests for<br>
the same material and conditions of the stress relieving process.<br>
This coercive force value is different for different materials. This value is very<br>
sensitive to submicroscopic changes in the atomic structure of the materials.<br>
Hence stress relieving heat treatment of welded components effects a 50%<br>
change in the value before and after the heat treatment. These values when<br>
compared with standard values already measured in lab and recorded for the<br>
same material under the predefined process conditions, results in the evaluation<br>
of the effectiveness of Post weld stress relieving Heat treatment.<br>
The method can be applied to ferrc(magnetic materials even with 2mm coating<br>
on its surface. The method for determination of effectiveness of Post weld stress<br>
relieving heat treatment in ferromagnetic materials through measurement of<br>
coercive force comprises of a number of steps described herein. The area of the<br>
job selected by the probe is magnetized. The selected area is then demagnetized<br>
and the coercive force is measured. The measured values are then compared<br>
with standard coercive force values for that material recorded in the laboratory<br>
for the given stress relieving heat treatment parameters. The effectiveness of<br>
Post weld stress relieving heat treatment is then determined or evaluated. The<br>
determination or evaluation of said effectiveness is done through coercive force<br>
measurement in a non destructive way and with portable equipment<br><br>
