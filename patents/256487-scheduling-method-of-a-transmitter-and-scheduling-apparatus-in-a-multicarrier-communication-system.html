Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a scheduling apparatus and<br>
method for a communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and<br>
method for performing scheduling using channel quality information (CQI) for<br>
only particular carriers in a communication system using multiple carriers<br>
(multicarrier communication system).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Extensive research is being conducted on a 4th generation (4G)<br>
communication system which is the next generation communication system to<br>
provide users with services having various Qualities of Service (QoSs) supporting<br>
a high data rate. In particular, extensive research is being conducted on the 4G<br>
communication system to support a high-speed service guaranteeing mobility<br>
and a QoS in a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system such<br>
as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and a wireless Metropolitan Area<br>
Network (MAN) system.<br>
In order to provide a high-speed, high-quality wireless multimedia<br>
service, the 4G communication system requires broadband spectrum resources.<br>
However, the use of the broadband spectrum resources increases a fading effect<br><br>
in a wireless transmission path due to multipath propagation, and causes a<br>
frequency selective fading effect even in a transmission band. Therefore, for the<br>
high-speed wireless multimedia service, an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme which is robust against frequency selective fading is<br>
popularly used in the 4G communication systems.<br>
The OFDM scheme, a scheme for transmitting data using multiple<br>
carriers, is a kind of a Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) scheme that prior to<br>
transmission parallel-converts a serial input symbol stream into parallel symbols<br>
and modulates the parallel symbols with a plurality of orthogonal subcarriers.<br>
The OFDM scheme has the advantage of being capable of maximizing<br>
throughput using a link adaptation scheme in addition to being robust against<br>
the frequency selective fading.<br><br>
A multiple access scheme based on the OFDM scheme is referred to as an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme. The<br>
OFDMA scheme reorders particular subcarriers among all of subcarriers into a<br>
subchannel and allocates the subchannel to a particular subscriber station (SS).<br>
The "subchannel" refers to a channel comprised of at least one subcarrier. The use<br>
of the OFDMA scheme enables a dynamic resource allocation in which a<br>
subchannel can be dynamically allocated to a particular SS based on a fading<br>
characteristic of a wireless channel, and in the OFDMA scheme, an increase in<br>
number of SSs, i.e. an increase in number of users, increases a 'multiuser<br>
diversity gain'. Therefore, extensive studies of the OFDMA scheme is being<br>
conducted in the 4G communication system that requires relatively high<br>
throughput.<br>
In all of the communication systems in which a multiuser environment is<br>
implemented, it is necessary to efficiently allocate resources to each user, i.e. SS,<br>
and a communication system using the OFDMA scheme (OFDMA<br>
communication system) should also efficiently allocate resources. For<br>
convenience, a description of a communication system supporting the multiuser<br>
environment (multiuser environment communication system) will be made herein<br>
with reference to the OFDMA communication system. A description will now be<br>
made of scheduling schemes proposed for the efficient allocation of resources in<br>
the multiuser environment communication system.<br>
The scheduling scheme refers to a scheme for allocating resources to each<br>
SS, and the typical scheduling schemes include a Maximum Carrier-to-<br>
interference ratio (Max C/I) scheme, a Maximum Fairness (MF) scheme, and a<br>
Proportional Fairness (PF) scheme. A description will now be made of the Max<br>
C/I scheme, the MF scheme, and the PF scheme.<br>
(1) Max C/I Scheme<br>
The Max C/I scheme is a scheduling scheme for allocating particular<br>
subcarriers to an SS having the best channel state from among a plurality of SSs<br>
in the multiuser environment communication system, i.e. the OFDMA<br>
communication system, and the use of the Max C/I scheme maximizes a<br>
multiuser diversity gain, thereby maximizing the entire throughput of the<br>
OFDMA communication system. Each of the SSs reports a state of a channel to<br>
its associated base station (BS), i.e. channel quality, for example, CQI<br>
representing a C/I, back to the BS, and the BS regards, as an SS having the best<br>
channel state, an SS that has fed back a CQI representing the maximum C/I<br><br>
among CQIs fed back from the SSs.<br>
In the Max C/I scheme, if C/Is for all of the subcarriers have small values<br>
because of a very poor channel state of a particular SS, the particular SS cannot<br>
be allocated any subcarrier on a certain occasion. That is, because the Max C/I<br>
scheme allocates corresponding subcarriers to an SS having the best channel state<br>
for all of the subcarriers used in the OFDMA communication system, an SS<br>
having a very poor channel state may fail to be allocated even one subcarrier on a<br>
certain occasion.<br>
The Max C/I scheme allocates subcarriers based only on a channel state<br>
between a BS and an SS, thus making it impossible to guarantee fairness between<br>
SSs. However, the Max C/I scheme which is easily implemented is superior to the<br>
other scheduling schemes in terms of complexity.<br>
Due to the foregoing characteristics, the Max C/I scheme is chiefly used<br>
for the maximization of the entire throughput of the OFDMA communication<br>
system even though fairness between SSs is not guaranteed. However, the Max<br>
C/I scheme's advantage of maximizing the entire throughput of the OFDMA<br>
communication system is acquired only when each of the SSs can feed back CQIs<br>
for all subcarriers. That is, when each of the SSs feeds back CQIs for only<br>
particular subcarriers instead of all of the subcarriers, the Max C/I scheme's<br>
advantage of maximizing the entire throughput of the OFDMA communication<br>
system is not guaranteed. The reason for considering the case in which the SS<br>
feeds back CQIs for only particular subcarriers instead of all subcarriers in the<br>
OFDMA communication system is because the CQI feedback for all of the<br>
subcarriers causes an uplink load and functions as uplink interference to other SSs.<br>
Therefore, there is extensive research being conducted on feeding back CQIs for<br>
only particular subcarriers instead of all the subcarriers.<br>
(2) MF Scheme<br>
The MF scheme is a scheduling scheme proposed to maximize the<br>
throughput of an SS allocated the minimum throughput among throughputs of a<br>
plurality of SSs. Compared with the Max C/I scheme, the MF scheme can<br>
guarantee some lever of fairness between the SSs. Although the MF scheme<br>
actually maximizes the fairness between the SSs as compared with the Max C/I<br>
scheme, the entire throughput of the OFDMA communication system is<br>
undesirably reduced due to the fairness between the SSs.<br><br>
Generally, the MF scheme compulsorily allocates a subcarrier for an SS<br>
having a very poor channel state, if any. Therefore, compared with allocation of<br>
the subcarrier to an SS having the best channel state, i.e. the maximum C/I, the<br>
allocation of the subcarrier to the SS having a very poor channel state causes a<br>
decrease in throughput, thereby reducing the entire throughput of the OFDMA<br>
communication system.<br>
Due to the foregoing characteristics, the use of the MF scheme is not<br>
taken into consideration in a wireless communication system like the OFDMA<br>
communication system. Instead, the use of the MF scheme is chiefly used in a<br>
wire communication system in which a bottleneck link due to setup of many links<br>
between a source and a destination may fatally affect the entire performance of<br>
the communication system. In addition, the MF scheme is significantly higher<br>
than the Max C/I scheme in terms of implementation complexity. Actually, the<br>
use of the MF scheme is scarcely taken into consideration in the OFDMA<br>
communication system.<br>
The MF scheme's advantage of maximizing fairness between SSs is<br>
acquired only when each of the SSs feeds back CQIs for all of the subcarriers.<br>
That is, when each of the SSs feeds back CQIs for only particular subcarriers<br>
instead of all of the subcarriers, the MF scheme's advantage of maximizing<br>
fairness between SSs is not guaranteed.<br>
(3) PF Scheme<br>
The PF scheme, a combined scheme of the Max C/I scheme and the MF<br>
scheme, is a scheduling scheme for maximizing the entire throughput while<br>
guaranteeing fairness between SSs. The PF scheme maximizes the entire<br>
throughput while guaranteeing some level of fairness between SSs, and exhibits<br>
superior performance. Therefore, the PF scheme is popularly used in the OFDMA<br>
communication system. In addition, the PF scheme can be implemented at lower<br>
complexity in a communication system using a single carrier (single-carrier<br>
communication system).<br>
However, when used in multicarrier communication systems such as the<br>
OFDM communication system and the OFDMA communication system, the PF<br>
scheme increases in terms of complexity, and there is no proposed solution for the<br>
increase in complexity. The PF scheme's advantage of maximizing the entire<br>
throughput while guaranteeing fairness between SSs is acquired only when each<br>
of the SSs feeds back CQIs for all of the subcarriers. That is, when each of the<br><br><br>
SSs feeds back CQIs for only particular subcarriers instead of all of the<br>
subcarriers, the PF scheme's advantage of maximizing the entire throughput<br>
while guaranteeing fairness between the SSs is not guaranteed.<br>
As described above, the Max C/I scheme, the MF scheme and the PF<br>
scheme are scheduling schemes proposed on the assumption that each of the<br>
SSs feeds back CQIs for all of the subcarriers. Therefore, the advantages of the<br>
Max C/I scheme, the MF scheme and the PF scheme cannot be guaranteed when<br>
the SSs feed back CQIs for only particular subcarriers instead of all of the<br>
subcarriers in the OFDMA communication system.<br>
WO 03/058871(Dl) refers to resource allocation for MIMO-OFDM communication<br>
system. The D1 recites "Techniques to schedule terminals for data transmission<br>
on the downlink and/or uplink in a MIMO-OFDM system based on the spatial<br>
and/or frequency "signatures" of the terminals. A scheduler forms one or more<br>
sets of terminals for possible (downlink or uplink) data transmission for each of a<br>
number of frequency bands. One or more sub-hypotheses may further be formed<br>
for each hypothesis, with each sub-hypothesis corresponding to (1) specific<br>
assignments of transmit antennas to the terminal(s) in the hypothesis (for the<br>
downlink) or (2) a specific order for processing the uplink data transmissions<br>
from the terminal(s) (for the uplink). The performance of each sub-hypothesis is<br><br><br>
then evaluated (e.g., based on one or more performance metrics). One sub-<br>
hypothesis is then selected for each frequency band based on the evaluated<br>
performance, and the one or more terminals in each selected sub-hypothesis are<br>
then scheduled for data transmission on the corresponding frequency band".<br>
Han et al describes an OFDMA/FDD system in the non-patent literature published<br>
by IEEE in September 2004, page 511-514, the article entitled "Opportunistic<br>
scheduling with partial channel information in OFDMA/FDD systems".<br>
However, in the OFDMA communication system in which the SSs feed<br>
back CQIs for only particular subcarriers, when both complexity and performance<br>
are taken into consideration, the Max C/I scheme is superior to the MF scheme<br>
and the PF scheme. For the Max C/I scheme, it has been proven that a decrease<br>
in CQI feedback quantity causes a decrease in the entire throughput. However,<br>
how the decrease in CQI feedback quantity will affect the fairness between SSs<br>
has never been taken into consideration. The "CQI feedback quantity" refers to<br>
the number of subcarriers, CQIs for which are fed back. Therefore, there is a<br>
demand for a new scheduling scheme capable of maintaining fairness between<br>
SSs, maximizing throughput and guaranteeing minimum complexity in the<br>
OFDMA communication system.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a scheduling<br>
apparatus and method for guaranteeing a level of fairness between subscriber<br>
stations (SSs) in a multicarrier communication system.<br>
It is further another object of the presept invention to provide a<br>
scheduling apparatus and method for maximizing throughput in a multicarrier<br>
communication system.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a scheduling<br>
apparatus and method for varying CQI feedback quantity in a multicarrier<br>
communication system.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention proposes an apparatus and method for scheduling<br>
using channel quality information (CQI) for only particular carriers in a<br>
communication system using multiple carriers (multicarrier communication<br><br>
system). In particular, the present invention proposes a scheduling apparatus and<br>
method for maximizing throughput and guaranteeing a level of fairness between<br>
subscriber stations (SSs) by performing scheduling based on a Maximum Carrier-<br>
to-interference ratio (Max C/I) scheme using CQIs for the particular carriers. For<br>
the sake of convenience, a description of the multicarrier communication system<br>
will be made herein with reference to a communication system using an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme which is a<br>
multiple access scheme based on an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme (OFDMA communication system).<br>
The scheduling scheme proposed by the present invention is based on the<br>
Max C/I scheme which is a scheduling scheme that reduces the complexity of the<br>
scheduling scheme in the OFDMA communication system, guarantees a level of<br>
fairness between SSs, and controls the SSs to feed back CQIs for only particular<br>
subcarriers instead of all of the subcarriers while taking into consideration uplink<br>
load and uplink interference caused by CQI feedback in the OFDMA<br>
communication system. The operation of feeding back CQIs for only particular<br>
subcarriers instead of all of the subcarriers in the OFDMA communication system<br>
will be referred to as a "partial CQI feedback operation," and the CQIs for the<br>
particular subcarriers will be referred to as a "partial CQI." The scheduling<br>
scheme proposed by the present invention, i.e. the scheme for performing<br>
scheduling based on the Max C/I scheme using the partial CQI, will be referred to<br>
as an "adaptive scheduling scheme."<br>
The adaptive scheduling scheme proposed by the present invention<br>
exhibits the can following 3 qualities.<br>
(1)	Minimization of CQI Feedback Quantity<br>
The minimization of the CQI feedback quantity functions as a very<br>
important factor in the performance improvement of a multicarrier<br>
communication system like the OFDMA communication system, because the CQI<br>
feedback functions as an uplink load and an uplink interference as described<br>
above. Herein, the "CQI feedback quantity" refers to the number of subcarriers,<br>
for which CQIs are fed back.<br>
(2)	Minimization of Scheduling Complexity<br>
The minimization of the scheduling complexity also functions as a very<br>
important factor in the performance improvement of a multicarrier<br>
communication system like the OFDMA communication system, because the<br><br>
minimization of scheduling complexity reduces the cost of the devices. The<br>
reason for reducing the cost of devices is because the minimization of scheduling<br>
complexity can minimize power consumption and decrease the number of<br>
component blocks constituting the multicarrier communication system, making it<br>
possible to produce the devices at lower prices.<br>
In particular, when using a Maximum Fairness (MF) scheme and a<br>
Proportional Fairness (PF) scheme chiefly used in a conventional communication<br>
system using a single carrier (single-carrier communication system), the<br>
multicarrier communication system increases in complexity. Therefore, it is<br>
difficult for the multicarrier communication system to use the MF scheme and the<br>
PF scheme.<br>
(3) Maximization of Throughput and Fairness<br>
In an actual wireless communication system, it is not possible to exclude<br>
a fairness problem between the SSs in order to maximize the entire throughput of<br>
the wireless communication system, and also, it is not possible to exclude a<br>
throughput problem in order to maximize fairness between the SSs. That is, a<br>
scheduling scheme considering both the throughput and the fairness is an<br>
optimum scheduling scheme, and the adaptive scheduling scheme proposed by<br>
the present invention guarantees the throughput by performing a scheduling<br>
operation based on the Max C/I scheme, and guarantees the fairness by feeding<br>
back CQIs for only particular subcarriers. The scheme for feeding back CQIs for<br>
only particular subcarriers, i.e. a partial CQI feedback scheme, will be described<br>
in detail later.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, a description will now be made of a transmitter<br>
structure for an OFDMA communication system according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The transmitter of the OFDMA communication system will<br>
be described with reference to a base station (BS), and the receiver of the<br>
OFDMA communication system will be described with reference to an SS.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter structure for an<br>
OFDMA communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a transmitter, i.e. a BS, for the OFDMA<br>
communication system includes a first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111, a<br>
second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113, a selector 115, an adaptive<br>
scheduler 117, an adaptive modulator 119, a selector 121, an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transformer (IFFT) 123, a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 125, a digital-to-<br>
analog (D/A) converter 127, and a radio frequency (RF) processor 129.<br><br>
User data for a plurality of, for example, K SSs of a first SS SS#1 to a<br>
K SS SS#K to which the BS is providing a service, is input to the adaptive<br>
scheduler 117. A description will now be made of an operation of the adaptive<br>
scheduler 117.<br>
The adaptive scheduler 117 performs a scheduling operation based on the<br>
Max C/I scheme. A conventional scheduler using the Max C/I scheme (Max C/I<br>
scheduler) allocates subcarriers such that each SS can feed back CQIs for all of<br>
the subcarriers (full CQI) and a BS can maximize throughput for each subcarrier<br>
by taking into consideration the full CQI fed back by the SS. The Max C/I<br>
scheduler selects an SS having the best channel state, i.e. the maximum C/I, for<br>
each subcarrier, and allocates a corresponding subcarrier to the selected SS.<br>
However, the adaptive scheduler 117, unlike the conventional Max C/I<br>
scheduler, receives a partial CQI fed back from each SS, instead of a full CQI.<br>
Therefore, even though the adaptive scheduler 117 performs a scheduling<br>
operation based on the Max C/I scheme, it performs the scheduling operation in a<br>
different way from that of the conventional Max C/I scheduler.<br>
(1)	Rule 1: Contention-Based Scheduling Scheme Based on Partial CQI<br>
Feedback<br>
The adaptive scheduler 117 performs a scheduling operation based on the<br>
partial CQI feedback. In the partial CQI feedback, all of the SSs feed back CQIs<br>
for the particular subcarriers instead of all of the subcarriers. For specific<br>
subcarriers, there exist CQIs fed back by particular SSs instead of all of the SSs.<br>
For the specific subcarriers, because there are CQIs fed back by only particular<br>
SSs as described above, the SSs that have fed back CQIs for the specific<br>
subcarriers are allocated the specific subcarriers on a needs basis.<br>
In order for the adaptive scheduler 117 to perform a contention-based<br>
scheduling operation based on the partial CQI feedback, it is necessary to<br>
determine which SS from among all of the SSs should feed back CQIs and for<br>
how many subcarriers, and this depends upon the CQI feedback quantity decision<br>
operations of the first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 and the second CQI<br>
feedback quantity determiner 113. The CQI feedback quantity decision operations<br>
of the first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 and the second CQI feedback<br>
quantity determiner 113 will be described in detail later.<br>
(2)	Rule 2: Scheduling Scheme Based on Non-CQI Feedback<br><br>
Because each SS performs a partial CQI feedback operation, for a<br>
specific subcarrier among the subcarriers for an OFDMA communication system,<br>
the adaptive scheduler 117 may fail to receive a CQI from any one of the SSs on a<br>
certain occasion. In this case, the adaptive scheduler 117 allocates the subcarrier,<br>
for which it has failed to receive a CQI from any SS, to a corresponding SS by the<br>
following two kinds of scheduling schemes.<br>
A first scheduling scheme is a round-robin scheduling scheme. The<br>
round-robin scheduling scheme simply sequentially allocates the subcarriers to all<br>
of the SSs in a service area of a BS without any decision on channel states.<br>
Because the round-robin scheduling scheme sequentially allocates the subcarriers<br>
without considering the channel states of SSs as described above, this scheduling<br>
scheme suffers a loss in terms of the entire throughput of the OFDMA<br>
communication system, but it can guarantee a level of fairness by uniformly<br>
allocating the subcarriers to all of the SSs.<br>
In this state, because the adaptive scheduler 117 has failed to receive a<br>
CQI from any one SS, the adaptive scheduler 117 performs a control operation<br>
such that the most robust modulation order among the modulation orders<br>
supported in the OFDMA communication system should be applied for a<br>
subcarrier allocated by the round-robin scheduling scheme taking into<br>
consideration an SS having the worst channel state.<br>
A second scheduling scheme is an MF scheme. The MF scheme allocates<br>
subcarriers to an SS having the minimum throughput at present timing point. The<br>
MF scheme improves fairness by allocating a subcarrier, for which the adaptive<br>
scheduler 117 has failed to receive a CQI from any SS, to an SS having the<br>
minimum throughput at present timing point. Of course, the scheduling scheme in<br>
which the adaptive scheduler 117 allocates a subcarrier, for which it has failed to<br>
receive a CQI from any SS, can include various scheduling schemes in addition to<br>
the round-robin scheduling scheme and the MF scheme. The round-robin<br>
scheduling scheme and the MF scheme are given herein, by way of example.<br>
After performing a scheduling operation on the first SS to the Kth SS in<br>
the foregoing manner, i.e. after allocating the subcarriers of the OFDMA<br>
communication system to the first SS to the Kth SS, the adaptive scheduler 117<br>
outputs user data for the first SS to the Kth SS to the adaptive modulator 119. The<br>
adaptive modulator 119 modulates the user data for the first SS to the Kth SS with<br>
a modulation scheme corresponding to CQIs fed back from first SS to the Kth SS,<br><br>
and outputs the modulated user data to the selector 121.<br>
The adaptive modulator 119 modulates the user data for the first SS to the<br>
using a low-order modulation scheme such as Binary Phase Shift Keying<br>
(BPSK) scheme if the CQIs fed back from the first SS to the Kth SS indicate a<br>
poor channel state. On the contrary, if the CQIs fed back from the first SS to the<br>
Kth SS indicate a good channel state, the adaptive modulator 119 modulates the<br>
user data for the first SS to the Kth SS using a high-order modulation scheme such<br>
as 16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) scheme.<br>
The first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 determines CQI feedback<br>
quantities by taking into consideration the channel states of the SSs, i.e.<br>
determines the CQI feedback quantities of the first SS to the Kth SS depending on<br>
the CQIs fed back from the first SS to the Kth SS, and then outputs the determined<br>
CQI feedback quantities of the first SS to the Kth SS to the selector 115. A CQI<br>
feedback quantity decision operation of the first CQI feedback quantity<br>
determiner 111 will be described in detail later.<br>
The second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113, unlike the first CQI<br>
feedback quantity determiner 111, determines the CQI feedback quantities of the<br><br>
first SS to the Kth SS without by taking into consideration the channel states of the<br>
SSs, and then outputs the determined CQI feedback quantities of the first SS to<br>
the Kth SS to the selector 115. A CQI feedback quantity decision operation of the<br>
second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 will be described in detail later.<br>
The selector 115 selects the CQI feedback quantities output from the first<br>
CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 and outputs the selected CQI feedback<br>
quantities to the selector 121, when the OFDMA communication system uses a<br>
scheme for determining the CQI feedback quantities of SSs by taking into<br>
consideration the channel states of the SSs. In contrast, when the OFDMA<br>
communication system uses a scheme for determining the CQI feedback<br>
quantities of the SSs without by taking into consideration the channel states of the<br>
SSs, the selector 115 selects the CQI feedback quantities output from the second<br>
CQI feedback quantity determiner 113, and outputs the selected CQI feedback<br>
quantities to the selector 121. The CQI feedback quantities for the SSs become a<br>
kind of control data.<br>
The CQI feedback quantities for the SSs can be converted into control<br>
signals with one of the following two schemes by taking into consideration the<br><br>
feedback quantity of each of the SSs.<br>
A first scheme converts CQI feedback quantities for respective SSs into<br>
different control signals for the respective SSs when the CQI feedback quantities<br>
for the respective SSs are significantly different from each other.<br>
A second scheme, when CQI feedback quantities of respective SSs in a<br>
specific SS group are not significantly different from each other, i.e. similar to<br>
each other, converts the CQI feedback quantities for the respective SSs belonging<br>
to the SS group into control signals, and then groups the generated control signals<br>
into a final control signal. The final control signal is multicast to the SSs in the SS<br>
group through a kind of a multicast channel.<br>
Of course, the selector 115 can use other schemes in addition to the<br>
foregoing 2 schemes, and because the control signal generation scheme is not<br>
directly related to the present invention, a description thereof will be omitted.<br>
The selector 121 outputs the signal from the selector 115 to the IFFT 123<br>
when a corresponding time interval is a time interval for transmitting control data<br>
(control data time interval), and outputs the signal from the adaptive modulator<br>
119 to the IFFT 123 when a corresponding time interval is a time interval for<br>
transmitting user data (user data time interval). The IFFT 123 performs N-point<br>
IFFT on the signal output from the selector 121, and outputs the resultant signal<br>
to the P/S converter 125. The "control data" includes not only the CQI feedback<br>
quantities but also information related to the subcarriers allocated to respective<br>
SSs by the BS, i.e. scheduling information, and information related to the<br>
modulation schemes applied to the respective SSs.<br>
The P/S converter 125 receives a Cyclic Prefix with a length L in addition<br>
to the signal output from the IFFT 123. The Cyclic Prefix is a guard interval<br>
signal, and is inserted to remove interference between an OFDM symbol<br>
transmitted at a previous OFDM symbol transmission time and an OFDM symbol<br>
transmitted at a current OFDM symbol transmission time in the OFDMA<br>
communication system. The guard interval signal is generated using one of a<br>
Cyclic Prefix scheme for copying a predetermined number of last samples of an<br>
OFDM symbol in a time domain and inserting the copied samples in a valid<br>
OFDM symbol, and a Cyclic Postfix scheme for copying a predetermined number<br>
of first samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain and inserting the copied<br>
samples in a valid OFDM symbol. It is assumed in FIG. 1 that the guard interval<br><br>
signal is generated using the Cyclic Prefix scheme, and the guard interval signal<br>
generated using the Cyclic Prefix scheme is denoted by a Cyclic Prefix.<br>
The P/S converter 125 serial-converts the signal output from the IFFT<br>
123 and the Cyclic Prefix, and outputs the resultant signal to the D/A converter<br>
127. The D/A converter 127 analog-converts the signal output from the P/S<br>
converter 125, and outputs the resultant signal to the RF processor 129. The RF<br>
process 129, includes a filter and a front-end unit, performs RF processing such<br>
that the signal output from the D/A converter 127 can be transmitted over the air,<br>
and transmits the RF-processed signal via an antenna.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, a description has been made of a transmitter<br>
structure for an OFDMA communication system according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Next, with reference to FIG. 2, a description will be made<br>
of a receiver structure for an OFDMA communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a receiver structure for an OFDMA<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a receiver, i.e. an SS, for the OFDMA communication system<br>
includes an RF processor 211, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 213, a serial-<br>
to-parallel (S/P) converter 215, a fast Fourier transformer (FFT) 217, a subcarrier<br>
selection and adaptive demodulation unit 219, a channel estimator 221, a first<br>
CQI generator 223, and a second CQI generator 225.<br>
A signal transmitted from a transmitter is received via an antenna of the<br>
SS. The transmitted signal experiences a multipath channel fading and includes a<br>
noise component incurred during its transmission. The signal received via the<br>
antenna is input to the RF processor 211, and the RF processor 211 down-<br>
converts the signal received via the antenna into an intermediate frequency (IF)<br>
band signal, and outputs the resultant signal to the A/D converter 213. The A/D<br>
converter 213 digital-converts the analog signal output from the RF processor 211<br>
and outputs the resultant signal to the S/P converter 215.<br>
The S/P converter 215 parallel-converts the signal output from the A/D<br>
converter 213 to remove a Cyclic Prefix of a length L, and outputs the resultant<br>
signal to the FFT 217. The FFT 217 performs N-point FFT on the signal output<br>
from the S/P converter 215, and outputs the resultant signal to the subcarrier<br>
selection and adaptive demodulation unit 219 and the channel estimator 221.<br><br>
The subcarrier selection and adaptive demodulation unit 219 selects the<br>
subcarriers allocated to the SS from the signal output from the FFT 217 according<br>
to scheduling information received from the BS, and then demodulates the<br>
selected subcarriers into user data for the SS using a demodulation scheme<br>
corresponding to the modulation scheme used in the BS. Although not separately<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, control data transmitted from the transmitter is received in a<br>
control data time interval, and the subcarrier selection and adaptive demodulation<br>
unit 219 operates according to scheduling information and modulation scheme<br>
information in the received control data.<br>
The channel estimator 221 performs channel estimation on the signal<br>
output from the FFT 217, and outputs a channel estimation value to the first CQI<br>
generator 223 and the second CQI generator 225. For example, the channel<br>
estimator 221 estimates a channel state for every subcarrier for the OFDMA<br>
communication system using a reference signal or data such as a pilot signal, and<br>
outputs the channel estimation value to the first CQI generator 223 and the second<br>
CQI generator 225. The "channel estimation value" refers to a C/I, by way of<br>
example.<br>
The first CQI generator 223 generates a partial CQI according to the<br>
channel estimation value for every subcarrier for the OFDMA communication<br>
system, output from the channel estimator 221, and a CQI feedback quantity<br>
received from the BS. A partial CQI generation operation of the first CQI<br>
generator 223 will be described in detail later.<br>
The second CQI generator 225 calculates an average of channel<br>
estimation values, i.e. C/Is, for all of the subcarriers for the OFDMA<br>
communication system, received from the channel estimator 221, and generates<br>
an average CQI using the average channel estimation value. For example, the<br>
second CQI generator 225 calculates the average channel estimation value by<br>
arithmetic-averaging or geometric-averaging the channel estimation values for all<br>
of the subcarriers for the OFDMA communication system. An average CQI<br>
generation operation of the second CQI generator 225 will be described in detail<br>
later.<br>
The SS, although not separately illustrated in FIG. 2, selects a partial CQI<br>
generated by the first CQI generator 223 if a CQI feedback scheme used in the<br>
OFDMA communication system is a partial CQI feedback scheme, and selects an<br>
average CQI generated by the second CQI generator 225 if the CQI feedback<br><br>
scheme is an average CQI feedback scheme, and then feeds back the selected CQI<br>
to the BS.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, a description has been made of a receiver<br>
structure for an OFDMA communication system according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Next, with reference to FIG. 3, a description will be made<br>
of an internal structure of the first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 of FIG.<br>
1.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the first CQI<br>
feedback quantity determiner 111 of FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 3, the first CQI<br>
feedback quantity determiner 111 includes K comparison value calculators of a<br>
first-SS (SS#1) comparison value calculator 311-1 to a Kth-SS (SS#K)<br>
comparison value calculator 311-K, and a CQI feedback quantity calculator 313.<br>
If an average CQI for a particular SS, e.g. a kth SS, among K SSs is expressed by<br>
αavg,k, the SS#1 comparison value calculator 311-1 to the SS#K comparison value<br>
calculator 311-K each calculate a comparison value ck in accordance with<br>
Equation (1). The reason why the SS#1 comparison value calculator 311-1 to the<br>
SS#K comparison value calculator 311-K each calculate a comparison value ck by<br>
taking into consideration the average CQI αavg,k, is because the first CQI feedback<br>
quantity determiner 111 determines the CQI feedback quantities by taking into<br>
consideration channel states of respective SSs.<br><br>
In Equation (1), ck denotes a comparison value for a kth SS,<br>
Ravg,k(T)denotes a quantity of data that a kth SS receives on average for a<br>
particular time interval T, and the time interval T is a variable set according to the<br>
situation of the OFDMA communication system. The average received data<br>
quantities for all of the SSs of a BS are initialized to '1' as shown in Equation (2).<br><br>
Because a BS cannot recognize average received data quantities for all of<br>
its SSs at initial communication, the BS equally initializes the average received<br>
data quantities for all of its SSs to '1' as shown in Equation (2).<br><br>
If the BS performs an actual communication after equally initializing the<br>
average received data quantities for all of the SSs to '1' as shown in Equation (2),<br>
the average received data quantities for all of the SSs are updated as shown in<br>
Equation (3).<br><br>
In Equation (3), Dk(T) denotes a quantity of data that a kth SS receives in<br>
a time interval T, and Tw denotes a time interval for which an average of<br>
quantities of data that the kth SS receives is calculated. The Tw indicating a time<br>
interval for which an average of the quantities of the data that the kth SS receives<br>
is calculated is generally set to a very long time interval.<br>
In Equation (1), the reason for calculating the comparison value ck for a<br>
kth SS in an inverse proportion to the average CQI αav,k for the kth SS and the<br>
quantity Ravg,k(T) of data that the k SS receives on average for a particular time<br>
interval T is to increase fairness between the SSs. That is, the BS assigns higher<br>
priorities to an SS having a poor channel state and an SS having a low average<br>
received data quantity in a scheduling operation, thereby increasing fairness<br>
between the SSs.<br>
Once the respective comparison values for the first SS to the Kth SS are<br>
calculated in the foregoing manner, the CQI feedback quantity calculator 313<br>
calculates a CQI feedback quantity for a kth SS in accordance with Equation (4).<br><br>
and N. N denotes the total number of subcarriers for the OFDMA communication<br>
system. A round ( ) function is a function of generating a corresponding value into<br>
an integer most approximating the corresponding value, and β denotes a weight to<br>
be applied to a full CQI feedback quantity for all of the SSs or an average<br><br><br>
With reference to FIG. 3, a description has been made of an internal<br>
structure of the first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 of FIG. 1. Next, with<br>
reference to FIG. 4, a description will be made of an internal structure of the<br>
second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 of FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the second<br>
CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 of FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 4, the second<br>
CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 includes K comparison value calculators<br>
of a first-SS (SS#1) comparison value calculator 411-1 to a Kth-SS (SS#K)<br>
comparison value calculator 411-K, and a CQI feedback quantity calculator 413.<br>
The second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 determines the CQI feedback<br>
quantities for the respective SSs without taking into consideration the channel<br><br>
states of the respective SSs. Compared with the first CQI feedback quantity<br>
determiner 111 that determines the CQI feedback quantities by taking into<br>
consideration the channel states, the second CQI feedback quantity determiner<br>
113 can minimize uplink load and uplink interference due to the CQI feedback<br>
from the respective SSs, thus being suitable for actual communication.<br>
A CQI feedback quantity decision operation of the second CQI feedback<br>
quantity determiner 113 is almost equal to the CQI feedback quantity decision<br>
operation of the first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111, except that the<br>
average CQIs αavg,k are not used for calculation of the comparison values ck. The<br>
reason why the second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 does not use the<br>
average CQIs αavg,k for calculation of the comparison values ck is because the<br>
second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 determines the CQI feedback<br>
quantities without taking into consideration the channel states of the respective<br>
SSs as described above. Each of the SS#1 comparison value calculator 411-1 to<br>
the SS#K comparison value calculator 411-K each calculates a comparison value<br>
ck in accordance with Equation (7).<br><br>
The CQI feedback quantity decision operation of the second CQI<br>
feedback quantity determiner 113 is equal to the CQI feedback quantity decision<br>
operation of the first CQI feedback quantity determiner 111, except that the SS#1<br>
comparison value calculator 411-1 to the SS#K comparison value calculator 411-<br>
K each calculate the comparison value ck without taking into consideration the<br>
average CQIs αavg,k as shown in Equation (7). Therefore, a description of the<br>
remaining CQI feedback quantity decision operation of the second CQI feedback<br>
quantity determiner 113 will be omitted.<br>
As a result, because the second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113<br>
can determine the CQI feedback quantities for the respective SSs without<br>
determining the channel states of the respective SSs as described with reference<br>
to FIG. 4, the SSs are not necessarily required to feed back CQIs indicating the<br>
channel states, contributing to minimization of uplink load and uplink<br>
interference due to the CQI feedback of the respective SSs.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, a description has been made of an internal<br><br>
structure of the second CQI feedback quantity determiner 113 of FIG. 1. Next,<br>
with reference to FIG. 5, a description will be made of an internal structure of the<br>
first CQI generator 223 of FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the first CQI<br>
generator 223 of FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 5, the first CQI generator 223 of FIG. 2<br>
includes an ordering unit 511 and a selector 513.<br>
It will be assumed that channel estimation values for respective<br>
subcarriers for a particular SS, e.g. a kth SS, output from the channel estimator<br>
221, i.e. CQIs for a first subcarrier to an Nth subcarrier, are defined as αk,1 to αkN,<br>
i.e. αk,1, ak,2, ..., αk,N-1 αk,N. The CQIs αk,1, ak,2, ..., αk,N-1, αk,N for the first<br>
subcarrier to the Nth subcarrier, output from the channel estimator 221, are input<br>
to the ordering unit 511.<br>
The ordering unit 511 orders the CQIs αk,1, αk,2, ..., αk,N-1, αk,N for the<br>
first subcarrier to the Nth subcarrier, output from the channel estimator 221, in<br>
size order, and outputs the result to the selector 513. It will be assumed in FIG. 5<br>
that a CQI αk,1 for the first subcarrier has the maximum size, a CQI αk,2 for the<br>
second subcarrier has the second maximum size, and in this way, a CQI αk,N for<br>
the N subcarrier has the minimum size (α,1≥k,2≥...≥αk,N-1≥αk,N≥).<br>
The selector 513 selects a predetermined number of the subcarriers, i.e. as<br>
many subcarriers as the number corresponding to Lk which is a CQI feedback<br>
quantity for a kth SS, among CQIs for a total of N subcarriers which were ordered<br>
by the ordering unit 511 in size order, and outputs only the selected Lk CQIs αk,1,<br>
αk,2, ...,α,L . The reason why the selected Lk CQIs are αk,1, αk,2, ...,αk,Lk is because<br>
it is assumed that a CQI for the first subcarrier has the maximum value, a CQI for<br>
the second subcarrier has the second maximum value, and in this way, a CQI for<br>
the Nth subcarrier has the minimum value as described above.<br>
The reason that the selector 513 selects Lk CQIs determined for the kth SS<br>
in size order is because the adaptive scheduler 117 is based on the Max C/I<br>
scheme. Because the adaptive scheduler 117 allocates subcarriers to the<br>
corresponding SSs using the Max C/I scheme, the adaptive scheduler 117 requires<br>
the CQIs for only the subcarriers having good channel states. In other words, for<br>
each subcarrier, because the adaptive scheduler 117 allocates the subcarrier to an<br>
SS having the best channel state based on the Max C/I scheme, the SS allocated<br>
the subcarrier has a good channel state, i.e. a larger CQI. Due to the foregoing<br><br>
scheduling characteristic of the adaptive scheduler 117, it is preferable not to<br>
transmit the CQIs for the subcarriers having poor channel states in terms of uplink<br>
load and uplink interference.<br>
With reference to FIG. 5, a description has been made of an internal<br>
structure of the first CQI generator 223 of FIG. 2. Next, with reference to FIG. 6, a<br>
description will be made of a scheduling and signal transmission operation of a<br>
transmitter, i.e. a BS, for the OFDMA communication system.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a scheduling and signal transmission<br>
operation of a transmitter for an OFDMA communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, in step 611, a<br>
transmitter, i.e. a BS, for the OFDMA communication system performs<br>
scheduling on each of the K SSs based on the Max C/I scheme using the partial<br>
CQIs fed back from the K SSs, and then proceeds to step 613. The operation of<br>
performing scheduling on each of the K SSs is an operation of the allocating<br>
subcarriers for transmitting the user data for each of the K SSs, and is equal to the<br>
scheduling operation described in connection with FIG. 1.<br>
In step 613, the BS checks if it will determine the CQI feedback<br>
quantities by taking into consideration the channel states. The BS determines the<br>
CQI feedback quantities by taking into consideration the channel states if the CQI<br>
feedback quantity decision scheme is set to a scheme for determining the CQI<br>
feedback quantities by taking into consideration the channel states in the OFDMA<br>
communication system, and determines the CQI feedback quantities without by<br>
taking into consideration the channel states if the CQI feedback quantity decision<br>
scheme is set to a scheme for determining the CQI feedback quantities without by<br>
taking into consideration the channel states in the OFDMA communication<br>
system.<br>
That is, the BS determines the CQI feedback quantities using the first<br>
CQI feedback quantity determiner 111 if the CQI feedback quantity decision<br>
scheme is set to the scheme for determining the CQI feedback quantities by<br>
taking into consideration the channel states in the OFDMA communication<br>
system, and determines CQI feedback quantities using the second CQI feedback<br>
quantity determiner 113 if the CQI feedback quantity decision scheme is set to the<br>
scheme for determining the CQI feedback quantities without by taking into<br>
consideration the channel states in the OFDMA communication system.<br><br>
If it is determined in step 613 that the BS will determine the CQI<br>
feedback quantities by taking into consideration the channel states, the BS<br>
determines the CQI feedback quantities for each of the K SSs by taking into<br>
consideration the channel states in step 615, and then proceeds to step 619.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 613 that the BS will determine the CQI<br>
feedback quantities without by taking into consideration the channel states, the<br>
BS determines the CQI feedback quantities for each of the K SSs without by<br>
taking into consideration the channel states in step 617, and then proceeds to step<br>
619.<br>
In step 619, the BS determines if a current time interval is a control data<br>
time interval. If it is determined that the current time interval is the control data<br>
time interval, the BS transmits in step 621 control data including the determined<br>
CQI feedback quantities, scheduling information and modulation scheme<br>
information.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 619 that the current time interval is<br>
not the control data time interval, i.e. the current time interval is a user data time<br>
interval, then the BS modulates user data for each of the K SSs using a<br>
modulation scheme corresponding to the partial CQIs for the K SSs in step 623.<br>
Thereafter, in step 625, the BS performs radio processing, i.e. IFFT operation, P/S<br>
conversion, D/A conversion and RF processing on the modulated user data for<br>
each of the K SSs, transmits the radio-processed signal, and then ends its<br>
operation.<br>
With reference to FIG. 6, a description has been made of a scheduling and<br>
signal transmission operation of a transmitter for an OFDMA communication<br>
system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Next, with reference<br>
to FIG. 7, a description will be made of a signal reception and CQI generation<br>
operation of a receiver for an OFDMA communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a signal reception and the CQI<br>
generation process of a receiver for an OFDMA communication system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, in step 711, a<br>
receiver, i.e. an SS, for the OFDMA communication system receives a signal, and<br>
performs radio processing on the received signal. The operation of performing<br>
radio processing on the received signal indicates an operation of performing the<br>
down-conversion to an IF band, A/D conversion, S/P conversion and FFT<br><br>
operation on the received signal. In step 713 the SS determines if a current time<br>
interval is a control data time interval. If it is determined that the current time<br>
interval is the control data time interval, the SS receives in step 715 control data<br>
including the CQI feedback quantities, scheduling information and modulation<br>
scheme information, and then ends its operation.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 713 that the current time interval is<br>
not the control data time interval, i.e. the current time interval is not the user data<br>
time interval, then the SS channel-estimates the radio-processed received signal to<br>
estimate a C/I for each subcarrier in step 717. Thereafter, in step 719, the SS<br>
generates a partial CQI according to CQI feedback quantities included in<br>
previously received control data, and then proceeds to step 721. The process of<br>
generating a partial CQI is equal to the partial CQI generation process described<br>
with reference to FIG. 5. In step 721, the SS generates an average CQI by<br>
averaging the C/Is for respective subcarriers. In step 723, the SS selects<br>
subcarriers according to scheduling information included in the control data and<br>
demodulates the selected subcarrier signal according to modulation scheme<br>
information included in the control data to restore the subcarrier signal to original<br>
user data.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, the present<br>
invention performs scheduling based on a Max C/I scheme using CQIs fed back<br>
for only particular subcarriers in a multicarrier communication system, thereby<br>
maintaining a level of fairness between the SSs, maximizing throughput, and<br>
minimizing complexity. Advantages of the present invention are summarized<br>
below.<br>
(1)	Minimization of CQI Feedback Quantity<br>
As a communication system evolves into a multicarrier communication<br>
system, the CQI feedback for the multiple carriers functions as uplink load and<br>
uplink interference. The CQI feedback quantity can be reduced by feeding back a<br>
partial CQI proposed by the present invention.<br>
(2)	Minimization of Scheduling Complexity<br>
Scheduling complexity is important in a multicarrier communication<br>
system, because it is related to the cost of the devices. Particularly, in the<br>
multicarrier communication system, the use of the MF scheme and the PF scheme,<br>
which are conventional scheduling schemes, increases in the scheduling<br>
complexity by geometric progression, disabling their implementation. Therefore,<br><br>
there is no choice but to use the Max C/I scheme having the minimum complexity.<br>
However, in the multicarrier communication system in which the Max C/I scheme<br>
is used, feeding back of a full CQI reduces the level of fairness between users<br>
undesirably. Therefore, the present invention performs scheduling based on the<br>
Max C/I scheme by feeding back a partial CQI, thereby guaranteeing throughput<br>
while increasing fairness between users.<br>
(3) Harmony between Entire Throughput and Fairness between Users<br>
In an actual communication system, it is not possible to disregard the<br>
fairness between users to maximize the entire throughput, and vice versa.<br>
Therefore, a scheduling scheme that considers both the entire throughput and the<br>
fairness between users, which have the opposite characteristics, has the highest<br>
scheduling efficiency, and the adaptive scheduling scheme proposed by the<br>
present invention considers both the entire throughput and the fairness between<br>
users and has excellent performance.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
