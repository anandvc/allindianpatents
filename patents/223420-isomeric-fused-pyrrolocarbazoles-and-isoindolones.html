				<td>ISOMERIC FUSED PYRROLOCARBAZOLES AND ISOINDOLONES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazoles and<br>
isoindolones, including pharmaceutical compositions, diagnostic kits, assay standards or<br>
reagents containing the same, and methods of using the same as therapeutics. The invention is<br>
also directed to intermediates and processes for making these novel compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The microbial-derived material referred to as "K-252a" is a unique compound which<br>
has gained significant attention over the past several years due to the variety of functional<br>
activities which it possesses. K-252a is an indolocarbazole alkaloid that was originally<br>
isolated from a Nocardlosis sp. culture (Kasc, H et al. 39 J. Antibiotics 1059, 1986). K-252a<br>
is an inhibitor of several enzymes, including protein kinase C (PKC) which plays a central role<br>
in regulating cell functions, and trk tyrosine kinase. The reported functional activities of K-<br>
252a and its derivatives are numerous and diverse: tumor inhibition (See U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,877,776, 4,923,986, and 5,063330; European Publication 238,011 in the name of Nomato);<br>
anti-insecticidal activity (See U.S. Patent No. 4,735,939); inhibition of inflammation (See U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,816,450); treatment of diseases associated with neuronal cells (See U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,461,146; 5,621,100; 5,621,101; and WIPO Publication WO 94/02488, published<br>
February 3, 1994 in the names of Cephalon, Inc. and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd.); and<br>
treatment of prostate disease (See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,516,771; and 5,654,427). K-252a also<br>
has been reported to inhibit IL-2 production (See Grove, O.S. et al., Experimental Cell<br>
Research 193: 175-182,1991).<br>
The reported indolocarbazoles share several common attributes. In particular, each<br>
comprises three five member rings which all include a nitrogen moiety; staurosporinc (derived<br>
from Streptomyces sp.) and K-252a each further comprise a sugar moiety linked via two N-<br>
glycosidic bonds. Both K-252a and staurosporinc have been extensively studied with respect<br>
to their utility as therapeutic agents. The indolocarbazoles are generally lypophilic, which<br>
allows for their comparative ease in crossing biological membranes, and, unlike proteinaceous<br>
materials, they manifest a longer in vivo half-life.<br>
Although K-252a is normally derived from culture media via a fermentation process,<br>
the total synthesis of the natural (+) isomer and the unnatural (-) isomer, in which the three<br>
chiral carbons of the sugar have the opposite configurations, has been achieved (See Wood et<br>
ah, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117: 10413,1995, and WIPO Publication WO 97/07081). However,<br>
this synthesis is not practical for commercial use.<br>
In addition to the indoiocarbazole alkaloids represented by K-252a and siaurosporine.<br>
synthetic small organic molecules which are biologically active and known as fused<br>
pyrrolocarbazoles have been prepared (See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,475,110: 5,591.855; 5,594.009:<br>
5,705,511; and 5,616,724).<br>
Fused isoindolones which are non-indole-containing molecules that can be chemically<br>
synthesized de novo are also known (See U.S. Patent No. 5,808,060 and WIPO Publication<br>
WO 97/21677). Certain bis-indolylmaleimide macrocyciic derivatives have also been<br>
reported (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 5,710,145; 5,672,618; 5,552,396 and 5,545,636).<br>
Sugar derivatives of indolopyrrolocarbazoles also have been reported (see WIPO Publication<br>
WO98/07433). There remains a need for novel pyrrolocarbazole and isoindolone derivatives<br>
that possess beneficial properties. This invention is directed to this, as well as other, important<br>
ends.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide novel compounds which<br>
are kinase inhibitors. Particularly, the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of trk<br>
kinase, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase, vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor receptor (VEGFR) kinase, or NGF-stimulated trk phosphorylation. Another object of<br>
the invention is to provide novel compounds which enhance the trophic factor-induced<br>
activities of trophic factor responsive cells.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions I<br>
having activity toward trk kinase, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase,<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) kinase, NGF-stimulated trk<br>
phosphorylation, or tropic factor responsive cells wherein the composition comprises a<br>
pharmaceutical ly acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of<br>
the compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel method for treating or<br>
preventing disorders associated with the aberrant activity of trk kinase, platelet derived growth<br>
factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase, vascular endothclial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) kinase,<br>
NGF-stimulated trk phosphorylation, or tropic factor responsive cells, wherein the method<br>
comprises administering to a host in need of such treatment or prevention a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for inhibiting trk<br>
kinase, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase, vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor receptor (VEGFR) kinase, NGF-stimulated trk phosphorylation, or enhancing tropic<br>
factor responsive cell activity, in a body fluid sample wherein the method comprises treating<br>
the body fluid sample with an effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present<br>
invention.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a kit or container containing at<br>
least one of the compounds of the present invention in an amount effective for use as a<br>
diagnostic, standard or reagent.<br>
These and other objects, which will become apparent during the following detailed<br>
description, have been achieved by the inventor's discovery that compounds of Formula I:<br>

As used herein, "prodrug" is intended to include any covalently bonded carriers which<br>
release the active parent drug according to Formula (I) or other formulas or compounds of the<br>
present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Since<br>
prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g.,<br>
solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention contemplates prodrugs of the claimed<br>
compounds, compositions containing the same, and methods of delivering the same. Prodrugs<br>
of a compound of the present invention, for example Formula I, may be prepared by<br>
modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are<br>
cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Accordingly,<br>
prodrugs include, for example, compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino,<br>
or carboxy group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a<br>
mammalian subject, cleaves to form a five hydroxyl, free amino, or carboxylic acid,<br>
respectively. Examples include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate<br>
derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl<br>
esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl,<br>
cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl, and phenethyl esters, and the like.<br>
Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. The compounds can be synthesized, for example, by the<br>
methods described below, or variations thereon as appreciated by the skilled artisan. All<br>
processes disclosed in association with the present invention are contemplated to be practiced<br>
on any scale, including milligram, gram, multigram, kilogram, multikilogram or commercial<br>
industrial scale.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention may contain one or<br>
more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or<br>
racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric<br>
forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is<br>
specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically<br>
active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard<br>
techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase,<br>
and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, rccrystallization. and the like, or by<br>
chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral<br>
centers.<br>
As will be readily understood, functional groups present on the compounds of Formula<br>
I may contain protecting groups during the course of synthesis. For example, the amino acid<br>
side chain substituents of the compounds of Formula I can be substituted with protecting<br>
groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known<br>
per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and removed from<br>
functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are present in a<br>
chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction conditions to which<br>
the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups may be employed with the<br>
present invention. Preferred protecting groups include the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz; Z) group<br>
and the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Other preferred protecting groups according to the<br>
invention may be found in Greene, T.W. and Wuts, P.G.M., Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis 2d. Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be prepared as outlined in the following<br>
schemes. Generally, imide compounds may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1.<br>
A cycloaddition reaction with maleimide and a cyclic-2-vinyl derivative (II) gives the<br>
tetrahydrocarfoazole compounds of general structure (III), which can be dehydrogcnated by<br>
methods well known in the art (Scheme 1). The cycloaddition reaction may be carried out in<br>
the absence of a solvent at temperatures of about 1 SO to about 200 °C, or in a solvent such as<br>
toluene, xylene or chlorobenzene at elevated temperatures with or without an added Lewis<br>
acid catalyst. The dienes of general structure (II) may be prepared by addition of a 2-lithio<br>
indole species, substituted or unsubstituted, to a cyclic (hetero)aryl 1-ketone, for example, 1-<br>
indanone, 1-tetralone, 4-chromanonc, 4-keto-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothianaphthlene, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted, as described, for example, in Tetrahedron Lett.1985, 26, S93S, the disclosure of<br>

compounds wherein G-X-W is -C(=O)-N(R1)-C(B1B2)- or -C(A1A2)-N(RI)-C(=O)-.<br>
Cycloaddition reaction of diencs of general structure III with ethyl cis-b-cyanoacry late under<br>
conditions described for imides in Scheme 1 produces the cyanoester tetrahyrocarbazole<br>
regioisomers of general structures V and VI. Standard procedures such as recrystallization or<br>
chromatography may be used to separate the resulting regioisomers V and VI. The<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole cyano-esters may be readily dehydrogenated according to conventional<br>
processes with, for example, 2,3-dichloro-4,5-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone to produce the<br>
aromatized carbazoles of general structure VII and VIII (Scheme 2). Lactams of general<br>
structure IX and X may be prepared separately or as a mixture by reductive cyclization of the<br>
nhrile-esters using reducing agents, for example, raney nickel/Hj, PdO. and Pd or Pt on<br>
activated charcoal. The imide derivative IV may also be readily be reduced to lactam isomers<br>
IX and X by conventional processes such as zinc amalgam-HCI, Zn in acetic acid, or by<br>
treatment with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride. Standard processes<br>
such as recrystallization or chromatography may separate the resulting lactam regioisomers.<br>
Compounds in which G-X-W is -CH(RlA)-C(=O)-N(R1)- or -N(R1)-C(=O)-CH(R1A)-,<br>
as well as those in which G-X-W is a lactam or imide can be prepared by methods taught, for<br>
example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,616,724, and 5.801,190, the disclosures of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Compounds containing heteroaryl groups in rings B or F may be prepared using the<br>
described methods as demonstrated in Schemes 3 and 4. The phenyl ring of the indole may be<br>
a heterocycle, for example, but not limited to, 7-azaindole.<br>
Although the resulting alcohol derivative of general structure (I-i) shown in Scheme I<br>
may be dehydrated to compounds of general structure (II) using conditions known in the art<br>
5 such as HC1 in acetone or p-toluenesulfonic acid in benzene, dienes of general structure (II)<br>
may be also be prepared using palladium catalyzed cross coupling methodology. For<br>
example, coupling an appropriate bromo, iodo or a trifluoromethane sulfonate derivative with<br>
a 2-stannyl- or 2-boronicacid tndole derivative as shown in Scheme 5.<br>
The tetrahydrocarbazole cycloaddition adducts III can be readily dehydrogenated<br>
according to conventional processes with, for example, with 2.3-dichloro-4.5-dicyano-1.4-<br>
benzoquinone to give the aromatized carbazoles of general structure IV (Scheme 1).<br>
Scheme 6 outlines an alternative method to prepare lactam isomer of general structure<br>
X. A diene of general structure II, substituted or unsubstituted, is reacted with oxalyl chloride<br>
and an alcohol to produce keto-esters of general structure XIX. Olefination reactions known<br>
to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis, for example, reaction of ketone XIX with<br>
diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate, readily produces cyano-ester XX. Aromatic ring closure,<br>
under palladium catalyzed or oxidative conditions gives the cyano-ester carbazole of general<br>
structure XXI (Scheme 6) or VIII (Scheme 2). Reductive cyclization produces the iactam of<br>
general structure X (Scheme 2,6).<br>
Compounds of the present invention in which general structures IV, IX or X have<br>
Y = CH2 may be further substituted as shown in Scheme 7.<br>
Generally, compounds in which R6 is hydrogen, can be alkylated in the presence of<br>
base (e.g., hydrides, alkoxides, hydroxides of alkali or alkaline earth metals, or of organo-<br>
lithium compounds) by treatment with R6L in which L is a leaving group such as a<br>
halogen. The resulting pyrrolocarbazole may have an alkyl group, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted bound to the indole nitrogen, for example IV-20.41. Compounds of general<br>
formula IV, IX or X, in which R6 is N-hydrogen may be subjected to Michael reaction<br>
conditions using a base, such as DBU and a Michael acceptor, such as an acrylic acid<br>
derivative or acrylonitrile to produce compounds IV-20-22. Reactions of this type may be<br>
further understood by reference to Scheme 8.<br>
Palladium catalysed Heck reaction using IV-9 and a coupling partner such as a<br>
vinyl aryl or herteroaryl derivative, acrylic acid derivative or acrylonitrile produces vinyl<br>
derivatives IV-36, 37. 39,43. The vinyl derivative may be reduced to the alkane<br>
derivatives such as IV-38, 40 using reducing conditions such as Palladium on carbon<br>
under a hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
Other features of the invention will become apparent in the course of the following<br>

illustrative purposes, wherein each entry corresponds to the accompanying structure.<br>
Utility<br>
The isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazoles and isoindolones of the present invention are<br>
useful, inter alia, as therapeutic agents. Particularly, the compounds are useful for kinase<br>
inhibition. The isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazoles and isoindolones have been shown to inhibit,<br>
for example, one or more of trk kinase, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)<br>
kinasc. vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) kinase. or NGF-stimulated trk<br>
phosphorylation.<br>
The properties of the compounds of the present invention are beneficial in therapeutic<br>
settings. The activities of the fused pyrrolocarbazoles and isoindolones toward certain<br>
enzymes can be exploited to combat the deleterious consequences of these enzymes.<br>
Particularly, inhibition of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) implies<br>
utility in, for example, diseases where angiogenesis plays important roles, such as cancer of<br>
solid tumors, endometriosis, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, hemangioblastoma, as well as<br>
other ocular diseases and cancers. Inhibition of irk implies utility in, for example, diseases of<br>
the prostate such as prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia, and treatment of<br>
inflammatory pain. Inhibition of the Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR)<br>
implies utility in. for example, various forms of neoplasia. rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary1<br>
fibrosis, myelofibrosis. abnormal wound healing, diseases with cardiovascular end points,<br>
such as atherosclerosis, rcstenosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, and the like.<br>
The activities of isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazoles and isoindolones have also been<br>
shown to have positive effects on the function and survival of trophic factor responsive cells<br>
by promoting the survival of neurons. With respect to the survival of a cholinergic neuron, for<br>
example, the compound may preserve the survival of a cholinergic neuronal population at risk<br>
of dying (due to, e.g., injury, a disease condition, a degenerative condition or natural<br>
progression) when compared to a cholinergic neuronal population not presented with such<br>
compound, if the treated population has a comparatively greater period of functionality than<br>
the non-treated population.<br>
A variety of neurological disorders are characterized by neuronal cells which are<br>
dying, injured, functionally compromised, undergoing axonal degeneration, at risk of dying,<br>
etc. These disorders include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer1s disease; motor neuron<br>
disorders (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); Parkinson1s disease; cerebrovascular disorders<br>
(e.g., stroke, ischaemia); Huntingdon1s disease; AIDS dementia; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis;<br>
peripheral neuropathies (e.g., those affecting DRG neurons in chemotherapy-associated<br>
peripheral neuropathy) including diabetic neuropathy; disorders induced by excitatory amino<br>
acids; and disorders associated with concussive or penetrating injuries of the brain or spinal<br>
cord.<br>
The compounds are not only useful for enhancing trophic factor-induced activities of<br>
trophic responsive cells, e.g., cholinergic neurons, but also may function as survival promoting<br>
agents for other neuronal cell types, e.g., dopaminergic or glutamatergic. Growth factor may<br>
regulate survival of neurons by signaling cascades downstream of the small GTP binding<br>
proteins ras. rac, and cdc42 (Denhardt, D.T.. Biochem. J., 1996, 318, 729). Specifically,<br>
activation of ras leads to phosphorylation and activation of extracellular receptor-activated<br>
kinase (ERR), which has been linked to biological growth and differentiation processes.<br>
Stimulation of rac/cdc42 leads to an increase in activation of JNK and p38, responses<br>
that are associated with stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. Although growth factor<br>
responses are primarily via the ERK pathway, affecting these latter processes may lead to<br>
alternative mechanisms of neuronal survival which may mimic growth factor enhancing<br>
survival properties (Xia et al., Science, 1995, 270, 1326). The compounds may also function<br>
as survival promoting agents for neuronal and non-neuronal cells by mechanisms related to.<br>
but also distinct from, growth factor mediated survival, for example, inhibition of the JNK and<br>
p38 MAPK pathways which may lead to survival by inhibition of apoptotic cell death<br>
processes.<br>
The present compounds are also useful in the treatment of disorders associated with<br>
decreased ChAT activity or the death, injury to spinal cord motoneurons, and also have utility<br>
in, for example, diseases associated with apoptotic cell death of the central and peripheral<br>
nervous system, immune system and in inflammatory diseases. ChAT catalyzes the synthesis<br>
of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and it is considered an enzymatic marker for a<br>
functional cholinergic neuron. A functional neuron is also capable of survival. Neuron<br>
survival is assayed by quamitation of the specific uptake and enzymatic conversion of a dye<br>
(e.g., calcein AM) by living neurons. The compounds described herein may also find utility in<br>
the treatment of disease states involving malignant cell proliferation, such as many cancers.<br>
Because of their varied utilities, the properties of isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazoles and<br>
isoindolones may be exploited in other settings, such as research. For example, the<br>
compounds can be used in the development of in vitro models of neuronal cell survival,<br>
function, identification, or for the screening of other synthetic compounds which have<br>
activities similar to that of the of isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazole and isoindolone compounds.<br>
Thus, the compounds provided by this invention are useful as standard or reference<br>
compounds for use in tests or assays for determining the activity of an agent in a<br>
pharmaceutical research program.<br>
The compounds can also be utilized to investigate, define and determine molecular<br>
targets associated with functional responses. For example, by radiolabelling an isomeric fused<br>
pyrrolocarbazole or isoindolone compound associated with a specific cellular function (e.g.,<br>
mitogenesis), the target entity to which the derivative binds can be identified, isolated, and<br>
purified for characterization. By way of further illustration, compounds may be used in the<br>
development of assays and models for further enhancement of the understanding of the roles<br>
that inhibition of serine/threonine or tyrosine protein kinase (e.g., PK.C, trk tyrosine kinase)<br>
play in the mechanistic aspects of the associated disorders and diseases. Thus, the compounds<br>
of the present invention are useful as diagnostic reagents in diagnostic assays, such as the<br>
assays described herein.<br>
The inhibition of enzymatic activity by the isomeric fused pyrrolocarbazole and<br>
isoindolone compounds of the present invention can be determined using, for example, the<br>
following assays:<br>
1. Vascular Endothclial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) kinase inhibition assay;<br>
2. trk A Tyrosine Kinase Activity inhibition assay;<br>
3. PKC activity inhibition assay; and<br>
4. Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) inhibition assay.<br>

phosphorylated product was done by adding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-<br>
phosphotyrosine antibody (UBI). The HRP substrate solution containing 3, 31-5, 5-<br>
tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide was later added and the plates were incubated for<br>
10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with acid and the resulting<br>
absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Microplate Bio-kinetics Reader (Bio-Tek Instrument<br>
EL 312c). Inhibition data were analyzed using the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope)<br>
equation in GraphPad Prism. The results are summarized in Table 7.<br>
Dosage and Formulation<br>
For therapeutic purposes, the compounds of the present invention can be administered<br>
by any means that results in the contact of the active agent with the agent1s site of action in the<br>
body of a mammal. The compounds may be administered by any conventional means<br>
available for use in conjunction with Pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents<br>
or in a combination of therapeutic agents. They are preferably administered as the sole active<br>
agent in a pharmaceutical composition, but alternatively, they can be used in combination with<br>
other active ingredients, e.g., other growth factors which facilitate neuronal survival or axonal<br>
regeneration in diseases or disorders. The compounds are preferably combined with a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard<br>
pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The compounds can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions, for example, by<br>
admixture with pharmaceutical iy acceptable nontoxic excipients and carriers. Such<br>
compositions can be prepared for use in parenteral administration, particularly in the form of<br>
liquid solutions or suspensions; or oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets or<br>
capsules; or intranasally, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or<br>
dermally, via, for example, trans-dermal patches.<br>
The composition can be conveniently administered in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art. for example, as<br>
described in Remington1s Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co.. Easton, PA. 1980).<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may contain as common excipients sterile water or<br>
saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol. oils and vegetable origin,<br>
hydrogenated naphthalenes and the like. In particular, biocompatible. biodegradable lactide<br>
polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may<br>
be useful excipients to control the release of the active compounds.<br>
Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for these active compounds<br>
include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion<br>
systems, and iiposomes. Formulations for inhalation administration contain as excipients. for<br>
example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-<br>
lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of<br>
nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Formulations for parenteral administration<br>
may also include glycocholate for buccal administration, a salicylate for rectal administration,<br>
or citric acid for vaginal administration. Formulations for trans-dermal patches are preferably<br>
iipophilic emulsions.<br>
Compounds of Formula I and pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts thereof can be<br>
administered orally or non-oral ly, e.g., as an ointment or an injection. The concentrations of<br>
the compounds of this invention in a therapeutic composition can vary. The concentration will<br>
depend upon factors such as the total dosage, of the drug to be administered, the chemical<br>
characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity) of the compounds employed, the route of administration,<br>
the age, body weight and symptoms of a patient, etc.. The compounds of this invention may<br>
be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to 10% w/v<br>
compound for parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from about 1 mg to about<br>
1 ug/kg of body weight per day: a preferred dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg<br>
of body weight per day, and preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg once to four times per day. A<br>
preferred dosage of drug to be administered is likely to depend on variables such as the type<br>
and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular<br>
patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, and formulation of the<br>
compound excipient, and its route of administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention can be<br>
prepared by uniformly mixing an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient, with a pharmaceuticaliy<br>
acceptable carrier. The carrier may take a wide range of forms according to the forms of<br>
composition suitable for administration. It is desired that such pharmaceutical compositions<br>
are prepared in a unit dose form suitable for oral or non-oral administration. The forms for<br>
non-oral administration include ointment and injection.<br>
Tablets can be prepared using excipients such as lactose, glucose, sucrose, mannitol<br>
and methyl cellulose, disintegrating agents such as starch, sodium aiginate. calcium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose and crystalline cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearatc and<br>
talc, binders such as gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose and methyl cellulose, surfactants such as sucrose fatty acid ester and sorbitol fatty<br>
acid ester, and the like in a conventional manner. It is preferred that each tablet contains 15-<br>
300 mg of the active ingredient.<br>
Granules can be prepared using excipients such as lactose and sucrose, disintegrating<br>
agents such as starch, binders such as gelatin, and the like in a conventional manner. Powders<br>
