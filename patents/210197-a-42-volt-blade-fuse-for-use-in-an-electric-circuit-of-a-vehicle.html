FUSE AND FUSE SUPPORT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fuse, and more particularly, to a fuse and fuse support ^of an automobile electric circuit.<br>
The electric wires of electric devices installed in automobiles lead to a fuse box. The fuse box accommodates fuses, each of which corresponds to the capacity of the associated electric device. The electric wires are connected to a battery via fuses and switches, such as an ignition switch. Each fuse melts when excessive current flows through the fuse. This protects the associated electric device from the excessive current.<br>
A typical electric system of an automobile generates 14V and store' 12V. That is, an alternator generates 14V, and a battery stores 12V. In such electric system, the rated voltage of a fuse is 32V and the breaking characteristic of a fuse is 32Vxl000A (rated voltage x rated breaking current).<br>
However, the number of electronic controllers installed in automobiles has been increasing recently. Thus, the power supply capacity of a system that generates 14V and stores 12V has become insufficient. As a result, it is predicted that systems generating 42V and storing 32V will be employed in lieu of conventional systems. Accordingly, a fuse having a rated voltage greater than 42V will be necessary for the 42V generation systems. Further, it can be predicted that a system that generates 14V and stores i2V may be used.-together with a system that generates 42V and stores 32V.<br><br>
The dimension of a fuse is substantially determined in accordance with an automobile industry standard. Thus, when a system that generates 14V and stores 12V is used together with a system that generates 42V and stores 32V, a 14V fuse may inadvertently be installed in the 42V system.<br>
If, for example, a 14V system fuse (14V fuse) is inadvertently installed in a 42V system, excessive current would melt the 14V fuse. Subsequent to the. melting of the 14V fuse, the insulation resistance of the 14V fuse would become insufficient and cause an arc discharge. When an arc discharge continues, the synthetic resin housing of the fuse may melt.<br>
To prevent arc discharge, arc-extinguishing sand may be contained in a fuse. However, this would enlarge the fuse and, in turn, enlarge the fuse box that holds the fuse.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuse and fuse support that prevents erroneous installation.<br>
To achieve the above object, the first aspect of the present invention provides a fuse including two substantially parallel terminals, each terminal having a distal end and a • basal end, a fuse line connecting the two terminals, and a housing for accommodating the basal ends of the two terminals and the fuse line.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A fuse 11 and a fuse support, or fuse box 19, according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. In the drawings, like numerals are used for like elements throughout.<br>
As shown in Fig. la, the fuse box 19, which is used in<br><br>
a 42V system, includes a frame 19a .and a cover 19b. A fuse compartment 27 is defined in the frame 19a. Pairs of guide blocks 21 (only one pair shown) are. arranged in the frame 19a. A blade fuse (42V fuse) 11 is fitted between each pair of guide blocks 21.<br>
Referring to Figs, lb and 2, the 42V fuse 11 has an input terminal 12, an output terminal 13, a fuse line 14, which connects the two terminals 12, 13, and a housing 15, which covers the fuse line 14.<br>
The housing 15 has a thin profile and is preferably made of a heat resistant and transparent synthetic resin. The housing 15 includes a plate-like head 15d and a body 15c, which is formed integrally with the head 15d. An internal space is defined in the body 15c. The internal space includes terminal receptacles 15a and a fuse line receptacle<br>
15b. The fuse line receptacle 15b receives the fuse line 14.<br><br>
The input terminal 12 and the output terminal 13 respectively have basal ends 12a, 13a, which are fixed to the corresponding terminal receptacles 15a, and distal ends 12b, 13b, which project from the housing 15. The distal ends 12b, 13b each have a substantially uniform thickness. The width SI of the terminals 12, 13 is 2.8±0.2ram to comply with automobile industry standards. Each of the distal ends 12b, 13b has a tapered .portion 17. The remaining part^ of each of the distal ends 12b, 13b is straight. Each tapered portion 17 becomes narrower as the distance from the basal ends 12a, 13a increases.<br>
The curved fuse line 14 connects the basal end •I2a of the input terminal 12 with the basal end 12a of the output<br><br>
terminal 13. The input terminal 12, the output terminal 13, and the fuse line 14 are formed integrally by punching a metal sheet.<br>
The form of the housing 15 will now be described. Referring'to Figs.l, 3, and 4, the body 15c has relatively wide front and rear walls 30, 31 and relatively narrow right and left walls 32, 33. The front and rear walls 30, 31 each have two stepped portions 18 and a thin projection 26 located between the stepped portions 18. Each stepped portion 18 is flat and extends in the longitudinal direction of the input and output terminals 12, 13. As shown in Fig. 4, the thickness ul of the body 15c at where the projection 26 (thick portion) is located is about four millimeters to comply with automobile industry standards. The thickness tl of the body 15c where each stepped portion 18 is located is less than the thickness ul of the thick portion.<br>
The input terminal 12 and the output terminal 13 are each fitted into a socket 20, which extends into the 42V fuse box 19. Each socket 20 accommodates an electrode 23 (Fig. 2) connected to a battery and an electric device (neither shown). The input terminal 12 and the output terminal 13 are electrically connected to the associated electrode 23. The battery has the capability to supply 42V and to store 32V.<br>
The guide blocks 21 are formed’ to surround an opening 20a of each socket 20. A guide groove 22 extends through each guide block 21. The width t2 of the guide groove 22 is substantially the same as the thickness tl of the housing 15 at the stepped portion 18. The opposing pair of guide blocks „ 21 supports the 42V fuse 11.<br><br>
The differences between a typical 14V fuse 111 used in a system that generates 14V and stores 12V and the 42V fuse<br>
II	will now be discussed.. As shown in Fig*. 5, the 14V fuse<br>
III	has an input terminal 112 and an output terminal 113.<br>
Basal ends of the input and output terminals 112, 113 are<br>
accommodated in a housing.115. The. housing 115 has a body<br>
115c with a front wall 30 and a rear wall 31, each of which<br>
includes a thin projection 126, two side walls 125, and two<br>
channels 124.. The channels 124 extend in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the input and output terminals 112, 113. The<br>
thickness dl of the body 15c where each side wall 125 is<br>
formed is about four millimeters to comply with automobile<br>
industry standards. Thus, the width dl of the side walls 125<br>
is substantially the same as the thickness ul at the thick<br>
portion of the 42V fuse 11.<br>
Pairs of guide blocks 121 (only one pair shown) for the 14V fuses 111 are formed on a 14V fuse box 119. A guide groove 122 extends along each guide block 121. The width d2 of the guide groove 122 is substantially the same as the width dl of the side walls 125. The width s2 of the input and output terminals 112, 113 is 2.8±0.2mm. The dimensions of the other parts of the 14V fuse 111 are substantially the same 'as the corresponding parts of the 42V fuse 11.<br>
The electric characteristics of the 42V fuse and the 14V fuse 111 will now be discussed. The rated voltage of the-42V fuse 11 is 55V and the breaking characteristic of the 42V fuse is 55Vxl000A (rated voltage x rated breaking current). The fusion time of the 14V fuse 111 is substantially the same as that of the 42V fuse 11. The fusion time refers to the time required for the fuse line 14 to melt when an excessive current, which is greater than a predetermined current value,<br><br>
flows through the fuse line 14.<br>
An example of the relationship between the rated current and the fusion time of the fuse line 14 will now be discussed. The fuse line 14 is capable of withstanding a current corresponding to 110% of the rated current for over 100 hours. The fuse line 14 melts within 0.75 to 1,800 seconds when a current corresponding to 135% of the rated current flows through the fuse line 14. The fuse line 14 melts within 0.15 to 5 seconds when a current corresponding to 200% of the rated current flows through the fuse line 14. The fuse line 14 melts within 0.04 to 0.5 seconds when a current corresponding to 350% of the rated current flows through the fuse line 14. The fuse line 14 melts within 0.02 to 0.2 seconds when a current corresponding to 600% of the rated current flows through the fuse line 14.<br>
The connection of the 42V fuse 11 to the 42V fuse box 19 will now bqdiscussed. The stepped portions 18 (narrow portions) of the 42V fuse 11 are each engaged with the guide groove 22 of the corresponding guide block 21. The 42V fuse 11 is moved along the guide grooves 22 until the distal ends 12b, 13b are fit into the associated sockets 20. This connects the distal ends 12b, 13b to the electrodes 23.<br>
The guide grooves 22 serve to facilitate the connection of the 42V fuse 11. Further, the connected 42V fuse 11 is supported by the guide block 21, which prevents the 42V fuse 11 from falling.<br>
Since the width t2 of the guide grooves 22 is less that the width dl of the side walls 125 of the 14V fuse 111', the guide blocks 21 prevent the connection of the 14V fuse 111.<br><br>
This prevents the 14V fuse 111 from being inadvertently connected to the 42V fuse box 19.<br>
On the other hand, the 42V fuse 11 may be connected to the 14V fuse box 119. The width d2 of the guide grooves 122 ■ of the guide blocks 121 is greater than the thickness Tl of the narrow portion of the 42V fuse 11. This permits the 42V fuse 11 to be received by the pair 6f the guide blocks 121. Further, the 42V fuse 11 and the 14V fuse 111 are formed so that the terminal widths is, s2, the terminal thickness, and the distance between the terminals 12, 13 and 112, 113 comply with the same standard. Thus, the 42V fuse 11 may easily be inserted into the sockets 120 and connected with electrodes (not shown) of the 14V system.<br>
If the 42V fuse 11 is used in lieu of the 14V fuse 111, excessive current melts the fuse line 14 of the 42V fuse 11 within a predetermined time. Thus, the employment of the 42V fuse 11 does   cause problems. Further, since the rated voltage of the 42V fuse 11 is greater than the voltage of the 14V system, an arc is not formed when the 42V fuse 11 is being used.<br>
The first embodiment has the advantages described below.<br>
(1)	The thickness tl of the stepped portions 18 of the 42V fuse 11 is less than the width dl of the side walls 125 of the 14V fuse 111. The dimensional difference between the stepped portions 18 and the side walls 125 prevent erroneous connection of the 14V fuse 111 to the guide blocks 21 of the 42V fuse 11.<br>
(2)	The thickness tl of the narrow portion of the 42V<br><br>
fuse 11 is less than the width dl of the side walls of the fuse 111 and the width d2 of the guide grooves 122. The remaining parts of the 42V fuse 11.and th^ 14V fuse 111 have substantially the same dimensions- Thus, the 42V fuse 11, which has a large rated voltage, is easily connected to the 14V fuse box 119.<br>
(3)	The fusion time of the 42V fuse 11 relative to current exceeding the rated current of the fuse line 14 is substantially the same as that of the 14V fuse 11. Thus, the 42V fuse 11 may be used on the 14V fuse box 119.<br>
(4)	The width t2 of the guide grooves 22 in the 42V fuse box. 19 is less than the width d2 of the guide grooves 122 in the 14V fuse box 119. This easily prevents erroneous connection of the 14V fuse 111, which is now widely used, to the 42V fuse box 19.<br>
A fuse ll and a fuse box 19 according to a second embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to Figs. 6 to 8. The input terminal 12 and the output terminal 13 of the 42V fuse 11 have a width si that is less than the terminal width s2 of the 14V fuse 111 of Fig. 5. Thus, the width's2 is less than 2.8±0.2mm. In accordance with the narrow terminals 12, 13, the sockets 20 of the 42V fuse box 19, or the size of the openings 20a, is smaller than the size of the opening 120a of the 14V fuse box 119 of Fig. 5. The relatively small sockets 20 prevent erroneous connection of the 14V fuse 111. The guide blocks 21 are eliminated in the second embodiment.<br>
The connection of the 14V fuse 111 to the 42V flies box 19 will now be discussed- Since the terminals 112, 113 of<br><br>
the 14V fuse 111 are larger than the sockets 20 in the 42V fuse box 19, insertion of the terminals 112, 113 into the sockets 200 is prevented. This prevents connection of the 14V fuse 111 to the 42V fuse box 19,<br>
The connection of the 42V-fuse 11 to the 14V fuse box 119 will now be discussed. Since the terminals 12, 13 of the 42V fuse 11 are smaller than the sockets 120 of the 14V fuse box 119, the 42V fuse 1 are easily connected to the 14V fuse box 119.<br>
The second embodiment has the advantages described below.<br>
(5)	The terminals 12, 13 of the 42V fuse 11 and the opening 20a of each socket 20 in the 42V fuse box 19 are smaller than the terminals 112, 113 of the 14V fuse 111. This restricts the insertion of the 14V fuse 111 into the sockets 20 of/the 42V fuse box 19.<br>
(6)	The terminals 12, 13 of the 42V fuse 11 are smaller than the opening 120a of each socket 120 in the 14V fuse box 119. Thus, the 42V fuse 11, the rated voltage of which is high,’ is easily connected to the 14V fuse box 119.<br>
(7)	The opening 20a of each socket 20 in the 42V fuse bog 19 is narrower than the terminals 112, 113 of the 14V fuse 111. This easily prevents erroneous connection of the 14V fuse 111, which is now widely used, to the 42V fuse box 19.<br>
(8)	The 42V fuse 11 includes the stepped portions 18 and the narrow terminals 12, 13. Thus, the 42V fuse 11 may<br><br>
easily be connected to, for example, the 42V fuse box 19 of Fig. lb and the 42V fuse box 19 of Fig. 6.<br>
It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from, the spirit or scope of the invention. Particularly, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in the following forms.<br>
In the second embodiment, the guide blocks 21 shown in Fig. lb may be arranged about the sockets 20 of Fig. 6. This facilitates the connection of the 42V fuse 11 to the sockets 20 and prevents the connected 42V fuse 11 from falling.<br>
In the second embodiment, the guide blocks 121 of Fig. 5 may be arranged about the sockets 20 of Fig. 6,- and the side walls 125 of the 14V fuse 111 may be formed on the 4 2V fuse 11. In such case, the relatively small sockets 20 prevent the coimection of the 14V fuse 111. Further, a common housing may be used for the 42V fuse 11 and the 14V fuse 111.<br>
In the first and second embodiments, the rated voltage of the 42V fuse 11 does not have to be 55V as long as it is higher than 42V, such as 50V or 45V.<br>
In the first embodiment, the width si of the stepped portions 18 may be narrower or wider as long as the left and right walls 32, 33 have the width si.<br>
In the first embodiment, the projection 26 of the 42V fuse may be eliminated. In other words, the front and rear walls 30, 31 of the housing 15 may be flat, and the body 15c<br><br>
may have a uniform thickness ul, which is equal to the thickness to of the narrow portion.<br>
The present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalence of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
