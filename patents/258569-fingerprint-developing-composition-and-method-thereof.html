				<td>FINGERPRINT DEVELOPING COMPOSITION AND METHODS THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a nano-sized fingerprint developing powder composition for detecting fingerprints.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conventional procedure for developing a latent fingerprint involves applying to the surface having such fingerprint thereon a small amount of a finely powdered solid material until the outline of the fingerprint becomes visible and then carefully spreading the applied powder over the fingerprint in order to bring out its pattern.<br>
Conventional fingerprint dusting powder pick up prints since the oil secreted by fingertips has a natural tackiness. In the course of time the oil tends to evaporate and, therefore, old fingerprints are difficult to detect by powder method. This problem is specifically relevant to India where hot climate prevails eight out of twelve months in a year. Nanoparticles have the ability to actively seek out oil, however small the amount may be.<br>
WO 2005/066632A1 discloses the use of a nanoparticle of siloxane derivative as the adhesive for fingerprinting composition wherein the particle is encapsulated in a fluorescent material and is derived from a sol-gel. The nanoparticle used is derived from cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide optionally doped with rare earth atoms.<br>

The invention provides a nano-sized fingerprinting dusting composition for detecting latent fingerprints. Composition includes a non-toxic adhesive material coated with a fluorescent dye and hydrophobic seed extract.<br>
The non-toxic adhesive material used is either nanoparticles of aluminium oxide or meshed aluminium oxide. The non-toxic adhesive material has a particle size in the size of range 30-60 nm.<br>
The adhesive particles are coated with a fluorescent dye and a hydrophobic substance. The fluorescent dye is used to enhance weak fingerprints often found at crime scenes, under a light source. The fluorescent dye used is FDA recommended eosin yellow, lucifer yellow, nile red and fluorescein. It is non-toxic and is used for biological staining procedure.<br>
The hydrophobic substance is used to detect fingerprints on moist surfaces. The hydrophobic constituent repels water and allows the powder particles to stick to the oily component of the latent fingerprint, impinged on a wet or sticky surface. The hydrophobic material used in the invention is the seed extract. The seed extract has been prepared from various seeds like gwar bean; french beans, mistletoe and trillium. The extract from these seeds have high sticking characteristics.<br>
A method for the preparation of a novel, non-toxic nano-sized fingerprint developing powder composition is disclosed. The method includes grating the seeds to powder and suspending the powder in a solvent to obtain a suspension, which is then stirred for 2 - 2.5 hours and allowed to stand overnight. The suspension is then filtered and the filtrate is added to the non-toxic adhesive material which has a particle size in the range of 30-60 nm and a surface area of 43 m2g-1. The mixture is sonicated for 1-1.15 hours and the solvent is evaporated under natural conditions to obtain a residue. A fluorescent dye solution is then added to the residue. The mixture is further sonicated for 1-1.15 hours and the solvent evaporated to obtain a residue. The residue thus obtained is ground to a fine. The detailed procedure of the preparation using gwar bean seed extract, French bean seed extract is provided in the Example 1-4.<br>
The invention also provides for a method of detecting fingerprints. The method includes applying the fingerprint developing powder on a sample surface (paper, glass, plastic etc.) with a camel hair brush. The excess powder is blown off from the sample surface having the fingerprint thereon to distribute the powder uniformly on the surface in order to expose<br>
the developed fingerprint. Further the developed sample surface containing the developed fingerprint is photographed or the developed sample surface containing the developed fingerprint is observed under a forensic light source tool. The sample surface is. for example paper, plastic, glass, bakelite, enamelled metals, polished wood, etc. It is particularly useful for detecting latent imprints on glossy, multi-colour surfaces.<br>
