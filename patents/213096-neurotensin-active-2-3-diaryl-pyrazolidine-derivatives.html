The preparation of the compounds having formule (1) and of a number of intermediates according to methods A-D will now be described in detail in the following Examples.<br>
Example 1 Step i (scheme A.1):<br>
To a stirred 50 ml of dry acetonitril at room temperature and under a nitrogen atmosphere, were added: 4 g (14.5 mmol) of II, 2.7 g (14.3 mmol) of N-Boc-L-Alanine and 3.8 g (18.4 mmol) of DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide). A precipitate formed directly. Stirring was continued for one night. Thin layer chromatography of the reaction mixture displays a 8-like double spot containing the two possible diastereomers. The precipitate was removed by filtration. To the filtrate about 20 g of silica was added and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting powder was put on top of a dry column (Si02) after which elution was performed (eluent: CH2CI2/MeOH 98/2). The part of the column containing the two diastereomers was collected and taken into MeOH. The latter suspension was filtered, the residu washed one more time with MeOH. The combined MeOH fractions were concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residu taken into CH2CI2 after which it was dried on MgS04. Removal of the drying<br><br>
agent by filtration and solvent by evaporation in vacuo, ca. 5 g (80%) of crude product was isolated.<br>
Step ii (scheme A.1):<br>
While stirring, the 5 g (ca. 10 mmol). resulting from step i, were dissolved in 100 ml of<br>
a solution consisting of trifluoroacetic acid/CH2CI2/H20 70/25/5. Stirring was<br>
continued for 2 hours. Subsequently the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacua,<br>
the resulting residu was taken into CH2CI2. The latter solution was treated with a<br>
saturated K2C03(aq) solution, and washed with water and brine and eventually dried<br>
on MgS04.<br>
After removal of the drying agent by filtration and the solvent by evapotation in vacua,<br>
4 g (ca. 100%) of the crude amine was isolated.<br>
Step Hi (scheme A.1):<br>
At room temperature and under a nitrogen atmosphere, 0,50 g (1.44 mmol) of the crude amine of step ii was suspended in 10 ml of acetonitril while stirring, Subsequently, 0.26 g (1.44 mmol) of 2-adamantylisocyanate was added. The reaction was continued for 2 hours. To the reaction mixture about 2 g of silica was added and concentrated in vacua. The resulting powder was put on top of a dry column (Si02) after which elution was performed (eluent: EtOAc/petroleum ether 1/1). The parts of the column containing the diastereomers were collected separately, and taken into MeOH. The resulting two suspensions were separately filtered, each of the the two residues washed with MeOH one time. For each diastereomer the corresponding MeOH fractions were combined and concentrated in vacua after which each residue was taken into CH2CI2 after which the two solutions were dried on MgS04. After removal of the drying agent and the solvent in vacua, two solids, each containing one diastereomer, were obtained: 0.16 g of A23 (21%), melting point 140-3 °C, and 0.22 g of A24 (29%) melting point 145-8 °C.<br>
Note:<br>
Compound A12 has been prepared enantiomehcally pure. The intermediate after step ii (scheme A.1), was separated into its enantiomers after which step iii (scheme A.2) was performed. The (+)- enantiomer of A12 was the eutomer.<br><br><br>
The separation into the enantiomers of the intermediate after step ii (scheme A.1) was accomplished by using a Chiralcel CD column (25x5 cm2, 2Oµ, eluent: hexane/ethanol 4/1),<br>
The compounds of Table A have been prepared in the same manner:<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Step Hi (scheme B.1):<br>
0.20 g (0,67 mmol) of triphosgene was dissolved in 10 ml of dry dichloromethane. To the latter mixture a solution of 0,70 g (2.0 mmol) of the pyrazolidine derivative and 0.42 ml (2.4 mmol) di-isopropylethylamine was added in a period of 45 minutes. The reactionmixture was stirred continuously. Subsequently, a solution containing 0.33 g (2.0 mmol) of methyl-2-adamantyl amine and 0.42 ml (2.4 mmol) of di-isopropylethyl¬amine in 5 ml of dry dichoromethane, was added to the reactionmixture in 5 minutes. The reactionmixture was allowed to react for one night after which the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The residu was taken into ethylacetate and the latter solution treated with 5% aqueous NaHC03 and brine respectively. The organic layer was<br><br>
separated and dried on MgS04. Filtration of the drying agent and removal of the solvent in vacua yielded an oil which was subjected to flash column chromatography (Si02, eluent: CH2CI2/MeOH 99/1). Collection of the product containing fractions and subsequent removal of the eluent in vacuo gave an oil which crystallized upon stirring in di-isopropylether. Filtration and drying in the air gave 0,69 g (64%) of solid B2 (m.p.: 184-6 °C),<br>
Note: The applied methyl-2-adamantyl amine can easily be prepared by standard reductive amination procedures starting from 2-adamantanon and methylamine hydrochloride while using NaBH(OAc)3 as the reductive agent.<br>
The compounds of Table B have been prepared in the same manner:<br><br>
Note: The needed intermediate after step ii (scheme B.1) in the case of B3 (R6 = Me), can be prepared analogously to steps i en ii in scheme A.1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Step i (scheme C.1):<br>
16 g (160 mmol) of succinic anhydride were dissolved in dry diethyl ether.<br>
Subsequently, 44 g (160 mmol) of II, dissolved in diethyl ether were added dropwise<br>
to the stirred succinic anhydride solution. After the addition was complete, the<br>
reaction mixture was brought to reflux temperature which was continued for one<br>
night. A precipitate had formed which was filtered, the residu was washed two times<br>
with diethyl ether. Drying on the air afforded 45.6 g (75%) of the desired intermediate.<br><br>
Step ii (scheme C. 1):<br>
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 4.5 g (12 mmol) of the intermediate of step i and 7,9 g (61 mmol, 5.1 eq.) of diisopropylethylamine were dissolved in 50 ml of dry CH2CI2, the resulting stirred solution was brought to 4 °C. Subsequently, 0.90 g (7.0 mmol) of 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benztriazole, and 4.20 g (15 mmol) of 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolin‹um hexafluorophosphate were added. Then 2.19 g (15 mmol) of 2-amino-adamantane was added to the reaction mixture which was allowed to react for one hour at room temperature.<br>
To the reaction mixture about 4 g of silica was added and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting powder was put on top of a dry column (Si02) after which elution was performed (eluent: EtOAc/petroleum ether 1/1). The part of the column containing the product was collected, and taken into MeOH. The resulting suspension was filtered, the residue washed with MeOH one time. The MeOH fractions were combined and concentrated in vacuo after which the residue was taken into CH2CI2 and the resulting solution was dried on MgS04. After removal of the drying agent and the solvent in vacuo, a solid was obtained; 2.0 g of C2 (32%), melting point 192-5 °C.<br>
Step Hi (scheme C. 1):<br>
While stirring and under a nitrogen atmosphere, 6.0 g (60 mmol) of succinic anhydride was suspended in 35 ml of toluene. Subsequently, 2.07 g (18 mmol) N-hydroxy-succinimide, 0.73 g (6 mmol) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 13.3 g (18 mmol) of dry tert. butanol and 1.82 g (18 mmol) of triethylamine were added. The reaction mixture was brought to reflux temperature and allowed to react for one night. The reaction mixture was cooled, after which EtOAc was added. The resulting solution was treated respectively with 10% citric acid (aq) and brine, after which the organic fraction was dried on MgS04. Removal of the drying agent and solvent by evaporation in vacuo yielded a brown oil. Crystallization from diethylether/hexane gave 4.4 g (42%) of the desired monoester.<br>
Step iv (scheme CD:<br>
This reaction was carried out according to the procedure described in Synthesis (2000) p1369-71. The mono tert.butyl ester of succinic acid was methylated in the 2-position by reaction with lithium diisopropyl amide and methyliodide in tetrahydrofuran at -78 °C. The isolated yield of the 2-methyl-succinic acid mono tert butyl ester amounted to 60%.<br><br>
Step v (scheme C.1):<br>
While stirring, 1.8 g (9.8 mmol) of 2-methyl-succinic acid mono tert.butyl ester (step iv) was dissolved \n 45 mi of dry CH2CI2 after which the solution was brought to 4 °C. To the latter solution, 0.9 g (6.4 mmol) of 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benztriazolet and 4.0 g (15 mmol) of 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium hexafluorophosphate were added, (Subsequent addition of 111 4.1 g (14 mmol) did not give a raise in temperature, the reaction was allowed to proceed for a night at room temperature. Ca. 3 g of silicagei (SiO2) were added to the reaction mixture after which it was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting powder was put on top of a dry column (Si02) after which elution was performed (eluent: EtOAc/petroleum ether 1/4). The part of the column containing the product was collected and taken into MeOH. The latter suspension was filtered, the residu washed one more time with MeOH, The combined MeOH fractions were concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residu taken into CH2CI2 after which it was dried on MgS04. Removal of the drying agent by filtration and solvent by evaporation in vacuo, 3 g (66%) of the desired intermediate was isolated.<br>
Step vi (scheme C.1):<br>
Hydrolysis of the tert. butyl ester of the intermediate of step v was accomplished as follows; 3 g (6.4 mmol) of the tert. butyl ester was dissolved in 30 ml of dry CH2CI2 after which 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid was added dropwise. After two hours the reaction was complete, the reactionmixture was concentrated in vacuo after which the residu dissolved in a little diethylether, was put on top of a short column (dry Si02) and eluted with diethylether. The product containing eluate was concentrated in vacuo, the residue was stirred for a night in petroleum ether. Crystals were collected by filtration, after drying on the air 2.1 g (80%) were obtained of the desired intermediate.<br>
Step vii (scheme C.1):<br>
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 2.17 g (5.3 mmol) of the intermediate of step vi and<br>
4,7 ml (27 mmol, 5.1 eq.) of diisopropylethylamine were dissolved in 25 ml of dry<br>
CH2Cl2, the resulting stirred solution was brought to 4 °C Subsequently, 0.42 g (3.1<br>
mmol) of 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benztriazole, and 1.85 g (6.6 mmol) of 2-chloro-1,3-<br>
dimethylimidazolinium hexafluorophosphate were added. Then 1,0 g (6.6 mmol) of 2-<br>
amino-adamantane was added to the reaction mixture which was allowed to react for<br>

resulting powder was put on top of a dry column (SiO2) after which elution was<br><br>
performed (eluent: EtOAc/petroleum ether 1/2). The parts of the column containing the diastereomic racemates were collected separately, and taken into MeOH. The resulting two suspensions were separately filtered, each of the the two residues washed with MeOH one time. For each diastereomic racemate the corresponding MeOH fractions were combined and concentrated in vacuo after which each residue was taken into CH2CI2 after which the two solutions were dried on MgS04, After removal of the drying agent and the solvent in vacuo, two solids, each containing one of the possible diastereomeric racemates, were obtained; 1.08 g of C8 (37%), the active racemate, melting point 238-40 °C, and 1.09 g (37%) of the other, pharmacologically inactive racemate (37%) melting point 125-30 °C.

Step iv (scheme D.1):<br>
To the stirred reaction mixture of step iii, 45 ml of dry CH2CI2 were added, and 11 ml<br>
(143 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid as well. Stirring was continued for 24 hours.<br>
The reactionmixture was concentrated in vacuo after which the residu was dissolved<br>
in a little diethylether, was put on top of a short column (dry Si02) and eluted with<br>
diethylether. The product containing eluate was concentrated in vacuo, affording 0.87<br>
g (67%, 2 steps) of the desired acid intermediate.<br>
Step v (scheme D.1):<br>
While stirring, 0.87 g (3.28 mmol) of methyl-succinic acid mono amide (step iv) was dissolved in 15 ml of dry CH2CI2 after which the solution was brought to 4 °C. To the latter solution, 0.3 g (2.2 mmol) of 1-hydroxy-7-aza™benztriazole, and 1.40 g (5.0 mmol) of 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium hexafluorophosphate were added. Subsequent addition of II 1.33 g (4.80 mmol) did not give a raise in temperature, the reaction was allowed to proceed for a night at room temperature. Ca. 3 g of silicagel (Si02) were added to the reaction mixture after which it was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting powder was put on top of a dry column (Si02) after which elution was performed (eluent: EtOAc/petroleum ether 1/1).<br>
The parts of the column containing the diastereomeric racemates were collected separately, and taken into MeOH. The resulting two suspensions were separately filtered, each of the the two residues washed with MeOH one time. For each diastereomeric racemate the corresponding MeOH fractions were combined and concentrated in vacuo after which each residue was taken into CH2CI2 after which the two solutions were dried on MgS04. After removal of the drying agent and the solvent in vacuo, two solids, each containing one of the possible diastereomeric racemates, were obtained: 0.31 g (18%) of the inactive racemate (not in table D), melting behavior: melting 9O-5°C, solidifies at 130 °C, remelting 160-5 °C, and 0.40 g (23%) of the active racemate D1, melting behavior: melting 80-2 °C, solidifies at 100 °C, remelting at 125-8 °C.<br>

Example 5<br>
The 2,3-diaryl-pyrazolidines I to X used as starting materials in the above Examples<br>
1 to 4 have been prepared as follows:<br>
Step i (scheme 1):<br>
A mixture of 16.9 ml of acetic acid and 2.3 ml of water was cooled (ice/water) after which 6.8 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was carefully added. To the cooled solution, while vigorously stirring and under a nitrogen atmosphere, 13.3 g (82 mmol) of 2-fluorophenyl hydrazine was added in portions. To the latter solution, a mixture consisting of 10.0 g (82 mmol) of 2-fluorostyrene and 2.46 g (82 mmol) of paraformaldehyde, was added portionwise while keeping the temperature below 25 °C. The reaction may accumulate for some time. Vigorously stirring was continued for one night at room temperature. While cooling, 50 ml of water were added, after which extraction took place with diethyl ether (2x). The remaining aqueous fraction was made basic with 50% NaOH (aq) and subsequently extracted with diethyl ether (2x). The latter ethereal fraction was washed with water (3x) and brine (1x), and eventually dried on MgS04. Filtration of the drying agent and removal of the solvent in vacuo, yielded 16 g (75%) of a crude siruppy oil. The oil was not purified and should be stored under a nitrogen atmosphere at -20 °C to prevent oxidation of the pyrrolidine nucleus.<br><br><br><br><br>
