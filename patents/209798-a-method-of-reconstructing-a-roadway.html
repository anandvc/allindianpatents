THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
2 4 JUN 2004<br><br>
METHOD OF UPGRADING GRAVEL AND/OR DIRT ROADS AND A COMPOSITE ROAD RESULTING THEREFROM<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to reconstructing and paving roads. More specifically, the present invention is a method for designing and building a road using in-place ground components rather than removing and replacing them.<br>
Currently, when roads are re-built, materials such as stone, dirt, and gravel are often excavated and removed. Then, aggregate base material and hot mix asphalt are brought    to the construction site, and multiple layers are placed on the cleared area. One disadvantage with such a process is that it is time consuming because it requires.two operations. In one operation, a dirt or gravel road is broken up, and the material is removed. Then, in the second<br>
operation, the aggregate and asphalt are transported to the site and placed on the excavated surfaced<br>
	Another disadvantage with such a process is than it is expensive. The traffic<br>
levels expected on a road for years into the future must be projected so that the necessary thickness and strength of road is built It is difficult to project future traffic levels and so the road may be over designed by making the road too thick. Alternatively, too weak or too narrow of a road is built, and the road must be rebuilt using this expensive process in just a<br>
    few years.<br>
Still another disadvantage with such a process is that multiple layers of pavement may need to be placed on a roadway to provide sufficient structural support for the loads to be supported by the roadway. In many circumstances, this necessitates the roadway-to be built up higher than what is safe or practical. If a sufficient thickness of asphalt is not<br>
   placed on the roadway, the road will break up quickly.<br>
In many instances, the height of the road can be raised only if the shoulders and areas beyond are raised and meet slope requirements. Also, there is often no space for widening the road because it extends beyond the existing right-of-way requiring land adjacent to the road to be purchased and causing additional expense.<br>
	In order to overcome these disadvantages, a method for designing and building<br>
a new roadway using in-place materials from the existing roadway is provided. This allows a road to be built downward instead of upward with limited additional height added.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for reconstructing a dirt or gravel roadway to create a paved roadway of desired thickness without the need to increase the height of the paved roadway beyond acceptable levels so that the road meets p     structural requirements for existing and future traffic levels without significant profile or geometric changes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for making a road that uses materials currently indie roadway so that cost savings for materials are realized<br>
and time for moving the materials is reduced.<br>
yo	According to the present invention, the foregoing and other objects are<br>
achieved by a method of stabilizing a gravel and/or dirt roadway. This method includes<br>
evaluating a roadway to determine if it is an appropriate candidate for emulsion stabilization,<br>
rotating a milling head along a roadway to break up gravel and dirt, injecting an asphalt<br>
emulsion into the broken up gravel and dirt, and mixing the emulsion with the gravel and dirt<br>
  so as to form an asphalt emulsion stabilized layer. The emulsion stabilized layer is then<br>
spread and compacted to create a paved roadway. Following this, a wearing surface or<br>
surface treatment may be applied to the emulsion stabilized layer.<br>
	Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention will be set<br>
/<br>
forth in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following, or may be learned by practice of the invention. Brief Description of Drawings<br>

Referring to FIG. 1, a gravel or dirt roadway to be paved is broadly designated by the reference numeral 10. This roadway includes a subgrade layer 12 that is comprised of naturally occurring soils and a gravel and/or dirt base layer 14 Through the method of the present invention using an apparatus 16, an emulsion stabilized layer 18 is created. 10     Apparatus 16 is a reclaimer and includes a milling head 20 with teeth 22 which break up base layer 14, and sometimes break up part of layer 12, into loose material (gravel/dirt) 24 so as to begin re-profiling roadway 10. As shown in FIG. 1, apparatus 16 travels to the right of the page. Milling head 20 is connected to a motorized unit 26 which has a wheel 28. Apparatus 16 also includes a line 30 for carrying asphalt emulsion and a line 32 for carrying water. The 15     emulsion and sometimes the water are to be sprayed onto gravel/dirt 24 through a spray bar 34, which is connected to lines 30 and 32. A mixing chamber 36, which is part of apparatus 16, keeps the gravel/dirt 24, emulsion, and water in a confined area so that they can be mixed thoroughly. Spray bar 34 extends the width of the mixing chamber 36. The bottom edge of mixing chamber 36 acts to spread the newly created emulsion stabilized layer 18. A motor 20     grader may also be used to spread layer 18. Layer 18 is then compacted to increase its density using a roller. Following this, a wearing surface or surface treatment may be placed over layer 18.<br>
The finished road is shown in FIG. 2 and is broadly designated by the reference numeral 3$. It includes subgrade layer 12, gravel/dirt base layer 14, which has been at least 25     partially incorporated into layer 18, emulsion stabilized layer 18, and wearing surface 40. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, a thin asphalt layer (not shown) may be on gravel/dirt base layer 14 before the method of the present invention is started. This layer may be comprised of hot mix, cold mix, or built-up chip seals. If this layer is about 2 inches or less, then it may be broken up along with the gravel/dirt base layer 14 and combined 30     with emulsion to form emulsion stabilized layer 18. Preferably, the broken up thin asphalt layer is about one-third or less of the emulsion stabilized layer.<br>
The method of the present invention uses a one unit type of machine. Preferably, a CAT RM-350 from Caterpillar or equivalent machine is used. This machine is a<br>
4<br><br>
self-propelled reclaimer able to fully mill the existing gravel or dirt base to the depth required, incorporate the emulsion and water, and mix the materials to produce a substantially homogeneous material. Most preferably, the machine is capable of processing not less than about 8-ft (2.4 m) wide and about 12-inches deep of roadway in each pass. Preferably, the 5    reclaimer travel speed and milling head speed shall have the capability to be adjusted independently. Also, the reclaimer preferably has a visible depth gauge to allow for determination of the depth of pulverization and mixing. Preferably, the reclaimer also has a system for adding emulsion with a full width spray bar that includes a positive displacement pump interlocked to the machine speed so that the amount of emulsion being added is 10     automatically adjusted with changes in machine speed.<br>
The asphalt emulsion in line 30 is a blend of asphalt, water, emulsifier, and possibly additives. It is liquid at ambient temperature. The specific formulation of the emnlsion can vary depending upon the properties to be achie ved. For instance, it can be formulated to set up quickly. It also can be formulated to improve the coating of the 15     gravel/dirt 24 to result in less cracking of the roadway or to improve the strength of the roadway. The type of asphalt emulsion used shall be determined by the mixture design, discussed infra. Preferably, the emulsifier is a lignon tofa reacted amine.<br>
The emulsion is added to the blend of reclaimed materials (gravel/dirt 24). Optionally, water may also be added through line 32, as it may be needed to cool the milling 20     head and to aid in the dispersion of the emulsion. Preferably, the emulsion includes about 0.5 to 10% by weight emulsifier, about 60 to 65% by weight asphalt solids, water, and optionally certain additives. The additives may be 0.5 to 10% by weight of the emulsion and may include elastomers, plastomers, other adhesion agents, and petroleum fractions. Depending on which additives are used, these additives can be added to the asphalt solids or to the emulsion 25     to make modified asphalts, including polymer modified asphalt.<br>
Preferably, the asphalt emulsion system on the reclaimer is capable of incorporating up to about 7 gallons per square yard of liquid asphalt emulsion and is able to deliver within about 0.2 percent of the target percent The liquid metering system of the reclaimer preferably has a flow meter, spray bar and nozzles, and a meter measuring the 30     forward speed of the machine in feet per minute. A water truck for supplying water to the reclaimer machine may be needed during the pulverization operation to supply additional moisture.<br>
5<br><br>
An entire process for inexpensively paving or repairing a gravel, dirt, or thinly paved asphalt road is provided- The process involves creating adequate structure through in-place stabilization of the existing roadway, thus avoiding the costly requirement of widening the road and/or slope corrections associated with adding significant structure. The asphalt 5     emulsion base stabilization method of the present invention includes reclaiming a desired width and depth of the existing gravel and/or dirt base with a reclaimer. The method of the present invention provides structure so that no more than 2 inches of surfacing is needed. Apparatus 16 grinds the existing gravel/dirt road to the required depth, adds an emulsion to the loosened gravel/dirt 24 while grinding, and spreads the gravel/dirt/emulsion mixture in<br>
10     place for further spreading and conroaction. The loosened gravel/dirt 24 is wetted and coated by the emulsion. The emulsion is mixed with gravel and/or dirt in the mixing chamber 36 to form an emulsion stabilized mixture. Additional aggregate may be added to the road before processing if needed. The emulsion stabilized mixture (bituminous material) is spread and compacted, and an emulsion stabilized layer 18 is obtained The emulsion stabilized layer 18<br>
15     is no more than about six inches thick. A road constructed according to the present invention sets up at a faster rate than when using a conventional process, allowing traffic on it sooner and allowing placement of a wearing surface or surface treatment sooner.<br>
After the emulsion stabilized layer 18 has set up, a wearing surface 40, can be placed thereon. The wearing surface may be a cold, hot, or warm mix overlay, a sealcoat, a<br>
20     chip seal, a fog seal, or other surface treatment. Preferably, the wearing surface is no more than about two inches thick.<br>
A summary of the evaluation process of the present invention is shown in FIG. 3. in order to evaluate if emulsion stabilization is the correct treatment for stabilizing a road, variables such as traffic, soil type (strength/modulus and variability), and rock base strength<br>
25     and thickness 42 must be measured. The required thickness of the road to support the traffic must be determined. The soils, existing rock base material, traffic loads, emulsion type and strength improvement must be evaluated to determine if the gravel/dirt roadway is an appropriate candidate for base stabilization. In some cases, it may not be possible to limit stabilization to no more than six inches (upper limit for the emulsion stabilized layer 18) with<br>
30     a two inch wearing surface, due to poor soil conditions and/or high traffic loads. In this case, other additives should be investigated, or other methods of rehabilitation should be considered, such as removing existing soil and replacing it with higher quality material.<br>
6<br><br>
If the required thickness of the wearing surface is two inches or less 44 after<br>
the evaluation of the base layer of the roadway, then one may proceed with construction of the<br>
wearing surface 46. If it is not less than two inches, then it must be determined if the in-place<br>
material is compatible with the asphalt emulsion 48. If it is not compatible with the asphalt<br>
5     emulsion, meaning that adequate coating and dispersion are not achieved, then the material is<br>
not appropriate for the present invention 50. If it is compatible, then the modulus at various<br>
temperatures needs to be determined 52. After the asphalt emulsion is designed, the depth of<br>
stabilization with the asphalt emulsion for a two inch wearing surface needs to be determined<br>
54.<br>
10	It next needs to be determined if six inches or less of emulsion stabilized gravel<br>
and dirt with two inches or less wearing surface can meet design requirements 56. If it cannot, then other alternatives must be evaluated or the method of the present invention cannot be used 58. If it can, then one can proceed with construction 60. thicknesses of more than about 2 inches of wearing surface may be hazardous and thus undesirable from a safety 15     standpoint.<br>
A more detailed process for evaluating the unpaved road is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
Hie first step is to evaluate the unpaved road, including traffic levels, geometrics, drainage,<br>
etc., to determine the overall viability of doing the process 62. Next, the road base is more<br>
thoroughly evaluated, preferably during spring thaw 66. This is when the most water is in the<br>
20     road base layer and subgrade layer. This is a visual evaluation. Visual analysis includes<br>
inspecting geometries, culverts, road history, drainage, and soft areas. The road structure<br>
evaluation includes testing the road with a Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) preferably<br>
each half-mile and proof-rolling as needed. Following this, it is decided whether or not the<br>
road is an appropriate candidate for the base stabilization process of the present invention 70.<br>
25	If it is an appropriate road for base stabilization, additional sampling and<br>
testing, if needed, are performed 72. Borings are taken preferably each half mile and tested for resilient modulus or R value. Testing by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) or DCP can be performed, as needed, to determine resilient modulus of more areas of the road, such as isolated areas. If the road is in good/excellent condition with isolated weak areas (Resilient 30     Modulus (RM) greater than 15,000 psi or R value (measures strength) greater than 17) 74, then it is appropriate to determine a wearing surface design. If the road is in moderate condition and variable with weak areas or weak consistent areas 76, then emulsion compatibility and design 78 must be performed to determine whether the material is a good<br>
7<br><br>
candidate for base stabilization 80. If it is, the modulus of the stabilized base must be determined 84. Following this, wearing surface design with its performance properties and resilient modulus 86 is determined. If the road is weak or extremely variable, such as containing plastic or organic soils (RM less than 5,000 psi or R value less than 8 typically) 88, 5     then emulsion compatibility and design 90 must be determined.<br>
Next, it must be determined if the material is a good candidate for base stabilization 92. If it is, the modulus of the stabilized base 84 must be determined, and then the wearing surface design including its performance properties and resilient modulus 86 is determined. Typically, the thickness of the wearing surface is about two inches 96. Next,<br>
10    recommendations for repairs must be made.<br>
A description of the base stabilization with emulsion design is shown in FIG. 5. Optimally, samples are acquired at two locations per mile for base stabilization design 100.<br>
If the Plasticity Index (PI) is less than 12 or the Sand Equivalence (SE) is greater than 30 (reference numeral 102), then initial coating analysis and preliminary<br>
15     emulsion formulations 104 are determined. Next, it is determined if the coating and<br>
dispersion achieved are within acceptable moisture limits and acceptable formulations 106. If so, a base stabilization design with emulsion is performed 108. Following this, if the design is acceptable 110, then one may proceed with designing the thickness of the road structure 112. If not, then another form of stabilization must be evaluated 114.<br>
20	If the PI is not less than 12 or the SE is not greater than 30 (reference numeral<br>
102), then it must be determined if aggregate or additives can be added to get the PI less than 12 or SE greater than 30 (reference numeral 116). Aggregate or additives shall be incorporated at rates in which they are determined to be needed. If they cannot be incorporated, then another form of stabilization must be evaluated 114. The type and quantity<br>
25     of water and asphalt emulsion used to form the emulsion stabilization layer is determined by the mixture design. The stabilization design includes providing an optimum emulsion content that is compatible with the in-place material and that retains sufficient strength in the presence of water and determining if adding aggregate is necessary for the stabilization design. Optionally, chemicals such as CaC12, lime, cement, fly ash, or combinations thereof may be<br>
30     added to the emulsion stabilized mixture. Preferably, the asphalt emulsion is formulated for optimal compatibility with the gravel and/or dirt. This allows for better coating for durability and a qviicker cure time for the emulsion stabilized layer, which allows traffic to be returned to the roadway quicker and allows a wearing surface to be place on the emulsion stabilized layer<br>
8<br><br>
quicker. The emulsion stabilized mixture, including aggregate and additives added, if any, at the recommended design shall have properties as indicated in Table 1.<br>

Next, the wearing surface mix is designed, as shown in FIG. 6. Aggregate samples are acquired for mix designs, and these samples are analyzed in the lab 120. Appropriate aggregate samples are combined with an asphalt, an emulsion, or combinations thereof to form a cold mix, warm mix, or hot mix. If the lab design of the cold mix, warm mix, or hot mix meets specification criteria for moisture susceptibility and thermal cracking 122, then additional samples are prepared to determine resilient modulus 124. The specification criteria of these samples is shown in Table 2.<br>

Nuclear density testing shall be performed on a test strip at the start of the project to establish roller patterns for maximum achievable density. All subsequent paving 5     shall be compacted to a preferred minimum of about 97% density of the test strip average density. If displacement is still occurring, rolling shall be performed until no displacement is occurring or until the rollers are walking out of the mixture. Wet density shall also be determined, preferably at a minimum about every 3500 square yards, using a properly calibrated nuclear moisture density instrument.<br>
10	Heavy construction equipment should not drive on the stabilized base until the<br>
pavement is firm and will not deform or rut After opening the road to traffic, the surface of the stabilized base shall be maintained in a condition suitable for the safe movement of traffic. This shall include the removal of unacceptable loose particles by sweeping them away with a power broom. If the reclaimed mix does not appear to be adequately mixed or homogenous,<br>
15     additional mixing passes shall be completed with a reclaimer until desired uniformity is achieved. Before placing any wearing surface on the emulsion stabilized layer, the layer should be allowed to cure until the moisture content of the mixture is reduced to 2.5% or less by dry weight of mixture or until it is deterrnined that the material is firm enough for surfacing.<br>
20	The method of the present invention is especially desirable for paving rural dirt<br>
and gravel roads that may not have hot mix plants nearby. The entire operation of incorporating aggregate, water, and emulsion, and spreading can be completed in one pass. Preferably, the process of the present invention is performed at or above about 60EF (15EC). Preferably, no fog or rain is present Preferably, there are no freezing temperatures within 48<br>
25     hours after placement of any portion of the project The life of the road created is approximately ten years, depending on traffic growth.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all the ends and objects herein above set forth together with other advantages which are obvious and inherent to the method. It will be understood that certain features and<br>
30     subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. This isconteinplated by and is with in the scope of theclaims. Since many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope<br><br><br>
