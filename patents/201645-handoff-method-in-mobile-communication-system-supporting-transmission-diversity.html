				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication systems, and in particular, to a handoff method in a mobile communication system supporting transmission diversity for a base station.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a mobile communication system, a "transmission diversity" function is generally used to multiplex a path for signals transmitted from a base station to a mobile station. This provides an increase in reliability of the received signals having the same transmission power at a receiving mobile station as at the base station. Here, the "path" refers to a physical path through which a signal can be transmitted from a transmitter to a receiver. The physical path depends on several factors, such as propagation direction of a transmission antenna, polarization of a transmission signal, location of the transmission antenna, different carrier used on a frequency axis, and different transmit time on a time axis. The path does not necessarily mean a spatial path. A term "micro transmission diversity" as used herein refers to a transmission diversity function implemented in one base station, and a term "macro transmission diversity" refers to a transmission diversity function implemented within multiple base stations. TSTD concept could understand by read Korea Patent Application Serial No. 1998-5526 which is the same assignee of this invention. There is no TSTD hand off method in the wireless communication.<br>
For simplicity, a base station having the transmission diversity function will be referred to herein as a TSTD base station, and a base station not supporting the transmission diversity function as a non-TSTD base station. Furthermore, a mobile station supporting the transmission diversity function will be referred to herein as a TSTD mobile station and a mobile station not supporting the transmission diversity function as a non-TSTD mobile station.<br><br>
By way of example, reference will now be made to a transmitter for a non-TSTD base station and a transmitter for a TSTD base station with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively, and a receiver for a TSTD mobile station with reference to FIGS, 4A and 4B, before describing a handoff operation in conjunction with FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, there is shown a block diagram of a base station transmitter for a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) mobile communication system. A channel encoder and interleaver 110 is a normal channel encoder and interleaver for increasing the reliability of the transmission signals received through a traffic channel. A multiplexer (MUX) 112 multiplexes pilot symbols, transmission power control (TPC) bits, rate information (RI) bits, and data bits output from the channel encoder and interleaver 110. A serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 114 receives an output of the multiplexer 112 and outputs odd-numbered symbols to an I (In-phase) channel and even-numbered symbols to a Q (Quadrature-phase) channel. Signal converts 116 and<br>
117	convert logic signals "0" and "V output from the S/P converter 114 to "+1" and "-1",<br>
respectively.<br>
An orthogonal code generator 128 generates an orthogonal code used for separating transmission channels in the base station. Mixers 118 and 119 multiply converted signals from the signal convertors 116 and 117 by the orthogonal code generated from the orthogonal code generator 128. A PN (Pseudo-random Noise) code generator 130 generates PN codes PNI and PNQ and provides them to a complex PN spreader 120 which multiplies outputs of the mixers<br>
118	and 119 by the PN codes PNI and PN_Q, respectively. A switch 147 is employed to provide<br>
a macro-TSTD function in a soft handoff state and intermits transmission through an antenna.<br>
In the existing transmitter, a switch for discontinuous transmission (DTX) can be used for the switch 147. Lowpass filters 122 and 123 are normal lowpass filters for limiting transmission signals to a specific bandwidth. A carrier generator 132 generates a carrier for the transmission signals and provides the carrier to a mixer 124 and a 90° phase shifter 134. The 90° phase shifter 134 shifts a phase of the carrier from the carrier generator 132 by 90°, to secure an orthogonality between the I channel and the Q channel. The mixer 124 multiplies an output of the lowpass filter<br>
-  2   -<br><br>
122 by an output of the carrier generator 132 and provides its output to an adder (or an exclusive OR gate) 126. A mixer 125 multiplies an output of the lowpass filter 123 by an output of the 90° phase shifter 134 and provides its output to the adder 126. The adder 126 adds outputs of the mixers 124 and 125, and transmits its output via the antenna.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter for a base station supporting time switched transmission diversity (TSTD). The base station includes multiple transmission antennas and multiplexes a signal path from the base station to the mobile station by switching a signal being output to the transmitter using a switch. This increases the reliability of a received signal having the same mean transmission power at the mobile station as at the base station.<br>
FIG. 4A illustrates a receiver for a TSTD mobile station, which includes a receiver structure for the non-TSTD mobile station. A mixer 212 multiplies a signal received through an antenna by an output of a carrier generator 210 including the carrier generator 132 and the 90° phase shifter 134 of FIG. 1, to convert the received signal to a baseband signal. A lowpass filter 214 lowpass-filters an output of the mixer 212. A sampler 216 samples and quantizes an output of the lowpass filter 214 to convert the lowpass-filtered analog signal to a digital signal. A time estimator 218 follows a PN code to remove a phase difference between the received signal and the PN code generated in the mobile station. The time estimator 218 controls a complex PN code generator 222 and an orthogonal code generator 224.<br>
A complex PN despreader 220 PN despreads an output of the complex PN code generator 222 and the sampler 216. A mixer 226 multiplies the PN despread signal by an output of the orthogonal code generator 224. An accumulator (or integrator) 228 accumulates outputs of the mixer 226 for a symbol duration to generate a symbol estimation value. A pilot separator 232 estimates a channel from the base station antenna to the mobile station to separates pilot signals being non-modulation signals, for reliable symbol estimation. The separated signals are applied to a channel estimator 244, which has structure for communicating with a TSTD mobile station as well as a non-TSTD mobile station. A detailed structure of the channel estimator 244 is shown by FIG. 4B.<br>
-   3   -<br><br>
In general, it can be considered that every pilot signal for the signals output from the non-TSTD base station are transmitted through the same path. In addition, it can be considered that the signals output from the same antenna of the TSTD base station are transmitted through the same path. However, it cannot be considered that the signals output from different antennas are transmitted to the mobile station via the same path. Accordingly, channel estimation should be performed independently, for the respective antennas. Furthermore, channel estimation parameters C0(m), C1(m), C2(m), ... should be varied according to a period of the pilot symbols used for estimation of the respective channels.<br>
FIG. 4B is a detailed illustration of the channel estimator 244 for a TSTD mobile station which estimates the channels using two pilot symbols transmitted through the same antenna of a base station having two transmission antennas. Therefore, the channel estimator 244 includes two cascaded buffers for storing outputs of the pilot separator 232. A selector 250 selects an output of a mixer 247 in a TSTD mode of operation, and an output of a mixer 248 in a non-TSTD mode of operation. Input parameters of the mixers 247 and 248 are fixed regardless of the operation mode because the mixers 247 and 248 are selected by the selector 250, but a parameter C0(m) of a mixer 249 should be varied according to the operation mode.<br>
Further, since the time delay for the channel estimation depends on the operation mode, a delay 236 is composed of two delays 235 and 237 having a different delay time and two selectors 234 and 238. The selectors 234 and 238 are interlocked with the selector 250. An adder 251 adds outputs of the mixers 247, 248 and 249 in the channel estimator 244. A complex conjugate block 242 complex-conjugates an output of the adder 251. A mixer 240 multiplies an output of the complex conjugate block 242 by an output of a selector 238 to synchronously demodulate data symbols. An output of the mixer 240 is applied to a combiner 260 which combines signals received via multiple paths in the case where the signals transmitted through the same transmission antenna in the base station reach the mobile station via the multiple paths.<br>
For convenience, FIG. 4A shows the structure of only a particular path, and each receiver having such a structure is called a finger. The combiner 260 adds corresponding weights to outputs<br>
-   4   -<br><br>
of the respective fingers. An output of the combiner 260 is provided to a selector 262 which performs a demultiplexing process corresponding to the multiplexing process in the transmitter. A deinterleaver and channel decoder 264 deinterleaves and decodes the signals from the selector 262 which have been encoded and interleaved by the channel encoder and interleaver 110 of FIGS. l to3.<br>
A difference between the TSTD mobile station and the non-TSTD mobile station will be described with reference to FIG. 4B. For the channel estimator of the non-TSTD mobile station, the selector 250 selects the mixer 248, disregarding the mixer 247 and the buffer 246. Further, the parameter C0(m) is fixed (or used) and the parameter C2(m) is disregarded. In addition, since the receiver for the non-TSTD mobile station needs to estimate the channel for only one antenna, the delay 236 is composed of only the delay 235 and the selectors 234 and 238 are switched to select the delay 235.<br>
The prior art soft handoff operation will now be described with reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B in the case where a soft handoff operation occurs between the non-TSTD mobile station and two non-TSTD base stations. It is understood that the handoff operation is performed within a mobile communication system utilizing the transmitter and receiver structure described above with reference to FIGS. 1-4B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, a signal exchange occurs between a non-TSTD mobile station and two non-TSTD base stations A and B; that is, when the non-TSTD mobile station travels from a non-TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent non-TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff operation, only the base station A (BS#A) transmits a signal and the mobile station receives the transmitted signal (320). During the soft handoff operation, the base stations A and B simultaneously transmit the same information and the mobile station assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted information (330). After completion of the soft handoff operation, only the base station B (BS#B) transmits a signal and the mobile station receives the transmitted signal (340).<br>
FIG. 5B illustrates a timing chart of control signals and traffic signals between the base<br>
_   5   _<br><br>
stations and the mobile station during the handoff operation shown by FIG. 5A. In step 511, the non-TSTD base station A and the non-TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the non-TSTD mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 513 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When the handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 511 and continuously communicates with the base station A.<br>
Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 515 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message (or handoff approve message) to the mobile station in step 517. Here, the mobile station can make the handoff request directly by sending a control signal, or can make the handoff request indirectly. For example, for the direct handoff request, the mobile station measures strengths of signals from the base stations adjacent thereto and sends an ID (identification) of a base station having the highest signal strength (herein, the base station A) to the base station A. However, for the indirect handoff request, the mobile station sends to the base station A not only a measured strength of a signal from the base station A but also the measured strengths of signals from the adjacent base stations having a received signal strength higher than a threshold, so as to enable the base station A to determine whether to perform the handoff to a handoff target base station (herein, the base station B) when the handoff is required.<br>
In answer to the handoff request, the base station A inquires a base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff request, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether the handoff is acceptable, in step 519. When the handoff is approved, the base station A sends a signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 521, and at the same time, the base station B also sends the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 523. The mobile station receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the<br>
-   6   -<br><br>
multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 525, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in answer to the request message and releases the channel in step 527. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. Thereafter, in step 529, the mobile station communicates with the base station B in the non-TSTD mode of operation.<br>
As described above, the soft handoff operation occurs between base stations and a mobile station without taking the TSTD function into consideration, thereby simplifying the handoff procedure. But, applying the TSTD function to the base station is advantageous in that a higher communication quality can be obtained with the same mean transmission power. However, the TSTD function increases the cost of the mobile communication system, since additional hardware is required. Therefore, in an effort to minimize cost, TSTD base stations are installed in heavy traffic areas and non-TSTD base stations are installed in light traffic areas. Accordingly, when the TSTD function is introduced to a non-TSTD base station installed in a light traffic area in an effort to increase the communication quality, a new handoff procedure is required; that is, the mobile station must be handed-off to a base station which supports the TSTD function. The present invention provides novel methods for performing handoff operations in this and other circumstances while minimizing cost and operational complexity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed between a TSTD mobile station and two TSTD base stations.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed when a TSTD mobile station travels from a non-TSTD base station to a TSTD base station.<br>

-   7    -<br><br>
can be performed between a TSTD mobile station and two non-TSTD base stations.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station to a non-TSTD base station.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed between a non-TSTD mobile station and two TSTD base stations.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed when a non-TSTD mobile station travels from a non-TSTD base station to a TSTD base station.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed between a non-TSTD mobile station and two non-TSTD base stations.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a soft handoff method which can be performed when a non-TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station to a non-TSTD base station.<br>
To achieve these and other objects, handoff methods are provided for a mobile communication system supporting transmission diversity. In one embodiment, a method is disclosed for performing a handoff operation when a non-TSTD mobile station travels from a non-TSTD base station A to an adjacent non-TSTD base station B. Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation, and the mobile station receives the transmitted signal. During the soft handoff operation, the base stations A and B alternately transmit the same data via selected antennas thereof in a macro-TSTD mode of operation, and the mobile station assigns fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted data. In this embodiment, two fingers are assigned all together. After completion of the soft handoff operation, the base station B operates in the non-TSTD mode and the mobile station also operates in the non-TSTD mode to receive data from the base station B.<br>
During the handoff operation, the non-TSTD base station A and the non-TSTD mobile<br>
-   8   -<br><br>
station communicate with each other in the non-TSTD mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station sends a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in response to the handoff request. Together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether the handoff is acceptable.<br>
Thereafter, upon entering the soft handoff state, the base station A transmits a signal in the macro-TSTD mode of operation and at the same time, the base station B also transmits the same signal in the macro-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using a combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, if the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A. The base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel. At the instant of sending the channel release request, the mobile station sends a macro-TSTD mode release request to the base station B, and the base station B sends an acknowledge message in response to the request. Upon receipt of the acknowledge message, the mobile station switches the receiving mode from the macro-TSTD mode to the non-TSTD mode and communicates with the base station B in the non-TSTD mode of operation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well known constructions or functions are not described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention. Although the invention is described herein below with reference to several embodiments supporting TSTD, it is also possible to apply the invention to mobile communication systems which do not support the transmission diversity function.<br>
-   12   -<br><br>
In a mobile communication system according to the present invention, a base station distributes user data to multiple antennas on a time-division basis to perform a transmission diversity function, and a mobile station demodulates the received diversity data using a demodulator.<br>
As noted above, the term "micro-TSTD" as used herein means that a base station having multiple antennas transmits data to a mobile station by alternating the antennas on a time-division basis. That is, the micro-TSTD refers to a normal TSTD. In addition, the term "macro-TSTD" refers to transmitting data to a mobile station using antennas of multiple base stations in a soft handoff state, by selecting a base station and then selecting the transmission antenna in the selected base station. <br>
A. Mobile Communication System<br>
Before describing the various novel methods for performing handoff operations, in accordance with the present invention, a description will be made of a transmitter and receiver of a mobile communication system in which the methods of the present inventions are implemented therein.<br>
1. Transmitter<br>
As mentioned above, FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the transmitter structure of a base station. Though unable to support the micro-TSTD, the transmitter can support the macro-TSTD by transmitting data in a DTX mode of operation in a soft handoff state according to an ON/OFF state of the selector 147. FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the transmitter structure for a base station supporting the micro-TSTD, and FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter structure for a base station supporting the macro-TSTD. The two transmitters have almost the same structure, and the sloe difference therebetween is an operating method of a selector 148 and selectors 149 and 150.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a description will now be made of the transmitter for the base station supporting the TSTD function in a CDMA mobile communication system. As mentioned above, the channel encoder and interleaver 110 is a normal channel encoder and interleaver for<br>
-   13   -<br><br>
increasing reliability of the transmission signals received through the traffic channel. The multiplexer 112 multiplexes pilot symbols, transmission power control (TPC) bits, rate information (RI) bits, and data bits output from the channel encoder and interleaver 110. The serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 114 receives the output from the multiplexer 112 and outputs odd-numbered symbols to the I channel and even-numbered symbols to the Q channel. Signal converts 116 and 117 convert logic signals "0" and "1" output from the S/P converter 114 to "+\" and "-1", respectively. The orthogonal code generator 128 generates the orthogonal code used for separating transmission channels in the base station. Mixers 118 and 119 multiply converted signals from the signal convertors 116 and 117 by the orthogonal code generated from the orthogonal code generator 128. The PN code generator 130 generates PN codes PNI and PNQ and provides them to a complex PN spreader 120 which multiplies outputs of the mixers 118 and 119 by the PN codes PNI and PNQ, respectively.<br>
In the base station transmitter of FIG. 2 which supports the micro-TSTD, a selector 148 selects the transmission antennas in the TSTD mode and transfers an output of the complex PN spreader 120 to the selected antenna. In the base station transmitter of FIG. 3 which supports the macro-TSTD, either selector 149 or 150 selects a particular transmission antenna and transmits data in the DTX mode through the selected antenna.<br>
Lowpass filters 122 (or 142) and 123 (or 143) are normal lowpass filters for limiting transmission signals to a specific bandwidth. The carrier generator 132 (or 152) generates the carrier for the transmission signals and provides the carrier to the mixer 124 (or 144) and the 90° phase shifter 134 (or 154). The 90° phase shifter 134 (or 154) shifts a phase of the carrier from the carrier generator 132 (or 152) by 90°, to secure an orthogonality between the I channel and the Q channel. The mixer 124 (or 144) multiplies an output of the lowpass filter 122 (or 142) by an output of the carrier generator 132 (or 152) and provides its output to the adder 126 (or 146). The mixer 125 (or 145) multiplies an output of the lowpass filter 123 (or 143) by the output of the 90° phase shifter 134 (or 154) and provides its output to the adder 126 (or 146). The adder 126 (or 146) adds outputs of the mixers 124 (or 144) and 125 (or 145), and transmits its output via an<br>
-   14   -<br><br>
antenna.<br>
2. Receiver<br>
As noted above, FIG. 4A illustrates a receiver for the TSTD mobile station. The mixer 212 multiplies the signal received through the antenna by the output of the carrier generator 210 including the carrier generator 132 and the 90° phase shifter 134 of FIGS. 1 through 3, to convert the received signal to the baseband signal. The lowpass filter 214 lowpass-filters the output of the mixer 212. The sampler 216 samples and quantizes the output of the lowpass filter 214 to convert the lowpass-filtered analog signal to the digital signal. The time estimator 218 follows the PN code to remove the phase difference between the received signal and the PN code generated in the mobile station. The time estimator 218 controls the complex PN code generator 222 and the orthogonal code generator 224. The complex PN despreader 220 PN despreads the output of the complex PN code generator 222 and the sampler 216.<br>
The mixer 226 multiplies the PN despread signal by the output of the orthogonal code generator 224. The accumulator (or integrator) 228 accumulates outputs of the mixer 226 for the symbol duration to generate the symbol estimation value. The pilot separator 232 estimates the channel from the base station antenna to the mobile station to separates pilot signals being non-modulation signals, forreliable symbol estimation. The separated signals are applied to the channel estimator 244, which has structure for communicating with a TSTD mobile station as well as a non-TSTD mobile station. The detailed structure of the channel estimator 244 is illustrated in a circle represented by reference numeral 230.<br>
FIG. 4B, as described above, illustrates the channel estimator 244 for the TSTD mobile station which estimates the channels using two pilot symbols transmitted through the same antenna of a base station having two transmission antennas. Therefore, the channel estimator 244 includes two cascaded buffers for storing outputs of the pilot separator 232.<br>
The selector 250 selects an output of the mixer 247 in a TSTD mode of operation, and the output of the mixer 248 in a non-TSTD mode of operation. Input parameters of the mixers 247 and 248 are fixed regardless of the operation mode because the mixers 247 ad 248 are selected by the<br>
-   15   -<br><br>
selector 250, but the parameter C0(m) of the mixer 249 should be varied according to the operation mode.<br>
Further, since the time delay for the channel estimation depends on the operation mode, the delay 236 is composed of two delays 235 and 237 having a different delay time and two selectors 234 and 238. The selectors 234 and 238 are interlocked with the selector 250. The adder 251 adds outputs of the mixers 247, 248, and 249 in the channel estimator 244. The complex conjugate block 242 complex-conjugates the output of the adder 251. The mixer 240 multiplies the output of the complex conjugate block 242 by the output of the selector 238 to synchronously demodulate data symbols. The output of the mixer 240 is applied to the combiner 260 which combines signals received via multiple paths in the case where the signals transmitted through the same transmission antenna in the base station reach the mobile station via the multiple paths.<br>
As mentioned above, FIG. 4A shows the structure of only a particular path, and each receiver having such a structure is called a finger. The combiner 260 adds corresponding weights to outputs of the fingers. The output of the combiner 260 is provided to the selector 262 which performs a demultiplexing process corresponding to the multiplexing process in the transmitter. The deinterleaver and channel decoder 264 deinterleaves and decodes the signals from the selector 262 which have been encoded and interleaved in the channel encoder and interleaver 110 of FIGS. 1 to 3.<br>
Code outputs from the orthogonal code generator 224 and the complex PN code generator 222 in the finger receiving signals from the same micro-TSTD base station, are equal to each other, though they are different from each other in phase. However, outputs of the orthogonal code generator 224 and the complex PN code generator 222 in the finger receiving signals from different macro-TSTD base stations, may be different from each other in phase and in code.<br>
Now, various embodiments of the present invention will be described as implemented within the above-described structures for the transmitter and receiver in the mobile communication system. B. First Embodiment<br>
-   16   -<br><br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B are diagrams illustrating a soft handoff method according to a first embodiment of the present invention. With respect to FIG. 6A, a signal exchange occurring when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation by alternating the transmission antennas BS#A1 and BS#A2 (310). Prior to executing the handoff procedure, the base station A switches the operation mode from the TSTD mode to the non-TSTD mode to transmit a signal via one of the antennas, and the mobile station receives the transmitted signal (320).<br>
In the non-TSTD mode, the base station selects one of the transmission antennas to transmit a signal according to an antenna select message that the mobile station has transmitted based on a quality (i.e., strength) of a received signal. During the soft handoff, the base stations A and B simultaneously transmit the same information in the non-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted information (330).<br>
Here, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B entirely depends on a judgement of the base station B itself, because the mobile station has not received a signal transmitted in the TSTD mode from the base station B and thus cannot determine which transmission antenna of the base station B has a better transmission quality. Therefore, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B is determined by the base station B itself depending on the total transmission powers to the respective antennas. Immediately after the soft handoff, only the base station B transmits a signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station receives the transmitted signal (340). After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station also receives the transmitted signal in the TSTD mode of operation (350).<br>
FIG. 6B illustrates a flow diagram of control signals and traffic signals between the base stations and the mobile station during the handoff process of FIG. 6A. In step 611, the TSTD base station A and the TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of<br>
-    17    -<br><br>
operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 613 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoffis not required, the mobile station returns to step 611 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 615 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message (or handoff approve message) to the mobile station in step 617.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires a base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 619. When handoff is approved, the base station A sends a signal via the transmission antenna selected by the mobile station in the non-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station receives the signal transmitted from the base station A in the non-TSTD mode of operation, in step 621.<br>
Thereafter, upon entering the soft handoff state, the base station A sends a signal in the non-TSTD mode in step 623 and at the same time, the base station B also sends the same signal in the non-TSTD mode in step 625. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 627, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 629. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A.<br>
-   18   -<br><br>
Thereafter, in step 631, the mobile station communicates with the base station B in the non-TSTD mode of operation. Meanwhile, in step 633, the mobile station requests the base station B to send a signal in the TSTD mode of operation, and the base station B then sends a confirm message (or acknowledge message) to the mobile station in step 635. Subsequently, the mobile station and the base station B communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 637.<br>
 C. Second Embodiment<br>
FIGS. 7A and 7B are diagrams illustrating a soft handoff method according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7A, a signal exchange occurring when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation by alternating the transmission antennas BS#A1 and BS#A2 (310). During the soft handoff, the base stations A and B simultaneously transmit the same information in the non-TSTD mode of operation, and the mobile station assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted information (330).<br>
Here, the base station A selects one of the transmission antennas to transmit a signal according to an antenna select message that the mobile station has transmitted based on a quality (i.e., strength) of a received signal. However, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B entirely depends on a judgement of the base station B itself, because the mobile station has not received a signal transmitted in the TSTD mode from the base station B and thus cannot determine which transmission antenna of the base station B has the higher transmission quality. Therefore, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B is determined by the base station B itself depending on the total transmission powers to the respective antennas. After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station also receives the transmitted signal in the TSTD mode of operation (350).<br>
-   19   -<br><br>
FIG. 7B illustrates a flow diagram of control signals and traffic signals between the base stations and the mobile station during the handoff process of FIG. 7A. In step 711, the TSTD base station A and the TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 713 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 711 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 715 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in step 717.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 719.<br>
Thereafter, upon entering the soft handoff state, the base station A sends a signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 721 and at the same time, the base station B also sends the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 723. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 725, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 727. At the same time, the mobile station also<br>
-   20   -<br><br>
discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. At the instant of sending the channel release request message, the mobile station requests the base station B to send a signal in the TSTD mode of operation in step 729, and the base station B then sends a confirm message to the mobile station and subsequently, transmits data in the TSTD mode in step 731. Upon receipt of the confirm message, the mobile station switches the operation mode from the non-TSTD mode to the TSTD mode and communicates with the base station B in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 733.<br>
 P. Third Embodiment<br>
FIGS. 8A and 8B are diagrams illustrating a soft handoff method according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 8A, a signal exchange occurring when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation by alternating the transmission antennas BS#A1 and BS#A2 (310). During the soft handoff, the base stations A and B intermittently transmit data in the macro-TSTD mode of operation via selected ones of the transmission antennas thereof, and the mobile station assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted data (360).<br>
Here, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B entirely depends on a judgement of the base station B itself, because the mobile station has not received a signal transmitted in the TSTD mode from the base station B and thus cannot determine which transmission antenna of the base station B has the higher transmission quality. Therefore, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B is determined by the base station B itself depending on the total transmission powers to the respective antennas. After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station also receives the transmitted signal in the TSTD mode of operation (350).<br>
FIG. 8B illustrates a flow diagram of control signals and traffic signals between the base stations and the mobile station during the handoff process of FIG. 8A. In step 811, the TSTD base<br>
-   21   -<br><br>
station A and the TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 813 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 811 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 815 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in step 817.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 819. Upon entering the soft handoff state through steps 817 and 819, the base stations A and B alternately send the signal in the macro-TSTD mode of operation in steps 821 and 823. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 825, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 827. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. At the instant of sending the channel release request message, the mobile station requests the base station B to send a signal in the TSTD mode of operation in step 829, and the base station B then sends a confirm message to the mobile station and subsequently, switches the operation mode to the TSTD mode in step 831.<br>
-   22   -<br><br>
Upon receipt of the confirm message, the mobile station switches the operation mode from the non-TSTD mode to the TSTD mode and communicates with the base station B in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 833. E. Fourth Embodiment<br>
FIGS. 9A and 9B are diagrams illustrating a soft handoff method according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9A, a signal exchange occurring when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation by alternating the transmission antennas BS#A1 and BS#A2 (310). During the soft handoff, the base stations A and B simultaneously transmit the same data in the micro-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted data (370). In this embodiment, four fingers are assigned all together. After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station also receives the transmitted signal in the TSTD mode of operation (350).<br>
FIG. 9B illustrates a flow diagram of control signals and traffic signals between the base stations and the mobile station during the handoff process of FIG. 9A. In step 911, the TSTD base station A and the TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 913 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 911 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 915 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in step 917.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff<br>
-   23   -<br><br>
request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 919. Upon entering the soft handoff state through step 917, the base station A sends a signal in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 921 and the base station B also sends the same signal in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 923. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 925, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 927. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. Thereafter, in step 929, the mobile station and the base station B communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of operation.<br>
The fourth embodiment can be applied even to a handoff for a sync channel. In a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), each frame is 10ms and is composed of 16 time slots. In the sync channel, one time slot is divided into 10 durations, to output first and second sync codes for 256-chip period in a first duration of each slot. Here, a channel for transmitting the first sync code in the first duration of each slot is referred to as a first sync channel, and a channel for transmitting the second sync code in the first duration of each slot is referred to as a second sync channel. As in the fourth embodiment, prior to performing the handoff for the sync channel, the mobile station receives a sync channel transmitted in the TSTD mode of operation from the base station A. During the handoff, the mobile station receives both a sync channel transmitted in the TSTD mode of operation from the base station A and a sync channel transmitted in the TSTD mode of operation from the base station B. After completion of the handoff, the mobile station<br>
-    24    -<br><br>
receives a sync channel transmitted in the TSTD mode of operation from the base station B.<br>
F. Fifth Embodiment<br>
FIGS. 10A and 10B are diagrams illustrating a soft handoff method according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 10A, a signal exchange occurring when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation by alternating the transmission antennas BS#A1 and BS#A2 (310). During the soft handoff, the base station A continuously transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation and at the same time, the base station B transmits the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station then assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted signals (380). In this embodiment, three fingers are assigned all together.<br>
Here, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B entirely depends on a judgement of the base station B itself, because the mobile station has not received a signal transmitted in the TSTD mode from the base station B and thus cannot determine which transmission antenna of the base station B has the higher transmission quality. Therefore, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B is determined by the base station B itself depending on the total transmission powers to the respective antennas. After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station also receives the transmitted signal in the TSTD mode of operation (350).<br>
FIG. 10B illustrates a flow diagram of control signals and traffic signals between the base stations and the mobile station during the handoff process of FIG. 10A. In step 1011, the TSTD base station A and the TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 1013 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 1011<br>
-   25   -<br><br>
and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 1015 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message in response to the handoff request in step 1017.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 1019.<br>
Thereafter, upon entering the soft handoff state, the base station A sends a signal in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 1021 and at the same time, the base station B sends the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 1023.

G. Sixth Embodiment<br>
FIGS. 11A and 11B are diagrams illustrating a soft handoff method according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11A, a signal exchange occurring when a TSTD mobile station travels from a TSTD base station A (BS#A) to an adjacent TSTD base station B (BS#B). Immediately before the soft handoff, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation by alternating the transmission antennas BS#A1 and BS#A2 (310). At the beginning of the soft handoff procedure, the base station A transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation and at the same time, the base station B transmits the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station then assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted signals (380).<br>
Here, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B entirely depends on a judgement of the base station B itself, because the mobile station has not received a signal transmitted in the TSTD mode from the base station B and thus cannot determine which transmission antenna of the base station B has the higher transmission quality. Therefore, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B is determined by the base station B itself depending on the total transmission powers to the respective antennas. During the soft handoff, the base stations A and B simultaneously transmit the same data in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station then assigns the fingers to the transmission paths from the respective base stations to receive the transmitted data (370). In this embodiment, four fingers are assigned all together. After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B transmits a signal in the TSTD mode of operation. The mobile station also receives the transmitted signal in the TSTD mode of operation (350).<br>
FIG. 11B illustrates a flow diagram of control signals and traffic signals between the base stations and the mobile station during the handoff process of FIG. 11A. In step 1111, the TSTD base station A and the TSTD mobile station communicate with each other in the micro-TSTD<br>
-   27   -<br><br>
mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 1113 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 1111 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 1115 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message in response to the handoff request in step 1117.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 1119. When handoff is approved through steps 1117 and 1119, the base station A continuously transmits a signal in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 1121 and at the same time, the base station B transmits the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 1123. Meanwhile, the mobile station requests the base station B to send a signal in the TSTD mode of operation in step 1125, and the base station B then sends a confirm message to the mobile station in step 1127. Upon receipt of the confirm message, the mobile station switches the operation mode from the non-TSTD mode to the TSTD mode to receive the signal transmitted from the base station B.<br>
Thereafter, upon entering the regular soft handoff state, the base station A sends a signal in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 1129 and at the same time, the base station B also sends the same signal in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 1131. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
-   28   -<br><br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 1133, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 1135. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. Thereafter, the mobile station communicates with the base station B in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 1137. <br>

In this embodiment, two fingers are assigned all together.<br>
Here, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B entirely depends on a judgement of the base station B itself, because the mobile station has not received a signal transmitted in the TSTD mode from the base station B and thus cannot determine which transmission antenna of the base station B has the higher transmission quality. Therefore, selection of the transmission antennas in the base station B is determined by the base station B itself depending on the total transmission powers to the respective antennas. Immediately after the soft handoff, only the base station B transmits a signal and the mobile station then receives the transmitted signal (340). After completion of the soft handoff, the base station B operates in the TSTD mode and the mobile station also operates in the TSTD mode to receive data from the base station B (350).<br>

The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in response to the handoff request in step 1217.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 1219.<br>

The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 1225, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 1227. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. After completion of the soft handoff,<br>

Meanwhile, the mobile station requests the base station B to send a signal in the TSTD mode of operation in step 1231, and the base station B then sends a confirm message to the mobile station and operates in the TSTD mode in step 1233. Upon receipt of the confirm message, the mobile station switches the operation mode from the non-TSTD mode to the TSTD mode and communicates with the base station B in the micro-TSTD mode of operation in step 1235.

-   31   -<br><br>
mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 1313 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 1311 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 1315 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in response to the handoff request in step 1317.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends information about the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A.

The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 1325, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 1327. At the same time, the mobile station also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A.<br>

-   40   -<br><br>
mode of operation. During the communication, the mobile station examines in step 1813 whether a receiving strength of a signal from the base station A is lower than a threshold to determine whether handoff is required. When handoff is not required, the mobile station returns to step 1811 and continuously communicates with the base station A. Otherwise, when handoff is required, the mobile station proceeds to step 1815 to send a handoff request to the base station A. The base station A then sends a handoff confirm message to the mobile station in response to the handoff request in step 1817.<br>
Here, together with the handoff request, the mobile station sends informationabout the handoff target base station B and information about a transmission antenna, selected for the non-TSTD mode, out of the transmission antennas of the base station A. Upon receipt of the handoff request, the base station A inquires the base station controller (BSC) as to whether the base station B can accept the handoff, and sends the inquiry result to the mobile station. At the same moment, the base station B can also send the mobile station information as to whether handoff is acceptable, in step 1819. When handoff is approved, the base station A transmits a signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 1821 and the mobile station receives the signal transmitted form the base station A in the non-TSTD mode of operation.<br>
Thereafter, upon entering the soft handoff state, the base station A transmits a signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 1823 and at the same time, the base station B also transmits the same signal in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 1825. The mobile station then receives the transmitted signals by assigning the fingers for the signals from the respective base stations, multiplies the received signals by the weights corresponding to qualities of the signals from the respective base stations using the combiner and accumulates the multiplied values, to thereby perform the soft handoff operation.<br>
In the meantime, when the quality of a signal from the base station A decreases below a threshold, the mobile station sends a release request message for a channel connected to the base station A in step 1827, and the base station A then sends an acknowledge message in response to the request message and releases the channel in step 1829. At the same time, the mobile station<br>
-   41   -<br><br>
also discontinues receiving a signal from the base station A. Thereafter, the mobile station communicates with the base station B in the non-TSTD mode of operation in step 1831. Q. Fourteenth Embodiment<br>
