				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a mobile radio<br>
system and to a mobile station which are suitable for<br>
carrying out transmission/reception operation in the<br>
duplex and semiduplex mode.<br>
Previous mobile radio systems operating in the<br>
duplex mode operate at specific uplink and downlink<br>
frequencies, with each mobile station needing to have a<br>
direct link to a base station. In this case, signals<br>
between two mobile stations are not transmitted<br>
directly from one mobile station to the other, but via<br>
one or more base stations depending on the location of<br>
the mobile stations. If there is no link from the<br>
mobile stations to a base station, no link can be set<br>
up to another mobile station. Such a situation is shown<br>
in Figure 4. Although, as shown in Figure A, the mobile<br>
station A can set up a link to the base station, the<br>
mobile station B cannot, since it is out of range of<br>
the base station (for example in a valley or on a<br>
bridge) . No link can therefore be set up between the<br>
mobile stations A and B even if, for example, there is<br>
a visual link between them. Since it has so far not<br>
been possible, to overcome this disadvantage with mobile<br>
radio systems operating in the duplex mode, additional<br>
systems such as TETRA (Trans European Trunked Radio<br>
Access) have been developed and constructed, in which<br>
communication takes place directly between two mobile<br>
radios, without using a base station. However, a mobile<br>
radio system operating in the duplex mode is<br>
advantageous for effective use of the available<br>
frequencies and base stations.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to<br>
provide a mobile radio system and a mobile station<br>
which, in addition<br>
to transmission/reception operation in the duplex mode,<br>
are also suitable for transmission/reception operation<br>
in the non-duplex mode.<br>
The object is achieved by the features of the<br>
independent claims.<br>
Accordingly, a mobile radio system having a<br>
number of mobile stations is provided, in which the<br>
mobile stations have means for carrying out<br>
transmission/reception operation in the duplex mode and<br>
in the semiduplex mode. The mobile stations are thus<br>
suitable for setting up communication to one or more<br>
mobile stations using the duplex and/or semiduplex<br>
mode.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a first mobile station contains means for<br>
carrying out transmission/reception operation with a<br>
base station in the duplex mode, and with a second<br>
mobile station in the semiduplex mode, thus allowing<br>
simultaneous communication to be set up from the first<br>
mobile station in the duplex mode to the base station<br>
and to a second mobile station in the semiduplex mode,<br>
even when there is no link from the second mobile<br>
station to the base station-<br>
Furthermore, means are provided for carrying<br>
out transmission/reception operation with the base<br>
station in the duplex mode and with the second mobile<br>
station in the semiduplex mode, in such a manner that<br>
the transmission/reception operation is carried out<br>
cyclically in timeslots, and the timeslots for the<br>
duplex and semiduplex mode run synchronously with<br>
respect to one another. The timeslots for the duplex<br>
and semiduplex mode can thus be superimposed<br>
(interleaved) in such a manner that the transmission/<br>
reception operation is carried out virtually<br>
simultaneously in the duplex and semidupiex mode<br>
without any mutual influence.<br>
If the first mobile station is provided with<br>
means for carrying out transmission/reception operation<br>
with the base station in the duplex mode and with the<br>
second mobile station in the semidupiex mode, in such a<br>
manner that signals from the base station are<br>
transmitted via the first mobile station to the second<br>
mobile station and vice versa, communication can be set<br>
up between the base station and the second mobile<br>
station with the interposition of the first mobile<br>
station as a repeater, even when there is no direct<br>
link from the second mobile station to the base<br>
station.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the<br>
first mobile station contains means for carrying out<br>
transmission/reception operation with the second mobile<br>
station and with a third mobile station in the<br>
semidupiex mode, thus allowing simultaneous<br>
communication to be set up directly from the first<br>
mobile station to the second and third mobile station<br>
in the semidupiex mode without any link to a base<br>
station.<br>
. If the first mobile station is provided with<br>
means for carrying out transmission/reception operation<br>
with the second and the third mobile station in the<br>
semidupiex mode, in such a manner that signals from the<br>
second mobile station are transmitted via the one<br>
mobile station to the third mobile station and vice<br>
versa, communication can be set up between the second<br>
and third mobile station with the interposition of the<br>
one mobile station as a repeater even when there is no<br>
link between the second and third mobile station and<br>
any base station.<br>
If a number of mobile stations are coupled to<br>
one another, then a communication chain or<br>
communication network of any desired size can be<br>
produced, in which case communication can be set up via<br>
a number of mobile stations with or without using base<br>
stations.<br>
In order to avoid loading the power supply<br>
device of the first mobile station in an uncontrolled<br>
manner, the first mobile station is equipped with means<br>
for manually or automatically switching on and off the<br>
transmission of signals from the second mobile station<br>
via the first mobile station to the base station or to<br>
the third mobile station, and vice versa. The function<br>
of the first mobile station as a repeater can thus be<br>
activated or deactivated.<br>
The present invention will be explained in the<br>
following description with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figures 1 to 3 show various embodiments and<br>
operating modes of a mobile radio system according to<br>
the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows a mobile radio system according<br>
to the prior art;<br>
Figure 5 shows an illustration of frequency<br>
bands to be used; and<br>
Figure 6 shows an illustration of timeslots to<br>
be used.<br>
Conventional mobile radio systems, such as the<br>
GSM system, operate in the duplex mode and generally<br>
using a timeslot method in. which the transmitter and<br>
receiver are active at different times. The transmitter<br>
in this case operates in the uplink frequency band,<br>
while the receiver operates in the downlink frequency<br>
band.<br>
In the present invention, a semiduplex band is<br>
required as an additional band. As shown in Figure 5a,<br>
such a band may lie in another frequency band or, as<br>
shown in figure 5b, may be arranged such that it is<br>
superimposed on the uplink and downlink frequencies.<br>
Figure 6 shows a transmission/reception process<br>
within a transmission/reception cycle which is<br>
subdivided into eight timeslots (0 to 7) . The<br>
semiduplex band (see Figure 6a) allows transmission and<br>
reception at the same frequency, with transmission and<br>
reception each being carried out in different<br>
timeslots. The reference symbol RXs in this case<br>
denotes reception, and TXs transmission of signals in<br>
the semiduplex band. The semiduplex band timeslots are<br>
synchronized to the duplex band timeslots (see Figure<br>
6b) as in the GSM system, but they may differ in the<br>
nature of the transmission, and in length. The<br>
reference symbol RX denotes reception and TX<br>
transmission of signals in the duplex band. Overall,<br>
this means that it is possible to work virtually<br>
simultaneously in both bands (see Figure 6c).<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a mobile station A<br>
communicates with the base station using the duplex<br>
mode. In addition, the mobile station A can set up<br>
communication using the semiduplex mode with the mobile<br>
station B. There is no link between the mobile station<br>
B and the base station. It is thus possible for the<br>
mobile station A to communicate simultaneously with the<br>
base station and the mobile station B.<br>
Figure 2 shows a situation in which the mobile<br>
station A is being used as a repeater. As in the<br>
situation shown in Figure 1, there is a direct link<br>
between the base station and the mobile station A,<br>
while there is no direct link between the base station<br>
and the mobile station B. However, the mobile station A<br>
converts the semiduplex mode information transmission<br>
to duplex mode information transmission, and vice<br>
versa, so that communication is set up between the base<br>
station and the mobile station B. This means that data<br>
are transmitted using the semiduplex mode from the<br>
mobile station B to the mobile station A, are processed<br>
in the mobile station A and are passed on using the<br>
duplex mode to the base station and, in the opposite<br>
direction, are transmitted from the base station to the<br>
mobile station A using the duplex mode, are<br>
processed in the mobile station A, and are passed on to<br>
the mobile station B using the semiduplex mode.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, it is likewise possible<br>
for the mobile station A to communicate simultaneously<br>
with the mobile station B and the mobile station C<br>
using the semiduplex mode or, as a repeater, to receive<br>
information in the semiduplex mode from the mobile<br>
station B, and to pass it on to the other mobile<br>
station C using the semiduplex mode (or vice versa) .<br>
Direct coupling between the mobile stations B and G<br>
would be impossible since the mobile station B is<br>
located in an area (valley) which is shadowed from the<br>
mobile station C.<br>
It is also possible to form a chain comprising<br>
a greater number of mobile stations.<br>
The mobile stations have a control device which<br>
chooses between operation with one or two further<br>
stations or else operation as a repeater. If required,<br>
the control device may automatically select operation<br>
as a repeater. However, in order to avoid loading the<br>
power supply device in a mobile station in an<br>
uncontrolled manner, operation as a repeater can be<br>
inhibited.<br>
The advantage of the mobile radio system in the<br>
present invention, in which mobile stations can be<br>
operated as repeaters, is, as described above, that<br>
even mobile stations which have no direct link to a<br>
base station due to shadowing can set up communication<br>
to other mobile stations and to the base station. A<br>
further advantage is that a mobile station can likewise<br>
be operated from an aircraft. In a conventional mobile<br>
radio system, operation of a mobile station from an<br>
aircraft -while flying is normally impossible since the<br>
mobile station cannot set up communication with a<br>
specific base station from the large number of<br>
accessible base stations. By using<br>
mobile stations as repeaters which operate at a<br>
frequency suitable for them, however, it is possible to<br>
set up communication with one base station.<br>
Furthermore, the mobile radio system in the<br>
present invention can be designed to be self-<br>
organizing. By using new transmission methods such as<br>
JD-CMDA, it can provide very high transmission<br>
capacities. Such a combined system makes it possible to<br>
integrate virtually all the radio and mobile<br>
requirements which arise and operate with limited range<br>
and, possibly, with high traffic densities: wireless<br>
LAN, DSSR "digital short range radio, LPD low power<br>
devices, TETRA trunked mobile radio and BOS, railroad<br>
radio, cordless telephones, mobile telephones, aviation<br>
radio, maritime radio, emergency paging systems and<br>
cordless buses (for control functions) .<br>
In one design variant of the invention, the<br>
term duplex mode means a frequency division duplex<br>
(FDD) mode, and the term semiduplex mode means a time<br>
division duplex (TDD) mode. In this case, different<br>
frequency bands can be provided for the uplink (mobile<br>
station to base station) for FDD (Frequency Division<br>
Duplex) systems, such as the GSM system or UTRA (UMTS<br>
(Universial Mobile Telephony System) Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access) FDD mode than for the downlink (base station to<br>
mobile station), and different time periods can be<br>
provided for the uplink and downlink for TDD (Time<br>
Division Duplex) systems such as DECT (Digital Enhanced<br>
Cordless Telecommunications) system or the UTA (UMTS<br>
(Universial Mobile Telephony System) Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access) TDD mode.<br>
