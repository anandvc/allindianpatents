This invention relates to a pressure cooker or a pressure sterilizer. More particularly this invention relates to an additional safety device which would prevent an accidental explosion of the pressure cooker or pressure sterilizer.<br>
The invention is aimed principally at and would be described with reference to pressure cookers, ^ But it can also be applied to pressure sterilizers, the vent weight or a spring biased safety valve for' letting out excess steam within the cooker can get stuck. The fusible alloy pellet safety valve can also fail in  some cases particularly when it is a spurious one. Pressure cooker explosions do occur causing injury to the operator. It is against this background that in-built safety devices have been thought of and proposed by many. Thus Indian Patent No.149522 proposes a gasket release system (GRS) for the lid outside the body type of pressure cookers. The value of this GRS has been well recognised and the invention adopted by several manufacturers. But a not so well recognised defect of these lid outside the body type of pressure cookers with a GRS is that leaks are frequent at the safety slot on the lid during the routine working of the appliance (with the weight valve functioning adequately) especially with an aging gasket as the gasket is not supported adequately at the slot. But the safety feature is of supreme importance and this has avoided many a pressure cooker explosion in these<br>
lid outside the body type of pressure cookers. The GRS is however not available for the lid inside the body type of pressure cookers.<br><br>
A safety feature related to such a narrow ring as the gasket may not function 9.  properly at the crucial moment. The allowable width of the gasket and consequently of the slot on the lid is a limiting factor for pressure release  mechanisms related to the gasket and this severely limits its use particularly for the lid inside the body type of pressure cookers. As such the need is felt for an extra safety device which does not predispose to leaks during the routine functioning of the cooker but which becomes operative when the pressure reaches dangerous levels. Certain pressure cookers of the prior art do have a small hole on their lid fitted with a rubber disc cap having a biflanged edge which engages on to the edge of the said hole on the lid. The centre of this rubber disc cap is provided with a fusible alloy pellet. In case the alloy pellet does not melt the rubber disc cap would be ejected out of the lid when the pressure reaches dangerous levels. Besides the possibility of leakage at the edges of the rubber disc cap during routine working, the main defect of this existing safety valve is that the size of the hole on the lid of the cooker cannot be increased as the rubber disc cap would then be ejected out during the routine working of the cooker. Such a small rubber cap sealing a small hole may not be ejected out at the critical moment and the failed ejection mm  mechanism may predispose to an explosion. The object of this invention is to propose a pressure release mechanism independent of the gasket, which does not predispose to leaks during the routine working of the cooker but becomes unfailingly operative when the pressure reaches dangerous levels, which can be put into practice economically<br><br>
and which can be  applied to both the  lid outside and   lid  inside the  body type of  pressure cookers.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a  pressure cooker  or<br>
a pressure sterilizer hereinafter referred to as   'the cooker*<br>
comprising a vessel and  a  lid with means provided for  sealingly<br>
fitting the said   lid on to the mouth of the vessel through a gasket<br>
and a safety valve for   letting out the steam as and when the x<br>
pressure goes above a predetermined value characterised  in that<br>
	or<br>
said vessel above and away from its base or the said   lid  is<br>
provided with an opening and means are  provided for  sealingly<br>
fitting a resilient  plate made of a material such as<br>
rubber  over the said  opening,   said means comprises a cap with means<br>
provided for  applying said cap against the said  opening on the<br>
cooker  so as to hold the said  plate  between the  cap and  the<br>
*<br>
cooker against the said opening on the cooker, said cap capable of being applied against the said plate towards the periphery of the latter on to the edges of said opening on the cooker in the fitted position of the cap and the plate on the cooker so as to provide a leak proof fitting, and means provided for the said plate to communicate with the interior of the cooker and with the exterior (at least potentially) through the body wall of the cooker.<br>
The means of communication of the resilient plate with<br>
the interior or exterior of the cooker is as follows: The<br><br>
base of the cap   (applied  over or under the resilient  plate  )    <br><br>
is provied with an opening and/or the base of the said cap is <br>
spacedly positioned from the said plate and means are provided for  the space between the cap and the plate to communicate with the interior of the cooker   (when the cap is fitted  internally),  or with the exterior,  at  least  potentially, when the cap is fitted externally.   In the preferred  embodiments the body of the cooker towards its top or the  said   lid of the cooker is  provided with an outwardly or inwardly extending tubular  projection so as to hold the said  plate  between the said  cap and the said tubular projection.  From the manufacturing point of view it  is economical if the  lid  of the cooker  is provided with an opening and  an externally threaded tubular  bolt with an outward flange towards its one end  and an internally threaded nut dimensioned to be fitted  over the said tubular  bolt so as to grip the  lid  of the cooker in between at the edges of<br>
said opening on the said   lid  is also provided.  A cap with a base<br><br>
 and  an internally threaded skirt extending from the base, said  skirt of the cap being dimensioned to fit  against the said externally threaded tubular  bolt would hold the said  plate between the cap and the  said tubular  bolt. The base of the cap may be provided with a central opening exposing internally or externally the central part  of the plate through the said  opening. Alternatively the  base of the cap is spaced ly positioned from the said  plate,   said  skirt having an inwardly extending step dimensioned to fit over the peripheral edge of the said  plate all<br><br>
around,  the space between the said cap and the said  plate communi-<br>
eating with the interior or exterior of the cooker through  an<br>
opening provided on the  said cap.  The preferred form of the said<br>
plate 	a rubber<br>
disc and this may  be made of the same material that goes into the making of the gasket of the cooker.<br>
The Invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: Fig.1:  is the sectional elevation of the part  of the  lid   of<br>
the cooker  provided with one  embodiment  of the extra <br>
safety valve according to the invention; Fig.2:  is the sectional elevation of the part of the  lid of<br>
the cooker  provided with another  embodiment  of the extra<br>
safety valve according to the invention; Fig,3:  is the sectional elevation of the part of the<br>
lid of the cooker  provided with another  embodiment  of the<br>
extra safety valve according to the invention.<br>
As shown in the figures,  the  lid  L of the pressure cooker<br>
is provided with an opening.  An externally threaded tubular  bolt<br>
B with an outward flange F towards its  bottom and  an internally<br>
threaded JocfafiiiaKxfcaE    nut  N dimensioned to be fitted  over the said<br>
externally threaded tubular  bolt  so as to grip the  lid  of the cooker<br>
of the<br>
in between at the edges^ttia said  opening on the said   lid  L is provided.  A metal cap C with a  base and  an internally threaded  skirt<br><br>
extending downwards from the  base,   said  skirt  being dimensioned to fit  against the said  externally threaded  bolt  is also provided, said  base  of the  cap C  being  provided with an opening P. The tubular   bolt  B has an  inwardly extending annular projection defining a mouth M against which the rubber is  placed. The rubber disk K     may be made of the same type of heat  stable rubber which goes into the making of the rubber gasket of pressure cookers.   In the embodiment  shown in Fig. 1/ the rubber disk K is pressed all around its periphery by the holed  base of the cap C when the cap is fitted on to the tubular  bolt thus providing a  leak proof fitting. The central<br><br>
through the opening P on the metal cap C and with the exterior<br>
through the opening M on the tubular bolt. An additional press<br>
be<br>
fitting cap may be. provided for fitting on the opening P (when the cap<br>
C is fitted externally) or on the opening M (when the cap C is<br>
fitted internally) , M and P being the external openings exposing<br>
the rubber plate.<br><br>
In the routine working of the pressure cooker the steam pushes the'rubber disc  outwards,   but the steam pressure would not  be sufficient to rupture the stretched disc. There is thus no risk of  leakage at this extra safety valve during the routine  working of the cooker  as the disc can be well pressed all around.  But when the pressure reaches dangerous  levels, the rubber disc ruptures to  let  out the steam and the steam escapes out through the openings M and P.  A new rubber disc is  inserted once the old one has ruptured and the cooker used  again.  In cases where the openings P or M are closed  externally by a press fitting cap, this cap is ejected out  by the excess pressure of steam. The size of the opening on the lid of the cooker and  of the mouth M,  and the sixe of the opening or of the raised portion on the base of the said cap C,  and the area and thickness of the rubber disc K can be suitably adjusted so thst the disc can withstand the ordinary workiag pressures of the pressure cooker  but would give way when the pressure reaches dangerous  levels. The  cap C also performs the aesthetic function of concealing Idwt the rubber disc from the operator. For most  ordinary cookers the rubber disc is exposed for an area of at   least  2 sq.cm.<br><br><br><br>
