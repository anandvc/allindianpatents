[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,232 filed on 11/4/2007, which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure relates generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br><br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A powertrain system in a motorized vehicle has an accelerator pedal<br>
and includes an engine coupled to an electro-mechanical transmission<br>
selectively operative in one of a plurality of transmission operating range<br>
states and one of a plurality of engine states. A method for controlling the<br>
powertrain system includes determining a current transmission operating range<br>
state and engine state, determining at least one potential transmission<br>
operating range state and engine state, providing at least one operator torque<br>
request, determining preferability factors associated with the current<br>
transmission operating range state and engine state, and potential transmission<br>
operating range states and engine states, wherein determining preferability<br>
factors associated with potential transmission operating range states includes<br>
assigning biasing costs to operator torque requests which reside within a pre-<br>
determined range of possible operator torque requests for at least two of the<br><br>
potential transmission operating range states, preferentially weighting the<br>
preferability factors for the current transmission operating range state and<br>
engine state, and selectively commanding changing the transmission operating<br>
range state and engine state based upon stheaid preferability factors and the<br>
operator torque request.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIG. 1 shows an exemplary electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain<br>
shown in FIG. 1 comprises a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14, and first and<br>
second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can<br>
be transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14<br><br>
and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as T1<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as N1; NA,and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0025] In one embodiment, the exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-<br>
cylinder internal combustion engine which is selectively operative in several<br>
states to transmit torque to the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can<br>
be either a spark-ignition or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14<br>
includes a crankshaft (not shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of<br>
the transmission 10. A rotational speed sensor 11 is preferably present to<br>
monitor rotational speed of the input shaft 12. Power output from the engine<br>
14, comprising rotational speed and output torque, can differ from the input<br>
speed, N1, and the input torque, T1, to the transmission 10 due to torque-<br>
consuming components being present on or in operative mechanical contact<br>
with the input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a<br>
hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0026] In one embodiment the exemplary transmission 10 comprises three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four selectively-engageable torque-<br>
transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used<br>
herein, clutches refer to any type of friction torque transfer device including<br>
single or compound plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for<br>
example. A hydraulic control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a<br>
transmission control module (hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control<br>
clutch states. In one embodiment, clutches C2 62 and C4 75 preferably<br>
comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. In one embodiment,<br><br>
clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 is preferably hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
preferably comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not<br>
shown) and a rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The<br>
motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the<br>
transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with electrical windings<br>
extending therefrom. The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second<br>
planetary gear set 26. The rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly<br>
attached to a sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
[0028] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br><br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0029] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, No and an output torque, To- A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br>
to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0030] The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br><br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br>
torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to<br>
achieve the input torques TA and TB- Electrical current is transmitted to and<br>
from the ESD 74 in accordance with commands provided to the TPIM which<br>
derive from such factors as including operator torque requests, current<br>
operating conditions and states, and such commands determine whether the<br>
ESD 74 is being charged, discharged or is in stasis at any given instant.<br>
[0031] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to achieve the input torques TA and TB. The power<br>
inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not<br>
shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering<br>
respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by<br>
switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a<br>
switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is<br>
typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of<br>
the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation<br>
or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive<br>
or supply DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to<br>
or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via<br><br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31, depending on commands received which are<br>
typically based on factors which include current operating state and operator<br>
torque demand.<br>
[0032] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator may selectively control or direct operation of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The devices present in UI 13 typically include<br>
an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which an operator torque request is<br>
determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector<br>
114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The<br>
transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number of operator-<br>
selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output member 64<br>
to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br><br><br>
[0033] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0034] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TO_REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques<br>
for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br><br><br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0035] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T1,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, N1. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters which may include<br>
without limitation: a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, throttle<br>
position, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. The engine load can<br>
be determined, for example, from the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from<br>
monitoring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23<br>
generates and communicates command signals to control engine actuators,<br>
which may include without limitation actuators such as: fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0036] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br><br><br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0037] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0038] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br><br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are preferably executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example at each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
operation of the powertrain. However, any interval between about 2<br>
milliseconds and about 300 milliseconds may be selected. Alternatively,<br>
algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of any selected<br>
event.<br>
[0039] The exemplary powertrain shown in reference to FIG. 1 is capable of<br>
selectively operating in any of several operating range states that can be<br>
described in terms of an engine state comprising one of an engine on state<br>
('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'), and a transmission state comprising a<br>
plurality of fixed gears and continuously variable operating modes, described<br>
with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br><br>
[0040] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. As an example, a first<br>
continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying<br>
clutch C1 70 only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M1_Eng_On') or<br>
OFF ('M1_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode<br>
2, or M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to<br>
the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of<br>
ON ('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off'). For purposes of this<br>
description, when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to<br>
zero revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.<br>
A fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission 10, i.e., N1/NO, is achieved. For example, a first<br>
fixed gear operation ('G1') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75.<br><br>
A second fixed gear operation ('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70<br>
and C2 62. A third fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying<br>
clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by<br>
applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-<br>
output speed increases with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased<br>
gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72, NAand NB respectively, are<br>
dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching<br>
and are proportional to the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0041] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, TCMD,<br>
intended to meet the operator torque request, To_REQ, to be executed at the<br>
output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Resultant vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon inputs which include a variety of operating characteristics of<br>
the powertrain. These include the operator torque request communicated<br>
through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13<br>
[0042] In some embodiments, the operating range state may be predicated on<br>
a powertrain torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or<br>
in a torque generating mode. In some embodiments, the operating range state<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines a<br>
preferential selection of the operating range state based upon inputs which<br><br><br>
may include: operator demand for power; battery state-of-charge; and<br>
operating efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56, 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine<br>
14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based upon pre-<br>
selected outcome criteria embedded in the executed selection routine, and<br>
system operation is controlled thereby to effectively manage resources<br>
commensurate with desired levels of ESD state-of-charge and fuel delivery.<br>
Moreover, operation can be determined, including over-riding of any desired<br>
feature(s), based upon detection of a fault in one or more components or sub-<br>
systems. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-generative devices, and determines<br>
the power output from the transmission 10 required to achieve the output<br>
torque necessary to meet the operator torque request. The ESD 74 and the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively<br>
coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0043] Given various operating conditions possible for a motorized vehicle<br>
equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, which include<br>
varied environmental and road conditions such as road grade and operator<br>
torque demands, it is generally possible for an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission to be usefully operatively engaged potentially in more than one<br>
transmission operating range state, including such range states specified in<br>
Table I, at a given time during its operation. Moreover, it may be true that for<br>
every change in road grade, throttle opening, and brake pedal depression that a<br><br><br>
motorized vehicle comprising an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission<br>
experiences during the course of its typical travel, differing transmission<br>
operating range state and engine states of the engine may at any time be<br>
viewed as being advantageous in consideration of an overall balance between<br>
such factors including fuel economy, required torque output of the<br>
transmission, and state-of-charge of the ESD 74. At any one instant in time, a<br>
particular transmission operating range state and engine state may be<br>
desirable, advantageous or preferred, while at subsequent instants in time other<br>
transmission operating range state and engine states may be desirable,<br>
advantageous or preferred, with the result being that over even a relatively<br>
short time span of operation such as, for example, five minutes, conditions<br>
making dozens or more desirable, advantageous, or preferred transmission<br>
operating range state and engine states exist during such time span. However,<br>
this disclosure provides that altering the transmission operating range state and<br>
engine state in response to each and every single change in operating<br>
conditions encountered is not necessarily desirable in a motorized vehicle<br>
having an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission.<br>
[0044] According to one embodiment of this disclosure, FIG. 3 shows a first<br>
plurality of numerical values, each of which represents a preferability factor<br>
for each of the potential operating range states of an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, and potential engine states for the engine, including the<br>
operating range states and engine states specified in Table I. In FIG. 3, the<br>
designations M1 and M2 refer to mode 1 and mode 2 of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission. The designations G1, G2, G3, and G4 refer<br>
to gear 1, gear 2, gear 3, and gear 4, respectively, and HEOff refers to the<br><br><br>
engine state, which engine state is either engine-on or engine-off. In one<br>
embodiment of this disclosure, any one or more such preferability factors may<br>
be arbitrarily assigned. In another embodiment, any one or more of such<br>
preferability factors may comprise an output generated as a result of any<br>
algorithmic or other data processing method which has as an input or basis any<br>
information provided by any one or more sensors disposed at any location on a<br>
motorized vehicle equipped with such an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, or disposed on, at, or near any portion of its drive train where<br>
data may be acquired. Such sensors may include without limitation: a wheel<br>
speed sensor 94, an output speed sensor 84, and a rotational speed sensor 11.<br>
[0045] It is desired that the preferability factors provided for each of the<br>
transmission operating range states and engine state shown in FIG. 3 are<br>
maintained in association with their respective transmission operating range<br>
state and engine state, and according to one embodiment of this disclosure<br>
such preferability factors are set forth in an array, as shown in FIG. 3. This<br>
arrangement is not a strict requirement, but is of convenience when<br>
performing a method according to this disclosure, as shown and described in<br>
relation to FIG. 4.<br>
[0046] This disclosure also provides a plurality of numerical values, each of<br>
which is associated with one of the possible operating range states and engine<br>
states of an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission at any selected point in<br>
time while in service in a motorized vehicle, such as during operation while a<br>
vehicle is traveling on a road surface, which plurality may be referred to as<br>
current operating range state values. Preferred embodiments include a<br>
numerical value associated with the engine state. This second plurality of<br><br><br>
numerical values are shown arranged in an array in FIG. 4 labeled as "current<br>
operating range factors" which includes numerical values for both the<br>
transmission operating range state and the engine state.<br>
[0047] FIG. 4 illustrates how the numerical values of the first plurality of<br>
preferability factors from FIG. 3 may be combined with the second plurality of<br>
preferability factors from the current operating range state and engine state. In<br>
one embodiment, the combination is made by summing the numerical values<br>
from each corresponding operating range state and engine state in each array,<br>
to arrive at a third array that comprises preferability factors for each possible<br>
transmission operating range state and engine state, which is labeled "new<br>
desired operating range factors". As used herein, a desired operating range<br>
state refers to a transmission operating range state or engine state that is, for<br>
one reason or another, generally relating to drivability, but may relate to<br>
engine economy, emissions or battery life, more desirable than the current<br>
transmission operating range state and/or engine state. The numerical values<br>
present in the third array may be compared to one another, and in one<br>
embodiment the lowest numerical value present in the third array represents<br>
the transmission operating range state or engine state which is to be selected or<br>
evaluated for selection as a basis upon which to make a change in operating<br>
state of the electro-mechanical hybrid transmission while a motorized vehicle<br>
containing same is in operation. For example, in the third array in FIG. 4, the<br>
lowest numerical value is 7, corresponding to mode 1 operation of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission, whereas the current operating range state for<br>
the transmission is mode 2, evidenced by the zero in the current operating<br>
range array being the lowest numerical value. In one illustrative, non-limiting<br><br><br>
exemplary embodiment, a signal would be sent to a shift execution module<br>
embedded in the TCM 17, suggesting a change of transmission operating<br>
range state from mode 2 to mode 1, which may be effected by the TCM. In<br>
alternate embodiments, the TCM may be provided with additional decision-<br>
making data and algorithms to either accept and execute a suggested command<br>
change resulting from a process according to this disclosure, or it may deny<br>
such execution, based on other factors programmed into the TCM 17 which<br>
can be arbitrary in one embodiment, and in other embodiments are based on<br>
the output of one or more algorithms having inputs provided by on-board<br>
vehicle sensors. In one embodiment of the disclosure, the TCM 17 provides<br>
current operating range factors, which may be in the same format that the<br>
numerical values for the second plurality of preferability factors are in. In<br>
other embodiments, the TCM 17 provides current operating range factors in<br>
any format different than that which the numerical values relating to the<br>
second plurality of preferability factors are in.<br>
[0048] In another embodiment, the first plurality of preferability factors<br>
described in reference to FIG. 3 may be combined with an alternative plurality<br>
of preferability factors, which are depicted in the array labeled as the "desired<br>
operating range factors" (which include numerical values for both the<br>
transmission operating range state and the engine state) in FIG. 4, to arrive at a<br>
third array comprising a set of preferability factors which are considered the<br>
"new desired operating range factors." The preferability factors comprising<br>
the desired operating range factors may be an output generated as a result of<br>
any algorithm or other data processing method of information provided by any<br>
one or more sensors disposed at any location on a motorized vehicle equipped<br><br><br>
with such an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, or disposed on, at, or<br>
near any portion of its drive train where data may be acquired. Such sensors<br>
include without limitation: a wheel speed sensor 94, an output speed sensor<br>
84, and a rotational speed sensor 11. In another embodiment, the first plurality<br>
of preferability factors described in reference to FIG. 3 may be combined with<br>
both the preferability factors from the current operating range factors and the<br>
desired operating range factors to arrive at a third array comprising new<br>
desired operating range factors.<br>
[0049] In general, one or more of the preferability factors among the desired<br>
operating range factors will change over time, in response to changing<br>
operating conditions encountered by a motorized vehicle equipped with an<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, and the value of these factors may<br>
either increase or decrease during vehicle operation. For example, when an<br>
operator makes a torque request upon encountering an uphill grade while<br>
traveling at a low speed, the preferability factor associated with gear 1<br>
operation may be caused to decrease in value in response thereto. Similarly,<br>
when the vehicle operator makes a braking torque request upon encountering<br>
an downhill grade while traveling at a constant speed, the preferability factor<br>
associated with gear 1 operation may be caused to increase substantially in<br>
value so that selection of the gear 1 operating range is essentially precluded.<br>
[0050] In FIG. 4, the numerical values in the arrays comprising the current<br>
operating range factors and the desired operating range factors are identical<br>
only for illustrative purposes, and in practice the numerical values present in<br>
these sets of preferability factors may differ from one another. For<br>
embodiments in which the first plurality of preferability factors from FIG. 3<br><br><br>
are combined with those of the desired operating range factors, a third array<br>
comprising preferability factors for a new desired operating range factors are<br>
provided, at least one of which factors are subsequently provided to a shift<br>
control module which may be embedded in the TCM 17. For instances in<br>
which the shift control module orders the execution of a change in<br>
transmission operating range state, engine state, or both, the preferability<br>
factors comprising the new desired operating range factors are communicated<br>
as an input to a process of this disclosure as the desired operating range factors<br>
in a subsequent iteration of a process as herein described, as it is desirable in<br>
such embodiments to repeatedly perform a method as described herein at any<br>
time interval desired or selected, which may be any interval between about 2<br>
milliseconds and about 300 milliseconds, including all intervals and ranges of<br>
intervals therebetween.<br>
[0051] In preferred combinations of preferability factors according to the<br>
disclosure, it is desirable to only combine preferability factors of like kind<br>
with one another, i.e., preferability factors relating to M1 may only be<br>
combined with other preferability factors which relate to Ml, G2 with G2, and<br>
so forth. Although combination of arrays, each of which comprise a plurality<br>
of preferability factors according to one embodiment of this disclosure has<br>
been shown and described as involving the summation of such arrays, and<br>
selecting the least value present in an array as a value for consideration in<br>
making a change in the operating range of an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, the present disclosure also includes embodiments in which the<br>
selection criteria is to choose the largest numerical value. In other<br>
embodiments, the combination of two or more arrays may include subtraction,<br><br><br>
division, or multiplication of the numerical values corresponding to each<br>
operating range present in the arrays so combined, to provide that one of the<br>
values emerges as unique or differentiable from the remaining values present<br>
as a result of such combination, each value representing a relative preferability<br>
of the engine state or transmission range state. Selection is then made basis<br>
the highest or lowest numerical value present, or any other differentiable<br>
numerical attribute, in each of such embodiments. For cases where two or<br>
more preferability factors present in a set or array which results from a<br>
combination of preferability factors as provided herein are identical or non-<br>
differentiable from one another, the selection of a transmission operating<br>
range from such non-differentiable values may be arbitrary, or may be set to<br>
any default selection desired.<br>
[0052] In one embodiment of the disclosure, the numerical values of the first<br>
plurality of preferability factors in the array shown in FIG. 3 may be selected<br>
to be of a size sufficient to provide a biasing effect when combined with<br>
numerical values present in either the desired operating range factors or<br>
current operating range factors as described in reference to FIG. 4. For<br>
convenience according to one embodiment, sets of such preferability factors<br>
from FIG. 3 may be provided and arranged in a matrix, as shown in Table II<br>
and Table HI below:<br><br><br><br>
Thus, a plurality of preferability factors for the current operating range factors<br>
may be provided from such matrix. Under such an arrangement, if the current<br>
operating range of the electro-mechanical hybrid transmission is mode 1, then<br>
numerical values from the first row are chosen as the numerical values for the<br>
array to be used in a combination of arrays as described herein. Arrays for the<br>
desired operating range factors may be selected from a matrix such as that<br>
shown in Table III, as representative of preferability factor values associated<br>
with the desired operating range state of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission and engine state.<br><br><br>
[0053] When combining arrays comprising current operating range factors<br>
and desirable operating range factors described in reference to FIG. 4 with a<br>
plurality of preferability factors as provided in reference to FIG. 3 according<br>
to this disclosure, the net effect is to stabilize the shifting of the transmission<br>
to both the desired operating range and the current operating range by<br>
inclusion of the preferability factors provided according to FIG. 3. Through<br>
judicious selection of the values in Tables II and III above, an unexpected<br>
benefit arises in that it is possible to select values which prohibit specific<br>
changes in operating range states of an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission. For example, a change in operating range from mode 2 to gear 4<br>
may be permitted, whereas a change in operating range from mode 2 to gear 3<br>
may be forbidden, the choices of which changes to permit or forbid being in<br>
control of the user of a method herein by their judicious selection of numerical<br>
values for the preferability factors. In general, it is desirable to avoid selecting<br>
non-allowed range states, whether based on output speed of the transmission<br>
or any other criteria selected by a user. In one embodiment, different potential<br>
input speeds for mode 1 and mode 2 operation of the transmission are<br>
considered over time in providing corresponding numerical values for these<br>
states in the first plurality of numerical values, independent of the desired<br>
transmission operating range state. According to one embodiment, a selection<br>
process involves consideration only of the input speed associated with the<br>
desired transmission operating state selected. In one preferred embodiment,<br>
the numerical value representative of the current transmission operating range<br>
state has a bias of zero. In other embodiments, the numerical value<br><br>
representative of the current transmission operating range state has a relatively<br>
small bias, and may be either positive or negative. Although shown as<br>
positive numerical values, a preferability factor according to the disclosure<br>
may be negative, since the net result of a process herein which combines the<br>
different preferability factors for the result specified depends generally on<br>
their relative magnitudes with respect to one another.<br>
[0054] The net effect of the stabilization of shifting events or changes of<br>
operating range of an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission according to this<br>
disclosure is illustrated in FIG. 5A, which uses power loss as its ordinate;<br>
however, other units of ordinate may be employed as desired. In FIG. 5A the<br>
power loss associated with vehicle operation in gear 1 over time of varying<br>
operating conditions is shown by the dotted wavy line. As this power loss<br>
varies along the abscissa of time labeled as mode 1, it may be possible for<br>
other operating range states of the electro-mechanical hybrid transmission to<br>
be employed to advantage with respect to fuel economy, battery state-of-<br>
charge, total torque output, etc. However, given typical wide variance in<br>
torque demands over time by an operator, a plurality of shifting or<br>
transmission mode changes would adversely impact drivability of a vehicle so<br>
equipped. Hence, by the present incorporation of bias, by consideration of the<br>
preferability factors described, the power loss associated with vehicle<br>
operation in gear 1 over time of varying operating conditions may be moved<br>
upwards on the ordinate scale, to the corresponding solid wavy line, the<br>
amount of which bias is represented by the sum of factors A and B from the<br>
first row in Table II and Table III respectively. The result of this with<br>
reference to FIG. 5A is that the transmission operating range remains in mode<br><br>
1 until the power loss associated with operating in that mode, plus the bias<br>
amount, exceeds the power loss of operating in another operating range state,<br>
in this case gear 1, at which point a change in operating range state is effected,<br>
with the power loss throughout the depicted time interval following the path<br>
marked by solid circles. Accordingly, situations where excessive operating<br>
range state changes of an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission occur, are<br>
maintained at any desirable level, dictated by the preferability factors chosen,<br>
which can mean their minimization, as well as substantial or complete<br>
elimination. This result is also depicted in FIG. 5B, which shows the<br>
transmission desired operating range state as ordinate, depicting the removal<br>
of what would have been deemed as an undesirable operating range state<br>
change for some end-use applications of a vehicle equipped with an electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission according to the disclosure.<br>
[0055] In one embodiment, the matrices, arrays, or other arrangements of<br>
preferability factors as described herein are caused to be present in or<br>
accessible to a microprocessor, in hard or soft memory, and the combinations<br>
described herein are preferably carried out using such a processing device,<br>
which then issues an output to a TCM 17 that itself employs such output as an<br>
input in its own decision-making process. However, any arrangement of the<br>
preferability factors in memory which is convenient for computing purposes<br>
may be employed, in addition to such matrices or arrays as herein described.<br>
Individual preferability factors may relate to, or be based upon any number of<br>
potential variables relating to vehicle operation, and include without limitation<br>
variables relating to energy usage, drivability, fuel economy, tailpipe<br>
emissions, and battery state-of-charge, with information concerning such<br><br>
variables being provided in one embodiment, by sensors. In other<br>
embodiments, the preferability factors may be derived from or based on losses<br>
in the entire mechanical drive system, including losses due to belts, pulleys,<br>
valves, chains, losses in the electrical system, heat losses, electrical machine<br>
power losses, internal battery power loses, or any other parasitic loss in a<br>
vehicle system, taken either alone, or in combination with any one or more<br>
other loss or losses.<br>
[0056] FIG. 6 depicts an architecture including a microprocessor, which is<br>
capable of carrying out execution of a change of operating range state of an<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission according to one embodiment of the<br>
disclosure. FIG. 6 shows microprocessor MP, having inputs of the current<br>
desired range preferability factors, and the preferability factors described in<br>
reference to FIG. 3. The microprocessor has an output, which is inputted to a<br>
transmission control module, TCM 17, which itself provides feedback to the<br>
microprocessor in the form of a plurality of current operating range state<br>
preferability factors. The TCM 17 is capable of providing a suggested shift<br>
execution command to the transmission 10.<br>
[0057] Operation of a vehicle equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission as herein described (including functionally-equivalent devices)<br>
also includes the transmission input speed, N|, which itself is subject to change<br>
as vehicle operating conditions encountered during travel of a motorized<br>
vehicle vary. After undergoing a change in operating conditions, it is true that<br>
in many cases a different transmission operating range state may become more<br>
desirably employed than the present or current transmission operating range<br>
state. In general, the transmission input speed N1 are different for different<br><br>
transmission operating range states possible when the motorized vehicle is<br>
traveling at the same given speed, when different operating modes or<br>
transmission operating states are contemplated as being employed as alternate<br>
operative modalities for operating at a same given speed. Accordingly, a<br>
change in transmission operating state and/or engine state is desirably<br>
accompanied by a change in transmission input speed N1.<br>
[0058] FIG. 7 illustrates graphically one example of how the transmission<br>
input speed N1 may vary over time when a vehicle equipped with an electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission as herein described undergoes an exemplary<br>
change in operating range state from M14 to M2. The N1 for M1 represents the<br>
current N1 when the current transmission operating range state is M1. G2 N1<br>
and M2 N1 represent the selected (desired) N1 for the corresponding<br>
transmission operating range states. Since a direct change of operating range<br>
state from M1 to M2 is forbidden, the transmission must first pass through G2.<br>
During such a transition, the necessary transmission input speed N1 is seen to<br>
first decrease when going from M1 to G2, then to increase slightly over time<br>
during brief operation in G2, after which a steep increase in N1 is experienced<br>
in achieving M2 operation. Therefore, the path or "trip" that the transmission<br>
input speed N1 is seen to go through is given by:<br><br>
in which M1 N1 is the transmission input speed for transmission M1 operation;<br>
G2 N1 is the transmission input speed for transmission G2 operation, M2 N1 is<br>
the transmission input speed for transmission M2 operation, and G2 N1 is the<br><br>
transmission input speed for transmission G2 operation. By weighting the<br>
direction of change of N1, the total "cost" of the trip that the transmission input<br>
speed is seen to go through can be provided by a calculation of the type:<br><br>
in which the "*" character indicates a multiplication operation, and a and b are<br>
constants in which a is used for negative changes in N1 and in which b is used<br>
for positive changes in N1. In alternate embodiments, a and b are varying<br>
parameters which are a function of the corresponding distance of the N1 trip or<br>
the corresponding desired transmission operating range state. The variable x,<br>
a trip-direction weighting constant, is a subjective value which may be set or<br>
determined by the vehicle engineers. The determination of x takes into<br>
account whether a potential change in transmission operating range state first<br>
requires a shift up followed by a shift down, or whether it first requires a shift<br>
down, followed by a shift up, as shown in FIG. 7. If the required sequence is<br>
shift down, then shift up, then x is set to a subjectively-determined value c. If<br>
the required sequence is shift up then shift down, the x is set to a subjectively-<br>
determined value d. For the case illustrated in FIG. 7, the formula for<br>
determining TC is:<br><br>
By analogous arithmetic a trip costing factor (TC) may be readily provided for<br>
every potential change in transmission operating range state and engine state<br><br>
by consideration of the trip that the N1 must pass for a given potential change<br>
in transmission operating range state and engine state at any point in time of<br>
the vehicle travel. Although the changes in N1 shown in FIG. 7 follow a<br>
straight-line path for purposes of illustration, in actual operation the changes in<br>
N1 may also follow curved paths during all or a portion of the transition,<br>
wherein the paths may be either concave-up or concave-down. As shown as<br>
occurring at different points in time in FIG. 7, the calculation of the N1 values<br>
for M1, which in this example is the origin of the trip is that of the monitored<br>
current N1 value, and the calculation of N1 values for G2 and M2 operation,<br>
which represent the intermediate and final destinations of the trip, may be<br>
conducted simultaneously.<br>
[0059] FIG. 8 graphically illustrates how selected values of N1 may vary<br>
over time for each transmission operating range state shown during the<br>
operation of a motorized vehicle equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission as herein described. The current N1 profile represents the<br>
monitored current N1 values, which in this example is when the current<br>
transmission operating range state is Ml. In one embodiment, the selected N1<br>
values (which may in alternate embodiments be desired N1 values or required<br>
N1 values) at various points in time are arbitrarily selected to yield the curves<br>
shown. In other embodiments the selected N1 values at various points in time<br>
are based on the output of one or more algorithms having inputs provided by<br>
on-board vehicle sensors, which after manipulation such as by a<br>
microprocessor may provide curves similar or different to those shown in FIG.<br>
8. Importantly, as shown in FIG. 9, for each point in time Tx under<br>
consideration, there is associated with each of such curves a single point,<br><br>
which may be used as a basis for calculating the differences in rpm, labeled "A<br>
rpm" which differences in rpm are useful in determining a trip costing factor<br>
associated with every potential change in transmission operating range state<br>
for any desired point in time. While rpm is used herein to exemplify one<br>
implementation, other rotational speed metrics are equally applicable. In one<br>
embodiment, the A rpm values may be conveniently set forth in an array as in<br><br>
wherein the rpm differences associated with M2 involves the rpm difference<br>
M1 to G2 and G2 to M2 as earlier described. The M1 N, value used for the A<br>
rpm calculation is that of the current M1 N1 value and not that of the selected<br>
M1 N1 value. The values for the A rpm in Table IV are exemplary of those<br>
encountered when the transmission is presently in M1 operation, as the value<br>
of the A rpm for M1 is zero, which has a biasing effect that tends to maintain<br>
the transmission operating range state in Ml, thus stabilizing the transmission<br>
operating range state with respect to M1 operation. In one embodiment, the<br>
values for the A rpm associated with each potential change in transmission<br>
operating range state, such as those provided in Table IV, are each next<br>
multiplied by the trip direction weighting constants a, b, c, d (which in<br>
alternate embodiments may be varying parameters which are a function of the<br>
corresponding distance of the trip, A rpm, or corresponding desired range)<br><br>
from the equation defining TC above for each associated potential change in<br>
transmission operating range state, to arrive at a new array comprising a<br>
plurality of Trips Costing factors (TC) representing preferability factors for<br>
each of the transmission operating range states that are effectively based on<br>
the input speed trip or profile associated with each potential change in<br>
operating range state of the transmission, of which the values in Table V are<br>
provided for exemplary purposes and are non-limiting of this disclosure:<br><br>
[0060] The preferability factors based on the input speed trip or profile<br>
("transmission input speed trip preferability factors") associated with each<br>
potential operating range state of the transmission as set forth in Table V may<br>
be combined as herein specified with other sets of preferability factors,<br>
including one or more sets of preferability factors shown in and described with<br>
reference to FIG. 4 towards generation of new desired operating range factors.<br>
The selected N1 values at various points in time as shown in FIG. 8 may be<br>
based on the output of one or more algorithms carried out in a microprocessor<br>
having one or more inputs provided by on-board vehicle sensors, including<br>
without limitation sensors mentioned herein. In some embodiments,<br>
transmission input speeds N1 for M1 operation and M2 operation are provided<br>
at selected intervals with regard to the desired operating range state of the<br>
transmission. In one embodiment, the N1 value for M1 is selected by a<br>
microprocessor which searches and selects an N1 value that is associated with<br><br>
the least power loss, which in this embodiment may serve as, or as a basis for<br>
determining the preferability factor for M1 operation from FIG. 3. At or at<br>
about the same time, the N1 value for M2 operation is selected by a<br>
microprocessor which searches and selects an N1 value that is associated with<br>
the least power loss, which in this embodiment may serve as, or as a basis for<br>
determining the preferability factor for M2 operation from FIG. 3. Slight<br>
changes in operating conditions can substantially alter the preferability factors,<br>
and could result in transmission operation that would attempt to change gears<br>
or modes too frequently, and the biasing or weighting of the preferability<br>
factors as herein described alleviates undesirably frequent shifting. For<br>
embodiments in which N1 values for M1 and M2 are continuously provided at<br>
short time intervals on the order of milliseconds in response to changes in<br>
vehicle operating conditions, given that slight changes in operating conditions<br>
can substantially alter the preferability factors, it occurs that there may be<br>
wide fluctuations in the N1 values for M1 and M2 from one time interval to the<br>
next. Changing operating range state for every instance that a driving<br>
condition changed slightly would result essentially in a transmission which<br>
was nearly constantly attempting to change gears or modes, and the biasing or<br>
weighting of the preferability factors as herein described alleviates undesirably<br>
frequent shifting. Following generation of new desired operating range factors<br>
and selection of the desired operating range, the N1 values for the desired<br>
operating range are evaluated for selection and it is frequently the case that the<br>
N1 values may vary substantially from one interval to the next. It is<br>
accordingly desirable to "filter" the N| values, to remove noise, which noise<br>
comprises values that are very high above or below an average N1 value owing<br><br>
to instantaneous fluctuation in the N1 values during one or more short time<br>
intervals. In one embodiment, N1 values for both M1 operation, M2 operation<br>
and neutral are filtered, even though the values of only one of M1 or M2 are<br>
actually to be used at a given point in time, i.e., the system continuously<br>
provides N1 values for both M1 and M2 operation. In such embodiment, while<br>
input speeds N1 for M1 or M2 operation are provided continuously or at<br>
selected intervals, only the input speed N1 associated with the desired mode<br>
(either M1 or M2) is used for creating a desired transmission input speed<br>
profile based on current vehicle operating conditions. After selection of a<br>
desired range state is made, the selected N1 values for M1 and M2 are filtered<br>
to reduce noise, while filtering, when the desired range changes reset the filter<br>
of the mode of the desired range that it is transitioning to, in order that the<br>
initial output value is equivalent to the input value, as shown in FIG. 10. The<br>
suggested N1 values depicted therein will eventually be used to create a profile<br>
of desired input speeds based on what range is desired. For example, when<br>
M1 is selected as the desired range, N1 M1 is used as the desired N1 profile, as<br>
soon as M2 becomes desired the profile will switch to suggested N1 M2. This<br>
selective resetting is done so that when the system switches from one profile<br>
to another, the non-filtered suggested N1 is used as the initial value. When<br>
filtering the suggested input speeds for noise reduction, only the suggested<br>
input speed of the desired mode is filtered. This allows the suggested input<br>
speed to reset when its mode is chosen.<br>
[0061] One consideration of operating a motorized vehicle that is equipped<br>
with an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission as described herein, is that the<br>
operator of such a motorized vehicle will at different times make different<br><br>
torque requests from the drivetrain (such as by depressing the accelerator or<br>
brake pedal). However, in many instances of operator torque requests, the<br>
drivetrain and/or braking system may be incapable of delivering the amount of<br>
torque requested by the operator, i.e., the brake or accelerator pedal may be<br>
depressed beyond the point at which the system capabilities to deliver the<br>
requested torque can be fulfilled.<br>
[0062] For different engine operating points in potential operating range<br>
states of the transmission, given the same operator torque request, the<br>
differences between the operator-requested torque and the drivetrain<br>
capabilities typically differ from one another. In one embodiment of this<br>
disclosure, the difference between the amount of torque requested by the<br>
operator at a given point in time and the torque that is deliverable by the<br>
system when operating at a potential engine operating point is considered for<br>
each of the engine operating points, to generate a plurality of torque difference<br>
values for each of the engine operating points at substantially the time that the<br>
operator makes a torque request. In one embodiment a biasing "cost" value is<br>
assigned to each of the torque difference values in proportion to the magnitude<br>
by which the deliverable torque for a given engine operating point in a<br>
potential transmission operating range state falls short with respect to that of<br>
the operator torque request. Such biasing cost values generally reflect a lower<br>
degree of desirability for engine operating points having higher biasing costs<br>
associated with them for a given operator torque request, when such biasing<br>
costs are compared with one another and used as a basis in evaluating which<br>
engine operating point is most suitable or desirable for a given operator torque<br>
request at a particular point in time of the vehicle operation. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the sum of all components representing power losses for various<br>
drivetrain components and this bias cost (comprising the total power loss) for<br>
each potential engine operating point at the torque deliverable that is nearest to<br>
that requested by the vehicle operator are compared with one another, with<br>
that potential engine operating point having the least total power loss when<br>
operated at the torque nearest that of the operator request being selected as the<br>
desired engine operating point.<br>
[0063] FIG. 11 shows a cost function useful in providing biasing costs<br>
indicating a component of preferability of a potential engine operating point<br>
and transmission operating range state, which is dependent on the magnitude<br>
of a torque request made by the operator. The exemplary definition of a<br>
biasing cost graph in FIG. 11 is a generally-parabolic cost profile, having as its<br>
abscissa the operator torque request. Such a biasing cost profile may be<br>
determined by any function desired, selected, or created by the vehicle<br>
engineers, and accordingly affords an opportunity to include a subjective<br>
aspect in the determination of preferability of different engine operating points<br>
and potential transmission operating range states. Function types useful in this<br>
regard include without limitation: hyperbolic functions, linear functions,<br>
continuous functions, non-continuous functions, constant functions, smooth-<br>
curved functions, circular functions, ovoid functions, and any combinations<br>
comprising any of the foregoing, either alone or mathematically combined<br>
with one another, over any range of operator torque request values desired or<br>
selected. Thus, in one embodiment, criteria used in the determination of<br>
which engine operating point and transmission operating range state is most<br>
desirable for a given operator torque request at any selected point in time of<br><br>
the travel of a vehicle having a drivetrain as herein described is not necessarily<br>
bound to the most efficient operation of the motorized vehicle in terms of fuel<br>
economy, power output, drivability, etc.<br>
[0064] For each engine operating point and potential transmission operating<br>
range state, there exists a minimum output torque (To Min) and a maximum<br>
output torque (To Max) that the drivetrain system is capable of delivering.<br>
The maximum output torque is generally applicable towards vehicle<br>
acceleration and includes such components as torque inputted to the<br>
transmission by the engine and torque supplied to the transmission by the<br>
electric machines. The minimum output torque is generally applicable<br>
towards vehicle deceleration, and includes such components as braking torque<br>
provided during regenerative braking, including cases when the charging of a<br>
battery on-board the vehicle is accomplished, more or less, by one or more<br>
electric machines functioning in their capacity as electrical generators.<br>
[0065] With respect to FIG. 11, which represents a single engine operating<br>
point in a potential transmission operating range state, it is clear that for a<br>
substantial range of possible operator torque request values residing between<br>
To Min and To Max, there is no biasing cost associated therewith, i.e., the<br>
value of the function represented by the dotted line is zero. As the operator<br>
torque request approaches or exceeds the To Max value, however, the cost<br>
associated with the operator torque request is given by the ordinate value<br>
along the dotted line curve corresponding to the operator torque request.<br>
Other potential transmission operating range states may have the same,<br>
similarly-shaped, or differently-shaped functions associated with them, as<br>
desired.<br><br>
[0066] In one embodiment, if the operator torque request is within a range<br>
between To Min and To Max where the biasing cost function represented by<br>
the dashed line curve in FIG. 11 is constant, in this case at zero, there is no<br>
biasing cost assigned for the particular engine operating point in the operating<br>
range state under consideration at levels of operator torque request residing<br>
within this range. When the operator torque request is for a torque that is<br>
greater than To Max, the function determining the biasing costs associated<br>
with the torque request is represented by the dashed line in FIG. 11. This<br>
biasing cost may thus comprise a subjective component in addition to the<br>
objective costs associated with power losses in the determination of the engine<br>
operating point selection and the first plurality of numerical values shown in<br>
FIG. 3. Thus, in one embodiment, an operator torque request which only<br>
slightly exceeds that of To Max, by, for example, 10 Newton-meters, will be<br>
assigned a biasing cost which is less than the biasing cost which would be<br>
assigned to an operator torque request which exceeds that of To Max by more<br>
than 10 Newton-meters.<br>
[0067] Table VI below is exemplary of one way to express costs associated<br>
with the difference between a vehicle operator torque request and the<br>
maximum torque deliverable by the drivetrain system for an exemplary<br>
potential transmission operating range state, wherein Δ N*m is the difference<br>
value in Newton-meters and kW is the cost, expressed in kilowatts in this<br>
example; however any other convenient units, or no units, may be used. Such<br>
an array may be stored in computer memory and accessed by a<br>
microprocessor, on an as-needed basis.<br>
Table VI<br><br><br>
[0068] An alternative representation of the biasing cost associated with a<br>
potential transmission operating range state is shown in FIG. 12. In FIG. 12,<br>
the value x represents the difference between the amount of torque requested<br>
by the operator and that torque output which is desirable ("Desirable To") for a<br>
potential transmission operating range state, as but one example. The<br>
Desirable To is that amount of torque that is closest to the operator torque<br>
request that is available based on the output torque limits (To Max and To<br>
Min) of the selected engine operating points and the Torque Reserve for the<br>
particular potential transmission operating range state under consideration.<br>
The quantity x, which is a torque difference value (Δ N*m), varies, depending<br>
on which potential transmission operating state is under consideration, for the<br>
same operator torque request at a same given point in time of the vehicle<br>
operation. Comparison of x values for different potential transmission<br>
operating range states given the same operator torque request enables selection<br>
of that potential transmission operating range state having the least x value, in<br>
one embodiment. In another embodiment, a biasing cost (weighting factor)<br>
may be assigned to the potential transmission operating range state having the<br>
least x value, which is combined with the sum of all components representing<br>
power losses for various drivetrain components, to arrive at a sum total power<br>
loss which may then be used as a criteria for selecting a particular potential<br>
transmission operating range state over others.<br><br>
[0069] By providing a function having any desired features, including<br>
without limitation those features illustrated by the biasing costs curve in FIG.<br>
11, it is possible to assign a biasing cost to a given operator torque request for<br>
particular instances even when the torque requested in an operator torque<br>
request is below the maximum system torque output. This is illustrated by an<br>
operator torque request having the magnitude at point Q in FIG. 11, which is<br>
below the To Max, yet there is nevertheless a cost assigned for this potential<br>
transmission operating range state and operator torque request. Such a<br>
provision of costing (or biasing) operator torque requests allows establishment<br>
of a Torque Reserve over the range of operator torque requests which reside<br>
between To Max and the operator torque request having the highest magnitude<br>
of torque for which no biasing cost is assigned over a range between To Min<br>
and To Max. The provision of a range of operator torque requests comprising<br>
such a Torque Reserve effectively biases the preferability of the transmission<br>
control system against selecting system actuator operating points and<br>
transmission operating range states having a To Max which is greater than, yet<br>
near to, an operator torque request in an amount that is proportional to the<br>
difference between the operator torque request and the To Max for the<br>
particular engine operating point in a transmission operating range state under<br>
consideration. Instead of biasing to select system actuator operating points<br>
which can produce the highest To Max and lowest To Min, including the<br>
Torque Reserve has the effect of decreasing the bias criteria point To Max to<br>
To Max subtracted by the Torque Reserve. This will not only effect the<br>
operator torque requests which exceed the maximum deliverable output<br>
torque, but also the operator torque requests that are less than and near the<br><br>
maximum deliverable output torque. This results in improved drivability of<br>
the motorized vehicle by reducing the tendency of the transmission system to<br>
cause multiple shifting events or mode changes when an operator torque<br>
request has a magnitude that is near the maximum deliverable for the<br>
transmission operating range state that is currently selected, i.e., currently<br>
under utilization. In embodiments which follow, no Torque Reserve is<br>
present.<br>
[0070] Moreover, when an operator torque request exceeds To Max (or is<br>
less than To Min) for cases where a method according to this disclosure which<br>
so uses biasing costs is not employed, information relating to the amount by<br>
which an operator torque request exceeds To Max (or is less than To Min) is<br>
lost due to the fact that the total power loss evaluation is based on the<br>
deliverable output torque which is limited by To Max and To Min.<br>
Proceeding in accordance with a method of this disclosure and obtaining a<br>
biasing cost value for an operator torque request which exceeds To Max (or is<br>
less than To Min) provides information relative to the amount by which such a<br>
torque request is in excess of To Max, and this information is incorporated<br>
into the overall selection process concerning which engine operating point and<br>
potential transmission operating state will be selected. In one embodiment,<br>
this information effectively biases a search engine embedded within software<br>
and/or hardware useful for providing the plurality of numerical values shown<br>
in FIG. 3 to locate an engine operating point within each potential<br>
transmission operating range state that biases towards providing the greatest<br>
value of To Max (least value of To Min). In one embodiment, the biasing<br>
costs associated with the operator torque request for each of the potential<br><br>
operating range states of the transmission substantially at the time an operator<br>
makes a torque request during vehicle operation are but one component used<br>
in determining a first plurality of numerical values as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0071] In one embodiment, the calculation of each of the numerical values<br>
present in the first plurality of numerical values shown in FIG. 3 include<br>
components relating to objective power losses such as: engine power loss,<br>
battery power loss, electrical machine power loss, and transmission power<br>
loss. Another embodiment provides additional penalty costs, including costs<br>
for exceeding the battery power limits, engine torque limits, electric machine<br>
torque limits, and other subjective costs desired which may include biasing<br>
costs associated with the output torque request as herein described. Also<br>
included are the components generated as the result of an iterative data<br>
processing method that in one embodiment employs a microprocessor-based<br>
search engine.<br>
[0072] In the case of continuously variable operating mode range states,<br>
search engine suitable for such a method employs, for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state, a space that is defined as shown in FIG. 13<br>
by the region on the coordinate axes bounded by P1 Min, P1 Max, N1 Min, and<br>
N1 Max, wherein P1 represents power inputted to the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission and N1 is the same transmission input speed. The search engine<br>
selects, either randomly or according to any desired algorithm, an N1 and P1<br>
pair present in the space S and calculates a To Min, To Max, and total power<br>
loss associated with the N1 and P1 pair chosen, based on drivetrain system<br>
component power losses and operating constraints, which constraints are<br>
either inherent in the system, or imposed by vehicle engineers. Repetition of<br><br>
this method for a large number of different N1 and P1 pairs provides a plurality<br>
of different To Min, To Max, and total power loss values for a given potential<br>
transmission operating range state. The method is repeated for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state and a plurality of To Min, To Max, and<br>
total power loss values are generated in the space S of and for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state and N1 and P1 pairs provided.<br>
[0073] From such plurality of different To Min and To Max values so<br>
generated by a search engine for a given potential transmission operating<br>
range state, the N1 and P1 pair having the highest To Max value associated with<br>
each potential transmission operating range state is biased to be selected as the<br>
preferred N1 and P1, to reduce biasing costs associated with the output torque<br>
request in FIG. 11, which is one of the multiple components in the total power<br>
loss, when an operator torque request is greater than the plurality of different<br>
To Max values generated. For cases in which an operator torque request is<br>
less than the plurality of different To Min generated, the N1 and P1 pair<br>
associated with the lowest To Min value is biased to be selected as the<br>
preferred N1 and P1 to reduce biasing costs associated with the output torque<br>
request in FIG. 11, which is one of the multiple components in the total power<br>
loss for the particular potential transmission operating range state under<br>
consideration. The hybrid Engine-Off state can be considered as continuously<br>
variable modes with the N1 and P1 as being zero; thus, To Min, To Max, and<br>
the total power loss are determined without the need for a search procedure.<br>
[0074] In the case of Fixed Gear range states, a search engine suitable for<br>
such a method employs, for each potential transmission operating range state,<br>
a space that is defined by the region on the coordinate axes bounded by T1<br><br>
Min, and T1 Max, wherein T1 represents torque inputted to the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission where the transmission input speed is<br>
predetermined by the hardware parameter of potential transmission operating<br>
range state. The search engine selects, either randomly or according to any<br>
desired algorithm, a T1 present in the search range and calculates a To Min and<br>
To Max and Total Power Loss associated with the T1 chosen, based on<br>
drivetrain system component power losses and operating constraints, which<br>
constraints are either inherent in the system, or imposed by vehicle engineers.<br>
Repetition of this method for a large number of different T1 provides a<br>
plurality of different To Min and To Max and Total Power Loss values for a<br>
given potential transmission operating range state. The method is repeated for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state and a plurality of To Min and<br>
To Max and Total Power Loss are generated in the search range of and for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state and T1 is provided.<br>
[0075] From such plurality of different To Min and To Max values so<br>
generated by a search engine for a given potential transmission operating<br>
range state, the T1 having the highest To Max value associated with each<br>
potential transmission operating range state is biased to be selected as the<br>
preferred T1 , when an operator torque request is greater than the plurality of<br>
different To Max generated. This reduces biasing costs associated with the<br>
output torque request in FIG. 11, which is one of the components in the total<br>
power loss for the particular potential transmission operating range state under<br>
consideration. For cases in which an operator torque request is less than the<br>
plurality of different To Min generated , the T1 associated with the lowest To<br>
Min value is biased to be selected as the preferred T1 to reduce biasing costs<br><br>
associated with the output torque request in FIG. 11, which is one of the<br>
components in the total power loss for the particular potential transmission<br>
operating range state under consideration.<br>
[0076] In one embodiment, including when a vehicle operator makes a<br>
request for an acceleration torque that is greater than the maximum deliverable<br>
output torque, following generation of a plurality of engine operating points<br>
(N1 and P1 pairs for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state, which engine operating<br>
points (N1 and P1 pairs for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears)<br>
each have associated with them a To Min, To Max, and total power loss<br>
values, the desired transmission operating range state is determined by<br>
comparing the points associated with the selected engine operating points (N1<br>
and P1 pairs for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) from each<br>
potential transmission operating state with one another, and selecting that<br>
operating range state having the least total power loss associated with its point<br>
biased to the highest To Max value, which corresponds to the least value of x<br>
in FIG. 12.<br>
[0077] In another embodiment, including when a vehicle operator makes a<br>
request for a deceleration torque that is less than the minimum deliverable<br>
output torque, following generation of a plurality of engine operating points<br>
(N1, P1 pairs for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) for each<br>
potential transmission operating range state, which engine operating points<br>
(N1, P1 pairs for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) each have<br>
associated with them a To Min, To Max, and total power loss values, the<br>
desired transmission operating range state is determined by comparing the<br><br>
points associated with the selected engine operating points (N1 and P1 pairs for<br>
continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) from each potential<br>
transmission operating state which have the least total power loss with one<br>
another and selecting that operating range state having the least total power<br>
loss associated with its point biased to having the lowest To Min value<br>
(corresponding to the least value of y in FIG. 12).<br>
[0078] In one embodiment, determination of the total power loss associated<br>
with vehicle operation at a point associated with or identified by an engine<br>
operating point (an engine operating point, as used herein, has associated with<br>
it an N1, P1 pair for continuously variable modes, and a T1 value in the case of<br>
fixed gears) in a potential operating range state of the transmission comprises<br>
combining operating costs, in terms of energy usage (kW), which operating<br>
costs are provided based upon factors related to vehicle drivability, fuel<br>
economy, emissions, electrical power consumption and battery life for the<br>
operating range state. Lower operating costs are generally associated with<br>
lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power<br>
usage, and lower emissions for an operating point, and take into account a<br>
current operating range state of the powertrain system.<br>
[0079] Summation of all power losses (total power loss) associated with<br>
operating at a particular point that is associated with an engine operating point<br>
of a potential transmission operating range state provides a preferability factor<br>
(such as those shown in FIG. 3) for operating at that particular point in the<br>
particular potential transmission operating range state under consideration. In<br>
the case when the operator torque request is greater than the torque deliverable<br>
by the driveline system, the point associated with an engine operating point<br><br>
(N1, P1 pairs for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) in the<br>
respective search space S or range associated with a potential transmission<br>
operating range state may be selected to be biased to a point at which the<br>
maximum output torque (To Max) of the transmission occurs for that potential<br>
transmission operating range state. Depending on the severity of the bias cost<br>
associated with the operator torque request, the selected point may or may not<br>
be that at which the maximum output torque occurs. Since the point selection<br>
is based on minimizing the total power loss where the bias cost associated<br>
with the output torque request is a component of, the larger the bias costs<br>
associated with the output torque request the more advantage there is to<br>
selecting the point at which the maximum output torque of the transmission<br>
occurs. The search space S or range for each potential transmission operating<br>
range state may be examined, such as by algorithm, and the point associated<br>
with an engine operating point at which the maximum output torque (To Max)<br>
of the transmission is biased to occur identified for each potential transmission<br>
operating range state. The points associated with the engine operating point<br>
at which the maximum output torque (To Max) of the transmission is biased to<br>
occur for each potential transmission operating range state are compared with<br>
one another to identify the potential transmission operating range state having<br>
the lowest power loss that is likely to have the highest To Max, which<br>
potential transmission operating range state is selected as being the preferred<br>
transmission operating range state when a vehicle operator makes a request for<br>
an acceleration torque, which is a torque request that tends to deliver more<br>
torque to the vehicle drive wheel(s) that are in contact with the road surface.<br><br>
[0080] Similarly, in the case when the operator torque request is less than the<br>
torque deliverable by the driveline system, the point associated with an engine<br>
operating point associated with a potential transmission operating range state<br>
may be selected to be biased to a point at which the minimum output torque<br>
(To Min) of the transmission occurs for that potential transmission operating<br>
range state. Depending on the severity of the bias cost associated with the<br>
operator torque request, the point selected may or may not be that at which the<br>
minimum output torque occurs. Since the point selection is based on<br>
minimizing the total power loss where the bias cost associated with the output<br>
torque request is a component of, the larger the bias costs associated with the<br>
output torque request the more advantage there is to selecting the point at<br>
which the minimum output torque of the transmission occurs. The search<br>
space S, or range for each potential transmission operating range state may be<br>
examined, such as algorithmically using a microprocessor, and the point<br>
associated with an N1 and P1 pair at which the minimum output torque (To<br>
Min) of the transmission is biased to occur identified for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state. The points associated with the engine<br>
operating point at which the minimum output torque (To Min) of the<br>
transmission is biased to occur for each potential transmission operating range<br>
state are compared with one another to identify the potential transmission<br>
operating range state having the lowest total power loss which is likely to have<br>
the lowest To Min, which potential transmission operating range state is<br>
selected as being the preferred transmission operating range state when a<br>
vehicle operator makes a request for an deceleration torque, which is a torque<br><br>
request that tends to deliver less torque to the vehicle drive wheel(s) that are in<br>
contact with the road surface.<br>
[0081] According to one embodiment of this disclosure, for cases of operator<br>
torque requests which command heavy vehicle acceleration (levels of<br>
acceleration for which the operator torque request is greater than that<br>
deliverable by the driveline system and the pre-determined bias cost associated<br>
with the output torque request is severe enough to overrule all other<br>
components of the total power loss), determining the engine operating point<br>
having the least power loss associated with them automatically results in<br>
determination of the N1 and P1 pair having the To Max, because the engine<br>
operating point having the highest To Max values associated with it, also has<br>
the smallest power losses associated with it. The converse is true for cases of<br>
operator torque requests which command vehicle deceleration.<br>
[0082] Hence, in a method according to an embodiment of the disclosure, an<br>
operator torque request is made during operation of a vehicle equipped with a<br>
system as herein described. A search engine executed by an on-board<br>
microprocessor chooses a first engine operating point from the search space S<br>
or range associated with a potential transmission operating range state. To<br>
Max and To Min values associated with that engine operating point in the<br>
search space S or range are calculated. Then, the power losses associated with<br>
that engine operating point in the respective search space S or range are<br>
calculated. As part of the total power loss calculation, the difference between<br>
the operator torque request and the To Max (or To Min, as may be applicable<br>
for cases where deceleration torque is requested) is assigned a biasing cost.<br>
This process is repeated for each engine operating point in the space S or<br><br>
range chosen by the search algorithm associated with that potential<br>
transmission operating range state, which results in a cost being associated<br>
with each chosen engine operating point in the respective search space S or<br>
range associated with that potential transmission operating range state. The<br>
points having the lowest biasing costs are inherently inclined to have the<br>
highest To Max and lowest To Min values.<br>
[0083] Thus, a method according to the disclosure is concerned with<br>
balancing selection of a transmission operating range state from a set of<br>
potential transmission operating range states between choosing engine<br>
operating point (N1. P1 pair for continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed<br>
gears, with emphasis on the N1 value, which is used for creating a desired<br>
transmission input profile as earlier described herein) in the respective search<br>
space S or range which have the least power losses of the system associated<br>
with each potential transmission operating range state, which includes a bias<br>
cost that biases the point selection to a point which has the highest To Max,<br>
(or lowest To Min). Preference in some embodiments may be given to those<br>
engine operating point within the respective search space S or range for the<br>
various potential transmission operating range states which have the absolute<br>
least total power losses, which includes large bias costs associated with the<br>
output torque request, which in such instance is more concerned with meeting<br>
an extreme torque request from the operator. In other embodiments,<br>
preference may be given to those engine operating points (N1, P1 pairs for<br>
continuously variable modes and T1 for fixed gears) within the respective<br>
search space S or range for the various potential transmission operating range<br>
states which have the absolute least total power losses, which include none or<br><br>
small bias costs associated with the output torque request, as this is an instance<br>
wherein it is desired to focus less on attempting to meet the extreme torque<br>
demand of the driver, and more on overall system efficiency. The choice<br>
between whether preference is given to system performance to meet the<br>
operator extreme torque demand as closely as possible, or to maximize the<br>
overall system efficiency is controllable by altering the function which<br>
determines the shape of the biasing costs curve shown in FIG. 11. When the<br>
slope of the curve defined by the function therein is selected to be steeper,<br>
more weight is given to meeting the operator torque request that is higher or<br>
lower than the torque output deliverable by the driveline.<br>
[0084] Once a method of the disclosure has been used to identify which<br>
potential transmission operating range state is to be selected, the transmission<br>
input speed N1 that was the basis for the selection of that particular<br>
transmission operating range state is used as the transmission input speed for<br>
continuously variable modes.<br>
[0085] In a further embodiment, including a Torque Reserve, the range of<br>
operator torque requests over which the biasing cost function which<br>
establishes the Torque Reserve is variable. This is of benefit since increasing<br>
the Torque Reserve reduces the tendency of the transmission system to cause<br>
multiple shifting events and abrupt changes in input speed profiles which<br>
would otherwise occur frequently when the transmission operating point is<br>
near the point where the maximum deliverable output torque can be produced<br>
for the potential transmission operating range state. Decreasing the Torque<br>
Reserve enables the system to operate closer to the point where the maximum<br>
deliverable output torque can be produced for the potential transmission<br><br>
operating range state when needed. Accordingly, varying the Torque Reserves<br>
for different driving conditions enables the flexibility of weighting the<br>
preference between improving drivability (reducing multiple transmission<br>
shifting events and input speed stabilization), and improving acceleration<br>
performance at high torque requests for each potential transmission operating<br>
range state for different driving conditions. In one embodiment, a change in<br>
the range of operator torque requests over which the biasing costs function that<br>
establishes the Torque Reserve operates is selectable by means of a tow / haul<br>
mode switch, which may be switched manually by the operator, or<br>
automatically by the electronic control module in response to an action of the<br>
operator, or by electronically sensing the position of the accelerator pedal and<br>
appropriately processing the signal information to switch between such<br>
modalities. This is illustrated diagrammatically in FIG. 14, wherein the switch<br>
permits selection of either a first Torque Reserve value (width or span along<br>
the abscissa axis) associated with times in the operation when it is used for<br>
towing / hauling; a second Torque Reserve value associated with normal<br>
vehicle operation which does not involve towing or hauling; or a third Torque<br>
Reserve value of zero, associated with times in operation when the extremely<br>
high accelerator pedal position (for example, about 95% of full pedal range)<br>
indicates that Torque Reserve is not needed to increase performance to meet a<br>
torque request having a relatively high magnitude. In a further embodiment, a<br>
switch algorithm can be pre-set with differing ordering of priorities of which<br>
Torque Reserve to select when multiple criteria are met, the choice of which<br>
exact priorities and criteria are within the selection of the vehicle engineers.<br><br>
[0086] The variability of the range of operator torque requests over which<br>
the biasing cost function which establishes the Torque Reserve operates is<br>
illustrated for one embodiment by comparing the range of operator torque<br>
requests over which the biasing cost function which establishes the Torque<br>
Reserve shown in FIG. 15, with that of FIG. 16. In FIG. 15, the range of<br>
operator torque requests over which the biasing cost function which<br>
establishes the Torque Reserve operates is wider than the range of operator<br>
torque requests over which the biasing cost function which establishes the<br>
Torque Reserve operates in FIG. 16. FIG. 17 illustrates a biasing cost function<br>
in which the Torque Reserve value is zero, i.e., there is no Torque Reserve. In<br>
one embodiment, the range of operator torque requests over which the biasing<br>
cost function which establishes the Torque Reserve operates for towing /<br>
hauling service is about 100 Newton-meters. In one embodiment, the range of<br>
operator torque requests over which the biasing cost function which<br>
establishes the Torque Reserve operates for non- towing / hauling service, or<br>
normal vehicle operation, is about 50 Newton-meters. In one embodiment, the<br>
range of operator torque requests over which the biasing cost function which<br>
establishes the Torque Reserve operates for conditions when monitored pedal<br>
position are high, is zero Newton-meters.<br>
[0087] In a further embodiment, the range of operator torque requests over<br>
which the biasing cost function which establishes the Torque Reserve operates<br>
is variable, based on the transmission output speed No, and the function used<br>
to determine the variability may be any function selected by a vehicle<br>
engineer. In one non-limiting embodiment, the function is linear, of the form<br>
y = ax + b.<br><br>
[0088] In a further embodiment, the range of operator torque requests over<br>
which the biasing cost function which establishes the Torque Reserve operates<br>
is variable, either linear or non-linear, based on the position of the accelerator<br>
pedal.<br>
[0089] In a further embodiment, the range of operator torque requests over<br>
which the biasing cost function which establishes the Torque Reserve operates<br>
is variable, either linear or non-linear, based on the rate of change of position<br>
of the accelerator pedal.<br>
[0090] One or more biasing cost functions may be stored in computer<br>
memory disposed on-board the motorized vehicle. In one embodiment, the<br>
function used for providing the biasing costs associated with operator torque<br>
requests is the same for all potential transmission operating range states. In<br>
another embodiment, the function used for providing the biasing costs<br>
associated with operator torque requests is different for at least two of the<br>
potential transmission operating range states considered in making a selection<br>
between which operating range states are to be considered desirable or<br>
employed at a given time during vehicle operation. In one embodiment of this<br>
disclosure, the function used for providing the biasing costs associated with<br>
operator torque requests in a transmission operating range state is considered<br>
in making a selection of an engine operating point (especially the input speed<br>
selection in continuously variable modes) considered desirable or employed at<br>
a given time during vehicle operation. Calculation of values of biasing costs<br>
based on the biasing cost function(s) and operator torque request(s) is a routine<br>
matter and in one embodiment is carried out in an on-board microprocessor,<br>
the results of the calculations being stored in on-board computer memory.<br><br>
[0091] It is understood that modifications are allowable within the scope of<br>
the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>
