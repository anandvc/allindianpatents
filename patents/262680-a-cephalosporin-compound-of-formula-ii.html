DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides novel glycopeptide - cephalosporin compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof.   These compounds have multiple chiral centers and, in this regard, the compounds are intended to have the stereochemistry shown. In particular, the glycopeptide portion of the compound is intended to have the stereochemistry of the corresponding naturally-occurring glycopeptide (i.e., vancomycin, chloroorienticin A and the like). The cephalosporin portion of the molecule is intended to have the stereochemistry of known cephalosporin compounds. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that minor amounts of isomers having a different stereochemistry from that shown may be present in the compositions of this invention provided that the utility of the composition as a whole is not significantly diminished by the presence of such isomers,<br>
Additionally, the linking portion of the compounds of this invention (i.e., R1) may contain one or more chiral centers. Typically, this portion of the molecule will be prepared as a racemic mixture. If desired, however, pure stereoisomers (i.e., individual enantiomers or diastereomers) may be used or a stereoisomer-enriched mixture can be employed. All such stereoisomers and enriched mixtures are included within the scope of this invention.<br>
In addition, compounds of this invention contain several acidic groups (i.e., carboxylic acid groups) and several basic groups (i.e., primary and secondary amine groups) and therefore, the compounds of formula I can exist in various salt forms. All such salt forms are included within the scope of this invention. Also, since the compounds of formula I contain a pyridinium ring, an anionic counterion for the pyridinium group may optionally be present including, but not limited to, halides, such as chloride; carboxyJates, such as acetate; and the like.<br>
Furthermore, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that, labile or chemically unstable compounds which lack any utility due to their instability are not included within the scope of this invention. For example, it is preferred that compounds of formula I contain at least two carbon atoms between any oxygen<br><br>
(-0-), nitrogen (-N

The following synthesis is illustrated, in part, in Scheme A above.<br>
Step 1 ~ Preparation of Ai(7erNButoxvcarbonvlV3-bromopropylamine (i.e. Compound 4 where R1 is -(CH-Â»)3-. R2 is hydrogen. R11 is BOC. and Z1 is bromo)<br>
3-Bromopropylamine hydrobromide (100 g, 457 mmol) was suspended in 1.6 L of anhydrous THF. This mixture was cooled to 0Â°C in an ice/water bath and stirred vigorously while 190 mL of triethylamine was added. To this mixture was added dropwise te/t-butoxycarbonyl anhydride (112.6 g, 516 mmol) in 200 mL THF. The ice bath was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and the mixture was stirred overnight at which time TLC indicated the reaction was complete. The mixture was then filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The residual oil was diluted with 1500 mL hexane and stored at -20Â°C for 3 days. The mixture was then decanted and the residual solid was dried under vacuum to give 101 g (94% yield) of the title intermediate as a crystalline white solid.<br>
'HNMR (DMSO-d6&gt; 300 MHz): 8 1.35-1.39 (s, 9H), 1.91-1.95 (m, 2H), 2.99-3.04 (t, 2H), 3.43-3.52 (t, 2H), 6.95-6.99 (t, 1H).<br>
Step 2 - Preparation of Ethyl (2)-2-f2-Triphenvlmethylaminothiazol-4-vl)-2-G-JV-BOC-aminopropoxyimino'tocetate (i.e. ethvl ester of Compound 5a where R1 is -TCHA-, R2 is hydrogen, R9 is triphenvlmethvl. Ru is BOC. and A is hydrogen)<br>
Ethyl (Z)-2-(2-triphenylmethylamino)thiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate hydrochloride (100 g, 202.4 mmol) was dissolved in 700 mL of anhydrous DMF. To this stirred mixture was added cesium carbonate (230.8 g, 708.5 mmol) followed by tetrabutylammonium iodide (18.7 g, 50.6 mmol). N-BOC-3-bromopropylamine (50.6 g, 212.5 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) was then added dropwise over 30 minutes. The mixture was stirred for two hours at which time HPLC indicated that the reaction was<br><br>
complete. The mixture was then filtered and the filter cake was washed with 200 mL of DMF. The filtrate was dissolved in 2 L of ethyl acetate and washed with 700 mL of IN HCl, followed by 700 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and finally with 500 mL of brine. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The residual oil was dissolved in 250 mL of boiling ethanol and poured into a beaker. Once the material had completely cooled, the residual clay-like solid was placed in a Biichner funnel and washed with 50 mL of ethanol previously cooled to -20Â°C (NOTE: the product is moderately soluble in ethanol and use of larger amounts will decrease the overall yield of final product).<br>
After air-drying, the residual solid was ground into a fine powder in a mortar and<br>
pestle and dried under vacuum to give 117 g (94% yield) of the title intermediate as a<br>
fine off-white powder.<br>

Step 3 - Preparation of ('Z)'2-f2-Triphenvlmethvlaminothia2ol-4-vl)-2-r3-A^-BOC-aminopropoxyimino)acetate (i.e, Compound 5a where R1 is -fCH2)3-Â« R2 is hvdrogen, R9 is triphenvlmethvl R11 is BOC, and A is hydrogen)<br>
The ethyl ester from Step 2 above (84.2 g, 137 mmol) was suspended in 400 mL of anhydrous ethanol and heated in an oil bath to 80Â°C with stirring. After all material had dissolved, potassium hydroxide (23.1 g, 411 mmol) in 150 mL of ethanol was added dropwise to the solution over 20 minutes. A precipitate began forming 10 minutes after addition of the base was complete, and within another 10 minutes the mixture was solid. The mixture was removed from the oil bath and cooled in an ice bath. Ethvl acetate and water were added to the cooled mixture which was then poured into a separatory funnel. The mixture was washed with IN phosphoric acid, which caused the formation of a white solid (NOTE: washing the product with a stronger acid, such as IN HCl causes degradation of the product). Water was added to<br><br>
the separatory funnel to dissolve this solid, and the organic layer was then washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and with brine. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum to give the title intermediate (80 g, 99% yield) as a dark tan solid.<br>
Step 4 - Preparation of (Z)-2-r2-Triphenvlmethvlamino-5-chlorothiazol-4-yl)-2-(3-A^BOC-aminopropoxvimino)acetate (i.e. Compound 5b where R1 is ~(CH2)3-. R2 is hydrogen. R9 is triphenvlmethvl. R11 is BOC, and A is chloro)<br>
The intermediate from Step 3 above (10 g, 17.04 mmol) was dissolved in 70 mL of chloroform and stirred while solid A^-chlorosuccinimde (2.28 g, 17.04 mmol) was added (NOTE: experiments suggest that excess NCS may produce undesired side products). The mixture was stirred overnight (a minimum of 15 hours) at which time HPLC indicated that the reaction was complete. The mixture was then concentrated under vacuum and the residue was dissolved in a minimal amount of DMF. This mixture was added to vigorously stirred water to form a precipitate which was then collected by filtration. The solid was air-dried to give 9.5 g (90% yield) of the title intermediate as a tan solid, 1HNMR indicated only a minimal amount of succinimide remaining (NOTE: isolation of chlorinated product is not necessary for successful coupling in next step, but experiments suggest that residual succinimide may interfere with subsequent pyridine displacement). Alternatively, after the chlorination reaction â–ºvas complete, the reaction mixture was washed with water (3x), brine, and then dried )ver anhydrous sodium sulfate. This solution was then filtered and concentrated mder vacuum to give the title intermediate (90%) as a tan solid.<br>

The intermediate from Step 4 (0.62 g, 1 mmol) was dissolved in 6 mL of anhydrous THF, and to this mixture was added 0.34 g (0.83 mmol) of 7-amino-3-chloromethylcephalosporanic acid/?-methoxybenzyl ester hydrochloride (i.e, compound 6 where R12 is PMB; obtained from Otsuka, Japan) in 4 mL of anhydrous THF. The resulting mixture was stirred under nitrogen and cooled to -35Â°C. To this cooled mixture was added diisopropylethylamine (0*52 mL, 3mmol) followed by phosphorous oxychloride (0.11 mL, 1.2 mmol). This mixture was stirred at -20Â°C for 30 minutes and then quenched with wet THF and diluted with ethyl acetate. This mixture was washed with water, IN HCl, brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give 0.88 g (100% yield) of the title intermediate as a brown-red solid. !HNMR indicated no undesired isomerization and no residual succinimide.<br>

(NOTE: Experiments suggest that DIPEA causes isomerization when the above reaction is carried out on larger scales. A modified procedure which uses 2,4,6-collidine as the base and which maintains the temperature at -35Â°C for the entire course of the reaction - about 10 minutes - avoids this problem).<br><br>

Example 35 Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs)<br>
Minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) assays were performed using the broth microdilution method set forth in NCCLS guidelines (see, NCCLS. 2000. Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard - Fifth Ed., Vol. 20, No. 2). Bacterial strains were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC), Stanford University Hospital (SU), Kaiser Permanente Regional Laboratory in Berkeley (KPB), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the San Francisco Veterans' Administration Hospital (SFVA) or the University of California San Francisco Hospital (UCSF). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were phenotyped as Van A or Van B based on their sensitivity to teicoplanin. Some vancomycin-resistant enterococci that had been genotyped as Van A, Van B, Van CI or Van C2 were also obtained from the Mayo Clinic.<br>
In this assay, cryopreserved bacterial cultures of reference and clinical strains were streaked for isolation on appropriate agar medium (i.e., Trypticase Soy Agar, Trypticase Soy Agar with defibrinated sheep erthrocytes, Brain Heart Infusion Agar, Chocolate Agar). Following incubation to allow formation of colonies, these plates were sealed with parafilm and stored refrigerated for up to two weeks. For preparation of assay inocula and to ensure low variability, several colonies from a<br><br>
bacterial isolate cultured on the agar plates were pricked with an inoculating loop and aseptically transferred to Mueller-Hinton Broth (supplemented with divalent cations to required levels based on manufacturer's certification). The broth culture was grown overnight at 35Â°C, diluted in fresh prewarmed broth and grown to log phase; this is equivalent to a 0.5 MacFarland standard or 1 x 108 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Not all cell suspensions, due to species variability, contained 1 x 108 CFU/mL when turbidity is equivalent to the MacFarland standard, therefore acceptable adjustments (based on NCCLS guidelines) were made in dilutions of different bacterial strains. The inoculum was diluted such that 100 \xL of this culture in Mueller-Hinton Broth, supplemented Mueller-Hinton Broth, or Haemophilus test medium, when over layered onto a 2-fold serially diluted series of antibiotic concentrations also in 100 \xL of corresponding medium, in a 96-well microtiter plate resulted in a starting bacterial concentration of 5 x 105 CFU/mL. The plates were then incubated 18-24 hours at 35Â°C. The MIC was read visually as the lowest concentration well with no bacterial growth. Bacterial growth is defined as more than three pinpoint colonies, a button of precipitated cells larger than 2 mm in diameter, or obvious turbidity.<br>
Strains routinely tested in the initial screen included methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus producing penicillinase, methicillin-sensistive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecium (EFMVS), vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (EFSVS), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium also resistant to teicoplanin (EFMVR Van A), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium sensistive to teicoplanin (EFMVR Van B), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis also resistant to teicoplanin (EFS VR Van A), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to teicoplanin (EFSVR Van B), penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSRP). Because of the inability of PSSP and PSRP to<br><br>
grow well in Mueller-Hinton broth, MICs with those strains were determined using either TS broth supplemented with defibrinated blood or Haemophilus test medium.<br>
Test compounds having significant activity against the strains mentioned above were then tested for MIC values in a larger panel of clinical isolates including the species listed above as well as non-speciated coagulase negative Staphylococcus both sensitive and resistant to methicillin (MS-CNS and MR-CNS). Additionally, these test compounds were also assayed for MICs against gram-negative microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Psetidomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.<br>

2	Minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains tested.<br>
Additionally, as shown in Table III, compounds of this invention also had surprising and unexpected MICs against various methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains #hen compared to a related des-chloro derivative (i.e., Compound 34).<br><br><br>
Example 36 Time-Kill Assay<br>
This time-kill assay is a method for measuring the rate of bactericidal activity of a test compound. These procedures are similar to those described in V, Lorian, "Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine", Fourth Edition, Williams and Wilkins (1996), pages 104-105. A rapid time-kill is desirable to quickly prevent bacterial colonization and reduce host tissue damage.<br>
Bacterial inocula were prepared as described in Example 35 for determination of MIC. Bacteria were diluted in prewarmed media in shake flasks and incubated with shaking (200 rpm, 35Â°C). At 0,1,4, and 24 hours samples were withdrawn from<br><br>
the flasks and bacteria were enumerated by plate counting. Subsequent to the initial sampling, a compound to be assayed was added to the shake flask culture. Plate counts at these intervals previous to and following addition of the compound were expressed graphically in a time-kill curve. Bactericidal activity is defined as a &gt;3 log decrease (reduction greater than or equal to 99.9%) in bacterial cell numbers by 24 hours.<br>
In this assay, a compound of formula I, i.e., Compound 1, was bactericidal against MSSA 13709 and MRSA 33591 at a concentration of 
Example 37 In v/w Efficacy Studies in Neutropenic Mice<br>
Animals (male CD-I mice, 20-30g) were acquired from Charles Rivers Laboratories (Gilroy, CA) and allowed access to food and water ad libitum. Neutropenia was induced via 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) injection of cyclophosphamide given four and two days prior to the inoculation of bacteria.<br>
The organism used was either a susceptible or resistant strain of clinically relevant gram positive pathogens, such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 13709) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA 33591). The bacterial inoculum concentration was -106 CFU/mL. Animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and 50 mL of the bacterial inoculum was injected into the anterior thigh. One hour after the inoculation, animals were dosed intravenously with vehicle or the appropriate dose of the test compound.  At 0 hours and 24 hours post-treatment, the animals were euthanized (C02 asphyxiation) and the anterior and posterior thigh collected aseptically. The thigh was placed into 10 mL sterile saline and homogenized. Dilutions of the homogenate were plated onto triptic soy agar plates which were incubated overnight. The number of bacterial colonies on a given plate was multiplied by the dilution factor, divided by the thigh weight (in<br><br>
grams) and expressed as log CFU/g, ED50 (dose required to produce 50% of the maximum reduction in thigh titre) was estimated for each test compound.<br>
In this assay using MRSA 33591, a compound of formula I, i.e., Compound 1, had an ED50 of 
Example 38 Determination of Aqueous Solubility<br>
The aqueous solubility of a compound of this invention was determined using the following procedure. A 5 wt. % dextrose buffer solution at pH 2.2 was prepared by adding 1 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid (Aldrich) to 99 mL of a 5 wt. % aqueous dextrose solution (Baxter).<br>
A 1 mg/mL stock solution for calibration standards was then prepared by dissolving 1 mg of the test compound in 1 mL of DMSO. This solution was vortexed for 30 seconds and then sonicated for 10 minutes. The stock solution was then diluted with water to prepare calibration standards having the following concentrations: 50, 125, 250, 375 and 500 ug/mL.<br>
Each test compound (30 mg) was weighed into a Millipore non-sterile, Ultrafree-MC 0.1 urn filter unit (Millipore UFC30VVOO) and a magnetic stir bar was added to each unit. The 5 wt. % dextrose buffer solution (750 uL) was then added to each unit and these mixtures were vortexed for 5 minutes. The filter units were then placed in an Eppendorf tube rack and the tube rack was placed on top of a magnetic stirrer. Each unit was then titrated to pH 3 using 1 N NaOH (VWR) and the resulting solutions centrifuged at 7000 rpms for 5 minutes. Each unit was then diluted 200 fold with 5% dextrose buffer solution and the diluted samples were transferred into auto sampler vials for analysis.<br>
The calibration standards and the test samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using the following conditions;<br><br>
Column:	Luna 150x4.6 mm; CI8; 5u<br>
Mobile phase;	A = 5/95, B = 95/5, both = MeCN/H20; 0.1 % TFA<br>
Method:	10m Lido 100 (0-100 % B in 6 min)<br>
Injection volume:	20 uL<br>
Wavelength:	214 nm<br>
The solubility of each test sample was calculated by comparing the peak area of the test sample to the calibration curve and multiplying by the dilution factor. Using the above procedure with duplicate sample preparations, Compound 1 was found to have a solubility of &gt;47.9 mg/mL.<br>
