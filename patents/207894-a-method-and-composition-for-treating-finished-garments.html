A METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR TREATING FINISHED GARMENTS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.	_<br><br>
27-11-2006<br><br><br>
2 7 NOV 20%<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to garment treatment compositions suitable for domestic use in a laundering process, and in particular to compositions which contain components which can cross-link with cellulose.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cellulose is a beta 1-4 linked polysaccharide and the principal component of cotton, which is a well-known material for the production of fabrics and in very widespread use.  Cellulose is capable of cross-linking by hydrogen bonds which form between the cellulose chains.<br>
The majority of garments purchased world-wide contain at least some cellulose fibres in the form of cotton or rayon and these suffer from the well-known problem that on exposure to water, such as during domestic laundering, fibre dimensions change and cause shrinking, shape change and wrinkling of the garments.  It is believed that this is due to release and reformation of hydrogen bonds.<br>
So-called 'durable press' treatments of fabrics are intended to overcome these difficulties.. One of the most common methods of durable pressing uses a crosslinking agent to immobilise cellulose at a molecular level.  Known cross-<br>
2<br><br>
linking agents for whole cloth include formaldehyde, and urea-glyoxal resins.  Other proposals include epichlorohydrins, vinyl sulphones, acrylo-amide and acrylo-acrylates.  None of these proposed technologies have demonstrated any commercial viability for domestic on finished garments use to date.<br>
A range of industrial processes for use in the manufacture of finished fabrics are known.<br>
US 4588761 discloses poly-urethane coating compositions for use with a transfer paper or other temporary support. These comprise an isocyanate which is preferably blocked. This is an industrial treatment process for fabric and is inherently unsuitable for use at home on finished garments.<br>
JP 53035098 discloses a finishing process for treating woven or knitted cellulosic fabrics with a processing solution comprising a urethane prepolymer with blocked terminal isocyanate groups, a gloxal-amide type cross-linking agent and a bromo-fluorinated metal. The process is not suitable for domestic application to finished garments.<br>
JP6346374 discloses finishing of fabric or a sewed product by a stepwise industrial process comprising treatment with a blocked isocyanate, heat treatment and subsequent use of a gas phase cross-linking agent. A similar process is disclosed in JP8127972.  .<br>
JP 55093882 discloses a method for flocked fabric production which uses masked isocyanate. JP 9316781 discloses a<br>
3<br><br>
finishing agent for use in the production of yarn, paper or films which comprises.a blocked isocyanate. JP 11131374 discloses an industrial process for the product of water repellent fabric by treatment with a glyoxal-based resin crosslinking agent, an organo-fluorine compound and a isocyanate based cross-linking agent. Followed by heat treatment for 0.5-5min. A. similar process is disclosed in JP 2000129573.<br>
An alternative proposal is to use poly-acids such as BTCA (butyl tetra carboxylic acid) or citric acid as crosslinking agents.  These can esterify with the -OH groups of the cellulose to form a covalent cross-link.  The covalent cross-link is not disrupted by water and this both prevents deformation of fabrics and assists return to a flat state. One of the difficulties with'this approach is that a sodium hypophosphite catalyst is generally used to cause the esterification reaction to proceed and the treated articles require heat curing.  Moreover, these poly-acid materials are highly water soluble and are difficult to deposit on fabrics.<br>
A preferred durable press system suitable for domestic use should be a non-toxic, one component, catalyst-free system with low iron-cure times, have some affinity for the fabric surface and not cause fabric strength losses. It should also avoid the need for specialised equipment and the use of use of difficult materials such as vapour-phase formaldehyde.<br>
4<br><br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
We have determined that excellent cross-linking benefits can be obtained by treating finished garments with a cellulose cross-linking agent that is thermally activated.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating finished garments comprising cellulosic material so as to cause cross-linking, which comprises the step of treating fabrics with an effective amount of a blocked cross-linking agent for cellulose, said cross-linking agent being thermally activated.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term 'thermally activated' is intended to mean that the cross-linking agent is 'blocked' to prevent reaction until the cross-linking agent is activated by the application of heat. In order to achieve cross-linking is preferable that at least two reactive sites of the cross-linking agents are blocked with a thermally labile blocking group.<br>
Preferably the blocked cross-linking sites are selected such that, when activated, they are readily capable of reacting with hydroxy groups present in cellulose. More preferably the cross-linking reaction forms an   xester' linkage, which in the context of the present invention includes linkages where the alpha carbon of the ester is replaced by a hetero-atom, preferably nitrogen. In the case of the alpha-carbon being so replaced the molecule is formally known as a carbamate.<br>
5<br><br>
Ideally, the reaction proceeds without the requirement for a catalyst. Catalysts can optionally be present. Suitable catalysts are selected depending on the particular blocking chemistry employed and, for example, include, pH modification agents and/or metal ions.<br>
Preferably the cross-linking agent is bi-functional.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the cross-linking agent is an at least bi-functional blocked polycarboxylic acid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the cross linking agent is an at least bi-functional blocked isocyanate.<br>
By 'bi-functional' is meant that there are at least two blocked groups which can act as cross linking sites. Preferably, both of these are either blocked isocyanates or blocked carboxylic acids.<br>
Preferably the blocked carboxylic acid is an ester with relatively weak ester bonds which can trans-esterify with cellulose.  This is accomplished by forming the polyester between a poly-carboxylic acid and an alcohol (which term includes phenol) which is a good leaving group. The alcohols act as thermally labile 'blocking agents' for the carboxylic acid groups.  Essentially the same result can be obtained by the use of carboxylic acid/imide linkages.<br>
6<br><br>
The present invention provides a method.of treating finished garments comprising cellulosic materials so as to cause cross-linking which comprises the step of transesterifying the cellulosic material with an effective amount of an at least bi-functional blocked polycarboxylic acid.<br>
Preferably said blocked polycarboxylic acid is blocked with an electron-withdrawing alcohol or imide.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of treating finished garments comprising cellulosic materials so as  to cause cross-linking which comprises the step of treating finished garments comprising cellulosic material with an effective amount of an at least bi-functional blocked isocyanate.<br>
In the present invention the treatment is conducted as part of a domestic laundering operation applied to finished garments.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
composition for use in the methods described above.<br>
Preferably, said composition will comprise a cross-linking agent which forms an ester linkage with the cellulose.<br>
Preferably the cross-linking agent comprises either a blocked poly isocyanate or blocked poly carboxylic acid and which is thermally activated.<br>
7<br><br>
Preferably, the method of the invention comprises the step of curing the treated materials by heat treatment at a temperature of from 50 to 250C, more preferably at a temperature of from 100-200C.<br>
More preferably, the method of the present invention further comprises the step of curing the treated materials by<br><br>
obtained by ironing after treatment is surprising.<br>
Advantageously, the present method may be performed in the absence of vapour-phase formaldehyde and other components known from the prior art which are unsuitable for domestic use.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As noted above the cellulose cross-linking agent can be a polycarboxylic acid or a blocked isocyanate. Preferred embodiments of each of these alternatives are discussed in further detail below.<br>
In some embodiments the backbone of the cross-linking agent is polymeric in character, by which is meant that it comprises repeating structures. Typically, the backbone comprises a sufficiently long polymeric structure (preferably 2-12 carbon-carbon bond lengths) to fulfil its function as a bridging structure between the two or more reactive groups.<br><br><br>
A.   Blocked Polycarboxylicacids:     <br>
Polyesters suitable for use in the present invention comprise a polycarboxylic acid esterified with a xleaving' group which is an alcohol or an imide. The polycarboxylic acid preferably has 2-6 carboxyl groups available for esterification. Typically each of the carboxyl groups will be esterified to produce a polyester.<br>
Most preferably, the polycarboxylic acid has two carbonyl groups available for esterification and typically these are at opposite ends of an essentially linear polycarboxylic acid. In a preferred embodiment the polyester takes the form:<br>
R1O-CO-L-CO-OR2<br>
Where R1O- and -OR2 are the same or different alcohol residues, and  -CO-L-CO- is the residue of the polycarboxylic acid. L is a linking group, which may be substituted, and generally comprises  a 2-12 carbon backbone.<br>

Particularly preferred alcohols include trichlorophenol, isoeuginol, vanillin, 4-cyanophenol, ethyl salicylate, 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, 4-aminophenol and dimethylamino phenol. As noted above, imides can also be used as the 'alcohol'.<br>
A preferred imide material is N-hydroxysuccinimide.<br>
The alcohol leaving group can have functional properties which give it some utility after the transesterification reaction.  One such property is that of a perceptible odour. For example, a notable odour of cloves is obtained with weak isoeuginol esters upon the application of heat (i.e. on ironing).  This can act as a useful cue to the user that the reaction is proceeding.<br>
Preferred polyesters include the.trichlorophenol diester of succinic acid, the trichlorophenol diester of BTCA, the N-hydroxysuccinimide diester of succinic acid, the isoeugenol diester of succinic acid, and the vanillin diester of succinic acid.<br>
The polyester will typically only have one type of alcohol present, although it is possible to envisage 'mixed' esters in which two or more, different types of alcohol are present.<br>
16<br><br>
It is particularly preferred that the polyester has a molecular weight below 1500 Dalton.  It is believed that the cellulosic materials will stiffen if larger molecular weight materials are used.<br>
While the polyester can be applied from a non-aqueous solvent (such as THF) it is preferable to apply the material from a wholly or partly aqueous solvent.<br>
B.   Blocked Polyisocyanates:<br>
In another class of embodiments of the invention the treatment agent is a blocked isocyanate.<br>
Blocked isocyanate is described at length and defined in 'Progress in Organic Coatings' 36 (1999) 148-172.<br>
Preferably, but not exclusively, the blocked isocyanate is chemically blocked. Such molecules include materials which are derived from isocyanate compounds by reaction with an active hydrogen compound. However, it is also known to produce blocked isocyanate via other routes not involving the reaction of an isocyanate, these are still known in the art as blocked isocyanate. Similarly, while cross-linking most reactions of the blocked isocyanate will generate an isocyanate as an intermediate, reaction schemes have been suggested in which the blocked isocyanate reacts without the formation of such an intermediate. It is also known that isocyanate can form thermally unstable dimers or higher polymeric forms, generally known as 'uretdiones' these are<br>
17<br><br>
also considered to be examples of blocked isocyanate for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
As suitable polycarboxylic acids and 'blocking' alcohols were described above, so suitable polyisocyanates and blocking groups are described below.<br>

Also envisaged as suitable are biuret-isocyanurate- or urethane-group-containing modification products of the above mentioned simple polyisocyanates, for example tris-(6-isocyanatohexyl)-biuret and its higher homologs; polyisocyanates containing isocyanurate groups obtainable by the trimerisation of aliphatic and/or aromatic diisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, especially tri-(6-isocyanatohexyl)-isocyanurate<br>
Polyisocyanates formed by the reaction of an excess of diisocyanate with polyhydric alcohols followed by the removal of unreacted diisocyanate excess by distillation.<br>
Examples of simple polyhydric alcohols include:<br>

Hexamethylene diisocyanate is a particularly preferred isocyanate for use in the present invention.<br>
Polyisocyanate Blocking Agents:<br>
These are analogous to the thermally-labile alcohol blocking agents used for the esters and described above. As in the case of the preferred materials described for blocking esters the blocking agents for the isocyanates can also be phenols. As noted above the isocyanates generally react with cellulose to form carbamates, which are considered examples of the more general class of esters. It is believed that some isocyanates, will however react to form 'true' esters.<br><br><br>
Preferred phenols again have electron withdrawing substituents in the ortho and/or para position relative to the alcoholic proton.<br>
Oximes, (an oxime is formed by the reaction of hydroxylamine<br>
with a carbonyl compound) can be used to block isbcyanates.<br>
Examples of suitable ketones that form oximes by reaction<br>
-	:	<br>
Tetramethylcyclobutanedione<br>
Methyl n-amyl ketone<br>
Methyl isoamyl ketone<br>
Methyl 3-ethylheptyl ketone<br>
Methyl 2,4-dimethylpentyl ketone<br>

Secondary and especially hindered amines can be used to block isocyanates.<br>
Suitable active methylene blocking agents include:<br>
diethyl malonate<br>
t-butyl methyl malonate<br><br>
Ethyl acetoacetate t-butyl acetoacetate<br>
Particularly preferred blocking agents are Meldrum's Acid, Phenol, 4-Nitrophenol, 4-Methoxyphenol, and/or Methyl Salicylate. The most preferred blocking agents are diethyl malonate, succinimide and sodium bisulphite.<br>
Both the isocyanates and the carboxylic acids  described above can be mono-blocked by reaction of only one of the characteristic reactive groups by a suitable blocking agent. The remaining free reactive group(s) can then be reacted with a bi-functional further linking group (such as a polyol or polyamine) to form blocked structures which (taking the mono-blocked acids and a diol as an example) have the form:<br>
R1O-CO-L1-CO-OMO-CO-L2-CO-OR2<br>
Where :<br>
RiO- and -OR2 are the same or different alcohol residues,<br>
24<br><br>
-CO-LI-CO- and -CO-L2-CO- are the same or different residue of polycarboxylic acid, and, -0M0- is the residue of the polyol.<br>
Similar structures can be prepared from the isocyanates.<br>
Methods of forming mono-blocked isocyanates include blocking of diisocyanates where each isocyanate group has a different reactivity thus one or more groups become preferentially blocked. Alternatively, the blocking agent can be added to a large excess of diisocyanate and the unreacted diisocyanate removed by distillation upon completion of blocking. Similar considerations apply to esters.<br>
Reaction of the mono-blocked cross-linking agent with either a polyol or polyamine can involve either reaction with all the available hydroxy or amine groups to give a 100% modified polyol or polyamine.<br>
By controlling the amount of mono-blocked cross-linking added, structures with both modified and unmodified hydroxy and amine groups can be formed. Such structures are capable of self-crosslinking upon removal of the blocking groups.<br>
Suitable polyols include those found among the alcohols described previously as being suitable for blocking isocyanates or carboxylic acids.<br>
25<br><br>
Particularly preferred polyols  are:<br>
Sugars   such  as   sorbitol,   mannitol,   xylose,    fructose, galactose,   mannose,   glucose,   altrose,   lactose,   cellobiose, sucrose,<br>
Oligo  and polysaccharides,   preferentially  p-l,4-linked oligo-   and polysaccharides.<br>
â	<br>
derivatives, or other polysaccharides which have	the ability<br>
to recognise cellulose, example of which include	locus bean<br>
gum and guar gum.<br>
Suitable polyamines include:<br>
Diethylenetriamine<br>
N-(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-propanediamine<br>
3,3' -diamino-N-methyldipropylamine<br>
N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-propanediamine<br>

4,7,10-trioxa-l,13-tridecanediamine<br>
Glycerol tris(poly(propylene glycol)amine terminated) ether<br>
Chitosan<br>
Optionally, unreacted amino groups can be rendered cationic by modification with quaternerising agents such as methyl iodide, dimethyl sulphate and the like. Such cationic modification improves the substantivity of the materials.<br>
2 6<br><br>
By use of a secondary linking group 'M' which can recognise (as in the case of polysaccharides) or otherwise bind (as in the case of the cationics) to a cellulosic substrate the efficiency of deposition of the cross-linking agents can be significantly improved.<br>
Carriers and Product Form:<br>
Compositions of the present invention are preferably formulated into fabric care compositions comprising a solution, dispersion or emulsion comprising a cross-linking agent.<br>
The compositions of the invention will generally comprise a textile compatible carrier.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term "textile compatible carrier" includes a component which can assist in the interaction of the cellulose cross-liking agent with a textile.  The carrier can be a simply a solvent for the cross-linking agent, although the carrier can also provide benefits in addition to those provided by the cross-linking agent e.g. softening, cleaning etc.  Preferably, the carrier is a detergent-active compound or a textile softener or conditioning compound or a detergent.<br>
If the composition is to be used in a laundry process as part of a conventional fabric treatment product, such as a rinse conditioner or main wash product, it is preferable if the level of cross-linking agent is from 0.01% to 10%, more<br><br><br>
preferably 0.05% to 7.5%, most preferably 0.1 to 5wt% of the total composition.<br>
If, however, the composition is to be used in a laundry process as a product to specifically treat the fabric to reduce creasing, higher levels of cross-linking agent can be used. Preferred amounts are from 0.01% to 15%, more preferably 0.05% to 10%, for example from 0.1 to 7.5wt% of the total composition.<br>
If the composition is to be used in a spray product it is preferred that the level of cross-linking agent is from 0.5 to 20 wt%, preferably I to 20 wt% of the total composition.<br>
As noted above, the method of the invention generally comprises the step of applying a composition of the cross-linking agent to garments and curing the composition, preferably by ironing.  The composition may be applied to the fabric by conventional methods such as dipping, spraying or soaking, for example.<br>
The fabric care composition of the invention preferably comprises a solution, dispersion or emulsion comprising a cross-linking agent  and a textile compatible carrier.  The textile compatible carrier facilitates contact between the fabric and the ingredients of the composition. The textile compatible carrier may be water or a surfactant. However, when it is water, it is preferred that a perfume is present.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the composition may be provided in a form suitable for spraying onto a<br>
28<br><br>
fabric.  The fabric may then be dried, e.g. in a tumble dryer, and then ironed to cure the composition.<br>
If this is the case, it is preferred that the polycarboxylic acid or derivative thereof is present at a level from 0.5 to 20wt%, preferably 0.5 to 10wt%, of the total composition. If the product is to be used in a spray on product it is also beneficial if wetting agents are also present such as alcohol ethoxylates for example, Synperonic A7.<br>
For a spray on formulation anionic surfactants may be present.<br>
Suitable spray dispensing devices are disclosed in WO 96/15310 (Procter &amp; Gamble) and are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the composition may be applied through the irons water tank, a separate reservoir or a spray cartridge in an iron, as described in EP1201816 and WO 99/27176.<br>
Spray products may contain water and/or other solvents as a carrier molecule.<br>
It is particularly advantageous, and surprising, that the composition can be cured by ironing, even under domestic conditions.  Moreover, a steam iron can be used, which is desirable to aid wrinkle removal, with no deleterious effects on the curing process.<br>
29<br><br>
A further advantage of the method of the invention is that, when the composition is applied as a spray, one application is sufficient to obtain benefits after subsequent washes.<br>
In a washing process, as part of a conventional textile washing product, such as a detergent composition, the textile-compatible carrier will typically be a detergent-is a rinse conditioner, the textile-compatible carrier will be a textile softening and/or conditioning compound. These â are described in further, detail below.<br>
The cross-linking agent can be used to treat the textile in the wash cycle of a laundering process.  The cross-linking agent can also be used in the rinse cycle, or, preferably applied prior to or during ironing and/or pressing.<br>
The composition'of the invention may be in the form of a liquid, solid (e.g. powder or tablet), a gel or paste, spray, stick or a foam or mousse.  Examples include a soaking product, a rinse treatment (e.g. conditioner or finisher) or a main-wash product.  Spray products are particularly suited to application as part of an ironing or pressing process.<br>
Liquid compositions may also include an agent which produces a pearlescent appearance, e.g. an organic pearlising compound' such as ethylene glycol distearate, or inorganic pearlising pigments such as microfine mica or titanium<br>
dioxide (Ti02) coated mica.. Liquid compositions may be in<br>
the form of emulsions or emulsion precursors thereof.<br>
30<br><br>
Detergent Active Compounds:<br>
If the composition of the present invention is itself in the form of a detergent composition, the textile-compatible carrier may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Many suitable detergent active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and'II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred textile-compatible carriers that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and nonionic compounds.<br>
Anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art.  Examples include alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl<br>
chain length of Cs-Cis; primary and secondary alkylsulphates,<br>
particularly Cs-Cis primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether<br>
sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
Nonionic surfactants that may be used include the primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates, especially the C8-C20 aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to<br>
31<br><br>
20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and more<br>
especially the C10-C15 primary and secondary aliphatic<br>
alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.  Non-ethoxylated nonionic surfactants include alkylpolyglycosides, glycerol monoethers, and polyhydroxyamides (glucamide).<br>
ammonium salts of the general formula R1R2R3R4N X wherein<br>
the R groups are independently hydrocarbyl chains of C1-C22<br>
length, typically alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or ethoxylated alkyl groups, and X is a solubilising cation (for example,<br>
compounds in which R1 is a CB-C22 alkyl group, preferably a C8-C10 or C12-C14 alkyl group, R2 is a methyl group, and R3<br>
and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or<br>
hydroxyethyl groups); and cationic esters (for example, choline esters) and pyridinium salts...<br>
The total quantity of detergent surfactant in the composition is suitably from 0.1 to 60 wt% e.g. 0.5-55 wt%, such as 5-50wt%.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant (when present) is in the range of from 1 to 50% by weight of the total composition.  More preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant is in the range of from 3 to 3 5% by weight, e.g. 5 to 30% by weight.<br>
32<br><br>
Preferably, the quantity of nonionic surfactant when present is in the range of from 2 to 25% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 20% by weight.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants may also be used, for example amine oxides or betaines.<br>

The detergent composition may contain as builder a crystalline" aluminosilicate, preferably an alkali metal aluminosilicate, more preferably a sodium aluminosilicate.<br>
The aluminosilicate may generally be incorporated in amounts of from 10 to 70% by weight (anhydrous basis), preferably from 25 to 50%.  Aluminosilicates are materials having the general formula:<br>
0.8-1.5 M20.  A1203.  0.8-6  Si02<br>
where M is a monovalent cation, preferably sodium.  These materials contain some bound water and are required to have a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 50 mg CaO/g.<br>
The preferred sodium aluminosilicates contain 1.5-3.5 SiC&gt;2<br>
units in the formula above.  They can be prepared readily by<br>
33<br><br>
reaction between sodium silicate and sodium aluminate, as amply described in the literature.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally to the aluminosilicate builders, phosphate builders may be used.<br>
Textile Softening and/or Conditioner Compounds:<br>
If the composition of the present invention is in the form of a textile conditioner composition, the textile-compatible carrier will be a textile softening and/or conditioning compound (hereinafter referred to as "textile softening compound"), which may be a cationic or nonionic compound.<br>
The softening and/or conditioning compounds may be water insoluble quaternary ammonium compounds.  The compounds may be present in amounts of up to 8% by weight (based on the total amount of the composition) in which case the compositions are considered dilute, or at levels from 8% to about 50% by weight, in which case the compositions are considered concentrates.<br>
Compositions suitable for delivery during the rinse cycle may also be delivered to the textile in the tumble dryer if used in a suitable form.  Thus, another product form is a composition (for example, a paste) suitable for coating onto, and delivery from, a substrate e.g. a flexible sheet or sponge or a suitable dispenser during a tumble dryer cycle.<br>
34<br><br>
Suitable cationic textile softening compounds are substantially water-insoluble quaternary ammonium materials comprising a single alkyl or alkenyl long chain having an<br>
average chain length greater than or equal to C20- More<br>
preferably, softening compounds comprise a polar head group and two alkyl or alkenyl chains having an average chain<br>

Most preferably at least 50% of the long chain alkyl or<br>
alkenyl groups have a chain length of Ci8 or above.  It is<br>
preferred if the long chain alkyl or alkenyl groups of the textile softening compound are predominantly linear.<br>
Quaternary ammonium compounds having two long-chain aliphatic groups, for example, distearyldimethyl ammonium chloride and di(hardened tallow alkyl) dimethyl ammonium chloride, are widely used in commercially available rinse conditioner compositions.  Other examples of these cationic compounds are to be found in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch. Any of the conventional types of such compounds may be used in the compositions of the present invention.<br>

35<br><br>
25 C, preferably greater than 35 C, most preferably greater<br>
than 45 C.  This LP to La transition can be measured by DSC<br>
as defined in "Handbook of Lipid Bilayers", D Marsh, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 1990 (pages 137 and 337).<br>
Substantially water-insoluble textile softening compounds are defined as textile softening compounds having a<br>
solubility of less than 1 x 10  wt % in demineralised water at 20 C.  Preferably the textile softening compounds have a<br>

Di(tallowoxyloxyethyl).dimethyl ammonium chloride and/or its hardened tallow analogue are especially preferred of the compounds of this type. Other'preferred materials include 1,2-bis(hardened tallowoyloxy)-3-trimethylammonium propane chloride. Their methods of preparation are, for example, described in US 4 137 180 (Lever Brothers Co).  Preferably these materials comprise small amounts of the corresponding monoester as described in US 4 137 180, for example, 1-hardened tallowoyloxy-2-hydroxy-3-trirnethylammonium propane chloride.<br>
Other useful cationic softening agents are alkyl pyridinium salts and substituted imidazoline species.  Also useful are<br>
36<br><br>
primary, secondary and tertiary amines and the condensation products of fatty acids with alkylpolyamines.<br>
The compositions may alternatively or additionally contain water-soluble cationic textile softeners, as described in GB 2 039 556B (Unilever).<br>
The compositions may comprise a cationic textile softening compound and an oil, for example as disclosed in EP-A-0829531.<br>

Lecithins are also suitable softening compounds.<br>
Nonionic softeners include LP phase forming sugar esters (as described in M Hato et al Langmuir 12, 1,659, 1666, (1996)) and related materials such as glycerol monostearate or sorbitan esters.  Often these materials are used in conjunction with cationic materials to assist deposition (see, for example, GB 2 202 244).  Silicones are used in a similar way as a co-softener with a cationic softener in rinse treatments (see, for example, GB 1 549 180).<br>
The compositions may also suitably contain a nonionic stabilising agent.  Suitable nonionic stabilising agents are<br>
linear C8 to C22 alcohols alkoxylated with 10 to 20 moles of alkylene oxide, C10 to C20 alcohols, or mixtures thereof.<br>
777<br><br>
Advantageously the nonionic stabilising agent is a linear Ca<br>

oxide.  Preferably, the level of nonionic stabiliser is within the range from 0.1 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight, most preferably from 1 to 4% by weight.  The mole ratio of the quaternary ammonium compound and/or other cationic softening agent to the nonionic stabilising agent is suitably within the range from 40:1 to about 1:1, preferably within the range from 18:1 to about 3 :1.<br>
The composition can also contain fatty acids, for example C8<br>

stirring under nitrogen for 30 minutes, diisopropyl- (<br>
carbodiimide (29.0cm , 0.18mol) was added dropwise over 20<br>
minutes.  The reaction was allowed to stir overnight under nitrogen.  The mixture was filtered, washed with THF then stirred for one hour to ensure that formation of precipitate<br><br><br>

Acid<br><br>
(1)	Organic solvent method:<br>
Vanillin (9.82 g, 64.5 mMols) was dissolved in anhydrous THF<br>
(100 cm ) with stirring at room temperature and under<br>
nitrogen.  Anhydrous sodium carbonate (8.2 g, 77.4 mMols, 1.2 equiv) was then added and stirring was continued for 30 mins.  Succinyl chloride (5 g, 32.25 mMols, 0.5 equiv) was then added dropwise to the slurry over 20 mins, the mixture was then stirred in the dark for a further 18 hours.  The mixture was then filtered and the solvent removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure to give an off-white solid. The crude product was then recrystallised from IPA to give a<br><br>
white solid (2.7 g, 24 %) .  6H (500 MHz; CDCI3) 3.08 (2H, s,<br><br>
-CH2-C(0) -0-) , 3.89 (3H, s, -OCH3) ,   7.27 - 7.50 (3H, m, Ph) and 9.95 (1H, â¢ s, -CHO) .<br>

Sodium Hydroxide . (1.3 g, 32.5 mmols) was dissolved in<br>
3 distilled water (100 cm ).  To this solution vanillin (4.91<br>
g, 32.5 mmols) was added and the solution was stirred to give a light yellow solution.  The solution was then cooled<br>
to 0  C prior to the dropwise addition of succinyl chloride<br>
(2.5 g, 16.25 mmols).  The mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring was continued for a further 10 mins to give a light yellow precipitate.  The mixture was<br>
then poured into water (200 cm ) and stirred at room<br>
temperature for 30 mins.  The solution was filtered and the solid material retained.  This crude product was then recrystallised to give a white solid (0.84 g, 13 %).<br>

4-Cyanopheriol (7.7 g, 64.5 mMols) was dissolved in anhydrous<br>
3 THF (100 cm ) with stirring at room temperature and under<br>
nitrogen.  Anhydrous sodium carbonate (8.2 g, 77.4 mMols, 1.2 equivalents) was then added and stirring was continued for a further 10 mins.  Succinyl chloride was then added dropwise over 20 mins and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen for a further 18 hours in the dark.  The grey slurry was filtered and the solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure to give a grey solid.  This crude material was then recrystallised from IPA to give a<br>
off-white solid (3.7 g, 36 %).  8H (500 MHz; CDCI3) 3.03 (2H,<br>

Application Examples:<br>
In the examples 14-19 and 27 given below, the synthesised esters were pad applied to oxford cotton fabric (18x6cm) at 100% pick-up from solvent (e.g. THF and/or water). The fabric swatches were then dried, followed by an iron cure on high setting (cotton/linen) for the time specified."<br>
After curing, the swatches were conditioned at 20 C, 65%<br>
relative humidity then the crease recovery angle (CRA) measured (using BS1553086). A sample of fabric (25mmx50mm) was folded in half forming a sharp crease and held under a weight of 1kg for 1 minute.  On releasing the sample the crease opens up to a certain degree.  After 1 minute relaxation, time the angle is measured.  The fabric is tested in the warp direction only (hence maximum CRA is<br>
180 ) .  Higher CRA therefore indicates less wrinkled fabric.<br>
In examples 19-26 blocked isocyanates were pad applied to cotton fabric (18x6cm) at 100% pick-up from an appropriate solvent. The fabric swatches were then dried, followed by an iron cure on high setting (cotton/linen) for the time specified.<br>
After curing, the swatches were conditioned at 20 C, 65%<br>
relative humidity then the crease recovery angle (CRA) measured (using a modified method based on BS1553086). A<br>

sample of fabric (25mmx50mm) is folded in half forming a sharp crease and held under a weight of 1kg for 1 minute. On releasing the sample the crease opens up to a certain degree. After 1 minute relaxation time the angle is measured. The fabric is tested in the warp direction only<br>
(hence maximum CRA is 180Â°).  Higher CRAs correspond to less<br>
wrinkled fabrics.<br>
( Example 14: Application of 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol Diester of<br>

From these results it can be seen that less creasing (higher CRA) was obtairfed with the treated samples than with the untreated samples (UT).  It can also be seen that the effect of a longer ironing-time on treated swatches is to further improve the results for the crease test (which occurs after the ironing step).<br><br><br>

In the case of the treated samples, it can be seen that even a very brief period of ironing gives a marked improvement in crease recovery. It- is believed that this is due to the cross-reaction of the material with cellulose. It is also believed that this is an example of one of the isocyanate reactions which gives a true ester rather than a carbamate on reaction with cellulose.<br>
