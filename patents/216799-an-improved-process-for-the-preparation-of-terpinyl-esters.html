				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of terpinyl esters. This invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of a - terpinyl esters from a - terpineol and carboxylic acids of chain length C2-C5 using immobilised lipase from Mucor melhei and porcine pancreas. More particularly the process relates to the preparation of a - terpinyl acetate, -propionate, -butyrate, -isobutyrate, -valerate and -isovalerate esters.<br>
a - Terpinyl propionate is a commercially important flavour ester which possesses sweet - herbaceous, mildly fruity piny, refreshing odour of moderate tenacity. The ester is also being used as a modifier for Lavender and Bergamot and is very stable in alkaline media. It is used in perfumery for Pine variations, Citrus Colognes, Lavender, Sage and other herbaceous fragrances. This ester requires some specialised esterification conditions for its preparation chemically.<br>
A few chemical methods employed in the preparation of a - terpinyl propionate are listed below :<br>

Major drawbacks in the chemical preparation of a - terpinyl esters are that they cannot be prepared by the usual esterification procedures involving refluxing the tertiary alcohol with the acid in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, the reason being that the reaction would lead to a variety of products like a - terpinene, 1,8 cineole, p - cymene, terpin hydrate and isoterpinolene (S. Geyer, W. Zeiger and R. Mayer, Z Chem 6(4) 138 - 46 1966). Hence, the procedures for the preparation of acetates and other esters involve reaction conditions which demand a low water environment and the absence of a strong<br><br>
acid catalyst. Although quite a few chemical procedures for the preparation of a - terpinyl acetate are known, those for the preparation of esters of other low molecular weight acids are scanty. Most of these procedures involve rigorous fractionation and azeotropic distillations with many unit operations and the formation of other ester impurities. The workout procedures are also quite tedious and many of these are not cost - effective.<br>
Till date, no method on the enzymatic production is known for the preparation of any of the terpinyl esters mentioned above. The present invention involves an enzymatic procedure for the preparation of esters, particularly a -terpinyl propionate. The enzymatic synthesis has many advantages over chemical synthesis such as milder reaction conditions, good yield and pure products.<br>
Main objective of the present invention is to develop an enzymatic process for the preparation of a - terpinyl esters where good yields of a - terpinyl esters are obtained by the reaction of lipase preferably obtained from any source such as Mucor meihei and porcine pancreas in a non - polar solvent.<br>
New principles and advantages underlying the invention are :<br>
Esterification is achieved in a low water environment under milder reaction conditions in a non - polar solvent. The reaction, although slow, yielded a clean product without any side reaction. The method involves the use of carboxylic acid of chain length C2-C5 per se. The yields are almost comparable to those<br><br>
obtained by chemical methods. Rigorous fractionations or azeotropic type esterification methods are not required. Unit operations are less with an easy workout procedure. Use of toxic catalysts is also avoided.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an enzymatic process for the preparation of terpinyl esters which comprises reacting terpineol with carboxylic acid of chain length C2-C5 in equimolar ratio in the range 0.02-0.15M, in<br>
presence of a lipase wherein the ratio of enzyme to substrate should be minimum 10 in presence of non-polar solvent so as to keep the enzyme completely immersed in the solvent under vigorous agitating conditions up to 1 0h at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 60°C and recovering the ester by conventional methods such as herein described.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the terpineol employed is ot      a, p, Y - terpineols.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the carboxylic acid<br>
employed is of chain length C2-C5 	acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric,<br>
valeric and isovaleric acid, their anhydride derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the lipase used is stieh as immobilized lipase from Mucor meihei, Candida cylindracea, Pseudomonas fluorescens, wheat germ, porcine pancreas and chicken liver esterase.<br><br>
In further embodiment of the present invention, the agitation is carried out at 100-250 rpm range.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the non-polar solvent<br><br>
employed is sueh-as heptane, hexane, isooctane, dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
cyclohexane and diisopropyl ether or mixtures thereof.<br>
Immobilised Mucor meihei lipase (Lipozyme IM - 20 immobilised on duolite weak anion exchange resin) was obtained from Novo Nordisk, Denmark.<br>
Immobilised porcine pancreatic lipase from Sigma Chemical Company, USA, was used.<br>
Terpineol, carboxylic acid and non-polar solvent were from commercial sources (Analytical grade) and were distilled once before use.<br>
The reactions were monitored as follows :<br>
Aliquots of the reaction mixture (0.5 ml) were withdrawn at regular intervals of time to which 10 mL of 0.01 N NaOH was added.  This was titrated<br><br>
against 0.01 N oxalic acid with phenolphthalein as indicator. The titre value was compared with the volume of oxalic acid consumed by 10mL of NaOH. Initially, (at 0 hour incubation with enzyme), the difference in titre values between the reaction mixture with added NaOH, and blank (NaOH alone) corresponds to the volume of NaOH consumed by propionic acid. An increase in the volume of oxalic acid consumed by the reaction mixture on titration as compared to the<br><br>
initial value indicates that the concentration of propionic acid has depleted implying that the reaction has proceeded to yield the ester.<br>
While the titration with NaOH showed the consumption of propionic acid in the reaction, Gas Chromatographic analysis showed the formation of the products. A Carbowax 20M column (6m) was used with the column maintained at 100°C and the injection and detection port temperatures being maintained at 200°C and 240°C respectively.<br>
GC retention times :   a - Terpineol: 18.6 min.;<br>
a - Terpinyl propionate : 7.9 min.; Propionic acid : 16.6 min.<br>
