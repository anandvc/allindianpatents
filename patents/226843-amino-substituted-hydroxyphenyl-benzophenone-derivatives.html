The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature from 25 to 200°C, preferably at room temperature. Generally a solvent is not necessary for this reaction step. If a solvent is usee however, preferably the solvents as used in the working examples are preferred.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (1) are suitable especially as UV filters, that is to say for the protection of organic materials that are sensitive to ultraviolet light, especially human and animal skin and hair, against the action of UV radiation. Such compounds are accordingly suitable as light-protective agents in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medicine preparations.<br>
A further object of the present invention is therefore a cosmetic preparation comprising at least one of the compounds of formula (1) together with cosmetically acceptable carriers or adjuvants.<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved state (soluble organic filters, solubilised organic filters) or in the micronised state (nanoscalai organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br><br><br>
As milling apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers there may be used, for example, a jet mill, ball mill, vibratory mill or hammer mill, preferably a high¬speed mixing mill. Even more preferable mills are modern ball mills; manufacturers of these types of mill are, for example, Netzsch (LMZ mill), Drais (DCP-Viscoflow or Cosmo), Buhler AG (centrifugal mills) or Bachhofer. The grinding is preferably carried out with a grinding aid.<br>
Examples of kneading apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers are typical sigma-blade batch kneaders but also serial batch kneaders (IKA-Werke) or continuous kneaders (Continua from Werner und Pfleiderer).<br>
Useful low molecular weight grinding aids for all the above micronisation processes are dispersing agents and surfactants and emulsifiers as disclosed below in the sections entitled "Emulsifiers", "Surfactants" and "Fatty alcohols".<br><br>
Useful polymeric grinding aids for water dispersion are cosmetically acceptable water-soluble polymers with Mn &gt; 500 g/mol, for example: acrylates (Salcare types), modified or non-modified polysaccharides, polyglucosides or xanthan gum. Furthermore an alkylated vinyi-pyrrolidone polymer, a vinylpyrrolidcne/vinyi acetate copolymer, an acyl glutamate, an aikyl polyglucoside, Ceteareth-25 or a phospholipid may be used. Oil dispersions may comprise cosmetically acceptable waxy polymers or natural waxes as polymeric grinding aid to adjust the viscosity during and after processing. Examples of other useful polymeric grinding aids are disclosed below in the section entitled "Polymers'1.<br>
Useful solvents are water, brine, (poly-)ethylene glycol, glycerol or cosmetically acceptable oils. Other useful solvents are disclosed below in the sections entitled "Esters of fatty acids'1, "Natural and synthetic triglycerides, including glyceryl esters and derivatives", "Pearlescent waxes", "Hydrocarbon oils" and "Silicones or siloxanes".<br>
The micronised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2 micrometres, preferably from 0.03 to 1.5 micrometres and more especially from 0.05 to 1.0 micrometres.<br><br><br><br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can also be used dry in powder form. For that purpose, the UV absorbers are subjected to known grinding methods, such as vacuum atomisation, countercurrent spray-drying etc.. Such powders haveja particle size of from 0.1 micrometers to 2 micrometers. To avoid the occurrence of agglomeration, the UV absorbers can be coated with a surface-active compound prior to the pulverisation process, for example with an anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactant, e.g. a phospholipid or a known polymer, such as PVP, an acrylate etc..<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can also be used in specific carriers for cosmetics, for example in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) or in inert sol-gel microcapsules wherein the UV absorbers are encapsulated.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can also comprise one or more than one further UV filter.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorber(s) with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of already known cosmetic UV absorbers, for example octyl methoxycinnamate, salicylic acid<br><br>
isooctyl ester etc.. The UV absorber can be used, for example, without further treatment, or in the micronised state, or in the form of a pcwder.<br>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations contain from 0.05 % to 40 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one UV absorber or a mixture of UV absorbers.<br>
Preference is given to the use of mixing ratios of the UV absorber of formula (1) according to the present invention and optional further light-protective agents of from 1:99 to 99:1, especially from 1:95 to 95:1 and preferably from 10:90 to 90:10, based on weight. Of special interest are mixing ratios of from 20:30 to 30:20, especially from 40:60 to 60:40 and preferably approximately 50:50. Such mixtures can be used, inter alia, to improve solubility or increase UV absorption.<br>
The UV absorbers of formula (1) according tc the present invention or combinations of UV filters are useful for protecting skin, hair and/'cr natural or artificial hair colour.<br>
Suitable UV filter substances which can additionally be used with the UV absorbers according to the present invention are any UV-A and UV-B filter substances.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, al¬coholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above-mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharma¬ceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or mi-croemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, espec¬ially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 ;o 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, frcm 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of :ne composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9<br><br>
% by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adju¬vants.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions/preparations according to the invention may also comprise one or one more additional compounds as described below, for example fatty alcohols, esters of fatty acids, natural or synthetic trigiycerides, including glyceryl esters and derivatives Pearlescent waxes, Hydrocarbon oils, silicones or siloxanes (organo-substituted polysiloxanes), fluorinated or perfluorinated oils,emulsifiers, adjuvants and additives, uperfatting agents, surfactants, consistency regulators/thickeners and rheology modifiers, polymers, anti-dandruff agents, film formers, antioxidants, hydrotropic agents, preservatives and bacteria-inhibiting agents, perfume oils, colorants, or polymeric beads or hollow spheres as SPF enhancers<br>
