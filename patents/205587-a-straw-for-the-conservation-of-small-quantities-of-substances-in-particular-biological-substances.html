COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10] RULE 13<br>
"A   STRAW   FOR   THE   CONSERVATION   OF   SMALL   QUANTITIES   OF SUBSTANCES, IN PARTICULAR BIOLOGICAL   g^K"  SUBSTANCES "<br><br><br>
IMV TECHNOLOGIES, a French company of 10, rue Georges Clemenceau, 61300 L'Aigle, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
2 6 APR 2002<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
25-4-2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to a straw for the conservation of small quantities of substances, in particular biological substances.<br><br>
This type of ' straw, which is known as . a "French straw", was disclosed for the first time in French patent No. 995 878.<br>
Straws manufactured in accordance with the above patent and used until now have  a three-part stopper consisting of two plugs of a fibrous substance with a powder between them that on contact with a liquid is converted into an impermeable gel or paste adhering to the wall of the tube to create a sealed stopper.<br>
Straws with a three-part stopper developed and marketed by the applicant are entirely satisfactory. Nevertheless, some absorption of the liquid contained in the straw has been noted, although it is very slight, of the order of 7%.<br>
One solution to the above problem that has been proposed is* to replace the three-part stopper with a metal or rigid plastics material ball. This solution has not proved satisfactory because, although absorption of the liquid contained in the straw has been eliminated, new and unacceptable difficulties have arisen, the stopper no  longer providing a liquid seal.<br>
The patent FR-A-2 753 367 proposes a straw including a three-part stopper comprising a hydrogel powder between two plugs, namely an external plug and an internal plug,, said straw being characterized in that the length of the external plug is at least twice the length of the internal plug. According to the above patent, absorption of the liquid contained in the straw is only very slightly reduced compared to that observed in a<br><br>
straw fitted with a standard three-part stopper.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a straw fitted with a stoppe   that absorbs only a small quantity of a liquid contained in the straw. To be more precise, an object of the invention is to provide a straw fitted with a stopper that absorbs a quantity of a liquid contained therein at most equal to approximately 4%.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent on reading the following description.<br>
In accordance with the above object, the present invention provides a straw for the conservation of small quantities of substances, in particular biological substances, comprising a segment of tube provided inside one end with a stopper including gel powder, characterized in that a proportion of the gel powder is replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material, said stopper thus comprising a mixture of gel powder and dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
The gel powder is converted on contact with a liquid into an impermeable gel or paste adhering to the wall of the tube to create a sealed stopper.<br>
The gel powder can be alginate or polyvinyl alcohol, for example.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a proportion of the gel powder is replaced with the dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
The nonabsorbent material can be glass, PVC, diatoms, perlites, etc., for example.<br>
The nonabsorbent material must be dispersed.<br>
The particle size of the nonabsorbent material must be close to that of the gel powder.<br>
The particle size of the gel powder used is easy for the person skilled in the art to determine from the nature of said gel powder.<br>
The nonabsorbent material takes the form of balls,<br><br>
for example.<br>
The balls have an average diameter from approximately 50 µm to approximately 300 µm,   for example.<br>
The nonabsorbent material can equally take the form of small flakes or fragments.<br>
In accordance with the invention, from approximately 10% to approximately 50% of the gel powder is replaced with the dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the straw can be fitted with a three-part or one-piece stopper.<br>
The three-part stopper comprises an external part that is not in direct contact with the liquid contained in the straw and an internal part that is in contact with the liquid contained in the straw, with an intermediate part containing the gel powder between them.<br>
The three parts may be substantially the same length or different lengths.<br>
In a first embodiment, the straw is fitted with a standard three-part stopper. The stopper comprises two fibrous substance plugs with a gel powder between them. In accordance with the invention, a proportion of the gel powder of the stopper is replaced with the dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In this first embodiment, the external part is made of a standard fibrous substance and the internal part is made of a standard fibrous substance.<br>
The external and internal parts can take the form of a braid.<br>
The intermediate part comprises a mixture of gel powder and dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In the first embodiment, the straw for the conservation of small quantities of substances, in particular biological substances, comprises a segment of tube provided inside one end with a stopper comprising an external part and an internal part with an intermediate<br><br>
part including the gel powder between them. It is characterized in that the intermediate part comprises a mixture of gel powder and dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the stopper of the straw according to the invention is a three-part stopper and comprises a thermoplastics material core sheathed with filaments constituting a sheath.<br>
In a first instance of this second embodiment, the three-part stopper comprises an external part comprising a fibrous substance braid, an internal part comprising a thermoplastics material core sheathed with filaments constituting a sheath, and an intermediate part comprising gel powder a proportion of which, in accordance with the invention, is replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In other words, in the first and second embodiments, the intermediate part comprises a mixture of gel powder and dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In a second instance of the second embodiment, the three-part stopper comprises an external part comprising a fibrous substance braid, an internal part comprising a thermoplastics material core sheathed with filaments constituting a sheath, said core incorporating a bore, and an intermediate part comprising gel powder a proportion of which, in accordance with the invention, is replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
Once again, the intermediate part comprises a mixture of gel powder and dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In a third instance of the second embodiment, the three-part stopper comprises an external part comprising a fibrous substance braid, an internal part comprising a thermoplastics  material  core  sheathed  with  filaments<br><br>
constituting a sheath, said core including a central braid, and an intermediate part comprising gel powder a proportion of which, in accordance with the invention, is replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
The intermediate part therefore comprises a mixture of gel powder and dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In a third embodiment of the invention, the stopper is a one-piece stopper.<br>
In a first instance of the third embodiment, the one-piece stopper comprises a thermoplastics material core sheathed with filaments constituting a sheath impregnated with a gel powder a proportion of which, in accordance with the invention, is replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In a second instance of the third embodiment, the one-piece stopper comprises a thermoplastics material core sheathed with filaments constituting a sheath and comprising a central braid impregnated with gel powder a proportion of which, in accordance with the invention, is replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
In the case of a three-part stopper, the total<br>
length of the stopper is from approximately 7 mm to<br>
approximately 14 mm.	<br>
The length of the external part is from approximately 3 mmto approximately 14 mm.<br>
The length of the internal part is from approximately 2 mm to approximately 5 mm.<br>
The length of the intermediate part is from approximately 1.5 mm to approximately 5 mm.<br>
The quantity of gel powder that must be incorporated into the stopper of the straw before the implementation of the invention depends on the type of stopper and is known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In all cases, in accordance with the invention, a proportion of  the gel powder must be  replaced with<br><br>
dispersed nonabsorbent material.<br>
The proportion of gel powder replaced .with dispersed nonabsorbent material is from approximately 10% ' to-approximately 50% and depends on the type of .stopper. .The person skilled in the art will in each case easily be able to determine the proportion of gel powder to be replaced with dispersed nonabsorbent material to obtain a straw with a sealed stopper and reduced absorption of<br>
liquid.<br>
    The  straw of   the  invention provides  a  good  seal  and very   little   absorption   of   the   liquid   contained   therein, of the order of  4%  and even less.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a straw for the<br>
conservation  of  small   quantities   of  substances,   in   particular  biological<br>
substances, comprising a segment of tube provided inside one end with a<br>
stopper including gel powder chosen from the group comprising alginates<br>
