				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for producing annular heat-treated circular sliding and rolling machine parts like wheels of railway wagons  and locomotives.<br>
The invention relates  also to an improved system for annular heat-treatment of circular sliding and rolling machine parts like wheels  of railway wagons  as disclosed in Indian Patent Application No.912/Del/96 from which the present application has been divided  out.<br>
The  invention relates  more particularly to a process for high-pressure spray-quenching of the rim of forged wheels of railway wagons  and locomotives to achieve uniform hardness in the rim and a gradual reduction in hardness from the rim to the core of the wheel.<br>
The existing process for heat-treatment of the rim of wheels of railway wagons comprises the following steps  :-(a) heating the wheel to a specified temperature for a specified period;   (b)  placing the wheel to be heat-treated on a stationary platform;  and   (c)  applying quenching water around the rim of the wheel by means  of a stationary water spraying ring, while wheel is allowed to rotate.<br>
The drawbacks of the existing process for heat-treatment of the rim of wheels of railway wagons are that the hardness produced in the wheel rim is low and not uniform and that the decrease in hardness from the rim to the core of the heat-treated wheel is not gradual, because of both the above-mentioned drawbacks the performance of the wheels is affected adversely.<br><br>
Distinguishing features of the invention with reference to prior art are:-<br>
1.	The present invention provides an improved process using a<br>
fully automatic means for controlling the various steps followed in sequence<br>
according to a preset programme. In prior art no such automation of steps, is<br>
provided.<br>
2.	The present invention provides flexibility to control flow rate,<br>
flow pattern, distance between nozzles and work piece and allows to heat-<br>
treat different types (having different diameter and mass) of railway wheels<br>
or other annular items. No such flexibility is provided in prior art.<br>
3.	Desired hardness at surface and inside as required is obtained<br>
by optimizing process parameters in the present invention. In proior art, such<br>
optimization is not provided.<br>
4.	The present invention provides a more reliable and accurate<br>
system than the prior art.<br>
5.	In the prior art process, the hardness of the rim and the<br>
hardness-gradient from the rim to the core of circular parts like wheels of<br>
railway wagons are not optimized by controlling  automatically the speed of<br>
rotation of the circular parts and the duration of quenching to preset levels.<br>
In the invented process, the hardness of the rim and the hardness-gradient from the rim to the core of circular parts like wheels of railway wagons are optimized by controlling automatically the speed of rotation of the circular parts at 10 to 15 r.p.m., the duration of quenching at 220 to 260 seconds, and the pressure of the water spray at 2.5 to 3.5 Kg/cm2<br>
6.	In the process of prior art, the water used for quenching is<br>
allowed to be wasted.<br>
In the invented process, the water used for quenching is recycled to prevent wastage of water.<br><br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for heat treatment of circular sliding and rolling machine parts, which is capable of producing high hardness as well as uniform hardness gradient from the rim to the core of the parts.<br>
Another objective is to provide an improved process using a fully automatic means for controlling the various steps followed in sequence according to a preset programme.<br>
Yet another objective is to provide an improved process which is suitable for hear-treating circular objects of different dimensions.<br>
A further objective is to provide a process using a means for recycling the water used for heat treatment of the parts.<br>
The improved process is carried out using a system which comprises the following accessories: -<br>
(i)	a stationary circular tube for supplying quenching<br>
water, called water-spray ring, having a number of spray nozzles distributed at equal intervals along its internal periphery, all being directed towards its centre;<br>
(ii) a circular turntable for holding the parts to be heat-treated, mounted rotatably and co-axially with respect to the said stationary water-spray ring;<br>
(iii) a driving mechanism for rotating the turntable at a preset speed;<br>
(iv) a cover/lid for enclosing the water-spray ring and the parts placed on the turntable during the heat-treatment thereof by spraying quenching water from the ring, the cover/lid being movable in the axial direction of the water-spray ring and turntable by means of a pneumatic cylinder;<br><br>
(v)      a pneumatic cylinder for causing the movement of the cover in the axial  direction of the water-spray ring and of the turn table;<br>
(vi) a plant for supplying water from an overhead tank at a high pressure to the water-spray ring and pumping the used water back to overhead tank;<br>
(vii)      a plant for supplying compressed air to the pneumatic cylinders for causing movement of the cover/lid to/from the turn table,  to pneumatically controlled valves and to actuator operated valves used in the system;<br>
(viii)    two infra-red pyrometers for measuring the  temperature of heated parts placed on the turn table;  and<br>
(ix)    a control  cubicle containing means for displaying the various operating conditions of the system viz.   temperature of the parts to be heat-treated, pressure and flow rate of water supplied to the water-spray ring as well as a computer for automatically controlling and synchronising the operation of different functional units of the system according to a preset programme.<br>
Thus  the invention provides an improved process for producing annular heat-treated circular sliding and rolling machine parts like wheels of railway wagons and locomotives, using the system as described herein,   characterised in that the process comprises the following steps in sequence :<br>
(a)      heating part in a rotating hearth furnace  to an elevated temperature of 800 - 850°C,  soaking the part completely at the said elevated temperature, placing the part by means of a<br><br>
mobile charger on turn table,  moving downward cover/lid onto the  turn table to enclose water-spray ring and the heated part placed on the turn table by means of pneumatic cylinder and starting rotation of the turn table automatically as soon as the  cover/lid comes to be  in contact with the turn table;<br>
(b)	starting the supply of high pressure water from<br>
overhand tank at a pressure of 2.5 - 3.5 kg/cm2    to ring through<br>
two inlets by means of actuator valves automatically as soon as the  speed of rotation of the turn table increases to 10 - 15 r.p.m.;<br>
(c)	stopping the supply of high-pressure water to the ring<br>
automatically on expiry of a quenching duration of 220 - 260<br>
seconds by actuating a valve provided for the purpose;<br>
(d)	flushing out the water left in the water-spray ring<br>
with compressed air from plant by automatically switching on<br>
pressure control valves,   raising the cover/lid upward from the<br>
level of the  turn table surface automatically by means of<br>
pneumatic cylinders,   removing the heat-treated part from the<br>
turn table surface by means of a mobile charger at a temperature<br>
of 500 - 600°C;  and<br>
(e)	allowing the heat-treated part to self-temper in<br>
natural air by conduction of heat from its core  region to its<br>
surface  region for a duration of 120 to 180 minutes.<br>
An embodiment of the system used for the  invented process is described with reference  to the accompanying drawings in which -<br><br>
Figure 1 is a sketch of the system comprising sources of high pressure water and compressed air supplies, heat-treatment unit, pressure control valves, pneumatic cylinders, actuator operated valves,  control cubicle;<br>

The plant for supplying compressed air   (PAS) supplies compressed  air to  pressure control valves   (PCV),  pneumatic cylinders   (PNC1)  and  actuator operated valves   (AOV1,  AOV2,  AOV3, AOV4).    The used water is collected in sump   (SP)  and fed back into tank   (H).<br><br>
Referring to Fig.  2,  the circular water-spray ring   (R) is of internal diameter 1525 mm and made of a tube of internal diameter 38mm.    The ring is  provided with 16 nozzles   (N) at equal intervals  along its inner periphery and directed towards its centre.    Each nozzle is  of length 152 mm/254 mm, having one nipple and two fixing sockets   (S),   each of internal diameter 18 mm.    Two inlets   (I) are provided for supplying high pressure water into the ring,  each inlet being of internal diameter 38 mm,<br>
Referring to Fig.  3,  the table   (T)  is  rotated by means of a driving mechanism comprising motor  (M),  gearbox  (G) and flexible steel  coupling   (E).    The part  (P)  to be heat-treated is  placed  on the turn table  (T) with the rim of the part  (P) being encircled by water-spray ring   (R) which is  supplied with high pressure water through two inlets   (I) through actuator operated valves   (AOV1,   AOV2).

(b)	soaking the part completely at the said elevated<br>
temperature;<br>
(c)	placing the part by means of mobile charger<br>
on turn table  (T);<br>

(j)        removing the heat-treated part at a given temperature from the turn table surface by means of mobile charger;<br><br>
(k)    allowing the heat-treated part to  self-temper in natural air for a given duration by conduction of heat from its core region to its surface region; characterised in that<br>
(a)	the elevated temperature of the part to be heat-<br>
treated is 800-850°C;<br>

On an average 8 machine parts such as locomotive wheels can be heat-treated per hour in the invented process.<br><br>
Table I Conditions  of Heat-treatment followed for locomotive wheels<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table II Properties of Heat-treated locomotive wheels<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The invented process has a number of advantageous features over the existing process,  such as,<br>
(i)    variable rate of quenching during the heat treatment; (ii)    rotation of the part during heat treatment, leading<br>
to uniform hardness along the rim of the part; (iii)    quenching of the part under optimised flow rate and pressure of the quenching water,  and optimised orientation and dimensions of the nozzles for spraying the quenching water leading to gradual reduction of hardness from the rim toihe core of the heat-treated machine parts; (iv)    suitability for heat-treating machine parts of<br>
versalite dimensions;<br>
(v)    minimised consumption of the quenching water; (vi)    adjustable conditions for heat-treatment;  and (vii)    fully automised operations.<br><br><br>
