fflGHLY-BRE ATHABLE BIODEGRADABLE FUM BAG<br>
DESCRIPTION <br>
The present invention refers to a bag made of a biodegradable uniform film characterised by a high level of breathability which makes it particularly suitable for the purposes of industrial composting.<br>
Composting indicates the industrial process that imitates the processes, reproducing them in a controlled and accelerated form, which in nature return the organic substances to the life cycle. In nature the organic substance produced and no longer "useful" for life (dry leaves, branches, animal remains etc.) is decomposed by the micro organisms present in the soil which return it to the natural cycle. The less degradable components remaining constitute the humus which therefore represents an important food supply for plants given its capacity to release the nutritive elements (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium etc.) slowly but constantly, ensuring constant fertility of the ground. Industrial composting is therefore a process in which structures are provided for rational management of the microbiological activities that occur spontaneously in nature with the aim of reducing the time necessary to obtain a type of humus, i.e. the compost, and improve the quality of the end product with respect to the product obtained naturally. Industrial composting has been the subject of many studies and many composting plants have adopted very sophisticated processes and equipment. One of the main economic obstacles, however, to the spread of industrial composting of organic waste lies in the high cost of the composting which depends on the weight of the organic material to be transformed. The bag made of the highly-breathable biodegradable uniform film according to the present invention facilitates the development of a differentiated collection of organic waste since, due to the uniformity and high breath ability of the bag, the organic part to be disposed of undergoes a considerable weight loss while it is still in the bag.<br>
This is all the more important in consideration of the fact that differentiated collection of organic waste is becoming increasingly necessary also as a result of the European regulation which will make it obligatory by the end of 2006 not to dump waste with an organic content of above 5%.<br>
If, in the light of the above regulation, it is borne in mind that the total quantity of urban waste in Italy alone is estimated to be in the order of approximately 24 Ml tons and the content of put rescible material in the order of 11.4 Ml tons, the importance of stabilising the waste and enhancing it via rapid composting or bio-stabilisation is evident.<br><br>
Even in the current scenario in which this type of waste is dumped, the advantages of the biodegradable bag according to the invention are remarkable. The putrescible waste consists of water for over 60% of its content and the loss of even only 10% in weight results, at the level of the country as a whole, in a loss of hundreds of thousands of tons of water. Apart from the direct economic saving, this means among other things thousands of tons less water in the rubbish dump, more stabilised waste reducing the problems of smell, and saving on thousands of lorry trips to and from the dump. The sale of a bag with -these characteristics by supermarkets, in the form of shoppers, would also permit a significant reduction in waste disposal costs for the municipalities and, at the same time, would make the management of the differentiated collection of putrescible waste much simpler. The biodegradable bag of the invention can also be in the form of a shopper designed for re-use, at the end of its useful life, as a bag for the collection of food scraps. This would also reduce the likelihood of the shopper being left lying around in the environment. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a bag made by a breathable biodegradable unifonn film., the film having a thickness of from 10 to 40 fim and a permeability to water greater than 950 g 30/Ltm/m2 24h measured according to ASTM E96-90. i In the present description uniform film means a film with substantial absence of defects both at microscopic and macroscopic level.<br>
The breathable biodegradable uniform film is made by biodegradable materials. Preferred materials are biodegradable polyesters and biodegradable starch based blends. Alipfciatic-aromatic polyesters of the diacids-diols type are particularly preferred among polyesters. Blend of starch and aliphatic-aromatic polyesters are particularly preferred among starch based blends.<br>
With reference to the diacids-diols type biodegradable polyesters, examples of dicarboixylic acid include oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, undecanedioic, dodecanedioic and brassylic acids.<br>
Examples of polyfunctional aromatic compounds include phthalic acids, in particular terephthalic acid, bisphenol A, hydroquinone, and the like.<br>
Examples of diols include 1,2-ethandiol, 1,2-propandiol, 1,3-propandiol, 1,4-butandioL, 1,6-hexandiol, 1,7-heptandiol, 1,8-octandiol, 1,9-nonandiol, 1,10-decandiol, 1,11-undecantdiol, 1,12-dodecandiol, 1,4-cyclohexandimethanol, neopentylglycol, 2-methyl-l,3-propanLdiol,<br><br>
dianhydrosorbitol, diarihydromannitol, dianhydroiditol, cyelohexandiol, cyclo-<br>
hexanmethandiol.<br>
In addition to the dicarboxylic acid and the diol, the biodegradable polyester may<br>
advantageously comprise as starting monomer also an unsaturated comonomer of either<br>
natural or synthetic origin. The amount of unsaturated comonomer is within the range of<br>
0,5 to 45% of the sum dicarboxylic acid/diol.<br>
Examples of unsaturated acids of synthetic origin include malonic acid, fumiaric acid, vinyl<br>
acetate, acrylic and methacrylic acids, hydroxyalkylaaxylates and<br>
hydroxyalkylmethacrylates.<br>
Examples of unsaturated comonomers of natural origin are itaconic acid, irLonounsaturated<br>
hydroxyacids, such as ricinoleic acid and lesquerolic acid, and mono-, or polyunsaturated<br>
monocarboxylic acids, such as oleic, erucic, linoleic, linolenic acids.<br>
The aliphatic-aromatic polyester may also include, in addition to the base monomers, at<br>
least a hydroxy acid in an amount in the range from 0 to 30% moles based on the moles of<br>
the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. Examples of suitable hydroxy acids include glycolic acid,<br>
hydroxybutyric acid, hydroxycaproic acid, hydroxyvaleric acid, 7-hydroxylieptanoic acid,<br>
8-hydroxycaproic acid, 9-hydroxynonanoic acid and lactic acid.<br>
With reference to the starch based blends, with the term starch it is mea~nt any kind of<br>
natural starch such as com, potato, wheat, tapioca, pea starch and so on. The term starch<br>
comprises also chemically or physically modified starch and it possible to mention, for<br>
instance, starch esters with a substitution degree within the range of 0.2 to 2.5,<br>
hydroxypropylated starches, and starches modified with fatty chains. Starch may also be<br>
used either in the destructurized or the gelatinized form.<br>
In a particularly preferred starch based blend film, the starch is present as a co-continuous<br>
phase or as dispersed phase in the polymeric matrix. In the latter case the starch is<br>
dispersed in particles having dimensions less than 1 /mi preferably less than 0,6 /mi.<br>
At present differentiated waste collection is in many cases carried out using biodegradable<br>
bags which, especially if produced with starch-based film, are able to lose water due to the<br>
hydrophilic nature of the material.<br>
The bags according to the present invention derived from biodegradable uniform film with<br>
thickness between 10 and 40 /xm and with permeability greater than 950 g 30/im/m2 24h,<br>
preferably higher than 1000 g 30/rai/m2 24h, and even more preferably &gt;1L 00 g 30/mi/m2<br>
24h, can reduce, in particular if not placed inside a closed container, the organic waste by<br><br>
over 15% by weight of the waste itself, and preferably over 20%, in less than 7 days, preferably in less than 4 days.<br>
It has been found that when the film has a breathability above 4000 g 30/uin/m2 24h it is no more suitable to be used for the production of bags according to the invention. Preferably the breathability lies below 3000 g 30/im/m2 24h and even more preferably below 2500 g 30/im/m2.<br>
To test the properties of the bag, it can be filled with sawdust to which water completely absorbed by the sawdust itself has been added (normally approximately 20% sawdust and 80% water) and then rested on a grille with sufficiently wide mesh to permit aeration also under the bottom of the bag. The bag can be placed in an environment conditioned at 23 °C with 55% RH and the weight loss can be measured by weighing.<br>
Bags with a high surface area with respect to volume are particularly suitable for the purpose. Bags with volume between 5 and 40 1, preferably between 10 and 30 1, are therefore particularly suitable for the purpose. The property of being breathable can in some cases be useful also in large bags for non-differentiated waste collection as it permits the loss of a certain amount of water with consequent increase in the caloric power of the waste.<br>
The present invention comprises not only biodegradable bags made of material sufficiently hydrophilic to reach permeability values on film of &gt;950 g 30pn/m2 Z4h or, but also bags made of less breathable films that reach the breathability level of 950 g 30/im/m 24h or more by a micro perforation process via laser or via stretching with inorganic or organic fillers, such process being able to form micro holes. With the term microholes it is meant holes that make the film permeable to water vapour but substantially impermeable to liquid water at atmospheric pressure. Bags made of starch based films are particularly preferred since they are characterized by a good biodegradation cap acity even at room temperature (so called "home compostability").<br>
The starch-based films according to the invention must contain thermoplastic starch in a quantity of between 20% and 90%, more preferably between 25% and 60% of the total composition. Thermoplastic polymers insoluble in water (absorption of water below 5% and preferably below 2%) with melting points between 60°C and 150° C provided with good compatibility with starch are another essential component. The same polymers can be the basic raw material for bags obtained by micro perforation.<br><br>
The mechanical properties must be sufficient for the application. This means: tensile<br>
properties, measured on 25-30 jum films at 23° C and 55% RH, with ultimate tensile<br>
strength greater than 16 MPa, modulus &gt; 50 MPa, ultimate elongation &gt;30O% and<br>
preferably ultimate tensile strength greater than 22 MPa, modulus &gt; 100 MPa, ultimate<br>
elongation &gt;350%.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A composition containing<br>
-	36.4 % starch Globe 03401 Cerestar<br>
-	50% Ecoflex® (BASF) 13.6 % glycerine<br>
0.2 parts of Erucamide was placed in a twin-screw extruder OMC, D = 50 mm, L/D= 36 operating with temperature profile 60/140/175/180x4/155x2 at 300 rpm and with degassing to bring the final water content to below 1%.<br>
The granules thus obtained were fed to a Ghioldi filming machine, D = 40 mm, L/D= 30 operating with temperature profile 120/135/145x7 at 64 rpm. A film with breathability of 1460 g 30/im/m2 24h according to ASTM E 96-90 was obtained. Bags of various volumes were produced with said film.<br>
Three bags, sampled at random from a uniform batch, were then used for the following test. A mixture of sawdust and water in a mass ratio of 1 to 4 was prepared in a suitable container. The bags were then filled with the damp sawdust prepared. Table 1 shows the filling load according to the bag volume, indicating two typical commercial bag sizes. With bags of different volume, the quantity of sawdust-water mixture to be used must be varied proportionally.<br>
For example if the bag has a volume equal to 15 litres, the weight of the sawdust-water mixture must be equal to:<br><br><br>
After filling, the bags were closed at approximately 5 cm from the opening using the tie provided with the bag or a piece of string. The bags were then rested on a grille having cells with sides between 1.5 cm and 5 cm made of metal or plastic wire. The grille was then suspended at 5 cm at least from the ground. The test was carried out in an environment conditioned at 23°C (±2) with 55% RH (±2). The bags were then weighed at the beginning of the test and after 7 days.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 (Comparison)<br>
Experiment 1 was repeated with the following composition:<br>
-	28.0 % starch Globe 03401 Cerestar<br>
-	65.7% Ecoflex® (BASF) 6.0 % glycerine<br>
0.3 % parts of Erucamide A film with breathability of 850 g 30/rai/m2 24h according to ASTM E 96-90 was obtained. Bags of 20 fim thickness and 10 1 volume were produced with said film. The test of example 1 was repeated and the weight loss mean value detected after 7 days was of 157,3 g, corresponding to a weight loss % of about 10.48 %.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The present invention refers to a bag made by a breathable biodegradable unifonn film., the film having a thickness of from 10 to 40 fim and a permeability to water greater than 950 g 30/Ltm/m2 24h measured according to ASTM E96-90. i In the present description uniform film means a film with substantial absence of defects both at microscopic and macroscopic level.<br>
The breathable biodegradable uniform film is made by biodegradable materials. Preferred materials are biodegradable polyesters and biodegradable starch based blends. Alipfciatic-aromatic polyesters of the diacids-diols type are particularly preferred among polyesters. Blend of starch and aliphatic-aromatic polyesters are particularly preferred among starch based blends.<br>
With reference to the diacids-diols type biodegradable polyesters, examples of dicarboixylic acid include oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, undecanedioic, dodecanedioic and brassylic acids.<br>
Examples of polyfunctional aromatic compounds include phthalic acids, in particular terephthalic acid, bisphenol A, hydroquinone, and the like.<br>
Examples of diols include 1,2-ethandiol, 1,2-propandiol, 1,3-propandiol, 1,4-butandioL, 1,6-hexandiol, 1,7-heptandiol, 1,8-octandiol, 1,9-nonandiol, 1,10-decandiol, 1,11-undecantdiol, 1,12-dodecandiol, 1,4-cyclohexandimethanol, neopentylglycol, 2-methyl-l,3-propanLdiol,<br><br>
dianhydrosorbitol, diarihydromannitol, dianhydroiditol, cyelohexandiol, cyclo-<br>
hexanmethandiol.<br>
In addition to the dicarboxylic acid and the diol, the biodegradable polyester may<br>
advantageously comprise as starting monomer also an unsaturated comonomer of either<br>
natural or synthetic origin. The amount of unsaturated comonomer is within the range of<br>
0,5 to 45% of the sum dicarboxylic acid/diol.<br>
Examples of unsaturated acids of synthetic origin include malonic acid, fumiaric acid, vinyl<br>
acetate, acrylic and methacrylic acids, hydroxyalkylaaxylates and<br>
hydroxyalkylmethacrylates.<br>
Examples of unsaturated comonomers of natural origin are itaconic acid, irLonounsaturated<br>
hydroxyacids, such as ricinoleic acid and lesquerolic acid, and mono-, or polyunsaturated<br>
monocarboxylic acids, such as oleic, erucic, linoleic, linolenic acids.<br>
The aliphatic-aromatic polyester may also include, in addition to the base monomers, at<br>
least a hydroxy acid in an amount in the range from 0 to 30% moles based on the moles of<br>
the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. Examples of suitable hydroxy acids include glycolic acid,<br>
hydroxybutyric acid, hydroxycaproic acid, hydroxyvaleric acid, 7-hydroxylieptanoic acid,<br>
8-hydroxycaproic acid, 9-hydroxynonanoic acid and lactic acid.<br>
With reference to the starch based blends, with the term starch it is mea~nt any kind of<br>

At present differentiated waste collection is in many cases carried out using biodegradable<br>
bags which, especially if produced with starch-based film, are able to lose water due to the<br>
hydrophilic nature of the material.<br>
The bags according to the present invention derived from biodegradable uniform film with<br>
thickness between 10 and 40 /xm and with permeability greater than 950 g 30/im/m2 24h,<br>
preferably higher than 1000 g 30/rai/m2 24h, and even more preferably &gt;1L 00 g 30/mi/m2<br>
24h, can reduce, in particular if not placed inside a closed container, the organic waste by<br><br>
over 15% by weight of the waste itself, and preferably over 20%, in less than 7 days, preferably in less than 4 days.<br>
It has been found that when the film has a breathability above 4000 g 30/uin/m2 24h it is no more suitable to be used for the production of bags according to the invention. Preferably the breathability lies below 3000 g 30/im/m2 24h and even more preferably below 2500 g 30/im/m2.<br>
To test the properties of the bag, it can be filled with sawdust to which water completely absorbed by the sawdust itself has been added (normally approximately 20% sawdust and 80% water) and then rested on a grille with sufficiently wide mesh to permit aeration also under the bottom of the bag. The bag can be placed in an environment conditioned at 23 °C with 55% RH and the weight loss can be measured by weighing.<br>
Bags with a high surface area with respect to volume are particularly suitable for the purpose. Bags with volume between 5 and 40 1, preferably between 10 and 30 1, are therefore particularly suitable for the purpose. The property of being breathable can in some cases be useful also in large bags for non-differentiated waste collection as it permits the loss of a certain amount of water with consequent increase in the caloric power of the waste.<br>
The present invention comprises not only biodegradable bags made of material sufficiently hydrophilic to reach permeability values on film of &gt;950 g 30pn/m2 Z4h or, but also bags made of less breathable films that reach the breathability level of 950 g 30/im/m 24h or more by a micro perforation process via laser or via stretching with inorganic or organic fillers, such process being able to form micro holes. With the term microholes it is meant holes that make the film permeable to water vapour but substantially impermeable to liquid water at atmospheric pressure. Bags made of starch based films are particularly preferred since they are characterized by a good biodegradation cap acity even at room temperature (so called "home compostability").<br>
The starch-based films according to the invention must contain thermoplastic starch in a quantity of between 20% and 90%, more preferably between 25% and 60% of the total composition. Thermoplastic polymers insoluble in water (absorption of water below 5% and preferably below 2%) with melting points between 60°C and 150° C provided with good compatibility with starch are another essential component. The same polymers can be the basic raw material for bags obtained by micro perforation.<br><br>
The mechanical properties must be sufficient for the application. This means: tensile<br>
properties, measured on 25-30 jum films at 23° C and 55% RH, with ultimate tensile<br>
strength greater than 16 MPa, modulus &gt; 50 MPa, ultimate elongation &gt;30O% and<br>
preferably ultimate tensile strength greater than 22 MPa, modulus &gt; 100 MPa, ultimate<br>
elongation &gt;350%.<br>

The granules thus obtained were fed to a Ghioldi filming machine, D = 40 mm, L/D= 30 operating with temperature profile 120/135/145x7 at 64 rpm. A film with breathability of 1460 g 30/im/m2 24h according to ASTM E 96-90 was obtained. Bags of various volumes were produced with said film.<br>
Three bags, sampled at random from a uniform batch, were then used for the following test. A mixture of sawdust and water in a mass ratio of 1 to 4 was prepared in a suitable container. The bags were then filled with the damp sawdust prepared. Table 1 shows the filling load according to the bag volume, indicating two typical commercial bag sizes. With bags of different volume, the quantity of sawdust-water mixture to be used must be varied proportionally.<br>
For example if the bag has a volume equal to 15 litres, the weight of the sawdust-water mixture must be equal to:<br><br><br>
After filling, the bags were closed at approximately 5 cm from the opening using the tie provided with the bag or a piece of string. The bags were then rested on a grille having cells with sides between 1.5 cm and 5 cm made of metal or plastic wire. The grille was then suspended at 5 cm at least from the ground. The test was carried out in an environment conditioned at 23°C (±2) with 55% RH (±2). The bags were then weighed at the beginning of the test and after 7 days.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 (Comparison)<br>
Experiment 1 was repeated with the following composition:<br>
-	28.0 % starch Globe 03401 Cerestar<br>
-	65.7% Ecoflex® (BASF) 6.0 % glycerine<br>
0.3 % parts of Erucamide A film with breathability of 850 g 30/rai/m2 24h according to ASTM E 96-90 was obtained. Bags of 20 fim thickness and 10 1 volume were produced with said film. The test of example 1 was repeated and the weight loss mean value detected after 7 days was of 157,3 g, corresponding to a weight loss % of about 10.48 %.<br></td>
