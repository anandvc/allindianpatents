				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for colouring synthetic textile material selected<br>
from aromatic polyester, secondary cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, polyamide and<br>
polyacrylonitrile or fibre blend thereof.<br>
]P A-54-050681 discloses, in general terms, the use of fluorosulphonyl group-containing<br>
reactive disperse dyes for dyeing cellulose-containing textiles but discloses specifically<br>
only certain azo and anthraquinone dyes for this purpose.<br>
US-A-5503956 discloses a black laser dye-ablative recording element comprising a support,<br>
which may be a polyester, having thereon a dye layer comprising a mixture of at least one<br>
cy.in, magenta and yellow dye dispersed in a polymeric binder and having an infra red<br>
absorbing material associated therewith. There is no reference therein to dyes containing a<br>
fluorosulphonyl group.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for colouring synthetic textile<br>
material selected from aromatic polyester, secondary cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate,<br>
polyamide and polyacrylonitrile or fibre blend thereof, which comprises applying to the<br>
synthetic textile material a dye, which is free from water solubilising groups, carrying at<br>
least one -SO2F group provided that the dye is not an azo, bisazo, or anthraquinone dye.<br>
The presence of one or more -SO2F groups in a dye molecule generally improves    the<br>
properties  of that dye  and confers  surprisingly good wet-fastness  and light-fastness<br>
properties.<br>
The synthetic textile material may be selected from secondary cellulose acetate, cellulose<br>
triacetate,   polyamide,  polyacrylonitrile   and  aromatic   polyester.   The   synthetic   textile<br>
material  is  preferably  polyamide  or  aromatic  polyester,   such   as   polyhexamethylene<br>
adipamide or polyethylene terephthalate more preferably aromatic polyester and especially<br>
poiyethlene terephthalate. Fibre blends may comprise mixtures of different synthetic textile<br>
materials or mixtures of synthetic and natural textile materials. Preferred fibre blends are<br>
these of polyester cellulose such as polyester-cotton. The textile materials or blends thereof<br>
ma y be in the form of filaments, loose fibres, yarn, woven or knitted fibres.<br>
The present dyes preferably have low solubility in water, typically less than 1% preferably<br>
les.s than 0.5% and especially less than 0.2% solubility in water.    They are thus free from<br>
wa ler solubilising groups such as -SO3H, -CO2H, -PO3H and quaternary amino.<br><br>
The dyes of the present invention as herein described optionally in admixture with each other and optionally in conjunction with other disperse dyes such as azo, bisazo or anthraquinone dyes may be applied to the synthetic textile materials or fibre blends thereof by methods which are conventionally employed in dyeing disperse dyes to such materials and fibre blends.  For example, the dyes of the present invention, in the form of an aqueous dispersion, may be applied by dyeing, padding or printing processes using the conditions and<br>
additives conventionally used in carrying out such processes. The process conditions may be selected from the following:<br>
i) exhaust dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 125°C to 140°C for from 10 to 120 minutes and under a pressure of from 1 to 2 bar, in which a sequesterant may optionally be added; li) continuous dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of<br>
from 190°C to 225°C for from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, in which a migration inhibitor may optionally be added; iii) printing direct at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 160°C to 185°C for 4 to 15 minutes for high temperature steaming, or at a temperature of from 190°C to 225°C for 15 seconds to 5 minutes for bake fixation with dry heat or at a temperature of from 120°C to 140°C and 1 to 2 bar for 10 to 45 minutes for pressure steaming, in which wetting agents and thickeners (such as alginates) of from 5 to 100% by weight of the dye may be optionally be added; tv) discharge printing (by padding the dye onto the textile material, drying and overprinting) at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, in which migration inhibitors and thickeners may optionally be added; v) carrier dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 95°C to 100°C using a carrier such as methylnaphthalene, diphenylamine or 2-phenylphenol, in which sequesterants may optionally be added; and ri) atmospheric dyeing of ace;tate, triacetate and nylon at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of 85°C for acetate or at a temperature of 90°C for triacetate and nylon for from 15 to 90 minutes, in which sequesterants may optionally be added.<br>
In all the above processes the	dye is<br>
applied as a dispersion comprising from 0.001% to 4% of the dye in acfueous medium.<br>

The dyes of the present invention preferably carry a total of from one to three -SC^F groups, more preferably from one to two -SOL,F groups and especially one -SCt,F group.<br>
The dyes of Formulae (2) to (16) and (23) to (25) used in the above coloration process are novel and form a further feature of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of Formulae (2) to (16) and (23) to (25) may be mixed with structurally similar compounds or the compounds of Formulae (2) to (16) and (23) to (25) may be mixed with dyes which do not contain an -SCLF group.  The mixtures may be simple physical mixtures or may be mixed crystals formed for example-by co-crystallisation.  Such mixtures generally show improvement in dyeing properties.  Crystalline modifications of compounds of Formulae (2) to (16) and (23) to (25) exist and it is intended that the present definition includes such crystalline modifications which may be formed by heat treatment.<br>
Compositions conprising dispersions of the dyes of the present invention in aqueous media are novel and form a further feature of the present invention. The compositions typically comprise from 1% to 30% of dye and are preferably buffered at a pH from 2 to 7, more preferably at a pH from 4 to 6.<br>
These dispersions may further comprise ingredients conventionally used in dyeing applications such as dispersing agents, for example, lignosulphonates, naphthalene sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensates or phenol/cresol/sulphanilic acid/formaldehyde condensates, surfactants, wetting agents such as alkyl aryl ethoxylates which may be sulphonated or phosphated, inorganic salts, de-fearners such as mineral oil or nonanol, organic liquids and buffers. Dispersing agents may be present at from 10% to 200% on the weight of the  dye.<br>
Wetting agents may be used at from 0% to 20% on the weight of the<br>
dye .	The dispersions may be prepared by bead<br>
milling the compound of Formula (1) with glass beads or sand in an aqueous medium.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a process for the mass coloration of plastics which comprises incorporating into a plastics material a dye except for azo.<br>
bisazo and anthracquinone dyes or mixture of dyes which is free from water solubilising groups and which carry at least one -S02F group.<br>
The plastics may be selected from polystyrene, acrylics, styrene/acrylonitrile mixtures, acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene mixtures, polycarbonate, polyether-sulphone, nylons, rigid PVC (uPVC) and polypropylene.<br>
The dye or dye mixture may be incorporated by blending with granules or powdered plastics material, by for example, dry tumbling or high-speed mixing followed by injection moulding on a screw machine or by conventional compounding/xrasterbatching techniques.  The present dyes generally dissolve or disperse readily in hot plastics melt and provide bright coloration with good clarity and good light fastness.<br>
The plastics material when coloured with the above dyes form a further feature of the present invention.<br>
Fluorosulphonyl groups may be introduced into precursors of the dyes of Formulae (2) to (16) free from fluorosulphonyl groups by methods generally available in the literature. For example reaction of such a precursor of a dye of Formulae (2) to (16) with chlorosulphonic acid optionally in the presence of dimethylformamide and thionylchloride at a temperature of from 30°C to 140°C gives the chlorosuLphonyl derivative. The chlorosulphonyl derivative may be reacted in boiling aqueous media with potassium fluoride to give the fluorosulphonyl derivative.<br>
Altentatively the precursor of the dye of Formulae (2) to (16) may be sulphonated with sulphuric acid or oleum to give the sulphonic acid derivative which may be converted to the chlorosulphonyl derivative by reaction, either of the free acid or an inorganic salt thereof, with thionylchloride optionally in the presence of a chlorophosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachloride in an organic liquid such as an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of from 20°C to 110°C.  Similarly a sulphonate ester may be converted to the corresponding chlorosulphonyl derivative.  The chlorosulphonyl derivative may then be converted to the fluorosulphonyl derivative as described above.<br>
Precursors of the dyes of Formulae (2) to (16) before chlorosulphonation or sulphonation may be prepared by methods available in the literature.<br>
