THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"METHOD OF COMBATING OR CONTROLLING PESTS AND COMPOSITIONS OF A CARBAMATE WITH A PYRAZOLE, PYRROLE OR PHENYLIMIDAZOLE"<br>
BASF   AGRO   B.V.,   Arnhem   (NL),   Wadenswil-Branch,   CH-Wadenswil/AU, Switzerland<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
T&amp;erpresent  invention relates to insecticidal compositions comprising an insecticidal compound from the class of the carbamates and an insecticidal compound containing a pyrazole, pyrrole or phenylimidazole group, and to insecticidal crop treatment methods using the said insecticidal compositions.<br>
A great variety of insecticidal compounds are known in the literature. However, the known insecticidal compounds, although possessing certain insecticidal effects, often do not permit numerous problems encountered by the users of such products to be remedied.<br>
One of the problems encountered in the protection of crops against harmful insects lies in the need to reduce the amounts of active ingredient used whilst allowing a satisfactory efficacy to be obtained. Indeed, it is common to broadcast or employ large amounts of the said insecticidal active ingredients.<br>
Another problem encountered concerns the need to have active ingredients which are effective against a broad spectrum of harmful insects capable of ravaging or damaging crops.<br>
Another problem relates to the effect over time of the active ingredients employed for the<br><br>
protection of crops: it is desirable both to have active ingredients possessing an immediate, or virtually immediate/ insecticidal activity following application to the crops, and also that these said active ingredients possess an insecticidal effect whose duration is sufficient to allow effective and lasting protection of the crops against harmful insects.<br>
Another problem lies in the fact that certain insecticidal active ingredients do not possess an immediate insecticidal effect but act only after a certain period of time has elapsed following application, thereby allowing the populations of harmful insects to multiply before the active ingredient utilized takes effect.<br>
Another problem encountered with a considerable number of insecticidal active ingredients is that their efficacy is only curative, therefore obliging the user to undertake demanding and careful nonitoring of the crops in order to determine the exact time of treatment.<br>
Another problem of significance is that a lumber of insecticidal active ingredients have only a preventive effect, therefore forcing the user to broadcast amounts of these active ingredients which, subsequently, prove to be useless.<br>
Another problem associated with the use of certain insecticidal active ingredients resides in the phenomenon of resurgence of the populations of harmful insects treated, a phenomenon which is critical to the <br><br>
user, who initially sees the populations of harmful organisms reduced after treatment but then, subsequently, sees these populations grow again. Although this phenomenon of resurgence is not frequent, it is extremely damaging when it does occur.<br>
The numerous problems which have been set out above are very often accompanied by those associated with the protection of the environment, environmental problems to which the users of insecticidal active ingredients are more and more sensitive, as are the consumers of the products obtained from these crops.<br>
Another difficulty in relation to the use of many insecticides lies in the cumulative effect of two or more of the problems which have been set out above. Indeed, it is even more difficult to solve the problems which have arisen when they accumulate, since the solutions which may be considered are in some cases contradictory or even conflictive.<br>
Mereover, and of a general nature, it is always desirable to improve the spectrum of activity and the efficacy of compounds having an insecticidal action, or to reinforce the said spectra of activity and of efficacy, by combining the said compounds in order to obtain a higher-performance product or combination.<br>
It is also desirable to prevent the appearance of resistances to these insecticides on the part of harmful insects.<br><br><br>
It is likewise always desirable to provide the user of these insecticidal compounds with an increased range of insecticidal means for combating or controlling harmful insects, particularly in the field of agriculture, owing in particular to the devastation which these harmful insects can reek to crops.<br>
It is likewise highly desirable to improve or better control the rate or persistency of action of these insecticidal compounds.<br>
It is likewise always desirable to provide the user of these insecticidal compounds with means of combating or controlling harmful insects under specific conditions of use, especially in accordance with the environment of the crops to be protected or in accordance with the crops or the harmful insects ravaging or damaging these crops.<br>
It is also most desirable to provide insecticidal control means which possess a so-called knockdown insecticidal effect, the said knockdown effect consisting, in the sense of the present text, in a rapid effect of the insecticidal action.<br>
It is likewise desirable to allow a persistency of action over time of the insecticidal action of the insecticidal active ingredients employed.<br>
The present invention therefore proposes to provide solutions to all or part of the many problems which have been set out above. The present invention also proposes to attain all or part of the objectives which have been referred to.<br><br>
One essential aspect of the present invention relates to insecticidal compositions which can be used, in particular, in the field of agriculture, especially for the protection of plants.<br>

with the proviso that, if R1 represents the methyl radical, then R3 represents a haloalkyl radical, R4 represents -NH2, R11 represents C1, R13 represents -CF3 and X represents N;<br>
the alkyl and alkoxy radicals of the formula (I) are preferably lower alkyl and alkoxy radicals, i.e. radicals possessing from one to four carbon atoms;<br>
the haloalkyl and haloalkoxy radicals likewise possess preferably from one to four carbon atoms;<br>
the haloalkyl and haloalkoxy radicals can carry one or more halogen atoms; the preferred radicals of this type comprise -CF3 and -OCF3.<br>
In one preferred variant, the insecticidal compositions according to the invention comprise an insecticidal compound (A) of formula (I) in which:<br>
R1 represents -CN; and/or<br>
R4 represents -NR5R6; and/or<br>
R5 and R6 are selected independently from the hydrogen atom, an alkyl or haloalkyl radical, -C(O)alkyl and C(0)0R7; and/or <br><br>

As far as the carbamates which the insecticidal compositions according to the invention comprise as insecticidal compound (B) are concerned, it is preferred to use the arylcarbamates or alkylcarbamates which are also referred to, respectively, as aryl carbamates and alkyl carbamates. More preferably, the carbamates employed in the insecticidal compositions according to the <br><br>
invention as insecticidal compound (B) are arylalkylcarbamates.<br>
Still more preferably, the said carbamates employed in the insecticidal compositions according to the invention as insecticidal compound (B) are phenylcarbamates, preferably phenylalkylcarbamates, especially phenylmethylcarbamates or phenylethyl-carbamates.<br>
Furthermore, the phenyl or aryl groups of the phenyl- or arylcarbamates employed in the insecticidal compositions according to the invention are most frequently substituted, in particular by alkyl groups, halogen atoms or groups carrying one or more sulphur or oxygen atoms.<br>
With particular advantage, the insecticidal compositions according to the present invention comprise fenobucarb, chemical name 2-sec-butylphenyl methylcarbamate, as insecticidal compound (B).<br>
Moreover, the carbamates employed in the insecticidal compositions according to the invention are known per se to have certain insecticidal properties or to have an insecticidal activity, while being acceptable for uses in agriculture, especially for the treatment or protection of crops.<br>
Especially advantageously, the insecticidal compositions according to the present invention are characterized in that they comprise fenobucarb, chemical name 2-sec-butylphenyl methylcarbamate, as<br><br>
insecticidal compound (B); the said fenobucarb also being known by the name or abbreviation BPMC.<br>
An especially preferred variant of an insecticidal composition according to the invention is that which comprises fipronil, chemical name 5-amino-3-cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-4-trifluoromethylsulphinylpyrazole, as insecticidal compound (A) and fenobucarb, chemical name 2-sec-butylphenyl methylcarbamate, as insecticidal compound (B) .<br>
Within the different variants of insecticidal compositions according to the present invention, the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) are employed in amounts which are effective but not phytotoxic.<br>
In relation to the insecticidal compounds (A) having a pyrazole, pyrrole or phenylimidazole group which are employed in the different insecticidal compositions according to the present invention, reference may also be made to those described by the European Patent or Patent Applications EP-0 295 117, EP-0 460 940 or EP-0 484 165, respectively, and in the International Patent Application WO 98/28279.<br>
Reference may also be made to the publication referenced as follows, J". Econ.   Entomol. , 1962, 55, 889, regarding some of the insecticidal compounds (B), especially the insecticidal compound (B) called fenobucarb or BPMC.<br>
For the entirety of the present text, the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) employed may be<br><br>
designated without distinction by any one of the following expressions: active ingredients or else compounds or insecticidal compounds or active substances or insecticidal ingredients, without departing from the spirit of the present invention in so doing, in particular owing to the insecticidal properties of these compounds, ingredients or ingredients.<br>
For their use in practice, the various insecticidal compositions according to the invention, as described above, are rarely used alone.<br>
In the insecticidal compositions according to the invention, the insecticidal active ingredients (A) and (B) are normally combined with a solid or liquid carrier which can be used in the field of agriculture and optionally with at least one surfactant.<br>
These insecticidal compositions, which can be used in particular for protecting plants against insects, include as active ingredient at least one of the insecticidal compounds (A) or (B) as described above in combination with the solid or liquid carriers which are acceptable in agriculture and/or the surfactants which are likewise acceptable in agriculture.<br>
However, most frequently, the insecticidal compositions according to the invention simultaneously combine an insecticidal compound (A) and an insecticidal compound (B).<br><br><br>
The carriers which can be used are, in particular, the usual, inert carriers; similarly, the surfactants which can be used are the surfactants which are usual in the fields of the formulation of compounds intended for uses in agriculture, especially for the treatment or protection of crops.<br>
The insecticidal compositions according to the invention commonly comprise between 0.00001 and 100%, preferably between 0.001 and 80%, of insecticidal compounds (A) and (B), irrespective of whether these compounds are combined or whether they are in the form of two separate active ingredients.<br>
The proportions and percentages employed or described, both within the entirety of the present description and in the claims which follow, are proportions or percentages by weight.<br>
When they employ two active ingredients together, the said insecticidal compositions according to the invention can comprise the said active ingredients in quantities such as described above but also in ratios A/B of between 0.001 and 50, preferably of between 0.006 and 5.<br>
The term carrier as used in the present description denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic ingredient with which the active ingredient or ingredients (A) and/or (B) are combined in order to facilitate their application to the plant, or else to the seeds or the soil.<br><br><br>
This carrier is therefore generally inert and must be acceptable in agriculture, especially by the treated plant.<br>
The carrier can be solid, in particular clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers, etc.; or liquid, such as water, alcohols, ketones, petroleum fractions, aromatic or paraffinic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, liquefied gases, etc.<br>
The surfactant can be an emulsifier, dispersant or wetting agent of the ionic or nonionic type.<br>
Mention may be made, for example, of the salts of polyacrylic acids, the salts of lignosulphonic acids, the salts of phenolsulphonic or naphthalene-sulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols, especially alkylphenols or arylphenols, salts of sulphosuccinic esters, derivatives of taurine, especially alkyltaurates, phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polyethoxylated phenols.<br>
The presence of at least one surfactant is generally indispensable when at least one of the active ingredients and/or the inert carrier are insoluble, especially in water, in the case where the application vehicle is water.<br>
The insecticidal compositions according to the invention can also include any kind of other<br><br>
ingredients or agents such as, for example, protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrants, stabilizers, sequestrants, etc., and other active ingredients known for their pesticidal properties, especially insecticides or fungicides, or for their plant growth promoting properties, especially fertilizers; or for their plant or insect growth regulating properties.<br>
More generally, the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) can be combined with all of the solid or liquid additives corresponding to the common techniques of formulation, particularly formulation of products or compositions intended for uses or utilities in agriculture or in public hygiene.<br>
For their application, therefore, the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) are often in the form of insecticidal compositions which can take on fairly diverse forms and can, in particular, be in solid or liquid forms.<br>
As solid forms of insecticidal compositions according to the invention, mention may be made of dustable or dispersible powders whose proportion of insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) can range up to 100%; similarly, granules, especially those obtained by extrusion, compaction, by impregnating a granulated carrier, or by granulation from a powder; the proportion of insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) in these granules being most often between 0.5 and 80% for these latter cases.<br><br>
The insecticidal compounds (A) or (B), alone or in combination according to the invention, can also be used in the form of dustable powders.<br>
As forms of liquid insecticidal compositions according to the invention, or those intended to be employed as liquid insecticidal compositions at the time of application, mention may be made of solutions, in particular soluble concentrates, especially those soluble in water; emulsfiable concentrates; emulsions; suspension concentrates; aerosols; wettable powders or flo-dusts; pastes; and possible mixtures, combinations or associations of these various forms.<br>
The insecticidal compositions according to the invention referred to as concentrated compositions, comprising an insecticidal compound (A) and an insecticidal compound (B) which are in the form of emulsifiable concentrates or soluble concentrates, most frequently contain from 25 to 100% of active ingredients, the application-ready emulsions or solutions for their part containing from 0.00001 to 20% of active ingredients.<br>
It goes without saying that the expression active ingredients must be understood throughout the present specification as referring, as appropriate, to a single active ingredient or insecticidal compound (A) or (B) but also to a combination of these two active ingredients.<br>
In addition to the solvent, the emulsifiable concentrates can, when necessary, contain from 2 to 20%<br><br>
of appropriate additives such as the abovementioned stabilizers, surfactants, penetrants, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives.<br>
The insecticidal compositions according to the invention in the form of suspension concentrates, which can also be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to give a stable fluid product which does not settle; they normally contain from 2 to 75% of active ingredient, from 0.5 to 15% of surfactants, from 0.1 to 10% of thixotropic agents, from 0 to 10% of appropriate additives, such as antifoams, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and adhesives; and, as the carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient or ingredients is or are insoluble or of low solubility, or else mixtures of two or more of these solvents, organic or inorganic.<br>
Certain solid organic ingredients or inorganic salts can be dissolved in the carrier in order to prevent or hinder sedimentation, or else such ingredients can be used as antifreeze agents for water.<br>
The insecticidal compositions according to the invention which take the form of wettable powders or flo-dusts are commonly prepared such that they contain from 20 to 95% of active ingredient(s).<br>
Moreover, they normally contain, in addition to a solid carrier, from 0 to 5% of a wetting agent, from 3 to 10% of a dispersant and, if appropriate, from 0 to 10% of one or more stabilizers and/or other <br><br>
additives, such as penetrants, adhesives or anticaking agents, colorants, etc.<br>
In order to obtain these flo-dusts or wettable powders, the active ingredient or ingredients is or are intimately mixed in appropriate mixers with the additional substances, and ground using appropriate mills or other suitable grinders. This results in flo-dusts whose wettability and suspendability are particularly advantageous.<br>
They can be suspended with water at any desired concentration.<br>
As an alternative to wettable powders, insecticidal compositions according to the invention can be produced which are in the form of pastes.<br>
The conditions and modalities of producing and using these pastes are similar to those of the wettable powders or flo-dusts.<br>
As has already been stated, the aqueous emulsions and dispersions, for example the insecticidal compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or an emulsifiable concentrate according to the invention with the aid of water, are included within the general scope of the present invention.<br>
The emulsions can be of the water-in-oil type or oil-in-water type and can have a thick or fairly thick consistency.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the different insecticidal compositions which have been described above may also take the form <br><br>
of a mixture prepared in situ, commonly known as a tank mix.<br>
These insecticidal compositions in tank mix form are commonly in the form of dilute insecticidal compositions.<br>
In this case, the insecticidal compositions according to the invention are present in the form of insecticidal compositions containing separately the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B), the said insecticidal compositions therefore having to be mixed at the time of their application or at the time of the preparation of the dilute insecticidal composition to be applied.<br>
Most often, these insecticidal tank mix compositions are mixed in the reservoir of the application device.<br>
Nevertheless, these insecticidal compositions comprising the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B) separately can also be applied separately, in particular after dilution, thereby making it possible to provide the properties of the insecticidal compositions according to the invention, comprising the said insecticidal compounds (A) and (B), directly at the site of application.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention resides in the methods of treating or of protecting crops, employing insecticidal compositions according to the invention comprising an insecticidal compound (A) and an insecticidal compound (B).<br><br>
Generally speaking, the said insecticidal compositions according to the invention are employed by the intervention of one or more insecticidal compositions according to the invention.<br>
However, this employment of the said insecticidal compositions according to the invention can also be carried out differently without, in so doing, departing either from the spirit or from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the said employment of these insecticidal compositions according to the invention can be carried out in accordance with various modes of application, but also in accordance with different application techniques, or else for the protection of different types, varieties or families of vegetables or plants, or else for the combat or control of different types or species of insects, especially harmful insects.<br>
As far as the different modes of application of the compositions according to the invention comprising an insecticidal compound (A) and an insecticidal compound (B) are concerned, particular possibilities are simultaneous, separate, alternate or sequential application.<br>
Nevertheless, for the employment of the insecticidal compositions according to the invention, the preferred modes of application consist most often in processes of simultaneous application of the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B).<br><br><br>
Such modes of application of the insecticidal compositions according to the invention may also take the form of methods of employing or using the different compositions according to the invention described above; in this case, the modes of application and the methods comprise technical steps which are of the same nature as those described above.<br>
The simultaneous application of the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B), included in the various possible forms of compositions according to the invention, can take place in particular by employing a composition according to the invention which comprises the said insecticidal compounds, or else by the use of such a composition which has, however, been prepared in situ from two, or more, insecticidal compositions according to the invention each comprising one of the insecticidal compounds (A) and (B).<br>
The separate application of the compositions according to the invention can in particular take the form of employing two insecticidal compositions according to the invention each comprising one of the insecticidal compounds, (A) or (B).<br>
According to another variant, the application of the compositions according to the invention can be carried out alternately, specifically by alternate application of two or more insecticidal compositions according to the invention each comprising one of the insecticidal compounds, (A) or (B).<br><br><br>
Another mode of application of the compositions according to the invention relates to the sequential application of two or more insecticidal compositions according to the invention each comprising one of the insecticidal compounds, (A) or (B).
