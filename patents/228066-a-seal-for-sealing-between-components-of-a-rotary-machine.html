				<td>In a casing of a rotary machine, cast components are sealingly mounted together by means of seals accommodated in (semi-) enclosed cavities. A ring seal includes an annular base and an annular skirt extending axially from the base. To ameliorate manufacturing tolerances, the seal defines circumferentially spaced, intermittent cavities to allow seal material to be deformed into the cavities as required. Land areas between cavities have cross-sectional surfaces increasing progressively from a free surface of small area to cause compressive force required for deformation to increase exponentially with an exponent larger than 1. The cavities may be peripherally spaced, being open at a radially outer surface of the seal. The seal may be of elastic material which may be incompressible. The skirt may taper away from the base. The base may have a projecting sealing lip. The skin may have, at a free end, a slanted, peripheral lip.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>THIS invention relates to sealing between components of rotary<br>
machinery, especially sealing between components of pumps.<br>
In a rotary machine, generally, a rotor is rotatable in a casing, on which<br>
one or more other stationary components, such as pipe flanges, wear liners, and the like,<br>
are mounted. Such components are frequently in the form of castings, which, in their "as<br>
cast" state, have wide dimensional tolerances. Thus, the capacities of sealing volumes<br>
between such components can vary between wide limits generally necessitating annealing<br>
the components and then machining faces which will define the sealing volumes.<br>
Sometimes, it is necessary to heat treat components after machining which may cause<br>
further, unacceptable, deformation requiring yet a further or final machining operation.<br>
Machining is often problematic due to asymmetry in the components, bearing in mind<br>
that components of rotary machines are intended to be generally round symmetrical.<br>
Furthermore, components generally require to be concentrically assembled.<br>
Especially when sealing volumes are enclosed, tight tolerances are<br>
required when sealing material which is incompressible, such as rubber, is to be used.<br>
This invention relates in general to a seal for sealing between components<br>
of a rotary machine at an annular sealing interface where opposing surfaces of the<br>
components define an enclosed or partially enclosed seal volume, of generally<br>
predetermined shape, configuration and orientation, between relatively high pressure and<br>
low pressure zones, the seal being in the form of a ring of pliable material and defining a<br>
plurality of cavities arranged to accept deformed material to allow deformation of the<br>
material of the seal into cavities, the seal including a skirt which extends generally<br>
longitudinally, which has radially inner and outer peripheral surfaces, and which is<br><br>
generally wedge shaped, a taper end of the skirt then having a free end which is intended<br>
to be positioned at a high pressure zone of the seal volume.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of this invention, in a seal of the kind<br>
described, said cavities alternate with land areas, the cavities and land areas being<br>
distributed peripherally, cross sectional surfaces through the land areas at respective radii<br>
increasing progressively from a surface of the skirt to cause compressive force, required<br>
to cause deformation of the land areas, to increase exponentially with an exponent larger<br>
than 1.<br>
Preferably, the cavities and the land areas respectively may be oriented<br>
longitudinally, the cavities and land areas being spaced peripherally.<br>
In one kind of embodiment, the cavities may be open along the radially<br>
outer surface of the skirt, cross-sectional surfaces of the land areas at the outer periphery<br>
of the skirt being at a minimum, the respective cross-sectional surfaces of the land areas<br>
increasing with decreasing radius. Thus, advantageously, radially outer surfaces of the<br>
land areas may be convexly rounded.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of this invention, in a seal of the kind<br>
described, said pliable material is elastic and has deformation / stress characteristics<br>
falling within the following range and having the following values:<br>
for elongation of 100%, a tensile stress of between 0,2 and 1,8, preferably about 1<br>
N/mm2;<br>
for an elongation of 200%, a tensile stress of between 0,8 and 4,8, preferably<br>
about 2,7 N/mm2;<br>
for an elongation of 300%, a tensile stress of between 12,2 and 24,7, preferably<br>
about 18,5 N/mm2.<br>
The material may be an appropriate grade of natural or synthetic rubber. It<br>
may, for example, be an appropriate urethane.<br><br>
The material may be substantially incompressible.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of this invention, in a seal of the kind<br>
described, the skirt extends from a base which has radially inner and outer faces and a<br>
back intermediate said inner and outer faces, the inner and outer faces converging in a<br>
direction away from said back.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the base, in cross-section, may be partially<br>
hollow, said cavities being contained at least partially between the inner and outer faces,<br>
the seal including land areas, in amongst which the cavities are dispersed, the land areas<br>
intruding in between the inner and outer faces and up to the back. The inner and outer<br>
faces of the base may be most widely spaced proximate the back, and may be adapted for<br>
use with a seal cavity which is correspondingly shaped, to promote sealing pressure to<br>
maintain sealing in the region of the base, regardless of the status of the sealing pressure<br>
and seal material deformation.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of this invention, in a seal of the kind<br>
described, said seal comprises an annular base from which the skirt extends<br>
longitudinally, the annular base being of larger annular thickness than a thicker end of the<br>
skirt, the base having along one surface thereof a projecting peripheral base lip<br>
configured to contact an annular zone of the seal cavity.<br>
In one kind of embodiment said base lip may be along a radially outer<br>
surface of the seal, and may be oriented radially outwardly and toward a relatively high<br>
pressure end of the seal cavity. The base lip may be in the form of a re-entrant lip along<br>
an outer peripheral surface of the base.<br>
In accordance with a fifth aspect of this invention in a seal of the kind<br>
described, the skirt has, at its free end, a skirt lip slanted to press against a corresponding<br>
annular portion of said high pressure zone.<br><br>
The skirt lip may be slanted radially inwardly to be offered to a radially<br>
inner surface of the seal volume in use.<br>
In accordance with a sixth aspect of this invention, in a seal of the kind<br>
described, one of the inner and outer peripheral surfaces of the skirt includes an oblique<br>
section shaped and oriented to match an opposing surface defining the seal volume, but at<br>
an angle selected to press an end of the skirt toward its free end against said opposing<br>
seal surface of the seal cavity.<br>
Said oblique section may be along the radially inner peripheral surface of<br>
the skirt, said oblique section being a-cylindrical and tapering toward the free end of the<br>
skirt.<br>
Said one of the inner and outer peripheral surfaces of the skirt may have,<br>
in series with said oblique section, a decumbent section oriented to lie decumbently with<br>
a corresponding surface of the seal volume. Said decumbent section may be cylindrical,<br>
may be along the radially inner periphery of the seal surface, and may be toward the low<br>
pressure end of the seal.<br>
In accordance with a seventh aspect of this invention, in a seal of the kind<br>
described, one of the radially inner and outer peripheral surfaces of the seal is configured<br>
to lie against a corresponding surface of the seal cavity, the other having said cavities in<br>
alternating arrangement with land areas, in which an annular portion toward one end of<br>
the skirt is chamfered relative to an opposing seal surface to facilitate assembly of the<br>
seal in the seal volume.<br>
The radially inner surface may be smoothly curved, the radially outer<br>
surface having the open cavities and land areas.<br>
The chamfered portion may be at the free end of the skirt.<br><br>
The invention extends to a combination of a rotary machine having<br>
components defining an annular sealing interface where opposing surfaces of the<br>
components define an enclosed or partially enclosed seal volume, and a seal in<br>
accordance with any aspect of this invention.<br>
The invention is now described by way of example with reference to the<br>
accompanying diagrammatic drawings. In the drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows, fragmentarily, in axial section, a slurry pump in accordance with<br>
the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows, in axial view, a seal in accordance with the invention forming<br>
part of the slurry pump of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows, fragmentarily, in axial section, to an enlarged scale, the seal of<br>
Figure 2; and<br>
Figure 4 shows, fragmentarily, to an enlarged scale, in three-dimensional view,<br>
the seal of Figures 2 and 3.<br>
With reference to Figure 1 of the drawings, a rotary slurry pump in<br>
accordance with this invention is generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The slurry<br>
pump 10 is generally symmetrical (except for a volute and an outlet flange thereof) to a<br>
centre line generally indicated by reference numeral 11. Only one half of the pump, to<br>
one side of the centre line 11, is shown in axial section.<br>
The pump 10 comprises a pump casing generally indicated by reference<br>
numeral 12 and providing an inlet 26 and an impeller cavity and volute generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 14 for accommodating a rotary impeller 16. An outlet in<br>
communication with the volute is not shown in the drawing. The impeller 16 is carried<br>
on a rotary shaft 18 by means of which the impeller is rotated in use within the stationary<br>
casing 12.<br>
Sealing is required along the end of the casing 12 corresponding to the<br>
position of the shaft 18, and which is generally referred to as the dry end or the drive end.<br><br>
The sealing is generally indicated by reference numeral 19.   It is of composite structure<br>
and only one aspect thereof is discussed further.<br>
The pump casing 12 is of composite structure, comprising an outer,<br>
peripheral main casing portion 20 in the form of a peripheral cap. It further comprises a<br>
pair of opposing end liners, more specifically a suction end liner 22 on a suction side of<br>
the pump, and a drive end liner 24 on a drive end or dry end of the pump 10. The liners<br>
22, 24 are mounted partially in conjunction with liner clamps 28, 30. At both ends, the<br>
main casing portion 20 has peripheral seats generally indicated by reference numerals<br>
20.1. Each seat 20.1 diverges axially outwardly in steps, initially having a first, relatively<br>
shallow divergence angle, followed by a substantially steeper divergence angle in series<br>
with the first mentioned divergence angle.<br>
Complementally, the suction end liner 22, and the drive end liner 24 each<br>
has a radially outwardly facing peripheral seat 22.1, 24.1, which is cylindrical.<br>
When assembled, the opposing seat pairs 20.1, 22.1 and 20.1, 24.1 form<br>
therebetween annular seal cavities within which seal rings 40 are provided. The seal<br>
rings 40 are identical, or substantially identical. Thus only one of the seal rings is<br>
described in more detail. The seal ring 40 embodies the subject matter of this invention.<br>
It is illustrated and is now described in more detail with reference to Figures 2 and 3.<br>
When seen in cross-section, the seal 40 includes a peripheral skirt<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 42, extending from a profiled, generally "U"<br>
shaped base 44 lying on its side as seen in cross section. The skirt 42 is in the form of an<br>
elongation of a radially inner one of the limbs of the "U" shaped base 44. The skirt<br>
tapers from a relatively thicker cross-section at the base 44, to a relatively thinner cross-<br>
section at a free end thereof. An initial section of the skirt 42, at the base 44 and<br>
indicated by reference numeral 42.2, is cylindrical corresponding to the orientation of the<br>
seat 22.1, 24.1.   Toward the free end, a further section, indicated by reference numeral<br><br>
42.1, is sloped toward the axis, thus tapering toward the free end to secure an interference<br>
fit over the respective seat 22.1, 24.1.<br>
An opposed, radially outer limb of the "U" shaped base 44, generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 44.1, slopes toward the skirt 42 and has an annular,<br>
radially outwardly tapering lip having an inner extremity 44.2.<br>
The free end of the skirt 42 tapers in a radially inwardly turned annular lip<br>
46.<br>
The seal 40 comprises a plurality of longitudinally oriented,<br>
circumferentially spaced land areas 48. The land areas 48 are roughly in the form of<br>
fingers extending from a back of the base 44 initially intermediate the opposed limbs, to<br>
the end of the skirt 42. Each land area 48 is of part round cross-section, being of convex<br>
shape. They are spaced to provide corresponding cavities intermediate the land areas 48.<br>
Each land area 48, toward its free end, is chamfered as shown at 48.1. The cavities<br>
extend partially into the "U" shaped base 44.<br>
The seal 40 is in the form of a moulding of synthetic elastomeric material<br>
such as rubber, urethane, or the like. The deformation / stress characteristics of the<br>
material are important, as described above in accordance with the second aspect of the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably, the seal 40 has an interference fit over its radially inner seat<br>
22.1, 24.1 such that a deformation of between about 6% and about 4% is provided, i.e.<br>
such that a mean inner diameter of the seal 40 is between about 0,94 and about 0,96 of<br>
the outer diameter of the respective seat 22.1, 24.1.<br>
Furthermore, the included angle of the taper face 42.1 is between about<br>
10° and about 16°, in accordance with the sixth aspect of the invention. It is thus ensured<br>
that the skirt 42, toward its free end 42.1, presses against the respective seat 22.1, 24.1 to<br><br>
promote sealing between the respective end liner 22, 24 and the main casing portion 20<br>
proximate the high pressure or wet end of the seal 40.<br>
Further in this regard, the radially inwardly turned lip 46 at the free end of<br>
the skirt 42, which is in accordance with the fifth aspect, further enhances sealing in that<br>
area.<br>
In accordance with the seventh aspect of the invention, the chamfered<br>
portions 48.1 of the land areas 48 facilitate feeding the seal 40 into the tapering seal<br>
cavity.<br>
In accordance with the third aspect of the invention, the radially inward<br>
and radially outward faces of the limbs of the "U" shaped back 44 converge as they<br>
extend away from the back of the "U". Thus, in use, a complemental seal cavity will be<br>
provided to ensure that, during compression of the seal 40 during assembly, pressure is<br>
maintained in the region of the base 44 to ensure continued sealing in that area regardless<br>
of the status of the compression and deformation of the seal.<br>
As mentioned at the outset, the main advantage of the seal in accordance<br>
with the invention is that it provides resilient sealing against the respective seats and that<br>
material of the seal, deformed during pressure-assembly, can flow into cavities<br>
intermediate the land areas, thus allowing the seal to be used in seal cavities having large<br>
tolerances in respect of size. It is important that each of the land areas 48 is of very little<br>
area near its radially outer extremity, and that the cross-sectional area increases with<br>
decreasing radius, thus being conducive to easy seating intitally and requiring a<br>
progressively larger deformation force as the land are is deformed.<br>
The outwardly turned lip 44.2 at the free end of the outer limb of the base<br>
44 enhances sealing against the seat 20.1.<br><br>
The Applicant believes that this invention has an important advantage in<br>
so far as it provides a seal, which can be of an incompressible material such as rubber,<br>
and which is appropriate for sealing in cavities differing between wide limits in respect of<br>
size or volume. This is made possible by providing land areas and cavities inbetween<br>
land areas to allow deformation of the land areas into the cavities upon compression. The<br>
features of the seal described above enhance sealing and further allow easy assembly and<br>
dismantling.<br><br>

and which is generally wedge shaped, a taper end of the skirt then having a free end<br>
(42.1) which is intended to be positioned at a high pressure zone of the seal volume, in<br>
which the skirt (42) has, at its free end (42.1), a skirt lip (46) slanted to press against a<br>
corresponding annular portion (22.1, 24.1) of said high pressure zone.<br>
16.	A seal as claimed in Claim 15 wherein the skirt lip is slanted radially<br>
inwardly to be offered to a radially inner surface of the seal volume in use.<br>
17.	A seal (40) for sealing between components (20, 22, 24) of a rotary<br>
machine (10) at an annular sealing interface where opposing surfaces of the<br>
components define an enclosed or partially enclosed seal volume, of generally<br>
predetermined shape, configuration and orientation, between relatively high pressure<br>
and low pressure zones, the seal being in the form of a ring (40) of pliable material and<br>
defining a plurality of cavities arranged to accept deformed material to allow<br>
deformation of the material of the seal into cavities, the seal including a skirt (42) which<br>
extends generally longitudinally, which has radially inner and outer peripheral surfaces,<br>
and which is generally wedge shaped, a taper end of the skirt then having a free end<br>
(42.1) which is intended to be positioned at a high pressure zone of the seal volume, in<br>
which one of the inner and outer peripheral surfaces of the skirt (42) includes an oblique<br>
section shaped (42.1) and oriented to match an opposing surface (22.1, 24.1) defining<br>
the seal volume, but at an angle selected to press an end of the skirt toward its free end<br>
against said opposing seal surface of the seal cavity.<br><br>
18.	A seal as claimed in Claim 17 wherein said oblique section is along the<br>
radially inner peripheral surface of the skirt, said oblique section being a-cylindrical and<br>
tapering toward the free end of the skirt.<br>
19.	A seal as claimed in Claim 18 wherein said one of the inner and outer<br>
peripheral surfaces of the skirt has, in series with said oblique section, a decumbent<br>
section oriented to lie decumbently with a corresponding surface of the seal volume.<br>
20.	A seal as claimed in Claim 19 wherein said decumbent section is<br>
cylindrical, is along the radially inner periphery of the seal surface, and is toward the low<br>
pressure end of the seal.<br>
21.	A seal (40) for sealing between components (20; 22, 24) of a rotary<br>
machine (10) at an annular sealing interface where opposing surfaces of the<br>
components define an enclosed or partially enclosed seal volume, of generally<br>
predetermined shape, configuration and orientation, between relatively high pressure<br>
and low pressure zones, the seal being in the form of a ring (40) of pliable material and<br>
defining a plurality of cavities arranged to accept deformed material to allow<br>
deformation of the material of the seal into cavities, the seal including a skirt (42) which<br>
extends generally longitudinally, which has radially inner and outer peripheral surfaces,<br>
and which is generally wedge shaped, a taper end of the skirt then having a free end<br>
(42.1) which is intended to be positioned at a high pressure zone of the seal volume, in<br>
which one of the radially inner and outer peripheral surfaces (42.1, 42.2) of the seal<br>
(40) is configured to lie against a corresponding surface (22.1, 24.1) of the seal cavity,<br>
the other having said cavities in alternating arrangement with land areas (48), in which<br>
an annular portion (48.1) toward one end of the skirt is chamfered relative to an<br>
opposing seal surface (20.1) to facilitate assembly of the seal in the seal volume.<br>
22.	A seal as claimed in Claim 21 wherein the radially inner surface is<br>
smoothly curved, the radialy outer surface having the open cavities and land areas.<br>
23.	A seal as claimed in Claim 21 or Claim 22, wherein the chamfered portion<br>
is at the free end of the skirt.<br><br>
24.	A combination of a rotary machine (10) having components (20, 22, 24)<br>
defining an annular sealing interface (20.1, 22.1, 24.1) where opposing surfaces of the<br>
component define an enclosed or partially enclosed seal volume, and a seal (40) as<br>
claimed in any one of the preceding claims accommodated within the seal volume.<br>
25.	The combination as claimed in Claim 24, in which the rotary machine is a<br>
centrifugal pump.<br>
26.	The combination as claimed in Claim 25 in which the centrifugal pump is<br>
a slurry pump.<br><br>
1.	A seal (40) for sealing between components (20; 22, 24) of a rotary<br>
machine (10) at an annular sealing interface where opposing surfaces of the<br>
components define an enclosed or partially enclosed seal volume, of generally<br>
predetermined shape, configuration and orientation, between relatively high pressure<br>
and low pressure zones, the seal being in the form of a ring (40) of pliable material and<br>
defining a plurality of cavities arranged to accept deformed material to allow<br>
deformation of the material of the seal into cavities, the seal including a skirt (42) which<br>
extends generally longitudinally, which has radially inner and outer peripheral surfaces,<br>
and which is generally wedge shaped, a taper end of the skirt then having a free end<br>
(42.1) which is intended to be positioned at a high pressure zone of the seal volume, in<br>
which said cavities alternate with land areas (48), the cavities and land areas being<br>
distributed peripherally, cross sectional surfaces through the land areas at respective<br>
radii increasing progressively from a surface of the skirt to cause compressive force,<br>
required to cause deformation of the land areas, to increase exponentially with an<br>
exponent larger than 1.</td>
