DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG 2, a motorcycle windshield assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention includes two frame units 8 coupled bilaterally to a windshield 9. Each frame unit 8 includes a pair of corresponding adjusting elements 1, a pair of corresponding left and right covers 2, a sliding element 3, a resilient element 4, an installation rod 5, an adapter plate 6, a threaded fastener 7, a washer 71, and a screw nut 72.<br>
Each adjusting element 1 is formed of a tough plastic and has an inner side concavely provided with a groove 11. Each adjusting element 1 further has a lateral side peripherally formed with teeth 12. One of each pair of the adjusting elements 1 is protrudingly provided with hooks 13 that are arranged on two sides of the groove 11. The other of each pair of the adjusting elements 1 is formed with recesses 14 corresponding in position to the hooks 13 of the corresponding adjusting element 1 so that the two corresponding adjusting elements 1 can be coupled together via engagement between the hooks 13 and the recesses 14.<br>
Each pair of the left and right covers 2 are formed of a tough plastic and have an end concavely provided with receiving spaces 21 for receiving the corresponding pair of adjusting elements 1. The receiving spaces 21 of each pair of the left and right covers 2 have predetemiined sections formed with teeth 22 corresponding in position to, and configured for meshing with, the teeth 12 of the corresponding pair of adjusting elements 1, wherein the teeth 22 must outnumber the corresponding teeth 12. Each cover 2 has a side concavely provided with a guide groove 23. Each cover 2 further has a lower end provided with a space 24.<br>
Each sliding element 3 is made of a touch plastic and has an inner side provided with an engaging portion 31 peripherally formed with a plurality of convex surfaces 32. Each sliding<br><br><br>
element 3 further has an outer side extended with a projecting portion 33 for engaging with a corresponding positioning portion 91 of the windshield 9. The engaging portion 31 of each sliding element 3 has a surface penetrated by a plurality of holes 34.<br>
Each installation rod 5 is a rod configured for installing the windshield 9. Each installation rod 5 has an upper section and a lower section, wherein the upper section has a relatively small outer diameter and serves as an enclosed section 51, and the lower section is formed as a threaded section 52.<br>
Each adapter plate 6 is composed of a locking nut 61 and an extension portion 62, wherein the locking nut 61 is internally provided with a threaded hole, and the extension portion 62 has an end penetrated by a hole 621 capable of being inserted by and coupled with rear-view mirrors of different specifications.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 and FIG. 10, each frame unit 8 is assembled in the following manner from two corresponding adjusting elements 1, corresponding left and right covers 2, one sliding element 3, one resilient element 4, one installation rod 5, and one adapter plate 6. To begin with, the enclosed portion 51 of the installation rod 5 is fitted into the grooves 11 formed on the inner sides of the two corresponding adjusting elements 1. Then, the hooks 13 on one of the two adjusting elements 1 are engaged with the recesses 14 of the other adjusting element 1 such that the two adjusting elements I are coupled together.<br>
Next, the projecting portion 33 on the outer side of the sliding element 3 is brought into contact with the corresponding positioning portion 91 of the windshield 9 so as for a plurality of threaded fasteners 35 to pass through the holes 34 of the sliding element 3 and then enter threaded holes 92  of the corresponding positioning portion 91   of the windshield  9,<br><br><br>
respectively, thereby fastening the shding element 3 to the windshield 9, After that, the engaging portion 31 of the sliding element 3, which is now coupled with the windshield 9, is fitted into the corresponding guide grooves 23 of the corresponding left and right covers 2 such that the convex surfaces 32 peripherally formed on the engaging portion 31 of the sliding element 3 press against the guide grooves 23 of the two corresponding covers 2.<br>
At the same time, the two corresponding adjusting elements 1 coupled with the installation rod 5 are fitted into the receiving spaces 21 of the left and right covers 2, thus allowing the teeth 12 of the two adjusting elements 1 to mesh with the teeth 22 formed on the predetermined sections of the receiving spaces 21 of the left and right covers 2. Afterward, the resilient element 4 is put into the spaces 24 at the lower ends of the left and right covers 2 such that the resilient element 4 is compressed. Then, the threaded fastener 7 is passed through the left and right covers 2 and connected with the washer 71 and the screw nut 72, thereby completing the assembly of one frame unit 8, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The resilient elements 4 function as follows. When it is desired to adjust the frame units 8, the screw nuts 72 must be properly loosened. At that time, each resilient element 4 supports the corresponding left and right covers 2 to thereby prevent the corresponding pair of adjusting elements 1, as well as the corresponding sliding element 3 coupled with the windshield 9, from falling off the left and right covers 2.<br>
After the frame units 8 are coupled to the windshield 9, the lower end of each installation rod 5 is threadingly coupled to the corresponding adapter plate 6 by the locking nut 61 thereof, as shown in FIGS. 2, 3, and 4. The hole 621 of the extension portion 62 of each adapter plate 6 is subsequently inserted by and coupled with a rear-view mirror 10 of a motorcycle, as shown in FIG. 5, wherein the rear-view mirror 10 can be of different specifications.<br><br><br>
Thus, the windshield 9 is installed between the left and right rear-view mirrors 10 of the motorcycle and is operable in the following manner. The windshield 9 can be raised to a height needed at the moment to ward off wind, flying sand, or insects, as shown in FIG 6 and FIG. 7. To adjust the height of the windshield 9, a user only has to grasp an upper end of the windshield 9 by hand and pull the windshield 9 upward, i.e., in a direction indicated by the vertical arrow of FIG 6. By dosing so, the sliding elements 3 coupled with the windshield 9 are moved upward along the guide grooves 23 of the two pairs of left and right covers 2. As soon as the windshield 9 reaches the desired height, and the upward pull is stopped, the convex surfaces 32 peripherally formed on each sliding element 3 once again press against the guide grooves 23 of the corresponding pair of covers 2.<br>
The windshield 9 installed between the left and right rear-view mirrors 10 of the motorcycle can also be lowered according to the need of shielding, as shown in FIG 8 and FIG 9. More specifically, the user can press at the upper end of the windshield 9 by hand and push the windshield 9 downward, i.e., in a direction indicated by the vertical arrow of FIG 8, such that the sliding elements 3 coupled to the windshield 9 are moved downward along the guide grooves 23 of the two pairs of left and right covers 2. As soon as the windshield 9 reaches the desired position, and the downward push is stopped, the convex surfaces 32 peripherally formed on each sliding element 3 continue to press against the guide grooves 23 of the corresponding pair of covers 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10 and FIG. 11, the windshield 9 installed between the left and right rear-view mirrors 10 of the motorcycle can also be tilted to a desired angle by pressing at an outer portion of the windshield 9 and pushing the windshield 9 downward in the desired tilt direction, i.e., in a direction indicated by the solid-head arrow of FIG 11. Thus, the teeth 22 of each pair of the left and right covers 2 coupled to the windshield 9 are moved along the<br><br><br>
teeth 12 formed on the corresponding pair of adjusting elements 1, which are coupled to the corresponding installation rod 5. When the windshield 9 is tilted to the desired angle, and the downward push is stopped, the teeth 22 of each pair of the left and right covers 2 are once again locked with the teeth 12 of the corresponding pair of adjusting elements 1. The aforesaid operation is equally applicable to collapsing the windshield 9 when it is not in use.<br><br><br>
