l-»4)]-a-L-ARABINOPYRAN0SIDE OR AN EXTRACT FROM PULSATILLAE RADIX CONTAINING THE SAME AS A THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR SOLID TUMORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a use of hederagenin 3-O- α -L-rhamnopyranosyl((l—&gt;2)-<br>
[|3-D-glucopyranosyl(l—»4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside as represented by the following<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
or an extract from Pulsatillae radix containing the same as a therapeutic agent for<br>
solid tumors.<br>
BACKGROUNDART<br>
Pulsatillae radix is a dried root of Pulsatilla species belonging to the<br>
Ranunculaceae family (Ki Hwan Bae, Korean Medicinal Herbs, 1999). According to the<br>
Chinese medicine, Pulsatillae radix is known to have effects of removing heat from the<br>
blood and detoxifying. It has also been used as anti-inflammatory, astringent, hemostatic<br>
and antidiarrhea agents, and for the treatment of hematochezia, malaria, nosebleed, and<br>
bleeding from tooth. Its flower is called as Pulsatillae Flos, and used for the treatment of<br>
malaria, or smallpox. Its leaf is called as Pulsatillae Folium, and used for treatment of<br>
waist pain, edema, or heart pain. In addition, decoction of Pulsatillae radix was reported<br>
to have an antibacterial effect against amoebic dysentery, and a pesticidal effect against<br>
Trichomonas.<br>
Pulsatillae radix contains about 9% of saponins, and such ingredients as<br>
protoanemonin, anemonin, ranunculin, hederagenin, betulinic acid, and oleanolic acid<br>
derivatives and their glycosides have been isolated therefrom by now as represented by the<br>
following formula (II):<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
The above ingredients have not yet been extensively studied for their<br>
pharmacological effects, but protoanemonin was reported to have mitotoxicity<br>
(Vonderbank, F., Pharmazie 5, 210, 1950). Li, et al. (Li, R. Z., et al., Yao Hsueh Hsueh<br>
Pao. 28, 326 31, 1993) also reported that ranunculin has cytotoxicity against KB cells, by<br>
inhibition of DNA polymerase.<br>
Hederagenin 3-O--L-rhamnopyranosyl(l—2)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(l—»4)]-ct-Larabinopyranoside<br>
was isolated from Pulsatilla cerna and P. kqreana by Shimizu, et al.<br>
(Chem. Pharm. Bull., 26, 1666, 1978); from P. chinensis by Yoshihrro, etal. (J. Nat. Pro.,<br>
62, 1279, 1999); and from Serjania salzmanniana Schleeht by Ekabo, et al. (J. Nat. Prod.,<br>
59, 431, 1996). Kang, et al. (Arch. Pharm. Res., 12(1), 42-47, 1989) also isolated it from<br>
P. koreana, and reconfirmed its structure. Yoshihiro, et al. reported that hederagenin and<br>
oleanolic acid derivatives showed cytotoxicity against HL-60 human leukemia cells in the<br>
above article. They reported that hederagenin 3-O- α -L-rhamnopyranosyl(l—»2)-[p-Dglucopyranosy](<br>
l -&gt;4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside isolated from Chinese Pulsatillae radix<br>
(Pulsatilla clunensis) had week cytotoxicity, i.e. 3.8 ug/ml of ED50, against HL-60 cells.<br>
However, most of saponins and many kinds of natural products commonly show such level<br>
of cytotoxicity, and thus, the above compound cannot be said to have antitumor activity<br>
based thereon. Therefore, it has never been known that hederagenin 3-O-ct-LrhamnopyranosyK<br>
1 —»2)-[p-D-glucopyranosyl( 1 —»4)]- α -L-arabinopyranoside has<br>
antitumor activity, particularly, against solid tumors.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors isolated deoxypodophyllotoxin from medicinal herbs<br>
including Anthriscus sylvestris Hoffman, Pulsatillae radix, etc., and found that this<br>
substance inhibited the growth of solid tumor cells by inhibiting angiogenesis, and<br>
obtained a Korean patent (Korean Patent Number 315,200) for the same. The present<br>
inventors carried out extensive studies to develop an antitumor agent from medicinal herbs.<br>
As a result, they obtained a fraction which is poorly soluble in an organic solvent, but is<br>
readily soluble in water from Pulsatillae radix, and isolated an antitumor compound from<br>
the fraction, and so completed the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a therapeutic agent<br>
for solid tumors comprising an antitumor compound isolated from Pulsatillae radix or a<br>
fraction from Pulsatillae radix containing the-same as an active ingredient.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a therapeutic agent for solid tumors<br>
comprising a Pulsatillae radix extract containing hederagenin 3-O-a-Lrhamnopyranosyl(<br>
l-2)-[p-D-glucopyranosyl(l--4)]-a-L-arabin as an active<br>
ingredient.<br>
"Solid tumors", as used herein, refer to any mass tumor except blood cancers, a<br>
representative example of which is lung tumor.<br>
In the present invention, the Pulsatillae radix extract containing hederagenin 3-0-<br>
a-L-rhamnopyranosyl( 1 —&gt;2)-[p-D-glucopyranosyl( 1 —»4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside can be<br>
obtained by extracting Pulsatillae radix with an aqueous solution of ethanol, and forming<br>
precipitates by adding acetone thereto to obtain a water-soluble fraction (WT). Or, it can<br>
be obtained by extracting Pulsatillae radix with the aqueous solution of ethanol, forming<br>
precipitates by adding acetone thereto to obtain the water-soluble fraction, and passing the<br>
fraction through Sephadex LH20 column to obtain a fraction (SPX3) having Rf of 0.48-0.5,<br>
and developing red color, and then, blue color upon spraying sulfuric acid followed by<br>
heating.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a therapeutic agent for solid<br>
tumors comprising hederagenin 3-0- α -L-rhamnopyranosyl(l—&gt;2)-[(3-Dglucopyranosyl(<br>
l—»4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside as an active ingredient.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention wi41 be explained in detail.<br>
According to the present invention, Pulsatillae radix extract is extracted with 50%<br>
ethanol to obtain a fraction WT poorly soluble in acetone, and the fraction is further<br>
purified on Sephadex LH20 to obtain fraction SPX3, and from the SPX3 fraction, pure<br>
SB365 is finally obtained. This compound is hederagenin 3-O-a-Lrhamnopyranosyl(<br>
1 —&gt;2)-[p-D-glucopyranosyl( 1 —&gt;4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside, and exhibits<br>
higher antitumor activity against solid tumors formed with mouse lung tumor cells, LLC<br>
(Lewis Lung Carcinoma) cells, or human lung tumor cells, NCI-H23 cells, than a clinical<br>
drug, adriamycin.<br>
In particular, the present process for preparing an antitumor fraction from<br>
Pulsatillae radix and isolating an antitumor substance therefrom is as follows.(1) Preparation of antitumor fraction WT from Pulsatillae radix<br>
Pulsatillae radix powder was extracted with 50% aqueous solution of ethanol, and<br>
dried under reduced pressure. To the obtained dried material was added acetone at 5 to<br>
10-fold amount. The mixture was shaken, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and the<br>
supernatant was decanted therefrom to obtain an insoluble part. The above process was<br>
repeated twice. The remaining insoluble part was readily soluble in water, and so<br>
designated as "fraction WT". This fraction showed relatively high antitumor activity<br>
against BDF1 mice transplanted with LLC cells and nude mice transplanted with NCIH23<br>
cells.<br>
(2) Preparation of fraction SPX3 from fraction WT<br>
A given amount of fraction WT is dissolved in a given amount of aqueous<br>
solution of methanol at various concentrations, and then fractionated on Sephadex LH20<br>
column stabilized with the same solvent. In this case, the best isolation is achieved with<br>
employing 80% aqueous solution of methanol, and the suitable size of the filled column<br>
was 60*4 cm for 500 mg of fraction WT. As a result, fraction SPX1 (test tube numbers<br>
26-66), SPX2 (test tube numbers 66-91), SPX3 (test tube numbers 91-111), and SPX4 (test<br>
tube numbers 111-138) were obtained. When spraying sulfuric acid onto the fractions<br>
developed on a silica gel plate and heating the plate, the fraction SPX3 developed red color<br>
at first, and blue color with the lapse of time, and contains a sported compound having Rf<br>
of 0.48 to 0.50 as a main ingredient. It was shown to have high antitumor activity on<br>
BDF1 mice transplanted with LLC cells and nude mice transplanted with NCI-H23 cells.<br>
(3) Isolation of SB365 from fraction SPX3<br>
To isolate an antitumor substance from the fraction SPX3 showing antitumor<br>
activity, HPLC was carried out to obtain pure compound, SB365. To identify the<br>
structure of SB365, Lieberman-Burchard reaction, IR, 'H-NMR, I3C-NMR, and<br>
ethanol/sulfuric acid hydrolysis were carried out. As a result, SB365 was confirmed as<br>
hederagenin 3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(l-2)-[-D-glucopyranosyl(l—»4)]-a-Larabinopyranoside,<br>
which is a saponin ingredient that had already been isolated from<br>
Pulsatillae radix.<br>
The Pulsatillae radix extracts according to the present invention or pure SB365<br>
compound isolated therefrom have a weak cytotoxicity against solid tumor cells, but<br>
unexpectedly showed excellent antitumor activity in animal experiments. Thus, they can<br>
improve problems caused by previous antitumor agents on clinical use, e.g. reducing<br>
immune responses due to decreasing blood cells. It is also anticipated that they show low<br>
toxicity on rapidly dividing cells like hematopoietic cells, etc.<br>
The Pulsatillae radix fractions and SB365 according to the present invention may<br>
be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are conventionally used, and<br>
manufactured into various formulations that are conventional in the pharmaceutical field,<br>
for example, orally administrable formulations like solutions, suspensions, etc.; injectable<br>
formulations like injeetable solution or suspension, ready-to-use injectable dry powder,<br>
etc.; and topically administrable formulations like ointments, creams, and solutions.<br>
Particularly, the active ingredient of the present invention is soluble in water, and may be<br>
dissolved in various solutions such as physiological saline, Ringer's solution, and nutrient<br>
solution, etc. Such pharmaceutical formulations may be intravenously, subcutaneously,<br>
intraperitoneally, or topically administered.<br>
A recommended dosage of the active ingredient of the present invention to human<br>
beings is 3.5-8.0 mg/kg body weight in case of SB365, 20-40 mg/kg body weight in case<br>
of fraction SPX3, or 200-300 mg/kg in case of fraction WT. The. optimal dosage is 6.5<br>
mg/kg body weight in case of SB365, 25 mg/kg body weight in case of fraction SPX3, or<br>
250 mg/kg body weight in case of fraction WT. However, such dosage may be<br>
appropriately adjusted depending on age, body weight, health, severity of disease of<br>
patients.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
This invention will be better understood from the following examples. One<br>
skilled in the art will readily appreciate the specific materials and results described are<br>
merely illustrative of, and are not intended to, nor should be intended to, limit the invention<br>
as described more fully in the claims, which follow thereafter.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of fraction WT<br>
Pulsatillae radix powder of 50 g was extracted three times with 500 ml of 50%<br>
aqueous solution of ethanol, and the extract was dried under reduced pressure to obtain 22<br>
g of dried materials. To this dried materials was added 300 ml of acetone, and the<br>
mixture was shaken and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed<br>
therefrom to give a precipitate. For this precipitate, the acetone treatment was repeated<br>
twice. The acetone layer was discarded, and an insoluble part was dried to obtain 17.8 g<br>
of dried materials (fraction WT). The obtained fraction WT was subjected to silica gel<br>
TLC (developing solvent: butanol : acetic acid : water in the ratio of 4 : 1 : 1, color<br>
reaction: sulftiric acid-spraying followed by heating). The result is shown in Fig. 1. In<br>
Fig. 1, a blue spot having the Rf in thiwange of 0.48 to 0.50 corresponds to the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention as described below. As shown in Experimental<br>
Example 1 below, fraction WT showed relatively high antitumor activity (inhibition rate of<br>
tumor growth: 57%) on BDF1 mice transplanted with LLC cells.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of fractions SPX<br>
Fraction WT of 560 mg was further fractionated on Sephadex LH20 column (200<br>
g, 60&gt;
mt/min, and the fraction volume of 0.5 ml/tube. These fractions were spotted on a silica<br>
gel thin layer in order, and developed to obtain factions (developing solvent: butanol :<br>
acetic acid : water in the ratio of 4 : 1 : 1, color reaction: sulfuric acid-spraying followed by<br>
heating). The result is shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, SPX1 (139 mg, 24.8%) was obtained<br>
by collecting test tube numbers 26 to 66, and consisted of 4 major spots, lower one of<br>
which developed yellow color upon reacting with sulfuric acid. SPX2 (344 mg, 61.4%)<br>
was obtained by collecting test tube numbers 66 to 91, and consisted of 2 major spots.<br>
SPX3 (61 mg, 10.9%) was obtained by collecting test tube numbers 91 to 111, and<br>
developed red color at first, and then blue color with the lapse of time, upon spraying<br>
sulfuric acid followed by heating. Fraction SPX3 contained a spot having the Rf value in<br>
the range of 0.48 to 0.50 as its major ingredient. SPX4 (15.7 mg, 2.8%) was obtained by<br>
collecting test tube numbers 111 to 138. Fractions SPX3 and SPX4 had relatively high<br>
purity showing one spot on the thin layer.<br>
As shown in Experimental Example 1 below, SPX3 exhibited 60% of the<br>
inhibition rate of tumor growth on 15 days from its administration. By contrast, SPX1,<br>
SPX2, and SPX4 did not exhibit any action, and so it could be assumed that the substance<br>
developing blue color against sulfuric acid was an ingredient with antitumor activity.<br>
This SPX3 fraction may be used as an antitumor agent in itself.<br>
Example 3: Isolation of SB365<br>
In order to isolate a pure substance from fraction SPX3, HPLC was carried out as<br>
follows.<br>
Reverse-phased silica gel (RP-Cig, 250*10 mm, manufactured by Metachem) was<br>
used as the fixed phase, and a mixed solution of methanol and water (80:20) was used as<br>
the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 210 nm, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, SPX3 consisted of 3 major substances.<br>
From the obtained fractionated amounts, peaks at Rt of 8.5 min and 10.4 min contained<br>
small amounts of ingredients, and a peak at Rt of 23.3 min contained the major ingredient.<br>
Thus, it was assumed that the latter would have antitumor activity. As described above,<br>
the substance with R, of 23.3 min that developed blue color with sulfuric acid and would<br>
be the active ingredient was collected to obtain SB365 of 2.8 mg from 31 mg of SPX3.<br>
The collected fraction at R, of 23.3 min was dried, and was subjected to HPLC under the<br>
condition as described above to measure its purity. The result is shown in Fig. 4. From<br>
Fig. 4, it was confirmed that SB365 was a pure substance. The obtained SB365 was<br>
directly used for the structural identification and antitumor activity test below.<br>
As shown in Experimental Examples 1 and 2 below, SB365 exhibited 81% and<br>
82.1% of the inhibition rate of tumor growth on BDF1 mice transplanted with LLC cells<br>
and nude mice transplanted with NCI-H23 cells, respectively, which could be said to be<br>
excellent antitumor activities.<br>
Example 4: Structural identification and confirmation of the active compound SB365<br>
SB365 isolated in the above was the white amorphous form with m.p, 239~241 °C<br>
and [a]n +23.6° (c, 0.2, MeOH), and was positive in Liebermann-Buchard reaction, and so<br>
confirmed as a glycoside. In addition, according to IR (cm"1), peaks were observed at<br>
3400 (br, -OH), 2940 (br, C-H), 1695 (CO), 1455, and 1040 (C-O).- Jt was also assumed<br>
as a glycoside from the absorption peaks in the ranges of 1000-1100 and 3000-3400.<br>
In view of 'H-NMR, it had NMR patterns typical of saponins. Six -CH3 groups<br>
were observed at 0.91, 0.92, 0.98, 1.00, 1.07, and 1.21 ppm, and another -CH3 group was<br>
observed as doublet at 1.64 ppm. It could be seen from this that the compound comprised<br>
one rhamnose group in its sugar groups. Anomeric protons were observed at 6.25 (br.),<br>
5.11 (1H, .1=7.80 Hz), and 4.97 ppm (1H, J=6.66 Hz). Therefore, SB365 was confirmed<br>
as a glycoside having three sugar groups.<br>
According to I3C-NMR, a hydroxymethyl group was observed at 65. 4 ppm (C-<br>
23), and three anomeric carbon signals was observed at 104.2 (C-T), 106.7 (C-l'"), and<br>
101.7 pprn (C-T). Two olefinic carbons were observed at 122.5 ppm (C-12) and 144.8<br>
ppm (C-l3), and one carboxy carbon was observed at 180.2 ppm (C-28). In general,<br>
about 4 Hz of glycosylation upfield shift is shown when sugar is bound at the 28 position<br>
(180.2 ppm—&gt;176.2 ppm). In the present compound, the above phenomenon was not<br>
observed, and so it was confirmed that the compound does not have a sugar group in the 28<br>
position.<br>
Subsequently, the compound was hydrolyzed in ethanol/sulfuric acid to identify<br>
its sugar groups and the structure of aglycone. SB365 was confirmed as hederagenin<br>
after comparing physicochemical data of the hydrolysis product, aglycone, 13C-NMR, and<br>
'H-NMR data. Further, the hydrolyzed sugars were confirmed as rhamnose, arabinose,<br>
and glucose by comparative TLC.<br>
On the basis of the above analysis results and data in published literatures, SB365<br>
was confirmed as hederagenin 3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl((l—&gt;2)-[(3-Dglucopyranosyl(<br>
1 -&gt;4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside.<br>
H-NMR and "C-NMR data of SB365 are as shown in the following Table 1.<br>

Experimental Example 1: Antitumor activity on BDFl mice transplanted with LLC<br>
cells<br>
The mouse species used in this experiment was BDFl, and healthy male mice<br>
with the body weight of 18-25 g were used. These animals were supplied with water and<br>
foods ad libitum at a place of controlled temperature in the range of 23-24 °C, and were<br>
bred with an antibiotic-free mouse feed. LLC cells were subcutaneously cultured in<br>
C57BL/6 mice for 14 days. A LLC cell-containing tissue was taken and thereto was<br>
added sterilized cold physiological saline water (5 ml/g tissue) to prepare a cell suspension.<br>
The cell suspension of 0.2 ml was subcutaneously transplanted to the groin region of BDFl<br>
mouse.<br>
From 24 hours after transplantation, the above mice were divided into several<br>
groups consisting of 5 mice. Then, samples, fractions WT and SPX fractions, and SB365,<br>
were dissolved in physiological saline, and were injected intraperitoneally at each<br>
concentration of 280 mg/kg (WT), 70 mg/kg (SPX1), 171 mg/kg (SPX2), 30.5 mg/kg<br>
(SPX3), 8.1 mg/kg (SPX4), and 6.4 mg/kg (SB365). To the negative control group was<br>
injected only the physiological saline, and to the positive control group was injected<br>
adriamycin (0.5 mg/kg). The injection was scheduled from 24 hours after tumor<br>
transplantation to administer the samples successively once a day for 7 days, and stopped<br>
for one day, and then, was carried out for 6 more consecutive days.<br>
In order to evaluate toxicity of SB365 on mice, experimental mice were weighed<br>
twice a week. Antitumor activity was calculated after measuring tumor volume of the<br>
control and test groups on 14th and 15th day after sample administration as follows:<br>
Tumor volume (mm3) = length (mm) x width2 (mm2) / 2<br>
Inhibition rate of tumor growth (%) = (C - T) x 100 / C<br>
(C: average tumor volume in the control group, T: average tumor volume in the<br>
The result is shown in the following Table 2.<br>

a) Days after transplantation of tumor cells<br>
As shown in the above Table 2, fractions WT and SPX3 showed the inhibition rate<br>
of tumor growth of 55% and 60%, respectively, and SB365 showed the inhibition rate of<br>
tumor growth of 79%, higher than adriamycin of 64% on 15th day from transplantation of<br>
tumor cells.<br>
Experimental Example 2: Antitumor activity on nude mice transplanted with NCIH23<br>
cells<br>
Female nude mice of the age of 5 weeks weighing 16-25 g obtained from Harlan<br>
Co. (USA) were used as experimental animals in this experiment. The mice were used<br>
after acclimation for 1 week in an aseptic animal room. The animal room maintained the<br>
temperature of 22±2 °C, the humidity of 55±5%, and the light and darkness cycle of 12<br>
hours, which was automatically controlled. Solid feed for experimental animals was<br>
radiosterilized, and drinking water was sterilized in an autoclave. The animals were<br>
supplied with feed and drinking water ad libitum. A human tumor cell line provided by<br>
National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, and preserved in the Korean Research Institute of<br><br>
Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRffiB), Korea, was used. Lung tumor cells, NCI-H23<br>
cells, among the human tumor cells, were transplanted to the nude mice. The tumor cells<br>
of 3&gt;
body weight. The samples were intraperitoneally injected to the mice every day for 13<br>
days, that is, from 1 day to 14th day except 8th day after tumor cells transplantation. The<br>
size of tumor formed during the injection was measured in each animal, and any change in<br>
its body weight was also measured. On 16th day after tumor cells transplantation, the<br>
nude mice were sacrificed, and the tumor was separated and weighed. To the positive<br>
control group was intraperitoneally injected adiamycin of 0.5 mg/kg body weight on 1st,<br>
5th, 9th, and 14th day. The result is shown in the following Table 3.<br>

a): Days after tumor cells transplantation<br>
As shown in the above Table 3, SB365 of 6.4 mg/kg showed a high inhibition rate<br>
of tumor growth, 82.1%, on 16th day after tumor cells transplantation.<br>
Experimental Example 3: Cytotoxicity test<br>
Tumor cells A549, SK-MEL-2, and MCF-7 were obtained from the KRIBB, and<br>
used in this experiment. A culture medium was prepared by adding one pack of Lglutamine-<br>
containing RPMI1640 medium, 100 ml of fetal bovine serum (FBS) inactivated<br>
by heating at a water bath of 50 °C for 30 minutes, 2 g of NaHCO3, 100,000 units of<br>
penicillin, and 1-00 mg of streptomycin, to a sterilized distilled water for injection,<br>
adjusting the pH of the mixture with 0.1 N HC1 to a total volume of 1 1, and disinfecting<br>
the mixture with filtration, and stored at 4 °C before use. The cells were maintained by<br>
propagation once every three days, and a solution containing 0.5% trypsin and 2% EDTA<br>
in physiological buffered saline (PBS) was used to detach the cells from wells.<br>
Cytotoxicity on tumor cells was measured according to Sulforhodamine-B (SRB)<br>
method developed by the NCI in 1989 to measure in vitro antitumor activity of drugs.<br>
Specifically, the cells were detached from wells with 0.5% trypsin-EDTA solution<br>
and then, 3--5*104 cells/ml of cell suspension was prepared. Then, the cell suspension<br>
(180 µl/well) was added to 96-well plate, and the plate was incubated in an incubator of 37<br>
"C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours.<br>
The sample was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with the<br>
culture medium or tertiary distilled water to obtain required concentrations for experiment,<br>
and serially diluted to a final concentration of DMSO of 0.2% or less. To each well of<br>
96-well plate were added 20 µl of the serially diluted sample solutions, and then, the plate<br>
was incubated in an incubator of 37 °C, 5% CC&gt;2 for 48 hours. At the point of time to add<br>
the sample solution, Tz (Time zero) plate was collected. Medium was removed from Tz<br>
plate and from each plate after completing the incubation, and to the plates was added 10%<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (50 µl/well). The resulting plates were allowed to stand for 1<br>
hour at 4 "C to immobilize the cells on the bottom of the plates. After completing the cell<br>
immobilization, the plates were washed 5~6 times with water to completely remove the<br>
remaining TCA solution, and the resulting plates were dried at room temperature to contain<br>
no moisture.<br>
To the completely dried plates was added 50 µl of a staining solution with 0.4%<br>
SRB in 1% acetic acid to stain the cells for 30 minutes. Then, the plates were washed<br>
5-6 times with 1% acetic acid solution to completely remove SRB unbound to the cells.<br>
The plates were dried at room temperature. Thereto was added "100 µl of 10 mM Tris<br>
solution to dissolve the dye. Then, OD (optical density) value was measured by<br>
microplate reader at a wavelength of 520 nm.<br>
ED50 value of the sample on tumor cells [50% effective dose (ng/ml): a<br>
concentration at which tumor cell growth is inhibited by 50%] was calculated as follows.<br>
T7 value was defined as OD value at the time of starting the incubation after adding the<br>
sample, C (control) value as OD value of the well not treated with the sample, and T (test)<br>
value as OD value of the well treated with the sample. From the values Tz, C, and T,<br>
cytotoxicity of the agent was measured by the following formula:<br>
- in the case of Tz &gt; T, (T - Tz) / (C - Tz)x 100<br>
- in the case of Tz 
From the values as calculated above, ED50 value of the sample was obtained by<br>
using data regression function of Lotus program.<br>
As a result, ED$o value of SB365 on human lung tumor cells, A549 cells, human<br>
melanoma cells, SK-MEL2, and human breast tumor cells, MCF7 was &gt;20 µg/ml, &gt;10<br>
µg/ml, and &gt;10 µg/ml, respectively. Therefore, SB365 had little cytotoxicity on solid<br>
tumor cells.<br>
