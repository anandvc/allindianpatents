COLD   BREW TEA<br>
The present invention generally relates to a cold water infusible tea leaf, to processes for obtaining such leaf and to the improved7 5  cold water infusion products thereby obtained.<br>
Background<br>
10  Black tea is traditionally produced from fresh green tea leaves (Camellia   sinensis)   by a process comprising four major steps: withering, rolling, fermentation and firing.  Withering is a process whereby the freshly plucked green tea leaves are stored until the moisture content is reduced to about 55-72% of the leaf<br>
15  weight. The withered leaves are crushed by rolling or maceration in order to break down the leaf cell structure and bring enzymes and the substrate polyphenols into contact. During fermentation the simple flavonoids in green tea leaf are oxidized by endogenous tea enzymes to produce the polyphenols that impart a bright red<br>
20  color and the astringent flavor to black tea. Tea fermentation is truly an enzymatic process and is not the typical fermentation used in brewing of alcoholic beverages.  Two enzymes, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase catalyze the oxidation of simple catechins to the more complex polyphenols; namely theaflavins (TF) and<br>
25   thearubigens (TR).<br>
Fermented teas are fired (dried) with hot, dry air reducing the moisture content of the leaves to less than 5%.  Firing of teas arrests fermentation by inactivating enzymes and results in 30  development of color and flavor from chemical oxidation and<br>
creates the final balance of tea aroma.  Following drying, the leaves are then sorted and graded to yield a commercial black tea product.  The process of tea manufacture is described in great<br>
-2-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
detail by Robertson 1992 (Tea:   Cultivation  to  Consumption.   Wilson, K. C. and Clifford, M.N., Eds., Chapman Hall, London)<br>
Tea beverage is prepared from the black tea leaf manufactured by 5  the above process by infusing the tea leaves loose or in a tea bag in hot freshly boiled water for a few minutes.  After removing the tea leaf, the beverage is then consumed hot or cold as iced tea.<br>
It is well known that the majority of the tea consumed in the U.S. 10  is iced tea prepared by cooling down tea beverage .brewed using hot<br>
freshly boiled water, by dissolving instant tea powders in water<br>
or in the form of ready-to drink teas in cans, bottles or cartons.<br>
Iced tea prepared from tea leaf with boiling water has the fresh<br>
brewed tea flavor/astringency enjoyed around the world.  However, 15  the steps of boiling water and cooling down can be time consuming,<br>
generally taking more than 30 minutes before the ice tea beverage<br>
is ready for consumption.<br>
Convenient as cold water soluble tea powders can be, for many 20       consumers the quality of the final beverage is not equal to that prepared from hot infused leaves.   Many consumers prefer not to use instant tea powders as they perceive them to be lacking the fresh brewed tea taste and of inferior quality.<br>
15       Accordingly, a leaf tea that can rapidly infuse in cold water to produce an iced tea beverage with the color and flavor of the traditionally hot brewed iced tea would offer the consumer a convenient option to both traditional leaf tea and powdered tea products. The benefit of a cold brew tea product is two folds, the<br>
iO  convenience of not having to boil water and wait for it to cool down, and the fresh brewed tea taste.<br>
There are numerous methods for making cold water soluble tea powders including U.S. 4,051,264 and U.S. 3,812,266.  European<br>
3<br><br>
6<br>
patent specification EP 760,213 Al (Unilever) discloses a method<br>
of enhancing color in a tea-based foodstuff.  The method involves<br>
using a tannase pre-treatment (on leaf or extract) followed by<br>
treatment with exogenous peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide to<br>
5  generate cold-soluble color.	<br>
International patent publication WO 97/40699 (Unilever) concerns tea processing with zeolites to generate color.  There are examples of adding zeolite following tannase treatment to generate 10  cold-water soluble tea.<br>
U.S. 4,639,375 discloses treating black tea with tannase, together with other cell-wall digesting enzymes, to generate cold-water soluble instant tea powders.<br>
15<br>
*When conventional teas are extracted with cold water for short periods of time (less than 15 minutes) , the tea beverage produced has a low concentration of extractable tea solids, a Very light color and almost no tea-1"ike taste.  Water at temperatures of<br>
20  about 100° C is usually employed to obtain a satisfactory beverage with prior art tea leaves.<br>
It has now been discovered that by appropriate selection of tea leaves, which are, in turn, subjected to appropriate processing, a<br>
25  cold brew tea beverage can be obtained.  It is now possible to<br>
obtain a leaf tea that rapidly infuses and remains soluble in cold water to give a beverage with good color and flavor that is as acceptable to consumers as iced tea made from a hot infused black leaf tea.  Furthermore, this product can be made from infusions of<br>
30  tea obtained by modifying the traditional black tea manufacturing process.<br>

Statement of the Invention<br>
In broad terms the invention relates to a cold brew tea beverage prepared by the cold brew method said beverage having taste and 5  color parameters so that<br>
i.   when a Q.D.A. test is performed evaluation Bitter2<br>
and Red, and<br>
ii.  when Bitter2 is plotted on a Q.D.A. map as the Y axis<br>
10	and red is plotted on said map as the X. axis<br>
the beverage has a Q.D.A. score on or above the line defined by: Bitter2 + 0.639 Red &gt; 4.8.<br>
15  The inventive product is used to prepare a beverage with good color and taste by infusion in cold water. The product is comprised of 100% tea leaves and excludes the addition of instant tea powder or the coating of tea extracts onto the tea leaves.  In other embodiments, the product may employ powders, extracts or<br>
20  colorants.  The product infuses in cold water and can be used to produce an iced tea beverage with the color and flavor comparable to iced teas prepared by hot brewing methods.<br>
In summary, this invention encompasses a tea leaf product that 25  rapidly brews in cold water to produce a beverage with color and flavor characteristics substantially identical to hot brewed iced tea beverages and a process of manufacturing cold infusing black tea leaf.  This product and  processes for its preparation will be described in detail in the "Detailed Description of the 30  Invention".<br>

"Tea" for the purposes of the present invention means leaf material from Camellia  sinensis  var.   sinensis  or Camellia  sinensis var.   assamica.     It also includes herbal teas such as rooibos tea obtained from Aspalathus linearis,  however, most herbal teas are a 5  poor source of endogenous fermenting enzymes." "Tea" is also<br>
intended to include the product of blending two or more of any of these teas.<br>
"Leaf tea" for the purposes of this invention means a tea product 10  that contains leaves of one or more tea origins in an uninfused form.<br>
"Cold water infusible" for the purposes of this invention means giving good color, flavor and mouthfeel in a short infusion time, 15  i.e., less that 10 minutes, but preferably within 5 minutes at a temperature at or below about 15° C.<br>
As used herein, the word "comprising" is intended to mean including but riot necessarily "consisting essentially of", 20  "consisting of" or "composed of".  In other words, "comprising" the listed steps or options need not be exhaustive.<br>
Except in the examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or 25  conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about." All amounts are by weight of the composition, unless otherwise specified.<br><br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Evaluation of Cold Brew Product by Sensory Descriptive Analyses<br>
i.e. Qualitative Descriptive Analysis (or.Q.D.A.)		,<br>
5<br>
The color and flavor, including mouthfeel, of iced tea beverages govern their acceptability.  A Qualitative Descriptive Analysis<br>
(Q.D.A.) test method was selected to systematically characterize and quantify tea beverages based on color, flavor, and mouthfeel. 10  The Q.D.A. method employs a trained panel of expert tasters to quantify the color, flavor and mouthfeel attributes of iced tea beverages relative to defined reference standards.<br>
Expert tasters were chosen by screening prospective panel members 15  for ability to taste standard solutions of acid (citric acid) , . salt (sodium chloride) , sweet (sucrose) , and bitter (caffeine)., that represent high to low levels (grams per liter) of each flavor attribute as defined in the following table.<br><br>
Acid	Bitter	Salt	Sweet<br>
0.6	0.5	2.0	12.0<br>
0.4	0.3	1.0	4.3<br>
0.2	0.2	0.5	1.6<br>
0.1	0.1	0.2	0.5<br>
20<br>
Individuals who were able to identify and differentiate the flavor of each test solution at the lowest concentration qualified for participation as an expert taster and were trained to describe and quantify tea beverages using a defined set of attributes to 25  describe color, flavor and mouth feel.<br>
Through a mathematical technique known as Principle Component Analysis four attributes, bitterness (also called bitterness2 or bitter 2 in this application which refers to the bitter aftertaste 30  rather than initial bitterness), smoothness, redness and<br>
.-"7-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
.<br>
yellowness  were   found to be  useful   for differentiating  iced  tea<br>
beverages.     Expert panelists   (a minimum of  eight)   were  selected<br>
and  trained  to  describe   iced tea beverages  by  rating  the   intensity<br>
of each  key attribute   (bitterness,   smoothness,   redness,   and;   -   -<br>
5      yellowness}   M a seals of 1-10 by exposing  the  tasters  to "extremes<br>
of each  attribute.     For example  an  infusion of whole  leaf<br>
Darjeeling  tea  may be used  to define bitterness   and yellowness  and<br>
an  infusion  of Argentine  tea may be  used  as   an  example  of  redness<br>
and smoothness.       Once  trained the  expert  tasters  were  tested<br>
10       through blind  evaluations  of iced tea beverages   representing  low<br>
to  high  levels   of each attribute,   provided  in  random order.<br>
Expert   tasters   evaluated each  sample  at   least   3   times   to  be<br>
assured that  panelist ratings  were  consistent   and  reproducible.<br>
To determine  the  range  of attributes   that  defines   hot brewed iced<br>
15      teas,   a  variety of teas  that represent  a broad  sampling  of  the<br>
world  of  teas  were evaluated by the  trained panel   after being<br>
prepared by  three distinct methods  of brewing.   All  of the  water<br>
was   carbon-filtered tap water.     Brewing Method   1   (full   flavored<br>
brew method)   involved the preparation  of  a   concentrate   followed by<br>
20      dilution   to  final  bevetage  strength.     Six  pitcher  or  family  size<br>
tea  bags   each  containing about  7.13  grams   of  tea   leaf were   brewed<br>
in  two quarts   of hot  freshly boiled water  for   30 minutes   followed<br>
by dilution  to  beverage  strength with  an  additional   two  quarts  of<br>
cold water making  a gallon  of beverage.	Brewing Method   2    (mild<br>
25       flavored brew method)   was   a  single   strength   infusion  rather   than  a concentrate  preparation.      In  contrast   to  Method   1,   the   tea   bags were  brewed with  the  full  amount  of boiled  water   (four  quarts)   for three  minutes.      Brewing Method 3,   designed   for   the   cold brew  tea leaf  product,   was  used  for  the  preparation  of  the   inventive 30      product  and  all   reference  teas.     Six  pitcher  or   family  size   tea bags   were   infused  in one  gallon of  cold   (60°   F  or   15°C)   carbon filtered  water  by dunking  the bags   several   times   each minute during  the  £ minute brewing  time.<br>
-8-<br><br>
—-<br>
Product evaluations  were  conducted in  Sensory booths   where   the trained expert  tasters  ranked the  teas   on  a  1-10   scale   for bitterness,   smoothness,   redness,   and yellowness.   The   samples  were served blind,   identified only by a three-digit  code  and presented 5      in  three replications  using a balanced block design.      Flavor<br>
assessment  was  done  under red  lights.     Appearance   was   done  under white  light.   The  result of  this  type  of  test  over   several different panels,   while possibly not  being an  exact match   as   to absolute  values,   will  still   statistically  show  the   same   relative 10      differences  between  the products.<br>
The  teas may be  distinguished as  those  which when   cold  brewed are poor in color or   flavor and  are  generally  lacking   in  the   desirable tea  attributes  as   compared to  the  teas   of  the   invention  having<br>
15      good color  and taste  and generally attributes   that   are   like   those of hot brewed  teas.     The method for defining the   teas   is   as    .;/. follows:   by plotting each color attribute   (red or  yellow)   vs.   a mouthfeel  attribute   (bitter  or  smooth),   using  averaged  scores  of the panelists,   plots  are produced which  show the   inventive   teas  as<br>
20      superior  to other  cold brewed  teas.<br>
The groupings that result indicate that the world of teas along with the described inventive tea fall in a region of the graphs that  is  distinct   from simply  cold brewing  all   other   teas   in   the<br>
25      data  set.     The defining  region  of  the   group,   or  Q.D.A.   map   that<br>
relates  to  the  invention,   is   shown  in   figures   1,   2,   3   and   4   where teas  lying   in  the   region  defined by  equation  1,   2,   3   and   4, describe  the  area  of  applicants"   invention.     The   teas   lying outside  of  this  defined region  represent   cold brewed   teas   selected<br>
30      from the  world of   teas   that   lack  the  preferred  qualities   by<br>
comparison.     The   type  of  tea,   the method  of  brewing  and   the  data points  produced by   the Q.D.A.   analysis   are   reported  in  Table   1 below.<br>

25  Processes for Preparing Cold Water Infusible Leaf<br>
There may be many methods of preparing tea leaves that infuse in cold water. This invention describes processes for preparing black tea leaf that unlike conventional black tea leaf, when infused in 30  cold water, produces tea with color and taste superior than using conventional black leaf for cold infusion.<br>
One method, which is preferred, is a tannase peroxide method described in a companion co-pending application T98-034(C).<br>
12<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Tannase/Peroxide Process:<br>
When conventional tea leaves are extracted with cold water for short periods of time (less than 15 minutes) , the tea beverage 5  produced has a low concentration of extractable tea solids, a very light color and almost no tea-like taste.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method, freshly plucked green tea leaves are withered and macerated in the normal way using any of 10  the techniques known to those skilled in the art of tea manuf a"cturing.<br>
In a first departure from traditional black tea manufacture, the macerated leaves are treated with tannase (flavanol gallate 15  esterase) to generate degallated catechins and gallic acid.  This subsequently leads to the generation of theaflavins, epitheaflavic acids and non-gallated thearubigens during fermentation (which are more cold water soluble than the gallated ones).<br>
20  The general reaction catalyzed by tannase is the cleavage of<br>
gallate ester linkages, both on gallated catechins and also from other gallated compounds within the leaf.  Tannase is also well known to improve the clarity of tea products since galloyl groups are important in tea cream formation and tannase has been used<br>
25  extensively for \the degallation and solubilization of black tea cream.  The tea is fermented under solid state conditions.<br>
The tannase can be applied using a variety of known techniques. It is preferred to dissolve tannase in water, spray the solution 30  onto the macerated tea or dhool and leave the mixture to react for a suitable time at suitable fermentation temperatures.  The tannase is applied to the dhool after an initial maceration (for example, a first CTC cut) in a fine spray followed by subsequent cutting (for example, a second or third CTC cut) to ensure<br>
13<br><br><br>
adequate mixing.  The dhool is preferably incubated under vacuum or under anaerobic conditions for example in an atmosphere of nitrogen to prevent fermentation.  It is preferable that complete degallation takes place before fermentation starts as this"results 5  in maximal formation of gallate ester free theaflavin,   ~   ~ epitheaflavic acids and thearubigens during the subsequent fermentation, which in turn leads to optimal cold soluble color generation.<br>
10  A method has been developed for bringing certain exogenous<br>
compounds into contact with endogenous compounds found in tea. This involves vacuum infiltrating macerated tea leaves with those exogenous compounds to modify certain properties of tea and tea based beverages.  For example, an infusion of tannase pre-treated<br>
15  tea has been found to have more than double the total theaflavin content of a control and a six-fold increase in theaflavin 1.<br>
Vacuum infiltration is a technique that is often used in the preparation of protoplasts from plant tissue, albeit to introduce<br>
20  substances between rather than into cell walls.  Cut tea leaf tissue is incubated in a solution containing tannase.  The suspension is then placed under vacuum and air is drawn from the intracellular spaces  of the leaf particles, the enzyme solution is drawn in to replace it.  It has been found that a vacuum of less<br>
25  than 100 mbar is suitable for this.<br>
The major constraint when applying this method to tea dhool is achieving access within the cells.  Another major problem is that large volumes of water can seriously affect the quality of the tea 30  by reducing oxygen uptake during fermentation.  Vacuum<br>
infiltration is a useful tool for introducing enzymes, for example tannase, into solid state dhool.  When fermented, tannase treated dhool gives rise to black tea with high levels of theaflavin and no gallated species.  This enables one to produce a range of novel<br>
14<br><br><br><br>
teas.  Vacuum assisted tannase treatment is much more effective in removing gallated species and enhancing additional theaflavin formation than the equivalent treatment under ambient temperature and pressure.  The vacuum allows the enzyme to penetrate the 5  tissue and remove gallated species prior to fermentation, the key feature of tannase driven theaflavin enhancement, compared to simply applying the enzyme onto fermenting dhool and mixing in by hand.<br>
10  If at all possible the conditions should be adjusted to prevent any fermentation prior to or during tannase treatment.  This can be achieved by using a stronger vacuum pump, holding the dhool under N2 sparge or shortening the tannase treatment.<br>
15  Tannase can be applied to the macerated tea by a simple dosing. However, spraying the tannase in a fine mist is preferable,as it aids infiltration.<br>
Suitable conditions can be readily determined by experiment.  Good 20  results have been obtained with tannase in an amount of 10 mg/kg dhool but preferably between 40 and 80 mg/kg dhool.  The activity of tannase is 50,000 units per gram.<br>
Fermentation is preferably carried out at a pH in the range of 4.0 25  to 6.5.  The fermentation temperature is preferably in the range<br>
15 to 40° C.  Fermentation is preferably carried out for a time in the range 30 to 150 minutes, more preferably 105 to 120 minutes.<br>
Furthermore, in a second departure from traditional black tea 30      manufacture hydrogen peroxide is added, after a time that is sufficient to generate gallic acid and theaflavin during the fermentation step, to activate  (or at least greatly enhance the activity of) endogenous tea leaf peroxidase.<br>
-15<br><br><br>
Tea is known to contain natural peroxidase at high levels.  It is also known that natural peroxidase can be activated (or have its activity enhanced) through the addition of hydrogen peroxide in a slurry system.  J. Sc.   Food Agric. vol. 32, p 920-032 (Dix.,1981) discloses such a system and process.  The article mentions that peroxidase can oxidize tea polyphenols to form theaflavins, and also thearubigens that may be similar and different to those produced under "normal" fermentations.  However, it does not offer any detailed understanding as to the chemistry at work.<br>
It has been found that the endogenous peroxidases have the potential to oxidize catechins to theaflavins and thearubigens, convert theaflavins to thearubigens and, unlike endogenous polyphonol oxidase, readily oxidize gallic acid to form epitheaflavic acids.  The combination of these reactions generates significant amounts of colored compounds that are soluble in cold water.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide is added in. an amount that is sufficient to activate endogenous peroxidases and oxidize gallic acid liberated by the tannase treatment.  One skilled in the art can determine that by experiment.  It is preferred to use between 100 and 200 ml of 2.0 to 2.5% hydrogen peroxide per kg dhool, but preferably 160 ml of 2.0% hydrogen peroxide per kg dhool.  Under normal conditions of tea manufacture, peroxidase is largely inactive, due to the low endogenous levels of hydrogen peroxide and high activities of catalase.  Measurements have shown that all added hydrogen peroxide is consumed during the process, with none remaining in the final made tea.  In contrast to the findings disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. 4,051,264, it has been found that the combination of tannase treatment and subsequent activation of peroxide is critical for the manufacture of a product that gives good color and acceptable taste.  Product that was only tannase treated had a "sour" or "metallic" note and dose<br>
16-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
not produce a tea beverage with acceptable color when brewed in cold water.<br>
The method of the invention will now be described with reference 5  to Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
10  Lab scale process<br>
Process steps  - 60 mg tannase dissolved in 24 ml water was sprayed onto 100 g of frozen dhool.  The dhool was then thawed under N2 and once it had reached 20° C, it was placed under vacuum<br>
15   (50 mbar) for 60 minutes.  The dhool was then fermented for 60 minutes at 25° C, 100% RH.  After fermentation the dhool was sprayed with 12.5 ml ~2% hydrogen peroxide solution, placed under vacuum for 15 minutes and then dried by a fluid bed drier.  One can increase the level of theaflavins by pre-treating the dhool<br>
20  with tannase.  Peroxide is added to activate the endogenous tea<br>
peroxidase.  This enzyme oxidizes theaflavins and the gallic acid released by tannase to give dark, cold water soluble pigments.<br>
25  Alkaline Treatment Process<br>
In another embodiment of the invention a cold soluble tea ingredient t is prepared by selective alkaline treatment of black tea leaves.  The alkaline treated black tea leaf rapidly infuses 30  in cold water providing color to iced tea beverages and when appropriately mixed in selected amounts with other black teas results in a cold infusible beverage with the full complement of tea flavor and color associated with the corresponding prior arc processes.  It is important that the particle size of the tea<br>
- 17-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
ingredient and the resulting leaf tea product be of a suitable size to allow rapid and full infusion in cold water. This alkaline treated product in selected amounts about 5% to 25% then may be added to highly flavored tea about 75% to 95% to produce a cold 5  water infusible tea leaf product with both good color ancf^gocxf: taste.<br>
As mentioned above, the alkaline treatment step includes conversion of tea compounds to highly colored species.<br>
10<br>
In this embodiment, it is found that tea leaf products which are capable of producing a high quality tea beverage upon brewing with either cold or hot water and which have a substantially reduced level of cold water insoluble solids are obtained by contacting<br>
15  black tea leaf with alkali, thereafter, neutralizing the alkali with acidic reagents, drying the leaf and combining it with selected highly flavored teas.<br>
The resulting leaf tea blends produce beverages prepared from cold 20  water which have a full measure of the organoleptic properties of prior art tea leaf products brewed with hot water.  The products of the invention have the unique property of producing high quality tea beverages when brewed with cold water, whereas prior art conventional tea leaf products are only poorly extracted by 25  cold water.  For this reason, prior art tea leaf products require boiling water to prepare a full-flavored beverage.<br>
Particle size control is necessary for non alkaline treated leaves and desirable for alkaline tea to break up agglomerated particles 30  treated; a minimum size is required so it does not dust through tea bags and produce haze.  Flavor and color of the tea are improved with decreasing particle size as shown in Figure 5.<br>
18-<br><br><br><br>
This second embodiment of the invention will now be described in Example 2.<br>
5   EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this Example, color was measured using the Hunter Lab DP 9000 with a sample path length of 5 cm.  The color was analyzed by means of the L value.  Control values refer to the color before 10  treatment.<br>
The Alkaline Treatment Process and a test procedure to evaluate the final product is given below.<br>

Tea leaf	20 lbs.<br>
45% KOH	12 lbs.<br>
Water	9 lbs.<br>
95.7% Sulphuric Acid	3.7 lbs.<br>
Water	9.0 lbs.<br>
Procedure<br>
20  The KOH and water were mixed and the diluted caustic solution was added to the 20 lbs. of tea leaf.  The slurry was mixed well.  The temperature of the leaf was raised to 77° C and the slurry was aerated and mixed well for five minutes.  3.7 lbs. of sulfuric acid was mixed with 9 lbs. of water and added to the alkaline<br>
25  oxidized leaf to neutralize it.  The neutralized leaf was dried to about 3 to 7 % moisture at about 70° C.<br>
19-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Product Evaluation<br>
2.27 grams of dry Alkaline Treated Leaf was added to a 300 ml beaker and 200 ml of 15° C tap water was added to the beaker.  The slurry was stirred several times every minute" for five minutes and the leaf was separated from the extract by filtration through tea paper.  A one-quarter dilution of the extract was prepared by mixing 50 ml of the extract with 150 ml of tap water.  The diluted extract was then evaluated with a Hunter Colorimeter.<br><br>
10<br><br>
A Hunter L value of about 15-25 and a Hunter should be obtained for this sample.<br><br>
value of 20-25<br><br>
15  EXAMPLE 3<br><br>
20<br><br>
A series of tests were run to evaluate the cold infusion Hunter L value of a broad sampling of teas.  The alkaline treated tea of -the invention was compared for color and produced an overwhelmingly better color.<br><br>
The teas were brewed and their Hunter L values are presented in Table 2 below.<br><br>

The "cold infusion" Hunter L Value is a measurement of color obtained by adding 2.27 gram of tea leaves in a bag to 200 ml of carbon filtered tap water at 15° C and infusing the bag for five minutes with occasional stirring.  Separating the bag from the liquid extract, adjusting the pH to 5.0 with dilute H2S04/ diluting 50 ml of the extract to 200 ml with deionized water and measuring in a Hunter DP 9000 Colorimeter.  Other parameters were described earlier in the Q.D.A. analysis above where the alkaline treated tea is designated number 2 from Table 1.<br>
The tea of Example 3 was placed in a bag and used to prepare fresh brewed iced tea using a cold water infusible black tea leaf bag that delivers the equivalent flavor and color of hot-brewed iced tea.  The cold water infusible tea bag contains 82.5% highly flavored teas having smaller particle sizes so   that they infuse more easily and quickly in cold water and 17.5% alkaline oxidized tea to boost the color.<br>
A preference test was conducted comparing iced tea made using the cold water infusible tea bag (brewed for" 5 minutes using 60° F water and cooled to 40° F) to iced tea made from commercial Lipton® family size tea bags (hot brewed for 3 minutes and cooled to 40° F) .  The respondents were given the option of putting the additives they normally put into fresh brewed tea (lemon, sugar, and aspartame).  No significant differences in "liking scores" were detected between the cold water infusible tea and the hot brewed Lipton iced tea.  Both samples were rated slightly above "like slightly" and 31 respondents preferred the hot brewed iced tea compared to 18 preferring the cold brewed iced tea.<br>

EXAMPLE   4<br>
Instant Tea Coating Method<br>
5  A third and less  preferred method of preparing cold infusion  tea is to treat standard tea leaves with instant tea powder or to coat the tea leaves with tea extracts.  Instant tea powders or solutions may also be employed alone or in combination with other colorants but these products would not be considered 100% leaf tea 10  formulations.  Depending on the manufacture of the" powder or tea concentrate, low amounts as well as  high amounts of these tea ingredients may be added in sufficient quantities to provide color of a typical hot brew tea product.  Products made by this method are expected to have a less preferred flavor. 15<br>
