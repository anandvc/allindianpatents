				<td>A frequency inversion scrambler in a cordless telephone utilizes an integrated high-pass filter (14) between a first stage low-pass filter (12) and modulator (16) to reduce the filter order while maintaining low group delay in the audio signal. The first stage low-pass filter and high-pass filter remove high frequency components and any DC offset from the filtered audio signal. The modulator translates the spectrum of the filtered signal to sum and difference frequencies. A second stage low-pass filter (18) removes the upper portion of the spectrum such that the resulting frequency spectrum is inverted with respect to the original audio signal to prevent eavesdropping of transmissions between the handset and base unit of the cordless telephone. Another frequency inversion circuit (30, 32, 34, 36) in the base unit inverts the frequency spectrum again back to its original state for transmission along telephone lines.</td>

				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   an   integrated   frequency   inversion scrambler circuit for use in a voice transmission apparatus.<br>
Background  of  the  Invention<br>
The  present  invention  relates   in  general  to  cordless telephone  systems  and,   more  particularly,   to  a  frequency inversion  scrambler  in  a  cordless  telephone.<br>
Cordless  telephones  are  widely  used  in  residential  and commercial  environments  because  of  their  flexibility  in allowing  the  user  to  venture  some  distance  from  the  base unit  during  the  conversation.     The  user  speaks  into  the handset  microphone  and  the  voice  data  is  transmitted  by  RF link  to  the  base  unit.     The  base  unit  sends  the  voice  data across  hard-wire  telephone  lines  to  the  party  on  the  other end.     Voice  data  from  the  other  party  is  also  received  by the  base  unit  and  transmitted  over  the  RF  link  to  the handset  to  complete  the  two-way  conversation.<br>
A  common  problem  with  many  cordless  telephones   is  the lack  of   security  and  privacy   in  the  conversation.      It   is possible  for  non-parties  to  pick-up  the  same  RF communication  link,   e.g.   by  way  of  another  cordless telephone  nearby  or  other  RF  receiver,   and  hear  the  private conversation.      In  the  prior  art,   frequency  inversion scramblers  have  been  used  to  add  privacy  to  the  phone conversation  by  scrambling  voice  data  transmitted  over  the RF  link.     Briefly,   a  frequency  inversion  scrambler  inverts the  transmitted  frequency  spectrum  so  that  non-parties  with standard  cordless  telephones  cannot  understand  the conversation.      The  base  unit   for  the  handset   inverts   the frequency  spectrum  again  to  unscramble  the  voice  data  back to   its  original  state  for  transmission  over  the  telephone lines.<br>
One  prior  art  implementation  of  the  frequency inversion  scrambler  has  a  low-pass  filter  receiving  audio signals   and  a   series   capacitor  between  the   low-pass   filter and  a  modulator.     The  series  capacitor  blocks  any  DC  offset<br>
in  the   audio   signal  as   required  for  proper  modulation.      The modulation   creates   sum  and  difference   frequencies   about   the modulation  frequency.     The  modulated  audio  is  again  low-pass   filtered  to  remove  the  modulation  frequency  and  higher frequencies  before  transmission  to  the  base  unit.      The remaining  frequency  spectrum  is   inverted  with  respect  to the  original  audio  signals  and  thus  cannot  be  understood with  standard  cordless  telephones.     The  base  unit  includes a   similar  low-pass   filter  and  series   capacitor   into   a modulator  to  re-invert  the  spectrum  back  to  its  original state.     Another  low-pass   filter  coupled  to  the  output  of the  modulator  removes  the  modulation   frequency  and  higher frequencies  and  provides  the  base-band  voice  data  for transmission  across   conventional   telephone   lines.<br>
The  low-pass   filters   in  the   frequency   inversion scrambler  are  typically  high  order,   say   10th-14th  order,   to provide  the  proper   frequency  response.      The   low-pass   filter after  the  modulator  needs   to  be  high  order   for  suppression of  the  modulation  frequency  and  higher  frequencies   in  order to  isolate  the  inverted  frequency  spectrum.     Unfortunately, a  higher  order  filter  also  tends  to  increase  group  delay through  the  filter  which  reduces  voice  quality.      It   is impractical  to  move  the  modulation   frequency  farther  from baseband  and  use  a  lower  order  low-pass   filter  because  low frequency  voice  data  would  be   lost  due  to   the   limited frequency  operating  band.      In  addition,   the  series capacitors  are  sufficiently  large  as  to  require  external placement  and  associated   IC  pins.<br>
Hence,   a  need  exists   for   frequency   inversion scrambler  with  lower  order  filters  to  reduce  group  delay while  maintaining  adequate   suppression  of  the  modulation frequency  and  higher   frequencies.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an integrated frequency inversion scrambler circuit for use in voice transmission apparatus, comprising:<br>
a first low-pass filter having an input coupled for receiving an audio input signal;<br>
a first high-pass filter having an input coupled to an output of said first low-pass filter, characterized by:<br>
said first high-pass filter having an autozero to remove internal DC offset in said first high-pass filter;<br>
a first modulator having first and second inputs and an output, said first input being coupled to an output of said first high-pass filter, said second input being coupled for receiving a first modulation signal; and<br>
a second low-pass filter having an input coupled to said output of said first modulator and having an output for providing a frequency inverted audio signal. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a frequency inversion scrambler; and<br><br>
FIGs.   2-7  are  waveform  plots  useful   in  the  explanation of   FIG.   1.<br>
Detailed  Description  of  the  Preferred  Embodiment<br>
Referring  to  Fig.   1,   a   frequency  inversion  scrambler circuit  10   is   shown  for  use  in  a  cordless   telephone. Frequency  inversion  scrambler  10  comprises  low-pass   filter 12   receiving  an  analog  input  signal  TX  IN  as   audio  data originating   from  a  microphone   in  the  cordless  telephone handset   (not  shown).      The  output  of   low-pass   filter  12   is coupled  to  an   input  of  high-pass   filter   14.      The  output  of high-pass   filter  14   is  coupled  to  a  first  input  of modulator  16.      The  second  input  of  modulator  16   receives  a frequency  modulation  signal  operating  at  3.96   KHz.      The output  of  modulator  16   is  coupled  to  an  input  of  low-pass filter  18.      The  output  of  low-pass   filter  18   is   coupled  to an  input  of  FM  transmitter  20  that  transmits  a  modulated  RF signal,   typically  46  to  49  MHz,   over  transmission  medium 22,   e.g.   airways,   to  FM  receiver  24   in  the  base  unit  of  the cordless  telephone.      The  de-modulated  output  of  FM  receiver 24   is   coupled  to  an  input  of   low-pass   filter  30.     The output  of  low-pass   filter  30   is   coupled  to  an   input  of high-pass   filter   32..      The  output  of  high-pass   filter   32   is coupled  to  a  first  input  of  modulator   34.      The  second   input of  modulator  34  receives  a  similar  frequency  modulation signal  operating  at  3.96   KHz.      The  output  of  modulator  34 is   coupled  to  an  input  of  low-pass   filter   36.      The  output of  low-pass   filter  36  provides  the  RX  OUT  output  voice  data for  transmission  over  conventional  TIP  and  RING  telephone lines   (not  shown).<br>
The   function  of   frequency  inversion   scrambler   10   is   to scramble  the  transmitted  audio   signal  so  that  it  can   not  be understood  by  non-parties  operating  other  cordless   phones, baby  monitors,   RF  scanners  or  any  other  FM  receivers   that operate   in  the   same   frequency  range  as  the  cordless telephone.      In  most  applications,   two   frequency   inversion<br>
scramblers  are  used  in  the  cordless  telephone  with  one  in the  handset  and  one  in  the  base  unit.     Low-pass   filter  12, high-pass   filter  14,   modulator  16,   low-pass  filter  18   and FM  transmitter  20  are  part  of  transmit  side  of  the  cordless telephone  handset.      FM  receiver  24,   low-pass   filter  30, high-pass   filter  32,   modulator  34,   and  low-pass   filter  3 6 are  part  of  receive  side  of  the  base  unit  of  the  cordless telephone.      It  is  understood  that  another  frequency inversion  scrambler  is  required  for  the  transmit  side  of the  base  unit  and  the  receive  side  of  the  handset  of   the cordless  telephone,   i.e.   from  the  telephone  lines  through the  base  unit  to  the  earpiece  on  the  handset.<br>
The  operation  of   frequency  inversion  scrambler  10 proceeds  as   follows.     Assume  the  user  of  the  handset  speaks into  its  microphone  during  a  telephone  conversation.     Voice signals   in  the  audio  band,   approximately  0.3  to  3.3   KHz, are  acoustically  coupled  to  the  microphone,   amplified  by its  ancillary  circuitry  and  applied  as  TX  IN  to  the   input of  low-pass   filter  12.     The  TX  IN  signal  passes  though  low-pass   filter  12  where  the  frequencies  higher  than  the  audio band  are  attenuated.      Low-pass   filter  12   is   a  fourth-order Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter  having  a  corner frequency  of   3.5   KHz.      The  corner  frequency  determines   the high  frequency  corner  of  the  final  frequency  response   for RX  OUT  and  is   chosen  to  be  slightly  higher  than  3.3   KHz   so as   to  avoid  eliminating  any  of  the  usable  spectrum  as   a result  of  processing  variations.     The  corner  frequency  of low-pass   filter  12  must  be  sufficiently  removed  from  the modulation  frequency  so  the  modulation  signal   is  attenuated without  having  to  use  a  large  number  of  poles  that  may increase  group  delay  and  reduce  voice  quality.      Low-pass filter   12   has   0.4   dB  of  ripple  across   its  pass-band  and   30 dB  of   stop-band  attenuation.      The  group  delay  through   low-pass   filter   12   is   0.12   ms.      Low-pass   filter   12   may  be implemented  in  differential  or  single-ended  form.      The voltage  gain   (Av)   of   low-pass   filter   12   is   two   for differential   and  one   for  single-ended  versions.      A  clock<br>
signal  operating  at  165.16   KHz  controls   the  switched capacitors   (not  shown).     The  details  of  constructing  a fourth-order  low-pass   Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter are  determined  by  the  aforedescribed  specifications.<br>
As  part  of  the  present  invention,   the  low-pass filtered  signal  at  the  output  of  low-pass   filter  12   is applied  to  an   integrated  high-pass   filter  14.      In  the present  embodiment,   high-pass   filter  14   is   an  integrated second-order  Chebychev  switched-capacitor  filter  having  a corner  frequency  of  165  Hz.     The  corner  frequency  of  high-pass   filter  14   is   set  below  the  lowest  desired  low frequency  response   in  order  to  reduce  group  delay  within the  audio  band.      High-pass   filter  14   has   0.4   dB  of  ripple across   its   pass-band,   a  group  delay  of  0.03  ms,   and  Av=l for  both  differential  and  single-ended  applications.      A clock   signal   operating  at   23.59   KHz   controls   the   switched capacitors.     High-pass  filter  14  attenuates   low  frequencies below  the  audio  range  and  blocks  any  DC  offset   in  the  audio signal.      High-pass   filter  14   includes  an  auto-zero   feature to  reduce  any  internal  DC  offset.      By  using  an  integrated high-pass   filter,   two   IC  pins  and  one  external  capacitor commonly  used  on  prior  art  are  eliminated.      The  details  of constructing  an  integrated  second-order  high-pass  Chebychev switched-capacitor  filter  are  determined  by  the aforedescribed  specifications.<br>
FIG.   2   illustrates   the   frequency  spectrum  of  the  audio signal  at  the  output  of  high-pass   filter  14.      Frequencies above   3.5   KHz   and  below  165   Hz  are  attenuated  as  described above.      The  negative   frequency   spectrum  represents   the mirror   image  of  the  positive   frequency  audio   signal.<br>
The  filtered  signal  at  the  output  of   high-pass   filter 14   is  applied  to  double-balanced  modulator  16  where   it  is mixed  with  a  modulation   frequency  slightly  greater  than  the high  frequency  corner  of  the  baseband  spectrum.      In  the present   example,   the  modulation   frequency   is   3.96   KHz. Modulator   18   translates   the   spectrum  of   the   filtered   input signal   to   frequencies   equal   to   the  modulation   frequency<br>
plus  and  minus  the  frequency  of  the   filtered  input  signal to  the  modulator.     Modulator  18  typically  has  a  voltage gain  of  2/π.     FIG.   3   illustrates  the  response  of  mixing  all<br>
frequencies   in  the  spectrum  defined  by  low-pass   filter  12 and  high-pass   filter  14.     The   7.46   KHz  break  comes   from 3.96   KHz   +3.5   KHz  while  the  460  Hz  break  results   from  3.96 KHz   -   3.5   KHz.<br>
The  output  of  modulator  16   is  applied  to  low-pass filter  18.      The  corner  frequency  of   low-pass   filter   18   is determined  by  the  desired  low  frequency  corner   (260  Hz)   of the  final  response  RX  OUT  in  that  the  low  frequency  corner is  the  difference  between  the  modulation   frequency  and  the corner   frequency  of  low-pass   filter  18,   e.g.   3.96   KHz   -   3.7 KHz.     As  a  result,   the  corner  frequency  of   low-pass   filter 18   can  be  set  higher  than  that  of   low-pass   filter  12   in order  to  optimize  low  frequency  performance  without adversely  effecting  group  delay.<br>
In  the  present  embodiment,   low-pass   filter  18   is  a sixth-order  Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter  with  a corner   frequency  of   3.7  KHz.     Low-pass   filter  18   has   0.6  dB of  ripple  across   its  pass-band  and  50  dB  of   stop-band attenuation.      The  group  delay  through  low-pass   filter   18   is 0.175  ms  and  Av=π/2   to  counter  the  2/π  voltage  gain   from<br>
modulator  16.     A  clock  signal  operating  at  165.16   KHz controls  the  switched  capacitors.      The  details  of constructing  a  sixth-order  low-pass  Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter  are  determined  by  the  aforedescribed specifications.<br>
FIG.   4   shows   the  resulting  spectrum  at  the  output  of low-pass   filter  18.      Note  that  the   frequency  spectrum  is the  inverted  image  of  the  spectrum  at  the  audio   input signal  TX  IN.      The  frequency  inverted  scrambled  signal   is frequency  modulated  to   RF  using   conventional   techniques   and transmitted  by   FM  transmitter   20   in   the   handset  over transmission  medium  22  and  received  by  FM  receiver  24   in the  base  unit.      Any  non-party  operating  a  standard  cordless telephone  nearby,   or  other  RF  receiver,   would  not  be   able<br>
to  understand  the  frequency  inverted  audio  signal.      The conversation   is  thus  maintained  as  private.<br>
The  frequency  inverted  scrambled  signal  received  at the  base  unit  is   first  demodulated  back  to  baseband  by  FM receiver  24.      The  function  of  low-pass   filter   30,   high-pass filter   32,   modulator  34,   and  low-pass   filter  3 6   in  the  base unit  is  to  de-scramble  the  audio  signal  by  performing another   frequency  inversion  to  return  the  audio  signal   to its  original  state  for  transmission  over  the  telephone lines.<br>
Low-pass   filter  30   is  a  second-order  Elliptic switched-capacitor  filter  with  a  corner  frequency  equal  to 3.7   KHz.     Low-pass   filter  30   attenuates   frequencies   above 3.7   KHz  to  eliminate  any  high  frequencies  acquired  during transmission  while  minimizing  additional  group  delay.      Low-pass   filter  30  has   0.6  dB  of  ripple  across   its  pass-band and  22  dB  of  stop-band  attenuation.      The  group  delay through  low-pass   filter  30   is   0.04  ms  and  Av=2   for differential  applications  and  Av=l   for  single-ended applications.     A  clock  signal  operating  at  165.16   KHz controls  the  switched  capacitors.      The  details  of constructing  a  second-order  low-pass   Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter  are  determined  by  the  aforedescribed specifications.<br>
As  another  part  of  the  present  invention,   the  low-pass filtered  signal  at  the  output  of   low-pass   filter  30   is applied  to  an   integrated  high-pass   filter   32.      In  the present  embodiment,   high-pass   filter  32   is  an  integrated second-order  Chebychev  switched-capacitor   filter  having  a corner   frequency  of   165   Hz.      The  corner  frequency  of   high-pass   filter  32   is   set  below  the  lowest  desired  low frequency   response   (260   Hz)   in  order  to   reduce   group   delay within  the  audio  band.     High-pass   filter  32  has   0.4  dB  of ripple  across   its  pass-band,   a  group  delay  of   0.03   ms,   and Av=l.      A  clock  signal  operating  at  23.59   KHz   controls   the switched  capacitors.      High-pass   filter   32   attenuates   low frequencies   below  the   audio   range   and  blocks   any  DC  offset<br>
in  the  audio  signal.     High-pass  filter  32   includes  an  auto-zero   feature  to  reduce  any  internal  DC  offset  as   is  well known.     By  using  an  integrated  high-pass  filter,   two  IC pins  and  one  external  coupling  capacitor  commonly  used  on prior  art  are  eliminated.     The  details  of  constructing  an integrated  second-order  high-pass  Chebychev  switched-capacitor  filter  are  determined  by  the  aforedescribed specifications.<br>
FIG.   5   illustrates  the   frequency  spectrum  at  the output  of  low-pass   filter  30   similar  to  that  at  the  output of  low-pass   filter  18.     Frequencies  above  3.7   KHz  and  below 460  Hz  are  attenuated  as  described  above.<br>
The  filtered  signal  at  the  output  of  high-pass   filter 32   is   applied  to  double-balanced  modulator  34  where   it  is mixed  with  a  modulation  frequency  slightly  greater  than  the high  frequency  corner  of  the  baseband  spectrum.      In  the present  example,   the  modulation  frequency  is   3.96   KHz. Modulator  18   translates  the  spectrum  of  the  filtered   input signal  to  frequencies  equal  to  the  modulation  frequency plus  and  minus  the   frequency  of  the  filtered  input  signal to  the  modulator.     Modulator  34  typically  has  a  voltage gain  of   2/Π.      FIG.   6   illustrates   the  response  of  mixing  all<br>
frequencies   in  the  spectrum  defined  by  low-pass   filter  30 and  high-pass   filter  32.     Note  the  lower  corner  of  the frequency  spectrum  has  been  defined  by  the  difference between  the  modulation  frequency  and  the  corner  frequency of   low-pass   filters   18   and   30.      The  7.66   KHz   break  comes from  3.96   KHz   +   3.7   KHz  while  the   260   Hz   break   results   from 3.96   KHz   -   3.7   KHz.<br>
The  output  of  modulator  34   is   applied  to   low-pass filter  36.     The  corner  frequency  of   low-pass   filter   36 determines  the  high  frequency  corner  of  the  final   frequency response  and   is   chosen  to   be   slightly  higher  than   3.3   KHz so  as   to  avoid  eliminating  any  of  the  usable  spectrum  as   a result  of  processing  variations.      The  corner   frequency  of low-pass   filter   36   must  be  sufficiently  removed   from  the modulation   frequency   to   adequately   suppress   the  modulation<br>
frequency  while  maintaining  voice  quality  by  avoiding unnecessarily  long  group  delays.<br>
In  the  present  embodiment,   low-pass   filter   36   is  an eighth-order  Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter  with  a corner  frequency  of   3.5  KHz  to  define  the  upper  corner  of the  final  frequency  response  RX  OUT.     Low-pass   filter  36 eliminates  any  modulation  frequency,   baseband  frequency,   or intermodulation  product  breakthrough  and  thus   improves  the voice  quality.      Low-pass   filter   36   has   0.6   dB  of   ripple across   its  pass-band  and  50  dB  of  stop-band  attenuation. The  group  delay  through  low-pass   filter  18   is   0.25  ms   and AV= π/2  to  counter  the  voltage  gain  of  modulator  34.     A  zero<br>
is  placed  in  the  frequency  response  at  the  modulation frequency   3.96   KHz   to   further  attenuate  the.  modulation frequency.     A  clock  signal  operating  at   165.16  KHz   controls the  switched  capacitors.     The  details  of  constructing  an eighth-order  low-pass   Elliptic  switched-capacitor  filter are  determined  by  the  aforedescribed  specifications.<br>
FIG.   7   shows  the  resulting  spectrum  at  the  output  of low-pass   filter  36.      Note  the   frequency  spectrum  has  been re-inverted  back  to   its  original  form.     The  audio  signal  RX OUT   is  transmitted  out  across   conventional  telephone   lines. Another   frequency  inversion  scrambler   is  required  for  the transmit  side  of   the  base  unit  and  the  receive  side  of   the handset   for  complete   two-way  private   communications.<br>
By  now  it  should  be  appreciated  there  has  been provided  a  frequency   inversion  scrambler  with  integrated high-pass   filter  between  the   first  stage  low-pass   filter and  the  modulator.     The  frequency  inversion  scrambler  with high-pass   filters   improves  voice  quality  by  reducing  group delay  while  using   lesser  order   low-pass   filters.      Moreover, the  integrated  nature  of  the  high-pass   filters  reduces  die size  and  eliminates  external  capacitors  and  associated   IC pins  common   in  the  prior  art.<br>
While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, further modifications and improvements  will  occur  to   those  skilled   in  the  art.      It   is<br>
understood  that  the  invention  is  not  limited  to  the particular  forms   shown  and  it  is   intended  for  the  appended claims   to  cover  all  modifications  which  do  not  depart   from the  spirit  and  scope  of  this   invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
