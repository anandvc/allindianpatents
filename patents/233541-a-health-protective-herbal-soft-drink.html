now said that there will be more dieticians than physician in the present century as<br>
many diseases can be prevented if the right kind of diet is prescribed. Herbs into our<br>
lives in an ongoing way, it is easier to modify an existing habit than to create a new<br>
one. Consumption of the right kind of food articles and drinks suited to the climate,<br>
age and constitutional, natures of the individuals are getting greater scientific security<br>

drink and with the modern scientific understanding of beverages have designed herbal<br>
soft drink. This drink is fortified with many health protective and promotive attributes<br>
such as hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant and immuno-enhancing, besides providing<br>
instant energy and vitality. These properties have been authenticated/validated<br>
through appropriate pharmacological investigations and clinical studies. The drink is<br>
diuretic and has cooling effect like other soft drinks of summer. The result will be a<br>
boon to consumers, in terms of herbal alternatives and availability.<br>
