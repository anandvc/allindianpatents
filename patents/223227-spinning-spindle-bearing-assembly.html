THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SPINNING SPINDLE BEARING ASSEMBLY"<br>
HOLDING FUR INDUSTRIEBETEILIGUNGEN AG, of Bafflesstrasse 14, 9450 Altstatten, Switzerland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a spinning bearing assembly.<br>
The process of converting natural and synthetic fibres into yarn requires a series of working steps. The last working step in the process is normally referred to as fine spinning where the spun yarn acquires its final degree of finesse and strength. The demands of fine spinning represent a substantial share of the entire yarn manufacturing process with regard to the time required, investments as well as the energy consumption. Ring spinning sufficiently known from the state of the art comes closest to classic hand spinning with spinning wheels. As on the classic spinning wheel, the spun yarn is wound onto a rotating spindle. Differing from the classic spinning wheel that features only one spinning spindle rotating at a relatively slow speed, in the case of a ring spinning frame, a large number of spinning spindles, e.g. up to 500 and more, are arranged on a spindle bank, onto which the spun yarn is wound. In this case, the spinning spindles are rotated at speeds ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 revolutions per minute.<br>
The spinning spindles normally used today feature an upper section, comprising a spindle stem, a drive wharve or whorl and a spindle top as well as a spindle bottom section that can be secured on a spindle bank and accept and supports the upper section of the spindle. The upper section of the spindle is supported by a radial spindle bolster or spindle collar that is normally designed as a roller bearing and a base bearing, normally designed as a plain friction bearing, serving as a support and guide bearing. The spindle bolster is normally located in a rigid arrangement within a support housing of the spindle bottom section while the base bearing is arranged such that it can move radially in a guide sleeve. This guide sleeve is rigidly connected to the support housing at its end facing the spindle bolster and is designed in such a way that the base bearing can move radially. The guide sleeve is normally formed as a steel tube that is weakened by indentations or<br><br>
recesses running radially or helically in the area between the fastening in the support housing and the support of the base bearing in order to achieve the required degree of lateral resilience or movement<br>
The drive wharve concentrically encompasses the support housing holding the spindle bolster or spindle collar and is connected such that it turns with the spindle stem. The spinning spindles are driven by means of a drive belt that rests tangentially on the outer surface of the drive wharve. The spindle bolster is arranged approximately at the level of the drive belt in the area of the drive wharve and essentially takes up the radial forces exerted by the drive belt. The diameter of the drive wharve has a direct influence on the force required for driving the spinning spindles. At a defined spindle speed, the drive belt as well as the tensioning pulley and idler pulley run faster the greater the diameter of the drive wharve. The smallest possible diameter of the drive wharve is determined by the outside diameter of the radial spindle bolster as well as the thickness of the support housing wall that encompasses the spindle bolster. In turn, the outside diameter of the spindle bolster is determined by the bearing load expected during operation and which essentially depends on the weight of the rotating spindle upper section and its rotational speed. The weight of the spindle upper section is determined to a large extent by the size of the spindle top or cop, onto which the yarn is spun. The cop size is normally standardized and is dependent on the further processing textile machines downstream.<br>
A very high spindle speed is aimed at, reaching a maximum of 25,000 revolutions per minute in connection with today's standard cop formats. These marginal conditions define the load of the spindle bolster during operation, which in turn defines the dimensioning, especially the outside diameter of the spindle bolster. DE-A-44 09 725 therefore describes how the roller bearings of the radial spindle bolster run directly on the inner surface of an extended, continuous, cylindrical outer bearing race. The section of the outer bearing race adjoining the bearing face for the rollers serves the purpose of fitting the radial bearing onto the support housing. The cylindrical outer race is normally connected to the support housing by means of a press fit. The extended section of the<br><br>
outer bearing race is either pressed over the end area or into the hole of the support housing. For strength reasons, the outer bearing race features a relatively large, uniform wall thickness over its entire extended length. The wall thickness is, however, a compromise between the required stability of the outer bearing race in the area of the rollers and the ductility of the extended section necessary for press fitting the radial bearing. Unwanted deformation of the inner surface of the outer bearing race can occur in the area of the rollers when pressâ€”fitting the radial bearing. This has a negative effect on the bearing quality, especially on the concentricity of the bearing and can impair the achievable maximum rotary speed of the spinning spindles.<br>
The task of this invention is therefore to address these, in part contradictory requirements and to redress the restrictions of state-of-the-art spinning spindle bearing assemblies while enabling the highest possible rotary speeds for the spinning spindles.<br>
The solution to this task is a spinning spindle bearing assembly in a ring in which a stem of a spinning spindle is supported by a spindle collar designed as a radial bearing with an outer bearing race and the base end of the stem is supported by an axial base bearing that is borne by a support housing extending in axial direction, the outer bearing race and the support housing being of a one-piece construction in the form of a cylindrical support/bearing sleeve that features a continuous bore and an annular collar which protrudes from the inner wall and divides the support/bearing sleeve into the support housing section and the outer bearing race with its inner wall forming a bearing face for the rollers of the radial bearing such that the rollers are supported axially on the annular collar that forms an integrated lower flanged ring, an outer surface of the outer bearing race merges into an outer surface of the support housing and forms an integral portion of an outer surface of the support/bearing sleeve , which outer surface of the support/bearing sleeve with inserted spinning spindle is located in radially spaced relationship immediately adjacent to a drive wharve which is provided on the stem of the spinning spindle.<br><br>
Further variants and/or advantageous versions of the invention are the subject of the dependent claims.<br>
The spindle collar or spindle bolster in a spinning spindle bearing assembly configured in compliance with the invention is designed as a roller bearing. The outer bearing race of the roller bearing and the support housing that extends in axial direction are of a one- piece design, i.e. as a cylindrical support/bearing sleeve. The support/bearing sleeve features a continuous bore and is divided by a protruding annular collar opposite the inner wall into a support housing section and the outer bearing race. The annular collar forms an integrated lower flange ring that supports the rollers of the radial bearing running on the inner wall of the outer bearing race.<br><br>
The one-piece design of the outer bearing race together with the support housing and the integration of the lower flange ring in a combined support/bearing sleeve completely avoids stress and strain that can occur during assembly of the radial bearing on the support housing and that can lead to eccentricity of the bearing face. The outside diameter of the combined support/bearing sleeve is defined by the outside diameter of the section forming the outer bearing race and dependent only on the dimensioning of the spindle bolster. Consequently, the outside diameter can be kept very small. In installed position, the drive wharve of the spinning spindle protrudes over the outer bearing race and with small radial spacing directly adjoins the outer bearing race. As a result, also the outside diameter of the drive wharve can be kept small so as to ensure the highest possible rotational speed of the spinning spindle at the specified rotational speed of a drive belt.<br>
The protrusion of the annular collar compared to the inner wall of the support/bearing sleeve is about 0.8 mm to 2.0 mm. Its axial thickness is approximately 2 mm to 4 mm. This dimensioning is sufficient to withstand the loads that are exerted during operation by the supported rollers.<br>
A thin-walled, cylindrical ring extension protrudes advantageously over the section of the support/bearing sleeve forming the outer bearing race. The shoulder formed in this way serves as a support surface for an upper flanged ring that closes off the radial bearing and protects it from soiling.<br>
The axial end section of the cylindrical ring extension is advantageously beaded or flanged in position so that the upper flanged ring is held captive.<br>
In an advantageous variant of the invention, only the bearing face for the rollers is hardened while the section of the support/bearing sleeve forming the support housing is unhardened. As the result of this hardening process, the bearing face for the rollers and<br><br>
subjected to higher stress and strain exhibits the greatest resistance to wear. The rollers of the bearing assembly can feature cylindrical or slightly curved roller surfaces. The rollers are preferably designed as cylindrical bearing rollers. The largest contact surface of the cylindrical bearing rollers additionally improves the resistance to wear.<br>
With the spinning spindle inserted in the support housing, the drive wharve being ratatably connected with the spindle stem, protrudes over the section of the support/bearing sleeve which forms the outer bearing race in such a way that a drive face provided on the outer surface of the drive wharve for a drive belt or the like is located approximately at the level of the bearing face for the rollers. The central contact of the drive belt in the area of the rollers ensures improved support while taking up tilt moments more effectively.<br>
Further advantages and features of the invention may be derived from the following description of version examples of the bearing assembly for a spinning spindle. The drawings show in schematic representation and partiy in axial sectional view:<br>
Fig. 1   A spinning spindle corresponding to the state of the art; and<br>
Fig. 2   An axial section of a spinning spindle with a spindle bolster corresponding to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a state-of-the-art spinning spindle 101 mounted in its operational position on a spindle bank B of a ring spinning frame. For this purpose, a spindle housing 108 features a flange 116 and is secured to the spindle bank B by means of a fastening nut M that is screwed onto an external thread on spindle housing 108. Spindle housing 108 accommodates a support housing 109. A radial spindle bolster 110 is press-fitted into an end section designed as a roller bearing arranged above the spindle bank B. The spindle<br><br>
bolster 110 exhibits a row of rollers 112 and is limited by a cylindrical outer race 111. The cylindrical outer race 111 is held by a press fit within the end section of the support housing 109. The support housing 109 encompasses and carries a guide sleeve 113 that is designed such that it-moves laterally. For this purpose, the guide sleeve 113 that is normally made of steel features helical recesses or indentations 114. At its end facing away from the spindle bolster 110, the guide sleeve 113 has a base bearing 115 that is normally designed as a plain friction bearing.<br>
The spindle housing 108 carries a spindle top section 102 that encompasses a spindle stem 103, a drive wharve or whorl 104 and a spindle top 107. When the spinning spindle 101 is assembled, the spindle stem 103 is inserted in the spindle housing 108 where it is supported axially by the base bearing 115. The spindle stem 103 is supported radially by the rollers 112 of the spindle bolster 110. The drive wharve 104 is firmly connected such it turns with the spindle stem 103 and encompasses the support housing 109 that protrudes axially over the spindle housing 108. The inner wall 106 of the drive wharve is located in the direct vicinity of the outer wall of the support housing 109. A drive belt that rotates the spinning spindle 101 rests tangentially on the outer face 105 of the drive wharve 104. As can be seen from the schematic representation, the outside diameter of the drive wharve is derived from the resulting dimensions for the required load bearing capacity of the spindle bolster 110 and the wall thickness of the support housing 109 with the spindle bolster 110 press-fitted into its end section.<br>
The spindle housing 108 is normally filled with oil that serves lubrication and damping purposes. Further damping elements can be provided that, in combined action with the oil, dampen the lateral deflection of the spindle stem 103.<br>
A version example of the spinning spindle shown in its normal operating position in Fig. 2 with a spindle bolster corresponding to the invention has the overall reference symbol 1. The spinning spindle 1 features a spindle housing 4 and a fitted spindle upper section 2. The spindle housing 4 is equipped with an extended flange 6 and has an outside thread 5 for mounting on a spindle bank of the ring spinning frame. The upper section of<br><br>
the spindle 2 comprises a spindle stem 3 that is supported radially by a spindle bolster 9. The spindle bolster 9 is designed as a roller bearing and features an outer bearing race 10 on the inner wall 11 c\i which the rollers 12 of the radial bearing run. The rollers 12 in this version example are designed as cylindrical rollers. The spindle top is not shown in this schematic representation.<br>
The spindle stem 3 is inserted in the spindle housing 4 and extends through a guide sleeve 17. The base of the spindle stem 3 is supported axially on a base bearing 20 mounted on the guide sleeve 17. The base bearing 20 is preferably designed as a plain friction bearing. The guide sleeve 17 is made of plastic, an oil-resistant PVC for instance. Consequently, the guide sleeve 17 has an additional damping effect and facilitates smooth running of the spinning spindle 1. The guide sleeve 17 is mounted in a support housing 8 that encompasses the guide sleeve 17 and protrudes in axial direction over the spindle housing 5. For this purpose, an annulus 19 is recessed in the inner wall of the support housing, into which a radial flexible retaining ring 18 is fitted. The retaining ring 18 is held with little radial play in the annulus 19, it can be extended radially and engages in a circumferential groove 22 in the guide sleeve 17.<br>
In compliance with the invention, the outer bearing race 10 and the support housing 8 are of one-piece design in the form of a support/bearing sleeve 7 that is held in the spindle housing 4. The combined support/bearing sleeve 7 has a continuous axial hole 71. A protruding, annular collar 14 opposite the inner wall of the support/bearing sleeve 7 divides the sleeve 7 into the support housing section 8 and the outer bearing race 10. The annular collar 14 simultaneously forms an integrated lower flanged ring, supporting the bearing rollers 12 arranged in a bearing cage 13. The radial protrusion of the annular collar 14 is approx. 0.8 mm to 2 mm. Its axial thickness is approx. 2 mm to 4 mm.<br>
The inner wall 11 of the outer bearing race 10 forms the bearing face for the rollers 12. The bearing face 11 is preferably hardened. The outer bearing race 10 is covered by a cylindrical ring extension 15 with a wall thickness distinctiy less than that of the outer bearing race 10. The ring shoulder 21 formed in this way supports an upper flanged<br><br>
