REAGENTS THAT BIND CCX-CKR2<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS<br>
[01] The present patent application claims benefit of priority to U.S.<br>
Provisional Patent Application No. 60/674,140, filed April 21, 2005, which is incorporated<br>
by reference for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] Chemokines constitute a family of small cytoldnes that are, inter alia,<br>
produced in inflammation and regulate leukocyte recruitment, activation and proliferation<br>
(Baggiolini, M. et al., Adv. Immunol. 55: 97-179 (1994); Springer, T. A., Annu. Rev. Physiol.<br>
57: 827-872 (1995); and Schall, T. J. and K. B. Bacon, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 6: 865-873<br>
(1994)). Chemokines are capable of selectively inducing chemotaxis of the formed elements<br>
of the blood (other than red blood cells), including leukocytes such as neutrophils,<br>
monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, including T<br>
cells and B cells. In addition to stimulating chernotaxis, other changes can be selectively<br>
induced by chemokines in responsive cells, including changes in cell shape, transient rises in<br>
the concentration of intracellular free calcium ions (Ca2+), granule exocytosis, integrin<br>
upregulation, formation of bioactive lipids (e.g., leukotrienes), expression of cytoldnes, and<br>
respiratory burst, associated with leukocyte activation, growth and proliferation. Thus, the<br>
chemokines are early triggers of the inflammatory response, causing inflammatory mediator<br>
release, chemotaxis and extravasation to sites of infection or inflammation.<br>
[03] Two subfamilies of chemokines, designated as CXC and CC<br>
chemokines, are distinguished by the arrangement of the first two of four conserved cysteine<br>
residues, which are either separated by one amino acid (as in CXC chemokines SDF-1, IL-8,<br>
EP-10, MIG, PF4, ENA-78, GCP-2, GROα, GROβ, GROγ, NAP-2, NAP-4,1-TAC) or are<br>
adjacent residues (as in CC chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-<br>
3,I-309). Most CXC chemokines attract neutrophil leukocytes. For example, the CXC<br>
chemokines interleukin 8 (IL-8), platelet factor 4 (PF4), and neutrophil-activating peptide 2<br>
(NAP-2) are potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils. The CXC chemokines<br>
designated MIG (monokine induced by gamma interferon) and IP-10 (interferon-γ inducible<br>
10 kDa protein) are particularly active in inducing chemotaxis of activated peripheral blood<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
lymphocytes. CC chemokines are generally less selective and can attract a variety of<br>
leukocyte cell types, including monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, T lymphocytes,<br>
granulocytes and natural killer cells. CC chemokines such as human monocyte chemotactic<br>
proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T<br>
Expressed and Secreted), and the macrophage inflammatory proteins la and 1β (MlP-1α and<br>
MIP-1β) have been characterized as chemoattractants and activators of monocytes or<br>
lymphocytes, but do not appear to be chemoattractants for neutrophils.<br>
[04] CC and CXC chemokines act through receptors that belong to a<br>
superfamily of seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors (Murphy, P. M.,<br>
Pharmacol Rev. 52:145-176 (2000)). This family of G-protein coupled receptors comprises a<br>
large group of integral membrane proteins, containing seven transmembrane-spanning<br>
regions. The receptors may be coupled to G proteins, which are heterotrimeric regulatory<br>
proteins capable of binding GTP and mediating signal transduction from coupled receptors,<br>
for example, by the production of intracellular mediators. Additionally chemokine receptors<br>
may act independently of G protein coupling. For instance the Duffy receptor expressed<br>
predominantly on red blood cells is a promiscuous chemokine binding receptor which is<br>
believed to act as a chemokine, removing chemokines from the circulatory environment.<br>
[05] Generally speaking, chemokine and chemokine receptor interactions<br>
tend to be promiscuous in that one chemokine can bind many chemokine receptors and<br>
conversely a single chemokine receptor can interact with several chemokines. There are a<br>
few exceptions to this rule; one such exception has been the interaction between SDF-1 and<br>
CXCR4 (Bleul et al, J Exp Med, 184(3): 1101-9 (1996); Oberlin et al, Nature, 382(6594):<br>
833-5 (1996)). Originally identified as a pre-B cell growth-stimulating factor (Nagasawa et<br>
al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 91(6): 2305-9 (1994)), SDF-1 has been the only reported<br>
human ligand for CXCR4. The SDF-1 gene encodes two proteins, designated SDF-1 a and<br>
SDF-1 p, by alternative splicing. These two proteins are identical except for the four amino<br>
acid residues that are present in the N-terminus of SDF-1β and absent from SDF-1α.<br>
[06] There are many aspects of chemokine receptor signaling and<br>
selectivity for ligands that were not previously understood. For example, there are a number<br>
of orphan receptors for which no function has been previously determined. RDC1, for<br>
example, though earlier thought to be a receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), until<br>
recently has been considered to be an orphan receptor because its endogenous ligand has not<br>
been identified. See, e.g., Cook et al., FEBS Letts. 300(2): 149-152 (1992).<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[07] Recently, RDC1, renamed as CCX-CKR2, was determined to bind to<br>
both chemokines SDF-1 and I-TAC See, e.g., PCT/US04/34807 and U.S. Patent Application<br>
Nos. 10/698,541, 10/912,638 and 11/050,345 each of which are incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
[33] "RDC1," designated herein as "CCX-CKR2" refers to a seven-<br>
transmembrane domain presumed G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The CCX-CKR2 dog<br>
ortholog was originally identified in 1991. See, Libert et al. Science 244:569-572 (1989).<br>
The dog sequence is described in Libert et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 18(7): 1917(1990). The<br>
mouse sequence is described in, e.g., Heesen et al., Immunogenetics 47:364-370 (1998). The<br>
human sequence is described in, e.g., Sreedharan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:4986-<br>
4990 (1991), which mistakenly described the protein as a receptor of vasoactive intestinal<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
peptide. "CCX-CKR2" includes sequences that are conservatively modified variants of SEQ<br>
ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:8, or SEQ ID NO:10. Fragments of<br>
CCX-CKR2 are fragments of at least 5, and sometimes at least 10, 20, 50,100, 200, 300 or<br>
up to 300 contiguous amino acids of one of the above-listed sequences, or a conservatively<br>
modified variant thereof.<br>
[34] A "subject" or "individual" refers to an animal, including a human,<br>
non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog or other mammal.<br>
[35] A "chemotherapeutic agent" refers to an agent, which when<br>
administered to an individual is sufficient to cause inhibition, slowing or arresting of the<br>
growth of cancerous cells, or is sufficient to produce a cytotoxic effect in cancerous cells.<br>
Accordingly, the phrase "chemotherapeutically effective amount" describes an amount of a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent administered to an individual, which is sufficient to cause inhibition,<br>
slowing or arresting of the growth of cancerous cells, or which is sufficient to produce<br>
(directly or indirectly) a cytotoxic effect in cancerous cells. A "sub-therapeutic amount"<br>
refers to an amount less than is sufficient to cause inhibition, slowing or arresting of the<br>
growth of cancerous cells, or which is less than sufficient to produce a cytotoxic effect in<br>
cancerous cells.<br>
[36] "Antibody" refers to a polypeptide comprising a framework region<br>
from an immunoglobulin gene or fragments thereof that specifically binds and recognizes an<br>
antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma,<br>
delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable<br>
region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are<br>
classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin<br>
classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.<br>
[37] Naturally occurring immunoglobulins have a common core structure in<br>
which two identical light chains (about 24 kD) and two identical heavy chains (about 55 or 70<br>
kD) form a tetramer. The amino-terminal portion of each chain is known as the variable (V)<br>
region and can be distinguished from the more conserved constant (C) regions of the<br>
remainder of each chain. Within the variable region of the light chain is a C-terminal portion<br>
known as the J region. Within the variable region of the heavy chain, there is a D region in<br>
addition to the J region. Most of the amino acid sequence variation in immunogiobulins is<br>
confined to three separate locations in the V regions known as hypervariable regions or<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which are directly involved in antigen binding.<br>
Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these regions are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3,<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
respectively. The CDRs are held in place by more conserved framework regions (FRs).<br>
Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these regions are designated FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4,<br>
respectively. The locations of CDR and FR regions and a numbering system have been<br>
defined by, e.g., Kabat et al. (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,<br>
Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government Printing<br>
Office (1991)).<br>
[38] An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a<br>
tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair<br>
having one "light" (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The N-<br>
tenninus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids<br>
primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) and<br>
variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.<br>
[39] Antibodies exist, e.g., as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of<br>
well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for<br>
example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to<br>
produce F(ab)'2, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to VH-CHI by a disulfide<br>
bond. The F(ab)'2 may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the<br>
hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)'2 dimer into an Fab' monomer. The Fab' monomer<br>
is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region (see FUNDAMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY (Paul ed.,<br>
3d ed. 1993). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an<br>
intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo<br>
either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as<br>
used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole<br>
antibodies, or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g., single<br>
chain Fv) or those identified using phage display libraries (see, e.g., McCafferty et al, Nature<br>
348:552-554 (1990)).<br>
[40] For preparation of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, any technique<br>
known in the art can be used (see, e.g., Kohler &amp; Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975);<br>
Kozbor et al., Immunology Today 4:72 (1983); Cole et al., pp. 77-96 in Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies and Cancer Therapy (1985)). "Monoclonal" antibodies refer to antibodies derived<br>
from a single clone. Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,946,778) can be adapted to produce antibodies to polypeptides of this invention. Also,<br>
transgenic mice, or other organisms such as other mammals, may be used to express<br>
humanized antibodies. Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to identify<br>

antibodies and heteromeric Fab fragments that specifically bind to selected antigens (see, e.g.,<br>
McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554 (1990); Marks et al, Biotechnology 10:779-783<br>
(1992)).<br>
[41] A "chimeric antibody" is an antibody molecule in which (a) the<br>
constant region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged so that the antigen<br>
binding site (variable region) is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class,<br>
effector function and/or species, or an entirely different molecule which confers new<br>
properties to the chimeric antibody, e.g., an enzyme, toxin, hormone, growth factor, drug,<br>
etc.; or (b) the variable region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged with a<br>
variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity.<br>
[42] A "humanized" antibody is an antibody that retains the reactivity of a<br>
non-human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. This can be achieved, for<br>
instance, by retaining the non-human CDR regions and replacing the remaining parts of the<br>
antibody with their human counterparts. See, e.g., Morrison et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984); Morrison and Oi, Adv. Immunol., 44:65-92 (1988); Verhoeyen et<br>
al, Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988); Padlan, Molec. Immun., 28:489-498 (1991); Padlan,<br>
Molec. Immun., 31(3):169-217 (1994).<br>
[43] The term "isolated," when applied to a protein, denotes that the protein<br>
is essentially free of other cellular components with which it is associated in the natural state.<br>
It is preferably in a homogeneous state although it can be in either a dry or aqueous solution.<br>
Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such<br>
as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. A protein<br>
that is the predominant species present in a preparation is substantially purified. The term<br>
"purified" denotes that a protein gives rise to essentially one band in an electrophoretic gel.<br>
Particularly, it means that the protein is at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure,<br>
and most preferably at least 99% pure.<br>
[44] The phrase "specifically (or selectively) binds" to an antibody or<br>
"specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with," when referring to a protein or peptide,<br>
refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a<br>
heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologies. Thus, under designated<br>
immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two<br>
times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins<br>
present in the sample. Typically a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice<br>
background signal or noise and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background.<br>

WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[45] The terms "peptidomimetic" and "mimetic" refer to a synthetic<br>
chemical compound that has substantially the same structural and functional characteristics of<br>
a naturally or non-naturally occurring polypeptide (e.g., a reagent that binds to CCX-CKR2).<br>
Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with<br>
properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound<br>
are termed "peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics" (Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29<br>
(1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229<br>
(1987), which are incorporated herein by reference). Peptide mimetics that are structurally<br>
similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a<br>
paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity),<br>
such as found in a polypeptide of interest, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally<br>
replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of, e.g., -CH2NH-, -CH2S-, -CH2-<br>
CH2-, -CH=CH- (cis and trans), -COCH2-, -CH(OH)CH2-, and -CH2SO-. The mimetic can<br>
be either entirely composed of synthetic, non-natural analogues of amino acids, or, is a<br>
chimeric molecule of partly natural peptide amino acids and partly non-natural analogs of<br>
amino acids. The mimetic can also incorporate any amount of natural amino acid<br>
conservative substitutions as long as such substitutions also do not substantially alter the<br>
mimetic's structure and/or activity. For example, a mimetic composition is within the scope<br>
of the invention if it is capable of carrying out at least one of the binding or enzymatic<br>
activities of a polypeptide of interest.<br>
[46] A "ligand" refers to an agent, e.g., a polypeptide or other molecule,<br>
capable of binding to a receptor.<br>
[47] "Conservatively modified variants" applies to both amino acid and<br>
nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, "conservatively<br>
modified variants" refers to those nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical<br>
amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to<br>
essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a number of<br>
nucleic acid sequences will encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC,<br>
GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine<br>
is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons<br>
described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent<br>
variations," which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid<br>
sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG,<br>
which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only<br>
codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule.<br>
Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in<br>
each described sequence.<br>
[48] As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual<br>
substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein<br>
sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino<br>
acids in the encoded sequence is a "conservatively modified variant" where the alteration<br>
results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid.<br>
Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in<br>
the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude<br>
polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.<br>
[49] The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are<br>
conservative substitutions for one another:<br>
1)	Alanine (A), Glycine (G);<br>
2)	Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);<br>
3)	Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);<br>
4)	Arginine (R), Lysine (K);<br>
5)	Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);<br>
6)	Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);<br>
7)	Serine (S), Threonine (T); and<br>
8)	Cysteine (C), Methionine (M)<br>
(see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)).<br>
[50] "Percentage of sequence identity" is determined by comparing two<br>
optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the<br>
polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e.,<br>
gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions)<br>
for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the<br>
number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in<br>
both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched<br>
positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the<br>
result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[51] The terms "identical" or percent "identity," in the context of two or<br>
more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences<br>
that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are<br>
the same {i.e., 60% identity, optionally 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identity<br>
over a specified region, e.g., of the entire polypeptide sequences of the invention or the extra-<br>
cellular domains of the polypeptides of the invention), when compared and aligned for<br>
maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured<br>
using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and<br>
visual inspection. Such sequences are then said to be "substantially identical." This<br>
definition also refers to the complement of a test sequence. Optionally, the identity exists<br>
over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides in length, or more preferably over a region<br>
that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides in length. The present invention includes<br>
polypeptides that are substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID<br>
NO.16 and/or SEQ ID NO:18 and/or CDR1 or CDR2 within SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 16 and/or SEQ ID NO: 18, as displayed in Figure 1.<br>
[52] For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference<br>
sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison<br>
algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates<br>
are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated.<br>
Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The<br>
sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test<br>
sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.<br>
[53] A "comparison window", as used herein, includes reference to a<br>
segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting<br>
of, e.g., a full length sequence or from 20 to 600, about 50 to about 200, or about 100 to about<br>
150 amino acids or nucleotides in which a sequence may be compared to a reference<br>
sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally<br>
aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art.<br>
Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local<br>
homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by the<br>
homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by<br>
the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nat 7. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA,<br>
and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel<br>
et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement)).<br>
[54] An example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent<br>
sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which<br>
are described in Altschul et al. (1977) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al.<br>
(1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is<br>
publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information<br>
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring<br>
sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which<br>
either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of<br>
the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score<br>
threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for<br>
initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both<br>
directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased.<br>
Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward<br>
score for a pair of matching residues; always &gt; 0) and N (penalty score for mismatching<br>
residues; always 
cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the<br>
cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the<br>
cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-<br>
scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm<br>
parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN<br>
program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation<br>
(E) or 10, M=5, N=-4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the<br>
BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the<br>
BLOSUM62 scoring matrix {see Henikoff and Henikoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both<br>
strands.<br>
[55] The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the<br>
similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the<br>
smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a<br>
match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For<br>
example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than<br>
about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.<br>
[56] An indication that two nucleic acid sequences or polypeptides are<br>
substantially identical is that the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is<br>
immunologically cross reactive with the antibodies raised against the polypeptide encoded by<br>
the second nucleic acid, as described below. Thus, a polypeptide is typically substantially<br>
identical to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by<br>
conservative substitutions. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are<br>
substantially identical is that the two molecules or their complements hybridize to each other<br>
under stringent conditions, as described below. Yet another indication that two nucleic acid<br>
sequences are substantially identical is that the same primers can be used to amplify the<br>
sequence.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[57] Figure 1 depicts some embodiments of some of the complementarity<br>
determining regions (CDRs) of the antibodies of the invention (SEQ ID NOS: 19-22).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
/.	Antibodies of the invention<br>
[58] The present invention provides reagents and methods for treatment,<br>
diagnosis and prognosis for diseases and disorders related to CCX-CKR2 using antibodies<br>
against CCX-CKR2. Diseases and disorders related to CCX-CKR2 are exemplified more<br>
below and include, but are not limited to, cancer, diseases involving excessive or abnormal<br>
angiogenesis and arthritis.<br>
[59] In some embodiments, the antibodies are isolated. In some<br>
embodiments of the invention, the antibodies recognize the same epitope as the epitope<br>
bound by the CDRs in SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 14. In some embodiments of the<br>
invention, the antibodies recognize the same epitope as the epitope bound by the CDRs in<br>
SEQ ID NO:16 and SEQ ID NO:18. Antibodies comprising SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14, or SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 18, bind to CCX-CKR2 and compete with the<br>
chemokines SDF-1 and I-TAC for binding to CCX-CKR2. Competition assays for CCX-<br>
CKR2 binding are described in, e.g., See, e.g., PCT/US04/34807 and U.S. Patent Publication<br>
Nos. US2004/0170634 and 2005/0074826.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[60] In some embodiments of the invention, the antibodies bind to CCX-<br>
CKR2 but do not bind to human peripheral blood. For example, in some embodiments, the<br>
antibodies of the invention do not bind to at least one of the following: basophils, monocytes,<br>
plasmacytoid dendritic cells; B cells, or CD4+ T cells.<br>
[61] In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention comprise<br>
SEQ ID NO.12 or SEQ ID NO:14 or SEQ ID NO.16 or SEQ ID NO:18. In some<br>
embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention comprise SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14, or SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 18. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the<br>
present invention comprise the CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14 or SEQ ID NO: 16<br>
or SEQ ID NO: 18. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention comprise<br>
the CDRs of SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID NO:14, or SEQ ID NO:16 and SEQ ED NO.1S.<br>
[62] The locations of CDR and FR regions and a numbering system have<br>
been described previously, e.g., Kabat et al. (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S.<br>
Government Printing Office (1991)). CDRs can generally be identified using the NCBI<br>
IgBLAST algorithm. Those of skill in the art will recognize that different sequence<br>
algorithms can provide slightly different descriptions of the location of the CDRs in a<br>
particular antibody amino acid sequence. In some cases, the heavy chain CDRs occur at<br>
amino acid positions 31-35 (CDR1), 50-65 (CDR2) and 96-102 (CDR3). In some cases, the<br>
light chain CDRs occur at amino acid positions 24-34 (CDR1), 50-56 (CDR2) and 89-97<br>
(CDR3). In some embodiments, the CDRs are represented as depicted in Figure 1.<br>
[63] The ability of a particular antibody to recognize the same epitope as<br>
another antibody is typically determined by the ability of one antibody to competitively<br>
inhibit binding of the second antibody to the antigen, e.g., to CCX-CKR2 or a fragment or<br>
fusion thereof. Any of a number of competitive binding assays can be used to measure<br>
competition between two antibodies to the same antigen. An exemplary assay is a Biacore<br>
assay. Briefly in these assays, binding sites can be mapped in structural terms by testing the<br>
ability of interactants, e.g. different antibodies, to inhibit the binding of another. Injecting<br>
two consecutive antibody samples in sufficient concentration can identify pairs of competing<br>
antibodies for the same binding epitope. The antibody samples should have the potential to<br>
reach a significant saturation with each injection. The net binding of the second antibody<br>
injection is indicative for binding epitope analysis. Two response levels can be used to<br>
describe the boundaries of perfect competition versus non-competing binding due to distinct<br>
epitopes. The relative amount of binding response of the second antibody injection relative<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
to the binding of identical and distinct binding epitopes determines the degree of epitope<br>
overlap. Antibodies may recognize linear or conformational epitopes, hence antibodies may<br>
be competitive while recognizing dissimilar and distal epitopes.<br>
[64] Other conventional immunoassays known in the art can be used in the<br>
present invention. For example, antibodies can be differentiated by the epitope to which they<br>
bind using a sandwich ELISA assay. This is carried out by using a capture antibody to coat<br>
the surface of a well. A subsaturating concentration of tagged-antigen is then added to the<br>
capture surface. This protein will be bound to the antibody through a specific<br>
antibody:epitope interaction. After washing a second antibody, which has been covalently<br>
linked to a detectable moiety (e.g., HRP, with the labeled antibody being defined as the<br>
detection antibody) is added to the ELISA. If this antibody recognizes the same epitope as<br>
the capture antibody it will be unable to bind to the target protein as that particular epitope<br>
will no longer be available for binding. If however this second antibody recognizes a<br>
different epitope on the target protein it will be able to bind and this binding can be detected<br>
by quantifying the level of activity (and hence antibody bound) using a relevant substrate.<br>
The background is defined by using a single antibody as both capture and detection antibody,<br>
whereas the maximal signal can be established by capturing with an antigen specific antibody<br>
and detecting with an antibody to the tag on the antigen. By using the background and<br>
maximal signals as references, antibodies can be assessed in a pair-wise manner to determine<br>
epitope specificity.<br>
[65] A first antibody is considered to competitively inhibit binding of a<br>
second antibody, if binding of the second antibody to the antigen is reduced by at least 30%,<br>
usually at least about 40%, 50%, 60% or 75%, and often by at least about 90%, in the<br>
presence of the first antibody using any of the assays described above.<br>
[66] Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled<br>
artisan. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, e.g., by one or more injections of<br>
an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or<br>
adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal<br>
injections. The immunizing agent may include a protein encoded by a nucleic acid or<br>
fragment thereof or a fusion protein thereof. It may be useful to conjugate the immunizing<br>
agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of<br>
such immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum<br>
albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which<br>
may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM adjuvant<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
(monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization<br>
protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.<br>
[67] The antibodies may, alternatively, be monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described<br>
by Kohler &amp; Milstein, Nature 256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or<br>
other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit<br>
lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to<br>
the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. The<br>
immunizing agent will typically include a CCX-CKR2 polypeptide, or a fragment or fusion<br>
thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes ("PBLs") are used if cells of human<br>
origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian<br>
sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a<br>
suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding,<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (1986)). Immortalized cell lines<br>
are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and<br>
human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells<br>
can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit<br>
the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells<br>
lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the<br>
culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and<br>
thymidine ("HAT medium"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.<br>
[68] In some embodiments the antibodies of the invention are chimeric or<br>
humanized antibodies that compete with antibodies comprising SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14, or SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 18 for binding to CCX-CKR2. As noted above,<br>
humanized forms of antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins in which residues from a<br>
complementary determining region (CDR) of human antibody are replaced by residues from<br>
a CDR of a non-human species such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity,<br>
affinity and capacity. For example, the CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 14, or SEQ<br>
ID NO:16 and SEQ ID NO:18, can be inserted into the framework of a human antibody.<br>
[69] Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in<br>
the art, including phage display libraries (Hoogenboom &amp; Winter, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381<br>
(1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581 (1991)). The techniques of Cole et al. and<br>
Boerner et al. are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et<br>
al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner et al., J. Immunol.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
147(1): 86-95 (1991)). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing of human<br>
immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous<br>
immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge,<br>
human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all<br>
respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is<br>
described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425;<br>
5,661,016, and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al, Bio/Technology 10:779-<br>
783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368:812-13<br>
(1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnology 14:845-51 (1996); Neuberger, Nature<br>
Biotechnology 14:826 (1996); Lonberg &amp; Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93 (1995).<br>
[70] In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are single chain<br>
Fvs (scFvs). The VH and the VL regions (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ED NO: 14, or SEQ<br>
ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 18) of a scFv antibody comprise a single chain which is folded to<br>
create an antigen binding site similar to that found in two chain antibodies. Once folded,<br>
noncovalent interactions stabilize the single chain antibody. While the VH and VL regions of<br>
some antibody embodiments can be directly joined together, one of skill will appreciate that<br>
the regions may be separated by a peptide linker consisting of one or more amino acids.<br>
Peptide linkers and their use are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Huston et al., Proc. Nat'I<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 8:5879 (1988); Bird et al., Science 242:4236 (1988); Glockshuber et al.,<br>
Biochemistry 29:1362 (1990); U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778, U.S. Patent No. 5,132,405 and<br>
Stemmer et al.,Biotechniques 14:256-265 (1993). Generally the peptide linker will have no<br>
specific biological activity other than to join the regions or to preserve some minimum<br>
distance or other spatial relationship between the VH and VL. However, the constituent amino<br>
acids of the peptide linker may be selected to influence some property of the molecule such<br>
as the folding, net charge, or hydrophobicity. Single chain Fv (scFv) antibodies optionally<br>
include a peptide linker of no more than 50 amino acids, generally no more than 40 amino<br>
acids, preferably no more than 30 amino acids, and more preferably no more than 20 amino<br>
acids in length. In some embodiments, the peptide linker is a concatamer of the sequence<br>
Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser (SEQ ID NO:23), preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 such sequences. However,<br>
it is to be appreciated that some amino acid substitutions within the linker can be made. For<br>
example, a valine can be substituted for a glycine.<br>
[71] Methods of making scFv antibodies have been described. See,, Huse<br>
et al. Science 246:1275-1281 (1989); Ward et al, Nature 341:544-546 (1989); and Vaughan<br>
et al, Nature Biotech. 14:309-314 (1996). In brief, mRNA from B-cells from an immunized<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
animal is isolated and cDNA is prepared. The cDNA is amplified using primers specific for<br>
the variable regions of heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins. The PCR products are<br>
purified and the nucleic acid sequences are joined. If a linker peptide is desired, nucleic acid<br>
sequences that encode the peptide are inserted between the heavy and light chain nucleic acid<br>
sequences. The nucleic acid which encodes the scFv is inserted into a vector and expressed<br>
in the appropriate host cell. The scFv that specifically bind to the desired antigen are<br>
typically found by panning of a phage display library. Panning can be performed by any of<br>
several methods. Panning can conveniently be performed using cells expressing the desired<br>
antigen on their surface or using a solid surface coated with the desired antigen.<br>
Conveniently, the surface can be a magnetic bead. The unbound phage are washed off the<br>
solid surface and the bound phage are eluted.<br>
[72] Finding the antibody with the highest affinity is dictated by the<br>
efficiency of the selection process and depends on the number of clones that can be screened<br>
and the stringency with which it is done. Typically, higher stringency corresponds to more<br>
selective panning. If the conditions are too stringent, however, the phage will not bind. After<br>
one round of panning, the phage that bind to CCX-CKR2 coated plates or to cells expressing<br>
CCX-CKR2 on their surface are expanded in E. coli and subjected to another round of<br>
panning. In this way, an enrichment of many fold occurs in 3 rounds of panning. Thus, even<br>
when enrichment in each round is low, multiple rounds of panning will lead to the isolation<br>
of rare phage and the genetic material contained within which encodes the scFv with the<br>
highest affinity or one which is better expressed on phage.<br>
[73] Regardless of the method of panning chosen, the physical link between<br>
genotype and phenotype provided by phage display makes it possible to test every member of<br>
a cDNA library for binding to antigen, even with large libraries of clones.<br>
[74] In one embodiment, the antibodies are bispecific antibodies.<br>
Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, including, but not limited to, human or humanized,<br>
antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens or that have<br>
binding specificities for two epitopes on the same antigen. In one embodiment, one of the<br>
binding specificities is for a CCK-CKR2 protein, the other one is for another different cancer<br>
antigen. Alternatively, tetramer-type technology may create multivalent reagents.<br>
[75] In some embodiments, the antibody is conjugated to an effector<br>
moiety. The effector moiety can be any number of molecules, including detectable labeling<br>
moieties such as radioactive labels or fluorescent labels, or can be a therapeutic moiety.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[76] In other embodiments, the therapeutic moiety is a cytotoxic agent. In<br>
this method, targeting the cytotoxic agent to cancer tissue or cells, results in a reduction in the<br>
number of afflicted cells, thereby reducing symptoms associated with the cancer. Cytotoxic<br>
agents are numerous and varied and include, but are not limited to, cytotoxic drugs or toxins<br>
or active fragments of such toxins. Suitable toxins and their corresponding fragments include<br>
diphtheria A chain, exotoxin A chain, ricin A chain, abrin A chain, curcin, crotin,<br>
phenomycin, enomycin, auristatin and the like. Cytotoxic agents also include radiochemicals<br>
made by conjugating radioisotopes to antibodies of the invention.<br>
//. Immunoassays<br>
[77] The antibodies of the invention can be used to detect CCX-CKR2 or<br>
CCX-CKR2-expressing cells using any of a number of well recognized immunological<br>
binding assays (see, e.g., U.S. Patents 4,366,241; 4,376,110; 4,517,288; and 4,837,168). For<br>
a review of the general immunoassays, see also Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 37, Asai, ed.<br>
Academic Press, Inc. New York (1993); Basic and Clinical Immunology 7th Edition, Stites &amp;<br>
Terr, eds. (1991).<br>
[78] Thus, the present invention provides methods of detecting cells that<br>
express CCX-CKR2. In one method, a biopsy is performed on the subject and the collected<br>
tissue is tested in vitro. The tissue or cells from the tissue is then contacted, with an anti-<br>
CCX-CKR2 antibody of the invention. Any immune complexes which result indicate the<br>
presence of a CCX-CKR2 protein in the biopsied sample. To facilitate such detection, the<br>
antibody can be radiolabeled or coupled to an effector molecule which is a detectable label,<br>
such as a fluorescent label. In another method, the cells can be detected in vivo using<br>
imaging systems. Then, the localization of the label is determined. A conventional method<br>
for visualizing diagnostic imaging can be used. For example, paramagnetic isotopes can be<br>
used for MRI. Internalization of the antibody may be important to extend the life within the<br>
organism beyond that provided by extracellular binding, which will be susceptible to<br>
clearance by the extracellular enzymatic environment coupled with circulatory clearance.<br>
[79] CCX-CKR2 proteins can also be detected using standard immunoassay<br>
methods and the antibodies of the invention. Standard methods include, for example,<br>
radioimmunoassay, sandwich immunoassays (including ELISA), immunofluorescence<br>
assays, Western blot, affinity chromatography (affinity ligand bound to a solid phase), and in<br>
situ detection with labeled antibodies. A secondary detection agent may also be employed,<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
e.g., goat anti-mouse FITC. A general overview of the applicable technology can be found in<br>
Harlow &amp; Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (1988).<br>
[80] The present invention provides methods of detecting a cancer cell,<br>
including methods of providing a prognosis or diagnosis of cancer. CCX-CKR2 is expressed<br>
in nearly every cancer cell tested to date, whereas normal (non-cancer) expression of CCX-<br>
CKR2 appears to be limited to the kidney and some brain cells as well as in certain<br>
developmental stages of fetal liver. See, e.g., PCT/US04/34807 and U.S. Patent Application<br>
Nos. 10/698,541 and 10/912,638. Therefore, expression of CCX-CKR2 in a cell, and in<br>
particular, in a non-fetal cell and/or a ceil other than a kidney or brain cell, indicates the<br>
likely presence of a cancer cell. The presence of CCX CKR2 in the vascular endothelium of<br>
a tissue may also indicate the presence of a cancer. In some cases, samples containing CCX-<br>
CKR2-expressing cells are confirmed for the presence of cancer cells using other methods<br>
known in the art.<br>
[81] According to yet another aspect of the invention, methods for selecting<br>
a course of treatment of a subject having or suspected of having cancer are provided. The<br>
methods include obtaining from the subject a biological sample, contacting the sample with<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind specifically to CCX-CKR2,<br>
detecting the presence or absence of antibody binding, and selecting a course of treatment<br>
appropriate to the cancer of the subject. In some embodiments, the treatment is administering<br>
CCX-CKR2 antibodies of the invention to the subject.<br>
[82] The present invention provides for methods of diagnosing human<br>
diseases including, but not limited to cancer, e.g., carcinomas, gliomas, mesotheliomas,<br>
melanomas, lymphomas, leukemias, adenocarcinomas, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical<br>
cancer, glioblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and Burkitt's lymphoma, head<br>
and neck cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung<br>
cancer, cancer of the esophagus, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatobiliary cancer,<br>
cancer of the gallbladder, cancer of the small intestine, rectal cancer, kidney cancer, bladder<br>
cancer, prostate cancer, penile cancer, urethral cancer, testicular cancer, cervical cancer,<br>
vaginal cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, adrenal<br>
cancer, pancreatic endocrine cancer, carcinoid cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer,<br>
retinoblastomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (see, CANCER.PRINCIPLES<br>
AND PRACTICE (DeVita, V.T. et al. eds 1997) for additional cancers); as well as brain and<br>
neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis; kidney dysfunction;<br>
rheumatoid arthritis; cardiac allograft rejection; atherosclerosis; asthma; glomerulonephritis;<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
contact dermatitis; inflammatory bowel disease; colitis; psoriasis; reperfusion injury; as well<br>
as other disorders and diseases described herein. In some embodiments, the subject does not<br>
have Kaposi's sarcoma, multicentric Castleman's disease or AIDS-associated primary<br>
effusion lymphoma.<br>
///. Modulators of CCX-CKR2<br>
A. Methods of Identifying Modulators of Chemokine Receptors<br>
[83] A number of different screening protocols can be utilized to identify<br>
agents that modulate the level of activity or function of CCX-CKR2 in cells, particularly in<br>
mammalian cells, and especially in human cells. In general terms, the screening methods<br>
involve screening a plurality of agents to identify an agent that interacts with CCX-CKR2 (or<br>
an extracellular domain thereof), for example, by binding to CCX-CKR2 and preventing<br>
antibodies of the invention from binding to CCX-CKR2 or activating CCX-CKR2. In some<br>
embodiments, an agent binds CCX-CKR2 with at least about 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100,<br>
300, 500, or 1000 times the affinity of the agent for another protein.<br>
1. Chemokine Receptor Binding Assays<br>
[84] In some embodiments, CCX-CKR2 modulators are identified by<br>
screening for molecules that compete with antibody of the invention from binding to a CCX-<br>
CKR2 polypeptide. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are a number of ways to<br>
perform competition analyses. In some embodiments, samples with CCX-CKR2 are pre-<br>
incubated with a labeled antibody of the invention (e.g., an antibody comprising at least the<br>
CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 16 and/or SEQ ID NO: 18) and then<br>
contacted with a potential competitor molecule. Alteration (e.g., a decrease) of the quantity<br>
of antibody bound to CCX-CKR2 in the presence of a test compound indicates that the test<br>
compound is a potential CCX-CKR2 modulator.<br>
[85] Preliminary screens can be conducted by screening for agents capable<br>
of binding to a CCX-CKR2, as at least some of the agents so identified are likely chemokine<br>
receptor modulators. The binding assays usually involve contacting CCX-CKR2 with one or<br>
more test agents and allowing sufficient time for the protein and test agents to form a binding<br>
complex. Any binding complexes formed can be detected using any of a number of<br>
established analytical techniques. Protein binding assays include, but are not limited to,<br>
immunohistochemical binding assays, flow cytometry, radioligand binding, europium labeled<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
ligand binding, biotin labeled ligand binding or other assays which maintain the conformation<br>
of CCX-CKR2. The chemokine receptor utilized in such assays can be naturally expressed,<br>
cloned or synthesized. Binding assays may be used to identify agonists or antagonists. For<br>
example, by contacting CCX-CKR2 with a potential agonist and measuring for CCX-CKR2<br>
activity, it is possible to identify those molecules that stimulate CCX-CKR2 activity.<br>
2. Cells and Reagents<br>
[86] The screening methods of the invention can be performed as in vitro or<br>
cell-based assays. In vitro assays are performed for example, using membrane fractions or<br>
whole cells comprising CCX-CKR2. Cell based assays can be performed in any cells in<br>
which CCX-CKR2 is expressed.<br>
[87] Cell-based assays involve whole cells or cell fractions containing<br>
CCX-CKR2 to screen for agent binding or modulation of activity of CCX-CKR2 by the<br>
agent. Exemplary cell types that can be used according to the methods of the invention<br>
include, e.g., any mammalian cells including leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes,<br>
macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, such as T cells and B<br>
cells, ieukemias, Burkitt's lymphomas, tumor cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts,<br>
cardiac cells, muscle cells, breast tumor cells, ovarian cancer carcinomas, cervical<br>
carcinomas, glioblastomas, liver cells, kidney cells, and neuronal cells, as well as fungal<br>
cells, including yeast. Cells can be primary cells or tumor cells or other types of immortal<br>
cell lines. Of course, CCX-CKR2 can be expressed in cells that do not express an<br>
endogenous version of CCX-CKR2.<br>
[88] In some cases, fragments of CCX-CKR2, as well as protein fusions,<br>
can be used for screening. When molecules that compete for binding with CCX-CKR2<br>
ligands are desired, the CCX-CKR2 fragments used are fragments capable of binding the<br>
antibodies of the invention. Alternatively, any fragment of CCX-CKR2 can be used as a<br>
target to identify molecules that bind CCX-CKR2. CCX-CKR2 fragments can include any<br>
fragment of, e.g., at least 20, 30, 40, 50 amino acids up to a protein containing all but one<br>
amino acid of CCX-CKR2. Typically, ligand-binding fragments will comprise<br>
transmembrane regions and/or most or all of the extracellular domains of CCX-CKR2.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
3. Signaling or adhesion activity<br>
[89] In some embodiments, signaling triggered by CCX-CKR2 activation is<br>
used to identify CCX-CKR2 modulators. Signaling activity of chemokine receptors can be<br>
determined in many ways. For example, signaling can be determined by detecting<br>
chemokine receptor-mediated cell adhesion. Interactions between chemokines and<br>
chemokine receptors can lead to rapid adhesion through the modification of integrin affinity<br>
and avidity. See, e.g., Laudanna, Immunological Reviews 186:37-46 (2002).<br>
[90] Signaling can also be measured by determining, qualitatively and<br>
quantitatively, secondary messengers, such as cyclic AMP or inositol phosphates, as well as<br>
phosphorylarion or dephosphorylation events can also be monitored. See, e.g., Premack, et<br>
al. Nature Medicine 2: 1174-1178 (1996) and Bokoch, Blood 86:1649-1660 (1995).<br>
[91] In addition, other events downstream of CCX-CKK2 activation can<br>
also be monitored to determine signaling activity. Downstream events include those<br>
activities or manifestations that occur as a result of stimulation of a chemokine receptor.<br>
Exemplary downstream events include, e.g., changed state of a cell (e.g., from normal to<br>
cancer cell or from cancer cell to non-cancerous cell). Cell responses include adhesion of<br>
cells (e.g., to endothelial cells). Established signaling cascades involved in angiogenesis<br>
(e.g., VEGF-mediated signaling) can also be monitored for effects caused by CCX-CKR2<br>
modulators. The ability of agents to promote angiogenesis can be evaluated, for example, in<br>
chick chorioallantoic membrane, as discussed by Leung et al. (1989) Science 246:1306-1309.<br>
Another option is to conduct assays with rat corneas, as discussed by Rastinejad et al. (1989)<br>
Cell 56:345-355. Other assays are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,840,693. Ovarian<br>
angiogenesis models can also be used (see, e.g., Zimmerman, R.C., et al. (2003) J. Clin.<br>
Invest. 112:659-669; Zimmerman, R.C., et al. (2001) Microvasc. Res. 62:15-25; and<br>
Hixenbaugh, E.A., et al. (1993) Anat. Rec. 235: 487-500).<br>
[92] Other screening methods are based on the observation that expression<br>
of certain regulatory proteins is induced by the presence or activation of CCX-CKR2.<br>
Detection of such proteins can thus be used to indirectly determine the activity of CCX-<br>
CKR2. A series of ELISA investigations were conducted to compare the relative<br>
concentration of various secreted proteins in the cell culture media for cells transfected with<br>
CCX-CKR2 and untransfected cells. Through these studies it was determined that CCX-<br>
CKR2 induces the production of a number of diverse regulatory proteins, including growth<br>
factors, chemokines, metalloproteinases and inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Thus, some of<br>
the screening methods that are provided involve determining whether a test agent modulates<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
the production of certain growth factors, chemokines, metalloproteinases and inhibitors of<br>
metalloproteinases by CCX-CKR2. In some instances, the assays are conducted with cells<br>
(or extracts thereof) that have been grown under limiting serum conditions as this was found<br>
to increase the production of the CCX-CKR2-induced proteins.<br>
{93] The following proteins are examples of the various classes of proteins<br>
that were detected, as well as specific proteins within each class: (1) growth factors (e.g.,<br>
GM-CSF); (2) chemokines (e.g., RANTES, MCP-1); (3) cytokines (eg IL-6) (4)<br>
metalloproteinase (e.g., MMP3); and (5) inhibitor of metalloproteinase (e.g., TIMP-1). It is<br>
expected that other proteins in these various classes can also be detected.<br>
[94] These particular proteins can be detected using standard<br>
immunological detection methods that are known in the art. One approach that is suitable for<br>
use in a high-throughput format, for example, are ELISAs that are conducted in multi-well<br>
plates. An ELISA kit for detecting TEMP-1 is available from DakoCytomation (Product<br>
Code No. EL513). ELISA kits for IL-6 and MMP3 can be obtained from R and D Systems.<br>
Further examples of suppliers of antibodies that specifically bind the proteins listed above are<br>
provided in the examples below. Proteins such as the metalloproteinases that are enzymes<br>
can also be detected by known enzymatic assays.<br>
[95] In other embodiments, potential modulators of CCX-CK2 are tested for<br>
their ability to modulate cell adhesion. Tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers<br>
has been studied as a model of metastatic invasion (see, e.g., Blood and Zetter, Biovhem .<br>
Biophys. Acta, 1032, 89-119 (1990). These monolayers of endotheh'al cells mimic the<br>
lymphatic vasculature and can be stimulated with various cytokines and growth factors (e.g.,<br>
TNFalpha and IL-lbeta). Cells expressing CCX-CKR2 can be evaluated for the ability to<br>
adhere to this monolayer in both static adhesion assays as well as assays where cells are<br>
under flow conditions to mimic the force of the vasculature in vivo. Additionally, assays to<br>
evaluate adhesion can also be performed in vivo (see, e.g., von Andrian, U.H.<br>
Microdrculation. 3(3):287-300 (1996)).<br>
4. Validation<br>
[96] Agents that are initially identified by any of the foregoing screening<br>
methods can be further tested to validate the apparent activity. Preferably such studies are<br>
conducted with suitable animal models. The basic format of such methods involves<br>
administering a lead compound identified during an initial screen to an animal that serves as a<br>
disease model for humans and then determining if the disease (e.g., cancer, myocardial<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
infarction, wound healing, or other diseases related to angiogenesis) is in fact modulated<br>
and/or the disease or condition is ameliorated. The animal models utilized in validation<br>
studies generally are mammals of any kind. Specific examples of suitable animals include,<br>
but are not limited to, primates, mice, rats and zebrafish.<br>
[97] In some embodiments, arthritis animal models are used to screen<br>
and/or validate therapeutic uses for agents that modulate CCX-CKR2. Exemplary arthritis<br>
animal models include, e.g., the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) animal model.<br>
B. Agents that interact with CCX-CKR2<br>
[98] Modulators of CCX-CKR2 (e.g., antagonists or agonists) can include,<br>
e.g., antibodies (including monoclonal, humanized or other types of binding proteins that are<br>
known in the art), small organic molecules, siRNAs, CCX-CKR2 polypeptides or variants<br>
thereof, chemokines (including but not limited to SDF-1 and/or I-TAC), chemokine<br>
mimetics, chemokine polypeptides, etc.<br>
[99] The agents tested as modulators of CCX-CKR2 can be any small<br>
chemical compound, or a biological entity, such as a polypeptide, sugar, nucleic acid or lipid.<br>
Alternatively, modulators can be genetically altered versions, or peptidomimetic versions, of<br>
a chemokine or other ligand. Typically, test compounds will be small chemical molecules<br>
and peptides. Essentially any chemical compound can be used as a potential modulator or<br>
ligand in the assays of the invention, although most often compounds that can be dissolved in<br>
aqueous or organic (especially DMSO-based) solutions are used. The assays are designed to<br>
screen large chemical libraries by automating the assay steps and providing compounds from<br>
any convenient source to assays, which are typically run in parallel (e.g., in microtiter formats<br>
on microtiter plates in robotic assays). It will be appreciated that there are many suppliers of<br>
chemical compounds, including Sigma (St. Louis, MO), Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Sigma-<br>
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Fluka Chemika-Biochemica Analytika (Buchs, Switzerland) and the<br>
like.<br>
[100] In some embodiments, the agents have a molecular weight of less than<br>
1,500 daltons, and in some cases less than 1,000, 800, 600, 500, or 400 daltons. The<br>
relatively small size of the agents can be desirable because smaller molecules have a higher<br>
likelihood of having physiochemical properties compatible with good pharmacokinetic<br>
characteristics, including oral absorption than agents with higher molecular weight. For<br>
example, agents less likely to be successful as drugs based on permeability and solubility<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
were described by Lipinski et al. as follows: having more than 5 H-bond donors (expressed as<br>
the sum of OHs and NHs); having a molecular weight over 500; having a LogP over 5 (or<br>
MLogP over 4.15); and/or having more than 10 H-bond acceptors (expressed as the sum of<br>
Ns and Os). See, e.g., Lipinski et al. Adv Drug Delivery Res 23:3-25 (1997). Compound<br>
classes that are substrates for biological transporters are typically exceptions to the rule.<br>
[101] In one embodiment, high throughput screening methods involve<br>
providing a combinatorial chemical or peptide library containing a large number of potential<br>
therapeutic compounds (potential modulator or ligand compounds). Such "combinatorial<br>
chemical libraries" or "ligand libraries" are then screened in one or more assays, as described<br>
herein, to identify those library members (particular chemical species or subclasses) that<br>
display a desired characteristic activity. The compounds thus identified can serve as<br>
conventional "lead compounds" or can themselves be used as potential or actual therapeutics.<br>
[102] A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical<br>
compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, by combining a<br>
number of chemical "building blocks." For example, a linear combinatorial chemical library<br>
such as a polypeptide library is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks<br>
(amino acids) in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino<br>
acids in a polypeptide compound). Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized<br>
through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks.<br>
[103] Preparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries is well<br>
known to those of skill in the art. Such combinatorial chemical libraries include, but are not<br>
limited to, peptide libraries (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,010,175, Furka, Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res.<br>
37:487-493 (1991) and Houghton et al., Nature 354:84-88 (1991)). Other chemistries for<br>
generating chemical diversity libraries can also be used. Such chemistries include, but are<br>
not limited to: peptoids (e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 91/19735), encoded peptides (e.g.,<br>
PCT Publication WO 93/20242), random bio-oligomers (e.g., PCT Publication No. WO<br>
92/00091), benzodiazepines (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), diversomers such as hydantoins,<br>
benzodiazepines and dipeptides (Hobbs et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6909-6913<br>
(1993)), vinylogous polypeptides (Hagihara et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114:6568 (1992)),<br>
nonpeptidal peptidomimetics with glucose scaffolding (Hirschmann et al, J. Amer. Chem.<br>
Soc. 114:9217-9218 (1992)), analogous organic syntheses of small compound libraries (Chen<br>
et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 116:2661 (1994)), oligocarbamates (Cho et al, Science 261:1303<br>
(1993)), and/or peptidyl phosphonates (Campbell etal.,J. Org. Chem. 59:658 (1994)),<br>

IV. Cancer, angiogenesis and other biological aspects of CCX-CKR2<br>
[105] The antibodies of the invention can be contacted to a cell expressing<br>
CCX-CKR2 in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo (i.e., removed from a body, treated and returned to<br>
the body). The antibodies of the invention can be administered directly to the mammalian<br>
subject for modulation of chemokine receptor activity in vivo. In some embodiments, the<br>
antibodies compete with SDF1 and/or I-TAC for binding to CCX-CKR2. In some<br>
embodiments of the invention, the antibodies recognize the same epitope as the epitope<br>
bound by the CDRs in SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID NO:14, or SEQ ID NO:16 and SEQ ID<br>
NO: 18. In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise SEQ ID NO: 12 and/or SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14, or SEQ ID NO: 16 and/or SEQ ID NO: 18.<br>
[106] In some embodiments, the CCX-CKR2 antibodies are administered to<br>
a subject having cancer. In some cases, CCX-CKR2 modulators are administered to treat<br>
cancer, e.g., carcinomas, gliomas, mesotheliomas, melanomas, lymphomas, leukemias,<br>
adenocarcinomas, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, glioblastoma, leukemia,<br>
lymphoma, prostate cancer, and Burkitt's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, colon cancer,<br>
colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of the esophagus,<br>
stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, cancer of the gallbladder, cancer of<br>
the small intestine, rectal cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, penile<br>
cancer, urethral cancer, testicular cancer, cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, uterine cancer,<br>
ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, adrenal cancer, pancreatic endocrine<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
cancer, carcinoid cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, retinoblastomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma,<br>
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (see, CANCER:PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (DeVita, V.T. et al. eds<br>
1997) for additional cancers); as well as brain and neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's<br>
disease and multiple sclerosis; kidney dysfunction; rheumatoid arthritis; cardiac allograft<br>
rejection; atherosclerosis; asthma; glomerulonephritis; contact dermatitis; inflammatory<br>
bowel disease; colitis; psoriasis; reperfusion injury; as well as other disorders and diseases<br>
described herein. In some embodiments, the subject does not have Kaposi's sarcoma,<br>
multicentric Castleman's disease or AEDS-associated primary effusion lymphoma.<br>
[107] The present invention also encompasses decreasing angiogenesis in<br>
any subject in need thereof by administering antibodies of the invention. For example,<br>
decreasing CCX-CKR2 activity by contacting CCX-CKR2 with an antibody of the invention,<br>
thereby decreasing angiogenesis, is useful to inhibit formation, growth and/or metastasis of<br>
tumors, especially solid tumors. Description of embodiments relating to modulated CCX-<br>
CKR2 and angiogenesis are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 11/050,345.<br>
[108] Other disorders involving unwanted or problematic angiogenesis<br>
include rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis; ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic<br>
retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, comeal graft rejection,<br>
neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis; Osier-Webber Syndrome; myocardial<br>
angiogenesis; plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma;<br>
disease of excessive or abnormal stimulation of endothelial cells, including intestinal<br>
adhesions, Crohn's disease, skin diseases such as psoriasis, excema, and scleroderma,<br>
diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration,<br>
atherosclerosis, scleroderma, wound granulation and hypertrophic scars, i.e., keloids, and<br>
diseases that have angiogenesis as a pathologic consequence such as cat scratch disease and<br>
ulcers (Helicobacter pylori), can also be treated with antibodies of the invention. Angiogenic<br>
inhibitors can be used to prevent or inhibit adhesions, especially intra-peritoneal or pelvic<br>
adhesions such as those resulting after open or laproscopic surgery, and bum contractions.<br>
Other conditions which should be beneficially treated using the angiogenesis inhibitors<br>
include prevention of scarring following transplantation, cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary<br>
fibrosis following acute respiratory distress syndrome or other pulmonary fibrosis of the<br>
newborn, implantation of temporary prosthetics, and adhesions after surgery between the<br>
brain and the dura. Endometriosis, polyposis, cardiac hypertrophyy, as well as obesity, may<br>
also be treated by inhibition of angiogenesis. These disorders may involve increases in size<br>
or growth of other types of normal tissue, such as uterine fibroids, prostatic hypertrophy, and<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
amyloidosis. Antibodies of the present invention maybe used prophylactically or<br>
therapeutically for any of the disorders or diseases described herein.<br>
[109] Decreasing CCX-CKR2 activity with the antibodies of the present<br>
invention can also be used in the prevention of neovascularization to effectively treat a host<br>
of disorders. Thus, for example, the decreasing angiogenesis can be used as part of a<br>
treatment for disorders of blood vessels (e.g., hemangiomas and capillary proliferation within<br>
atherosclerotic plaques), muscle diseases (e.g., myocardial angiogenesis, myocardial<br>
infarction or angiogenesis within smooth muscles), joints (e.g., arthritis, hemophiliac joints,<br>
etc.), and other disorders associated with angiogenesis. Promotion of angiogenesis can also<br>
aid in accelerating various physiological processes and treatment of diseases requiring<br>
increased vascularization such as the healing of wounds, fractures, and bums, inflammatory<br>
diseases, ischeric heart, and peripheral vascular diseases.<br>
[110] The antibodies of the present invention may also be used to enhance<br>
wound healing. Without intending to limit the invention to a particular mechanism of action,<br>
it may be that antagonism of CCX-CKR2 allows for endogenous ligands to instead bind to<br>
lower affinity receptors, thereby triggering enhanced wound healing. For example, SDF-1<br>
binds to both CCX-CKR2 and CXCR4, but binds to CXCR4 with a lower affinity. Similarly,<br>
I-TAC binds to CXCR3 with a lower affinity than I-TAC binds to CCX-CKR2. By<br>
preventing binding of these ligands to CCX-CKR2, CCX-CKR2 antagonists may allow the<br>
ligands to bind to the other receptors, thereby enhancing wound healing. Thus, the<br>
antagonism of CCX-CKR2 to enhance wound healing may be mediated by a different<br>
mechanism than enhancing wound healing by stimulating CCX-CKR2 activity with an<br>
agonist.<br>
[111] Aside from treating disorders and symptoms associated with<br>
neovascularization, the inhibition of angiogenesis can be used to modulate or prevent the<br>
occurrence of normal physiological conditions associated with neovascularization. Thus, for<br>
example the inventive method can be used as a birth control. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, decreasing CCX-CKR2 activity within the ovaries or endometrium can attenuate<br>
neovascularization associated with ovulation, implantation of an embryo, placenta formation,<br>
etc.<br>
[112] Inhibitors of angiogenesis have yet other therapeutic uses. For<br>
example, the antibodies of the present invention maybe used for the following:<br>
(a) Adipose tissue ablation and treatment of obesity. See, e.g. Kolonin et al.,<br>
Nature Medicine 10(6):625-632 (2004);<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
(b)	Treatment of preclampsia. See, e.g., Levine et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 350(7):<br>
672-683 (2004); Maynard, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 111(5): 649-658 (2003); and<br>
(c)	Treatment of cardiovascular disease. See, e.g., March, et al., Am. J. Physiol.<br>
Heart Circ. Physiol. 287:H458-H463 (2004); Rehman etal, Circulation 109: 1292-1298<br>
(2004).<br>
V.	Administration and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
[113] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise, e.g.,<br>
an antibody of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition<br>
being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition.<br>
Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of the present invention (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed. 1985)).<br>
[114] Formulations suitable for administration include aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous solutions, isotonic sterile solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers,<br>
bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic, and aqueous and non-aqueous<br>
sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents,<br>
stabilizers, and preservatives. In the practice of this invention, compositions can be<br>
administered, for example, orally, nasally, topically, intravenously, intraperitoneally,<br>
subcutaneously, or intrathecally. The formulations of compounds can be presented in unit-<br>
dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials. Solutions and suspensions<br>
can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
[115] The composition can be administered by means of an infusion pump,<br>
for example, of the type used for delivering insulin or chemotherapy to specific organs or<br>
tumors. Compositions of the inventions can be injected using a syringe or catheter directly<br>
into a tumor or at the site of a primary tumor prior to or after excision; or systemically<br>
following excision of the primary tumor. The compositions of the invention can be<br>
administered topically or locally as needed. For prolonged local administration, the<br>
antibodies may be administered in a controlled release implant injected at the site of a tumor.<br>
Alternatively an individual's cells can be transfected ex vivo with plasmids so as to express<br>
the antibody of the invention and subsequently injected at the site of the tumor. For topical<br>
treatment of a skin condition, the enzyme antibodies may be administered to the skin in an<br>
ointment or gel.<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[116] In some embodiments, CCX-CKR2 antibodies of the present invention<br>
can be administered in combination with other appropriate therapeutic agents, including, e.g.,<br>
chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, etc. Selection of the appropriate agents for use in<br>
combination therapy may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art, according to<br>
conventional pharmaceutical principles. The combination of therapeutic agents may act<br>
synergistically to effect the treatment or prevention of the various disorders such as, e.g.,<br>
cancer, wounds, kidney dysfunction, brain dysfunction or neuronal dysfunction. Using this<br>
approach, one may be able to achieve therapeutic efficacy with lower dosages of each agent,<br>
thus reducing the potential for adverse side effects.<br>
[117] The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present<br>
invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial response in the subject over time (e.g., to<br>
reduce rumor size or tumor load). The optimal dose level for any patient will depend on a<br>
variety of factors including the efficacy of the specific modulator employed, the age, body<br>
weight, physical activity, and diet of the patient, on a possible combination with other drugs,<br>
and on the severity of a particular disease. The size of the dose also will be determined by<br>
the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the<br>
administration of a particular compound or vector in a particular subject.<br>
[118] In determining the effective amount of the antibody to be administered<br>
a physician may evaluate circulating plasma levels of the antibody, antibody toxicity, and the<br>
production of anti-antibody antibodies, in general, the dose equivalent of an antibody is from<br>
about 1 ng/kg to 10 mg/kg for a typical subject.<br>
[119] For administration, the antibodies of the present invention can be<br>
administered at a rate determined by the LD-50 of the antibody, and the side-effects of the<br>
antibody at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject.<br>
Clearance of the antibody by the recipient's immune system may also affect the suitable<br>
dosage to be administered. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.<br>
[120] The compositions containing antibodies of the invention can be<br>
administered for therapeutic or prophylactic treatments. In therapeutic applications,<br>
compositions are administered to a patient suffering from a disease (e.g., a cancer, arthritis or<br>
other CCX-CKR2-related disease or disorder) in an amount sufficient to cure or at least<br>
partially arrest the disease and its complications, e.g., decreased size of tumor, etc. An<br>
amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a "therapeutically effective dose." Amounts<br>
effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the<br>
patient's health. Single or multiple administrations of the compositions may be administered<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. In any event,<br>
the composition should provide a sufficient quantity of the agents of this invention to<br>
effectively treat the patient. An amount of modulator that is capable of preventing or slowing<br>
the development of cancer in a mammal is referred to as a "prophylactically effective dose."<br>
The particular dose required for a prophylactic treatment will depend upon the medical<br>
condition and history of the mammal, the particular cancer being prevented, as well as other<br>
factors such as age, weight, gender, administration route, efficiency, etc. Such prophylactic<br>
treatments may be used, e.g., in a mammal who has previously had cancer to prevent a<br>
recurrence of the cancer, or in a mammal who is suspected of having a significant likelihood<br>
of developing cancer.<br>
VI.	Combination therapies<br>
[121] Antibodies of the invention can be supplied alone or in conjunction<br>
with one or more other drugs. Possible combination partners can include, e.g., additional<br>
anti-angiogenic factors and/or chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cytotoxic agents) or radiation, a<br>
cancer vaccine, an immunornodulatory agent, an anti-vascular agent, a signal transduction<br>
inhibitor, an antiproliferative agent, or an apoptosis inducer.<br>
[122] Antibodies of the invention can be used in conjunction with antibodies<br>
and peptides that block integrin engagement, proteins and small molecules that inhibit<br>
metalloproteinases (e.g., marmistat), agents that block phosphorylation cascades within<br>
endothelial cells (e.g., herbamycin), dominant negative receptors for known inducers of<br>
angiogenesis, antibodies against inducers of angiogenesis or other compounds that block their<br>
activity (e.g., suramin), or other compounds (e.g., retinoids, IL-4, interferons, etc.) acting by<br>
other means. Indeed, as such factors may modulate angiogenesis by different mechanisms,<br>
employing antibodies of the invention in combination with other antiangiogenic agents can<br>
potentiate a more potent (and potentially synergistic) inhibition of angiogenesis within the<br>
desired tissue.<br>
[123] Anti-angiogenesis agents, such as MMP-2 (matrix-metalloprotienase<br>
2) inhibitors, MMP-9 (matrix-metalloprotienase 9) inhibitors, and COX-II (cyclooxygenase<br>
fl) inhibitors, can be used in conjunction with antibodies of the invention and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions described herein. Anti-CCX-CKR2 antibodies of the invention can also be<br>
used with signal transduction inhibitors, such as agents that can inhibit EGFR (epidermal<br>
growth factor receptor) responses, such as EGFR antibodies, EGF antibodies, and molecules<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
that are EGFR inhibitors; VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors, such as<br>
VEGF receptors and molecules that can inhibit VEGF; and erbB2 receptor inhibitors, such as<br>
organic molecules or antibodies that bind to the erbB2 receptor, for example, HERCEPTIN™<br>
(Genentech, Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif., USA).<br>
[124] Anti-CCX-CKR2 antibodies of the invention can also be combined<br>
with other drugs including drugs that promote angiogenesis and/or wound healing. Those of<br>
skill in the art will appreciate that one can incorporate one or more medico-surgically useful<br>
substances or therapeutic agents, e.g., those which can further intensify the angiogenic<br>
response, and/or accelerate and/or beneficially modify the healing process when the<br>
composition is applied to the desired site requiring angiogenesis. For example, to further<br>
promote angiogenesis, repair and/or tissue growth, at least one of several hormones, growth<br>
factors or mitogenic proteins can be included in the composition, e.g., fibroblast growth<br>
factor, platelet derived growth factor, macrophage derived growth factor, etc. In addition,<br>
antimicrobial agents can be included in the compositions, e.g., antibiotics such as gentamicin<br>
sulfate, or erythromycin. Other medico-surgically useful agents can include anti-<br>
inflammatories, analgesics, anesthetics, rubifacients, enzymes, antihistamines and dyes.<br>
[125] Anti-CCX-CKR2 antibodies of the invention can also be combined<br>
with other drugs including drugs for treating arthritis. Examples of such agents include anti-<br>
inflammatory therapeutic agents. For example, glucocorticosteroids, such as prednisolone<br>
and methylprednisolone, are often-used anti-inflammatory drugs. Nonsteroidal anti-<br>
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also used to suppress inflammation. NSAIDs-inhibit the<br>
cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which are central to the production of<br>
prostaglandins produced in excess at sites of inflammation. In addition, the inflammation-<br>
promoting cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), is associated with multiple<br>
inflammatory events, including arthritis, and anti-TNFα therapies are being used clinically.<br>
VII. Kits for use in diagnostic and/or prognostic applications<br>
[126] For use in diagnostic, research, and therapeutic applications suggested<br>
above, kits are also provided by the invention. In the diagnostic and research applications<br>
such kits may include any or all of the following: assay reagents, buffers, and the anti-CCX-<br>
CKR2 antibodies of the invention. A therapeutic product may include sterile saline or<br>
another pharmaceutically acceptable emulsion and suspension base.<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
[127] In addition, the kits may include instructional materials containing<br>
directions (i.e., protocols) for the practice of the methods of this invention. While the<br>
instructional materials typically comprise written or printed materials they are not limited to<br>
such. Any medium capable of storing such instructions and communicating them to an end<br>
user is contemplated by this invention. Such media include, but are not limited to electronic<br>
storage media (e.g., magnetic discs, tapes, cartridges, chips), optical media (e.g., CD ROM),<br>
and the like. Such media may include addresses to internet sites that provide such<br>
instructional materials.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[128] Production of antibodies to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) has<br>
been notoriously difficult. We used the method of Genovac AG, DE outlined in Canadian<br>
Patent application CA 2 350 078. Antibodies that bind CCX-CKR2 were created by<br>
inoculation of mice with cDNA expressing CCX-CKR2 (SEQ ID NO:1). Briefly, CCX-<br>
CKR2 was cloned into an expression vector and mice were inoculated with the vector by the<br>
gene gun method. At an appropriate time point, B cells were isolated, fused with myeloma<br>
cells by standard techniques, and fused hybridoma cells selected in in vitro culture.<br>
Supernatants from clonal cultures were analyzed for binding to cells stably transfected with<br>
CCX-CKR2 by flow cytometry. Positive clones were amplified and subjected to further<br>
rounds of flow cytometric screening.<br>
[129] It was determined that monoclonal antibodies 6E10 and 11G8 bind to<br>
CCX-CKR2. Antibodies 6E10 and 11G8 detected CCX-CKR2 on transfectant cell lines that<br>
do not endogenously produce CCX-CKR2, as well as on cells that endogenously express<br>
CCX-CKR2, such as HeLa and MCF-7 (ATCC, VA). Additionally the antibodies were able<br>
to recognize the mouse homolog of CCX CKR2. For example, antibodies 6E10 and 11G8<br>
detected CCX-CR2 on the mouse mammary tumor cell line 4T1 and Lewis lung carcinoma<br>
cells (ATCC, Va). Antibodies 6E10 and 11G8, but not isotype controls were detected on an<br>
HEK 293 cell line transfected with CCX-CKR2, but did not bind to HEK 293 cells<br>
transfected with an empty vector or those expressing other chemokine receptors (e.g.,<br>
CXCR2).<br>
[130] The antibodies were also neutralizing, as demonstrated by radioligand<br>
competitive binding assays. Both antibodies 6E10 and 11G8 compete with both SDF-1 and<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/116319	PCT/US2006/015492<br>
I-TAC for binding to both mouse and human CCX-CKR2. Antibody 11G8 typically<br>
exhibited a greater percentage inhibition of chemokine binding than did antibody 6E10.<br>
[131] Antibodies 6E10 and 11G8 also recognize CCX-CKR2 in<br>
immunohistochemical (IHC) assays on fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. In<br>
experiments on various tissue types, IHC staining with antibodies 6E10 and 11G8 matched<br>
the expression patterns determined with binding assays incorporating radiolabeled SDF or I-<br>
TAC on the respective tissues. For instance CCX-CKR2 staining was found in sections of<br>
E13 fetal mouse, but not in sections of E17 fetal or adult mouse. CCX CKR2 staining was<br>
also seen in cytospins of cells stably expressing the human CCX-CKR2.<br>
[132] The heavy and light chain variable region coding sequence, and<br>
predicted amino acid sequences were determined. 6E10's heavy chain variable region is<br>
contained in SEQ ID NO: 12 (encoded by SEQ ID NO:11). 6E10's light chain variable region<br>
is contained in SEQ ID NO: 14 (encoded by SEQ ID NO:13). 1 lG8's heavy chain variable<br>
region is contained in SEQ ID NO: 16 (encoded by SEQ ID NO: 15). 11 G8's light chain<br>
variable region is contained in SEQ ID NO: 18 (encoded by SEQ ID NO: 17)<br>
[133] Although the invention has been described in some detail by way of<br>
illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be readily apparent to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes<br>
and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>

specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.<br>
