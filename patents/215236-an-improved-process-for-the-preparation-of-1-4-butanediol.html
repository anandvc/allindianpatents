				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 1,4-butanediol. More particularly it describes a process for 1,4-butanediol by hydrogenation of 2-butene-l,4-diol. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 1,4-butanediol from 2-butene-l,4-diol by hydrogenation using Raney nickel catalyst.<br>
1,4-Butanediol is an important intermediate in the manufacture of polyethers, polyols, copolyester ethers, elastomers, thermoplastic polyurethanes, and spandex fibers (M. L. Morgan, Chem. &amp; Industry, 1997, 166].<br>
In a prior art various methods have been described for the preparation of 1,4-butanediol. In one of the method, acetylene is reacted with formaldehyde to get 1,4-butynediol, which on two stage hydrogenation in presence of Pd on alumina resulted in the formation of 1,4-butanediol along with small amount of 4-hydroxybutyraldehyde and 2-butene-l,4-diol {Ger (east) DD 26539, (1989)}. In another method, 1,4-butanediol is prepared by hydrogenation of 2-butene-l,4-diol in presence of catalysts containing metal salts of Fe, Co, Ca, Cr, Ti and Ni impregnated on silicagel, at 10 atm. pressure and 80째C temperature (Japan Kokai 7449910 (1972)}. In yet another method, 1,4-butanediol is obtained in three step process from 1,3-butadiene by acetoxylation, hydrogenation followed by hydrolysis (a) US 3,922, 300 (1975); b) US 4,225,729 (1980)}. In yet another method, 1,4-butanediol is prepared from epoxybutene {US 3,932,468 (1975)}. ARCO has developed a three step process for 1,4-butanediol from propylene oxide, which includes isomerization of propylene oxide to allyl alcohol at 250 - 300째C and about 10 bar pressure, hydroformylation of allyl alcohol to 4-hydroxybutyraldehyde and hydrogenation of 4-hydroxy-butyraldehyde to 1,4-butanediol {(a) US 4,567,305 (1986); b) EP Appl No. 129802 Al (1984); c) US 4,537,997 (1985); d) US 4,465,873 (1984)}. In a similar method allyl ethers on hydroformulation, hydrogenation followed by hydrolysis gave 1,4-butanediol {(a) EP Appl. No. 18163 (1980); b) EP Appl. No. 18164 (1980)}. In a yet another process, 1,4-butanediol is obtained as by product along with tetrahydrofuran, is based on vapor phase hydrogenation of maleic anhydride or succenic anhydride, {(a) EP Appl. No. 147219 Bl (1989); (b) US 4,810,807(1989)}. In a yet another process 1,4-butanediol is produced as a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-butanediol, by reacting,<br><br>
1,3-butadiene with tert-butylhydroperoxide in the presence of a cobalt on silica catalyst, followed by-catalytic hydrogenation of di (tert-butylperoxy)butene obtained at 200-1300 psi H2 pressure {S. C. Tang and K. Tex, US 4,384,146 (1983)}. The hydrogenation of 1,4-butynediol and 2-buterie-l,4-diol over various palladium catalysts are carried out to get 1,4-butanediol [Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 1958, 31, 343].<br>
In most of the prior art process described hereinbefore involve more steps and are less selective, and moreover lead to the formation of mixture of products from which desired product, 1,4-butanediol, has to be separated. The drawback of some of the prior art are the hydrogenation step is carried out at very high pressure and temperature.<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 1,4-butanediol with very high selectivity and which do not have the limitations of the prior art processes, described herein above. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 1,4-butanediol, wherein the hydrogenation can be carried out at relatively lower temperature and pressure.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 1, 4-butanediol which comprises reducing a solution of 2-butene-1.4-diol in a solvent at a temperature ranging between 25 to 100째C and pressure of hydrogen in the range of 10 to 60 psi, in the presence of catalyst selected from hydroxides of Pd-C, PtO2 , raney nickel catalyst for a period ranging between 1 to 24 hrs., separating the solid catalyst by conventional method, neutralizing the filtrate with acid, removing the solvent, and isolating the product, 1,4-butanediol, by distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the solvent used may be such as water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetonitrile, THF, acetone.<br>
In an another embodiment the catalyst used may be such as Pd-C, Pt02 , Raney nickel catalyst. In yet another embodiment the acid used for neutralization may be such as HC1, H2S04, acetic<br><br>
acid, oxalic acid and the like.<br>
