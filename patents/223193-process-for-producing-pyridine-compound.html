Description Process for producing pyridine compound<br>
Technical Field<br>

Background Art<br>
The pyridine compounds [d]:<br>
Lwherein R1 represents a C1-C6 alkoxy group, R3 represents a halogen atom, cyano group or nitro group, and R4 represents a hydrogen atom or halogen atom] have excellent herbicidal activity.    The pyridine compounds [d] contain two heterocyclic rings which are uracil ring and pyridine ring, and a beneficial process to produce them is desired.    The object of the present invention is to provide a beneficial process for producing the pyridine compounds [d] having a specific pattern of substituents and starting compounds for the process.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors earnestly studied to find a beneficial process for producing the pyridine compounds [d].    As a result, they have found that the pyridine compound [d] can be produced by making a pyridone compound [a]:<br><br><br>
[wherein R3 and R4 represent the same meanings as defined above]<br>
react with ancrdiazoester compound [f]:<br>
N2 CHCORi	[f]<br>
[wherein R1 represents the same meaning as defined above]<br>
in the presence of an acid to proceed regioselective Oalkylation, and completed<br>
the present invention.    By adopting the present process, the pyridine compound<br>
[d] having the specific pattern of the substituents can be produced beneficially.<br>
Namely, the present invention provides a process for producing the pyridine compound [d] by making the pyridone compound [a] react with the crdiazoester compound [f] in the presence of an acid (hereinafter, referred to as the process of the present invention) and the pyridone compound [a] that is an important starting compound for the process.<br>
In the present invention, examples of the C1-C6 alkoxy group given for R1 include methoxy group, ethoxy group, propoxy group and so on, and examples of the halogen atom given for R3 and R4 include fluorine atom, chlorine atom and bromine atom.<br>

Examples of the solvent include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and so on; halogenated hydrocarbons such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and so on; and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
In the present method, the acid means an acid defined by G. N. Lewis, namely a substance that can accept electron, and includes aprotic acid and protic acid (Bronsted acid).

As the boron trifluoride, BF3 itself or its complex can be utilized, and examples of the complex include diethyl ether complex, dimethyl sulfide complex, tetrahydrofuran complex and so on.    In the view of reaction rate, it is preferable to use rhodium (II) trifluoroacetate dimmer, boron trifluoride/diethyl ether complex, tin tetrachloride or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as an acid.<br>

The reaction temperature of the present reaction is usually -50 to 120°C, preferably -20°C or more in the view of the reaction rate.    The reaction time is usually in the range of momentarily to 72 hours.<br>
The reagents utilized for the present reaction are added into a reaction vessel, for example, in the following order.<br>
1)	A method of mixing the pyridone compound [a], an acid and a solvent in advance, and adding the crdiazoester compound [f] dropwise therein.<br>

and a solvent in advance, and adding an acid dropwise therein.<br>
3) A method of mixing the pyridone compound [a] and a solvent in advance, and<br>
adding an acid and the crdiazoester compound [f] dropwise therein respectively.<br>
The end point of the present reaction can be detected by sampling a part of the reaction mixture, analyzing the sample by liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography and so on, and measuring the remained amount of the pyridone compound [a] or the crdiazoester compound [fj.<br>
After the reaction, the pyridine compound [d] can be obtained, for example, by subjecting the reaction mixture to the following work-up procedures:<br>
1)	filtering the reaction mixture and concentrating the filtrate.<br>
2)	subjecting the reaction mixture to silica gel chromatography, and then concentration.<br>
3)	pouring the reaction mixture to aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, extracting with an organic solvent, and drying and concentrating the organic layer.<br>
The obtained pyridine compound [d] can be purified by a procedure such as chromatography, recrystallization and so on.<br>
