PRINTER WITH A MEDIA UNIT WHICH CAN BE REMOVED THEREFROM AND<br>
WHICH IS LOCKABLE<br>
The invention relates to a printer, in particular the printer<br>
of a tachograph for a motor vehicle, having a housing, a<br>
printing unit, having a media unit to hold a medium that can be<br>
printed, which media unit can be moved relative to the printing<br>
unit along an insertion curve describing an insertion direction<br>
into an operating position and, counter to the insertion<br>
direction, out of an operating position, which media unit can<br>
be at least partly removed from the housing, which media unit<br>
can be locked in an operating position in the housing by means<br>
of a locking unit, which locking unit has at least one movable<br>
locking element which can be moved into a locked position and<br>
into an unlocked position, the locking element in the locked<br>
position engaging with at least one retaining element which is<br>
fixed to the housing.<br>
The focus of the application of the device according to the<br>
invention is in the area of tachographs or devices for<br>
registering the working times and rest times of commercial<br>
vehicle drivers. However, other applications are likewise<br>
conceivable, for example in the area of banking and finance.<br>
Because of the legal verification function of the working time<br>
data registered by means of the tachograph, this data must be<br>
documented in an unchanging way in a forgery-proof format. The<br>
statutory standard provides for the data to be printed out by<br>
means of a printer on specific, forgery-proof paper, in order<br>
to develop a legal evidential character. Therefore, the quality<br>
and the functional reliability<br><br>
of the printer of a tachograph will have strict measures<br>
applied to them. In order to meet these high requirements, in<br>
view of the operating conditions of these devices, which are to<br>
some extent extreme, the development faces a very great<br>
challenge. The rough operating conditions are distinguished by<br>
extreme temperature fluctuations between -40°C and 80°C and, at<br>
the same time, high atmospheric humidity, as well as high<br>
vibration and shock stresses. In addition, generic devices are<br>
mounted in different installation positions, so that, with<br>
regard to the dynamic mechanical stresses, they must be able to<br>
withstand the loadings in virtually all spatial directions<br>
without the availability of the device being impaired. The<br>
rough operating conditions are additionally intensified by<br>
regularly less careful operation of the device. At the same<br>
time, the usual standards with regard to operating convenience<br>
have to be taken into account, for example changing the media<br>
under the rather adverse conditions in the driver's cab of a<br>
motor vehicle must not degenerate into fiddly manual work. In<br>
addition, the only little overall space available makes it more<br>
difficult to implement a secure function and convenient<br>
operation with ruggedness at the same time.<br>
DP 102 15 122.9 has already disclosed a tachograph having a<br>
box-shaped housing and a generic printing device, in which the<br>
media unit can be removed from the housing for the purpose of<br>
reloading and can be fixed and locked in the housing by means<br>
of lock elements which interact with latching links. It is<br>
proposed to mount the lock element such that it can be rotated<br>
and to provide it with a latching hook which is assigned to a<br>
fixed-location latching link. Under the dynamic mechanical<br>
stresses already outlined, however, it has been shown<br><br>
that such a latching hook unlocks automatically in an unplanned<br>
manner, so that the media unit, which is formed in the manner<br>
of a drawer, unintentionally moves out of the housing of the<br>
tachograph. In this solution, the implementation is carried<br>
out in practice with two latching hooks, in each case arranged<br>
on one side of the media unit, the consequence of which is that<br>
from time to time only one latching hook is in engagement with<br>
the corresponding latching link, so that although the media<br>
unit is moved out of the operating position it is displaced, so<br>
that the printed image is impaired in an improper manner. In<br>
addition, the printing quality is subjected to high<br>
fluctuations.<br>
Starting from the disadvantages and problems of the prior art,<br>
the object of the invention is to provide a printer of the type<br>
mentioned at the beginning which, despite the rough operating<br>
conditions, exhibits a low failure rate with a high level of<br>
operating convenience and produces a good printed image.<br>
The achievement of the object according to the invention<br>
provides for the locking element to be capable of movement<br>
translationally transversely with respect to the insertion<br>
direction into a locked position and into an unlocked position.<br>
It has been shown that a translationally movable locking<br>
element provides higher security against shocks than a<br>
rotatably mounted one. According to the invention, by means of<br>
the locking unit, it is not only possible to keep the media<br>
unit, which can be displaced in the manner of a drawer, in the<br>
locked position in the housing but also to stabilize it. With<br><br>
the effect of.this double function, the locking unit aligns	the<br>
media unit more accurately in the operating position. By<br>
contrast, a rotatably mounted latching hook additionally has<br>
the disadvantage<br><br>
that either particularly large overtravel during locking and<br>
unlocking processes must be provided or extremely high<br>
prestressing forces have to be applied to the latching hook in<br>
the direction of a locked position in order to ensure the<br>
necessary security against shocks. These bracing forces<br>
increase when the printing unit and/or the media unit are<br>
prestressed counter to the insertion direction by means of a<br>
second resilient element and the locking unit must absorb these<br>
forces. Only the translational movement according to the<br>
invention transversely with respect to the insertion direction<br>
of the locking element ensures the necessary security against<br>
shocks.<br>
An advantageous development of the invention provides for the<br>
printer to have two retaining elements arranged with a spacing<br>
from each other which, in the locked position, engage with at<br>
least one locking element. The use of two retaining elements<br>
with a spacing is distinguished by incomparably precise<br>
retention of the media unit in the housing of the printer. In<br>
this way, torques can also be transmitted to the locking unit<br>
and the stabilization of the media unit according to the<br>
invention becomes possible.<br>
Expediently, the direction of the spacing between the two<br>
retaining elements extends at right angles to the direction in<br>
which the locking element or the locking elements can move. In<br>
this way, it is possible for forces occurring on the locking<br>
unit in the insertion direction not to move the locking<br>
element, for example out of the locked position. An<br>
orientation of the direction of the spacing between the<br>
retaining elements or of the force introduction regions<br><br>
of the forces from the locking elements is particularly<br>
expedient into the retaining elements<br><br>
arranged in a fixed manner in the housing, and perpendicular to<br>
the insertion direction and, in the case of two guides for the<br>
media unit extending in the insertion direction, a vertical<br>
orientation in relation to the plane described by these two<br>
guides. By means of such an arrangement of the locking unit,<br>
the media unit gains additional positional stability in the<br>
housing, since torques occurring in the housing transversely<br>
with respect to the insertion direction in the plane of the<br>
guides of the media unit can advantageously be absorbed by the<br>
locking unit and transmitted to the housing.<br>
The critical advantage of the translational direction of<br>
movement transversely with respect to the insertion direction<br>
of the locking element of the locking unit resides in the<br>
extremely far-reaching decoupling of the movement of the<br>
locking element from forces acting in the insertion direction.<br>
Here, in addition to the shock loadings occurring during proper<br>
operation, the forces from an ejection spring or another<br>
resilient element forcing the media unit counter to the<br>
insertion direction are primarily of importance. In addition<br>
to the necessary force for the ejection, such a second<br>
resilient element also ensures a secured position of the media<br>
unit in the housing, despite the play of the media unit<br>
required for mobility. In particular in the case of an<br>
operating unit arranged on the front panel of the media unit in<br>
an expedient and space-saving manner and actuating the locking<br>
unit, a high ejection force counter to the insertion direction<br>
is required, since the magnitude of this force must exceed the<br>
finger pressure of the user when actuating the operating<br>
element initiating the ejection.<br><br>
The locking unit advantageously has a first resilient element,<br>
which prestresses the locking element<br><br>
into the locked position. This arrangement, which is needed for<br>
shock resistance, can be improved still further according to<br>
the invention in terms of security against shocks since, on<br>
account of the decoupling of the forces of the movement of the<br>
locking unit from forces occurring in the insertion direction,<br>
the restoring force of the first resilient element, even in the<br>
case of operating elements arranged in a space-saving manner on<br>
the front panel of the media unit and initiating the ejection<br>
of the media unit, the operating force can be compensated for<br>
by means of a particularly powerful ejection spring. In<br>
addition, the restoring force from the ejection spring and the<br>
force from the first resilient element of the locking unit are<br>
linearly independent, which opens up new degrees of freedom for<br>
dimensioning.<br>
Additional ruggedness is imparted to the locking unit according<br>
to the invention if the locking unit has a slide-mounted<br>
carriage, which carries at least one locking element and can be<br>
moved into a locked position and into an unlocked position. The<br>
locking element expediently extends substantially perpendicular<br>
to the direction of movement of the carriage.<br>
For an extremely high level of stability, the carriage is<br>
designed to be elongated in the direction of movement, so that<br>
torques can also be transmitted to the sliding surface. In<br>
particular in the case of an elongated design, the carriage<br>
according to the invention is suitable as a carrier for at<br>
least one elongated locking element which extends with its<br>
longitudinal axis perpendicular to the direction of movement of<br>
the carriage. Given an elongated design of the carriage,<br>
torques oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the<br><br>
locking element and perpendicular to the direction of movement<br>
of the carriage can be transmitted<br><br>
from the media unit into the housing by means of the locking<br>
unit.<br>
The transmission of torques oriented in the insertion direction<br>
from the media unit into the housing by means of the locking<br>
unit imparts the optimal stability to the arrangement primarily<br>
when two retaining elements arranged with a spacing from each<br>
other are provided and locking elements corresponding to these<br>
are fitted to the carriage, the direction of the spacing<br>
between the retaining elements expediently being oriented<br>
perpendicular to the direction of movement of the carriage and<br>
perpendicular to the insertion direction.<br>
The transmission of higher supporting moments from the media<br>
unit to the locking unit in the insertion direction and<br>
transversely thereto is possible if the locking elements fixed<br>
to the carriage have at least two contact regions, with which<br>
they bear on the retaining elements in the locked position and<br>
the direction of the spacing between the two contact regions<br>
describes a straight line running substantially perpendicular<br>
to the direction of movement of the carriage.<br>
Further stability in the location of the media unit is achieved<br>
if the carriage of the locking unit is slide-mounted on at<br>
least one sliding plane and the sliding plane extends between<br>
the two contact regions, so that at least one locking element<br>
is arranged on both sides of the sliding mounting of the<br>
carriage.<br>
In relation to the ability to transfer the force components<br>
oriented in any direction from the media unit to the housing,<br><br>
it is advantageous if the two contact regions are located<br>
substantially<br><br>
on a single straight line described by a normal to the sliding<br>
plane of the carriage.<br>
Optimal interaction between the locking unit and guides of the<br>
media unit, which can be displaced in the manner of a drawer,<br>
results if the media unit is mounted such that it can be<br>
displaced along the insertion curve in guides, the direction of<br>
the spacing between the two contact regions of the locking unit<br>
extending substantially in the direction of the normal to a<br>
tangential plane described there by the guides.<br>
In order to ensure friction-free latching of the locking<br>
element in the associated retaining element, it is expedient if<br>
the locking element has a cylindrical shape, is elongated and<br>
the cylinder longitudinal axis runs perpendicular to the<br>
direction of movement. In the case of expediently hook-shaped<br>
retaining elements, a locking element designed in this way<br>
slides along the hook profile into the locked position<br>
virtually without friction.<br>
For space-saving reasons, it is expedient if the movable<br>
locking elements on the media unit are constituents fixed to<br>
the media unit. Under the limited overall space conditions, it<br>
has proven to be expedient to provide the operating element<br>
actuating the locking element on the front panel of the media<br>
unit, which necessitates arranging the movable locking elements<br>
on the media unit. In the same way, it is expedient if the<br>
stationary retaining elements are permanently connected to the<br>
housing and interact in a locking manner with the locking<br>
elements on the media unit.<br><br>
In order to avoid misprints, it is expedient if the movable<br>
parts of the locking unit interact with a sensor which<br>
registers a locked position, in which the media unit or the<br>
carrier and the printing unit are fixed in relation to each<br>
other in the direction of the spacing or, in a corresponding<br>
manner, an unlocked position.<br>
Because of the arrangement according to the invention of<br>
locking elements on a common carriage, one sensor is<br>
advantageously sufficient for registering the state of the<br>
locking unit. As compared with the use of a plurality of<br>
sensors for a plurality of locking elements, this firstly has<br>
the advantage that component costs are saved and secondly the<br>
functional advantage that contradictory status messages cannot<br>
come from the locking unit.<br>
The locking according to the invention gains special<br>
significance in interaction with a printing unit which can be<br>
moved in the housing within a movement play. A design of this<br>
type is able to increase the printing quality if means for<br>
aligning the printing unit in relation to the media unit are<br>
provided, so that the printing unit and the media unit are<br>
aligned with each other when the media unit is inserted in the<br>
insertion direction. The positional inaccuracy in relation to<br>
the printing unit resulting from the movement play of the media<br>
unit is in this way compensated for when it is inserted into<br>
the housing. The movement play of the printing unit in the<br>
housing extends primarily horizontally in the insertion<br>
direction, preferably with an order of magnitude of about 1 mm.<br>
In addition, a horizontal movement play transversely with<br>
respect to the insertion direction and of the same order of<br>
magnitude can be provided. A vertical movement play of about<br><br>
0.5 mm transversely with respect to the insertion direction is<br>
expedient on account of the special importance for the<br><br>
printing quality. In interaction with a second resilient<br>
element, which pushes or pulls the printing unit counter to the<br>
insertion direction with a force, so that the force urges the<br>
printing unit against the media unit when the latter is<br>
inserted, so that the printing unit is aligned with the<br>
inserted media unit, the preferred spatial movement play<br>
reliably ensures a reproducible relative position of the media<br>
unit in relation to the printing unit. In a design of the<br>
locking unit having at least two retaining elements, special<br>
security against shocks and positional stability of the media<br>
unit are ensured if the retaining elements are arranged<br>
symmetrically in relation to the second resilient element. A<br>
design of the second resilient element in such a way that it<br>
prestresses the printing unit in the housing against stops<br>
limiting the movement play when the media unit is not in the<br>
operating position reliably prevents uncontrolled, possibly<br>
destructive, movements of the printing unit in the housing in<br>
the absence of the media unit.<br>

In relation to some illustrations, the installed position is<br>
pointed out by means of an arrow O which points upward. The<br>
substantially box-shaped housing 2 illustrated in figure 1 is<br>
used to hold a tachograph 3 comprising a printer 1. The<br>
tachograph is provided with various operating elements 7 and an<br>
LCD display unit 9. Beside the LCD display unit 9 there is the<br>
front panel 12 of the printer 1. Under the front panel 12 and<br>
the LCD display unit 9 there are respectively holding openings<br>
15 for holding a card, not illustrated, comprising a data<br>
storage means. The front panel 12 of the printer 1 is a<br>
constituent part of a media unit 2 6 of the printer 1 and<br>
carries a first operating element 27 for actuating a locking<br>
unit 17 and a second operating element 25 for controlling the<br>
function of the printer 1.<br>
In figure 2, the housing 2 of figure 1 is illustrated in open<br>
form perspectively in a view from below, in the interior of the<br>
housing 2 only a carrier 10 of the media unit 26, having first<br>
guide elements 19a, 19b arranged at the sides, and the media<br>
unit 11 being illustrated. For the purpose of improved<br>
understanding, the electronics of the tachograph 3,<br><br>
the holding openings 15 for a chip card, second guide elements<br>
20 for guiding the first guide elements 19a, 19b, a transport<br>
unit 8 of the media unit 26, as important components, are not<br>
illustrated. The media unit 2 6 can be moved along the<br>
insertion curve 17 described by the first guide elements 19a,<br>
19b out of the housing 2 and into an operating position along<br>
an insertion direction 11 and counter to this direction. When<br>
the operating position is reached, the locking unit 17 latches<br>
in, holding the media unit 26 in the operating position in the<br>
housing 2.<br>
In figure 3, the floating mounting 90 of the printing unit 4,<br>
not illustrated in the other figures, is illustrated. The<br>
floating mounting 90 comprises a wing-like molding 91<br>
integrally molded on both sides of the printing unit 4, which<br>
is in each case arranged in a recess 92 which is a constituent<br>
part of a carrier element 93a, which also comprises the second<br>
guide elements 20a, 20b corresponding to the first guide<br>
elements 19a, 19b. The carrier elements 93a, 93b are firmly<br>
connected to a retaining element carrier 94 of the locking unit<br>
17, illustrated in figure 8, when they are mounted. In this<br>
case, the carrier elements 93a, 93b are centered on pins 95 on<br>
both sides of the side of the retaining element carrier 94 and<br>
latched by means of latching hooks 96. The moldings 91 arranged<br>
on both sides of the printing unit 4 in each case have a<br>
vertical movement play 97 of about 0.5 mm in the recesses 92 in<br>
the carrier element 93a, 93b, and a horizontal movement play 98<br>
in the insertion direction 11 of about 1 mm. Between the<br>
printing unit 4 and the carrier elements 93a, 93b, in addition<br>
a horizontal movement play of a total of 1 mm transversely with<br>
respect to the insertion<br><br>
direction is provided. It would be to the advantage of printing<br>
quality if the horizontal movement play in the<br><br>
insertion direction 11 and transversely thereto were in each<br>
case reduced to about 0.5 mm, but this would increase the<br>
expenditure on fabrication as compared with the movement play<br>
selected. In the same way, it is conceivable with a functional<br>
advantageous to reduce the vertical movement play down to 0.35<br>
mm. In a manner not illustrated, by means of a resilient<br>
element not illustrated, the printing unit 4 is prestressed<br>
counter to the insertion direction 11 in the recess 92 so as to<br>
butt up against the molding 91 of the floating mounting 90, so<br>
that the printing units 4 is always located in a defined<br>
position, even in the absence of the media unit 26.<br>
In figure 4, the media unit 26 is illustrated with its<br>
important components, a transport unit 8, the movable parts of<br>
the locking unit 17, the carrier 10 and a second resilient<br>
element 99 for ejecting the media unit 26. A transport unit 8<br>
of the media unit 26 has a transport roll 100 for the transport<br>
of the paper of a coiled strip, not illustrated but arranged in<br>
the holding space 101 between transport unit 8 and locking unit<br>
17. Arranged on the front side 104 of the transport unit 8 of<br>
the media unit 2 6 are centering elements 102 for holding the<br>
front panel 12 illustrated in figure 1. By means of the first<br>
operating element 27, an operating slide 103 of the locking<br>
unit 17 can be actuated and, in a manner illustrated in figure<br>
5, transports a carriage 106 of the locking unit 17 on the<br>
actuating slide 103 and on the carriage 106 by means of<br>
inclined siding planes 107a, 107b. The media unit 26 is<br>
prestressed in the housing 2, counter to the insertion<br>
direction 11, by means of a second resilient element 99 which<br>
is formed as a spiral spring and which is supported<br><br>
on the retaining element carrier 94 between a first retaining<br>
element 110a illustrated in figure 8 and a second retaining<br>
element 110b.<br><br>
On both sides of the transport roll 100, on a common shaft 114<br>
holding the transport roll 100, the transport unit 8 has<br>
alignment guides 115, which interact with corresponding<br>
recesses 116 of the printing unit 4 illustrated as a detail in<br>
figure 3 during a movement of the media unit 2 6 in the<br>
insertion direction 11, aligning the printing unit 4 in<br>
relation to the media unit 26. In the course of this<br>
alignment, the printing unit 4 is moved within the horizontal<br>
(98) and vertical (98) movement play. In this way, a<br>
compensation of the tolerance between the media unit 2 6 and the<br>
printing unit 4 is expediently carried out, which improves the<br>
printing quality decisively. In this case, the carriage 106 is<br>
guided such that it can be displaced on the carrier 10 of the<br>
media unit, slide-mounted along a sliding guide 117. The<br>
sliding guide 117 limits the mobility of the carriage 106 to<br>
just the translational degree of freedom of the locking<br>
movement. In this way, the sliding guide 117 of the carriage<br>
106 is also able to accommodate torques which are input by<br>
means of locking elements 50, 51 fixed to the carriage 106.<br>
From the illustration of figure 5, it is possible to gather<br>
that there is resiliently prestressed mounting of the first<br>
operating element 25 by means of a fourth resilient element<br>
120. In the finally mounted state, the fourth resilient<br>
element 120 interacts in a sealing manner with a collar 121 on<br>
the first operating element 27 and a sealing stop on the front<br>
panel 12, which extends in the peripheral direction of the<br>
first operating element 27 but is not specifically illustrated.<br>
The fourth resilient element 120 is in this case dimensioned<br>
and also prestressed in such a way that the<br><br>
arrangement comprising collar 121 and sealing stop of the front<br>
panel 12, managing without any additional resilient seal,<br><br>
meets protection class IP 54, in particular is sealed against<br>
spray.<br>
A first resilient element 13 of the locking unit 17 ensures a<br>
defined position of the locking elements 50, 51 and of the<br>
carriage 106 both in a locked position and an unlocked<br>
position.<br>
Figure 6 reveals the construction of the carriage 106 with<br>
locking elements 50, 51 and a sensor actuating element 130 in a<br>
perspective illustration. The carriage 106 is provided with a<br>
cylindrical hole 122, through which there extends a metal pin<br>
123, likewise cylindrical, which projects on both sides of a<br>
sliding surface 131 of the sliding guide 117 of the carriage<br>
106. The two projecting ends of the pin 123 embody the locking<br>
elements 50, 51.<br>
In the manner illustrated in figure 7, the sensor actuating<br>
element 150 actuates a sensor switch 135, which is arranged on<br>
a common printed circuit board 136 of the device. Within the<br>
context of an inward movement along the insertion direction 11<br>
of the carriage 106, the carriage 106 and, with it, the sensor<br>
actuating area 130, completes a curved (14 0) movement in order<br>
to actuate the sensor switch 135 along the slot-type guides of<br>
the hook profiles of the retaining elements 110a, 110b<br>
illustrated in figure 8, which force this curved movement (140)<br>
on the carriage 106 by means of the guide elements 50, 51. The<br>
actual locking movement of the carriage 106 and of the locking<br>
elements 50, 51 of the hook-like profiles of the retaining<br>
elements 110a, 110b runs perpendicular to<br><br>
the insertion direction 11, so that the restoring force of the<br>
second resilient element 99<br><br>
for the ejection of the media unit has no component in the<br>
direction of movement of the locking unit 17. The locking<br>
elements 50, 51 arranged on both sides of the sliding surface<br>
131 of the carriage 106, and therefore the contact regions 145,<br>
146 of the locking elements 50, 51, likewise arranged on both<br>
sides of this sliding surface 171, on the retaining elements<br>
110a, 110b likewise advantageously permit the transmission of<br>
torques oriented transversely with respect to the insertion<br>
direction 11 from the carriage 106, which is mounted so as to<br>
be stable against torques, to the retaining elements 110a, 110b<br>
of the locking unit 17. The second resilient element 99<br>
illustrated in figure 4 is arranged between the retaining<br>
elements 110a, 110b illustrated in figure 8 and symmetrically<br>
with respect to the locking elements 50, 51. This arrangement<br>
is illustrated once more in figure 9 for the purpose of<br>
clarification, in particular leaving out the carrier 10 with<br>
the torque-stable guidance 132 of the carriage 106.<br>
The perspective illustration of figure 10 shows the complete<br>
media unit in an overall view with the retaining element<br>
carrier 94, leaving out the printing unit 4, so that the action<br>
of inserting the media unit 26 along the insertion curve 70 in<br>
the insertion direction 11 is illustrated. Subsequently, not<br>
illustrated, the locking elements 50, 51 move along the<br>
retaining elements 110a, 110b of the locking unit, so that the<br>
media unit 2 6 is retained on the retaining element carrier 94<br>
under the prestress of the second resilient element 108, and<br>
thus in a locked position in the housing.<br><br>
