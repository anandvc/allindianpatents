				<td>A METHOD FOR SELECTING A RESOURCE FROM A PLURALITY RESOURCES<br>
This invention relates to distributed computer systems, and in particular, to the selection of system<br>
resources by a constituent processor of a distributed computer system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A distributed computer system includes a large number of processors, each with its own local<br>
memory. These processors all share a common memory. The common memory includes several queues in<br>
which are listed instructions for various processing tasks waiting to be performed. When a processor<br>
becomes free, it selects one of these queues and carries out the processing task waiting at the front of the<br>
queue.<br>
In selecting a queue, the processor attempts to minimize the waiting time of each processing task in<br>
each queue. Since waiting time depends, in part, on queue length, it is useful for the processor to know<br>
how many tasks are waiting in each queue before selecting a queue.<br>
In a distributed computer system, several other processors are constantly adding and deleting<br>
processing tasks from the queues. This causes the length of each queue to change unpredictably. As a<br>
result, in order for a processor to know the length of a queue, it must take the time to poll the queue.<br>
However, if each processor, upon completing a processing task, were to poll each queue, the overhead<br>
associated with selecting a queue becomes unacceptably high.<br>
A distributed computer system occasionally communicates with other distributed computer<br>
systems. To do so, a sending processor from a source distributed computer system sends a message to one<br>
of the constituent processors on a target distributed computer system. A prerequisite to doing so is the<br>
selection of a receiving processor from among the constituent processors of the target system.<br>
Preferably, a sending processor selects, as the receiving processor, that processor on the target<br>
system that is the least busy. However, in doing so, the sending processor faces a problem similar to that<br>
described above in the context of selecting a queue. Short of polling each processor in the target system,<br>
there is no simple and reliable mechanism for identifying the processor that is the least busy.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
The problem of selecting a receiving processor and selecting a queue are examples<br>
of the more general problem of selecting a resource on the basis of a stochastic property of<br>
that resource. Rather than attempt to determine with certainty the value of the stochastic<br>
property for each resource, the method of the invention selects resources probabilistically,<br>
using estimates of the current, or present values of the stochastic property for each of the<br>
available resources.<br>
One method for selecting a resource from a plurality of resources, includes<br>
determining a score for that resource on the basis of a stochastic property of the resource<br>
and then defining an interval corresponding to the resource. The extent of that interval is<br>
selected to depend on the score for that resource. A random number, is then generated and<br>
that resource is selected if the random number falls within the interval defined for that<br>
resource. The random number can, but need not be, uniformly distributed over the set of all<br>
intervals associated with the plurality of resources.<br>
The method thus has the quality of spinning a roulette wheel having as many slots<br>
as there are resources to select from, with the extent of each slot being dependent on the<br>
value of the stochastic property of the resource associated with that slot This ensures that<br>
resources having desirable values of that stochastic property are more likely to be selected<br>
but that all resources have some probability of being selected.<br>
In a first practice of the invention, the resource is selected to be a queue and the<br>
stochastic property of the resource is the queue-length of the queue. In a second practice of<br>
the invention, the resource is a processor and the stochastic property is the workload of that<br>
processor.<br>
In both cases, the method includes determining a score for each resource from the<br>
plurality of resources available for selection. This includes estimating a present value of the<br>
stochastic property of that resource, typically on the basis of prior measurements of that<br>
stochastic property. In one aspect of the invention, the prior measurement is the last-known<br>
value, or most recent measurement of that stochastic property for the resource in question.<br>
The extent of the interval associated with a particular resource depends on the score<br>
associated with that resource. In one practice of the invention, the extend depends on the<br><br>
normalized score for that resource. The score determined for a resource can be normalized<br>
by evaluating a sum of scores assigned to each resource in the plurality of resources and<br>
normalizing the score assigned to the resource by the sum of scores.<br>
The method also includes an optional step of periodically updating the<br>
measurements upon which an estimate of a current value of a stochastic property are based.<br>
In one practice of the invention, a resource that has been selected is also polled to<br>
determine the current value of the stochastic property for that resource. This current value<br>
then becomes the new last-known value for the stochastic property of that resource.<br>
These and other features of the invention will be apparent from the following<br>
detailed description and the accompanying figures in which:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A data-storage system 10 for that carries out a resource selection method, as shown in FIG.<br>
1, includes several adaptors 12 that interface with external devices. These external devices<br>
can be data storage devices 14, such as disk drives, in which case the adaptors are called<br>
"disk adaptors." The external devices can also be hosts 16, or processing systems that are<br>
directly accessed by users of the data-storage system 10, in which case they are referred to<br>
as "host adaptors." The external devices can also be remote data-storage systems 18 for<br>
mirroring data in the data-storage system 10, in which case the adaptors are referred to as<br><br>
"remote adaptors." Each adaptor 12 includes its own processor 20 and a local memory 22<br>
available to the processor 20.<br>
The data-storage system 10 also includes a common memory 24 that is accessible to<br>
all the adaptors. The common memory 24 functions as a staging area for temporary storage<br>
of data. The use of a common memory 24 improves performance of the data-storage system<br>
10 by reducing the latency associated with accessing mass storage devices.<br>
The various adaptors 12 in the data-storage system 10 cooperate with each other to<br>
assure an orderly flow of data from the common memory 24 to or from the mass storage<br>
devices 14, hosts 16, and mirror sites 18. To cooperate effectively, the adaptors 12 must<br>
communicate with each other. This communication is implemented by maintaining one or<br>
more queues 26 in a queue portion 28 of the common memory 24, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
When an adaptor 32 requires that a particular task be executed by another adaptor, it<br>
leaves, on a queue 26 within the queue portion 28, a message 30 requesting that the task be<br>
carried out. An adaptor 34 scanning the queue can then encounter the message 30 and<br>
execute that task.<br>
Throughout the remainder of this specification, the adaptor 32 leaving the message<br>
is referred to as the "request-adaptor;" the adaptor 34 that carries out the task specified in<br>
the message is referred to as the "execution-adaptor." It is understood, however, that these<br>
are logical designations only. Disk adaptors, host adaptors, and remote adaptors can each<br>
take on the role of a request-adaptor 32 or an execution-adaptor 34 at various times during<br>
the operation of the data-storage system 10.<br>
Certain tasks in the data-storage system 10 are urgent and must be carried out<br>
promptly. Other tasks are less time-sensitive. To accommodate this, the data-storage<br>
system 10 assigns different priorities to the queues 26. When a request-adaptor 32 has a<br>
task to be executed, it determines the priority of the task and places it in the queue 26<br>
whose priority is appropriate to the urgency of the task.<br>
Each queue 26 contains a varying number of messages 30. This number is referred<br>
to as the queue-length. The queue-length has a lower bound of zero and an upper bound<br>
that depends on the configuration of the disk-storage system 10. In the course of normal<br>
operation, request-adaptors 32 add new messages to the queue 26 and execution-adaptors<br><br>
34 cany out requests specified in messages and delete those messages from the queue 26.<br>
As a result, the queue-length is a time-varying random number.<br>
When an execution-adaptor 34 becomes free to execute a processing task, it selects<br>
a queue 26 and executes the processing task specified by a topmost message 36 in that<br>
queue 26. The execution-adaptor 34 selects the queue 26 so as to minimize the waiting<br>
time for all pending messages in all queues. In most cases, this requires that the execution-<br>
adaptor 34 select the queue 26 having the greatest queue-length.<br>
Because the queue-length is a time-varying random number, the execution-adaptor<br>
34 cannot know with certainty the length of each queue 26 at the moment when it is<br>
necessary to select a queue 26. Even if the execution-adaptor 34 were to incur the overhead<br>
associated with polling each queue 26, it would be possible for other adaptors 12 to add or<br>
delete a message 30 from a queue 26 that has just been polled by the execution-adaptor 34.<br>
This introduces error into the execution-adaptor"s assessment of the queue-lengths.<br>
To avoid having to poll each queue 26 whenever it becomes free to carry out a<br>
request from one of the queues, the execution-adaptor 34 caches, in its local memory 22, a<br>
queue-length table 38 listing the length of each queue 26 at the time that the execution-<br>
adaptor 34 last carried out a request pending on that queue 26. The table-entries in the<br>
queue-length table 38 are thus the last-known queue-lengths for each queue 26. These last-<br>
known queue-lengths function as estimates of the queue-lengths at the moment when the<br>
execution adaptor 34 selects a queue 26.<br>
The execution-adaptor 34 updates a queue"s entry in the queue-length table 38<br>
whenever it accesses that queue 26 to carry out a request. Since the execution-adaptor 34<br>
already has to access the queue 26 in order to carry out a request pending on that queue 26,<br>
there is little additional overhead associated with polling the queue 26 to obtain its queue-<br>
length.<br>
The execution-adaptor 34 also maintains a priority table 40 listing the priority<br>
values assigned to each queue 26. A high-priority queue is characterized by a large integer<br>
in the priority table 40. Lower priority tables are characterized by smaller integers in the<br>
priority table 40.<br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, the execution-adaptor 34 selects a queue 26 by first<br>
assigning 42 a score to each queue 26. ft does so by weighting the estimate of the queue-<br>
length for each queue 26 with the priority assigned to that queue 26. The result is referred<br>
to as the "effective queue-length" for that queue 26. The execution-adaptor 34 then sums<br>
44 the effective queue-lengths for all queues 26 and defines 46 a sampling interval 48<br>
having an extent equal to that sum, as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The execution adaptor 34 then divides 50 the sampling interval 48 into as many<br>
queue-intervals 52 as there are queues 26. Each queue-interval 52 has an extent that<br>
corresponds to the effective queue-length of the queue 26 with which it is associated. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the extent of each queue-interval 52 is the effective queue-length<br>
normalized by the extent of the sampling interval 48. In addition, each queue-interval 52 is<br>
disjoint from all other queue-intervals. As a result, each point on the sampling interval is<br>
associated with one, and only one, queue 26.<br>
Once the queue-intervals 50 are defined, the execution-adaptor 34 executes 54 a<br>
random number process 56 (see FIG. 2) that generates a random number having a value<br>
that is uniformly distributed over the sampling interval 48. The random number will thus<br>
have a value that places it in one of the queue-intervals 52 that together form the sampling<br>
interval 48. The probability that the random number will be in any particular queue-interval<br>
52 depends on the last-known effective queue-length of the queue 26 corresponding to that<br>
queue-interval relative to the last-known effective queue-lengths of all other queues.<br>
The execution-adaptor 34 then accesses 58 the queue 26 corresponding to the<br>
queue-interval 52 that contains the random number and carries out 60 the task specified by<br>
the topmost message 36 in that selected queue 26. Once the task is completed, the<br>
execution-adaptor 34 deletes 62 the topmost message 36 from the selected queue 26 and<br>
polls 64 the selected queue 26 to obtain its queue-length. The execution-adaptor 34 then<br>
updates 66 the entry in its queue-length table 38 that corresponds to the selected queue 26.<br>
By using a locally-cached last-known queue-length to formulate an estimate of a<br>
current effective queue-length, the queue-selection method described above avoids polling<br>
each queue 26 to obtain its current queue-length. The foregoing queue-selection method<br>
can thus rapidly select a queue 26 that, while not guaranteed to be have longest effective<br>
queue-length, most likely does. Because each queue 26 has some probability of being<br><br>
selected, the queue-selection method described above also avoids neglecting any queue 26.<br>
This ensures that tasks waiting on queues having a low effective queue-length are<br>
nevertheless performed within a reasonable waiting period. This also ensures that queues<br>
having a low effective queue-length are occasionally polled to see if their effective queue-<br>
lengths have changed.<br>
A data-storage system 10 can be configured to maintain several queues 26 all of<br>
which have the same priority. A data-storage system 10 offers more flexibility in load<br>
balancing than a data-storage system having only a single queue because in such a system,<br>
several adaptors can carry out pending requests simultaneously.<br>
The foregoing method can also be carried out in a data-storage system 10 in which<br>
all the queues 26 have the same priority. In such a data-storage system 10, the effective<br>
queue-length can be set equal to the queue-length, in which case the priority table 40 is<br>
unnecessary. Alternatively, the entries in the priority table 40 can be set equal to each other.<br>
The method described above can be adapted to select any resource on the basis of a<br>
stochastic property of that resource. In the application described above, the resource is a<br>
queue 26 and the stochastic property that provides the basis for selection is the length of<br>
that queue. In the application that follows, the resource is a remote adaptor on a remote<br>
mirroring site 18 and the stochastic property that provides the basis for selection is the<br>
processing workload associated with the remote adaptor.<br>
A distinction between the two cases is that in the first case, it is preferable to select<br>
the resource having a high value of the stochastic property and in the second case, it is<br>
preferable to select the resource having a low value of the stochastic property. This<br>
distinction is readily accommodated in the second case by working with the inverse of the<br>
stochastic property rather than with the stochastic property directly.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a first data-storage system 68 sometimes communicates<br>
with a second data-storage system 70. For example, when a host adaptor 72 associated with<br>
the first data-storage system 68 writes to a device 74 that is mirrored on a mirror device 76<br>
controller by a disk adaptor 78 associated with the second data-storage system 70, a remote<br>
adaptor 80 on the first data-storage system 68 establishes communication with a selected<br>
remote adaptor 82 on the second data-storage system 70. The remote adaptor on the first<br><br>
data-storage system 68 will be referred to as the "sending adaptor" 80 and the remote<br>
adaptors on the second data-storage system 70 will be referred to as the "receiving<br>
adaptors" 82. Each remote adaptor 80, 82 has its own processor 82 and local memory 84.<br>
It is understood that the designations "receiving adaptor" and "sending adaptor" are<br>
logical designations only. For example, the second data-storage system 70 may have<br>
devices that are mirrored on the first data-storage system 68, in which case a remote<br>
adaptor 82 of the second data storage system 70 can function as a sending adaptor and a<br>
remote adaptor 80 on the first data storage system 68 can function as a receiving adaptor.<br>
In establishing communication, the sending adaptor 80 selects one of the available<br>
receiving adaptors 82. Preferably, the sending adaptor 80 selects the receiving adaptor 82<br>
that is the least busy. However, because of the overhead associated with communicating<br>
with the receiving adaptors 82, it is impractical for the sending adaptor 80 to poll each of<br>
the receiving adaptors 82 to determine which of the receiving adaptors 82 is the least busy.<br>
In addition, the sending adaptor 80 cannot know with certainty whether the<br>
information it relies upon in selecting a receiving adaptor 82 is accurate. For example, it is<br>
possible that, in the brief interval between being polled by a sending adaptor 80 and being<br>
asked to carry out a task by the sending adaptor 80, a receiving adaptor 82 may have taken<br>
on requests sent by other sending adaptors 80.<br>
To avoid having to poll each receiving adaptor 82, the sending adaptor 80<br>
maintains, in its local memory 84, a workload table 86 having information indicative of the<br>
workload carried by each receiving adaptor 82 at the time that the sending adaptor 80 last<br>
engaged in an I/O transaction with that receiving adaptor 82. The workload associated with<br>
a particular receiving adaptor 82 is thus the last-known workload for that receiving adaptor<br>
82. The receiving-adaptor selection method uses the last-known workloads of the receiving<br>
adaptors in the workload table 86 to estimate how busy each receiving adaptor 82 is at the<br>
time that the sending adaptor 80 selects a receiving adaptor 82.<br>
The sending adaptor 80 updates the corresponding entry in the workload table 88<br>
entry for each receiving adaptor 82 whenever it engages in an I/O transaction with that<br>
receiving adaptor 82. Since the sending adaptor 80 already had to establish communication<br>
with the receiving adaptor 82 in order to engage in an I/O transaction with that adaptor 82,<br><br>
there is little additional overhead associated with polling the receiving adaptor 82 to obtain<br>
a measure of how busy that receiving adaptor 82 currently is. In response to polling by the<br>
sending adaptor 80, the receiving adaptor 82 provides an integer indicative of the number<br>
of tasks it is handling concurrently.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, selection of a receiving adaptor 82 with which to communicate<br>
begins with the sending adaptor 80 assigning 88 a score to each receiving adaptor 82. The<br>
sending adaptor 80 does so by weighting the reciprocal of the table entry associated with<br>
each receiving adaptor 82 by an integer large enough to avoid time-consuming floating<br>
point operations in the steps that follow. The resulting score is referred to as the "inverse<br>
workload" for that receiving adaptor 82. The sending adaptor 80 then sums 90 the inverse<br>
workloads for all receiving adaptors 82 and defines 92 a sampling interval 94 having a<br>
length equal to that sum, as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
The sampling interval 94 is then subdivided 96 into as many sub-intervals 98 as<br>
there are receiving adaptors 82. Each sub-interval 98 has a length that corresponds to the<br>
inverse workload of the receiving adaptor 82 with which it is associated. In addition, each<br>
sub-interval 98 is disjoint from all other sub-intervals. As a result, each point on the<br>
sampling interval 94 is associated with one, and only one, receiving adaptor 82.<br>
Once the sub-intervals are defined, the sending adaptor 80 executes 100 a random<br>
number process 102 that generates a random number having a value that is uniformly<br>
distributed over the sampling interval 94. The random number will thus have a value that<br>
places it in a sub-interval 98 corresponding to one of the receiving adaptors 82. The<br>
probability that the random number will be in a sub-interval 98 corresponding to a<br>
particular receiving adaptor 82 depends on the inverse workload of that receiving adaptor<br>
82 relative to the inverse workloads of all other receiving adaptors.<br>
The sending adaptor 80 then establishes 104 communication with and sends 106 a<br>
message to the selected receiving adaptor 82 corresponding to the sub-interval 98<br>
associated with the value of the random number. The sending adaptor 80 then polls 108 the<br>
receiving adaptor 82 to obtain a new estimate of its workload and updates 110 the entry in<br>
its workload table 86 that corresponds to that receiving adaptor 82.<br><br>
By using a locally-cached last-known workload rather than polling each receiving<br>
adaptor 82 to obtain a current workload, the sending adaptor 80 can rapidly select a<br>
receiving adaptor 82 that, although not guaranteed to have the smallest workload, most<br>
likely does. Because each receiving adaptor 82 has some probability of being selected, the<br>
probabilistic selection process described above avoids neglecting any receiving adaptor 82.<br>
This ensures load balancing among the receiving adaptors 82. This also ensures that<br>
receiving adaptors 82 that were once found to be busy are occasionally polled to see if they<br>
have since become relatively idle.<br>

4. The method as claimed in claim 1, which involves selecting said resource to be a processor<br>
having a variable workload.<br>
5. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein determining a score for said resource comprises<br>
obtaining an estimate of a present workload of said processor.<br>
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, which involves selecting said resource to be a queue having<br>
a variable queue-length, and wherein determining said score comprises determining an effective queue-<br>
length of said queue.<br>
7. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein determining said effective queue-length comprises<br>
estimating a queue-length of said queue and determining a priority of said queue and wherein<br>
determining said score comprises weighting said queue-length with said priority.<br>
There is disclosed a method for selecting a resource from a plurality of resources, said<br>
method comprising : determining a score (42) for said resource on the basis of a stochastic property of<br>
said resource (44) ; defining an interval (46) corresponding to said resource, said interval having an<br>
extent that depends on said score ; generating a random number (54) ; and selecting said resource if<br>
said random number is within said interval.</td>
