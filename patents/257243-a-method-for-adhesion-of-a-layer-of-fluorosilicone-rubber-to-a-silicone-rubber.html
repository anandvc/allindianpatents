				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001] The present invention relates to an enhanced method for the adhesion of a<br>
fluorosilicone rubber which is curable using a non-hydrosilylation curing process to an<br>
alternative silicone rubber which is curable using a non-hydrosilylation curing process and to<br>
products made using said method.<br>
[0002] Fluorosilicone rubber compositions, particularly those which are based on an<br>
organopolysiloxane polymer having a large proportion of fluoroalkyl, particularly<br>
perfluoroalkyl groups, when cured, possess properties rendering them resistant to heat,<br>
frost, chemicals, and exposure to oil. These compositions are therefore widely used in the<br>
automotive and aircraft industries. However, one major problem with cured fluorosilicone<br>
rubber is that it does not adhere well to other substrates such as other silicone rubber<br>
compositions.<br>
[0003] Various methods have been proposed for improving adhesion of fluorosilicone<br>
rubbers to alternative silicone rubber based substrates and other substrate surfaces. These<br>
include the addition of materials containing multiple silicon-hydrogen bonds or multiple<br>
alkenyl groups in either the fluorosilicone rubber and /or other silicone rubber to enhance<br>
adhesion. The introduction of adhesion promoters such as cyanurate and/or isocyanurate<br>
based compounds for example triallyl cyanurate or triallyl isocyanurate in either the<br>
fluorosilicone rubber and /or other silicone rubber may also be used but can result in<br>
compatibility problems.<br>
[0004] JP 01-38149 describes a method for adhering fluorosilicone rubber to a metal<br>
surface by contacting the fluorosilicone rubber composition with a metal surface that has<br>
been treated with a primer composition containing vinyltrimethoxysilane and 2,4,4-trimethyl-<br>
pentyl-2-hydroperoxide. This composition is then heated and cured. A disadvantage of this<br>
method is the cost of the primer composition because it contains a specific organic peroxide.<br>
Another disadvantage is the non-uniform adhesion of the fluorosilicone rubber to the<br>
substrate.<br>
[0005] In EP 0798344 a fluorosilicone rubber composition is provided which incorporates<br>
a polyorganohydrogensiloxane having at least two silicon-hydrogen bonds wherein groups<br>
other than silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms are represented by substituted or non-substituted<br><br>
monovalent hydrocarbon groups such as C1 to C6 linear and/or branched alkyl groups;<br>
alkenyl groups such as vinyl or allyl groups; aryl groups such as phenyl; and 3,3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl groups.<br>
[0006] The use of such a compound provides enhanced adhesion to substrates when<br>
combined with a primer composition having a main component in the form of an<br>
organoalkoxysilane that contains alkenyl groups, and then heating and curing. Other<br>
components of the primer compositions include organic titanium acid esters, organic<br>
solvents, and platinum compounds. Curing of the fluorosilicone rubber composition, with<br>
simultaneous attachment thereof to the substrate surface, is performed by spreading the<br>
primer composition over the substrate, drying said primer composition in air for at least 30<br>
minutes, contacting the fluorosilicone rubber composition with the surface of the primed<br>
substrate, and then heating and adhering the fluorosilicone rubber to the substrate under a<br>
pressure of 100 to 250 kgf/cm2 applied for 5 to 20 minutes at a temperature of between 170<br>
to 190Â°C.<br>
[0007] US4465805 describes hydrocarbon liquid resistant fluorosilicones suitable for<br>
coating onto substrates.<br>
[0008] In a first embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for the<br>
adhesion of a layer of fluorosilicone rubber which is curable using a non-hydrosilylation<br>
curing process to a layer of silicone rubber which contains substantially no perfluoroalkyl<br>
groups and which is curable using a non-hydrosilylation curing process, comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
i) incorporating either a hydrosilylation catalyst or a siloxane containing at least<br>
two silicon bonded hydrogen groups into the fluorosilicone rubber composition<br>
prior to curing and;<br>
ii) incorporating the other of the hydrosilylation catalyst or the siloxane<br>
containing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen groups into the alternative<br>
silicone rubber composition prior to curing;<br>
iii) forming the products of step (i) and step (ii) into required shapes;<br>
iv) bringing the shaped products of step (iii) into contact with each other; and<br>
v) adhering the shaped products in contact with each other together by effecting<br>
a hydrosilylation reaction therebetween.<br><br>
[0009] In one embodiment of the present invention either the product of step (i) or the<br>
product of step (ii) may be pre-cured prior to step (v). Alternatively both the product of step<br>
(i) and the product of step (ii) are cured simultaneously with the progress of the<br>
hydrosilylation reaction in step (v). If required pressure may be applied when adhering the<br>
two products together. The reaction at the interface between the fluorosilicone rubber<br>
product and the high consistency silicone rubber product may take place at room<br>
temperature or at any temperature from room temperature up to about 200Â°C.<br>
[0010] The fluorosilicone polymer composition utilised in step (i) may be any suitable<br>
fluorosilicone rubber composition.<br>
[0011] Preferably the fluorosilicone polymer composition comprises the following<br>
components<br>
A)	a fluorinated polydiorganosiloxane polymer;<br>
B)	one or more reinforcing and/or non-reinforcing fillers<br>
C)	a suitable non-hydrosilylation cure catalyst<br>
[0012] Preferably the fluorinated polydiorganosiloxane A has a degree of polymerization<br>
greater than 1000, and/or a viscosity of at least 10 000 mPa.s at 25Â°C and comprises<br>
fluorinated siloxane units, and optionally non fluorinated siloxane units. The fluorinated<br>
siloxane units preferably have the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
each R" may be the same or different and denotes a branched or linear fluoroalkyl radical<br>
having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms;<br>
each Q may be the same or different and denotes a divalent hydrocarbon containing at least<br>
two carbon atoms, a hydrocarbon ether or a hydrocarbon thioether. Each R" radical is<br>
linked to a silicon atom via a Q group,<br>
each R" is the same or different and denotes an optionally substituted saturated or<br>
unsaturated silicon-bonded, monovalent hydrocarbon group,<br>
wherein a = 0 to 2, b= 0 to 2 and when a is 0 at least one R' group per unit contains one or<br>
more carbon-fluorine bonds.<br><br>
[0013] For the purpose of this application "Substituted" means one or more hydrogen<br>
atoms in a hydrocarbon group has been replaced with another substituent. Examples of<br>
such substituents include, but are not limited to, halogen atoms such as chlorine, fluorine,<br>
bromine, and iodine; halogen atom containing groups such as chloromethyl, perfluorobutyl,<br>
trifluoroethyl, and nonafluorohexyl; oxygen atoms; oxygen atom containing groups such as<br>
(meth)acrylic and carboxyl; nitrogen atoms; nitrogen atom containing groups such as amino-<br>
functional groups, amido-functional groups, and cyano-functional groups; sulphur atoms; and<br>
sulphur atom containing groups such as mercapto groups.<br>
[0014] Examples of suitable saturated R' radicals include alkyl radicals, such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, octyl, isooctyl and decyl. Preferably, when<br>
a is &gt;0 at least 90 percent, and more preferably with the exception of alkenyl radicals, all of<br>
the R' radicals in the fluorosilicone polymer are methyl radicals. Preferably when a is 0, on<br>
average about at least one R'" per unit contains at least one carbon -fluorine bond and most<br>
preferably is CF3-.<br>
[0015] Preferably R" denotes a fluoroalkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, over<br>
the complete range of from 5 to 100 mol% fluorinated siloxane units. Each fluoroalkyl radical<br>
present has at least one -C-F bond. The R" radicals can be identical or different and can<br>
have a normal or a branched structure. Preferably at least some, most preferably at least<br>
50% of the fluoroalkyl groups are perfluoroalkyl groups. Examples thereof include CF3-,<br>
C2F5-, C3F7-, such as CF3CF2CF2- or (CF3)2CF-, C4Fg-, such as CF3CF2CF2CF2-,<br>
(CF3)2CFCF2-, (CF3)3C- and CF3CF2(CF3)CF-; C5F11 such as CF3CF2CF2CF2CF2-, C6F13-,<br>
such as CF3(CF2)4CF2-; C7F14-, such as CF3(CF2CF2)3-; and C8F17-.<br>
[0016] Although this invention has not been investigated with polymers containing<br>
perfluoroalkyl radicals larger than perfluorooctyl, it is reasonable, and within the scope and<br>
spirit of the present invention, that R" can be C9F19-, C10F21-, and larger. However, it is clear<br>
that polymers containing perfluoroalkyl radicals containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, depending<br>
upon the amount of fluorinated siloxane units in the fluorosilicone polymer, provide excellent<br>
results and that the use of larger perfluoroalkyl radicals would only provide incremental<br>
improvements at higher cost.<br><br>
[0017] Each perfluoroalkyl radical is bonded to a silicon atom by way of Q, a divalent<br>
spacing radical containing carbon, hydrogen and, optionally, oxygen and/or sulphur atoms<br>
which are present as ether and thioether linkages, respectively. The sulphur and oxygen<br>
atoms, if present, must be bonded to only carbon atoms.<br>
[0018] Each Q radical can have any structure containing the elements listed; however,<br>
each is preferably an alkylene radical having a normal or branched structure. Examples of<br>
suitable alkylene radicals include -CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2-, (CH2CH2)2- and<br>
-CH(CH3)CH2CH2- and .<br>
[0019] Each fluorinated radical, R"Q, preferably has the formula RXH2CH2-.<br>
[0020] Optionally the fluorinated polyorganosiloxane additionally comprises a proportion,<br>
preferably of less than 25%, more preferably less than 15% of the total number of units per<br>
molecule of non-fluorinated siloxane units having the formula<br><br>
wherein R'" denotes an optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated silicon-bonded,<br>
monovalent hydrocarbon group, wherein c = 0 to 3 but preferably the average value of c is<br>
about 2. Each R'" contains no fluorine (and therefore R'" cannot contain any of the fluoro<br>
containing substituents mentioned in the general definition of "substituted groups" above.<br>
[0021] As previously indicated R'" denotes an optionally substituted saturated or<br>
unsaturated silicon-bonded, monovalent hydrocarbon group. Preferably each R'" may be<br>
the same or different and are selected from C1 to C10 alkyl groups; alkenyl groups such as<br>
vinyl or allyl groups; and/or aryl groups such as such as phenyl, tolyl, benzyl, beta-<br>
phenylethyl, and styryl. Preferably at least two R'" substituents per molecule are alkenyl<br>
groups, most preferably vinyl groups.<br>
[0022] In one preferred embodiment of the invention the fluorosilicone polymer contains at<br>
least two alkenyl groups having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably vinyl groups.<br>
[0023] Examples of Component A include copolymers of dimethylsiloxy units and (3,3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl) methylsiloxy units; copolymers of dimethylsiloxy units, (3,3,3-<br><br>
trifluoropropyl)methylsiloxy units, and vinylmethylsiloxy units; copolymers of (3,3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl)methylsiloxy units and vinylmethylsiloxy units; and poly(3,3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl)methylsiloxane. The terminal group on the molecular chains thereof being<br>
selected from a trimethylsiloxy group, vinyldimethylsiloxy group, dimethylhydroxysiloxy<br>
group, and (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)methylhydroxysiloxy group.<br>
[0024] In a further alternative component (A) may be chain extended. Any suitable form of<br>
chain extender may be utilised but one particularly preferred for component (A) herein is a<br>
chain extended polymer having pendant alkenyl groups only at the location of the chain<br>
extension. The alkenyl groups are preferably vinyl groups. Such polymers can be prepared<br>
by polymerizing a hydroxyl end-blocked trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane in the presence of an<br>
alkylalkenyldi (N-alkylacetamido) silane such as described in EP 0542471, the contents of<br>
which are hereby incorporated.<br>
[0025] Any suitable filler or combination of fillers (Component (B)) may be utilized. These<br>
may include reinforcing fillers alone or in combination with non-reinforcing fillers. Reinforcing<br>
fillers include ground silica, fumed silica, precipitated silica, silica aerogels, calcium<br>
carbonate. Non-reinforcing fillers include wollastonite, quartz, kaolin, mica, pyrophylite<br>
magnesium carbonate and other particulate inorganic solids.<br>
[0026] Component (B) may be introduced into the composition in a treated or untreated<br>
form. Treated fillers have been pre-treated with materials which provide the filler(s) with<br>
hydrophobic properties to aid in the filler/polymers mixing process. In some instances it may<br>
be beneficial to treat the fillers in situ in which case treating agent will be added to the<br>
composition of the present invention during the mixing process. Any suitable treating agent<br>
may be utilised. These may include for example one or more of the group comprising<br>
silanes, silazanes or short chain organopolysiloxane polymers. Some suitable silanes<br>
include, for example, alkyltrialkoxysilanes such as methyltriethoxysilane,<br>
methyltrimethoxysilane, phenyl trialkoxysilanes such as phenyltrimethoxysilane, or<br>
alkenyltrialkoxysilanes such as vinyltriethoxysilane, and vinyltrimethoxysilane. If desired,<br>
silazanes can also be used as treating agents for the kaolin filler, such as<br>
hexamethyldisilazane; 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisilazane; and 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisilazane.<br>
Short chain organopolysiloxanes might for example include hydroxy terminated<br>
polydimethylsiloxanes having a degree of polymerisation of from 2 to 20, hydroxy terminated<br>
polydialkyl alkylalkenylsiloxanes having a degree of polymerisation of from 2 to 20 and<br><br>
organopolysiloxanes comprising at least one Si-H group, which may or may not be a<br>
terminal group. Short chain hydroxy terminated poly3,3,3-trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes.<br>
Fluoroalkyltrialkoxysilanes and fluoroalkylsilanes may alternatively be utilised as the treating<br>
agents.<br>
[0027] Preferred fillers are reinforcing fillers such as comprise fumed silica, precipitated<br>
silica, including rice hull ash and to a degree calcium carbonate and/or kaolin. Non-<br>
reinforcing fillers such as crushed quartz, diatomaceous earths, barium sulphate, iron oxide,<br>
titanium dioxide and carbon black, talc, wollastonite may also be used. Other fillers which<br>
might be used alone or in addition to the above include aluminite, calcium sulphate<br>
(anhydrite), gypsum, calcium sulphate, magnesium carbonate, clays such as kaolin,<br>
aluminium trihydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (brucite), graphite, copper carbonate, e.g.<br>
malachite, nickel carbonate, e.g. zarachite, barium carbonate, e.g. witherite and/or strontium<br>
carbonate e.g. strontianite<br>
[0028] It is preferable that this filler have a pH below 9. Furthermore, for obtaining a<br>
sufficient reinforcement effect, the filler must have a specific surface area greater than 50<br>
m2/g. The filler amount is from 5 to 200 parts by weight, and preferably 20 to 80 parts by<br>
weight, per 100 parts by weight of component (A). If the amount of the filler exceeds 200<br>
parts by weight, the fluorosilicone rubber will lose its mechanical properties after processing<br>
and curing.<br>
[0029] Any suitable organic peroxide may be utilized as component (C), of the present<br>
invention. Some commonly used organic peroxides include benzoyl peroxide, 1,4-<br>
dichlorobenzyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide,<br>
tertiary butyl-perbenzoate, and monochlorobenzoyl peroxide, ditertiary-butyl peroxide, 2,5-<br>
bis-(tertiarybutyl-peroxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 1,1 -bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-<br>
trimethylcyclohexane, tertiary-butyl-trimethyl peroxide, tertiary-butyl-tertiary-butyl-tertiary-<br>
triphenyl peroxide, and t-butyl perbenzoate. The most suitable peroxide based curing<br>
agents are benzoyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, and dicumyl<br>
peroxide.<br>
[0030] This component may also be formed into a paste by dispersing in a silicone oil. It<br>
is recommended that component (C) be used in an amount of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 2.0 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of component (A).<br><br>
[0031] The composition may also comprise 0 to 20 parts of component (D) a second<br>
polyorganosiloxane which has a degree of polymerization greater than 1000 and the<br>
average unit formula R2bSiO(4-b)/2, in which R2 is a substituted or non-substituted monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon group which may be additionally unsaturated e.g. with alkenyl or alkynyl<br>
groups, but does not contain any fluoroinated groups. For example, when component (A) is<br>
po!y(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)methylsiloxane, our claimed composition may also be combined<br>
with optional component (D) in the form of an organopolysiloxane which has a degree of<br>
polymerization greater than 1,000 and which does not contain 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl groups.<br>
Organic groups which are bonded to silicon atoms in the polyorganosiloxane are<br>
represented by C1 to C6 alkyl groups; vinyl or allyl; and phenyl. The following are specific<br>
examples of these polyorganosiloxanes: polydimethylsiloxane, polyvinylmethylsiloxane, a<br>
copolymer of dimethylsiloxy units and methylphenylsiloxy units, and a copolymer of<br>
dimethylsiloxy units and vinyl methylsiloxy units. It is recommended that the<br>
polyorganosiloxanes be used in such an amount that, after compounding, the content of<br>
3,3,3-trifluoropropyl groups in relation to all monovalent hydrocarbon groups bonded to<br>
silicon atoms be at least 20 mole%.<br>
[0032] The essential ingredients of the fluorosilicone rubber composition of the present<br>
invention are components (A), (B), and (C) and optionally (D). If necessary, however, this<br>
composition is combined with the following additives: plasticizers such as diorganosiloxane<br>
oligomers normally used with silicone rubber compositions; metal soaps or processing aids;<br>
iron oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate or oil resistance<br>
improvers;. Other additional components may be included in the composition in accordance<br>
with the invention include chain extenders, dyes, colorants, pigments, viscosity modifiers,<br>
bath-life extenders, inhibitors, solvents, fire retardancy agents mould release agents blowing<br>
agents, flame retardants, electrically and/or thermally conductive fillers, and desiccants,<br>
handling agents, peroxide cure co-agents, acid acceptors, and UV stabilisers and<br>
flexibilisers. Suitable fire retardant agents include for example halogenated compounds,<br>
phosphates and antimony (III) oxide. Heat stabilisers such as cerium oxide and carbon<br>
black may also be used.<br>
[0033] The fluorosilicone rubber composition of the present invention may be prepared by<br>
any suitable method, such as for example uniformly mixing components (A) to (C) and (D)<br>
when present, with appropriate additives when necessary, in conventional mixing equipment<br><br>
such as a two-roll kneader-mixer. Alternatively, It is possible to premix components (A) and<br>
(B) by mixing them under heating conditions to obtain a fluorosilicone rubber base<br>
compound which is then combined with component (C).<br>
[0034] When the resulting composition is cured the applicant has found that such a cured<br>
fluorosilicone gives surprisingly improved oil resistance aging results and good adhesion to<br>
other cured siloxane rubber substrates.<br>
[0035] In one embodiment of the invention the silicone rubber is a high consistency<br>
Silicone rubber (HCR) composition having a viscosity of greater than 1000000 mPa.s at<br>
25Â°C. The silicone rubber although it may alternatively comprise a silicone modified organic<br>
rubber comprising any suitable organic rubber such as for example butyl rubber, ethylene<br>
vinyl acetate rubber, EPDM, nitrile rubber and the like.<br>
[0036] Typically a high consistency silicone rubber composition comprises an<br>
organopolysiloxane polymer (A1) having units of the general formula RaSiO4-a/2 wherein each<br>
R may be the same or different and denotes a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 18<br>
carbon atoms, a substituted hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms or a<br>
hydrocarbonoxy group having up to 18 carbon atoms. Preferably R is an optionally<br>
substituted alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group having up to 8 carbon atoms. The<br>
alkyl group can be, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl.<br>
The alkenyl group can be, for example, vinyl, allyl, propenyl, and butenyl. The aryl and<br>
aralkyl groups can be, for example, phenyl, tolyl, and benzoyl. The preferred groups are<br>
methyl, ethyl, phenyl and vinyl. Preferably at least 80% of all R groups are methyl or phenyl<br>
groups, most preferably methyl. The organopolysiloxanes are preferably those in which the<br>
value of a is 2 for practically all units, except for the terminal groups units, and the siloxanes<br>
are substantially linear polymers. The viscosity of such organopolysiloxanes may be many<br>
millions mPa.s at 25Â°C, in which case they are typically referred to as gums as they do not<br>
readily flow and as such maybe defined in terms of plasticity.<br>
[0037] Optionally the silicone rubber composition may comprise a second fluorosilicone<br>
rubber composition as described above but which is different in composition from the<br>
fluorosilicone rubber described above, i.e. not merely adhering two layers of the same<br>
composition together. The components in such a second fluorosilicone rubber composition<br>
are in accordance with (A), (B), (C) and optionally (D) above. Whereas preferably the<br><br>
second fluorosilicone rubber composition is preferably different from the composition of the<br>
first fluorosilicone rubber composition, they may be the same.<br>
[0038] Hence in a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method<br>
for the adhesion of a first layer of fluorosilicone rubber which is curable using a non-<br>
hydrosilylation curing process to a second layer of fluorosilicone and which is also curable<br>
using a non-hydrosilylation curing process, comprising the steps of:<br>
i)	incorporating either a hydrosilylation catalyst or a siloxane containing at<br>
least two silicon bonded hydrogen groups into the first fluorosilicone rubber<br>
composition prior to curing and;<br>
ii) incorporating the other of the hydrosilylation catalyst or the siloxane<br>
containing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen groups into the second<br>
fluorosilicone rubber composition prior to curing;<br>
iii) forming the products of step (i) and step (ii) into required shapes;<br>
iv) bringing the shaped products of step (iii) into contact with each other; and<br>
v) adhering the shaped products in contact with each other together by<br>
effecting a hydrosilylation reaction therebetween.<br>
[0039] It will be appreciated that the concept of the present invention will also work with<br>
respect to two layers of silicone rubber (i.e. where both are non-fluorosilicone rubbers).<br>
[0040] A high consistency rubber composition in accordance with the above typically<br>
additionally comprises a filler (B1) and a suitable catalyst (C1). Typically (B1) and (C1) are<br>
the same as components (B) and (C) described above for the fluorosilicone rubber<br>
composition. The silicone rubber composition may also comprise any of the optional<br>
additives described above with respect to the fluorosilicone rubber composition.<br>
[0041] The high consistency silicone rubber composition may be prepared by any suitable<br>
method, such as for example uniformly mixing components (A) to (C) and (D) when present,<br>
with appropriate additives when necessary, in conventional mixing equipment such as a two-<br>
roll kneader-mixer. Alternatively, It is possible to premix components (A) and (B) by mixing<br>
them under heating conditions to obtain a fluorosilicone rubber base compound which is<br>
then combined with component (C).<br><br>
[0042] It is believed that the adhesion is effected by the interaction of the siloxane<br>
containing at least two silicon -bonded hydrogen groups in one of the compositions and the<br>
hydrosilylation catalyst at the surfaces in the other composition and that the degree of<br>
adhesion is enhanced when the two compositions are brought together in the presence of<br>
heat due to migration of the aforementioned species to the surface. The inventors have<br>
found that there is no preference as to which of the compositions contain the siloxane<br>
containing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen groups (henceforth referred to as<br>
component (E) and which composition contains the hydrosilylation catalyst (henceforth<br>
referred to as component (F) providing that neither composition contains both the siloxane<br>
containing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen groups and the catalyst. Hence, when<br>
component (E) is present in the silicone rubber composition, the fluorosilicone rubber to<br>
which it is to be adhered contains component (F) and vice versa.<br>
[0043] Any suitable siloxane containing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen groups may<br>
be used as component (E) in either the fluorosilicone rubber composition or the high<br>
consistency rubber composition. The amount of hydrogen atoms bonded to silicon atoms in<br>
component (E) is 0.2 weight percent or greater, and preferably 0.4 weight percent or greater.<br>
If the amount of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms silicon-bonded atoms of component (E) is<br>
less than 0.2 weight percent, the adhesion to the substrate will be impaired.<br>
[0044] In component (E), groups other than silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms are<br>
represented by substituted or non-substituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups such as C1,<br>
C6 alkyl groups; aryl group such as phenyl; and perfluoro groups such as 3,3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl and/or 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,-nonafluorohexyl groups. Component (E) normally<br>
has a linear or cyclic molecular structure, but it can also be partially branched or three-<br>
dimensional. It is recommended that component (E) have a degree of polymerization<br>
greater than 5 and preferably within the range of 10 to 150.<br>
[0045] The following are Examples of Component (E): polymethylhydrogensiloxane; a<br>
copolymer of methylhydrogensiloxy units and dimethylsiloxy units; and a copolymer of<br>
methylhydrogensiloxy units, dimethylsiloxy units, and perfluoroalkyl (e.g. 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl<br>
and/or 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,-nonafluorohexyl groups)methylsiloxy units. Terminal groups of the<br>
molecular chain of component (E) are represented by a trimethylsiloxy group or a<br>
dimethylhydrogensiloxy group. It is recommended that the amount of component (E) be<br>
within the range of 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the silicone rubber<br><br>
polymer. Component (E) should be free of alkenyl based or acetylenic unsaturation.<br>
[0046] Preferably, component (E) when present in the high consistency silicone rubber<br>
composition does not contain any fluoro containing groups.<br>
[0047] When component (E) is present in the fluorosilicone rubber composition,<br>
component (E) may but need not contain periluoroalkyl groups. However, the presence of<br>
perfluoroalkyl groups in component (E) in the fluorosilicone rubber composition may be<br>
advantageous as the presence of such groups may make component (E) significantly more<br>
compatible with the fluorosilicone rubber composition and provides the added surprising<br>
advantage of improved aging after exposure to oil.<br>
[0048] Component (E) which optionally contains one or more fluoroalkyl groups may<br>
comprise a fluorosilicone polymer containing an average of at least two silicon-bonded<br>
hydrogen radicals per molecule<br>
[0049] Preferably component (E) additionally comprises at least 2 mol%, based on the<br>
total number of siloxane units in the fluorosilicone polymer, of fluorinated siloxane units, any<br>
remaining siloxane units in the polymer being non-fluorinated siloxane units; said fluorinated<br>
siloxane units having the formula (R"Q)(R2)X (H)eSiO(3-x-e)2 and said non-fluorinated siloxane<br>
units having the formula (R2)g(H)dSiO(4-g-d)/2 where, in said fluorinated and non-fluorinated<br>
siloxane units, R", Q are as defined above and R2 denotes a silicon-bonded, monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon radical free of aliphatic unsaturation and x = 0 to 2, e = 0 to 2, x + e = 0 to 2, g<br>
= 0 to 3, d = 0 to 3 and g + d = 0 to 3.<br>
[0050] Such a fluorosilicone based Component (E) used in the fluorosilicone rubber<br>
composition of the present invention is an organopolysiloxane consisting essentially of<br>
silicon-bonded hydrogen radicals, fluorinated siloxane units and, optionally, non-fluorinated<br>
siloxane units.<br>
[0051] In component (E) by fluorinated siloxane units, it is meant siloxane polymer units<br>
that bear a perfluoroalkyl radical suitably bonded to a silicon atom. The fluorinated siloxane<br>
units have the formula (R"Q)(R2)x(H)eSiO(3-x-e)2, general examples of which include chain-<br>
terminating siloxane units having the formula (R"Q)(R2)x(H)eSiO1/2, where the sum of x + e is<br>
2, such as (R"Q)(R)2SiO1/2, (R"Q)(H)2SiO1/2 and (R"Q)(R2)(H)SiO1/2, chain-extending<br><br>
siloxane units having the formulae (R"Q)(R2)SiO2/2 and (R"Q)(H)SiO2/2 and chain-branching<br>
siloxane units having the formula (R"Q)SiO3/2. Alternatively component C may be<br>
(R"Q)2(R2)x(H)eSiO(1-x-e)2 where x and e are both =0 to 1 and x + e = 0 to 1<br>
[0052] Each fluorinated radical, R"Q, preferably has the formula R"CH2CH2- and in the<br>
case of Component E the R" radicals need be no larger than the CF3CF2CF2CF2-.radical in<br>
order to have a fluorosilicone polymer that provides the desirable adhesion properties when<br>
cured in the composition of the present invention. Accordingly, the fluorosilicone polymers<br>
that are to be used in the curable compositions of this invention preferably contain<br>
fluorinated siloxane units delineated above whose R"Q radicals have the structure<br>
CF3CF2CF2CF2Q-, and most preferably CF3CF2CF2CH2CH2- or (CF3)2CFCH2CH2CH2-<br>
[0053] The non-fluorinated siloxane units, if present, have the formula (R"')g(H)dSiO(4-g-d)2,<br>
general examples of which include chain-terminating siloxane units having the formula<br>
(R")g(H)2SiO1/2 where the sum of g + d is 3, such as (R")3SiO1/2, (R")2(H)SiO1/2,<br>
(R")g(H)2SiO1/2 and (H)3SiO1/2, chain-extending siloxane units having the above formula<br>
where the sum of c + d is 2, such as (R')2SiO2/2, and (R"')(H)SiO2/2 and (H)2SiO2/2 and<br>
chain-branching siloxane units having the above formula where the sum of g + d is 1 or 0,<br>
such as (R"')SiO3/2, (H)SiO3/2 and SiO4/2. It is to be appreciated that each R2 and R'" may be<br>
the same groups.<br>
[0054] As previously discussed R2 denotes a silicon-bonded, monovalent hydrocarbon<br>
radical free of aliphatic unsaturation. Preferably each R2 may be the same or different and<br>
denotes a silicon-bonded monovalent hydrocarbon radical, preferably having form 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms. Examples of suitable R2 radicals include alkyl radicals, such as methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, octyl, isooctyl and decyl; aryl, such as phenyl,<br>
tolyl, benzyl, beta-phenylethyl, and styryl. Preferably at least 90 percent, and preferably all,<br>
of the R2 radicals in the fluorosilicone polymer are methyl radicals.<br>
[0055] Although component (E) can have any viscosity up to several million mPa.s (at<br>
25Â°C), it is believed necessary that the polymer not be a non-fluid, such as a gel or a solid.<br>
Therefore, said chain-branching siloxane units, if present, should be present in only minor<br>
amounts.<br><br>
[0056] Specific examples of said selected siloxane units include, but are not limited to<br>
Me3SiO1/2) Me2HSiO1/2, R"QMe2SiO1/2, R"QMeHSiO1/2, Me2SiO2/2, MeHSiO2/2, R"QMeSiO2/2<br>
and R"QHSiO2/2 where R" is, for example, perfluorobutyl.<br>
[0057] General examples of preferred component E when containing fluoro groups include,<br>
but are not limited to, the following:<br>
HMe2SiO(MeHSiO)m[R"QSi(Me)0]1SiMe2H<br>
HMe2SiO(MeHSiO)m(R"QHSiO)1SiMe2H<br>
R"QMeHSiO(MeHSiO)m(R"QHSiO),SiMeHRQ<br>
Me3SiO(Me2SiO)0.95m(MeHSiO)0.05m(R"QMeSiO)fSiMe3<br>
HMe2SiO(Me2SiO)m(R"QMeSiO)fSiMe2H<br>
HMeR"QSiO(R"QMeSiO)fSiMeR"QH<br>
Me2R"QSiO(R"QMeSiO)0.95f(R"QHiSiO)0.05fand<br>
Me3SiO(Me2SiO)m(R"QMeSiO)0.90(R"QHSiO)0.10fSiMe3<br>
wherein the viscosity of the polymer ranges from that of a freely flowing liquid to a slowly<br>
flowing gum and m and f have values of from zero to 10,000 and more.<br>
[0058] Preferably, any fluoro-containing component (E) has a linear structure with silicon<br>
bonded hydrogen radicals as represented by the formula<br>
Me3SiO(Me2SiO)r[R"CH2CH2Si(Me)O]t(MeHSiO)zSiMe3<br>
wherein the value of r is zero or greater than zero and the values of t and z are each greater<br>
than zero and are such that the fluorosilicone polymer contains from 1 to 95 mol% hydrogen<br>
bonded siloxane units, at least 5 mol% fluorinated siloxane units and the balance<br>
dimethylsiloxane units and has a viscosity of from 10 to 10000 mPa.s at 25Â°C.<br>
[0059] In the above formulae for the siloxane units, the values of x, e, g and d denote<br>
integers, the values of which are as delineated.<br>
[0060] The values of m, f, r, t and z for the linear fluorosilicone polymer denote average<br>
values, as is well known in the art, and are such that the polymer contains the requisite<br>
amount of fluorinated siloxane units and has the desired viscosity at 25Â°C. The values of m,<br>
f, m + f, r, t, z and r +t + z thus will vary greatly, depending on the fluorinated siloxane unit<br>
content, the structure of the fluorinated radicals and the viscosity of the polymer. As the mol<br><br>
percent of fluorinated siloxane units in the polymer and/or the size of the fluorinated radicals<br>
therein increases, the viscosity of the polymer increases.<br>
[0061] While the values of r, t and z can be as small as one, the values of r and t can<br>
range to 10,000 and more and the value of z typically is limited to a fraction, such as from<br>
1/100 to 2/10, of the sum of r +1 + z.<br>
[0062] Most preferably fluoro-containing component (E) is a trimethylsiloxy terminated<br>
methyl perfluoroalkyl methylhydrogen siloxane. Most preferably the perfluoroalkyl group is a<br>
perfluorobutylethyl group or the like.<br>
[0063] The amount of hydrogen atoms bonded to silicon atoms in component (E) is 0.2<br>
weight percent or greater. If the amount of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms silicon-bonded<br>
atoms of component (E) is less than 0.2 weight percent, the adhesion to the substrate will be<br>
impaired. It is recommended that the amount of component (E) be within the range of 0.01<br>
to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of component (A). If component (E) is present<br>
at less than 0.01 parts by weight, it is not possible to improve curing and adhesion<br>
properties.<br>
[0064] Hence the fluorosilicone rubber composition when comprising component (E) may<br>
comprise<br>
(A)	100 parts by weight of a polyorganosiloxane which has a degree of<br>
polymerization greater than 1000 and comprises fluorinated siloxane<br>
units, and non fluorinated siloxane units in the polymer; said fluorinated<br>
siloxane units having the formula (R"Q)a(R')b SiO(4-a-b)/2 and said non-<br>
fluorinated siloxane units having the formula (R')cSiO(4-C)/2 where, in said<br>
fluorinated and non-fluorinated siloxane units, R" denotes a branched or<br>
linear perfluoroalkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, Q denotes a<br>
divalent hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon ether or hydrocarbon thioether radical<br>
linking the R" radical to a silicon atom through at least 2 carbon atoms, R'<br>
denotes a saturated or unsaturated silicon-bonded, monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon group, wherein a = 1 to 2, b= 0 - 2 and c = 0 to 3,<br>
(B)	5 to 200 parts by weight of a suitable filler;<br><br>
(E) a fluorosilicone polymer containing an average of at least two silicon-<br>
bonded hydrogen radicals per molecule; and<br>
(C)	0.1 to 10 parts by weight of an organic peroxide.<br>
(D)	0 to 20 parts of a second polyorganosiloxane which has a degree of<br>
polymerization greater than 1000 and the average unit formula R2ySiO(4-<br>
y)/2, in which R2 is a substituted or non-substituted monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon group which may be unsaturated, but does not contain any<br>
fluoro substituents.<br>
[0065] The applicants have found that the addition of component (F) in the composition in<br>
accordance with the present invention not containing component (E) improves adhesion to<br>
the fluorosilicone polymer of the present invention, to the high consistency rubber<br>
composition. It is believed that the incorporation of the hydrosilylation catalyst causes a<br>
reaction with component (E) resulting in a significant enhancement in the adhesion of the<br>
two cured products to each other.<br>
[0066] Whilst it is preferred for the polymer containing silicon bonded hydrogen groups are<br>
present in the fluorosilicone rubber composition this is not essential and the hydrosilylation<br>
catalyst may form part of the fluorosilicone rubber composition and a suitable siloxane<br>
compound comprising silicon bonded hydrogen atoms may be provided in the high<br>
consistency silicone rubber composition.<br>
[0067] Any suitable hydrosilylation catalyst may be utilised. Preferably the hydrosilylation<br>
catalyst is a platinum group metal based catalyst selected from a platinum, rhodium, iridium,<br>
palladium or ruthenium catalyst. Platinum group metal containing catalysts useful to<br>
catalyse curing of the present compositions can be any of those known to catalyse reactions<br>
of silicon bonded hydrogen atoms with silicon bonded alkenyl groups. The preferred<br>
platinum group metal for use as a catalyst to effect cure of the present compositions by<br>
hydrosilylation is platinum. Some preferred platinum based hydrosilylation catalysts for<br>
curing the present composition are platinum metal, platinum compounds and platinum<br>
complexes. Representative platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, chloroplatinic<br>
acid hexahydrate, platinum dichloride, and complexes of such compounds containing low<br><br>
molecular weight vinyl containing organosiloxanes. Other hydrosilylation catalysts suitable<br>
for use in the present invention include for example rhodium catalysts such as<br><br>
HaRhbolefincCld, Rh (O(CO)R3)3-n(OH)n where X is hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or iodine, Y is<br>
an alkyl group, such as methyl or ethyl, CO, C8H14 or 0.5 C8H12 R3 is an alkyl radical,<br>
cycloalkyl radical or aryl radical and R2 is an alkyl radical an aryl radical or an oxygen<br>
substituted radical, a is 0 or 1, b is 1 or 2, c is a whole number from 1 to 4 inclusive and d is<br>
2,3 or 4, n is 0 or 1. Any suitable iridium catalysts such as lr(OOCCH3)3, lr(C5H7O2)3,<br>
[lr(Z)(En)2]2. or (lr(Z)(Dien)]2, where Z is chlorine, bromine, iodine, or alkoxy, En is an olefin<br>
and Dien is cyclooctadiene may also be used.<br>
[0068] Component (F) may be added to the present composition in an amount equivalent<br>
to as little as 0.001 part by weight of elemental platinum group metal, per one million parts of<br>
the composition. Preferably, the concentration of platinum group metal in the composition is<br>
that capable of providing the equivalent of at least 1 part per million of elemental platinum<br>
group metal. A catalyst concentration providing the equivalent of about 3-50 parts per<br>
million of elemental platinum group metal is generally the amount preferred.<br>
[0069] The present application is of use for any purpose requiring adhesion between the<br>
two layers above and for fluorosilicone rubber compositions to be used in situations where<br>
improved oil resistance properties are required. One application which relates to both of<br>
these potential applications is in the preparation of parts for automobiles such as<br>
turbocharger hoses. A typical turbocharger hose is depicted in Fig.1. In figure 1 there is<br>
provided a turbocharger hose (1) having an inner fluorosilicone liner (2), a high consistency<br>
silicone rubber inner layer (3), a reinforcing layer (4), typically made from a suitable<br>
reinforcing fabric such as aramid or the like and a high consistency silicone rubber outer<br>
layer (5).<br>
[0070] The present invention will now be described with respect to the Figure and with the<br>
aid of examples:-	<br><br>

composition of 1,3,-diethenyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane complexes of platinum.<br>
SAMPLE PREPARATION<br>
[0074] Unless described to the contrary, all samples used in the adhesion tests described<br>
in the Examples below were made using the following process:-<br>
[0075] Uncured slabs having dimensions of 150 x 150 x 2 mm of fluorosilicone rubber and<br>
high consistency rubber were pressed out. These were then coupled together whilst<br>
inserting a PET sheet between the layers at one end to allow separation after cure. The<br>
coupled sheets were then cured in a 4mm deep mould for 20minutes at 170 Â°C. 10mm<br>
strips were then cut using a suitable cutting tool and the resulting test samples were<br>
analysed for the level of adhesion between the two layers.<br>
THE ADHESION TEST<br>
[0076] Samples prepared in Examples 1 to 4 were subjected to a 180Â° peel test using a<br>
Lloyd tensiometer at a crosshead speed of 50mm min-1.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0077] In this example uncured and pre-shaped fluorosilicone rubber (FSR) and high<br>
consistency rubber (HCR) samples were combined together before curing using the above<br>
sample preparation process such that the samples of each compound were cured and<br>
adhered to each other in accordance to one embodiment of the invention simultaneously.<br>
The cross-linker used was 1% by weight of the composition weight of<br>
methyl(perfluorobutylethyl), methyl hydrogen siloxane having a viscosity of about 35 mPa.s<br>
at 25Â°C. When present, the cross-linker was added to the fluorosilicone rubber composition<br>
and the platinum catalyst was incorporated into the high consistency rubber composition.<br><br><br>
[0078] It will be seen in Table 1 that the adhesion of all samples containing the cross-<br>
linker in the fluorosilicone layer gave significantly higher peel force test results with those in<br>
contact with high consistency rubber layers containing a platinum catalyst being significantly<br>
better than when the platinum catalyst was omitted.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0079] Exactly the same processes were undertaken to prepare and measure samples as<br>
described above. The only difference in this example was the use of an alternative cross-<br>
linker, referred to in Table 2 as FSR cross-linker (2). FSR cross-linker (2) was a<br>
dimethylhydrogensiloxy terminated trifluoropropyl silsesquioxane having a viscosity of about<br>
5 mPa.s at 25Â°C.<br><br><br>
[0080] Again as seen in Table 1, it will be seen in Table 2 that the adhesion in all samples<br>
containing the cross-linker in the fluorosilicone layer gave significantly higher peel force test<br>
results with those in contact with high consistency rubber layers containing a platinum<br>
catalyst being significantly better than when the platinum catalyst was omitted.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The results clearly show improved adhesion in the presence of crosslinker 3<br>
[0081] Exactly the same processes were undertaken to prepare and measure samples as<br>
described above. The only difference in this example was the use of an alternative cross-<br>
linker, referred to in Table 3 as cross-linker (3). Cross-linker (3) was a trimethylsiloxy<br>
terminated polymethylhydrogen siloxane having a viscosity of about 30 mPa.s at 25Â°C.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0082] Exactly the same processes were undertaken to prepare and measure samples as<br>
described above. The only difference in this example was the use of an alternative cross-<br>
linker, referred to in Table 3 as cross-linker (3). Cross-linker (3) was a trimethylsiloxy<br>
terminated polymethylhydrogen siloxane having a viscosity of about 30 mPa.s at 25Â°C with<br>
the crosslinker being added to the high consistency silicone rubber (HCR) composition and<br>
the Pt catalyst being added to the fluorosilicone rubber composition (FSR).<br><br>
[0083] The results clearly show improved adhesion in the presence of crosslinker 3<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0084] In this example samples were prepared as described above and the adhesion test<br>
used was the same but the platinum catalyst was incorporated into the fluorosilicone rubber<br>
composition and 1% by weight of a suitable HCR cross-linker, namely trimethyl terminated<br>
methyl hydrogen methyloctyl siloxane having a viscosity of about 50mPa.s, was<br>
incorporated into the high consistency rubber composition.<br><br><br>
[0085] Although the difference in adhesion results are not as great there is again a<br>
significant improvement in the peel force where the cross-linker and catalyst are both used.<br>
Again as seen in both Tables 1 and 2, it will be seen in Table 5 that samples containing the<br>
catalyst in the fluorosilicone layer and cross-linker in the high consistency rubber layer gave<br>
significantly higher peel force test results than samples in which both catalyst and cross-<br>
linker were omitted.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0086] In this example the sample preparation was altered in that a portion of<br>
fluorosilicone rubber 2, optionally with added platinum or crosslinker, was cured in a mould<br>
to give 2mm thick sheets. A second portion of fluorosilicone rubber 2, optionally with added<br>
crosslinker or platinum, was formed into an uncured slab as described above. The cured<br>
and uncured sheets were then pressed together under a pressure of 100 bar (107 Pa) at<br>
170Â°C for 10 minutes. The same peel test as previously described was then carried out to<br>
assess the relative adhesion of the sheets to each other, the results being provided in Table<br>
6 below.<br><br><br>
[0087] The results show that the combination of platinum catalyst in the pre-cured FSR<br>
sheet with fluorocrosslinker in the uncured sheet gives a significant improvement in adhesion<br>
compared to the absence of one or both of crosslinker and catalyst or to the case where the<br>
fluoro crosslinker is in the pre-cured layer and the platinum catalyst in the uncured layer.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br><br>
[0089] In this no enhancement in adhesion was observed (in fact a decrease occurred).<br>
[0088] In this example the sample preparation was altered in that the fluorosilicone rubber<br>
and high consistency rubber slabs were individually cured in moulds to give 2mm thick<br>
sheets. The sheets were then pressed together under a pressure of 100 bar at 170Â°C for 20<br>
minutes. The same peel test as previously described was then carried out to assess the<br>
relative adhesion of the sheets to each other, the results being provided in Table 7 below.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0090] In this example the physical properties of samples of the fluorosilicone rubber<br>
containing a cross-linker in the form of 1% by weight of FSR cross-linker 1 were compared<br>
with samples prepared in the absence of FSR cross-linker 1 with respect to the physical<br>
properties of the cured fluorosilicone rubber both before and after aging in an oil for 7 days in<br>
accordance with ASTM D471-95.<br>
[0091] Samples of the fluorosilicone rubber were prepared as described above. A series<br>
of test samples were used to assess the initial physical properties of the cured fluorosilicone<br>
rubbers and other samples were immersed in oil (Total MA-3 pre aged 16h @ 150 Â°C) for 7<br>
days at 175Â°C. After aging the samples were cleaned and tested to determine the relative<br>
change in physical properties after aging in oil. Results are provided below in Table 8. All<br>
the physical tests undertaken used the same methods as indicated below:<br>
[0092] It will be noted that the elongation at break after aging FSR composition 3 is<br>
improved by the addition of cross-linker 1 and improvements were also seen in tensile<br>
strength.<br><br><br><br><br>
