The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of the well known antidepressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fiuorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile and intermediates used in the method.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well known antidepressant drug that has now been on the marked for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally active serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. &amp; Biol Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75 , 478-486. The compound has further been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A 474580.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,27! corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram and outlines a further method which may be used for preparing citalopram.<br>
According to the process described, the corresponding l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is reacted with 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-ch]oride in the presence of methylsulfmylmethide as condensing agent. The starting material was prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide.<br>
According to the method, which is only outlined in general terms, citalopram may be obtained by ring closure of the compound:<br><br><br>
is subjected to a ring-closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid in order to obtain citalopram. The intermediate of Formula III was prepared from 5-cyanophthahde by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium halogenide and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively.<br>
Finally, methods of preparing the individual enantiomers of citalopram are disclosed in US Patent No 4,943,590 from which it also appears that the ring closure of the intermediate of Formula III may be carried out in basic conditions.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that citalopram may be manufactured by a favourable and safe procedure using convenient starting materials.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of citalopram comprising the steps of reacting a compound of Formula IV<br><br><br><br><br>
where R1 and X are as defined above, to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative, i.e. citalopram, which is isolated as the base or a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides the novel intermediates of Formulas IVa and V, respectively.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the novel intermediates of Formula VI.<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention relates to an antidepressant pharmaceutical composition comprising citalopram manufactured by the process of the invention.<br>
Throughout the specification and Claims, C,_s alkyi refers to a branched or unbranched alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-l-ethyl and 2-methyJ-l -propyl.<br>
Grignard reagents of 4-halogen-fluorophenyl that may be used in the first step are the magnesium halogenides, such as the chloride, bromide or iodide. Preferably the magnesium bromide is used. Grignard reagents of 3-halogen-N,N-dimethylpropylamine that may be used are the magnesium halogenides, such as the chloride, bromide or iodide, preferably the magnesium bromide. The intermediate of Formula IVa may or may not be isolated. Preferably the two reactions are performed successively without isolation of the intermediate.<br>
The ring-closure of the compound of Formula V is effected by an acid or via a labile ester with a base. Acidic ring closure is performed by an inorganic acid, such as a sulfuric or phosphoric acid, or an organic acid, such as methyisulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic or J trifluoroacetic acid. The basic ringclosure is performed via a labile ester, such as the methane sulfonyl, p-toluene sulfonyl, 10-camphorsulfonyl, trifluoro acetyl or trifluoromefhanesulfonyl ester with addition of a base, such as triethyl amine, dimethyianiline, pyridine, etc. The reaction is performed in an inert solvent, preferably with<br><br>
cooling, in particular about 0 Â°C and is preferably carried out by a one-pot procedure, i.e. with esterification and simultaneous addition of the base.<br>
When X is O, the conversion of the group R'-X-CO- to cyano is preferably performed via the corresponding amide group which is then converted to the cyano group in the same way as compounds of Formula VI wherein X is NH.<br>
The reaction of R'-X-CO- (X=0) to amide is carried out by hydrolysis with an acid or a base and subsequent conversion to acid chloride and amidation by reaction with ammonia or an alkylamine, preferably t-butyl amine. Acid hydrolysis may be performed by use of any suitable acid, such as HBr, HC1, HBr/acetic acid. Basic hydrolysis may be performed with J any suitable base, such as K2C03, NaOH, KOH, etc. The conversion to amide may also be obtained by reaction of the ester (X=0) with ammonia or an alkylamine under pressure and heating.<br>
The amide is converted to the cyano group by conventional nitril synthesis. So, the resulting amide or the amide of Formula V wherein X is NH is preferably converted to the cyano compound, i.e. citalopram, by reaction with a dehydrating agent, most preferably thionyl chloride, phosphor pentachloride, etc.<br>
Alternatively, an ester, i.e. a compound of Formula VI wherein X is O may be hydrolysed/ and then reacted with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in order to form the nitrile.<br>
The process of the invention may be carried out with or without isolation of the intermediates.<br>
The process of the invention may also be used to prepare the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram. In that case, the compound of formula V is separated into the optically active enanfiomers by a procedure analogous to the one described in US Patent No 4,943,590 thereby obtaining the (S)-enantiomer of the compound of formula V which is used in the ring closure reaction in step c). Accordingly, the individual enantiomers of the intermediates of formulas V and VI, respectively, are embraced by the formulas.<br>
Other reaction conditions, solvents, etc. are conventional conditions for such reactions and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The starting materials of formula IV are commercially available or may be prepared from 5-carboxyphtalide by reaction with thionyl chloride and then C,_s alkanol or C,^ alkylamine.<br><br>
5-carboxyphtalide is commercially available and may be prepared by well known procedures (Tiroufiet, J.; BulI.Soc.Sci. Bretagne 26, 1959,35).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention X is O and R1 is ethyl, propyl, or butyl, preferably ethyl, 2-propyl or t-butyl.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention X is NH and R1 is ethyl, propyl, or butyl, preferably ethyl, 2-propyl or t-butyl, most preferably t-butyl.<br>
The compound of general Formula I may be used as the free base or as a pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. As acid addition salts such salts formed with organic or inorganic acids may be used. Exemplary of such organic salts are those with maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, oxalic, bis-methylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, mandelic, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p-amino-benzoic, glutamic, benzene sulfonic and theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines, for example 8-bromotheophylline. Exemplary of such inorganic salts are those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds may be prepared by methods known in the art. The base is reacted with either the calculated amount of acid in a water miscible solvent, such as acetone or ethanol, with subsequent isolation of the salt by concentration and cooling, or with an excess of the acid in a water immiscible solvent, such as ethylether, ethylacetate or dichloromethane, with the salt separating spontaneously.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in any suitable way and in any suitable form, for example orally in the form of tablets, capsules, powders or syrups, or parenterally in the form of usual sterile solutions for injection.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting maschine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Corn starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other i adjuvant or additive colourings, aroma, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients.<br><br>
Solutions for injections may be prepared by solving the active ingredient and possible additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to the desired volume, sterilisation of the solution and filling in suitable ampoules or vials. Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity aeents, preservatives, antioxidants, etc.<br>
