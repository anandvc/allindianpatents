Description<br>
Insulator unit<br>
The invention relates to an insulator unit, which is suitable<br>
for example for supporting or mechanically holding electrically<br>
live objects, e.g. busbars, isolating switches or smoothing<br>
chokes.<br>
The use of individual free-standing insulators - so-called<br>
supporting insulators - for supporting electrically live<br>
objects is generally known.<br>
There is currently a demand for energy transmission systems and<br>
switchgear systems, which work with very high DC or AC<br>
voltages. Here, the development is tending towards so-called<br>
UHV-DC switchgear systems, for example (UHV-DC = Ultra High<br>
Voltage Direct Current). When very high voltages are used,<br>
special requirements are placed on the insulator units. In<br>
particular, there are very high requirements with regard to the<br>
necessary clearance distances and creepage distances. These<br>
requirements cannot be fulfilled with individual free-standing<br>
insulators. It can be seen, for example, from the International<br>
Standard IEC 62231, First edition 2006-02, "Composite station<br>
post insulators for substations with a.c. voltages greater than<br>
1000 V up to 245 kV - Definitions, test methods and acceptance<br>
criteria", which is today applicable to solid-core composite<br>
insulators, that such individual solid-core composite<br>
insulators are only used for voltages up to 245 kV.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying an insulator<br>
unit, which can be used with very high voltages.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by an<br>
insulator unit with at least three supporting insulators, which<br>
each have a column-shaped core made from solid material, a foot<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 2 -<br>
section and a head section, the foot sections being<br>
mechanically rigidly connected to one another and the head<br>
sections being mechanically rigidly connected to one another.<br>
At the same time, it is particularly advantageous that the at<br>
least three supporting insulators (more than three supporting<br>
insulators can also be used, for example four, five or six) are<br>
mechanically rigidly connected to one another. Advantageously,<br>
a very high stiffness and mechanical loading capability of the<br>
insulating unit is achieved as a result of the mechanically<br>
rigid connection (rigid coupling) of the at least three<br>
supporting insulators. This enables this insulator unit to be<br>
realized with very large mechanical dimensions, in particular<br>
with very large heights. Large clearance distances and long<br>
creepage distances can thus be realized, as a result of which<br>
such insulator units can also be used for very high voltages.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous that supporting insulators are<br>
used, which each have a column-shaped core made a solid<br>
material. Such supporting insulators are also called solid-core<br>
supporting insulators. With supporting insulators of this kind,<br>
which are available as inexpensive components, such an<br>
insulating unit, which with regard to its dimensions has a<br>
great height and can be used with very high voltages, can be<br>
realized with high stiffness and mechanical loading capability<br>
easily and cost effectively.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the insulating unit are specified<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the column-shaped<br>
cores of the supporting insulators are arranged parallel to one<br>
another. This results in a compact insulator unit with regard<br>
to its external dimensions.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the foot sections<br>
are mechanically rigidly connected to one another by means of a<br>
plate to which the foot sections are fixed.<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 3 -<br>
At the same time, the foot sections can be fixed to the plate<br>
by means of screw fasteners.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the head sections<br>
are mechanically rigidly connected to one another by means of a<br>
plate to which the head sections are fixed.<br>
At the same time, the head sections can be fixed to the plate<br>
by means of screw fasteners.<br>
The mechanically rigid connection of the foot sections to one<br>
another and of the head sections to one another by means of a<br>
plate and by means of screw fasteners advantageously allows the<br>
supporting insulators to be mechanically connected to one<br>
another easily and cost effectively. Furthermore,<br>
advantageously, the screw fasteners can be released again, e.g.<br>
in the case of a repair, in order to replace individual<br>
supporting insulators of the insulator unit.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the plate connecting<br>
the head sections (of the at least three supporting insulators)<br>
simultaneously connects the foot sections of at least three<br>
further supporting insulators rigidly to one another, the three<br>
further supporting insulators being aligned in the same<br>
direction as the at least three supporting insulators. As the<br>
plate connecting the head sections simultaneously connects the<br>
foot sections of at least three further supporting insulators<br>
rigidly to one another, this insulating unit advantageously has<br>
an electrical series circuit in which the at least three<br>
supporting insulators, the head sections of which are rigidly<br>
connected to one another by means of the plate, are connected<br>
electrically in series with the three further supporting<br>
insulators, the foot sections of which are rigidly connected to<br>
one another by means of the same plate. The withstand voltage<br>
of the insulator unit can be still further increased by this<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 4 -<br>
electrical series circuit, as a result of which the insulator<br>
unit can be used with very high voltages.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the plate connecting<br>
the foot sections (of the at least three supporting insulators)<br>
simultaneously connects the head sections of at least three<br>
additional supporting insulators rigidly to one another, the<br>
three additional supporting insulators being aligned in the<br>
same direction as the at least three supporting insulators. As<br>
the plate connecting the foot sections of the at least three<br>
supporting insulators simultaneously connects the head sections<br>
of the at least three additional supporting insulators rigidly<br>
to one another, this insulating unit advantageously has an<br>
electrical series circuit in which the at least three<br>
supporting insulators, which are rigidly connected to one<br>
another, are connected in series with the three additional<br>
supporting insulators, the head sections of which are rigidly<br>
connected to one another by means of the plate. By this means,<br>
the withstand voltage of the insulator unit can be still<br>
further increased compared with an insulator unit, which<br>
consists only of the at least three supporting insulators,<br>
which are rigidly connected to one another.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the foot section<br>
and/or the head section of the supporting insulators is<br>
constructed as an end fitting fixed to the core in each case.<br>
By means of such an end fitting (for example, made from steel),<br>
the supporting insulators can easily be rigidly connected to<br>
one another.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that the cores of the<br>
supporting insulators are made of glass fiber reinforced<br>
plastic. Supporting insulators with cores made of glass fiber<br>
reinforced plastic enable insulator units with high stiffness<br>
and large mechanical loading capability to be realized with a<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 5 -<br>
relatively low mass (compared with other supporting insulators,<br>
for example insulators made from porcelain).<br>
The insulator unit can be realized so that the cores are each<br>
provided with shields.<br>
At the same time, the shields can have a water-repellent<br>
surface. Such shields can be realized in a particularly easy<br>
and cost-effective manner in the case of supporting insulators,<br>
which have cores made from glass fiber reinforced plastic. For<br>
example, such shields can be shrunk onto the glass fiber<br>
reinforced plastic core, as result of which, for example, the<br>
production of expensive casting molds for casting a supporting<br>
insulator with shields is avoided.<br>
Advantageously, the insulator unit can be designed so that it<br>
has a height of at least 10 meters and/or that it has a rated<br>
withstand voltage of 800 kilovolts for DC. Advantageously, as a<br>
result of the mechanically rigid connection of at least three<br>
supporting insulators, which have a core made from solid<br>
material, an insulating unit can be realized, which is<br>
mechanically very stable, in particular which has a high<br>
stiffness and loading capability. Advantageously, as a result,<br>
it is possible to realize an insulator unit, which has a height<br>
of 10 m and above. Advantageously, very high voltages can be<br>
insulated by means of such insulator units, e.g. voltages of<br>
800 kV and above.<br>
The insulator unit can be designed so that it is arranged to<br>
support busbars, smoothing chokes and/or isolating switches. In<br>
this way, this insulator unit can be used with advantage in so-<br>
called Ultra High Voltage Direct Current high voltage DC<br>
transmission systems.<br>
The insulator unit can also be realized so that it has a column<br>
shape.<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 6 -<br>
To explain the invention further, an exemplary embodiment of an<br>
insulator unit is explained in more detail below with reference<br>
to a drawing.<br>
The single figure shows an insulator unit 1, which comprises<br>
nine supporting insulators 2 to 10. Each of the supporting<br>
insulators has a column-shaped (cylindrical) core made from<br>
solid material (insulator core), which in the exemplary<br>
embodiment is made of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP).<br>
This core made from solid material is enclosed by a silicone<br>
sleeve to which a plurality of shields 11, 12, 13 etc. is<br>
fixed. The nine supporting insulators 2 to 10 therefore<br>
constitute solid core composite insulators in which a composite<br>
material comprising glass fiber reinforced plastic and silicone<br>
is present. The shields 11, 12, 13 have a water-repellent<br>
(hydrophobic) shield surface. Each of the supporting insulators<br>
has a foot section (foot-end flange, foot-end end fitting) and<br>
a head section (head-end flange, head-end end fitting). Hence,<br>
for example, the supporting insulator 2 has a foot section 16<br>
and a head section 20; the supporting insulator 3 has a foot<br>
section 17 and a head section 21, and the supporting insulator<br>
4 has a foot section 18 and a head section 22. These foot<br>
sections 16, 17, 18 and/or the head sections 20, 21, 22 can<br>
each be constructed as an end fitting, which is fixed to the<br>
solid material core. Such an end fitting can, for example, be<br>
made of steel and have holes through which screws are placed,<br>
which serve to provide a mechanically rigid connection, and by<br>
means of which the respective foot and head section can be<br>
screwed to plates.<br>
The column-shaped cores of the three supporting insulators 2, 3<br>
and 4 are arranged parallel to one another, i.e. the axes of<br>
the essentially rotationally symmetrical cores (which also form<br>
the axes of the essentially rotationally symmetrical supporting<br>
insulators) run parallel to one another. Likewise, the column-<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 7 -<br>
shaped cores of the three further supporting insulators 5, 6<br>
and 7 are arranged parallel to one another, and the cores of<br>
the three additional supporting insulators 8, 9 and 10 are<br>
arranged parallel to one another. The axes of all cores point<br>
in the same direction.<br>
The three supporting insulators 2, 3 and 4 are mechanically<br>
rigidly connected to one another. This is achieved in that the<br>
three foot sections 16, 17 and 18 are rigidly connected to one<br>
another, and that the head sections 20, 21 and 22 are rigidly<br>
connected to one another. The mechanically rigid connection of<br>
the foot sections to one another is realized in that the foot<br>
sections 16, 17 and 18 are fixed to a plate 25 by means of<br>
screw fasteners. The head sections 20, 21 and 22 are<br>
mechanically rigidly connected to one another in that these<br>
head sections are fixed to a plate 27 by means of screw<br>
fasteners.<br>
At the same time, the plate 27, which connects the head<br>
sections 20, 21 and 22 of the supporting insulators 2, 3 and 4,<br>
connects foot sections 30, 31 and 32 of the further supporting<br>
insulators 5, 6 and 7 rigidly to one another (in the figure,<br>
the foot section 31 is hidden by the plate 27) . In the same<br>
way, the foot sections 16, 17 and 18 of the supporting<br>
insulators 2, 3 and 4 are rigidly connected to one another by<br>
means of the plate 25, the plate 25 at the same time connecting<br>
head sections 35, 36 and 37 of the three additional supporting<br>
insulators 8, 9 and 10 rigidly to one another. Foot sections<br>
38, 39 and 40 of the supporting insulators 8, 9 and 10 are<br>
rigidly connected to one another by means of a plate 43. This<br>
plate 43 forms a first (bottom) end of the insulator unit 1.<br>
Head sections 46, 47 and 48 of the supporting insulators 5, 6<br>
and 7 are rigidly connected to one another by means of a plate<br>
50. This plate 50 forms a second (top) end of the insulator<br>
unit 1.<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 8 -<br>
The insulator unit 1 has a column shape. The insulator unit 1<br>
has a height of ca. 10 m measured from the plate 43 to the<br>
plate 50. From an electrical point of view, the supporting<br>
insulators 5, 6 and 7 are electrically connected in parallel by<br>
the plates 27 and 50. In the same way, the supporting<br>
insulators 2, 3 and 4 are electrically connected in parallel by<br>
the plates 25 and 27. The supporting insulators 8, 9 and 10 are<br>
electrically connected in parallel by the plates 43 and 25. In<br>
addition, from an electrical point of view, the insulator unit<br>
also has a series circuit: the three supporting insulators 5, 6<br>
and 7, which are electrically connected in parallel, are<br>
electrically connected in series with the three supporting<br>
insulators 2, 3 and 4 (which are electrically connected in<br>
parallel) and with the three supporting insulators 8, 9 and 10<br>
(which are electrically connected in parallel).<br>
Due to the mechanically rigid connection of the supporting<br>
insulators to one another at the plates 43, 25, 27 and 50,<br>
which is realized by means of screw fasteners, an insulator<br>
unit is realized, which is very stiff and can be subjected to a<br>
high mechanical load.<br>
The plates 43 and 50 are so-called "end plates", because they<br>
each form an end of the column-shaped insulator unit 1. At the<br>
same time, the plates 25 and 27 constitute so-called<br>
"intermediate plates", because the supporting insulators are<br>
screwed to both sides of the plates 25 and 27, and these plates<br>
25 and 27 are therefore effectively located "between supporting<br>
insulators". As a result of these intermediate plates 25 and<br>
27, the strength and mechanical loading capability of the<br>
insulator unit is further increased compared with an insulator<br>
unit, which has no intermediate plates but only end plates<br>
similar to the plates 43 and 50 shown in the figure.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, which is not shown in the<br>
figure, an insulator unit can also consist only of the three<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 9 -<br>
supporting insulators 2, 3 and 4 and the two plates 25 and 27.<br>
Such an insulator unit would then only have three supporting<br>
insulators and no intermediate plates; the two plates 25 and 27<br>
would then be end plates. Because the supporting insulators 2,<br>
3 and 4 are rigidly screwed to one another, an insulator unit<br>
designed in such a way could also be highly loaded<br>
mechanically, would be very stiff and would have a high<br>
strength. As a result, such an insulator unit could also be<br>
realized with a great height, as a result of which a high<br>
withstand voltage would likewise be achieved.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment, which is not shown in the<br>
figure, can be realized so that the foot sections and the head<br>
sections of more than three supporting insulators are each<br>
mechanically rigidly connected to one another. For example, not<br>
only three supporting insulators (namely the supporting<br>
insulators 2, 3 and 4) but for example also four, five or six<br>
supporting insulators can be arranged between the plates 25 and<br>
27, the foot sections of these four, five or six supporting<br>
insulators being fixed by means of screw fasteners to the plate<br>
25 (screwed to the plate 25) and the head sections of these<br>
four, five or six supporting insulators being fixed by means of<br>
screw fasteners to the plate 27 (screwed to the plate 27). In<br>
the same way, for example, four, five or six supporting<br>
insulators can also be arranged between the plates 43 and 25<br>
and between the plates 27 and 50 in each case and rigidly<br>
connected to one another.<br>
An insulator unit with supporting insulators, which have a core<br>
made from solid material, in particular a core made from glass<br>
fiber reinforced plastic, has a series of advantages. Such<br>
supporting insulators are components, which are inexpensive to<br>
buy and which - in comparison with porcelain insulators for<br>
example - have comparatively low mass. With such supporting<br>
insulators, the shield shape and the shield pitch (i.e. the<br>
arrangement and distance of the shields) can be chosen<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 10 -<br>
relatively freely, because the shields can be fixed to the core<br>
easily and cost effectively by means of a shrink-on process. In<br>
particular, it is not necessary to produce expensive (e.g.<br>
customer-specific) casting molds for this purpose. Furthermore,<br>
the shields and a silicone sleeve, which encloses the core, can<br>
be made from ATH-filled HTV silicone (aluminum-trihydrate-<br>
filled high-temperature-vulcanized silicone). On the other<br>
hand, the use of such a silicone would not be possible in the<br>
case of molded insulators.<br>
Furthermore, supporting insulators with solid material core, in<br>
particular with cores made from glass fiber reinforced plastic,<br>
have the advantage that they are flexible or elastic so that<br>
any manufacturing tolerances or inaccuracies that may occur do<br>
not lead to problems with the rigid mechanical coupling of the<br>
supporting insulators. The flexibility or elasticity prevents<br>
breaking of the insulators - this is an advantage compared with<br>
porcelain insulators for example. In addition, for the same DC<br>
withstand voltage, an insulator unit with about 25% less height<br>
is sufficient - compared with an insulator unit made up of<br>
porcelain insulators - when shields with a water-repellent<br>
surface are used. This is a considerable advantage. Compared<br>
with an insulator unit made from porcelain insulators, this<br>
gives rise to a significantly lower mass, as a result of which<br>
such an insulator unit (with supporting insulators with solid<br>
material core) can also be safely used under extreme<br>
conditions, for example in the case of earthquakes.<br>
Due to the rigid connection of the individual supporting<br>
insulators and the resulting high strength, stiffness and<br>
mechanical loading capability of the insulator unit, the<br>
insulator unit only moves slightly at the top end (at the so-<br>
called head, i.e. at the plate 50 of the insulator unit in the<br>
exemplary embodiment) even in the case of strong wind, for<br>
example, i.e. only a small deflection of the top end of the<br>
insulator unit occurs.<br><br>
2006P22544 IN	- 11 -<br>
Such insulator units can therefore be used with advantage, for<br>
example, in regions at risk of earthquake, with high wind<br>
loading, with high connecting forces of a busbar supported by<br>
the insulator unit or when only small deflections are- permitted<br>
at the head of the insulator unit. As a result, the faulty<br>
operation of an isolating switch arranged on the insulator unit<br>
or possible deformation of busbars arranged on the insulator<br>
unit can be prevented, for example.<br>
Because of the use of supporting insulators with solid material<br>
core, further advantages of the insulator unit consist in the<br>
fact that no potential control problems and boundary layer<br>
problems occur inside the insulator core, that only extremely<br>
low amounts of moisture can penetrate into the core, and that<br>
(because of the non-existence of cavities in the core) no<br>
filler media and no devices for monitoring cavities (of a<br>
hollow-bodied insulator) are necessary.<br>
An insulator unit has been described, which consists of several<br>
supporting insulators rigidly connected to one another, which<br>
have a core consisting of a solid material. This insulator unit<br>
has a high strength, stiffness and mechanical loading<br>
capability. As a result of this, this insulator unit can be<br>
realized with heights of 10 m and higher, as result of which<br>
high withstand voltages (e.g. of 800 kV DC rated voltage and<br>
above) can be achieved. In particular, the insulator unit can<br>
be used with voltages higher than 245 kV and therefore clearly<br>
exceeds the limitations specified in the standard IEC 62231.<br>
The insulator unit is suitable for supporting a wide range of<br>
electrically live objects, for example for supporting busbars,<br>
smoothing chokes and/or isolating switches. As a result, the<br>
insulator unit is particularly suitable for use with ultra high<br>
direct voltage (UHV DC - ultra high voltage direct current),<br>
such as occurs in high voltage direct current transmission<br>
systems, for example. This insulator unit enables the clearance<br><br>

distance and creepage distance requirements that occur here to<br>
be fulfilled by choosing an appropriately large overall height<br>
of the insulator unit.<br><br>
