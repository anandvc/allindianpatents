DESCRIPTION METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR<br>
TREATING CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and composition<br>
for  treating  a  central  nervous  system disorder  in  a<br>
mammalian subject.  The invention also relates to a novel<br>
prostaglandin compound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Intercellular junctions mediate adhesion and communication between adjoining endothelial and epithelial cells. In the endothelium, junctional complexes comprise tight junctions, adherens junctions, and gap junctions. The expression and organization of these complexes depend on the type of vessels and the permeability requirements of perfused organs.' Gap junctions are communication structures, which allow the passage of small molecular weight solutes between neighboring cells. Tight junctions serve the major functional purpose of providing a "barrier" and a "fence" within the membrane, by regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining cell polarity. Adherens junctions play an important role in contact inhibition of endothelial cell growth, paracellular permeability to circulating leukocytes and solutes.   In<br><br><br>
The mechanism by which epithelial and endothelial cells interact to form polarized tissue is of fundamental importance to multicellular organisms. Dysregulation of these barriers occurs in a variety of diseases, destroying the normal cellular environments and leading to organ failure.<br>
Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) have tight junctions that are critical for maintaining brain homeostasis and low permeability.<br>
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized structure in the central nervous system (CNS), which participates in maintenance of a state of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis by controlling the access of nutrients and toxic substances to the central nervous system (CNS).<br>
The base membrane underlying the vasculature plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity, of the BBB by providing structural support to the endothelial cell wall (Trends Neurosci. 1990;13(5): 174-178). The BBB serves to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from invasive agents, such as inflammatory cells and bacteria, as well as from chemical agents.<br><br><br>
Examples of the disorders include multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, bacterial meningitis, ischemia, brain edema, Alzheimer1s disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia complex (Helga E. DE Vries et al, Pharmacological Reviews, 49(2): 143-155, 1997), brain tumors (Davies D. C. et al. , J Anat., 200 (6): 639-46,2002), traumatic brain injury (Hartl R et. al., Acta Neurochir Suppl. 70: 240-242, 1997).<br>
It has also been reported that, after focal stroke, there is a breakdown of the BBB with an associated increase in vascular permeability. Damage to the BBB often results in hemorrhage and edema, resulting in neuronal cell death (Biomedicine. 1974;21:36-39, Stroke, 1998; 29(5): 1020-1030, Stroke, 2003; 34(3):8 06-812, J Neurotrauma. 1995;12:8 33-842) . Brain injury after focal stroke is primarily a result of the decrease in blood flow and of energy depletion due to occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel. The neuronal tissue becomes infracted as • a result of these events, with contributions from excitotoxicity, enzyme activation, edema, and inflammation (Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1996;17:227-233, Crit Care Med. 1988;16:954-963).<br>
Furthermore,   systemic-derived . inflammation  has recently  been  shown  to  cause  BBB  tight  junctional<br><br><br>
physiological stimuli at the cytoskeletal level, which enables it to protect the brain parenchyma and maintain a homeostatic environment.<br>
Research has shown that destruction of the BBB is associated with diseases of the CNS. However, there is little research on how the BBB might be protected.<br>
Prostaglandins (hereinafter, referred to as PG(s)) are members of class of organic carboxylic acids, which are contained in tissues or organs of human or other mammals, and exhibit a wide range of physiological activity• PGs found in nature (primary PGs) generally have a prostanoic acid skeleton as shown in the formula (A):<br><br>
On the other hand, some of synthetic analogues of primary PGs have modified skeletons. The primary PGs are classified into PGAs, PGBs, PGCs, PGDs, PGEs, PGFs, PGGs, PGHs, PGIs and PGJs according to the structure of the five-membered ring moiety, and further classified into the following three types by the number and position of the<br><br>
unsaturated bond at the carbon chain moiety: Subscript 1: 13,14-unsaturated-l5-OH Subscript 2: 5,6- and 13,14-diunsaturated-15-OH Subscript 3: 5,6-, 13,14-,and 17,18-triunsaturated~15-<br>
OH. •<br>
Further, the PGFs are classified, according to the<br>
configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 9-position, into<br>
a    type (the hydroxyl group is of an a -configuration) and (3-type (the hydroxyl group is of a p-configuration) .<br>
PGEi and PGE2 and PGE3 are known to have vasodilation, hypotension, gastric secretion decreasing, intestinal tract movement  enhancement,   uterine  contraction,   diuretic,<br>
bronchodilation and anti ulcer activities.  PGFia&gt; PGF2a and PGFaa have been known to have hypertension, vasoconstriction, intestinal tract movement enhancement, uterine contraction, lutein body atrophy and bronchoconstriction activities.<br>
Some 15-keto (i.e., having oxo at the 15-position instead of hydroxy)-PGs and 13,14-dihydro (i.e., having single bond between the 13 and 14-position)-15-keto-PGs are known as the substances naturally produced by the action of enzymes during the metabolism of primary PGs*<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,290,811 to Ueno et al. describes that some 15-keto-PG compounds are useful for improvement of encephalic function. U.S. Patent No. 5,290,811 indicates that when the bond between 13- and 14-positions is<br><br><br>
group at 11-position and the keto group at 15-position.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5r317,032 to Ueno et al. describes prostaglandin compound cathartics, including the existence of bicyclic tautomers and U.S. Patent No. 6,414,016 to Ueno describes the bicyclic tautomers as having pronounced activity as anti-constipation agents. The bicyclic tautomers, substituted by one or more halogen atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. At the C-16 position, especially, fluorine atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In the present invention, the "11-deoxy-prostaglandin compound" (hereinafter, referred to as "11-deoxy-PG compound") may include any derivatives or analogs (including substituted derivatives) of a compound having no substituent at 11-position of the prostanoic acid skeleton, irrespective of the configuration of the five-membered ring, the number of double bonds, presence or absence of a substituent, or any other modification in the a or Q chain.<br>
The formula (A) shows a basic skeleton of the C-20 carbon atoms, but the present invention is not limited to those having the same number of carbon atoms. In the formula (A), the numbering of the carbon atoms which constitute the basic skeleton of the PG- compounds starts at the carboxylic acid (numbered 1) , and carbon atoms in the a-chain are numbered 2 to 7 towards the five-membered ring,. those in the ring are 8 to 12, and those in the co-chain are 13 to 20. When the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the a-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting<br><br>
from position 2; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the a-chain, compounds are named as substitution compounds having respective substituents at position 2 in place of the carboxy group (C-l) . Similarly, when the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the co-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting from position 20; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the co-chain, the carbon atoms beyond position 2 0 are named as substituents. Stereochemistry of the compounds is the same as that of the above formula (A) unless otherwise specified. As stated above, the nomenclature of the 11-deoxy-PG compounds is based on the prostanoic acid skeleton. However, in case the compound has a similar partial structure as a prostaglandin, the abbreviation of "PG" may be used. Thus, a 11-deoxy-PG compound of which a-chain is extended by two carbon atoms, that is, having 9 carbon atoms in the a-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-11-deoxy-PG compound. Similarly, 11-deoxy-PG compound having 11 carbon atoms in the a-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(4-carboxybutyl)-11-deoxy-PG compound. Further, 11-deoxy-PG compound of which co-chain is extended by two carbon atoms, that is, having 10 carbon atoms in the co-chain is named as ll-deoxy-20-ethyl-PG compound. These compounds, however, may also be named according to the IUPAC nomenclatures.<br><br><br>
of which carboxy group at the end of a-chain is esterified; a compound of which a-chain is extended; physiologically acceptable salt thereof; a compound having a double bond at 2-3 position or a triple bond at position 5-6, a compound having substituent (s) at position 3/ 5, 6, 16, 17, 18, 19 and/or 20; and a compound having lower alkyl or a hydroxy (lower) alkyl group at position 9 in place of the hydroxy group -<br>

Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the effect of test compound. The water maze was a circular pool (painted gray, 1.48 m in diameter, 0.33 m high). The pool contained water that was maintained at a temperature<br><br><br>
of four locations (zone 4) in the pool, approximately 38 cm from the sidewall. A light bulb was placed around the pool as a cue external to the maze. The animals received 2 trials per day from 10 days after the initiation of the administration with Compound A or the vehicle. The rats were trained to locate the hidden escape platform, which remained in a fixed location throughout testing. Trials lasted a maximum of 90 sec. The latency to find the submerged platform was recorded and used as a measure of acquisition of the task. The animals were tested in this way for 4 days (total 8 trials), and then they received a probe trial on the 5th day. For the probe trial, the platform was removed from the pool and then the animal was released from the quadrant opposite to where the platform would have been located. The length of the trial was 90 sec, after which the rat was removed from the pool. The time the rat spent searching for the platform in the training quadrant (zone 4) ; i.e., the previous location of' the platform was recorded and used as an index of memory.<br><results><br>
