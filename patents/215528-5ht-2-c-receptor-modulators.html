Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which act as modulators of<br>
5HT2C receptors, compositions including the compounds, and methods of using<br>
the compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Obesity is a life-threatening disorder in which there is an increased risk of<br>
morbidity and mortality arising from concomitant diseases such as type II diabetes,<br>
hypertension, stroke, cancer and gallbladder disease.<br>
Obesity is now a major healthcare issue in the Western World and<br>
increasingly in some third world countries. The increase in numbers of obese<br>
people is due largely to the increasing preference for high fat content foods but<br>
also, and this can be a more important factor, the decrease in activity in most<br>
people"s lives. In the last 10 years there has been a 30% increase in the incidence<br>
of obesity in the USA and that about 30% of the population of the USA is now<br>
considered obese.<br>
Whether someone is classified as overweight or obese is generally<br>
determined on the basis of their body mass index (BMI) which is calculated by<br>
dividing body weight (kg) by height squared (m2). Thus, the units of BMI are<br>
kg/m2 and it is possible to calculate the BMI range associated with minimum<br>
mortality in each decade of life. Overweight is defined as a BMI in the range 25-<br>
30 kg/m2, and obesity as a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 (see TABLE below).<br>
As the BMI increases there is an increased risk of death from a variety of<br>
causes that is independent of other risk factors. The most common diseases with<br>
obesity are cardiovascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity<br>
aggravates the development of diabetes), gall bladder disease (particularly cancer)<br>
and diseases of reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest reduction in<br>
body weight can correspond to a significant reduction in the risk of developing<br>
coronary heart disease.<br>
There are problems however with the BMI definition in that it does not<br>
take into account the proportion of body mass that is muscle in relation to fat<br>
(adipose tissue). To account for this, obesity can also be defined on the basis of<br>
body fat content: greater than 25% in males and 30% in females.<br>
Obesity considerably increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases<br>
as well. Coronary insufficiency, atheromatous disease, and cardiac insufficiency are<br>
at the forefront of the cardiovascular complication induced by obesity. It is<br>
estimated that if the entire population had an ideal weight, the risk of coronary<br>
insufficiency would decrease by 25% and the risk of cardiac insufficiency and of<br>
cerebral vascular accidents by 35%. The incidence of coronary diseases is doubled<br>
in subjects less than 50 years of age who are 30% overweight. The diabetes patient<br>
faces a 30% reduced lifespan. After age 45, people with diabetes are about three<br>
times more likely than people without diabetes to have significant heart disease and<br>
up to five times more likely to have a stroke. These findings emphasize the inter-<br>
relations between risks factors for NIDDM and coronary heart disease and the<br>
potential value of an integrated approach to the prevention of these conditions based<br>
on the prevention of obesity (Perry, I. J., et al., BMJ 310, 560-564 (1995)).<br>
Diabetes has also been implicated in the development of kidney disease, eye<br>
diseases and nervous-system problems. Kidney disease, also called nephropathy,<br>
occurs when the kidney"s "filter mechanism" is damaged and protein leaks into urine<br>
in excessive amounts and eventually the kidney fails. Diabetes is also a leading<br>
cause of damage to the retina at the back of the eye and increases risk of cataracts<br>
and glaucoma. Finally, diabetes is associated with nerve damage, especially in the<br>
legs and feet, which interferes with the ability to sense pain and contributes to<br>
serious infections. Taken together, diabetes complications are one of the nation"s<br>
leading causes of death.<br>
The first line of treatment is to offer diet and life style advice to patients<br>
such as reducing the fat content of their diet and increasing their physical activity.<br>
However many patients find this difficult and need additional help from drug<br>
therapy to maintain results from these efforts.<br>
Most currently marketed products have been unsuccessful as treatments for<br>
obesity owing to a lack of efficacy or unacceptable side-effect profiles. The most<br>
successful drug so far was the indirectly acting 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<br>
agonist d-fcnfluramine (Redux™) but reports of cardiac valve defects in up to one<br>
third of patients led to its withdrawal by the FDA in 1998.<br>
In addition, two drugs have recently been launched in the USA and<br>
Europe: Orlistat (Xenical™), a drug that prevents absorption of fat by the<br>
inhibition of pancreatic lipase, and Sibutramine (Reductil™), a 5-<br>
HT/noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor. However, side effects associated with these<br>
products may limit their long-term utility. Treatment with Xenical™ is reported to<br>
induce gastrointestinal distress in some patients, while Sibutramine has been<br>
associated with raised blood pressure in some patients.<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission plays an important role in numerous<br>
physiological processes both in health and in psychiatric disorders. 5-HT has been<br>
implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior for some time. 5-HT appears to<br>
work by inducing a feeling of fullness or satiety so eating stops earlier and fewer<br>
calories are consumed. It has been shown that a stimulatory action of 5-HT on the<br>
5HT2c receptor plays an important role in the control of eating and in the anti-<br>
obesity effect of d-fenfluramine. As the 5-HT2C receptor is expressed in high<br>
density in the brain (notably in the limbic structures, extrapyramidal pathways,<br>
thalamus and hypothalamus i.e. PVN and DMH, and predominantly in the choroid<br>
plexus) and is expressed in low density or is absent in peripheral tissues, a<br>
selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist can be a more effective and safe anti-obesity<br>
agent. Also, 5-HT2C knockout mice are overweight with cognitive impairment and<br>
susceptibility to seizure.<br>
It is believed that 5HT2C may play a role in obsessive compulsive disorder,<br>
some forms of depression, and epilepsy. Accordingly, agonists can have anti-<br>
panic properties, and properties useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction.<br>
In sum, the 5HT2C receptor is a validated and well-accepted receptor target<br>
for the treatment of obesity and psychiatric disorders, and it can be seen that there<br>
is a need for selective 5HT2C agonists which safely decrease food intake and body<br>
weight. The present invention is directed to these, as well as other, important<br>
ends.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to 5HT2c receptor agonist compounds,<br>
methods of modulating 5HT2C receptors by contacting the receptors with one or<br>
more compounds of the invention. The present invention also relates to methods<br>
of decreasing food intake, controlling weight gain, or treating obesity, using<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
The term "antagonist" is intended to mean moieties that competitively<br>
bind to the receptor at the same site as agonists (for example, the endogenous<br>
ligand), but which do not activate the intracellular response initiated by the active<br>
form of the receptor, and can thereby inhibit the intracellular responses by agonists<br>
or partial agonists. Antagonists do not diminish the baseline intracellular response<br>
in the absence of an agonist or partial agonist. As used herein, the term "agonist"<br>
is intended to mean moieties that activate the intracellular response when they<br>
bind to the receptor, or enhance GTP binding to membranes. In the context of the<br>
present invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a 5HT2C receptor<br>
agonist of the invention can be utilized for modulating the activity of the 5HT2C<br>
receptor, decreasing food intake, inducing satiation (i.e., the feeling of fullness),<br>
controlling weight gain, treating obesity, decreasing body weight and/or affecting<br>
metabolism such that the recipient loses weight and/or maintains weight. Such<br>
pharmaceutical compositions can be used in the context of disorders and/or<br>
diseases where weight gain is a component of the disease and/or disorder such as,<br>
for example, obesity.<br>
As used herein, the term "contact" or "contacting" shall mean bringing<br>
the indicated moieties together, whether in an in vitro system or an in vivo system.<br>
Thus, "contacting" an 5HT2C receptor with a compound of the invention includes<br>
the administration of a compound of the invention to an animal having an 5HT2C<br>
receptor, as well as, for example, introducing a compound of the invention into a<br>
sample containing a cellular or more purified preparation containing an 5HT2C<br>
receptor.<br>

The compounds according to the invention may optionally exist as<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids<br>
including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic,<br>
benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, dichloroacetic, formic, fumaric,<br>
gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic,<br>
malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic,<br>
phosphoric, succinic, sulfiric, tartaric, oxalic, p-toluenesulfonic and the like, such<br>
as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in Journal of Pharmaceutical<br>
Science, 66,2 (1977) and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The acid addition salts can be obtained as the direct products of compound<br>
synthesis. In the alternative, the free base can be dissolved in a suitable solvent<br>
containing the appropriate acid, and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or<br>
otherwise separating the salt and solvent. The compounds of this invention may<br>
form solvates with standard low molecular weight solvents using methods known<br>
to the skilled artisan.<br>
Compositions of the invention may conveniently be administered in unit<br>
dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical art, for example, as described in Remington"s Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA, 1980).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be employed as the sole active agent<br>
in a pharmaceutical or can be used in combination with other active ingredients<br>
which could facilitate the therapeutic effect of the compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention or a solvate or physiologically<br>
functional derivative thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, specifically as SHTzc receptor agonists. By the term "active<br>
ingredient" is defined in the context of a "pharmaceutical composition" and shall<br>
mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary<br>
pharmaceutical benefit, as opposed to an "inactive ingredient" which would<br>
generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit. The term<br>
"pharmaceutical composition" shall mean a composition comprising at least one<br>
active ingredient and at least one ingredient that is not an active ingredient (for<br>
example and not limitation, a filler, dye, or a mechanism for slow release),<br>
whereby the composition is amenable to use for a specified, efficacious outcome<br>
in a mammal (for example, and not limitation, a human).<br>
The data developed herein supports the conclusion that the presently<br>
disclosed 5HT2C receptor agonists are of use for the treatment or prophylaxis of<br>
clinical obesity or overweight disorders in mammals, including, but not limited to,<br>
human. Compounds of the present invention can be administered by oral,<br>
sublingual, parenteral, rectal, topical administration or by a transdermal patch.<br>
Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for<br>
absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug.<br>
Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques<br>
appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon<br>
the needs of the artisan.<br>
In addition to the neutral forms of compounds of the present invention, by<br>
appropriate addition of an ionizable substituent, which does not alter the receptor<br>
specificity of the compound, physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds<br>
may also be formed and used as therapeutic agents. Different amounts of the<br>
compounds of the present invention will be required to achieve the desired<br>
biological effect. The amount will depend on factors such as the specific<br>
compound, the use for which it is intended, the means of administration, and the<br>
condition of the treated individual - all of these dosing parameters are within the<br>
level of one of ordinary skill in the medicinal arts. A typical dose can be expected<br>
to fall in the range of 0.001 to 200 mg per kilogram of body weight of the<br>
mammal. Unit doses may contain from 1 to 200 mg of the compounds of the<br>
present invention and can be administered one or more times a day, individually or<br>
in multiples.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions, including, but not limited to, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, comprising at least one compound of the present invention and/or<br>
an acceptable salt or solvate thereof (e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or<br>
solvate) as an active ingredient combined with at least one carrier or excipient<br>
(e.g., pharmaceutical carrier or excipient) can be used in the treatment of clinical<br>
conditions for which a 5HT2C receptor agonist is indicated. At least one<br>
compound of the present invention can be combined with the carrier in either solid<br>
or liquid form in a unit dose formulation. The pharmaceutical carrier must be<br>
compatible with the other ingredients in the composition and must be tolerated by<br>
the individual recipient. Other physiologically active ingredients can be<br>
incorporated into the pharmaceutical composition of the invention if desired, and<br>
if such ingredients are compatible with the other ingredients in the composition.<br>
Formulations can be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly<br>
mixing the active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or<br>
both, in the required proportions, and then, if necessary, forming the resulting<br>
mixture into a desired shape.<br>
Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting<br>
agents, tabletting lubricants, and disintegrants can be used in tablets and capsules<br>
for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration can be in the<br>
form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions, and syrups.<br>
Alternatively, the oral preparations can be in the form of dry powder that can be<br>
reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional<br>
additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles<br>
(including edible oils), preservatives, and flavorings and colorants can be added to<br>
the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms can be prepared by dissolving the<br>
compound of the invention in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the<br>
solution before filling and sealing an appropriate vial or ampoule. These are just a<br>
few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for<br>
preparing dosage forms.<br>
It is noted that when the 5HT2C receptor agonists are utilized as active<br>
ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition, these are not intended for use only in<br>
humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the<br>
area of animal health-care mandate that consideration be given for the use of<br>
5HT2C receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity in domestic animals (e.g., cats<br>
and dogs), and 5HT2c receptor agonists in other domestic animals where no<br>
disease or disorder is evident (e.g., food-oriented animals such as cows, chickens,<br>
fish, etc.). Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with<br>
understanding the utility of such compounds in such settings.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be readily prepared according<br>
to a variety of synthetic manipulations, all of which would be familiar to one<br>
skilled in the art. A representative general synthesis is set forth below in Scheme<br>
Scheme I<br>
GENERAL REACTION SCHEME<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate that a wide variety of compounds of<br>
the invention can be prepared according to Scheme I. For example, by starting<br>
with an appropriately substituted 2-phenyl ethylamino compound A having any of<br>
a wide variety of substituents R1 and R2, the corresponding 7- and/or 8-substituted<br>
l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine (compound H) can be prepared.<br>
N-alkylation can be accomplished by, for example, treatment with excess<br>
paraformaldehyde (for methylation) or a higher order aldehyde, followed by<br>
reduction with NaBH1CN according to the general procedure of synthetic<br>
examples 9 and 10, infra. In addition, by starting with an appropriately substituted<br>
1 -alkyl-2-phenyl ethylamino compound A having any of a wide variety of<br>
substituents R1 and R2, the corresponding 7- and/or 8-substituted 2,5-dialkly-<br>
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine compound can be prepared.<br>
In the synthesis of many compounds of the invention, protecting groups<br>
can be required to protect various functionality or functionalities during the<br>
synthesis. Representative protecting groups suitable for a wide variety of<br>
synthetic transformations are disclosed in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, 2d ed, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
As will be recognized, the steps of the methods of the present invention<br>
need not be performed any particular number of times or in any particular<br>
sequence. Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of this invention will<br>
become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following<br>
examples thereof, which are intended to be illustrative and not intended to be<br>
limiting.<br>

Cells were then incubated for 3-4 hours at 37°C/5%CO2 and then transfection<br>
media was removed and replaced with 100ul of DMEM. Cells were then plated<br>
onto 100cm sterile dishes. The next day cells were plated into 96 well PDL<br>
microtiter plates at a density of 55K/0.2ml. Six hours latter, media was exchanged<br>
with [3H]inositol (0.25 uCi/well) in inositol free DMEM and plates were<br>
incubated at 37OC/5%CO2 overnight. The next day, wells were aspirated and 200ul<br>
of DMEM containing test compound, 10uM pargyline, and 10mM LiCl was added<br>
to appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37°C/5%CO2 for three hours<br>
followed aspiration and by addition of fresh ice cold stop solution (1M KOH,<br>
19mM Na-borate, 3.8 mM EDTA) to each well. Plates were kept on ice for 5-10<br>
min and the wells were neutralized by addition of 200ul of fresh ice cold<br>
neutralization solution (7.5% HC1). Plates were then frozen until further<br>
processing is desired. The lysate was then transferred into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes<br>
and 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2) was added/tube. The solution was<br>
vortexed for 15 seconds and the upper phase was applied to a Biorad AG1-X8™<br>
anion exchange resin (100-200 mesh). First, the resin was washed with water at<br>

Inhibition of food intake in food-deprived rats<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350g) were deprived of food overnight<br>
prior to testing. Prior to food deprivation, the animals were weighed and separated<br>
into treatment groups in order to balance groups according to body weight. On the<br>
test day, animals were placed into individual cages (no bedding) at 9:00am with<br>
free access to water. At 10:00am, animals were injected with test compound (p.o.,<br>
i.p., or s.c.) and then presented with a pre-weighed amount of food in a dish either<br>
60min (p.o.) or 30min (i.p. and s.c.) after drug administration. Food consumption<br>
over different time points was then determined by weighing the food cup at 1, 2,4,<br>
and 6hr after the food was presented. Thus, food consumption was measured at 2,<br>
3,5, and 7hr post-injection in p.o. studies, and at 1.5,2.5,4.5, and 6.5hr post-<br>
injection in i.p. and s.c. studies.<br>
Figures 1A-G illustrate the effects of seven different compounds on food<br>
intake in food-deprived rats. All compounds inhibited food intake dose-<br>
dependently. This effect was consistently most pronounced over the first 1 hr after<br>
food presentation. Some compounds (Figures 1 A, 1C, and 1E) maintained an<br>
inhibitory effect on food intake relative to vehicle-treated controls at 6hr after food<br>
presentation. Compounds were also shown to be effective via all routes of<br>
administration including p.o.<br>
