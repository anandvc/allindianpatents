				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO DETECT A MODE-GEAR<br>
MISMATCH DURING STEADY STATE OPERATION<br>
OF AN ELECTRO MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure pertains generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline and to wheels of the vehicle. Electric machines, operatively<br>
connected to an electrical energy storage device, comprise motor/generators<br>
operable to generate motive torque for input to the transmission,<br>
independently of torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
electric machines are further operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
the electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain system, including controlling transmission gear shifting,<br>
controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical power<br>
interchange between the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines.<br><br>
[0004] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear operation and continuously variable operation through<br>
actuation of torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic circuit to<br>
effect clutch actuation. A fixed gear operation occurs when the ratio of the<br>
rotational speed of the transmission output member to the rotational speed of<br>
the input member is constant, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable operation occurs when the ratio of<br>
the rotational speed of the transmission output member to the rotational speed<br>
of the input member is variable based upon operating speeds of one or more<br>
electric machines. The electric machines can be selectively connected to the<br>
output member via actuation of a clutch, or directly by fixed mechanical<br>
connections. Clutch actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a<br>
hydraulic circuit, including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management<br>
valves, pressure control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled<br>
by a control module.<br>
[0005] During operation, there is a need to monitor operation to identify a<br>
mismatch between a commanded operating range state and an actual operating<br>
range state. In such a situation, a mode-gear mismatch may occur, including<br>
for example the control system commanding continuously variable operation,<br>
when the transmission is actually operating in fixed gear operation. However,<br>
operation of the powertrain may mask presence of the mismatch. When this<br>
occurs, the control system tries to force engine speed to a calculated optimum<br>
speed intended for a continuously variable operation. The result may be an<br>
unwanted change in operation of the vehicle. There is a need to effectively<br>
identify absence of a mismatch, identify presence of a mismatch, and mitigate<br>
effects of any mismatch.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] A powertrain includes an electro-mechanical transmission<br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to an internal combustion engine and a pair<br>
of electric machines for mechanical power flow to an output through selective<br>
actuation of a plurality of torque-transfer clutches. The electric machines are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled to an energy storage system for electric power<br>
flow therebetween. A method for controlling the powertrain includes<br>
commanding operation of the electro-mechanical transmission in a<br>
continuously variable operating range state and monitoring operation of the<br>
transmission. Absence of a mismatch between the commanded continuously<br>
variable operating range state and an actual operating state of the transmission<br>
is determined. And, presence of a mismatch between the commanded<br>
continuously variable operating range state and the actual operating state of<br>
the transmission is detected. When a mismatch between the commanded<br>
continuously variable operating range state and the actual operating state of<br>
the transmission is detected, powertrain operation is modified.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating embodiments of the invention only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an<br>
engine 14, transmission 10, driveline 90, control system, and hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42 (Fig. 4) which has been constructed in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system is configured to execute the control scheme depicted hereinbelow with<br>
reference to Fig. 5. Mechanical aspects of the exemplary transmission 10 are<br>
disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the concepts of the present<br>
invention is depicted in Fig. 1. The transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12<br>
having an input speed, N1 that is preferably driven by the internal combustion<br>
engine 14, and an output shaft 64 having an output rotational speed, No.<br>
[0013] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission via shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a<br>
compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 has a crankshaft having<br>
characteristic speed NE which is operatively connected to the transmission<br>
input shaft 12. The output of the engine, comprising speed NE and output<br>
torque TE can differ from transmission input speed NI and engine input torque<br>
TI when a torque management device (not shown) is placed therebetween.<br>
[0014] The transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28,<br>
and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. An electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 17, is operative to control actuation and<br>
deactivation of the clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-actuated rotating friction clutches. Clutches Cl and C3<br>
preferably comprise comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices<br><br>
grounded to the transmission case 68. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically<br>
actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump 88 via an electro-<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0015] There is a first electric machine comprising a motor/generator 56,<br>
referred to as MG-A, and a second electric machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B operatively connected to the<br>
transmission via the planetary gears. Each of the machines includes a stator, a<br>
rotor, and a resolver assembly 80, 82. The stator for each machine is<br>
grounded to outer transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled<br>
electrical windings extending therefrom. The rotor for MG-A 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operably attached to output shaft 60 via carrier 26.<br>
The rotor for MG-B 72 is attached to sleeve shaft hub 66. The resolver<br>
assemblies 80, 82 are appropriately positioned and assembled on MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72. Each resolver assembly 80, 82 comprises a known variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator, operably connected to the stator<br>
of each electric machine, and a resolver rotor, operably connected to the rotor<br>
of each electric machine. Each resolver 80, 82 comprises a sensing device<br>
adapted to sense rotational position of the resolver stator relative to the<br>
resolver rotor, and identify the rotational position. Signals output from the<br>
resolvers are interpreted to provide rotational speeds for MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72, referred to as NA and NB. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably<br>
connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive output torque, To, to<br>
vehicle wheels. There is a transmission output speed sensor 84, operative to<br>
monitor rotational speed of the output shaft 64. Each of the vehicle wheels is<br>
equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed, the output of<br>
which is monitored by the control system and used to determine absolute<br>
wheel speed and relative wheel speed for braking control, traction control, and<br>
vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-generative<br>
devices, including the engine 14, and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, referred to as<br><br>
'TI', 'TA', and 'TB' respectively, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or<br>
electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter module<br>
(TPIM) 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the<br>
control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical energy to and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29,<br>
and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72<br>
by transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the<br>
ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective motor<br>
control modules configured to receive motor control commands and control<br>
inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase AC<br>
machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that is mounted<br>
on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module (ECM) 23,<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 17, battery pack control module (BPCM)<br>
21, and TPIM 19. A hybrid control module (HCP) 5 provides overarching<br>
control and coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a<br>
User Interface (UI) 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through<br><br>
which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation of the<br>
powertrain including the transmission 10, including an operator torque request<br>
(To_req) and operator brake request (BRAKE). Exemplary vehicle input<br>
devices to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, a transmission<br>
gear selector, and a vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned<br>
control modules communicates with other control modules, sensors, and<br>
actuators via a local area network (LAN) bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands among the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for<br>
robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the<br>
aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0018] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: the operator torque request (Toreq), the engine input<br>
torque TI, clutch torque, (TCL_N) for the N various torque-transfer clutches Cl,<br>
C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10; and motor torques TAand TB for MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, including for monitoring various pressure sensing devices<br>
(not shown) and generating and executing control signals for various solenoids<br>
to control pressure switches and control valves contained therein.<br>
[0019] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine input torque, T,, to the transmission, which is<br><br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12 (which translate to<br>
transmission input speed, NI) manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0020] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM ] 7 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques (TCL_N) for each of the N clutches, i.e., C1, C2, C3,<br>
and C4, and rotational output speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other<br>
actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the<br>
TCM to the HCP for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from<br>
pressure switches and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift<br>
solenoids to actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating<br>
modes, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0021] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, amp-hour throughput, battery temperature,<br>
battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0022] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br><br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0023] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Fig. 3, the exemplary two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission operates in one of several operating range<br>
states comprising fixed gear operation and continuously variable operation,<br>
described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
[0025] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches Cl, C2, C3, and CA are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating range states. A first continuously variable<br>
operating range state, i.e., Mode I, is selected when clutch Cl 70 is actuated in<br>
order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. The<br>
engine 14 can be either on or off. A second continuously variable operating<br>
range state, i.e., Mode II, is selected when clutch C1 70 is released and clutch<br>
C2 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28. Again, the engine 14 can be either on or off. For<br>
purposes of this description, Engine Off is defined by engine input speed, NE,<br>
being equal to zero revolutions per minute (RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft<br>
is not rotating, typically as a result of the engine being decoupled from the<br>
transmission. Other factors outside the scope of this disclosure affect when<br>
the electric machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are not<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0026] Mode I and Mode II are characterized by single clutch applications,<br>
i.e., either clutch Cl 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of<br>
the electric machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously<br>
variable transmission mode. Certain operating rage states are described below<br>
in which fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This<br>
additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
When the additional clutch is applied, fixed gear operation of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e., NI/No, is achieved. During fixed gear<br>
operation, the rotations of machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, i.e., NA and NB,<br>
are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the<br>
clutching and proportional to the input speed measured at shaft 12.<br>
[0027] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine the operator torque request to be executed at shaft 64.<br>
Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road<br><br>
load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The transmission operating range state is<br>
determined for the exemplary transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an operator demand for<br>
torque, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously<br>
described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external<br>
conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load.<br>
The transmission operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain<br>
torque demand caused by a control module command to operate one of the<br>
electric machines as an electrical generator or as an electric motor. The<br>
transmission operating range state can be determined by an optimization<br>
algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum system efficiency based<br>
upon operator demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy<br>
efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system<br>
manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based<br>
upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
optimization occurs to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy<br>
and manage battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the<br>
parametric states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output<br>
of the transmission required to arrive at the desired torque output, as described<br>
hereinbelow. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
[0028] The energy storage system and electric machines MG-A 56 and MG-<br>
B 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween.<br>
Furthermore, the engine, the electric machines, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output. In Mode I operation, the<br>
transmission operates as an input-split electrically variable transmission<br>
(EVT). In Mode II operation, the transmission operates as a compound-split<br><br>
EVT. While operating in either of these two modes, the control system<br>
performs closed loop control on an engine speed which optimizes fuel<br>
economy while still meeting the torque request and given power constraints.<br>
It then commands motor speeds to vary the input-to-output speed ratio to<br>
accelerate the vehicle, in response to the operator torque request. Through use<br>
of the two additional clutches, the transmission also has the capability of<br>
achieving one of four fixed gear ratios. While operating in a fixed gear, the<br>
vehicle acts as a parallel hybrid and the motors are used only for boosting and<br>
braking/regeneration the vehicle.<br>
[0029] Referring to Fig. 4, a schematic diagram is depicted which provides a<br>
more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for<br>
controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission. The main<br>
hydraulic pump 88, driven off the input shaft 12 from the engine 14, and<br>
auxiliary pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19,<br>
provides pressurized fluid to the hydraulic circuit 42 through valve 140. The<br>
auxiliary pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, which is<br>
operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices,<br>
including the torque-transfer clutches C\ 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, active<br>
cooling circuits for machines A and B, and a base cooling circuit for cooling<br>
and lubricating the transmission 10 via passages 142, 144 (not depicted in<br>
detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate the<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operation through selective<br>
actuation of hydraulic circuit flow control devices comprising variable<br>
pressure control solenoids (PCS) PCS1 108, PCS2 112, PCS3 114, PCS4 116<br>
and solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-valve 119 and Y-valve<br>
121. The circuit is fluidly connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and<br>
PS4 via passages 124, 122, 126, and 128, respectively. There is an inlet spool<br><br>
valve 107. The pressure control solenoid PCS1 108 has a control position of<br>
normally high and is operative to modulate fluidic pressure in the hydraulic<br>
circuit through fluidic interaction with controllable pressure regulator 109.<br>
Controllable pressure regulator 109, not shown in detail, interacts with PCS1<br>
108 to control hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic circuit 42 over a range of<br>
pressures, depending upon operating conditions as described hereinafter.<br>
Pressure control solenoid PCS2 112 has a control position of normally low,<br>
and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow<br>
therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switch PS3 via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has a control<br>
position of normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and<br>
operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is<br>
fluidly connected to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS4 116 has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
[0030] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High (1) and Low (0). The control states<br>
refer to positions of each valve with which to control flow to different devices<br>
in the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is<br>
operative to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 and C4 and cooling<br>
systems for stators of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 via fluidic passages 136, 138,<br>
144, 142 respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is<br>
described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to direct pressurized fluid<br>
to clutches Cl and C2 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively,<br>
depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter.<br>
The Y-valve 121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122.<br>
A more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit<br><br>
42 is provided in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/263,216,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0031] An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the exemplary<br>
electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 2,<br>
below.<br><br>
[0032] Selective control of the X and Y valves and actuation of the solenoids<br>
PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutches<br>
C1, C2, C3, and C4, and provide cooling for the stators of MG-A 56 and MG-<br>
B 72.<br><br>
[0033] In operation, one of the fixed gear and continuously variable<br>
operating range states is determined for the exemplary transmission based<br>
upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an<br>
operator torque request, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as<br>
previously described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated<br>
on external conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or<br>
wind load. Transmission operating range state may be predicated on a<br>
powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to operate of<br>
the electric machines as an electrical generator or as an electrical motor.<br>
Operation can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine operable<br>
to determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for<br>
power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and<br>
MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the<br>
engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system optimization occurs to optimize system<br>
efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery charging.<br>
Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component<br>
or system.<br>
[0034] Referring now to the transmission described with reference to Figs. 1,<br>
2, 3, and 4, and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of the transmission and<br>
control system are described herein. The control system is operative to<br>
selectively actuate the pressure control devices and the flow management<br>
valves based upon a demand for torque, presence of a fault, and temperatures<br>
of the electric motors. The control system selectively commands one of a low-<br>
range continuously variable operation, a high-range continuously variable<br>
operation, a low range state, and a high range state based upon selective<br>
actuation of the X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120 flow management valves. The<br>
control system effects actuation of the stator cooling system for the first<br>
electric machine (MG-A Stator Cool), the stator cooling system for the second<br>
electric machine (MG-B Stator Cool), and the first hydraulically-actuated<br><br>
clutch (C1) based upon selective actuation of the pressure control devices<br>
PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 when the low-range continuously variable operation<br>
has been commanded. Furthermore, the control system is operative to effect<br>
actuation of the stator cooling system for MG-A 56, stator cooling system for<br>
MG-B 72, and the second hydraulically-actuated clutch C2 based upon<br>
selective actuation of the pressure control devices when a high-range<br>
continuously variable operation has been commanded. The control system is<br>
operative to effect actuation of the first, second, and fourth hydraulically-<br>
actuated clutches (i.e., C1, C2, C4) based upon selective actuation of the<br>
pressure control devices when a low-range state has been commanded,<br>
comprising operation in one of FG1, FG2, Mode I via selective actuation of<br>
the clutches. The control system is operative to effect actuation of the second,<br>
third, and fourth hydraulically-actuated clutches (i.e., C2, C3, C4) based upon<br>
selective actuation of the pressure control devices when a high-range state has<br>
been commanded, comprising operation in one of FG3, FG4, and Mode II via<br>
selective actuation of the clutches.<br>
[0035] As previously stated, fluid output from each of the second, third and<br>
fourth pressure control devices (i.e., PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4) is selectively<br>
mapped to one of the four hydraulically-actuated clutches and stator cooling<br>
systems for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon commanded positions of the<br>
first and second flow management valves. Therefore, selective actuation of<br>
PCS2 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B<br>
72, when both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective<br>
actuation of PCS2 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C2 when<br>
either of the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to High. Selective<br>
actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch Cl when<br>
both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective actuation<br>
of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-<br>
B 72 when the X-valve is commanded to Low and the Y-valve is commanded<br>
to High. Selective actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate<br><br>
clutch Cl when the X-valve is commanded to High and the Y-valve is<br>
commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic<br>
fluid to actuate clutch C3 when both the X-valve and the Y-valve are<br>
commanded to High. Selective actuation of PCS4 effects flow of hydraulic<br>
fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-A 56 when the X-valve is<br>
commanded to Low, regardless of the position to which the Y-valve is<br>
commanded. Selective actuation of PCS4 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to<br>
actuate clutch C4 when the X-valve is commanded to High, regardless of the<br>
position to which the Y-valve is commanded.<br>
[0036] Referring now to the flowchart 400 depicted in Fig. 5, with reference<br>
to the exemplary transmission described with reference to Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4,<br>
and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of controlling operation of the exemplary<br>
transmission and control system are described. In operation, the electro-<br>
mechanical transmission is commanded by one of the control modules to<br>
operate in one of the continuously variable operating range states (Step 410),<br>
i.e., either Mode I or II, through selective actuation of either clutch C1 or<br>
clutch C2. Operation of the transmission is monitored, including the rotational<br>
speeds of various elements, including specifically transmission speeds No, NA,<br>
and NB (Step 412). Other elements are monitored, as required for operation of<br>
the system, e.g., NE, TA, and TB. An absence of a mismatch between the<br>
commanded operating range state and the actual operating state of the<br>
transmission is determined based upon the monitored operation of the<br>
transmission (Step 414). Presence of a mismatch between the commanded<br>
operating range state and the actual operating state of the transmission is<br>
detected based upon the monitored operation of the transmission, including<br>
presence of excess motor torque and clutch slippage (Steps 416, 418). The<br>
commanded operation of the internal combustion engine is modified when a<br>
mismatch between the commanded operating range state and an actual<br>
operating state of the transmission is detected (Step 420). This is now<br>
described in detail.<br><br>
[0037] A potential powertrain system fault includes a mismatch between a<br>
commanded operating range state and an actual operating state of the<br>
transmission. This includes the control system commanding operation in one<br>
of the continuously variable operating range states, whereas the transmission<br>
actually operates in one of the fixed gear operating range states. This is<br>
referred to as a mode-gear mismatch. During ongoing operation, the control<br>
system commands either of continuously variable operating range states,<br>
Mode 1 and Mode II, as depicted in Table 2. In each Mode operation only one<br>
clutch is applied for the exemplary embodiment, which corresponds to one<br>
pressure control solenoid (PCS) in the hydraulically high state. The hydraulic<br>
system is designed such that if a hardware fault occurs affecting either of the<br>
remaining two pressure control solenoids while operating in either Mode I or<br>
Mode II, the only result is motor stator cooling.<br>
[0038] It can be seen that in both Mode I or Mode II, the X-valve 119 is in a<br>
hydraulically low state. If there is a fault in the X-valve causing it to remain<br>
in a hydraulically high state, a single fault in one of the PCS devices can lead<br>
to an unacceptable operating condition. For example, were the X valve to<br>
have a fault causing it to remain 'HIGH', the vehicle continues to operate in<br>
Mode I by operating in the 'Low Range' state and commanding PCS3<br>
hydraulically high. However, any subsequent fault on PCS2 in HIGH position<br>
may result in application of clutch C2, with a corresponding mismatch, in that<br>
Mode I is commanded, whereas FG2 is executed in the transmission.<br>
[0039] A first tactic for detecting a mode-gear mismatch includes<br>
affirmatively determining an absence of any mode-gear mismatch by<br>
monitoring clutch slippage. This detection tactic comprises monitoring and<br>
detecting clutch slippage during steady state operation in one of Mode I and II,<br>
wherein only a single clutch is applied, i.e., commanded actuated. During<br>
operation, only a single clutch, i.e., either C1 or C2, is expected to<br>
demonstrate clutch slippage at or near-zero during any given period of time.<br>
When there is a significant amount of slip across a clutch for a period of time<br><br>
it can be determined that the specific clutch is not actuated, and there is no<br>
mode-gear mismatch. Thus, in Mode I, Clutch C1 is commanded actuated,<br>
with slippage occurring across each of clutches C2, C3, and C4. Thus, in<br>
Mode II, Clutch C2 is commanded actuated, with slippage occurring across<br>
each of clutches C1, C3, and C4. When such slippage conditions are<br>
determined for the clutches whose actuation is not commanded, the control<br>
strategy affirms the absence of a mode-gear mismatch. However, if a<br>
condition occurs wherein it is determined that one of the unactuated clutches<br>
has slippage at or near zero slip speed for more than a minimal amount of<br>
time, then there is a potential that the clutch is actuated, and a potential for a<br>
mode-gear mismatch. Slippage across each of the clutches is determined<br>
based upon the various measured rotational speeds of NE, No, NA, and NB.<br>
[0040] A second tactic for detecting a mode-gear mismatch includes<br>
affirmatively determining an absence of a mode-gear mismatch by monitoring<br>
engine input speed. During operation in Mode I or Mode II, the control<br>
system controls input speed, NI, to a calculated optimum engine speed,<br>
Ni_opt. In closed loop control around the optimum input speed, Niopt, the<br>
input speed is expected to follow an optimum speed profile, determined based<br>
upon operating conditions and operator inputs. In the system described<br>
hereinabove, the relationship between various speeds is fixed by the hardware,<br>
comprising (NA + NB)/2 = NI. In this tactic, the motor speeds NA and NB are<br>
measured with the resolvers 80, 82, and input speed, NI, is calculated<br>
therefrom. In the event of a mode-gear mismatch, it is likely that there is a<br>
significant difference between the current engine speed, NI, and the optimum<br>
input speed, Niopt, which is determined as a part of the engine and system<br>
operation. Therefore, when the input speed, NI, follows the optimum input<br>
speed, Niopt, the control strategy affirms the absence of a mode-gear<br>
mismatch, and when there is a difference in the input speed and the optimum<br>
input speed, there is potentially a mode-gear mismatch.<br><br>
[0041] When the outcomes of the first and second tactics are unable to<br>
affirm the absence of a mode-gear mismatch, additional tactics are executed to<br>
detect the presence of a mode-gear mismatch. For example, during steady<br>
state operation a mode-gear mismatch may occur which is unperceivable to<br>
the vehicle operator, or results in a light acceleration event. A third tactic for<br>
detecting a mode-gear mismatch includes affirmatively detecting presence of<br>
the mode-gear mismatch by monitoring motor torque from both of the electric<br>
machines. During operation in either Mode I or Mode II, the control system<br>
calculates the motor torque needed from both the electric machines to achieve<br>
the optimum closed loop engine speed control, Niopt. The current motor<br>
torques from the machines are determined based upon electric power<br>
transferred thereto. Excess torque for each motor, based upon a difference<br>
between the current motor torque and calculated motor torque, is calculated.<br>
A calculation indicating a significant amount of excess torque being applied<br>
by one of the electric machines to one of the clutches indicates presence of a<br>
mode-gear mismatch.<br>
[0042] A fourth tactic for detecting a mode-gear mismatch includes<br>
affirmatively detecting presence of the mode-gear mismatch by monitoring<br>
slippage of the clutches to detect zero-slip conditions. During operation in<br>
either Mode I or Mode II, a clutch which is not actuated is expected to have<br>
slippage. By monitoring clutch slippage, a zero-slip condition can be<br>
determined. When the output speed is not decelerating, then slip speed of an<br>
oncoming clutch eventually reaches near-zero speed (steady state), even<br>
during a mode-gear mismatch. Therefore, when there is no clutch slippage in<br>
an unapplied clutch, the control strategy is able to detect a mode-gear<br>
mismatch.<br><br>
[0043] When a mode-gear mismatch is experienced and detected, operation<br>
of the powertrain is preferably modified in a timely manner. Modifying<br>
powertrain operation includes disabling the closed loop engine speed control,<br>
to prevent the control system from varying the engine input speed, preferably<br>
within 200 msec of the detection. This includes sending a software control<br>
flag to the control system to disable the closed loop engine control, and<br>
subsequently informing the operator by illuminating a dashboard lamp. When<br>
affirmative pass is subsequently detected, i.e., an outcome of executing the<br>
first or second tactics results in a pass condition for a calibratable length of<br>
time, the closed loop engine control is preferably re-enabled.<br>
[0044] There are preferably different conditions for affirmatively<br>
determining an absence of the mode-gear mismatch, and affirmatively<br>
determining a presence of a mode-gear mismatch. Therefore, there can be a<br>
condition wherein a vehicle may both determine an absence and determine a<br>
presence of a mode-gear mismatch at the same time. This may occur during a<br>
short time window when the vehicle is experiencing a sharp deceleration due<br>
to an oncoming clutch which still has a slip speed above the threshold of the<br>
pass criteria. For this reason the action of disabling the closed loop speed<br>
control continues until the pass condition has been met for a calibratable<br>
amount of time, typically less than four seconds. If the clutch continues to be<br>
applied, the clutch slip speed drops below the pass condition threshold within<br>
the calibratable amount of time and engine closed loop remains disabled. If<br>
the clutch is no longer applied, and the test continues to pass, engine closed<br>
loop control is re-enabled.<br>

alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
