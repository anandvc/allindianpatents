GEAR   BOX  WITH   AN   OIL   CIRCUIT   PIPE   WORK   AND   GEAR   BOX PRODUCTION SERIES<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention is with regard to a gear box with an oil circuit pipe work and a gear box production series.<br>
A lubricating agent that must flow to bearing journals and gear teeth even when oil levels are low, is filled in gear boxes in order to reduce frictional heat and protect against wear and tear.<br>
A gear box control device, in which an additional gear pair is provided at a torque converter, which activates an oil pump, is established in DE 101 43 929 A1.<br>
A gear box unit and a control platform for operation in a gear box are established in DE 199 50 967 A1, whereby an electronic and a hydraulic control device are located in direct proximity in the transmission case.<br>
A platform gear box and a gear box kit in which a supply unit comprises a pump device, case are established in DE 101 23 194 A1.<br>
An all-purpose gear reduction unit in which a transmission case is formed by steel plates that are fastened with bolts, is established in US 3 029 661.<br><br>
A flow controller in which a resistance element that can be moved from a first to a second position is located in the flow path of a hydraulic fluid and that can be connected to an electrical contact, is established in DE 197 17 422 A1.<br>
The objective of the invention is to develop a gear box further in order to make the same more compact and more cost-effective.<br>
The objective is met in accordance with the invention, according to characteristics in Claim 1 for the gear box, and in accordance with characteristics specified in Claims 10, 11 or 12 for the gear box production series.<br>
An important characteristic regarding the invention of a gear box with a casing and oil circuit pipe work, is that the transmission case at least partially forms a casing for the oil circuit pipe work. The oil circuit pipe work is, consequently, protected against damage by the transmission case and a compact gear unit is made available. No oil pipes are present in the outer region around the gear box in particular, which are, consequently, also not damageable. Place available in the interior of the gear box, said place resulting in a box-like outer shape of the gear box due to practical considerations, can thus be used to supply and distribute the lubricating agent to rotating parts in the interior of the gear box. Rotating parts comprise gear teeth, shafts, bearing journals and many other parts of a similar nature. Oil can be used to advantage as a lubricating agent. An oil sump, from which the oil circuit is supplied, is provided for the oil in the interior of the transmission case. The pipe work conducts oil taken from the oil sump to the rotating parts from where the oil flows back into the oil sump. An oil container, located outside the transmission case is, thus, dispensable as is interception of oil at the rotating parts and returning of oil to a storage container.<br><br>
In an advantageous design, the case comprises an upper case part and a (ower case part, whereby an intake pipe of the oil circuit is located at the upper case part and a pressure pipe is located at the lower case part. Upper and lower, hereby, relate to the gravitational field of the Earth and the operating position of the gear box. The two-part design of the transmission case facilitates simple opening and closing with regard to maintenance of gear box components. Of particular advantage with regard to the arrangement of the intake pipe at the upper case part is, that when opening the gear box and removing the upper case part, only the sturdy and simple intake pipe, and not the delicate remaining pipes, has to be moved by applying pressure on the same. Consequently, gear box maintenance can be implemented with a reduced danger of mistakes.<br>
In an advantageous design, the lower case part is a lower case shell and the upper case part is an upper case shell. The particular advantage in this case is that the lower case shell can be used as a receptacle for the oil sump that does not have to be pumped out or discharged when opening the case. This reduces time consumption during maintenance. Furthermore, the advantage with the design of the upper case part as a case shell is that the dividing line of the case parts can be provided approximately in the centre and can run through the bearing journal of the transmission shaft, which simplifies assembly of the shaft.<br>
In the case of an advantageous design, the oil sump of the oil circuit is located in the lower case part, the open end of the intake pipe extending into the oil circuit. The oil storage container can, thus, be advantageously omitted.<br>
The intake pipe and the pressure pipe are connected, in an advantageous design, to an oil pump to form an oil circuit, whereby the pump can be directly<br><br>
activated by means of a transmission shaft, especially the driving shaft. The advantage, thereby, is that a separate drive mechanism for a pump required to circulate the oil can be omitted. A lower failure rate of the pump and, therev^/ith, of the gear box can thus be achieved. Furthermore, an electrical supply connection for the gear box can be omitted.<br>
The lubricating oil pump is preferably connected to a distributor to which at least one first sensor is connected. The compact unit comprising the distributor and pump with sensor is a robust one.<br>
In an advantageous design, the pump is connected to a case cover of the gear box and the latter to the case of the gear box, whereby the intake pipe and the pressure pipe, running through the case cover, are connected to the pump. The advantage hereby, on the one hand is, that even the connecting pipe of the pump can be provided in the interior of the gear box - in this case, in the interior of the case wall - and, on the other hand is, that the pump's drive mechanism can be operated in a mechanically simple manner, namely, directly from the transmission shaft to the pump's shaft. The unit comprising the gear box and pump with pipe work is, thus, designed to be robust and is suitable for use in rough environmental conditions.<br>
In the case of an advantageous design, the case cover is connected at the upper case part and at the lower case part of the gear box.. The advantage hereby is that the intake and pressure pipes of the pipe work can be located in different case parts and can be simply and securely connected by the case cover to the pump, especially in a leak-proof manner, and safe from function-impeding damage.<br><br>
In an advantageous design, a pipe work distributor that is covered by the pipe work is provided in the lower case part, a pressure pipe and at least one supply pipe being connected to the pipe work distributor, whereby at least one bearing journal and/or a pinion gear can be supplied with oil for lubrication via the supply pipe. The advantage thereby is that a plurality of rotating parts in the interior of the gear box can be supplied with the lubricating agent through a pump.<br>
In an advantageous design, at least one supply pipe is connected to the pipe work distributor, the supply pipe exhibiting a nozzle at that end that is turned away from the pipe work distributor. Oil for lubrication can be supplied to the gear pinion through the nozzle, especially in the area of the gear pair's engagement. The advantage, thereby, is an easily produced and effective supply of the lubricating agent to the gear pair.<br>
Important characteristics regarding the invention pertaining to a gear box production series are that variants are included, whereby in a first variant, a lubricating oil pump is provided at a cover of a transmission case, whereby the cover covers a bearing journal of a transmission shaft, especially of the driving shaft, and the pump is connected to a pipe work system in the gear box interior by a cover, that is, connected to an oil circuit pipe work, and whereby in a second variant, a lubricating oil pump, which is structurally identical to the lubricating oil pump of the first variant, is provided at a cover of the transmission case, whereby the lubricating oil pump is connected to a partially external pipe work system, especially whereby the external pipe work system comprises an oil filter and/or an oil cooler and/or is connected to an internal pipe work system. The word 'internal' here and in the remainder of the document refers to the areas located within the transmission case or in the case walls, while 'external' refers to the spatial complement of the same. The advantage with the invention is that a production series is made available with<br><br>
a reduced diversity of parts and with the merits of the invention of a gear box with oil circuit pipe work, whereby, depending upon the user's wish or area of application, a pipe work system that is at least partially external can be provided, for example, to connect the circuit to a filter or to an oil cooler.<br>
The terms 'internal' and 'external' refer to the transmission case: the external pipe work is located outside the case, while the internal pipe work is located in the interior of the gear box or in the case walls,<br>
Important characteristics of an alternative design of the gear box production series are that variants are provided, whereby a lubricating oil pump Is located at a first end of the transmission shaft and is driven by the transmission shaft in a first variant, and the lubricating oil pump is located at the second end of the transmission shaft and is driven by this transmission shaft in a second variant, whereby the lubricating oil pumps are respectively connected to a pipe work system for lubricating oil in the interior of the gear box. Variants in which the pump of the oil circuit can be assembled at different sides of the gear box depending on the structural shape, i.e., the location of the gear box in the operating position in the gravitational field of the Earth or of other planets, are made available in this manner. For this purpose, case parts have symmetric, particularly mirror-symmetric, connecting and transmitting agents to form the oil circuit more or less in the sense of pump transfer.<br>
Important characteristics of an alternative design regarding the invention of the gear box production series are that variants are provided, whereby in a first variant the transmission case is executed in a mono block design, and in an at least two-part design in a second variant of the transmission case, whereby an internal oil circuit pipe work is provided in both variants and whereby the transmission case of both variants are designed to be essentially Identical.<br><br>
The advantage thereby is that a plurality of processing and assembly steps can be executed in the same manner for both variants, which reduces time consumption and saves on manufacturing tools.<br>
Another advantageous design of the production series comprises variants that result from combinations of existing variants. Thus, pumps with internal or external pipe work can be set up at various sides of the gear box, or gear boxes with external pipe work and without pipe work, or gear boxes with internal pipe work and separate, or by a pump driven by a transmission shaft via an intermediate gear box.<br>
The pump is preferably provided with a first sensor that is designed as a flow controller. This facilitates monitoring of the functional efficiency of the pump.<br>
A filter and a second sensor, particularly for filter monitoring, are connected alternatively or additionally. Oil can be cleaned when flowing through the filter and the cleaning capacity of the filter can be monitored. Clogging of the filter can, in particular, be detected.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, the pump is connected with its pump flange at the gear box. The advantage, hereby, is that a flange is provided at which the pump case of varying lengths, can be placed. An interface that facilitates a high variance of pumps while using the same flange, is created in this manner.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, the pump with its intake pipe and at least one pressure outlet is connected to the pipe work system provided in the interior of the gear box.    The advantage hereby is that the pump can suck in the<br><br>
lubricating oil and can press the same into the pipe work system at the pressure outlet, The pipe work system then conducts the oil, particularly by means of the pipe distributor, to the desired areas, especially lubricating points.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, a sensor is connected by means of an electric cable to an electronic circuit, especially to evaluate sensor signals. The advantage thereby is that signal evaluation can take place in a protected environment such as an electric control cabinet.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, pumps of different length can be connected axially at the pump flange, the advantage being that a series of pumps can be implemented.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, the pump is driven by a shaft of the gear box, particularly the driving shaft or the first intermediate shaft. The advantage hereby is that the pump does not require its own drive mechanism, i.e., it is passive and also moves lubricating oil only during gear box operation.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, the pump has two pressure outlets that are located symmetrically in such a manner that when assembling the pump on the opposite side of the gear box, the respective other pressure outlet is provided for connection to the pipe work system provided in the gear box interior, whereby the other pressure outlet is closed. The advantage here is that, especially in the case of an 180° symmetry, the heights of the intake and pressure connections remain the same even when using the pump on the opposite side and, consequently, the pipe work system has to be modified only marginally.<br><br>
other advantages emanate from the sub claims and the invention is not restricted to the combination of characteristics. The expert will be able to recognise other expedient combination possibilities of claims and/or individual claim characteristics and/or characteristics of the description and/or of the figures, especially from the job definition and/or the job that arises based on a comparison with prior art.<br><br>

The invention will now be described in greater detail by means of figures.<br>

Figure 3 illustrates a lubricating oil pump with pump flange and filter.<br>
Figure 4 is a partial, magnified illustration of the lubricating oil pump presented in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 5 presents various designs of the lubricating oil pump illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 6 is a graphical diagram of a gear box with lubricating oil pump and oil circuit pipe work.<br>
A system, in accordance with the invention, is symbolically presented in Figure 2. An illustrated gear box system is presented in Figure 1.<br>
It is an advantage that no oil pipes are to be provided around the system in the outer region of the gear box because the system will be housed under a gear box cover 16 and, connected to the pipe work of the gear box interior, is connected through this case cover 16.<br>
The system is illustrated in Figure 2. Pump 1 is assembled at case cover 21 of a transmission case. Pump 1 sucks in oil at its intake connection via bore 22 and presses same out at its pressure outlet via bore 23 back into the gear box interior.    The distributor flange 4 provided at pump 1  renders other outer<br><br>
pressure pipes superfluous and facilitates direct connection of sensors and filters. Pump 1 is connected to a transmission shaft 24 that drives pump 1 through bore 25 in case cover 21 Not shown here are two pins, pointing in an axial direction, and located at a diameter of the shaft at the end face of the pump shaft. These pins mesh with correspondingly designed bores in the transmission shaft 24, therewith producing positive locking with which to drive pump 1.<br>
A first sensor 2 and a second sensor 3 are provided in particular, whereby the first is designed as a flow controller, for example, and the second as a filter monitor that monitors the functional efficiency of filter 5, also connected to the distributor flange 4. The second sensor 3 issues a signal at a connected electronic circuit as the filter gets increasingly clogged.<br>
Sensor 3 compares the pressure of oil flowing into filter 5 with pressure of oil flowing out of the same. A signal will be issued or the value communicated if the pressure difference exceeds a critical value. Alternatively, the value will be constantly measured and notified to a superordinated electronic circuit at regular intervals.<br>
Sensor 2 detects the flow rate and communicates the value to a superordinated electronic circuit or issues a signal if the flow rate falls below a critical value.<br>
The parts mentioned in Figure 2 are illustrated in Figure 1 and connected to a gear box.<br><br>
Pump 10 is thus executed as a compact unit and can be connected directly to a gear box. External pipes that could be damaged, are omitted.<br>
A first sensor 14 and second sensor 13 are provided at the distributor flange 11 at which filter 12 is also provided. Gear box 15 has a case cover 16 in which the system can be built. In contrast to Figure 2, distributor flange 11, sensors (13, 14) and filter 12 are located at approximately one level that runs parallel to the case wall.<br>
Devices are provided in other exemplary embodiments in the form of sensors that function according to other principles of measurement, in accordance with the invention.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments in accordance with the invention, only the sensors are connected by means of electric cables to respective signal-conditioning circuitry that is provided away from the gear box, for example, in an electric control cabinet.<br>
Figure 3 presents another design in accordance with the invention. Pump 30 is connected to a pump flange 32 by a flange plate 31. The pump flange is affixed to a case cover that is not illustrated here. Case of pump 30 has a first external pressure connection 34a, a second external pressure connection 34b, an external intake connection 36 and an exhaust bore hole 38 that are respectively closed by screws. A pump cover 49 closes pump 30 in an axial direction.<br><br>
The terms 'external' and 'internal' refer here to the possibility of a connection to an external pipe, i.e., a pipe situated outside a gear box and/or to an internal pipe, i.e., one located within a gear box or in the case wall.<br>
Pump 30 is connected to distributor 39 at which filter 40, a connection for filter monitoring 42, and a sensor connection 44 for a flow controller are placed. An oil drain plug 46 closes an oil drain hole. Another oil drain plug 48 is provided at filter 40.<br>
Figure 4 is another view of the same exemplary embodiment In a partially magnified illustration. Pump shaft 50 of pump 30 is connected, in an assembled state, through bore 52 to a transmission shaft. This transmission shaft is preferably the driving transmission shaft.<br>
Flange plate 31 has an Internal intake connection 54, a first internal pressure connection 56a and a second internal pressure connection 56b. Internal intake connection 54 is covered by a bore when placing the flange plate 31 at the pump flange 32, said bore ending in a transfer duct 58. The first internal pressure connection 56a is covered by a bore when placing the flange plate 31 at the case cover 32, said bore ending in a transfer duct 60. The second internal pressure connection 56b is closed tightly by the pump flange 32 when placing the flange plate 31 at the pump flange 32. Pump flange 32 is assembled on a gear box cover that is not illustrated. Transfer ducts (58, 60) end through this in an oil circuit pipe work whose ends are rolled into bores that are compatible with transfer ducts (58, 60).<br>
Transfer ducts (58, 60) can, thus, be connected to connections of an internal pipe work in the transmission case. One and the same pump flange 32 can be<br><br>
assembted on different transmission cases, especially different gear box covers that can be differentiated by the relative distance of the pipe work connections due to the elongated design of the transfer ducts (58, 60). In this manner, one and the same pump flange can be used for different gear box sizes, v/hich are different from one another especially regarding their bearing journal diameter.<br>
Fastening screws 62 secure flange plate 31 relative to the pump flange 32, against twisting, and fix pump 30 on pump flange 32.<br>
Pump flange 32 can be connected by means of screws to the transmission case through screw holes 64.<br>
An oil circuit that runs at least partially outside the transmission case can be connected through an external intake connection 36 and a first external pressure connection 34a. This type of external connection is especially necessary if additional oil cooling is required. Locking screws, illustrated in Figure 3, are respectively removed when connecting an external pipe.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the principle of dual-sided assembly of the shaft pump with filter. The transmission case is to be located, theoretically, in the intermediate space 72 between the pump flange in the first design 32a and the pump flange in the second design 32b.<br>
The orientation of two axes, preferably one over the other vertically, mathematically conceived, located in an object In the operating position with regard to the homogenously-approximated gravitational field of the Earth,' is<br><br>
understood in this document when referring to the design of an object. For example, these types of axes are determined in a gear box by the dfrection of the driving shaft and an axis that is vertical to this and to a case wall. These types of axes in the case of a pump with a filter according to Figure 3 are, for example, determined by the direction of the pump shaft and the axis of symmetry of the filter.<br>
Pump 70a, in a first design, Is connected in such a manner to pump flange 32a that a first transfer duct 58 in pump flange 32a is connected to the internal intake connection 54 of pump 70a, the second transfer duct 60 in the case cover 32a to the first internal pressure connection 56a and that the second internal pressure connection 56b is tightly closed by case cover 32a.<br>
Pump 70b, in a second design, is connected in such a manner to pump flange 32b that the second transfer duct 60 in pump flange 32b is connected to the internal intake connection 54 of pump 70a, the first transfer duct 58 in pump flange 32a to the second internal pressure connection 56b and that the first internal pressure connection 56a is tightly closed by pump flange 32b.<br>
Transfer ducts (58„60) are each connected to a connection pipe of the gear box's internal pipe work.<br>
Intake connection 54 is connected in this manner In both designs having the same pump flange (32a, 32b) and the same pump (70a, 70b), to the upper connection pipe of the internal pipe work with regard to the gravitational field of the Earth 80. Different designs can, thus, be made available with a reduced assortment of parts.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 4, pump 30 also has a second external pressure connection 34b, which Is used during pump 30 assembly in a second design and with at least partial external pipe work and, in fact, in a corresponding manner as shown In Figure 5. This, thus, corresponds, for example, to use of the first external pressure connection 34a in Figure 4, use of the first internal pressure connection 56a In Figure 5, use of the second external pressure connection 34b in Figure 4, use of the second internal pressure connection 56b in Figure 5, use of the external intake connection 36 In Figure 4, use of the internal intake connection 54 in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment of a gear box, in accordance with the Invention, with a shaft pump and internal pipe work.<br>
The transmission case comprises a first case part 601 and a second case part 602. The gear box comprises a first shaft 603, a second shaft 604 and a third shaft 605, on which, as shown, a first gear pinion 610, a second gear pinion 611, a third gear pinion 612 and a fourth gear pinion 613 are provided. The shafts are fastened and/or supported by a first bearing journal 606, a second bearing journal 607, a third bearing journal 608 and a fourth bearing journal 609.<br>
The arrangement of shafts, gear pinions and bearing journals relative to one another and with reference to case parts (601, 602) is only schematically illustrated for the purpose of clarity regarding the functional principle. The expert can, as a matter of routine, if required, design other bearing journals that are not illustrated and other gear pinions and other shafts and/or provide these in other configurations in order to furnish other exemplary embodiments in accordance with the invention.<br><br>
The first shaft 603 in Figure 6 is a driving shaft of the gear box.<br>
Pump 620, which is driven by shaft 603, is assembled at the first shaft 603. Pump 620 is designed as a shaft pump and serves as an oil circulating pump.<br>
Pump 620 is connected to intake pipe 621, which projects into the oil sump<br>
622.	Pump 620 is connected to a pipe work distributor 624 by a pressure pipe<br>
623.	Pump 620, which Is driven by the first shaft 603, thus pumps oil out from oil sump 622 to the pipe work distributor 624.<br>
Pipe work distributor 624 is connected to at least one first supply pipe 625, a second supply 626 and a third supply pipe 627 through which oil that is pumped to the pipe work distributor 624 Is conducted further.<br>
The pipe work distributor 624 Is also provided to distribute oil.<br>
The first supply pipe 625 ends in the third bearing journal 608 through which oil Is made available to lubricate the third bearing journal 608.<br>
The second supply pipe 626 ends in a nozzle 628 through which oi! is injected when the first gear pinion 610 and second gear pinion 611 engage.<br>
The third supply pipe 627 ends in the first bearing journal 606 that is fixed in the transmission case. The first bearing journal 606 is thus lubricated by the third supply line 627.<br><br>
other supply pipes are provided but not illustrated for purposes of clarity. The third shaft 605, fourth bearing journal 609 and fourth gear pinion 613 are respectively partially immersed in oil sump 622. The parts mentioned (605, 609, 613) are thus supplied with lubricating oil directly from oil sump 622. The fourth gear pinion 613 supplies the third gear pinion 612 with lubrication oil from oil sump 622 during common engagement.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 5, the entire pipe work for oil lubrication is located in the transmission case and, therewith, protected against inadvertent damage, on the one hand, while on the other hand, the upper case shell 601 can be removed without having to disassemble the damageable part of the pipe work that is loaded with pressure, comprising at least pressure pipe 623, pipe work distributor 624 and supply pipes (625, 626, 627). In particular, the simply and sturdily designed intake pipe 621 has to, at the most, be re¬adjusted manually after removing the upper case shell 601.<br>
The transmission case is designed as a mono block version in another exemplary embodiment, i.e., as a single piece. The arrangement of bores for the shafts or pipe work connections or other ducts and/or assembly points are advantageously selected identical to the variant with the divided case. Consequently, the transmission case of the mono block variant and the two-part variant described above are essentially identical. Both cases can be differentiated only in the details that are directly connected with a two-part design such as, for example, an interface with bores for screws, sealing agents etc. Many of the production and service steps can, therefore, be executed similarly for both variants.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments, in accordance with the invention, the pump has an intake connection and two pressure outlets, whereby the outlets are<br><br>
located symmetric to the pump axis. The gear box cover together with the system can, therefore, be provided on the opposite side of the gear box and, the other outlet can thereby be provided for the pipe work provided in the interior of the gear box. The pipe work has, therefore, only to be' modified marginally and assembly can take place in the same manner. The same cover with the system can thus be used again at the gear box.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments in accordance with the invention, the pump has a flange in the direction of the gear box and can be replaced by another pump that can be assembled at the same flange. Different pumps, especially those with different axial lengths, are feasible in this manner. Thus, a larger or a smaller pump can be connected depending upon the speed of the shaft driving the pump or depending upon on the flow rate required.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments in accordance with the invention, the pump is connected and driven by the driving shaft or the first intermediate shaft of the gear box. Thus, only a small pump is required since the speed of the pump ts high.<br>
Other fluid lubricating materials are also understood by the term 'oil' in connection with the invention such as, lubricating grease, the viscosity of which, at operating temperature, matches that of a fluid and can, therefore, be pumped.<br>
Other advantages emanate from the sub claims. The invention is not restricted to the combination characteristics of claims. The expert will be able to recognise other expedient combination possibilities of claims and/or individual claim characteristics and/or characteristics of the description and/or of the<br><br>
figures, especially from the job definition and/or the job that arises based on a comparison with prior art.<br><br><br>
