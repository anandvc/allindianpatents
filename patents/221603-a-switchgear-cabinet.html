[Section 10 Rule 13]<br>
"A SWITCHGEAR CABINET"<br>
RITTAL-WERK RUDOLF LOH GMBH &amp; CO. KG, Auf dem Stutzelberg, D-35745 Herborn, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br>
WO 99/40659	PCT/EP98/08450<br>
Control Cabinet<br>
The invention relates to a switchgear cabinet with a cabinet body, the open sides of whose body can be closed off at least partially by means of one or several lateral walls, wherein an airconditioning unit is arranged in the area of at least one lateral wall, through which heat can be removed from or supplied to this cabinet body.<br>
Such a cabinet body is known from DE 41 35 894 C1.  As the airconditioning unit, this switchgear cabinet has a cooling unit having fans and heat exchangers.  The cooling unit is arranged in a housing, which has been inserted into a cutout in a vertical lateral wall.  In order to be able to retrofit an existing switchgear cabinet with the cooling unit, it is necessary to rework the appropriate lateral wall, or respectively to install a new one.<br>
An airconditioning arrangement is known from DE 43 13 022, which has been installed on the exterior of the lateral wall.  The lateral wall is provided with appropriate openings for providing a spatial connection with the interior of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
DE 37 10 566 C2 describes an airconditioning unit, which is placed on the lateral wall which is embodied as a sheet metal cover.  It is necessary in a manner similar to DE 43 13 022 to cut out openings from the sheet metal cover.<br>
It is the object of the invention to create a switchgear cabinet of the type mentioned at the outset, which can be equipped with an airconditioning unit in a simple way.<br><br><br>
WO 99/40659<br><br>
PCT/EP98/08450<br><br>
This object is attained in that an intermediate wall is arranged parallel and spaced apart from the lateral wall and facing the interior of the cabinet body, and that the airconditioning unit is arranged in the space enclosed by the lateral wall and the intermediate wall.<br>
With this design in accordance with the invention of a switchgear cabinet, the lateral wall becomes a part of the airconditioning unit, so that the outlay for parts can be considerably reduced.  The outer geometry of the switchgear cabinet is not changed by the installation of the airconditioning unit which, for one, offers advantages in appearance. Furthermore, it is possible because of this to take limited space conditions in the surroundings of the switchgear cabinet into consideration.  Because the cooling device is associated with the lateral wall it is also possible to exchange heat energy with the environment directly through the area of the lateral wall.  This results in good efficiency of the cooling device.<br>
It is provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment variation of the invention that the cabinet body has a rack composed of vertical profiled frame sections and horizontal depth and width struts, that the intermediate wall and the lateral wall are fastened to the rack, and that the width of the intermediate space extending vertically in respect to the lateral wall is equal to or less than the corresponding vertical profiled frame sections or the depth, or respectively width struts.  The airconditioning unit designed in this way hardly reduces the interior of the switchgear cabinet, so that the installation space for built-ins is only slightly reduced.  In particular, the vertical profiled<br><br>
WO 99/40659<br><br>
PCT/EP98/08450<br><br>
frame sections can still be used as attachment points for built-ins.<br>
For example, the airconditioning unit can be designed as a heat exchanger.  In that case the intermediate wall is provided with one or several openings, through which air from the interior of the switchgear cabinet is conducted to the heat exchanger. Thereafter, the conditioned air can again be returned into the interior of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
In this case it can be provided in particular that the heat exchanger has a conduit system arranged in a meander shape, through which coolant is conducted and whose cooling surfaces face the intermediate space formed between the intermediate and the lateral walls, and that the conduit system is connected via connecting elements to a supply unit arranged outside of the switchgear cabinet.  Effective cooling of the air can take place against the meander-shaped conduit system.  The conduit sections of the conduit system which are arranged crosswise to the flow direction are preferably arranged offset from each other vertically in relation to the lateral wall.  The flowing air is deflected several times by this simple step, so that an optimal flow around the conduit sections is achieved.<br>
A possible variation of the invention is distinguished in that the vertical intermediate wall is provided in its upper area with the openings embodied as inlet openings, and that the intermediate wall supports one or several fans in its lower area, which draw the air out of the intermediate space and return it into the interior of the cabinet body.  Air then flows again back into the intermediate space through the inlet openings.<br><br><br>
WO 99/40659<br><br>
PCT/EP98/08450<br><br>
Here it can be provided in accordance with a preferred variation of the invention that the intermediate wall has two or more rows of openings, and that the openings are arranged symmetrically in respect to center transverse axis and center longitudinal axis extending in the plane of the intermediate wall. For one, a simplification of mounting is achieved by this, and it is furthermore possible to achieve an even air flow and guidance in many variations by means of the even distribution of the openings.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail in what follows by means of an exemplary embodiment represented in the drawings.  The drawings show a rack of a switchgear cabinet in a partial representation and a perspective lateral view.  The rack has a bottom frame and a top frame.  These are composed of horizontal depth and width struts 11 and 12.  The bottom frame is connected by means of vertical profiled frame sections 10 with the top frame.  Both the vertical profiled frame sections 10 and the depth and width struts 11 and 12 have been provided with fastening receivers 13 spaced apart at even distances from each other.<br>
The rack can be enclosed by vertical and horizontal lateral walls 14 and at least one cabinet door.  As a rule, the lateral wall are made of sheet steel and therefore have good heat conductivity.<br>
Only one lateral wall 14 is represented in the drawings for reasons of clarity.  An intermediate wall 20 is arranged parallel with it and faces the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  The intermediate wall 20 can be screwed with its vertical edges 28 to the fastening receivers 13 of the vertical profiled frame sections 28 (fastening screws 21).  An air collection channel is formed<br><br>
WO 99/40659<br><br>
PCT/EP98/08450<br><br>
between the lateral wall 14 and the intermediate wall 20.  An airconditioning unit, embodied as a heat exchanger, has been installed in this air collection channel, which is constituted in the present case by a fluid conduit conducted in a meander shape. The fluid conduit is conducted out of the air collection channel through the lateral wall 14 by means of two conduit elements.  It can be connected there to a cooling system via connecting elements 23, 24.  The air collection channel is spatially connected via openings 25 in the intermediate wall 20 with the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  In this case the openings 25 are arranged in horizontally extending rows, which are arranged in different horizontal planes.  One row is arranged in the upper roof area, one in the lower bottom area and a third in the center area of the intermediate wall 20.  Preferably the intermediate wall 20 is constructed symmetrically, so that a simplification of mounting can be achieved.  The openings 25 can be selectively closed off by means of cover plates 27.  In the exemplary embodiment the openings 25 of the center row are closed off.  The cover plates 27 are provided with hook elements 21a for their attachment, which can be hung in the lower horizontal edge of the openings 25.  The cover plates 25 can then be screwed to the intermediate wall (20) in the area of the upper horizontal edge.<br>
Fans 32 are arranged on the lower openings 25.  These have been screwed to adapters 30, which can be fixed in place on the opening 25 by means of a fastening plate 31.<br>
The fans 32 draw air out of the air collection channel and give it off into the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  At the same time heated air flows out of the roof area of the switchgear cabinet through the upper openings 25 into the air collection<br><br>
WO 99/40659<br><br>
PCT/EP98/08450<br><br>
channel.  The heated air is passed along the airconditioning unit 22, where it is cooled.  The horizontal conduit sections are here preferably arranged offset from each other crosswise to the flow direction.  The air can then flow around them, so that an effective use of the cooling output becomes possible.  After the airconditioning unit 22, the cooled air is again supplied to the interior of the switchgear cabinet by means of the fans 32.<br>
The lateral wall 14 is used as an additional heat exchanger, through which a heat exchange with the surroundings over a large surface is possible.  A high degree of efficiency can be achieved by means of the airconditioning unit 22 in this way.<br>
The invention is not only limited to the exemplary embodiment represented in the drawings.  It would also be conceivable to install the airconditioning unit between the center and lower rows of openings 25.  Moreover, a further airconditioning unit 22 can also be additionally installed.<br>
It is also conceivable to install the fans 32 at the upper openings 25, wherein they then blow air out of the interior of the switchgear cabinet into the air collection channel.<br>
A variety of course for the flow are possible because of the arrangement of the openings 25, so that a directed conditioning of the interior of the switchgear cabinet becomes possible.<br>
If a switchgear cabinet is set up in cold surroundings, the airconditioning unit of the invention can also be employed for heating the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  In this case a heating coil, for example, is the installed in the air collection channel.<br><br>
