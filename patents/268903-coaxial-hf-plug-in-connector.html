				<td>Coaxial HF plug-in connector<br>
The invention relates to a coaxial HF plug-in connector<br>
according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Coaxial HF plug-in connectors are used widely in<br>
electrical engineering. A common application is in this<br>
regard the use of coaxial plug-in connectors of this type<br>
as an interface to housings for the connection of coaxial<br>
lines to which high-frequency useful signals (HF signals)<br>
are transmitted.<br>
However, in many uses, not only high-frequency useful<br>
signals but also low-frequency control signals and/or a DC<br>
voltage, for example for supplying power to the devices<br>
connected thereby, are transmitted via the same coaxial<br>
lines. One of these applications is, for example, the<br>
powering of head points, satellite reception equipment,<br>
etc.<br>
It is therefore known to provide in the transmission path<br>
corresponding branch means via which the high-frequency<br>
useful signals (HF signals) can be separated from a DC<br>
voltage component or a low-frequency control signal (LF<br>
signal). This is frequently carried out by the<br>
interposition of capacitors or capacitor means via which<br>
the high-frequency useful signals can be transmitted,<br>
whereas the DC voltage component and/or the low-frequency<br>
control signals are decoupled.<br>
However, a means of this type requires additional modules<br>
which are generally accommodated so as also to be<br>
integrated in a separate housing or in a separate chamber<br><br>
2<br>
in a housing of a subsequent device used to process<br>
signals.<br>
A generic coaxial connector has become known, for example,<br>
from US 4,575,694. In an HF plug-in connector known<br>
therefrom, a hole is provided in the external conductor<br>
material so as to provide a switchable terminating<br>
impedance at this location.<br>
EP 0 129 820 A2 can also be taken to disclose as known a<br>
coupling element for connecting a signal transmission<br>
means to a coaxial main line. This element is a capacitive<br>
coupling element for connecting a signal transmission<br>
means to a coaxial main line. There is provided in this<br>
case a coaxial tap using a coaxial segment of the external<br>
conductor.<br>
Finally, DE 102 08 402 Al discloses in principle that<br>
electrical components can also be arranged in a<br>
dielectric.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to<br>
provide an improved coaxial HF plug-in connector allowing<br>
compact decoupling of low-frequency control signals and/or<br>
DC voltage components from a high-frequency useful signal.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved in<br>
accordance with the features specified in Claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are specified<br>
in the sub-claims.<br>
The solution according to the invention is distinguished<br>
by its compactness and by its varied possible uses.<br><br>
3<br>
That is to say, according to the invention, it is now<br>
provided that the corresponding separating means for the<br>
separation of high-frequency useful signals from lowfrequency<br>
control signals and/or a remote supply voltage<br>
(DC voltage component) is accommodated in the coaxial<br>
plug-in connector itself.<br>
The coaxial plug-in connector has in this case on the<br>
connection side, like conventional coaxial plug-in<br>
connectors, an external conductor and also an internal<br>
conductor held apart by a dielectric. However, in<br>
addition, the contact plug-in connector according to the<br>
invention now comprises a branch circuit having an HF<br>
internal conductor on which the high-frequency signals are<br>
further transmitted and an LF internal conductor on which<br>
the low-frequency control signals and/or the DC voltage<br>
component for the remote supply voltage which may be<br>
required are decoupled.<br>
According to the invention, this is carried out by a /4<br>
balun.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, this balun is<br>
accommodated in a corresponding hole in the plug-in<br>
connector external conductor, thus further improving the<br>
HF signal attenuation.<br>
It has proven beneficial to configure the branch circuit<br>
in such a way that the HF internal conductor and the LF<br>
internal conductor extend parallel to each other. However,<br>
an at least slightly diverging orientation is also<br>
possible, the angle preferably being less than ± 10°, in<br>
particular less than ± 5°, between the two branch lines.<br><br>
4<br>
According to the present invention, the HF signal<br>
conductor is preferably forwarded in the axial extension<br>
of the plug-in connector internal conductor and the LF<br>
internal conductor arranged in the coaxial connector on<br>
the output side, as a branch line offset radially relative<br>
to the HF signal conductor. In principle, however, an<br>
inverse configuration is also possible. Finally, it is in<br>
principle even conceivable for the branch circuit to be<br>
configured in such a way that the two line branches,<br>
extending preferably parallel to each other, for the HF<br>
and the LF signals both to be positioned so as to be<br>
offset radially relative to the connector-side coaxial<br>
internal conductor.<br>
The entire arrangement can be configured in such a way<br>
that the pre-assembled plug-in connector internal<br>
conductor having the attached dielectric and the branch<br>
arrangement consisting of the HF internal conductor and<br>
the LF internal conductor having the associated balun can<br>
be introduced from the connector side into the external<br>
conductor and assembled. However, the entire arrangement<br>
can also be configured and designed in such a way that a<br>
corresponding assembly is possible from the opposing side<br>
or that the plug-in connector components are assembled on<br>
both sides.<br>
Depending on the specific application, it is also<br>
possible, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, to<br>
use in the plug-in connector a plurality of baluns of <br>
differing lengths. This allows adaptation to the<br>
respective HF frequency range to be transmitted and the<br>
desired locking effect and attenuation to be carried out.<br><br>
5<br>
The presentation of the invention reveals that the<br>
omission of a specific housing or a specific chamber in a<br>
housing and the accommodation of the branch means,<br>
including the associated attenuation means, in the plug-in<br>
connector allows a considerable amount of space to be<br>
saved. It is particularly surprising in this regard that<br>
this ultimately does not lead or does not have to lead to<br>
enlargement or relevant enlargement of the plug-in<br>
connector. In addition, the plug-in connector according to<br>
the invention can be manufactured extremely economically<br>
as, in contrast to conventional plug-in connectors, an<br>
additional hole is required merely in the external<br>
conductor.<br>
Further advantages, details and features of the invention<br>

7<br>
Fig. 7 shows a coaxial plug-in connector according to the<br>
invention having, compared to the view according to Fig.<br>
1, a decoupling unit (23) having a larger external<br>
diameter.<br>
Reference will be made hereinafter to Fig. 1 which shows a<br>
first embodiment in axial cross section.<br>
Fig. 1 shows in axial section a coaxial plug-in connector<br>
1 comprising a plug-in connector external conductor 3 and,<br>
on the connector connection side (i.e. located on the<br>
left-hand side in Fig. 1) , coaxially thereto in a known<br>
manner a plug-in connector internal conductor 5 which is<br>
held via an insulator, in the illustrated embodiment a<br>
disc-shaped dielectric 7, in the external conductor 3 so<br>
as to prevent electrogalvanic contact between the internal<br>
and external conductors.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the plug-in connector<br>
internal conductor has, on the connector connection side,<br>
a sleeve-type extension 5' . However, a pin-like internal<br>
conductor connection can also be provided at this<br>
location.<br>
The coaxial plug-in connector thus formed is preferably<br>
standardised on its coaxial connection side 8, for example<br>
configured as a 7/16 connector to EN 122 190.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the standardised region on<br>
the connection side 8 in the axial extension of the plugin<br>
connector internal conductor 5 then merges with an HF<br>
internal conductor 9 via a tapering intermediate portion<br>
5".<br><br>
8<br>
As may be seen from the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
central opening or hole 12a, which is located on the<br>
connector side and in which the sleeve-type extension 5'<br>
of the coaxial plug-in connector is also arranged, merges<br>
via an intermediate hole 12b which tapers conically or in<br>
the shape of a truncated cone with an outlet-side axial<br>
hole 12c in which the HF internal conductor 9 is<br>
positioned so as to be set apart from the walls of the<br>
plug-in connector external conductor 3.<br>
The transitions from the plug-in connector internal<br>
conductor 5 to the HF internal conductor 9 and also from<br>
the hole 12a to the hole 12c do not have to extend<br>
continuously as in the embodiment. Abrupt changes in<br>
diameter between the portions are also possible.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the HF internal conductor 9<br>
ends before the end-face external conductor end 10 where,<br>
extending in the radial direction, a coaxial connection<br>
cable 13 forwarding the HF signals (high-frequency<br>
signals) is connected in the plug-in connector external<br>
conductor 3 via a radial hole 15. For this purpose, the<br>
coaxial connection cable 13 is stripped in a<br>
correspondingly stepped manner at its connection end; the<br>
associated internal conductor 13a is guided through the HF<br>
internal conductor 9, through a preferably groove-like<br>
aperture therein, and is soldered to said HF internal<br>
conductor 9. The dielectric 13c surrounding the internal<br>
conductor 13a insulates the internal conductor from the<br>
plug-in connector external conductor and is introduced for<br>
this purpose into the radial hole 15. The end face and/or<br>
the circumferential portion of the stepped external<br>
conductor 13b is electrogalvanically contacted at the end<br><br>
9<br>
face of the sleeve-type connection portion 17 which is<br>
part of the plug-in connector external conductor 3.<br>
Reference numeral 13d denotes the outer insulation of the<br>
coaxial connection cable 13.<br>
Via the plug-in connector internal conductor 5, and thus<br>
via the HF internal conductor 9 pertaining to the plug-in<br>
connector internal conductor 5, high-frequency signals (HF<br>
signals) are therefore forwarded on the output side from<br>
the coaxial connection side 8 to the connected coaxial<br>
cable 13.<br>
If there is then connected to the coaxial connector of<br>
this type, on the connection side, a coaxial cable via<br>
which not only HF signals (i.e. high-frequency useful<br>
signals) but also LF signals (for example, low-frequency<br>
control signals and/or a remote supply voltage or DC<br>
voltage) are transmitted, these are to be decoupled via a<br>
decoupling branch by means of the coaxial plug-in<br>
connector according to the invention. This therefore means<br>
that the uncoupling in the decoupling branch should be as<br>
large as possible for the frequency range of the HF<br>
signal.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, there is then formed in the<br>
material of the plug-in connector external conductor 3,<br>
parallel to the outlet-side axial hole 12c (having a<br>
smaller diameter than the inlet-side axial hole 12a), a<br>
further hole 21 in which there is accommodated the<br>
aforementioned decoupling branch 23 consisting of the LF<br>
internal conductor 27, internal dielectric 35, balun 31<br>
and external dielectric 37. The LF internal conductor is<br>
broken down in this case into a radial portion 27a and an,<br><br>
10<br>
in the illustrated embodiment, axial portion 27b extending<br>
parallel to the HF internal conductor 9.<br>
As emerges from the schematic illustration according to<br>
Fig. 1 but also from the perspective view to be discussed<br>
hereinafter according to Fig. 3a and 3b, there is provided<br>
in the HF internal conductor 9 - although, if required,<br>
also in the transition part 5" or still further toward the<br>
connection end of the plug-in connector internal conductor<br>
5 - a radial hole 24a (Fig. 3a and 3b) in which the radial<br>
portion 27a of the LF internal conductor 27 is inserted,<br>
electrically contacted and optionally also soldered on.<br>
A balun 31 is provided on the axial portion 27b of the LF<br>
internal conductor 27. The LF internal conductor 27 of the<br>
decoupling branch 23 is soldered to the base 31b of the<br>
balun 31 at the soldering point 34. The corresponding<br>
conditions are reproduced in the enlarged detailed view in<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
If the length of the internal hole in the balun is<br><br>
wherein r is the corresponding dielectric constant of the<br>
internal dielectric 35 used and A is the central<br>
wavelength of the frequency range to be transmitted in the<br>
HF branch, preferably the central wavelength of this<br>
frequency range, the short circuit thus formed inside the<br><br>
11<br>
balun filled with plastics material or generally with a<br>
dielectric 35 is transformed at the open end of the balun<br>
into an idle state (/4 electrical length). This idle<br>
state on the open side 31c of the balun 31 is provided<br>
very close to the branch-off point 24 of the decoupling<br>
branch 23 and thus causes the HF signal to flow not into<br>
the decoupling branch 23 but rather into the HF branch and<br>
thus via the HF internal conductor 9.<br>
In principle, however, instead of a dielectric 35<br>
(internal dielectric 35) and the dielectric 37 (external<br>
dielectric 37) which is often made of plastics material,<br>
use may also be made of a dielectric made from a different<br>
material, even of air or the like.<br>
However, in order further to improve the attenuation for<br>
the HF signal in the LF decoupling branch 23, there is<br>
also formed a very slight gap between the outer lateral<br>
surface of the balun and the adjoining wall 21a,<br>
surrounding the balun, of the hole 21. This interval<br>
between the outer or circumferential surface of the balun<br>
31 and the adjoining inner wall 21a of the hole 21, in<br>
which the balun is located, is filled in the illustrated<br>
embodiment using an insulator or dielectric 37 in order<br>
reliably to prevent electrogalvanic connection.<br>
This slight gap between the outside of the balun and the<br>
housing (i.e. the external conductor of the decoupling<br>
branch) causes the. uncoupling to be further increased. The<br>
gap is limited merely by the required dielectric strength<br>
(high-voltage strength between the external and internal<br>
conductors).<br><br>
12<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the LF internal conductor<br>
thus protrudes axially, in the axial extension, from the<br>
connection end 10 of the plug-in connector housing thus<br>
formed.<br>
In terms of manufacture, the plug-in connector internal<br>
conductor 5, which is integrally connected to the HF<br>
internal conductor 9, can be attached to a disc-shaped<br>
dielectric 7 as shown in Fig. 3a. The radial LF internal<br>
conductor portion 27a of the preassembled decoupling unit<br>
23 is then inserted into the radial hole 24a in the HF<br>
internal conductor 9 (immediately adjacent to the<br>
dielectric 7), where it is soldered in accordance with the<br>
teaching that the axial distances between the HF internal<br>
conductor portion 9 and LF internal conductor portion 27b<br>
and also between the external conductor 3 and hole 21<br>
correspond.<br>
As the radial dimensions, including the external<br>
circumference of the decoupling module 23, are not larger<br>
in the illustrated embodiment than the disc-shaped<br>
dielectric 7, the arrangement can be such that the unit<br>
thus prepared and illustrated in perspective in Fig. 3b,<br>
including the decoupling branch 23, is inserted into the<br>
plug-in connector external conductor housing 3 from the<br>
coaxial connection side 8. Then, the aforementioned end of<br>
the radially supplied connection cable 13 at the radial<br>
connection portion 17 has merely to be introduced and the<br>
associated internal conductor portion and external<br>
conductor portion connected accordingly. The closure-side<br>
external conductor opening 3a can then be sealed by a<br>
closure cap 41. A corresponding coaxial plug-in connector<br>
1 without the aforementioned radially supplied connection<br><br>
13<br>
cable 17 is reproduced again in axial section in Fig. 4a<br>
and in a perspective view in Fig. 4b and 4c.<br>
In Fig. 5, a coaxial plug-in connector, described in<br>
accordance with Fig. 1, is connected to an electronics<br>
housing 43, merely the decoupled LF signals and an<br>
optionally provided DC voltage signal (remote supply<br>
signal) being fed into the electronics housing via the LF<br>
internal conductor 27, namely via an opening or hole 43a<br>
provided in the electronics housing 43. The internal<br>
conductor can in this case project so as to reach a<br>
printed circuit board 45 accommodated in the electronics<br>
housing 43 and optionally to penetrate said printed<br>
circuit board in a hole 45a, where it can be soldered.<br>
The HF signals are forwarded via the HF connection cable<br>
13.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a differing embodiment.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 6, the HF internal<br>
conductor 9 is also axially extended and protrudes beyond<br>
the connection end 10 of the plug-in connector external<br>
conductor or external conductor housing 3 and is in this<br>
case also guided into the electronics housing 43 via a<br>
further hole 43b, optionally into a second chamber 43"<br>
which is separated by a screened wall 44 from a first<br>
chamber 43' into which the LF internal conductor leads 27.<br>
If the housing 43 is manufactured by casting, the external<br>
conductor 3 can be formed in this variation in a highly<br>
cost-effective manner entirely, or at least partially, in<br>
the same production process.<br><br>
14<br>
Also different in this embodiment is the formation of the<br>
plug-in connector external conductor 3 at the connection<br>
end 10 thereof, which is provided in this case with a<br>
connection flange 3b.<br>
Fig. 6a to 6c reproduce the corresponding configuration of<br>
the external conductor, partially in axial section and<br>
partially in a perspective view with the associated<br>
connection flange 3b which, in the illustrated embodiment,<br>
is of square configuration and has in its corners four<br>
respective holes via which screws can be screwed into the<br>
electronics housing (for fastening the coaxial plug-in<br>
connector).<br>
Finally, Fig. 6b and 6c also show that there is provided<br>
at this location, in addition to the central hole 21, not<br>
only a further axial hole 21a, axially offset for the<br>
decoupling branch, but also a second, likewise parallel<br>
hole 21b. This allows, for example, the accommodation of a<br>
further, second branch line which is constructed like the<br>
first branch line 23 and connected to the HF internal<br>
conductor 9. If a plurality of branch lines is provided,<br>
the associated baluns can also differ in length, to lock<br>
differing frequency ranges. Therefore, in principle, there<br>
can even be arranged more than one balun or even more than<br>
two baluns.<br>
In contrast to the illustrated embodiment, the baluns or<br>
the branch line 27 do not in all cases have to be arranged<br>
parallel to the HF internal conductor. Both lines can also<br>
diverge or at least diverge slightly. However, if<br>
possible, a diverging angle should be less than 10°,<br>
particularly preferably less than 9°.<br><br>
15<br>
Finally, the construction could also be inverted in such a<br>
way that the LF internal conductor 27 extends in the axial<br>
extension of the plug-in connector internal conductor 5<br>
and the plug-in connector internal conductor 5 thus almost<br>
merges with the LF internal conductor 27. In this case, a<br>
first radial portion of the HF internal conductor 9 would<br>
then branch from the LF internal conductor 27 and then<br>
merge with a preferably parallel portion. This would lead<br>
almost to swapping-over of the two branches shown in<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
Finally, however, a further possibility would be a Yshaped<br>
branch in which there is provided in the immediate<br>
axial extension of the plug-in connector internal<br>
conductor 5 not a continuation but rather a double radial<br>
offset, so both the LF internal conductor and the HF<br>
internal conductor are preferably positioned parallel but<br>
radially laterally offset relative to the plug-in<br>
connector internal conductor 5.<br>
Consideration will now be given to the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 7 which differs from that according to<br>
Fig. 1 in that the decoupling means 2 3 has a larger<br>
external diameter and in that the balun ends further<br>
outward, viewed from the central axial line 51, i.e.<br>
radially further outward, so the hole 21a is not<br>
completely flush with the connection-side hole 12a but<br>
rather forms a stepped shoulder 3d in the central region.<br>
As a result, the entire arrangement cannot be inserted in<br>
fully preproduced form from the connection side but rather<br>
merely in the form of the plug-in connector internal<br>
conductor 5 having the associated HF internal conductor 9,<br><br>
16<br>
the dielectric 7 as a holding means and also the<br>
correspondingly preassembled LF internal conductor 27. For<br>
the axially extending portion 27a of the LF internal<br>
conductor 27 is positioned so as to be able to be inserted<br>
through the hole 12a from the connection side. Then, the<br>
balun has to be inserted, along with the internal<br>
dielectric and the plastics material sheathing, into the<br>
hole 21a from the opposing side and soldered to the base<br>
31b of the balun 31 at the end at the soldering point 34<br>
of the LF internal conductors 27.<br>
This construction can be necessary if the decoupling unit<br>
has to have a high impedance level, which is determined by<br>
the ratio of the internal diameter of the balun to the<br>
external diameter of the LF internal conductor, in order<br>
to achieve a high degree of uncoupling between the HF and<br>
LF signals.<br>
It will be apparent from the embodiments that the external<br>
conductor internal diameter and the internal conductor<br>
diameter reduce from the plug-in connector side toward the<br>
connection side, the impedance level preferably remaining<br>
constant. However, the impedance level does not have to<br>
remain constant. There are conceivable embodiments in<br>
which the external conductor internal diameter and the<br>
internal conductor diameter remain constant. Furthermore,<br>
the invention can be carried out in such a way that, for<br>
example, both diameters, or at least one of the two,<br>
increase from the plug-in connector side toward the<br>
connection side.<br>
As stated hereinbefore, the impedance level does not<br>
necessarily have to remain constant over the entire length<br><br>
17<br>
as, for example, in a deliberate departure from a desired<br>
impedance level value, other impedance level values can be<br>
important, i.e. if, for example, compensation is to be<br>
provided for impedance value deviations originating from a<br>
standardised range or produced by soldering points.<br><br>
