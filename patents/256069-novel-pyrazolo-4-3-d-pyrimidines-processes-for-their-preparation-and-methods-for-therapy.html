				<td>NOVEL PYRAZOLO[4,3-D]PYRIMIDINES, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND METHODS FOR THERAPY<br>
This invention relates to new pyrazolo[4,3-d]pynmidine derivatives and to their use in suitable utilities, especially diagnostic- and therapeutic methods<br>
The cell division cycle is usually regarded as a succession of two phases, the S phase (DNA synthesis) and the M phase (segregation of the synthesized DNA in the two daughter cells) interspaced by two gap periods, G1 and G2   The net result of the<br>
cell cycle scenario may not only be growth and differentiation, but also tumor development and apoptosis This view reflects the evidence accumulated over the last 5 years in mammalian field, that the vast majority and quite likely all tumors have suffered one or more defects that derail the cell cycle machinery Such defects can either target components of the cell cycle apparatus, including the checkpoint mechanisms that ensure fidelity and orderly progression through the cell cycle phases, thereby protecting genome, or target elements of the upstream signaling cascades, whose effects eventually converge to trigger cell cycle events (Bartek et al. 1999, J Pathol 187 95-99)<br>
Although the concept of cancer as a disease of the cell cycle implies that every tumour is defective in one or more aspects of all cycle control, it clearly does not mean that oncogenesis targets only the cell cycle clock Development of a tumour appears to require also aberrations in the cell death machinery and cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions that co-operate with cell cycle defects The above concept simply regards cell cycle deregulation as an essential step in the process of multistep tumorigenesis<br>
In terms of the molecular pathogenesis of tumours, cell cycle defects can either represent the initial, predisposing event, or contribute to tumour progression Examples of tumour - predisposing alterations include, for instance, germ-line mutations of the CDK inhibitors p16INK4A or p57lip2, while many of the known cell cycle defects result from somatic mutations or even epigenetic changes that may occur during the early or later stages of tumoungenesis (Hunter 1997, Cell 88 333-346,Fearon 1997, Science 278- 1043-1050)<br>
The importance of cell cycle regulatory proteins, their direct interaction with oncogenes and the tumour suppressor pRb and their frequent deregulation in human tumours has encouraged an active search for low-molecular weight regulators of these proteins Among them the chemical inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases were the first discovered These inhibitors are anti-mitotic and display very interesting antimitotic and anti-tumour activities<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antineurodegenerative, neurodepressive and immunosuppressive compounds having improved selectivity and efficiency index, i e that are less toxic yet more efficacious than analogues known heretofore<br>

UTILITIES<br>
The novel compounds of this invention per se or as intermediates in the preparation of novel compound having a wide variety of diagnostic, therapeutic and industrial utilities<br>
The compounds of this invention are suitable as intermediates for use in the preparation of affinity absorption matrices that harness the chemical properties of the compound's substituent groups For example, the phosphonate groups in matrix bound form are useful in the chromatographic separation of positively charged molecules. Other immobilised examples of the compounds herein are useful in purifying proteins, e g, cell cycle enzymes (cdk's), enzymes involved in recognition of the compound of this invention, e g transport proteins. Suitable methods of incorporation of the compounds of this invention into polymeric resins will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan, for instance the compounds are incorporated by cross-linking hydroxyl groups of the phosphonate or hydroxymethyl substituents<br>
using cross-linking agents heretofore known Linking through a group other than the heterocyclic base will produce a resin useful in hydrophobic affinity chromatography.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts inhibit selectively the enzyme p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase and related cdks (cdk2, cdk5, cdk7, cdk9, erkl, erk2)<br>
In another embodiment, this invention relates to a method for inhibiting cdks and cell proliferation and/or for inducing apoptosis in mammals comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the composition of claim 1 to the mammal The cdk inhibiting molecules are useful for treating disorders, some of them involving cell proliferation, such as cancer, restenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, growth of parasites (animal, protists), graft rejection (host versus graft disease), graft versus host disease, and gout<br>
In still another embodiment, this invention relates to a composition useful for treating fungal infections (fungi) in humans, animals and plants<br>
Tnsubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives of the invention result in the acquisition of extremely high potency against DNA viruses on the part of the defined compounds Such compounds otherwise have been considered to have little or no activity against DNA viruses Moreover, surprisingly the chirally enriched or pure (S)-enantiomer is antivirally active Heretofore, only the (R)-enantiomer was notably antivirally active, and then only against the retroviruses An important aspect of the present invention is a method for inhibiting proliferation of a DNA virus dependent upon events associated with cell proliferation for replication The DNA virus includes any of the hepresvirus family, and most particularly human cyrtomegalovirus The method involves administering a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a cyclin-depedent kinase inhibitor to a patient or animal The therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to inhibit cellular CDK activity to extent impending viral replication Other herpesviruses such as herpes simplex, for example, and other cytomegalovirus are also treatable by the procedures of the present invention<br>
In addition to other cdc 2-related kinases, this kinase controls certain steps of cell division cycles, in particular the transition from G1 phase into the S phase and in particular the transition from the G2 phase into the M-phase. The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can also be used as antimitotic compounds and for treatment of proliferative diseases, such as cancer and restenosis Thus in very low concentration (micromolar and lower), they are capable of inhibiting cell cycle transitions (Gi/S, G2/M, M-phase/metaphase) carried out on the different animal bodies and embryos. Furthermore, the compounds are useful in treating auto -immune diseases, e g. rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc.; in treating Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease such as restenosis, graft rejection (host vs. graft disease), graft vs host disease, gout; and in treating cancer, polycystic kidney disease and other proliferative diseases whose pathogenesis involves abnormal cell proliferation<br>
In addition to proliferative disorders, the treatment of differentiative disorders, which result from, for example, de-differentiation of tissue which may (optionally) be accompanied by abortive reentry into mitosis Such degenerative disorders include chronic neutrodegenerative diseases of the nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the like, as well as spinocerebellar degenerations Other differentiative disorders include, for example, disorders associated with connective tissue, such as may occur due to de-differentiation of chondrocytes or osteocytes, as well as vascular disorders which involve de-differentiation of endothelial tissue and smooth muscle cells, gastric ulcers characterized by degenerative changes in glandular cells, and renal conditions marked by failure to differentiate, e g Wilms tumors.<br>
In addition to therapeutic applications (e.g., for both human and veterinary uses) the compounds of the invention can be used as a cell culture additive for controlling proliferative and/or differentiation states of cells in vitro, for instance, by controlling the level of activation of a CDK To illustrate, in vitro neuronal culture systems have proved to be fundamental and indispensable tools for the study of neural development, as well as the identification of neutrophic factors Once a neuronal cell has become terminally-differentiated, it typically will not change to<br>
another terminally differentiated cell-type However, neuronal cells can neverheless readily lose their differentiated state This is commonly observed when they are grown m culture from adult tissue, and when they form a blastema during regeneration By preventing the activation of a Go/Gl CDK, the subject inhibitors can prevent mitotic progression and hence provide a means for ensuring an adequately restrictive environment in order to maintain neuronal cells at various stages of differentiations, and can be employed, for instance, in cell cultures designed to test the specific activities of trophic factors Other tissue culture systems, which require maintenance of differentiation, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In this respect, each of the CDK4 inhibitors can be used for ex vivo tissue generation, as for example, to enhance the generation of prosthetic tissue devices for implantation<br>
Without being bound to this theory, it is likely that inhibition by the compounds of the invention of the catalytic activity of cyclin-dependent kinases is mediated by interaction of the compounds at the ATP-binding site of the enzyme Such compounds are particularly desirable for reducing excessive cell growth, since they allow inhibition of the kinase activity regardless of the cause underlying the excessive kinase activity leading to excessive cell proliferation Thus, the compounds of the invention are active in situations in which the excessive kinase activity results from the kinase being a mutated hyperactive, form of the kinase and situations in which the kinase is present at excessive levels. Such compounds can also block excessive kinase activity in situations in which the cyclin regulating the kinase is present at excessive levels or its binding to the kinase is enhanced Furthermore, compounds which block kinase activity by interacting with the ATP binding site of the enzyme are also useful for inhibiting kinase activity in situations in which a natural inhibitor of cyclin-kinase complexes is mutated.<br>
It will also be aparent that differential screening assays can be used to select for those compounds of the present invention with specificity for non-human CDK enzymes Thus, compounds, which act specifically on eukaryotic pathogens, e g , are anti-fungal or anti-parasitic agents, can be selected from the subject pyrazolo-pyrimidines inhibitors To illustrate inhibitors of the Candida CDK kinase, CKS 1 can be used in the treatment of candidiasis- and opportunistic infection  that<br>
commonly occurs in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients CKS 1 inhibitors could be used to treat these infections in patients with leukemias and lymphomas, in people who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and in patients with such predisposing factors as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, where fungal infections are a particular problem<br>
By way of illustration, the assays described in the art can be used to screen for agents which may ultimately be useful for inhibiting at least one fungus implicated in such mycosis as candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, blastomycosis, geotrichosis, cryptococcosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, conidiosporosis, histoplasmosis, maduromycosis, rhinospondosis, nocaidiosis, paraactinomycosis, penicilliosis, monoliasis, or sporotrichosis For example, if the mycotic infection to which treatment is desired is candidiasis, an assay as described above or in the appended examples can comprise comparing the relative effectiveness of a test compound on inhibiting a mammalian CDK enzyme with its effectiveness towards a CDK enzyme from yeast, such as selected from the group consisting of Candida albicans, Candida stellatoidea, Candida tropicahs, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida pseudotropicalis, Candida auillermondii, or Candida rugosa. Candida CDK genes have been described, such as in U S Ser No. 08/463 090<br>
Likewise, the differential screening assays can be used to identify anti-fungal agents which may have therapeutic value in the treatment of aspergillosis by making use of the CDK genes cloned from yeast such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans, or Apergillus terreus.<br>
Likewise, where the mycotic infection is mucormycosis, the CDK assay can be derived from yeast such as Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhtzopus oryzae, Absicha corymbifera, Absidia ramosa, or Mucor pusillus. Sources of other CDK enzymes include the pathogen Pneumocystis carina.<br>
In addition to such therapeutic uses, anti-fungal agents developed with such differential screening assays can be used, for example, as preservatives in foodstuff, feed supplement for promoting weight gain in livestock, or in disinfectant formulations for treatment of non-living matter, e g., for decontaminating hospital equipment and rooms<br>
In similar fashion, side by side comparison of inhibition of a mammalian CDK and an insert CDK, such as the Drosophilia CDK5 gene (Hellmich et al (1994) FEBS Lett 356 317-21), will permit selection amongst the subject pyrazolo-pyrimidine derivatives of inhibitors which discriminate between the human/mammalian and insect enzymes. Accordingly, the present invention expressly contemplates the use and formulations of the subject benzopyranone in insecticides, such as for use in management of insect like the fruit fly<br>
In yet another embodiment, certain of the CDK inhibitors of the invention can be selected on the basis of inhibitory specificity for plant CDK s relative to the mammalian enzyme For example, a plant CDK can be dispossed in a differential screen with one or more of the human enzymes to select those pyrazolo-pyrimidine compounds of greatest selectivity for inhibiting the plant enzyme Thus, the present invention specifically contemplates formulations of the subject CDK inhibitors for agricultural applications, such as m the form of a defoliant or the like<br>
This invention also concerns novel compounds that have been discovered to be potent and specific inhibitors of IKB-α kinase which prevents signal induced NF-KB activation and cytokine synthesis in vitro and in vivo Such inhibitors are expected to inhibit synthesis of cytokines and adhesion proteins whose synthesis is transcriptionally regulated by NF-KB Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF and adhesion proteins (e g ICAM, VCAM and selections) belong to this class of molecules and have implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases Thus a potent inhibitor of IicB-a kinase is useful in the clinical management of diseases where the NF-KB activation is required for disease induction<br>
The invention also concerns novel compounds which affect the activation and/or signal transduction of a- and P-adrenergic receptors eg phosphatidyl turnover and cyclic AMP synthesis respectively Activation of P-adrenergic receptors has an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing the cytokine production of macrophages, astrocytes, and by preventing an increase m vascular permeability (see Fig 2) On the other hand a decreased ß-adrenergic receptor activation is useful in diseases like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis The novel compounds may also affect P2-purinergic receptor activation linked to phosphatidyl turnover and inhibition<br>
of activation of cyclic AMP synthesis or Pl-purinergic receptor activation positively or negatively coupled to the activation of adenylate cyclase depending on the receptor subtype Modulation of punnergic receptor signalling may be useful in cerebral ischaemia, stroke, treatments of neurodegenerative diseases (e g Parkinson's disease), renal failure, treatment of lung dysfunction, and in inhibition of cancer growth<br>
It also relates to novel compounds activating p53, the mammal cell's own natural brake gene for stopping uncontrolled cell proliferation (cancer), thus being able to switch off the cancer p53 as well as retinoblastoma (Rb) are two well characterised tumour suppressors whose inactivation may led to uncontrolled cell proliferation and malignancy Phosphorylation of these two proteins, which are involved in the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms, is known to modulate their function Thus, a potent p53 regulators represent a good tool for treatment of cancers due to induction of wild type p53 protein in the selected cancers<br>
Studies carried out on the derivatives of the invention have demonstrated, in addition, the strong effect on apoptosis of many cancer cell lines It has been seen that apoptosis can be induced at stage Gi or G2 and following damage of the DNA, some cells stop at stage Gi and p53-dependent apoptotic pathway is then induced In other situations, it seems that cells stop at G2/M stage in response to damage caused to the DNA, and activation of an independent p53 apoptotic path is observed This path has proved particularly significant in the therapy of tumours in which a less active p53 is observed The interest is therefore assessed that by application of the derivatives of the invention, p5 3-independent apoptosis will be stimulated in cells, which have stopped at stage G2 through damage to the DNA using agents such as mitoxantrone or cis-platinum. The cdk inhibitors of this invention can thus increase the therapeutic potential of the anti-tumour agents currently used<br>
The compounds of this invention will generally be terminally incorporated into the oligonucleotide If they contain a nonphosphonyl free hydroxyl group, they optionally are incorporated internally into the sequence of the oligonucleotide Terminally incorporated diphosphonyl compounds of this invention which contain no free hydroxyl capable of participating in chain elongation also are useful in DNA sequencing in essentially the same manner as deoxyNTPs have been used in the past<br>
(see example 8 of U S Patent 5,276,143) The nucleotide analogues of the invention (when diphosphorylated) are useful as chain terminators for dideoxynucleotide-type DNA sequencing protocols, provided that the nucleotide analogue lacks a free hydroxyl group suitable for polymerase mediated chain elongation. These compounds will not have R=hydroxymethyl and do not posses a cyclic structure incorporating the phosphorus atom (although compounds having such excluded structures can be intermediates) The nucleotide analogue is included in a kit with other reagents (such as Klenow polymerase or T4 polymerase, dNTPs, etc) needed for DNA sequencing (Otvos et a! "Nucl Acids Res " 1987,15  1763-1777 )<br>
If the oligonucleotide-incorporated compound of this invention is binding-competent for its complementary sequence, i e , if it is capable of base pairing, then this nucleotide monomer will participate in hybridisation It is not necessary, however, that the incorporated nucleotide analogue of this invention base pair or otherwise participate in hybridisation If it is located at the terminus of the oligonucleotide, it will be useful as an immunological recognition site, or haptenic recognition site, to facilitate detection of the oligonucleotide by an antibody capable of binding the compound of this invention<br>
The compounds of this invention also are useful as linkers or spacers in preparation of affinity absorption matrices (as opposed to functioning as affinity moieties per se as noted above), immobilised enzymes for process control, or immunoassay reagents The compounds herein contain a multiplicity of functional groups that are suitable as sites for cross-linking desired substances. For example, it is conventional to link affinity reagents such as hormones, peptides, antibodies, drugs, and the like to insoluble substrates These insolubilised bound reagents are employed in known fashion to absorb binding partners for the affinity reagents from manufactured preparations, diagnostic samples and other impure mixtures Similarly, immobilised enzymes are used to perform catalytic conversions with easy recovery of enzyme Bifunctional compounds are commonly used to link analytes to detectable groups in preparing diagnostic reagents<br>
Many functional groups present in the compounds of this invention are suitable for use in cross-linking For example, the phosphonic acid is used to form esters with alcohols or amides with amines The R groups substituted with OH, azido<br>
(which is reduced to amino if desired before cross-linking) or vinyl are exemplary suitable sites Similarly, the amino, halo, acyl and other reactive sites found on group B are suitable Suitable protection of reactive groups will be used where necessary while assembling the cross-linked reagent. In general, the compounds here are used by linking them through phosphonic acid or amino group to the hydroxyl or ammo groups of the linking partner in the same fashion as shown herein, and covalently bound to the other binding partner through an R group For example a first binding partner such as a steroid hormone is estenfied and then this conjugate is cross-linked through hydroxymethyl R to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose, whereby immobilised steroid is obtained. Other chemistries for conjugation are well known See for example Maggio, "Enzyme-Immunoassay" (CRC, 1988, pp 71-135) and references cited therein<br>
The pyrazolo-pyrimidines of this invention are useful for labelling with any conventional detectable label, eg a fluorescent moiety such a fluorescein, radioisotopes such as 14C or 3H, stable free radicals, avidin, biotin and the like all of which previously have been used as labels for immunoassays or diagnostic probes. The label will be present on the oligonucleotide or on the residue of an analogue of this invention Suitable labelling methods are well known and are readily used with reactive groups such as hydroxyl, allyl and the like A simple method is to label the compound of this invention with 3H by proton exchange The compounds also are biotinylated using conventional methods See for instance U.S. Patent 5,276,143 for analogous structures However, the compounds of this invention also are useful directly in diagnostic probe assays without an exogenous detectable label.

Myeloid Colony-forming unit (CFU) assays: Direct myeloid colony formation of CD34+CD38+ cells was assessed in a CFU assay. These assays were initiated with 500 cells per well and plated in duplicate in methylcellulose (0 9%) supplemented with 20 % FCS, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10"s M mercaptoethanol and 10 vol % 5637 conditioned medium of the 5637 bladder carcinoma cell line (containing G-CSF and GM-CSF), 2 U/ml erythropoeitin and 30 U/ml interleukine-3 (IL-3) After 14 days of culture at 37 °C in 7 5 % 02 and 5% CO? in a fully humidified incubator, these cultures were scored with the microscope for colony formation The following colony types were scored myeloid colonies macrophage (CFU-M), granulocyte (CFU-G), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM); erythroid colonies (BFU-E (burst-forming units, erythroid) and CFU-E) , and mixed erytroid-myeloid colonies (CFU-Mix)<br>
Pre-CFU:   Pre-CFU assays were initiated by performing liquid cultures of CD34+CD38" in duplicate in 96-well flat-bottomed plates in IMDM/10%FCS, 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA), and different combinations of the following cytokines 100 U/ml IL-1, 200 U/ml IL-6, 30 U/ml IL-3 and 100 ng/ml stel cell factor (SCF) Pre-CFU cultures were initiated with 500 CD34+CD38* cells/well (200 ul). After 14 days of culture at 37 °C in 7.5 % 02 and 5% C02 in a fully humidified incubator, the number of cells in each well was counted Following this the cells were harvested, washed three times in IMDM/10% FCS, and plated in duplicate at 500 cells/well (1000 ul) in secondary methylcellulose CFU cultures as described for CFU assays.<br>
Effect of new compounds on cell proliferation<br>
Cells were plated at 10000 per well in 200 ul IMDM medium and incubated<br>
with 0-50 µM of the novel compounds (Tab 8), by addition of drug directly to the culture medium and incubated at 37°C for 96 hours (Tab 8) Absolute cell number was determined by addition of a known concentration Fluoresbrite microspheres (FITC) (Polysciences, Inc.). The absolute number of cells/well was calculated as {(total number of beads added/well)/(number of beads measured)X(number of measured cells in the gate of interest)) All analyses were performed with a FACScan (BD), using CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson)<br>
Response of the myeloid leukemia KG1 and T-lymphocyte leukemia Molt3 cell lines to the cytostatic effect of the novel compounds was determined using the above-mentioned standardized bead suspension, that was used to determine the absolute cell number by flow cytometric (FCM) measurement Cells were grown in the presence of increasing concentration of the novel compounds After 96 hours of culture the concentration at which cell growth was inhibited by 50% - the 50% inhibitory concentration or lC5o - was calculated from dose-response curves (Fig 4) and are presented in Table 8<br>
Table 8 Tested novel compounds. Structural names and IC50 values on the different cell culture systems (lymphocytes, KG1, Molt3, CFU and pre-CFU) and on CDC2 activity in cell free system<br><br>
Different response patterns were seen for the novel compounds tested, with IC50 ranging from 3 µM to &gt; 50 µM for KG1 and from 5 µM to &gt; 50 µM for Molt3<br>
Clonogenic output of KGl was tested in methylcellulose with 25 µM of some of the novel compounds Colony output vs. control cultures without novel compound, was 16% for 26, 19% for 98, 8% for 172 and 0% for 201<br>
PHA-stimulated lymphocytes (PBMC) were tested for their cytotoxicity as one of the normal counterparts of the cell lines Cells were grown for 96 hours in the presence of IL-2 and different concentrations of the novel compounds and cell number was counted on the flow cytometer The IC50 values are shown in Table 8 Comparison between normal PHA-stimulated lymphocytes and hematopoietic cell lines shows that lymphocytes are often more sensitive to the novel compounds than cell lines, with the exception of 96, that was significantly more effective on KGl than<br>
on normal PBMC (Fig 5)   (Table Removed) <br>
To determine reversibility of the effects of the novel compounds, cells were plated at 10000 per well and exposed to 0-50 µM of the compounds for the time indicated, followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies) and reseeded into drug-free medium for 7 additional days. An identical set of cells was plated and exposed to the drugs for 7 additional days. After 7 days (168 hours), the relative cell number was assayed by flow cytometry When KGl cells were exposed continuously to compounds 17, 172 and 201 the IC50 were respectively 16 ± 1 7 µM, 7 ± 2 µM and 16 ± 1 3 µM (Tab 8) However, if cells were washed free of novel compounds after 6 hours of exposure to 17, 172 and 201, there was substantial recovery of cell number as compared to control without novel.<br>
CD34+CD38+ hematopoietic progenitors (HPC) from adult bone marrow were isolated and investigated for response to novel compounds. CD34+CD38+ cells were grown in a methylcellulose system in the presence of increasing concentrations of compounds After 14 days, colonies were microscopically scored and IC50 concentrations were calculated from the dose-response patterns of total colony output (Tab 8) 26, 98, 172 were further investigated for their effect on growth of (primitive) hematopoietic progenitors 96 and 201 were chosen as potent control 26, 98 and 158 have low or no inhibitory activity on progenitors with IC50 &gt; 50 µM 201 has potent inhibitory activity with a IC50 of 8 5 µM, 201 has intermediate effect with an IC50 of 37 µM<br>
Clonogenic output of CD34+CD38+ HPC was also scored differentially 26 caused no significant difference in the output of the different types of myeloid colonies. Culture with 17, 98, 172 and 201 resulted in significantly lower colony output for CFU-E, CFU-G and CFU-M, with an exception for P27 where CFU-M were not significantly decreased No significant difference was seen for CFU-GM and CFU-MTX for tested compounds Control semi-solid cultures with DMSO were not significantly different from the control cultures<br>
Pre-CFU were cultured starting from adult bone marrow CD34+CD38' cells, that had been isolated using the FCM cell sorter Novel compounds were added at different concentrations to the primary 14-day liquid culture    IC50 was calculated<br>
from   dose-response   curves   from   total   clonogeruc   output   after   secondary methylcellulose culture (Tab  8) Effects were in a range similar to those on CFU with an exception for 26 that was more active on pre-CFU than on CFU EXAMPLE 24: Antimitotic activities of CDK inhibitors<br>
Metaphase-arrested Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described previously by Blow "J. Cell Biol" 1993,122.993 and stored in liquid nitrogen Demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei were prepared as described by Blow &amp; Laskey "Cell" 1986,47 577 After thawing, extracts were supplemented with 25 mM phosphocreatine, 5 µg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 250 µg/ml cycloheximide, [α-32P]dATP (for DNA synthesis assays) Demembranated sperm nuclei were added to a final sperm concentration of 3 ng/µ1 DNA extract and CDK inhibitor tested was then added at different concentrations M-phase promoting factor inhibition by different CDK inhibitors was monitored 1 5 h after addition by assessing the amount of sperm nuclei that had been assembled into interphase nuclei, possessing a complete phase-dense nuclear envelope DNA synthesis was assessed by releasing extract into interphase by the addition of 0 3 mM CaCl2 and measuring the total amount of [ct-32P]dATP incorporation after 3 h by TCA co-precipitation<br>
At concentrations of CDK inhibitors (see Table 9) ranging from 0 1-2 u.M, chromosomes remained highly condensed and no nuclear envelope was visible At 4-6 u.M and higher concentrations, interphase nuclei appeared with partially decondensed chromatin and an intact nuclear envelope Replication was significantly inhibited at 1 - 5 µM CDK inhibitors tested. For the inhibition effect to become detectable, the first 15-min incubation of the interphase extract is probably sufficient<br>

EXAMPLE 25: In vitro Cytotoxic Activity of Novel Compounds<br>
We have been using the following cell lines HELA (human cervical carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblasts), HOS (human osteogenic sarcoma), HL 60 (human promyelocyte leukemia), G 361 (human malignant melanoma), K562 (human erythroleukaemia), CEM (human lymphoblastoid leukaemia)   Tested drugs<br>
were added to the cell cultures in six different concentration and kept at 37°C and 5% CO2 for three days All cell lines were grown in DMEM medium (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and L-glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% C02 104 cells were seeded into each well of 96 well plate, allowed to stabilize for at least 2 h and then tested compounds were added at various concentrations ranging from 200 to 0,2 µM in triplicates. Three days after drug addition Calcein AM solution (Molecular Probes) was added and let to enter the cells for 1 hour Fluorescence of viable cells was quantified employing Fluoroskan Ascent (Microsystems) The GI50 value, the drug concentration lethal to 50% of the tumour cells, was calculated from the obtained dose response curves (Fig 6)<br>
Cytoxicity of novel compounds was tested on panel of cell lines of different histogenetic and species origin (Tab 10) Higher activities were found in all tumour cell lines tested Notably, the higher effectiveness of novel derivatives was also found in cell lines bearing various mutations or deletions in cell cycle associated proteins, e g HL-60, BT549, Hela, U20S, MDA-MB231, and Saos2 It indicates that these substances should be equally effective in tumours with various alterations of tumour suppressor genes, namely p53, Rb, etc Importantly, this observation distinguishes the novel compounds from flavopiridol and related compounds, as their biological activity is dependent on p53 status<br>

EXAMPLE 26: Novel Compounds Have Cytotoxic Effects for Plant Cells and Induce their Apoptosis<br>
The novel compounds have also been tested in tobacco callus bioassay for cytotoxicity (herbicidal activity) and induction of cell death The compunds to be tested were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and the solution brought up to 10"3 M with distilled water This tock solution was further diluted in the respective media used for the tobacco bioassay to concentration ranging from 10* M to 10-4 M The final concentration of DMSO in the media did not exceed 0 2%, and therefore did not affect biological activity in the assay system used Cytokinin-dependent tobacco callus Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Wisconsins 38 Murashige-Skoog medium, containing per 1 liter 4(imol nicotinic acid, 2 4 µmnol pyridoxine hydrochloride, 1.2 µmol thiamine, 26 6 umol glycine, 1 37 H-mol glutamine, 1 8 µmol myo inositol, 30 g of sucrose, 8 g of agar, 5.37 u.mol α-naphtylacetic acid and 0.5 µmol 6-benzylaminopurine Subcultuvation was carried out every three weeks Fourteen days before the bioassay, the callus tissue was transferred to the media without 6-benzylaminopurine Compounds were tested with two different concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (10" M and 10"6 M) Inhibitory growth activity was determined from the increase in fresh callus weight after four weeks of cultivation Five replicates were prepared for each concentration tested and the entire test was repeated at least twice Inhibitory activity was compared with growth response curve of 6-benzylaminopurine in the range from 10'8"M to 10-4'M and IC50 was calculated for each compound for 10s M and 10"6 M of 6-benzylaminopurine (Fig 7) Figure 7 shows an inhibitory effect of a compound 17.<br><br>

Table 11 shows the results of inhibitory activity of novel compounds on growth of tobacco cells cultivated in vitro Most of the 3,5,7-trisubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives showed marked inhibitory activity on in vitro growth Furthermore, these compounds are able to induce apoptosis in plants cells (are able to kill plant cells) and induce strong antimitotic activities (see Fig 8) The results presented here clearly show that the novel compounds exhibit herbicidal activity<br>
EXAMPLE 27: Induction of Apoptosis by Novel Compounds in Plant Cells Seeds of field bean (Viciafaba L) were germinated at 25°C in Hoagland solution Seedlings with about 2-cm long main roots were treated with new cdk inhibitors at concentration from 20-300 µM for various time periods of 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48h Antibodies<br>
CDC-2 was detected with rabbit polyclonal Ab prepared against to a peptide (RITARGALEHEYFKDIK) corresponding to the last 16 amino acids of cdc2Ms (Hirt et al, 1991) as described in Bogre et al, (1997) Monoclonal antibody MPM-2 against phosphorylated epitope in mitotic cells was kindly provided by Dr P Rao (University ofTexas, Texas Medical Center, Houston). Microbutular structures were detected with mouse monoclonal antibody DmlA (Sigma) against a-tubulin, or with rabbit affinity purified antibody against α,ß-tubulin heterodimer The -tubuiin was<br>
detected with mouse monoclonal antibody TU-31, or with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novakova et al Cell Motil Cytoskel 33,1996 38-51) Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and indocarbocyanate (Cy3)-conjugated antimouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PNN, USA) Anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was from Promega Biotec (Madison, VI, USA) Immunofluorescence staining<br>
Root tips were fixed in 3 7% paraformaldehyde in microtubule stabilising buffer (MTSB, l00mM PIPES, 1 mM MgS04, 2 0 mM EGTA, pH 6.9) for 1 hr After washing in MTSB root tips were digested for 30 min in 1% Cellulysin (Calbiochem) in MTSB with protease inhibitors (0 3 mM leupeptin, 1 0 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride) After washing, root tips were squashed on poly-L-lysine coatrd slides. Cells were thereafter fixed for 10 min in 100% methanol at -20°C followed by 30 min extraction with 1% Triton X-100 in MTSB at root temperature. After washing in PBS slides were incubated with primary antibodies for lh at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. All antibody dilutions were made with 2% BSA in PBS Antibody TU-31, was used as undiluted supernatant, antibodies DMAl and MPM-2 were used at dilution 1.500. Polyclonal antibodies against a,P-tubulin heterodimer and g tubulin were at dilution 15 After washing m PBS slides were incubated for 45 min at root temperature with secondary fluorochrome conjugated antibodies diluted 1 200 After washing out of secondary antibody samples were stained for 10 min with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) in PBS (lum/mg) Slides were mounted in MOWIOL 4-88 (Calbiochem, Lucerne, Switzerland) and examined with Olympus BX 60 microscope equipped with a 100x1 4 standard objective, epi-illumination and a 35 mm camera.<br>
Labelling ofDNA strand breaks with BrdUTP<br>
Fixation, digestion with enzymes, squashing to poly-L lysine slides and posrfixation with methanol were the same as described for immunofluorescence Then reaction containing bromdeoxyundine triphosphate (Sigma) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Boehringer) was applied to slides and enzyme reaction proceeded 40 min at 37°C After washing in PBS buffer slides were incubated with anti-BrdU MoAb solution (Amersham, Buskinhamshire, UK) and with secondary anti-mouse FITS<br>

Root tips were homogenized in liquid nitrogene and incubated in CTAB lysis buffer (2% CTAB w/v, 0,1 M Tris, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8,0, 0,2% fl-mercaptoethanol) at 65°C for 5 minutes The samples were then extracted chloroform isoamyl alcohole, and aqueous phase precipitated with ethanol The DNA samples were resuspended in TE buffer, electroforesis was run 40 min at voltage 2 VI cm Observetions<br>
Novel derivatives were used, to study the role on CDKs in cell cycle progression and microtubule organisation in Viciafaba root tip cells The tested drugs inhibited the activity of immunopurified Viciafaba and alfalfa cdc2-kinase The transcript levels of an A- and B-type cyclin, as well as of the cdc2 genes, declined in treated root tips, while the mRNA level of a D-type cyclin gene was not affected An observed transient arrest at the Gl/S and G2/M regulatory points indicated that inhibition of the cdc2-kinase had an effect on both transitions In contrast to the regular bipolar spindle in untreated cells, in drug treated metaphase cells abnormally short and dense kinetochore microtubule fibres were observed These microtubules were randomly arranged in the vicinity of the kinetochores and connected the chromosomes Thus, the chromosomes were not aligned on the metaphase plate but were arranged in a circle, with kinetochores pointing inwards and chromosome arms pointing outwards y-Tubulin, which plays a role in microtubule nucleation, also localised to the centre on the monopolar spindle. The observed abnormalities in mitosis, after inhibition of CDC2-kinase by specific CDK drugs, suggest a role for this enzyme in regulating some of the steps leading to a bipolar spindle structure These compounds also induce apoptosis of different plant cells in vivo (Fig 8)<br><br>
EXAMPLE 28: Inhibition of Senescence by Novel Compounds<br>
In this example, human diploid fibroblasts (HCA cells of varoius passage levels<br>
passage 25 - designated HCA25, passage 45 - designated HCA45, passage 80<br>
- designated HCA80) were stained for ß-galactosidase activity The medium<br>
present on cultured cells was removed, the cells were washed twice in PNS,<br>
and fixed in 2-3 ml of fixing solution comprised of a 2% formaldehyde and<br>
0 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS The cells were incubated at room temperature for<br>
5 minutes, then washed twice with PBS The cells were then incubated at 37°C<br>
(without CO2) for 1 to 16 hours in 2-3 ml of a solution comprising potassium<br>
ferricyanide (5 mM), potassium ferrocyanide (5 mM), MgCl2 (2 mM), X-gal (5-<br>
bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside)	(1	mg/ml),	in<br>
citric/phosphate buffer, pH 6 0) Following this incubation period, the cell samples were observed in order to detect the presence of blue cells, indicating that X-gal had been cleaved (positively senescent cells) In this experiment, senescent cells, but not other cells were stained blue due to the action of P-galactosidase on the substrate (Fig. 9)<br>

As shown in Table 12 with incerasmg numbers of pasages, the staining bacame darker For the oldest cells, there were only blue cells ranging from a bright blue to an almost opaque color Trisubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pynmidines were not active in delaying senescence and from this reason the results are not presented in detail On the other hand mono- and disubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives were very affective retaining much lower level of senescent cells after 80 passages Substitution at R7 was the most effective from all possible substitutions of the pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine ring<br>
EXAMPLE 29: Novel Compounds Induce Apoptosis in Tumour Cells<br>
For detection of apoptotic versus necrotic mode of cell death, two independent methods were employed assessment of morphology by fluorescence microscopy and analysis of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry using the TUNEL technique<br>
Determination of apoptosis and cell cycle distribution<br>
Microscopy: Nuclear morphology of the cells was analysed with the fluorochromes Hoechst 33342 (ES max 346 nm, m max 460 nm) (Sigma) prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS at 0 1 mg/ml, added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml and ethidium homodimer (EB) (EX max 540 nm, .Em max 625 nm) (Sigma) prepared in PBS at 100 µg/ml and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 2µg/ml (Lizard, 1995) Hundred cells were counted for each sample and percentage of apoptosis was determined<br>
TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)- Control and novel compound-treated cell cultures were washed with PBS and fixed in 1% buffered formaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 15 minutes on ice After washing in PBS, cells were permeabilized in 70 % cold (-20°C) ethanol and transferred to 4 °C for at least 1 hour After rehydratation in PBS, cells were labeled with 50 µl/well TUNEL reaction mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) Cells were incubated in this solution at 37°C for 40 minutes, washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 µl PBS containing 5 µg/ml EB and 0 1 % RNAse After 30 minutes of incubation at 4°C, green (FITC-dUTP) and red (EB-DNA) fluorescence of individual cells was measured on a FACscan flow cytometer (Gorczyca, 1993). Negative control (fixed and permeabilized cells incubated with 50 ul label solution per well without terminal transferase, instead of TUNEL reaction mixture) and positive control (fixed and permeabilized cells incubated with DNase I (100 µg/ml) that induces DNA strand breaks) were included in each experimental set-up<br>
Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis by FACS: Cells (1 106/ml) were cultured in 6-well plates with or without 70 µM concentration of OC derivatives at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3-24 hours Following the incubation cells were pelleted, washed in Hank's buffered salt solution and fixed in 96% ethanol overnight at -20° C Low molecular weight apoptotic DNA was extracted in citrate buffer and RNA was cleaved by RNA-se (50µg/ml) The DNA was stained by ethidium bromide and the cells were analyzed by flow-cytometry using a 488 nm single beam laser (Becton Dickinson)<br>
Pro-apoptotic effect of new compounds<br>
Fluorescence microsopy analysis of apoptosis and necrosis. Cell cultures treated with different doses of novel compounds were examined microscopically for apoptosis Apoptotic cells exhibit a very bright Hoechst 33342 fluorescence, while viable cells display a very faint fluorescence Late apoptotic cells or secondarily necrotic cells display a fragmented nucleus with bright red ethidium bromide fluorescence Primary necrotic cells show a red fluorescence and do not have fragmented nuclei An illustration of these different features can be found in Figure 9 (MCF-7-cell line incubated with compound 98)<br>
Figure 10 shows the result of microscopic examination of KG I cells incubated with 98, 172 and 201 Viable, apoptotic, necrotic (= primary necrosis, not following apoptosis) and secondarily necrotic cells (= late apoptotis, evolving to necrosis) were scored differentially after 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of exposure to novel compounds For the three products a different apoptosis-inducing pattern could be observed Apoptosis induction occurs fast after incubation with 172 and 201 but slower after incubation with 98<br>
Flow cytometric detection of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis- The induction of apoptotic death of MCF-7 cells by the novel compounds was confirmed using the TUNEL reaction technique (Fig 9). Initial phase contrast microscopy examinations indicated that the CDKIs treated MCF-7 line exhibit typical morphological  features of apoptotic cells and this was later confirmed by electron microscopy on CEM cells(Fig  10) Corresponding results were obtained from flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content in CEM cells treated with various cytokirun derivatives (Fig  11) Extensive apoptosis of tumor cells, measured as a percentage of sub-Go/Gl, was initiated in the treated cells as early as 6 hours after the treatment The distribution of cells within the cell cycle showed an early disappearance of G2/M and S-phase cells in the treated cells (Fig  11).   Further experiments were designed to manipulate the apoptotic process in order to elucidate the mechanisms of cell death These results indicates that inhibition of DNA transcription/protein translation, by the specific inhibitors actinomycin D and cycloheximide respectively, does not influence synthetic CDKIs  induced  apoptosis   However,  both  the  inactivation  of serine/threonine phosphatases by ocadaic acid or the inhibition of caspases by specific peptide YVAD, inhibited CDK inhibitor triggered apoptosis. Nonetheless the down regulation of poly<br>
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity by specific inhibitor, 3-aminobenzarmde, did not influence the apoptotic process Apoptosis triggered by synthetic CDKIs was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of the Rb protein (110 kDa) and the appearance of the hypocoincvdent form of Rb (105 kDa), which was later cleaved to a 40 kDa lmmunoreactive Rb fragment and rapidly degraded (not shown). Since the cleavage of lamin B and PARP was also detected we assume that activated caspases digested those proteins.<br>
Exposure to 201 demonstrates apoptosis detected already after 6 hours of incubation After 6 and 12 hours of incubation the apoptotic population seems mainly to evolve from S phase Apoptotic cells in Go-Gi phase increase with time after 24 hours No significant difference was detected between control and the non-apoptotic population in the incubated culture<br>
EXAMPLE 30: Immunosuppressive activity<br>
One of the most important parameters of specific cellular immunity is proliferative response of lymphocytes to antigens or polyclonal mitogens. The majority of normal mammalian peripheral lymphocytes comprise resting cells Antigens or nonspecific polyclonal mitogens have the capacity to activate lymphoid cells and this is accompanied by dramatic changes of intracellular metabolism (mitochondrial activity, protein synthesis, nucleic acids synthesis, formation of blastic cells and cellular proliferation) Compounds with ability to selectively inhibit lymphocyte proliferation are potent immunosuppressants Variety of m vitro assays was developed to measure proliferative response of lymphocytes The most commonly used is 3H-thymidine incorporation method<br>
During cell proliferation, DNA has to be replicated before the cell is divided into two daughter cells This close association between cell doublings and DNA synthesis is very attractive for assessing cell proliferation. If labeled DNA precursors are added to the cell culture, cells that are about to divide incorporate the labeled nucleotide into their DNA Traditionally, those assays usually involve the use of radiolabeled nucleosides, particularly tritiated thymidine ([3H]-TdR) The amount of [3H]-TdR incorporated into the cellular<br>
DNA is quantified by liquid scintillation counting<br>
Human hepannized peripheral blood was obtained from healthy volunteers by cubital vein punction The blood was diluted in PBS (1.3) and mononuclear cells were separated by centnfugation in Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Pharmacia, 1.077 g/ml) at 2200 rpm for 30 minutes Following centrifugation, lymphocytes were washed in PBS and resuspended in cell culture medium (RMPI 1640, 2mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum and sodium bicarbonate)<br>
The cells were diluted at target density of 1 100 000 cells/ml were added by pipette (180 µl) into 96/well microtiter plates Four-fold dilutions of the intended test concentration were added at time zero in 20 µl aliquots to the microtiter plate wells Usually, test compound was evaluated at six 4-fold dilutions In routine testing, the highest well concentration was 266 7 nM. All drug concentrations were examined in duplicates All wells with exception of unstimulated controls were activated with 50 uJ of concanavalm A (25 µg/ml) Incubations of cells with test compounds lasted for 72 hours at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 100% humidity At the end of incubation period, the cells were assayed by using the [3H]-TdR<br>
Cell cultures were incubated with 0 5 uCi (20 u.1 of stock solution 500 |aCi/ml) per well for 6 hours at 37 °C and 5% C02 The automated cell harvester was used to lyse cells in water and adsorb the DNA onto glass-fiber filters in the format of microtiter plate The DNA incorporated [3H]-TdR was retained on the filter while unincorporated material passes through. The filters were dried at room temperature overnight, sealed into a sample bag with 10-12 ml of scintillant The amount of [3H]-TdR present in each filter (in cpm) was determined by scintillation counting in a Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. The effective dose of immunosuppressant (ED) was calculated using the following equation ED = (CCPMdmg exposed well / mean CCPMcontrol wells) x 100% The ED50 value, the drug concentration inhibiting proliferation of 50% of lymphocytes, was calculated from the obtained dose response curves<br>
To evaluate immunosuppressive activity of substituted adenines, their<br>
ability to inhibit polyclonal mitogen induced proliferation of normal human lymphocytes was analyzed (Tab 13) Our data demonstrate that these compounds have only marginal activity on 3H-thymidine incorporation, nonetheless, they efficiently inhibit proliferation of activated lymphocytes Effective immunosuppressive dose of new derivatives under in vitro conditions was close to 1 -20 µM<br>

EXAMPLE 31: Antiviral Activity<br>
The activity of the compounds against HIV-1- and HIV-2-induced cytopathicity was examined in human lymphocyte MT-4 cells The cells (300 000 cells/ml) were infected with 100 CCID50 (1 CCID50 is a virus quantity which causes cytopathicity effect in 50% of the cells under the experimental conditions) of HIV-1 or HIV-2 and added to 200 ul wells of a microtiter plate containing different dilutions of the tested compounds The infected cell cultures were incubated at 37°C for 5 days in a humidified C02 incubator The cytopathicity of the virus was examined by determination of MT-4 cell viability by trypan blue dye staining The results are summarised in Tab 10 with comparison on the prototype compounds<br>
Table 14 also shows the results of activity testing of novel compounds against MSV-induced transformation in murine embryo fibroblast C3H/3T3 cells The cells were seeded in 1 -ml-wells of 48-well plates and exposed to 80 PFU (plaque forming umts) for 60 - 90 min The virus was subsequently removed and culture medium containing appropriate concentrations of the tested compounds was added (1 ml per well) At day 6-post infection, MSV-induced transformation of the cell culture was examined microscopically The results are summarised in Table 14 in comparison with the data on the prototype compounds<br>

Transfections were performed using the Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN, Germany) as recommended by the supplier Stable transfectants were selected at 2 mg/ml G418 sulphate (Life Technologies). The expression of Ddp53 miniprotein in MCF-7Ddp53 cell line has been examined by immunoblotting with Bp53-10 monoclonal antibody Independently isolated MCF-7Dp53 clones 9,12 and 14 expressing high levels of Ddp53 miniprotein and MCF-7-neo clones 3,4 and 7 were used<br>
25 induces wild-type, but not mutant, p53 protein<br>
First, we determined appropriate concentration of 25 for our experiments The MCF-7 (wt p53) cells were treated for 12 hrs with increasing concentrations of ranging from 1 to 100 µM and analysed for p53 protein expression using monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Fig LA). The concentration of 25 20-100 µM has been shown to affect the level of p53 protein in these cells As shown at Fig 1A the level of protein expression induced by 20 p.M 25 was not substantially different from expression induced by 100 µM concentration was selected for further experiments Second, the periods of time 6, 12 and 24 hrs were chosen, since the level of protein expression reached a steady state Fig. shows a time-dependent increase of p53 after 20µM treatment with 25.<br>

Effect of 25 and related compounds on activation of p53 protein was also analysed in human melanoma cell line Arn8 and murine fibroblast cell line T22LacZ expressing 6-galactosidase under control of p53 responsive promoter Induction of wt p53 in these cells treated with 20µM 25 (6, 12 and 24 hrs) leads to activation of responsive promoter and consequently to expression of ß-galactosidase Arn8 and T221acZ cells treated with 25 were fixed and examined microscopically for ß-galactosidase activity using X-gal substrate leading to about 25% blue-coloured cells compared to less than 1% of blue-coloured cells in DMSO-treated control cells (data not shown) The total G-galactosidase activity in Arn8 cells was also assessed using colorimetric assay The results show strong activity of ß-galactosidase at periods of<br>
time 12 and 24 hours after treatment giving evidence of transcriptionally active p53 protein in comparison with control cells treated with DMSO<br>
This transcription activity was also proved by analysing p21WAF1 expression in MCF-7 cells The induction of pS3 protein was apparent in 4 hrs but enhanced level of p21WAFIprotein was observed in only 12 hrs after treatment with 25 (Fig. 16) Only cells expressing wt p53 responded to 25 with p21 induction. To confirm, that p21WAF1 induction is p53-responsive, a series of stable transfected MCF-7 clones expressing high levels of a dominant-negative Ddp53 miniprotein was established This protein, consisting of amino acids 1-14 and 302-390 of mouse p53 sequence, has been shown to bind to the C-terminus of wt p53 and abrogate the p53-dependent transcription. The control MCF-7neo clones were also established by stable transfection of MCF-7 cells with the backbone vector pCMVneo without insert Clones expressing high level of Ddp53 as well as the control clones were treated with 25 and assayed for p21WAF1 expression using immunoblotting with p21w specific monoclonal antibody 118 As a result of Ddp53 expression, disrupting p53 transcriptional activity, no p21WAF1 induction could be detected in MCF-7Ddp53 clones (Fig 17)<br>
Following compounds had comparable effects but the concentrations of the tested compound inducing maximum of p-galactosidase activity differed from each to another These results are presented in Table 15 as concentration inducing maximum of P-galactosidase activity It seems that tnsubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines with hydrophobic substituents at R3,R5, and R7 are powerful inducers of wt p53 expression<br>

EXAMPLE 33: Bovine Oocyte and Embryo Development Following Meiotic Inhibition with Selected Trisubstituted Pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine<br>
During final oocyte maturation, immature oocytes progress from prophase I, the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, to metaphase II at which stage they are arrested again until insemination or parthenogenetic activation Despite much research in the area of in vitro embryo production over the past decade, only 30-40% of bovine oocytes develop to the blastocyst stage following in vitro maturation, fertilisation, and culture While suboptimal culture conditions undoubtedly contribute to this poor development, the intrinsic quality of the oocyte itself is the key limiting factor<br>
New approaches towards improving oocyte development are examining the „prematuration" of the oocyte i e., holding the oocyte at GV stage in vitro before submission to normal in vitro maturation It is hypothesised that if oocytes are cultured in vitro under conditions that maintain arrest at the GV stage, then they may have the opportunity to acquire greater developmental competence<br>
Oocyte Collection and In Vitro Maturation (JVM)<br>
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St.Louis, MO) unless otherwise indicated A stock solution of 10 µg/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) was prepared, aliquoted and stored at -20°C until use.<br>
Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained by aspiration of 2-8 mm Follicles of ovaries from slaughtered cows Following four washes in modified phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, supplemented with 36 µg/ml pyruvate, 50µg/ml gentamycm, and 0,5mg/ml bovine serum albumin, Sigma fraction V, cat # A-9647), groups of approximately 50 COCs were placed in 500 ul of maturation medium in 4-well dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) for 24 hr culture at 39°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air with maximum humidity The maturation medium was Medium 199 supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS)<br>
Sperm Preparation and In vitro Fertilization (IVF)<br>
For IVF, COCs were washed four times in PBS and then in fertilisation medium before being transferred in groups of 50 into four-well plates containing 250 ul of fertilisation medium (Tyrode's medium with 25 mM bicarbonate, 22mM Na-lactate, 1 M Na-pyruvate, 6 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 10 µg/ml heparin-sodium salt-184 U/mg, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) per well Motile spermatozoa were obtained by centrifugation of frozen-thawed spermatozoa (Dairygold AI Station, Mallow, Ireland) on a Percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) discontinuous density gradient (2,5 ml 45% Percoll over 2,5 ml 90% Percoll) for 20 min at 700 g at room temperature Viable spermatozoa, collected at the bottom of the 90% fraction, were washed in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's and pelleted by centrifugation at l00g for 10 min Spermatozoa were counted in a haemocytometer and diluted in the appropriate volume of TALP to give a concentration of 2 x 106 spermatozoa/ ml, a 250 µl aliquot of this suspension was added to each fertilisation well to obtain a final concentration of 1 x 106 spermatozoa/ml Plates were incubated for 24 hr in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 39°C<br>
In vitro Culture (IVC)<br>
Embryo culture was carried out in modified synthetic oviduct fluid medium (SOF) under mineral oil in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% 02, 90% N2 at 39°C (Carolan et al, 1995). Twenty-four hours after insemination, presumptive zygotes were denuded of cumulus cells by vortexing for 2 min in 2 ml of PBS The zygotes were then washed four times in PBS and then in SOF before being<br>
transferred to 25µl culture droplets. Fetal calf serum was added to the droplets (10%, v/v) 24 hr after placement in culture (i.e, 48 hr post-insemination, hpi). Blastocyst rates were recorded at days 6-8 post-insemination. For estimation of blastocyst cell numbers, blastocysts were placed on a slide, air-dried, and fixed in 100% ethanol overnight They were subsequently stained using Hoechst 33342 (lOmg/ml in 2,3% (w/v) sodium citrate) and visualised with an epifluorescence microscope<br>
Oocyte Vitrification<br>
Matured oocytes were vitrified using the methods described by Dinnyes at al (2000) Matured COCs were partially denuded by a short exposure to 0 1% hyaluorudase and subsequent pipetting Oocytes were washed three times in TCM 199 supplemented with 20% FCS and then suspended in an equilibration medium consisting of 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol in TCM 199 + 20% FCS at 39°C for 12-15 mm Following equilibration, groups of 5-10 oocytes were rinsed three times in small drops o vitrification solution consisting of 25% ethylene glycol, 5% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0,4 M trehalose m TCM 199+20% FCS, for 25-30 sec, and dropped onto the surface of a steel cube which was covered with aluminum foil and cooled down to between -150 and -180°C by partial immersion in LN2<br>
Vitrified droplets were thawed by dropping them into a 0 3 M trehalose solution for 3 min Oocyte survival was then evaluated based on the integrity of the oocyte membrane and the zona pellucida The surviving vitrified-thawed oocytes were parthenogenetically activated and cultured as described above<br>
Oocyte Activation<br>
For parthenogenetic activation, following IVM, oocytes were fully denuded of cumulus and activated by a 5min exposure to Ca-ionophore A23187 at room temperature followed by culture in 2,5 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine for 3,5 hr (Liu et al, 1998) The oocytes were then placed in culture as described above<br>
Results<br>
In this study we have shown that 16, a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, inhibits meiotic resumption in bovine oocytes by blocking germinal vesicle<br>
breakdown in dose-dependent manner (Fig 18) A concentration 30 µM blocked over 60% of oocytes, while 100 µM inhibited almost all oocytes compared to the control in which over 85% resumed meiosis Following a second 24 hr culture under conditions permissive to normal maturation, almost all (90%) of blocked oocytes resumed meiosis and progressed to metaphase II In terms of developmental competence, oocytes maintained in meiotic arrest for 24 hr with 80 µM exhibited a similar capacity to develop to the blastocyst stage as non-blocked control oocytes following maturation, fertilisation, and culture in vitro Cryopreservation was employed as a tool to detect differences in the oocyte viability between blocked and control oocytes Cleavage of oocytes was significantly reduced following vitrification and activation both m BL-1 treated (40,2% vs. 71,9%, P
