The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to Tri-acetyl-3-hydroxylphenyl adenosine,the preparation method thereof ,the pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in the manufacture of pharmaceutical for hyperlipidemia,belongs to the field of medical technology.<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
Basic researches and clinical trial results have proved that hyperlipidemia, including hypercholesteremia, hypertriglyceridemia, and complex hyperlipidemia, is key risk factor of stroke, cornary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and sudden death due to heart failure. Moreover, hyperlipidemia is a key risk factor to promote hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes. It also leads to adiposis hepatica, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, subhyaloid hemorrhage, acroisa, peripheral angiopathy, and hyperuricacidemia.<br>
At present, the clinically widely used lipid regulating agents contain cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme inhibitor statins and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor (PPARs) transcription factor activator fibrates. Statins decrease endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) via inhibition on activity of HMG-CoA reductase. Meanwhile, statins reduce blood content of LDL by increasing or activating the express level of LDL receptor on hepatocellular surface. Fibrates are a class of lipid regulator that mainly acting on triglyceride. The two classes of drugs are main trend of lipid regulators. The clinic pharmacodynamic action is exact, the potent dosage is low, and the bioavailability is high. However, side effect of the two classes, such as liver injury and rhabdomyolysis, causes security problems being worried and worth concerned. <br>
Compared to the drug development pattern in western drug manufacturers, finding new type lipid regulator in Chinese traditional herbal medicine is a new drug developing way that suitable for our country. Lots of Chinese herbal medicine with good lipid regulating action and low adverse effect has wide application perspective. For instance, triterpenes in Chinese hawthorn inhibit cholesterol synthesis in vivo and accelerate cholesterol clearance. Anthraquinone is the active components contained by rhubarb, semen, and fleeceflower root, it promotes enterokinesia, and increase cholesterol excretion. The lipid lowering effect of Alisma L. orientale Juzep is associated to interference of triterpene compounds with endogenous metabolism of cholesterol. Danshensu in salvia miltiorrhiza indicates inhibitory action on cholesterol synthesis in vitro. Salvia miltiorrhiza increases excretion of bile acid. Gypenosides in Gold Theragran can reduce the level of blood LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, and elevate the level of HDL-C.  <br><br>

Example 2: Effect of WS070117 on plasma lipid in hyperlipidemia rat  <br>
Methods:<br>
2.1 Animal Modeling and Grouping<br>
After a week of accommodation, except control group (20 rat), all the rats(120 rats) were fed with high-fat laboratory chow. 4 weeks later, according to the serum cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride(TG) level, animals were divided into six groups: Simvastatin group (2mg/kg); Fenofibrate (50mg/kg); WS070117 (12mg/kg); WS070117 (6 mg/kg); WS070117 (3 mg/kg), 20 rats each group.<br>
2.2 Drug Treatment<br>
After four weeks high-fat diet modeling, rats were treated with different drugs by intragastric administration. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle.<br>
2.3 Plasma parameter analysis<br>
At the end of 4 weeks drug treatment, animals were fasted for 12 hours before anesthetizing by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitale sodium (45mg/kg), and anticoagulated by 100U/kg heparin through caudal vein injection. Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta within 15min, and serum was separated. Serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ALT, FFA were detected. Liver and the fat pad behind the belly were separated and weighed, the liver and retroperitoneal fat were weighed too. Liver SOD and MDA were detected by kit after homogenized. The left rats(10 rats each group) drug treatment was withdrawn while high-fat diet modeling continued. Two weeks later, blood sample was collected from the orbit, and serum TC, TG were detected.<br><br>
Results 1: Effects of WS070117 on plasma lipid in hyperlipidemia rats<br>
After high-fat diet feeding, blood TC, TG, LDL-C and FFA were increased, HDL-C/LDL-C was decreased, the rats experienced hyperlipidemia. After WS070117 treatment, blood TC, TG and LDL-C were decreased, HDL-C/LDL-C was increased. WS070117 had a regulation effect on blood lipid level, and WS070117 6mg/kg had a significant effect on rats FFA. (Table 1)<br>

Result 3: Effects on hepatic SOD activity and MDA content of hyperlipidemia rats<br>
The results showed that the hepatic MDA content of the rats significantly increased while the SOD activity significantly decreased after their having high-fat diets for 4 weeks. The hepatic SOD activity significantly increased after administration with simvastatin, fenofibrate and WS070117. WS070117 was indicated to have an anti-oxidant effect for the fact that it decreased hepatic MDA content (Table 3).<br>

Example 3: Effects of WS070117 on plasma lipid regulation in hyperlipidemia hamster<br>
Methods:<br>
3.1 Animal Modeling and Grouping<br>
After a week of accommodation, except control group (n=12) all the hamsters (n=72) were fed with high-fat laboratory chow. 4 weeks later, according to the serum cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride(TG) level, animals were divided into six groups: model group; Simvastatin group (2mg/kg); Fenofibrate (50mg/kg); WS070117 (12 mg/kg); WS070117 (6 mg/kg); WS070117 (3 mg/kg), 12 hamsters each group.<br>
3.2 Drug Treatment<br>
After four weeks high-fat diet modeling, rats were treated with different drugs by intragastric administration. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle.<br>
3.3 Plasma parameter analysis<br>
At the end of 4 weeks drug treatment, animals were fasted for 12 hours (10 of each group). The next day, they were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitale sodium (45mg/kg). Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta within 15min, and plasma was separated. Plasma TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ALT, FFA were detected. Liver and the retroperitoneal fat were separated and weighed, the liver and fat index were calculated. Liver SOD and MDA were detected by kit after homogenized. The left hamsters (10 each group) drug treatment was withdrawn while high-fat diet modeling continued. Two weeks later, blood sample was collected from the orbit and serum TC and TG were detected.<br><br>
Results 1: Effects of WS070117 on plasma lipid in hyperlipidemia hamsters<br>
After high-fat diet feeding, blood TC, TG, LDL-C and FFA were increased, but the rate of HDL-C/LDL-C was decreased. After WS070117 treatment, blood TC, TG and LDL-C were decreased, the rate HDL-C/LDL-C was increased. WS070117 had a regulation effect on blood lipid level. (Table 6)<br>

Result 3: Antioxidation action of WS070117 in Hyperlipidemic hamsters<br>
As shown in Table 8, compared with the control group, hamsters fed with high fat diet manifested a higher level of MDA, and the activity of SOD was significantly lower. However, MDA concentration of the hamsters treated with simvastatin, fenofibrate or WS070117 was lower than the model group, which indicated that WS070117 possesses anti-oxidative effect.<br>
