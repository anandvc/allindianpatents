IMPROVED CONTACT LESS SMART CARD READER Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to an improved contact less smart card reader and in particular, to a contact less smart card reader, having improved antenna geometry, whereby, signal to noise ratio in said reader is increased and consequently, strength and quality of signal received from a contact less smart card are increased, particularly, in the event of operation of said contact.less smart card, from a substantial operating distance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Conventional contact less smart card readers are made up of reader silicon, passive filter circuits and antenna. Smart cards operate over 13.56MHz RF frequency, based on the IS014443 or 1S015693 standard. The smart card readers transmit power to a contact less smartcard, by means of magnetic field, over the carrier frequency. Data from the smart card reader is transmitted to the contact less smartcard by means of amplitude modulation on the carrier. The contact less smart cards, internally generate power for itself, from the magnetic field generated by the reader and transmit back the data, by means of load modulation over the carrier.<br>
Most of the smart card readers kndwn in the art, use a common antenna for ■transmission and reception. When a contact less smart card remains in operation at its maximum operating distance,' in most cases, the card is able to receive enough power and respond back to commands. However, the deficiencies in geometry and structure of the antenna in the corresponding reader, results in receipt of feeble signal qualities from the card, by the reader thereby causing hindrance to reading of the card, from a substantial operating distance.<br>
 <br>
Several prior patents/patent applications exist in this field, but none of such published documents, explicitly address the issue of improving the readability of contact less smart card reader, by increasing the received signal strength particularly when, reading of the card is required to be performed, from a substantial operating distance.<br>
For example, JP 2004-328605 discloses utilization of two transmitting antenna, one receiving antenna and a switching circuit to select one of the transmitting antenna. The purpose of the covered invention, is to manage entering and leaving, with single contact less smart card reader unit. This prior art therefore does not address the aforesaid issue. Similarly, JP2000-293641 discloses, reduction in the system cost, by having one reader iC system and two antennas and reading the card, through either of the antenna. JP2002-063552 aims, at reducing the size of the overall system by antenna arrangement. WO/2007/080214, discloses how to solve the problem of contact (rust, and so on) between the electronics and the antenna, inside the reader. WO/2007/07401 discloses operation of two antennas, one operating at fixed frequency and the other operating at variable frequency. The invention covered by this document, teaches how to read data, from multiple e-VISA cards, each card transmitting 'data at different frequencies.<br>
Hence, none of the aforesaid prior art documents, address the issue of improving . the readability of contact less smart card reader, by increasing the received signal strength, particularly when, reading of the card is required to be performed, from a substantial operating distance<br>
Accordingly, there was a long felt heed to develop a contact less smart card reader, having improved antenna geometry, thereby facilitating increase in signal<br>
 <br>
qualities received from a contact less smart card by the reader particularly, in thi event of operation of said smart card from a substantial operating distance, so a to enable accurate reading of the smart card, from said substantial operating distance.<br>

It is another object of the present invention to enable accurate reading of a contact less smart card, so as to enable accurate reading of the smart card, fron-said substantial operating distance.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method for assembling a smart card reader having improved antenna geometry, for increasing the signal to noise ratio in the reader and consequently, for increasinc the signal qualities received from a smart card , particularly in the event of operation of said smart card, from a substantial operating distance.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a contact less smartcard system including atleast one contact less smartcard, having improved performance and higher operating distance and operatively coupled to atleast one contact less smartcard reader,! having improved antenna geometry, as described hereinbefore.<br>

embodiment of the present invention..	.<br>

 <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following includes description of the present invention, which is purely for the sake of understanding and not by way of any sort of limitation.<br>
As stated aforesaid, the present invention primarily aims at, increasing the signal 'qualities received from a smart card by improving the antenna geometry of the smart card reader.. This technical advancement, was hitherto unknown and not conceived by persons skilled in the art.<br>
From figure 1 and the foregoing description it ought to be clear, that the card sends data to the reader by means of load modulation on the carrier. When the card does load modulation, the total number of flux lines, those pass through the transmitting antenna of the reader, changes. This change in number efflux lines, is recognized by the reader as change in voltage and this is used to receive data from the contact less smart card.<br>
Similarly, when the card does load modulation, the total number of flux lines those pass through the card also changes. When the change in number of flux lines is analyzed in terms of ratio, this ratio measured at the card is always •greater than the ratio, measured at the transmit antenna of the reader.<br>
As can be conceived form the Figure 1 , the contact less smart card system in<br>
accordance with the invention comprises a contact less smartcard having<br>
antenna (2) inside it, in operation at a substantial distance from a contact less<br>
smart card reader having at least 6ne transmitting antenna(5) and at least one<br>
receiving antenna(4). Preferably, the transmitting antenna is larger in size than<br>
the receiving antenna and the receiving antenna is larger in size than the	;<br>
antenna of the smart card. The receiving antenna's (4) shape and size is geometrically designed, so as to capture maximum number of magnetic fk<br>
 <br>
Iines(1) those pass through the card and minimum number of flux lines(3), those do not pass through the card. This geometry, together with the dual antenna arrangement, facilitate increase in signal to noise ratio with consequential increase in strength of signal qualities received from a contact less smart card by the reader in the event of operation of said smart card from a substantial operating distance, so as to enable accurate reading of the smart card, from said substantial operating distance.<br>
The increased receiving signal strength provides, lesser number of error retry foops and thereby, also improves the performance and enables higher operating distance, for the contact less smart card.<br>
The accompanying figure 2 illustrates a flow diagram of the various components of the smart card reader, in accordance with the invention.<br>
The various components, are as follows :<br>
1)Processor(6), which issues commands to the contact less smartcard and receives the response from the smartcard. 2)Memory(7) which stores the software program, the data and ali'other relevant information to read and write into the contact less smart card. 3)'Reader IC(8) which serializes the data and converts it into frames as per IS014443 or IS015693 standards. It generates the<br>
power for the card, does modulation of the transmitted data over the carrier,<br>
i<br>
decodes the received signal and converts it back to data readable by the<br>
t<br>
processor.4)Matching circuit(9) is a passive circuit, that matches the impedance of the card to the source impedande and creates resonance to drive the power through the transmit antenna. 5)Transmit antenna(5) that transmits power by <neans of alternating magnetic field carrier wave and transmits the data to card by means modulation on wave. antenna that></neans>
 <br>
receives the signal from the card and gives it to the Reader IC through the matching filter circuit. In the accompanying figure 2, reference numeral 10 represents contact less smart card. Transmission to the smart card takes place as follows:<br>
The smart card reader generates a carrier waveform in the format of alternating magnetic field. The card uses, internal coil to convert the alternating magnetic field to electricity and uses that power for its internal operation. The smart card reader modulates the carrier waveform as per IS01443 or IS015693 standards and thus transmits data to the card. The card uses its internal coil to convert this alternating magnetic field to electricity. Since the magnetic field is modulated, the electricity generated inside the card is also modulated. The card demodulates this electric signal and receives the data for it. Reception from the card takes place as follows:<br>
When the card has to transmit data to the reader, it modulates the alternating magnetic field, by means of load modulation technique. This modulation on the magnetic field is reflected on the reader's receive antenna, as modulated electrical signal.<br>
The reader demodulates this electrical signal and uses it for receiving data from the card.<br>
When the card sends data to the reader, by means of modulating the alternating magnetic field, it is impossible for the card to modulate the entire magnetic field due to the geometry of the flux lines. Hence only some part of the magnetic flux lines are modulated and other part of the flux lines are not modulated. While receiving data from the card, if the receive antenna in the reader captures all flux lines, then the received signal strength ratio, becomes less. Whereas if the receive antenna geometry is so arranged to capture maximum number of modulated flux lines and minimum number of un modulated flux lines, !hen the received signal strength ratio is more. As the received signal strength increases, it enables the reader to read cards at larger operating distance than before. As the received signal strength increases, it enables the reader to read<br>
9<br>
 <br>
out errors caused by the external interference noises. A simple example may be taken for the purpose of proving, that more receive signal strength ratio, is achieved by the present invention. Let 1000 be the number of flux lines in total, generated by the contact less smart card reader. Now 500 may be the number of flux lines those pass through the card.<br>
Let ±10 be the change in number of flux lines inside the card due to the load<br>
modulation.<br>
If the reader either uses a single antenna for both transmit and receive, or<br>
attempts to capture all of the flux lines in the magnetic field, then received signal<br>
would.have a voltage equivalent to 1000±10. On demodulation, this is equivalent<br>
to a signal to carrier ratio of 10/1000.lf the reader uses a separate antenna for<br>
receive and if it is so designed geometrically, to capture maximum number of flux<br>
lines those pass through the card and minimum number of flux lines those do not<br>
pass though the card, say for example 600 lines, then the received signal would<br>
have a voltage equivalent to 600±10. On demodulation, this is equivalent to a<br>
signal to carrier ratio of 10/600. Obviously 10/600 is always more than 10/1000.<br>
This higher signal ratio, results in increase in operating distance and error free<br>
read / write to the card.<br>
The essential features of the invention include, a contact less smart card reader<br>
having separate antenna for transmitting and receiving, a receive coil having a<br>
geohietrical shape so as to capture maximum number of flux lines those pass<br>
through the card and minimum nunfiber of flux lines, those do not pass though the<br>
card.<br>
Preferably, the receive antenna is smaller than the transmit antenna, but bigger<br>
than the antenna size of the card.    .<br>
The number of transmitting antenna is at least one and the number of receiving<br>
antenna is at least one. This is the basic configuration used for the invention.<br>
However, the number of transmit antenna and receive antenna may be more<br>
10<br>
 <br>
than one.<br>
The present invention advocates separate antenna coil for transmission and reception. This is to ensure that the receive coil captures different number of flux lines than the number of flux lines, created by the transmit coil. The receive coil is geometrically designed so as to capture maximum number of magnetic flux lines those pass through the card and minimum number of fiux lines those do not pass through the card. Thus, the present invention creates higher received signal strength.<br>
If transmit and receive antenna are arranged on the same plane with concentric centre, then obviously the receive antenna would have a lesser size and same shape of the transmitting antenna. If both the antenna do not fall in same plane or they are not concentric, then the mathematical condition is, the receive antenna must capture maximum number of magnetic fiux lines those pass through the card and minimum number of magnetic flux lines those do not pass through the card.<br>
Fig 3 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the smart card reader in accordance . with the invention. The figure shows that the transmit antenna and receive antenna are fabricated on the same plane surface of a printed circuit board. It shows that both antennae are rectangular, with all corners curved in shape. Both antennas are concentric to the same center point. The figure 3 shows the top view of  the antenna construction.<br>
Fig 4 illustrates a further preferred embodiment of the smart card reader, in ■'accordance with the present invention. Fig 4 shows that the transmit antenna{5) and   receive antenna(4) are fabricated on two different printed circuit boards. Both antennas are rectangular, with all corners curved in shape. Both antennae are mounted on two different planes and kept concentric to the common axis(11). Transmit antenna(5) and receive antenna(4) are separated by a distance. The figure shows the side view of the printed circuit boards. There is no limitation/condition on where the contact less smart card(10) is positioned. The contact less smart card could be positioned either in between<br>
 <br>
the reader transmit antenna and reader receive antenna (or) positioned away from the reader transmit/receive antenna. In the example illustration, the card is placed in between the reader transmit antenna{5) and reader receive antenna(4).<br>
The objects of the invention are therefore achieved, by having at least two separate antenna in the reader, one for transmitting and other one for receiving such that said reader has an improved antenna geometry for increasing the signal to noise ratio in the reader and consequently, for increasing the signal T^ualities received from a smart card , particularly in the event of operation of said smart card from a substantial operating distance.<br>
