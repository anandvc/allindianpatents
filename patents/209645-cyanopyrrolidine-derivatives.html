SPECIFICATION CYANOPYRROLIDINE DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELP<br>
The present invention relates to novel cyanopyrrolidine derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) is a kind of serine proteases which can hydrolyze the dipeptide from the peptide chain having proline or alanine at the second position from the N-terminus. DPP IV is distributed in a variety of the tissues (including kidney or liver) and plasma, and participates in the metabolisms of various physiologically active peptides.<br>
Recently, it has been made clear that DPP IV acts on the metabolism of glucagon-like peptide-l (GLP-1). That is, DPP IV hydrolyzes the dipeptide of the N-terminal His-Ala of GLP-1, thereby, GLP-1 is inactivated, and the inactivated product acts as an antagonist of GLP-1 receptor.<br>
GLP-1 has been found to have physiological actions such as an accelerating action of insulin-secretion from the pancreas, a prolonging action of gastric emptying time or an inhibitory action of eating. Accordingly, DPP IV inhibition elevates the GLP-1 effect, enhances the insulin effect and improves glucose metabolism, therefore, DPP IV inhibition is expected to be useful for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus.<br>
In addition, DPP IV has been found to participate in the metabolism of neuropeptide Y which is a kind of<br><br>
neuropeptides, activation of T cells which are immunocompetent cells, adhesion of cancer cells to the endothelium or invasion of HIV virus into lymphocytesâ€¢ Accordingly, DPP IV inhibition is considered to be useful for treating immune diseases, etc.<br>
Furthermore, a high level of DPP IV expression has been found in fibroblasts of the skin of human subjects of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lichen planus, and a high DPP IV activity has been found in the subjects of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Accordingly, DPP IV inhibition is also expected to be effective to skin diseases and benign prostatic hypertrophy.<br>
Among DPP IV inhibiting compounds which have been known up to this time, there are the compounds which are substituted with a phosphorus atom .at the 2-position of pyrrolidine (J. Med. Chem., 37, 3969 - 3976, 1994), and the compounds which are substituted with a boron atom at the 2-position of pyrrolidine (Biochemistry, 32, 8723 - 8731, 1993). Also are known the compounds which are substituted with a cyano group at the 2-position of pyrrolidine (Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 323, 148 - 152, 1995; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 6., 1163 - 1166, 1996; Biochemistry, 38, 11597 -11603, 1999), but there is no report on any inhibitors which have substituent(s) at the 3- or 4-position of 2-cyanopyrrolidine derivatives.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide novel cyanopyrrolidine derivatives which have an excellent DPP IV inhibition activity.<br><br>

Experiment 1 [Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV Activity Inhibition Test]<br>
An activity inhibition test of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) was carried out according to the method described in Diabetes, 47, 764 - 769 (1998).  Plasma including dipeptidyl peptidase IV was prepared by centrifugation of blood collected from healthy human volunteers. Enzyme reaction was carried out using a plate with 96 flat bottom wells in the buffer solution containing 25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl and 1% BSA, pH 7.8. To a mixture of 25 Î¼l  of 100 Î¼M  Gly-Pro-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide solution (manufactured by Peptide Institute, Inc.), 7.5 Î¼l  of 133 mM magnesium chloride solution and 5 \xl  of the test compound was added 12.5 Î¼l of plasma which was diluted to 1/100 with the above buffer solution. After the reaction at room temperature for 2 hours, 50 Î¼l of 25% aqueous acetic acid solution was added to stop the reaction. The fluorescence intensity of the liberated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarine was<br><br>
determined by using a fluorescence plate reader (1420 ARVOTM Multilabel Counter; manufactured by Wallac Oy, Excitation: 390 nm. Emission: 460 nm) . The fluorescence intensity at which the reaction time of the vehicle addition was 0 minute was regarded as a blank value, and the specific fluorescence intensity was calculated by subtracting the blank value from the determined value. The inhibition rate (%) of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity was calculated from the resulting specific fluorescence intensity according to the following formula. The dimethyl sulfoxide solution containing the test compound at high concentration of 1000-fold was prepared and diluted with the above-mentioned buffer solution for use. The concentration (IC50) of the test compound to exhibit 50% inhibition was calculated from the -inhibition rate at each concentration.<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = A/Bx100<br>
(A= fluorescence intensity of vehicle addition -fluorescence intensity of the test compound addition)<br>
(B = fluorescence intensity of the vehicle addition)<br>
As the comparative drugs were used 1-[(2S,3S)-2-amino- 3-methylpentanoyl]-2-(S)-cyanopyrrolidine trifluoroacetate (Compound A) described in Patent WO95A5309 and l-[2-[ (5-cyanopyridin-2-yl)amino]ethylamino]acetyl-2-(S)-cyanopyrrolidine dihydrochloride (Compound B) described Patent W098/19998 or US. Patent 6011155.<br>
Results are shown in Table 1. The compounds of the<br><br>
present invention are confirmed to have an enhancing activity by introducing a fluorine atom on the pyrrolidine ring, and confirmed to have an excellent DPP IV inhibition activity.<br><br>

At 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes, 1 and 2 hours after the administration, each 0.2 ml of blood was collected from the jugular vein and, after centrifugation, the resulting plasma was used as sample.<br>
Concentrations of the compound of Example 1 and<br><br>
Compound A in plasma were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrography method (LC/MS/MS). That is, 50 Î¼l of the plasma was added to 200 \xl  of acetonitrile, stirred and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was injected to a liquid chromatography wherein CAPCEL PAK C18, UG120 5 Î¼m (150 mm long, 2 mm diameter) was used as a column, a mixture of 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution and 90% aqueous acetonitrile solution (1:9) was used as an eluent, Sciex API3000 LC/MS/MS System (Perkin Elmer Sciex) was used as a MS/MS condition, ESI was used as an ionization method, and cation, and SRM (precursor ion and daughter ion) was used for monitoring.

An OGTT in Zucker fatty rats was carried out referring to the method described in Diabetologia, 42, 1324 - 1331 (1999). In the test, male Zucker fatty rats, 10 weeks old (Charles River Japan, Inc.) were used after fasting for 16 hours. Rats had free access to water up to the time just before the test, and did not have up to the end of the test. Before the begining of the test, blood was collected from the intraorbital vein using a heparin-treated tube for blood collection (manufactured by Drummond Scientific Co.). The test compounds were each dissolved in water for injection under Japanese Pharmacopoeia (manufactured by Hikari Pharmaceutical Co.) and orally administered in an amount of 2 ml/kg of the body weight. The same amount of water for injection under Japanese Pharmacopoeia only was administered to control group. One g/kg of the body weight of glucose was dissolved in water for injection under Japanese Pharmacopoeia and orally administered in an amount of 2 ml/kg of the body weight at 30 minutes after the administration of the test compound or water for injection. Blood was collected from the ophthalmic vein at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the glucose administration. Blood samples were immediately mixed with heparin (manufactured by Shimizu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4Â°C to recover plasmas, which were immediately frozen.<br>
Plasma glucose levels of the frozen samples (mg/dl)<br><br>
were determined using Glucose CII test Wako (manufactured by Wako Fine Chemical Industry Co.), and the area under the curve (min-mg/dl) was calculated from the plasma glucose levels which were determined from the blood collected for 60 minutes after the glucose administration. On the other hand, the plasma glucose level of the sample which was obtained from the blood collected before the beginning of the test was used as substitutes for the plasma glucose level at 0 minute.<br>
Results are shown in Table 3. The compound of Example 1 inhibited significantly the elevation of the plasma glucose level (p
