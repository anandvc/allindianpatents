Each display design is configured to display various kinds of alarms and operation states by lighting and blinking using the light source which is arranged on the back surface side of the display board 40. Here, a window portion 34 to which an odometer which indicates an integrated distance faces is formed on the speedometer display portion 40a,<br>
Fig. 5 is a front view of the light guide member 50. The light guide member 50 is constituted by integrally forming an annular portion 50a having an opening window 51 and a flat plate portion 50b having an opening window 52. In this embodiment, when the light guide member 50 is arranged on the front surface side of the display board 40, most of the speedometer display portion 40a faces the outside through the opening window 51 and, at the same time, a scale display of every 20km/h is arranged on a lower portion of the annular portion 50a. The light guide member 50 is formed of a member to which smoke treatment is applied for reducing a light transmission ratio than a light transmission ratio of the protective cover 32 and the like. For example, the light guide member 50 maybe formed of a colored-and-transparent acrylic resin or the like having a smoking effect or an acrylic resin to which coating which exhibits a smoking effect is applied. Further, the display board 40, the light guide plate 33 and the light guide member 50 are joined to each other by a thread connection which uses<br><br>
threaded holes 53, 54 formed in an end portion of the flat plate portion 50b and by heat welding at a projecting portion (see Fig. 6) formed on the back surface side of the light guide member 50. Here, by providing a projecting portion for heat welding to the portions where the threaded holes 53, 54 are formed, the light guide member 50 may be fixed at three points by heat welding.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line A-A in Fig. 4 and Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line B-B in Fig. 4. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. On a bottom portion of the casing 31, a speedometer drive device 42 which drives the indicator 35 of the speedometer, a fuel-gauge drive device 43 which drives an indicator 37 of the fuel gauge and the illumination-use first bulb 41 which uses an incandescent lamp are mounted. To a plug 44 of the speedometer drive device 42, another end portion of a speedometer cable (not shown in the drawing) which transmits the number of rotation of the front wheel WF is connected. Due to such a constitution, the indicator 35 and the odometer 45 are driven. Here, to the fuel-gauge drive device 43, a wiring cord (not shown in the drawing) which transmits information from a sensor arranged in the inside of a fuel tank is connected.<br><br>
The display board 40 on which various kinds of design displays are displayed is arranged above the speedometer drive device 42 and the fuel-gauge drive device 43. Further, the flat-plate type light guide plate 33 is arranged on the back surface side of the display board 40 and the light guide member 50 (see Fig. 5) is arranged on the front surface side of the display board 40 and hence, a rider can visually recognize the display designs of the display board 40 at the portion where the light guide member 50 is arranged in a light emitting state different from a light emitting state of the portion where the light guide member 50 is not arranged. In this embodiment, the annular portion 50a of the light guide member 50 includes an arched cross section and is arranged on the display board 40 in a state that a top portion of the annular portion 50a is directed upwardly and hence, the annular portion 50a functions as a lens thus enabling the rider to visually recognize the scale portion which is arranged below the annular portion 50a in a stereoscopic manner. Further, the smoke treatment is applied to the annular portion 50a and hence, the luminosity and the color tone of the emitted light of the annular portion 50a are lowered than the luminosity and the color tone of the surrounding thus allowing the annular portion 50a to obtain light having a quiet tone and, at the same time, to intensify a contrast with a portion to which the light guide member 50 is not provided.  Due to the above-mentioned<br><br>
constitution, the stereoscopic feeling of the measuring instrument display device as a whole can be increased and, at the same time, it is possible to obtain the unique design property and hence, it is possible to increase the feeling of sophistication of the measuring instrument display device and the merchantability of the measuring instrument display device brought about by the sophistication. Further, the light guide member 50 forms the projecting portion 55 on the back surface side of the substantially center portion thereof, and the display board 40, the light guide plate 33 and the light guide member 50 can be joined to each other on the projecting portion 55 by heat welding. Due to such a constitution, there is no possibility that threaded holes for joining are viewed at a substantially center portion of the front surface side of the light guide member 50 thus enhancing the appearance of the light guide member 50.<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line C-C in Fig. 4. In the measuring instrument display device 30 according to this embodiment, for allowing the light guide member 50 and the light guide plate 33 to emit light as indirect lightning bodies, three bulbs in total are provided separately from the above-mentioned alarm-use lamps. The first bulb 41 which is arranged at a substantially center of the measuring instrument display device 30 supplies radiated light to a first<br><br>
end surface 46 which is formed on an end portion of the light guide plate 33 and/ at the same time, supplies radiated light from a back surface side of the annular portion 50a of the light guide member 50.<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line D-D in Fig. 4 . The second bulb 49 which is arranged on a left upper side of the measuring instrument display device 30 is configured to supply radiated light to a second end surface 47 which is formed on an end portion of the light guide plate 33 and the annular portion 50a. Here, the radiated light which is supplied to the annular portion 50a of the bulb is scattered in the various directions in the inside of the annular portion 50a and hence, it is possible to allow the whole light guide member 50 to emit light only with the use of the first bulb 41. Here, on the left side of the second bulb 49, a bulb (not shown in the drawing) for blinking the left-side blinker operation display lamps 37L is provided and hence, a wall surface of the casing 31 is extended until the wall surface is brought into contact with the display board 40 so as to function as a light shielding wall.<br>
Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line E-E in Fig. 4. A right side of the first bulb 41 is configured such that the radiated light is supplied to the light guide<br><br>
plate 33 from a third end surface 48. Due to such a constitution, the fuel-gauge display portion 40b emits light. Here, on the right side of the measuring instrument display device 30, a third bulb not shown in the drawing is provided, and the third bulb is configured to allow the light guide plate 33 to emit light using the constitution as same as the constitution of the first bulb 41. Here, to the above-mentioned bulbs, a light emitting diode may be used in place of the incandescent lamp.<br>
As described above, according to the measuring instrument display device of the present invention, the measuring instrument display device includes the light guide member which forms the annular portion having the arched cross section in which a top portion of the annular portion is directed to a side remote from the front surface of the display board thereon and to which smoke treatment is applied. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the stereoscopic feeling and the depth feeling of the design display which is arranged on the lower portion of the light guide member and, at the same time, a contrast between the portion which is covered with the light guide member and a portion which is not covered with the light guide member can be intensified and hence, it is possible to obtain the unique design property. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the feeling of sophistication of the measuring instrument display device and<br><br>
the merchantability of the measuring instrument display device brought about by the sophistication.<br>
Here, it is needless to say that the shapes of the light guide member and the light guide plate, and the arrangement and shapes of the design displays are not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment and various modifications are conceivable - For example, the light guide member may be formed of two annular portions and the speedometer and the tachometer may be arranged on lower portions of the respective annular portions.<br>
Fig. 11 is a front view of a headlight unit 60, and Fig. 12 is a plan view of a headlight unit 60. The two-bulb type headlight unit 60 is mounted on the front cover 24 (see Fig. 1) of the motorcycle 1 using upper mounting stays 61a, 61a and lower mounting stays 61b, 61b which are formed on a housing 61. The headlight unit 60 is configured to accommodate a pair of left and right integral inner reflectors (see Fig. 14) between the housing 61 and a cover lens 62. On the inner reflectors, main reflector portions 64L, 64R to which headlight bulbs 66L, 66R are provided are formed, while blinker reflector portions 65L, 65R to which blinker bulbs 67L, 67R are provided are formed on outer-lower portions of the respective inner reflectors.  Further, the cover lens 62 is an integrally formed<br><br>
part which is formed of a colorless-and-transparent acrylic resin or the like, and the cover lens 62 is configured such that only left and right reflector portions can be observed by applying black coating or the like to a hatched portion in the drawing except for left and right lens portions 62L, 62R.<br>
On a center lower end portion of the front side housing 62, a holder 63 in which a working tool insertion opening 63a which is used in rocking the inner reflectors is formed is mounted. The inner reflectors are rocked about rocking center portions 70L, 70R. Accordingly, it is possible to adjust optical axes of the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R. In this embodiment, since a battery 69 is arranged on a back surface side of the housing 61, sockets (see Fig. 14) of the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R and socket covers 68L, 68R which protect the sockets are arranged in a state that the sockets and the socket covers 68L, 68R are respectively largely spaced-apart from each other in the lateral direction.<br>
Fig. 13 is a back view of the headlight unit 60. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. On the rear housing 61, a dial 72 which includes a rotary shaft 71 and forms a gear-teeth-like corrugation on an outer peripheral portion thereof is mounted. The inner reflectors are configured to be rocked corresponding<br><br>

Further, wiring cords 73L, 73R which supply power to the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R are respectively connected to the socket covers 68L, 68R, while wiring cords 74L, 74R which supply power to the blinker bulbs 67L, 67R are respectively connected to the sockets 82L,82R.<br>
Fig. 14 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line F-F in Fig. 11. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. To bottom portions of the main reflector portions 64L, 64R which are formed on left and right sides of the inner reflector 75, a socket 85L which supports the left headlight bulb 66L and a socket 85R which supports the right headlight bulb 66R are respectively provided. In the inner reflector 75 according to this embodiment, a center portion thereof is largely projected to a front side of the vehicle body for arranging the battery 69 on the back surface side of the headlight unit 60. Accordingly, sizes of the main reflector portions 64L, 64R in the vehicle width direction are limited and hence, in the straight structure which mounts the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R straightly on the inner reflector 75 from the back surface side of the inner reflector 75 along the vehicle-body longitudinal direction, it is difficult to obtain an effective reflector shape.<br><br>
With respect the above-mentioned drawback, in this embodiment, the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R are arranged close to the vehicle body center and, at the same time, are mounted in a state that the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R are directed in the vehicle-width outward direction with a predetermined angle. Accordingly, inclinations of paraboloidal surfaces which constitute the main reflector portions 64L, 64R can be decreased (openings of the paraboloidal surfaces are increased) and hence, it is possible to obtain proper reflector shapes. Due to the above-mentioned constitution, by allowing the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R to largely project toward inside of the main reflector portion 64L, 64R, that is, by increasing distances (focal lengths) between top points of the paraboloidal surfaces and light emitting portions of the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R, it is possible to ensure large light emitting surfaces. Further, rear end portions of the sockets 85L, 85R are shifted to the front side of the vehicle body due to the inclination of the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R and hence, it is possible to reduce the longitudinal size of the headlight unit 60. Further, due to the above-mentioned constitution, even when the focal lengths are increased, the sockets 85L, 85R are not embedded into the back surface portions of the main reflector portion 64L, 64R and hence, an exchange operation of the headlight bulbs 66L, 66R is not influenced. Here, in a vehicle-body-front-side recessed portion of the cover lens<br><br>
62, a nose cover 24a which constitutes one of exterior parts is arranged at the time of mounting the headlight unit 60 on the front cover 24.<br>
Fig. 15 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line G-G in Fig. 11 and Fig. 16 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line H-H in Fig. 11. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. The rotary shaft 71 on which the dial 72 is mounted is threadedly engaged with a thread mechanism 83 which is fixed to the back surface portions of the inner reflector 75. Further, when the rotary shaft 71 whose axial movement is restricted is rotated by the dial 72, the inner reflector 75 is moved in the axial direction of the rotary shaft 71 with respect to the casing 61 and hence, it is possible to rock the inner reflector 75 about rocking centers 70 (L, R) . Here, the sockets 82L, 82R are respectively mounted on the housing 61 and hence, even when the inner reflector 75 is rocked, there is no possibility that the blinker bulbs 67L, 67R are moved. Further, the blinker reflector portions 65L, 65R are largely offset in the direction toward the front side of the vehicle body compared to the main reflector portions 64L, 64R.<br>
Fig. 17 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line I-I in Fig. 11 and Fig. 18 is a cross-sectional view taken along<br><br>
a line J-J in Fig. 11. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. To the rocking centers 70L, 70R of the inner reflector 75, a ball joint mechanism is applied. The ball joint mechanism is configured to allow a male member 76 which is joined to the housing 61 and a female member 77 which is joined to the inner reflector 75 to engage with each other. Further, in this embodiment, the dial 72 is configured to be manipulated using a plus driver 80 which is inserted from the vehicle-body front side. When the driver 80 is inserted through the working tool insertion opening 63a of the holder 63 which is formed on the lower end portion of the housing 61, a distal end of the driver 80 is engaged with the gear-teeth-like corrugations of the dial 72 along a guide 78. Due to such a constitution, without using a special-use tool, it is possible to easily carry out the adjustment of the optical axis of the headlight using the plus driver which is a tool having high general-purpose property.
