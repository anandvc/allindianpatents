Description AMPHIPHILIC   BLOCK   COPOLYMER   AND   POLYMERIC COMPOSITION   COMPRISING   THE   SAME   FOR   DRUG<br>
DELIVERY<br>
[i]<br>
[2]	TECHNICAL   FIELD<br>
[3]<br>
[4]	This invention relates to an amphiphilic Hock copolymer comprising a hydrophilic<br>
A Hock and a hydrophobic B Hock with a terminal hydroxyl group, wherein said termini hydroxyl group of the hydrophobic Hock is substituted with a tocopherol or cholesterol group. The invention further relates to a polymeric composition comprising said amphiphilic block copolymer and a polylactic acid derivative wherein one or more ends of the polylactic acid are covalently bound to at least one carboxyl group. It stil further relates to a metal ion-fixed polymeric composition, wherein the carboxyl terming group of the polylactic acid derivative is fixed with a di- or tri-valent metal ion.<br>
[5]<br>
[6]	BACKGROUND   ART<br>
[7]<br>
[8]	When a drug is administered into the body, only a small amount of the drag may<br>
reach its target site and most of the administered dose is distributed to non-targeted sites and may cause undesirable side effects. Therefore, in the last two decades, research has focused on the development of systems efficient for site specific delivery of drugs by the use of appropriate earners, which include liposomes, small molecular surfactant miceles, polymeric nanopartides, and polymeric miceles (polymeric nanopartides made of hardened miceles). The use of liposomes as drug carriers has been found to be limited mainly due to such problems as low entrapment efficiency, drug instability, rapid drug leakage, and poor storage stability. Small molecular surfactant miceles are easily dissociated when they are diluted in body fluids after having been administered into the body, and therefore it is difficult for them to sufficiently act as drug carriers.<br>
[9]	Recently, polymeric nanopartides and polymeric miceles using biodegradable<br>
polymers have been reported to be extremely useful technologies for overcoming these problem. They change the in vivo distribution of an intravenously administered drug<br><br>
thereby reducing its side effects and improving its efficacy thereby offering such advantages as eel specific targeting and control of the release of the drug. They also have good compatibility with body fluids and improve the solubility and bioavailability of pooriy water-soluble drugs.<br>
[10]	Nanometer size drug carriers with hydrophilic surfaces have been found to evade<br>
recognition and uptake by the reticulo-endothelid systems(RES), and thus to circulate in the Hood for a long period of time. Another advantage of these hydrophilic nanopartides is that, due to their extremely small size, the partides extravagate at the pathological sites, such as solid tumors, through a passive targeting mechanism. However, successful drug delivery to the specific target site requires stable retention of the drug by a carrier while in the circulation. Since drug targeting appears to require a long circulation time and the carrier is exposed to blood components for a long period of time, the stability of a drug-carrier association needs to be improved over that of carriers that are rapidly deared.<br>
[11]	Among the nanometer size drug carriers with hydrophilic surfaces, polymeric<br>
micelles usually consist of several hundreds of block copolymers and have a diameter of about 20 nm to 50 nm. The polymeric miceles have two sphericd co-centric regions, a densely packed core of hydrophobic material which is responsible for entrapping the hydrophobic drug, and an outer shel made of hydrophilic materid for evasion of the body's RES which permits circulation in the Hood for a longer period of time. In spite of their distinct advantages such as small size, high solubility, simple sterilization, and controlled drug release, the physical stability of these carriers is a critical issue since the rapid release of the incorporated drug may occur in vivo.<br>
[12]	Miceles are thermodynamically stable if the total copolymer concentration is<br>
above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Thus, the use of a copolymer system with a low CMC vdue may increase the in vivo stability of the micelles. The kinetic stability means the rate of disassembly of a micele. The rate of disassembly depends upon the physicd state of the micele core. Miceles formed from copolymers cont aining a hydrophobic block which has a high glass transition temperature will tend to disassemble more slowly than those with a low glass transition temperature. They are also likely to be affected by many of the same factors that affect the rate of unimer exchange between miceles. The unimer exchange rate has been found to be dependent on many factors such as the content of solvent within the core, the hydrophobic content of the copolymer, and the lengths of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks.<br><br>
[13]	Great efforts have been devoted to the development of a biodegradatle and bio-<br>
compatible core-shel type drug carrier with improved stability and efficacy, which wil entrap a poody water-solutie drug. A preparation method of chemicaly fixing polymeric miceles, wherein the polymer is a core-shel type polymer comprising a hy-drophilic polyethjiene oxide as the shel and a hydrophobic biodegradable polymer that is cross-linked in an aqueous solution as the core, was disdosed in EP 0,552,802A2. However, these polymeric miceles are difficult to prepare because a cross linker must be introduced into the hydrophobic component of the A-B type di-block or A-B-A type tri-block copolymer so that the core-forming polymer has a stable structure. Also, using a cross linker that has never been used before in a human body raises safety concerns.<br>
[14]	A micele forming block copolymer-drug complex was disdosed in US Patent No.<br>
6,080,396. The high molecular block copolymer-drug complex in which the high molecular weight block copolymer, having a hydrophilic polymer segment and a hydrophobic polymer segment, forms a micele having the hydrophilic segment as its outer shel and contains an anthracydine anticancer agent in its hydrophobic inner core. The molecules of the anticancer agent are covaiently linked within the micelar core. However, when the drug is covaiently linked within the polymeric miceles, it is difficult to control the deavage rate of the drug-copolymer linkage.<br>
[15]<br>
[16]	On the other hand, a report shows that the solubilization of a hydrophobic drug can<br>
be achieved by a polymeric micele composed of a di- or tri-block copolymers comprising a hydrophilic polymer of polyaklene gjycol derivatives and a hydrophobic biodegradatle polymer such as fatty acid polyesters or polyamino acids. US Patent No. 5,449,513 disdoses a di-block copolymer comprising polyethylene glycol as the hydrophilic polymer, and a polyamino acid derivative, e.g. polybenzyl aspartic acid, etc., as the hydrophobic polymer. This di-block copolymer can solubilize hydrophobic anticancer agents, e.g. doxorubicin, or anti-inflammatory agents, e.g. in-domethacin. However, the polyamino acid derivative cannot be hydrolyzed in vivo, and thus causes side effects due to immune responses that are triggered.<br>
[17]	One approach to improve the stability of polymeric miceles is to increase the hy-<br>
drophobicity of the polymer. To do so, the molecular weight or the concentration of the polymer should be adjusted. However, as the molecular weight is increased, its biodegradability is decreased, and so the polymer is poody excreted from the body and accumulates in organs causing toxic effects therein. US Patent No. 5,429,826 disdoses<br><br>
a di- or multi-block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polyskylene glycol and a hydrophobic polyiactic acid. Specificaly, this patent describes a method of stabilizing polymeric miceles by micelizing a di- or multi-block copolymer wherein an acrylic acid derivative is bonded to a terming group of the di- or multi-block copolymer, and then, in an aqueous solution, the polymer is crosslinked in order to form the miceles. The above method could accomphsh stabilization of the polymeric micele, but the crosslinked polymer is not degraded, and thus, cannot be apjiied for in vivo use. The above polymeric miceles can solubilize a large amount of pooily water-soluHe drug in an aqueous solution with a neutral pH, but have the drawback that the drug is released within a short period of time. Also, in US Patent No. 6,458,373, a poody water-soluHe drug is solubilized into the form of an emulsion with a-tocopherol. According to this patent, to stabilize the emulsion, PEGylated vitamin E is used as a surfactant. PEG)iated vitamin E has a similar structure to the amphiphilic block copolymer comprised of a hydrophilic block and a hydrophobic block, and the highly hydrophobic tocopherol increases the copolymer's affinity with a poody water-soluble drug, and thus, it can solubilize the poody water-soluble drug. However, polyethylene gycol used as the hydrophilic polymer has a limited molecular weight, and so PEG).ated vitamin E done can solubilize a hydrophobic drug such as paditaxel only up to 2.5 mg/raL At 2.5 mg/ni or more, unstaHe miceles are formed, and the drug crystds are likely to form precipitates.<br>
Clinicd tumor resistance to chemotherapy can be inherent or acquired. Inherent resistance is present in the tumors that fail to respond to the first-line chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis. Acquired resistance occurs in the tumors that are often highly responsive to the initid treatment, but on recurrence, exhibit an entirely different phenotype. The resistance can be formed to both previously used drugs and new drugs with different structures and mechanisms of action. For example, cancer chemotherapy with Taxol often fails due to the acquired resistance of cancer eels, which is<br>
frequently associated with the overexpression of P-gp and iteration of b -tubulin.<br>
® Taxol resistant cells exhibit cross-resistance to other drugs including actinomycin D,<br>
doxorubicin, vinHastine, and vincristine. Therefore, dinical drug resistance is a major<br>
barrier to be overcome before chemotherapy can be curative for patients with<br>
metastatic cancer.<br>
Drug-resistant cancer eels show a higher YZ    (50% eel inhibition concentration of<br>
drug), and so for chemotherapy to be effective a higher concentration of drugs is<br>
needed for the tumor cells while reduced drug concentration is desired for the normal<br><br>
eels. Therefore, longer systemic circulation and specific localization of drugs in the tumor tissues are required for improving the effectiveness against drug-resistant cancers.<br>
[20]	In view of the foregoing, the development of an improved polymeric micele<br>
composition for hydrophobic drug delivery that is biocompatiUe and biodegradaUe has been appreciated and desired. The present invention provides such an improved polymeric micele composition which is biocompatiUe and biodegradaUe, and can effective!/ deliver a hydrophobic drug without a decrease in its stability.<br>
[21]<br>
[22]	SUMMARY   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
[23]<br>
[24]	One aspect of the present invention relates to an amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
comprising a hydrophilic A Uodc and a hydrophobic B block with a termind hydroxyl group, wherein said terminal hydroxy; group of the hydrophobic block is substituted with a tocopherol or cholesterol group, and to a preparation process thereof. The amphiphilic block copolymer of the present invention has remarkally increased hy-drophobicity of the hydrophobic block while maintaining almost the same molecular weight as the native polymer. Also, the hydrophobic functional group remarkaUy improves affinity with a poorly water-soluHe drug, and thus polymeric miceles formed from the polymer are more staUe in aqueous solutions, and can maintain the pooriy water-soluHe drug solubilized therein at an increased plasma concentration for an extended period of time. Furthermore, the amphiphilic block copolymer may be mixed with other polymers, and be prepared into a polymeric composition for drug delivery.<br>

[26]	The third aspect of the present invention relates to a polymeric composition<br>
comprising an amphiphilic block copolymer of a hydrophilic A block and a hydrophobic B block with a terminal hydroxjl group, and a polylactic acid derivative, wherein said terminal hydroxyl terminal group of the hydrophobic B block is substituted with a tocopherol or cholesterol group, and at least one end of the<br><br>
polylactic acid derivative is covdently bound to at least one carboxyl group, wherein the carboxyl terminal group of the polylactic acid derivative is fixed with a di- or tri-vaJent metal ion.<br>
[27]	The polymeric compositions of the present invention can form stable polymeric<br>
miceles or nanopartides in body fluids or aqueous solutions. The miceles or nanopartides formed from the compositions of the present invention have a hy-drophilic outer shel and a hydrophobic inner core wherein a large amount of hydrophobic drug can be physicdly trapped.

[90]	The term "a carboxjlated hydrophobic compound" refers to a hydrophobic<br>
compound with a hydroxyl group to which a carboxyl group is bound, and the carboxyl group may be derived from succinate, mdonate, gutarate, or adipate.<br>
[91]	The present invention also provides a drug carrier comprising the amphiphilic<br>
block copolymer of the present invention. It also provides a pharmaceutical composition capade of forming polymeric miceles in a body fluid or an aqueous solution, comprising said amphiphilic dock copolymer and a poorly water-solude drug.<br>
[92]	The amphiphilic dock copolymer of the present invention is preferady an A-B<br>
type didock copolymer or B-A-B type tridock copolymer comprising a hydrophilic A dock and a hydrophobic B dock, and the terminal group of the hydrophobic block: is a hydroxyl group. The amphiphilic dock copolymer of the present invention, when place ed in an aqueous environment, forms a core-shel type of polymeric micele wherein the hydrophobic B dock forms the core and the hydrophilic A dock forms the shel. Preferady, the hydrophilic A dock is a member selected from the group consisting of polyalklence glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacryl amide, and derivatives thereof. More preferably, the hydrophilic A dock is a member selected from the group consisting of monomethoxypolyethyiene glyycol, monoacetoxy-polyethylene gycol, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene-co-propylene glycol, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Preferady, the hydrophilic A dock has a number average molecular weight of 200 to 50,000 Dions . More preferady, the hydrophilic A block has a number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 20,000 Dions .<br>
[93]	The hydrophobic B dock of the amphiphilic dock copolymer of the present<br>
invention is a highly biocompatide and biodegradable polymer selected from the group consisting of polyesters, polyanhydrides, polyamino acids, polyorthoesters and polyphosphate. More preferady, the hydrophobic B dock is one or more selected from the group consisting of polylactides, polyglyycolides, polycaprolactone, polydioxan-2-one, pol)iactic-co-glycolide, polyiactic-co-dioxan-2-one, polylactic-co-caprolactone and polyglycolic-co-caprolactone. Preferady, the hydrophobic B dock of the amphiphilic dock copolymer has a number average molecular weight of 50 to 50,000 Dions . More preferady, the hydrophobic B dock of the amphiphilic<br><br>
dock copolymer has a number average molecular weight 200 to 20,000 Dalons .<br>
[94]	The hydrophobic B Hock has a hydroxyl termind group, and the hydroxyl terming<br>
group is substituted with tocopherol or cholesterol both having excelent hy-drophobicity, which increases the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic B Hock. When placed in an aqueous solution, the hydrophobic Hock of the amphiphilic Hock copolymer of the present invention avoids contact with water, and forms an inner core, to form a sphericd polymeric micele. Thus, when a pooriy water-soluHe drug is introduced into the amphiphilic Hock copolymer, the pooriy water-soluHe drug is surrounded by the hydrophobic polymer, the inner core of the polymeric micele, and thus, can be entrapped within the micele. The stability of the formed micele depends on the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic Hock and its affinity with the drug. Therefore, in the present invention, in order to increase the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic Hock while maintaining its molecular weight, a functional group with excelent hydrophobicity, e.g. tocopherol, cholesterol, etc. is chemicaly bound thereto using a linkage agent. Tocopherol and cholesterol are biological compatiHe and hydrophobic compounds having a ring structure, which can increase the affinity of the Hock copolymer with a pooriy water-soluHe drug.<br>
[95]	The ratio of the hydrophilic A Hock to the hydrophobic B Hock of the amphiphilic<br>
Hock copolymer of the present invention is preferably within the range of 30:70 to 97:3 by weight, and more preferaHy within the range of 4:6 to 7:3. If the co ntent of the hydrophilic A block is too low, the polymer may not form polymeric miceles in an aqueous solution, and if the content is too high, the polymeric miceles formed therefrom are not stable.<br>
[96]	In one embodiment, the amphiphilic Hock copolymer of the present invention may<br><br><br>

[105]	X' is an integer from 0-4.<br>
[106]	As compared with prior amphiphilic block copolymers, the copolymer with the hy-<br>
drophobic group-substituted hydrophobic block of the present invention has increased hydrophobicity, a decreased critical micele concentration (CMC), and increased affinity with a pooriy water-soluble drug, and thus, contains the drug in a staUe environment. Furthermore, the size of the miceles formed in an aqueous solution is increased due to the functional group bound at the end, and thus, a sufficient amount of drug can be contained in the micele. Therefore, the amphiphilic dock copolymer can be efficiently used as a drug carrier. The function^ group with strong hydrophobicity introduced in the present invention has a high molecular-weight; thus it can remarkaUy increase both the hydrophobicity and the affinity of the block copolymer with the drug and thus significantly stabilize the drug containing miceles.<br>
[107]	In addition, the polymeric micele formed from the amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
of the present invention has a prolonged in vivo retention time. The Hood concentration of the drug in the polymeric miceles depends on hydrophobic moiety substituted for the hydroxy; termind group of hydrophobic B block of the amphiphilic diblock copolymers. As shown in TaUe 6 and Fig. 8, the polymeric miceles (Compositions 1-2) of the amphiphilic block copolymers with a hydrophobic moiety (tocopherol or cholesterol) substituted for the hydroxyl terminal group of hydrophobic B block had a much longer bloodstream retention time than the original mPEG-ELA-OH polymeric miceles (Composition 3). Moreover, mPEG-ILA-tocopherol miceles (Composition 1) circulated longest in the Uood among al the polymeric miceles. This result can be explained by the increased hydrophobicity of tocopherol and cholesterol moiety in the hydrophobic B block.<br>
[108]	The block copolymer having the hydrophobic block whose hydroxyl termini<br>
group is substituted with tocopherol or cholesterol can be prepared according to the folowing methods. In one embodiment, a suitaUe linker, e.g. a dicarboxjiic acid such as succinic acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid or adipic acid, is introduced into the hydroxyl group of tocopherol or cholesterol, and the carboxylated tocopherol or cholesterol is chemicaly bound to the hydroxyl terminal group of the hydrophobic B block.<br><br>
[109]	In one embodiment, according to the method of US Patent No. 6,322,805, the am-<br>
phiphilic block copolymer (mPEG-ILA) comprised of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG; Mn=20,000) and polylactide (ILA; Mn=l,750) is weighed, and dehydrated using a vacuum pump at 120 °C, and then dissolved in acetonitrile or methjiene chloride. Thereto is added tocopherol succinate or cholesterol succinate, and dicydohexjfcarbodiimide (DCC) and 4-dimethyIarrrinopyridine (DM\P) are weighed and added thereto as an initiator and a catalyst, respectively, and the reaction is performed at room temperature. The reactant becomes opaque due to dicydo-hexjiurea (DCU) formed in the reaction between the termind -OH of mPEGJLA and ■COOH of the hydrophobic compound. After 24 hours, DCU is removed by using a glass filter, and DMAP is extracted and removed with a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution. To this purified product solution is added MgSO to remove any residual<br>
4<br>
moisture, and then, precipitates are formed in a hexane/diethji ether solvent in order to obtain the amphiphilic block copolymer to which tocopherol succinji or cholesterol succinyl is bound, mPEGJLA-tocopherol or mPEGJLA-cholesterol (in which tocopherol or cholesterol is bound to ELA via succinic acid diester). The precipitated polymeric product is filtered, and then dried under vacuum to obtain the polymer as white partides.<br>
[110]	In another embodiment, a carboxjlated hydrophobic compound is activated with<br>
oxayl chloride without any catdyst, and bound to the end of mPEG-ILA. That is, tocopherol (or cholesterol) succinate is reacted with oxayl chloride, and then, excessive oxaty chloride is removed under vacuum at room temperature. The mPEG-HLA is weighed and added thereto, and the reaction is performed at 100 °C for 12 hours to obtain mPEG-RA-tocopherol (or cholesterol). The synthesized polymer is dissolved in acetonitrile or methylene chloride, precipitated in hexane/diethji ether, and filtered.<br>
[Ill]	In the above two preparation processes, tocopherol (or cholesterol) malonate,<br>
tocopherol (or cholesterol) glutarate, or tocopherol (or cholesterol) adipate, etc. can be used instead of tocopherol (or cholesterol) succinate.<br>
[112]	In another embodiment, tocopherol or cholesterol is bound to the end of mPEG-<br>
ILA by using a dichloride compound as a linkage agent. Specificaiy, tocopherol or cholesterol is weighed and dehydrated by using a vacuum pump at 50 °G Excessive linkage agent is added thereto, and the reaction is performed for 12 hours. After the reaction is competed, the excessively added linkage agent is removed under vacuum at 100 °C Thereto is added weighed mPEG-HLA, and the reaction is performed at 100<br><br>
°C for 12 hours. The synthesized polymer is dissolved in methylene chloride, and precipitated in hexane/diethyl ether in order to obtain the amphiphilic block copolymer in which tocopherol or cholesterol is bound to ILA via succinic acid diester, i.e. mPEG-ELA-tocopherol or mPEGJLA-cholesterol. The precipitated polymeric product is filtered, and dried under vacuum to obtain the polymer as white partides. The linkage agent which can be used in the reaction may be selected from such dichloride compounds as succinyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, malonyl chloride, glutaryl chloride, adipo chloride, etc.<br>
[113]	The block copolymer synthesized as above may be mixed with a poorly water-<br>
soluUe drug in order to obtain a polymeric micele composition. That is, the dock copolymer (10-200 mg) and the drug (1-50 mg) are dissolved in an organic solvent, e.g. acetonitrile, methylene chloride, etc. The solution is mixed by stirring, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C to prepare a matrix. The matrix of the pooriy water-solutie drug and the polymer is dissolved in distiled water, and then lyophilized to obtain the drug-introduced polymeric micele composition. The above polymeric micele composition may be diluted with an aqueous solution, e.g. physiological sdine, and be used as an injectatie formulation.<br>
[114]	The term "pooriy water-soluble drugs" or "hydrophobic drugs" refers to any drug<br>
or bioactive agent which has the water solubility of 33.3mg/ni or less. This indudes anticancer agents, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, anesthetics, hormones, antihypertensive agents, and agents for the treatment of diabetes, antihyperiipidemic agents, antiviral agents, agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, antidementia agents, antiemetics, immunosuppressants, antiulcerative agents, laxatives, and antimalarial agents.

[115]	The above poody water-soluHe drug may be added to the block copolymer in a<br>
weight-by-weight ratio of 0.1-20.0:80.0-99.9, to be appropriately contained in the inner core of the micele formed from the amphiphilic block copolymer of the present invention.<br>
[116]	In another embodiment, the present invention provides a polymeric composition<br>
comprising an amphiphilic block copolymer of a hydrophilic A block and a hydrophobic B block with a terminal hydroxji group, and a polylactic acid derivative wherein said termind hydroxy termind group of the hydrophobic B block is substituted with a tocopherol or cholesterol group, and at least one end of the polylactic acid derivative is covdenfly bound to at least one carboxyl group.<br>
[117]	The amphiphilic block copolymer comprised of a hydrophilic A block and a hy-<br>

[118]	One or more ends of the polylactic acid derivative of the present invention are<br>
covdenfly bound to at least one carboxyiic acid or carboxylate salt. The non-bound end of the polylactic acid derivative of the present invention may be covdently bound to a functiond group selected from the group consisting of hydroxji, acetoxy, benzoyloxy, decanoyloxy, and pdmitoloxy. The carboxjlic acid or carboxylate sal functions as a hydrophilic group in an aqueous solution of pH 4 or more, and enaHes the polylactic acid derivative to form polymeric miceles therein. When the polylactic acid derivative of the present invention is dissolved in an aqueous solution, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components present in the polylactic acid derivative should be balanced in order to form polymeric miceles. Therefore, the number average molecular weight of the polylactic acid derivative of the present invention is preferaHy within the range of 50 to 50,000 Ddtons .

The metd ion in the akali metd salt forms of the polylactic acid derivative is monovdent, e.g. sodium, potassium, or lithium. The polylactic acid derivative in the metd ion salt form is solid at room temperature, and is very stable because of its relatively neutral pH.<br>

[135]	The initiator for synthesis of the polymers (formula V) includes glycerol,<br>
erythritol, threlol, pentaerytritol, xjiitol, adonitol, sorbitol, and mannitol.<br>
[136]	The polymeric composition of the present invention may contain 0.1 to 99.9 wt%<br>
of the amphiphilic block copolymer and 0.1 to 99.9 wt% of the polylactic acid derivative based on the totd weight of the amphiphilic block copolymer and the polylactic acid derivative. Preferably, the polymeric composition of the present invention contains 20 to 95 wt% of the amphiphilic block copolymer and 5 to 80 wt% of the polylactic acid derivative. More preferaHy, the polymeric composition of the present invention contains 50 to 90 wt% of the amphiphilic block copolymer and 10 to 50 wt% of the polylactic acid derivative.<br>
[137]	The polylactic acid derivatives of the present invention done can form miceles in<br>
an aqueous solution of pH 4 or more, but the polymeric compositions can form miceles in an aqueous solution irrespective of the pH of the solution. Since the biodegradable polymer is usually hydrolyzed at a pH of 10 or more, the polymeric compositions of the present invention may be used at a pH within the range of 1 to 10, preferaHy at a pH within the range of 4 to 8. The partide size of the miceles or nanopartides prepared from the polymeric compositions of the present invention may be adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 400 nm, and preferaHy from 5 to 200 nm, depending on the molecular weight of the polymers and the ratio of the polylactic acid derivative to the amphiphilic block copolymer.<br>
[138]	As ilustrated in Fig.l to Fig.3, the polylactic acid derivatives or the amphiphilic<br>
block copolymers done and mixtures thereof may form miceles in an aqueous solution, and the miceles formed from the polymeric compositions of the amphiphilic block copolymers and the polylactic acid derivatives in an aqueous solution show<br><br>
higher drug entrapping rates and stability than those from the polyiactic acid derivatives or the amphiphilic block copolymers done. In the Figures, 1 represents pooriy water-soluble drugs; 10 represents monomethoxypolyethylenegycol-polylactide hydrophobic moiety (mPEG-ILA- hydrophobic moiety); 11 represents monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG); 12 represents polyiactide hydrophobic moiety (TLA- hydrophobic moiety); 20 represents the sodium salt of D,L-poly(lactic acid); 21 represents D,L-polyiactic acid; and 22 represents sodium carboxjiate. However, the polymeric compositions of the present invention remarkably improve the drug loading efficiency and stability of the miceles formed in an aqueous solution compared with the miceles formed from the polylactic acid derivatives or the amphiphilic block copolymers alone.<br>
[139]	In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a polymeric<br>
composition comprising an amphiphilic dock copolymer comprised of a hydrophilic A block and a hydrophobic B block with a terminal hydroxy! group and a polylactic acid derivative, wherein said termind hydroxyl group is substituted with a hydrophobic tocopherol or cholesterol group, and at least one end of the poljiactic acid derivative is covdenfly bound to at least one carboxyl group, wherein said carboxji group is fixed with a di- or tri-vdent metal ion.<br>
[140]	The metal ion-fixed polymeric composition can be prepared by adding the di- or<br>
tri-vdent metal ion to the polymeric composition of the amphiphilic block copolymer and the po^actic acid derivative. The polymeric miceles or nanopartides may be formed by changing the amount of di- or tri-vdent metal ion added for binding or fixing the carboxyl termind group of the polylactic acid derivative.<br>
[141]	The di- or tri-vdent metal ion is preferaHy one selected from the group consisting<br>
of Ca +, Mg , Ba +, Cr +, Fe , Mn , Ni , Cu +, Zn , and Al . The di- or tri-vdent metal ion may be added to the polymeric composition of the amphiphilic block copolymer and the polylactic acid derivative in the form of sulfate, chloride, carbonate, phosphate or hydroxylate, and preferaHy in the form of CaCl   , MgCl, ZnCl, A1C1, FeCl , CaCO , MgCO, Ca (PO ), Mg (PO ), A1PO , MgSO , Ca(OH), Mg(OH),<br>

[142]	As ilustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, when a monovdent metal ion at the carboxyl<br>
terminus of the poljiactic acid derivative is substituted with a di- or tri-valent metal ion to form a metal ionic bond, the miceles or nanopartides formed therefrom may have improved stability.<br>
[143]	Polymeric miceles or nanopartides can be prepared by changing the equivdents<br><br>
of the metal ion added. Specifically, if a di-vdent metal ion is added at 0.5 equivdents or less with respect to the carboxji termind groups of the polyiactic acid derivative, the metal ion that can form bonds with the carboxji terminal group is insufficient, and thus polymeric miceles are formed. If a di-vdent metal ion is added at 0.5 equivdents or more, the metal ion that can form bonds with the carboxji termind group of the polyiactic acid derivative is sufficient to firmly fix the miceles, and thus nanopartides are formed.<br>
[144]	In addition, the drug release rate from the polymeric miceles or nanopartides may<br>
be adjusted by changing the amount of equivdents of the metal ion added. If the metal ion is present at 1 equivdent or less with respect to the carboxji group of the polyiactic acid derivative, the number available for bonding to the carboxji termind group of the polyiactic acid derivative is decreased, and so the drug release rate is increased. If the metal ion is present at 1 equivdent or more, the number availatte for bonding to the carboxji termind group of the polyiactic acid derivative is increased, and so the drug release rate is decreased. Therefore, to increase the drug release rate in the blood, the metal ion is used in a small equivdent amount, and to decrease the drug release rate, the metal ion is used in a large equivdent amount.<br>
[145]	The metal ion-fixed polymeric compositions of the present invention may contain<br>
5 to 95wt% of the amphiphilic block copolymer, 5 to 95wt% of the polyiactic acid derivative, and 0.01 to 10 equivdents of the di- or tri-vdent metal ion with respect to the number of equivdents of the carboxji termind groups of the polyiactic acid derivatives. Preferably, they contain 20 to 80wt% of the amphiphilic dock copolymer, 20 to 80wt% of the polyiactic acid derivative, and 0.1 to 5 equivdents of the di- or tri-vdent metal ion. More preferably, they contain 20 to 60wt% of the amphiphilic block copolymer, 40 to 80wt% of the polyiactic acid derivative, and 0.2 to 2 equivdents of the di- or tri-vdent metal ion.<br>
[146]	The polymeric composition comprising an amphiphilic block copolymer comprised<br>
of a hydrophilic block and a hydrophobic block in which the hydroxyl termind group is substituted with a hydrophobic tocopherol or cholesterol group having excelent hy-drophobicity, and a polyiactic acid derivative in which the end of the polyiactic acid is covdently bound to at least one carboxji group, and the metal ion-fixed polymeric composition thereof may form stade polymeric miceles or nanopartides in an aqueous environment. Therefore, the present invention dso relates to a pharmaceuticd composition containing polymeric miceles or nanopartides formed from the polymeric compositions of the present invention with a poody water-solude drug<br><br>
entrapped therein. The above composition has a prolonged retention time of effective drug concentration in the Hoodstream after administration. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide increased plasma concentrations of hydrophobic drugs and can be used in various pharmaceutic^ formulations.<br>
[147]	As shown in Figs. 3 to 5, a poody water-solutie drug is mixed with a polymeric<br>
composition of an amphiphilic dock copolymer and a polylactic acid derivative to form polymeric miceles containing the drug therein. A di- or tri-vdent metal ion may be added to form a metal ionic bond with the carboxyl terminal group of the polylactic acid derivative and thereby to form drug-containing polymeric miceles and nanopartides with increased stability.<br>
[148]	The content of the poody water-solutie drug is preferaHy within the range of 0.1<br>
to 30wt% based on the totd weight of the pharmaceutical compositions comprising an amphiphilic block copolymer, a polylactic acid derivative, and a hydrophobic drug. The size of the drug-containing polymeric miceles or nanopartides may be adjusted from 5 to 400 nm, preferaHy, from 10 to 200 nm, depending on the molecular weight of the polymers and the ratio of the amphiphilic block copolymer to the polylactic acid derivative. For an example, the partides of the metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles or nanopartides have an average size of 20-40 nm, as shown in TaHe 7. The miceles of this size range are suitatie for injection formulations and sterile filtration.<br>
[149]	The non-metal ion-treated polymeric composition or metal ion-fixed polymeric<br>
miceles or nanopartides according to the present invention have high stability, and particulaiiy, the metal ion-fixed ones have much higher stability in an aqueous solution. As shown in TaHe 9, the drug containing polymeric micele compositions (Compositions 4 &amp; 5) were kineticdly stable and the metal ion-fixed paditaxel-containing polymeric micele composition were even more kineticdly staHe. The addition of a metal ion can significantly increase the retention time of drug in the polymeric miceles of the present invention. This is due to the crosslinking electrostatic interaction of the carboxylate anion of the polylactic acid derivative which might induce an increase in the rigidity of the hydrophobic core.<br>
[150]	Moreover, the metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles (Composition 4) of the am-<br>
phiphilic diblock copolymers with a hydrophobic moiety (tocopherol succinic acid) substituted for the hydroxyl termind group of the hydrophobic B block had kineticdfy greater stability than the origind mPEG-LA-OH (Composition 7). This result suggests that the increase of hydrophobicity of hydrophobic B block in the amphiphilic polymer results in the formation of more staHe miceles due to stronger interactions<br><br>
between the hydrophobic moiety of the amphiphilic polymer and drug.<br>
[151]	The metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles (Composition 8) of the amphiphilic<br>
diblock copolymers with a hydrophobic moiety (tocopherol succinic acid) substituted for the hydroxyl terminal group of the hydrophobic B block has a much longer Hoodstream retention time than the metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles (Composition 9) of the original amphiphilic diblock copolymer as shown in Table 11 and Fig. 9. This result dso suggests, as demonstrated in Examjie 36, that the increase of hy-drophobicity of the hydrophobic B block in the amphiphilic polymer results in the formation of more staHe miceles due to stronger interactions between the hydrophobic moiety of the amphiphilic polymer and drug.<br>
[152]	As shown in Figs. 10-13, a composition, wherein the drug is entrapped in the metal<br>
ion-fixed polymeric composition has a longer retention time of drug in the bloodstream, and so maintains an effective plasma drug concentration for a longer period of time as compared with the currently marketed formulations.<br>
[153]	The present invention dso provides a pharmaceutical composition for use as an<br>
anticancer agent. In a preferable embodiment, it provides a pharmaceutical composition for use as an anticancer agent, comprising an amphiphilic block copolymer of a hydrophilic A block and a hydrophobic B block with a terminal hydroxy! group, and a poljiactic acid derivative, wherein said termind hydroxji termind group of the hydrophobic B block is substituted with a tocopherol or cholesterol group, and at least one end of the polylectic acid derivative is covdently bound to at least one carboxyl group , and an anticancer drug. T he carboxji terminal group of the polylactic acid derivative can be further fixed with a di- or tri-vdent metal ion.<br>
[154]	Examjies of the anticancer drugs indude, but are not limited to, taxoids, taxines or<br>
taxanes like paditaxel and docetaxel; phodophylotoxins; camptothecins like camptothecin, 9-nitrocamptothecin, 9-aminocamptothecin, camptothecin-11, topodecane; anthracydines like doxorubicin, epirubicin, adarubicin, idarubicin, pyrarubicin; vinca Adoids like vincristine, vinorebine, vindesine, vintripole, vinsdtine; eposilones, platinum, etoposide, methotrexate, carmustine, 5-fluorouracil, retinoic acid, retinol, tamoxifen, mitomycin B, mitomycin C, amonafide, iludin S, etc.<br>
[155]	The polymeric micele-pharmaceuticd composition obtained has greatly improved<br>
pharmaceuticd efficacy. As a specific example, as shown in Figs. 14 to 21, paditaxel<br>
2+<br>
containing Ca -fixed polymeric miceles has a high inhibition rate on cancer growth, and dso inhibits the growth of anticancer drug-resistant cancer Cells (Figs. 22 &amp; 23).<br><br>
7<br>
[156]	Taxol (or paditaxel), doxorubicin, etc. are widely used in chemotherapeutic<br>
treatment of cancer. These anticancer drugs are effective and useful in chemotherapy, but the development of anticancer drug-resistance in cancer Cells dways renders the drugs ineffective. Various mechanisms of Taxol -resistance including the over-expression of P-$ycoprotein (P-gp) and modification of b -tubulin have been characterized- Among them, the overexpression of F-gp has been a predominant mechanism to explain the multi-drug resistant phenomena, including Taxol  -resistance. Anticancer drug-resistant cancer Cells show higher IC    (50% Cell inhibition con-<br>
50<br>
centration of drug) than normal ones, and so chemotherapy with the anticancer drug requires a higher concentration of drug in the tumor Cells. Therefore, specific lo-cdization of the drug in the tumor tissue is required for guaranteeing effectiveness. The metal ion fixed polymeric micele had a longer circulation time than the con-ventiond formulations as shown in Figure 10. Thus, it accumulated more selectively in the tumor tissue by an enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect compared to the conventional formulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of metal ion-fixed<br>
polymeric raiceles against anticancer drug-resistant cancer, an animal model for in<br>
? vivo anti-cancer activity against Taxol -resistant cancer was establiished. When the<br>
cancer Cells which had been inoculated into mice were exposed repeatedly to Taxol , the IC   of the drug for Taxol -pretreated cancer Cells was increased significantly compared to that of the drug for the native cancer Cells. In this animal model, the raetd ion-fixed polymeric micele (Composition 10) treated group showed a higher inhibition rate than the Cremophor EL formulation (Composition 11) treated group, possiUy due to the longer retention time for an effective concentration of the drug incorporated in the metal ion-fixed polymeric micele as shown in Fig. 22 and Table 22. The same effect could be obtained from the doxorubicin-resistant cancer animal model (Fig. 23)<br>
[157]	Therefore, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating<br>
a drug-resistant cancer comprising an amphiphilic dock copolymer of a hydrophilic A block and a hydrophobic B block with a terminal hydroxyl group, and a polylactic acid derivative, wherein said termind hydroxyl terminal group of the hydrophobic B block is substituted with a tocopherol or cholesterol group, and at least one end of the polyiactic acid derivative is covaienlly bound to at least one carboxyl group, and an anticancer drug. The carboxyl terminal group of the polylactic acid derivative of the above composition can be also fixed with a di- or tri-valent metal ion.<br>
[158]	Furthermore, the present invention indudes a process for preparing the above phar-<br><br>
maceuticd composition. Specified , as shown in Figs. 3 and 5, the polylactic acid derivative, the amphiphilic block copolymer, and the poonly water-soluble drug at a certain ratio can be dissolved in one or more solvents selected from the group consisting of acetone, ethanol, methanol, ethji acetate, acetonitrile, meth)iene chloride, chloroform, acetic acid, and dioxane. The organic solvent can be removed therefrom to prepare a homogenous mixture of the pooriy water-soluUe drug and the polymer. The homogenous mixture of the pooriy water-solutie drug and the polymeric composition of the present invention can be added to an aqueous solution of pH 4 to 8, at 0 to 80 °C resulting in a pooriy water-soluble drug-containing mixed polymeric micele aqueous solution. The above drug-containing polymeric micele aqueous solution can then be lyophilized to prepare the polymeric micele composition in a solid form.<br>
[159]	An aqueous solution containing 0.001 to 2 M of the di- or tri-vdent metal ion is<br>
added to the pooriy water-soluUe drug-containing mixed polymeric micele aqueous solution to form metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles. The mixture is slowly stirred at room temperature for 0.1 to 1 hour, and then lyophilized to prepare the metal ion-fixed polymeric micele or nanopartide composition in a solid form.<br>
[160]	Polymeric miceles or nanopartides of the present invention wherein pooriy water-<br>
soluble drug is entrapped and solubilized can be administered ordy or parenteraly. The drug is released from the hydrophobic core of the miceles to exhibit a pharmacologics! effect while the miceles are degraded. Particulariy, the metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles or nanopartides are retained in the bloodstream for a long period of time, and accumulate in the target lesions.<br>
[161]	For parenteral delivery, polymeric miceles or nanopartides may be administered<br>
intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitonedy, transnasdy, intrarectal, in-traoculariy, or intrapubnonarily. For ord delivery, the drug is mixed with the polymeric miceles of the present invention, and then administered in the form of tablet, capsule, or aqueous solution.<br>
[162]	The dose of the polymeric miceles or nanopartides used in the present invention<br>
can be changed over a wide range according to various conditions such as patient's symptoms, age and body weight, and the like.<br>

composition (Composition 4) was kineticdly more stafcle than the Ca    -nontreated<br>
2+<br>
composition (Composition 5). The addition of Ca   significant increased retention of the paditaxel in the polymeric miceles of the present invention. This is due to the<br>
2+<br>
crosslinking electrostatic interaction of D,L-LACOO    and Ca   which might induce<br>
2+<br>
an increase in the rigidity of the hydrophobic core. The Ca   -fixed polymeric miceles (Composition 4) of the amphiphilic ditiock copolymers with a hydrophobic moiety (tocopherol succinic acid) substituted for the hydroxjl termind group of the hydrophobic B block had a much longer retention time than the Ca +-fixed polymeric miceles (Composition 7) of native mPEG-HLA-OH. This result also suggests that the increase of hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic B block in the amphiphilic polymer results in formation of more stable miceles due to stronger interactions between the hydrophobic moiety of the amphiphilic block copolymer and drug.<br>

(Mn: 1,700) were admixed in a weight ratio of 75.0:25.0:1.0, and then the mixture was dissolved in 5 ml of anhydrous ethanol to prepare a dear solution. Ethanol was removed therefrom using a vacuum evaporator to prepare a docetaxel-containing polymeric composition. Distiled water (4 ml) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 60 °C to prepare a polymeric micele aqueous solution containing docetaxel. To the above polymeric micele solution was added a CaCl aqueous solution (concentration: 100 mg/ml) of the same equivalents as the D,LlLACOONa, and the mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was passed through a filter with a pore size of 200 nm, and then was lyophilized. The hydrodynamic partide size of the polymeric miceles was 32 nm.<br>

the volumes of the cancers reached 100-300 mm , the drug was administered, and this point of time was recorded as day 0. At day 0, the mice were divided into 5 groups, and at days 0,1, and 2, at days 0,2, and 4, or at days 0,4, and 8, the metal ion-fixed polymeric miceles (Composition 10) and the Cremophor EL formulation (Composition 11) were administered with various doses of paditaxel through the tail vein, and the volumes of the cancers were measured at different time intervds. The<br>
2<br>
volumes of the cancers were calculated by the formula (W xL)/2 wherein W is a short<br>
axis, and L is a long axis.<br>
[601]	For the evaluation of treatment, tumor volumes were calculated as folows:<br>
[602]	Tumor volumes (TV) = 0.5xLxW2 (L : long axis, W: short axis)<br>

treatment to the control group and at least 4 tumors per group. At the start of the<br>
3<br>
treatment, the minimum tumor diameter was 4 mm or a volume of 30 mm . The animds dying within 2 weeks after the find drug administration were considered as toxic deaths, and were exduded from any evaluation. The treatment groups with more than 1 in 3 toxic deaths or a median body weight loss of more than 15% without compete recovery was considered not evsiuade for antitumor efficacy.<br>
