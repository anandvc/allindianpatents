The present invention is.characterized in that the combustion chamber is composed of an inclined surface and spherical surface, the inclined surtace is provided with two intake valves, the spherical surface is provided with one exhaust valve, a spark plug is located between the intake valves and the exhaust valve.<br>
The included angle between the inclined surface and the center line of the combustion<br>
3<br><br>
chamber is in the range of 54°    to 74°<br>
The distance between the center of the two intake valves is in the range of 12.8 to 32.8mm.<br>
The radius of the spherical surface is in the range of 16 to 36mm.<br>
The volume of the combustion chamber is in the range of 3.4 to 17.4ml.<br>
According to the present invention, the combustion.chamber is provided with two intakes. Therefore/ the gas mixture can be more sufficiently introduced into the cylinder of engine, the amount of the waste gas can be reduced, the charge efficiency of the gas mixture and the liter power can be enhanced, and the driving performance can be improved. According to the present invention, the combustion chamber of incline-sphere shape is employed, and the two intakes and one exhaust hole can be provided within the limited space of the combustion chamber, and it has the advantage of simple fabrication. In addition, the mass of the intake valve can also be reduced, so that the movement inertia can be decreased, the service life of the valve base gaskets and valves can be extended. The present invention is applicable to the engine of motor bicycle with the displacement of less than 125 ml, constituting various types of three-valve engines in motor bicycles. Therefore, the present invention has the advantage of being used widely.<br>

The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a structure view of the present invention. Figure 2 is a horizontal view of the present invention. Figure 3 is a section view along the B-B direction in Figure 2.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3, the present invention provides a three-valve engine combustion chamber. According to the three-valve engine combustion chamber of the present invention, a combustion chamber 1 is formed in a cylinder head 2. A piston ring 4 is sleeved on a piston 3 and mounted on a cylinder body 5. The combustion chamber 1  of incline-sphere shape is composed of an inclined surface 9 and a<br>
3A<br><br>
spherical surface 10. The included angle between the inclined surface 9 and the center line of the combustion chamber 1 is in the range of 54° -74° , the volume of the combustion chamber 1 of incline-sphere shape is in the range of 3.4-17.4ml. The inclined surface 9 is provided with two intake valves 6, the distance between the centers of the two intake valves is in the range of 12.8 - 32.8mm. The spherical surface 10 is provided with one exhaust valve, the radius of the spherical surface 10 is in the range of 16 - 36mm. The spark plug 8 is located between the intake valves 6 and the exhaust valve 7.<br>
The included angle between the tent surface 9 and the center line of the combustion chamber 1 is preferably in the range of 61° -69° . The volume of the combustion chamber of incline-sphere shape is preferably in the range of 8.4 - 12.4 ml. The distance between the centerlines of the two intake valves is preferably in the range of 17.8 ~ 27.8 mm. The radius of the spherical surface 10 is preferably in the range of 21-31 mm. Therefore the arrangement of the intake valves and exhaust valve of the combustion chamber 1 of incline-sphere shape can be relatively reasonable, and the gas mixture can be sufficiently introduced into the cylinder of engine.<br>
The included angle between the tent surface 9 and the center line of the combustion chamber 1 is more preferably in the range of 62° -66° . The volume of the combustion chamber 1 of tent-sphere shape is more preferably in the range of 9.4 ~ 11.4 ml. The distance between the centerlines of the two intake valves is more preferably in the range of 20.8 ~ 24.8 mm. The radius of the spherical surface 10 is more preferably in the range of 24 ~ 38 mm. Therefore, the arrangement of the intake valves and the exhaust valve of the combustion chamber 1 of incline-sphere shape can be more reasonable, and the gas mixture can be more sufficiently introduced into the cylinder of engine.<br>
When the engine starts to work, in the vicinity of the top dead center of the engine exhaust stroke, the cylinder body 5 cause the piston 3 and the piston ring 4 and the two intake valves 6 move to open the combustion chamber 1 with mixed gas entering combustion chamber; and in the vicinity of the bottom dead center of the engine compression stroke, cylinder body 5 carries two intake valves 6 to close combustion chamber. In the vicinity of the bottom dead center of the expansion stroke, the cylinder body 5 cause the piston 3 and the piston ring 4 and an exhaust valve 7 move to open the combustion chamber 1 with the waste gas exhausted out of the combustion chamber 1. In the vicinity of the top dead center of the engine intake stroke, cylinder body 5 carries the exhaust valve 7 to close the exhaust hole. The above process is repeated as such, so that the valve mechanism of the engine can operate continuously.<br>
