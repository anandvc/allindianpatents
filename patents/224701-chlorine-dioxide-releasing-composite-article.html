				<td>CHLORINE DIOXIDE RELEASING COMPOSITE ARTICLE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a device which will produce chlorine dioxide gas<br>
when exposed to an activating stimulus such as ambient humidity or light, and<br>
methods of using the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The prior art discloses a variety of powdered compositions that produce ClO2<br>
gas under a variety of conditions. Included in these are materials for the controlled<br>
sustained release of C1O2 (CSR materials), which release ClO2 when exposed to<br>
water vaDor. Also included are materials disclosed by which produce ClO2 when<br>
exposed to light.<br>
It is desirable for ease of use and disposal for such materials to be contained or<br>
packaged in a manner that contains the powder in a porous pouch (i.e., a sachet) or for<br>
it to be extruded into a polymer matrix film, such as polyethylene. In this manner the<br>
user is protected from direct contact with the powder, and spent powder may be more<br>
readily removed from the area that was treated.<br>
Unfortunately, sachets are relatively bulky and expensive to fabricate, and in<br>
small sizes are very light and difficult to handle. As a result, the cost of packaging<br>
powders in small sachets (less than about 2 grams in size) is often unpractically high.<br>
Extruded polymer sheet material can be relatively less expensive to produce in<br>
small sizes, because the sheet may be produced in a large economical size, and then<br>
smaller size pieces may be inexpensively cut from the larger sheet. However, due to<br>
the low decomposition temperature of the chlorite anion that is incorporated into all<br>
ClO2 producing materials, the extrusion temperature of C102-releasing polymer sheet<br>
must be no higher than about 150-160°C. If the temperature is above that, then the<br>
amount of chlorite that is lost by decomposition during extrusion can be unacceptably<br>
high. This has limited the choice of polymer matrices to those comprising a<br>
substantial amount of relatively low melting, low density polyethylene. But<br>
polyethylene is an undesirable matrix material because it is not highly permeable to<br>
water vapor used to initiate the release of chlorine dioxide from most chlorine<br>
dioxide-releasing materials. Plus the extrusion temperature of polyethylene is about<br>
150 degrees C, so it is right on the borderline where decomposition of chlorite anion<br>
can occur. Since chlorite decomposition can lead to explosive oxidation of the<br>
polyethylene, such extruded sheet materials typically contain lower concentrations of<br>
chlorite anion than many powdered versions. Lower chlorite content, in turn, limits<br>
their maximum yield of ClO2.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Generally, the invention relates to composite articles comprising a material<br>
capable of producing ClO2 upon exposure to an activating stimulus that is integrated<br>
into an organic matrix, and methods of using the article. The organic matrix is<br>
formable at a temperature below about 150°C, preferably below about 135°C, and<br>
most preferably below about 110°C. When the composite article is exposed to an<br>
activating stimulus, such as water or light,/the organic matrix permits at least some<br>
contact between the ClO2-producing material and the activating stimulus, which in<br>
turn causes the material to generate ClO2. The organic matrix is also permeable to<br>
ClO2 so as to allow at least a portion of ClO2 generated by the ClO2-producing<br>
material to escape the composite article. Preferably the article is stable during storage<br>
prior to exposure to the stimulus.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention relates to a composite article comprising a ClO2-producing<br>
material integrated into an organic matrix, and methods of using the same.<br>
The ClO2-producing material is any material or combination of materials that<br>
is capable of generating C1O2 upon exposure to some activating stimulus. The<br>
activating stimulus may be water vapor, electromagnetic energy, or any other trigger<br>
that effects the formation of ClO2 by the CIO2-producing material. Typically, ClO2-<br>
producing materials comprise a chlorite-containing compound, such as sodium<br>
chlorite, and an acidifying agent. Examples of ClO2-producing materials are<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,294,108 and WO 03/056951 A2, both incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The organic matrix contains at least one organic material and: a) is formable<br>
at temperatures below about 150°C, preferably below about 135°C, more preferably<br>
below about 110°C; b) permits at least some contact between an activating stimulus<br>
and the ClO2-producing material when the composite article is exposed to the<br>
activating stimulus so as to enable generation of ClO2; and c) is permeable to ClO2.<br>
The low temperature formability of the organic matrix is compatible with<br>
temperature-sensitive ClO2-producing materials. When exposed to an activating<br>
stimulus, the organic matrix allows the activating stimulus to contact an integrated<br>
ClO2-producing material, and permits the resulting ClO2 to escape into the space<br>
surrounding the article.<br>
One class of materials that may be suitable for the organic matrix is low<br>
melting molecular solids. In particular, low melting hydrophilic molecular solids.<br>
Examples of low melting molecular solid materials are polyethylene glycol wax (such<br>
as that sold under the trade name CARBOWAX by the Dow Chemical Co.), mixtures<br>
of polyethylene glycol wax with paraffin wax, stearic acid, and mixtures of<br>
polyethylene glycol wax with stearic acid. An organic matrix comprising only<br>
paraffin wax as the organic material is preferably used with a humidity-activated<br>
C102-releasing material and with a pore former incorporated into the formulation to<br>
facilitate humidity intrusion.<br>
Another class of materials suitable for the organic matrix are low melting<br>
thermoformable or thermosetting functionalized polymers, such as EVA (ethylene<br>
vinyl acetate). These are commonly used in the formulation of hot melt glue<br>
products that soften and flow (i.e. can be extruded) at relatively low temperatures.<br>
Other hot melt glue type formulations are also satisfactory for this purpose. If ClO2<br>
release is to be initiated by exposure to light, it is preferred that the matrix material be<br>
effectively transparent to the light.<br>
The composite article may be formed by combining the ClO2-releasing<br>
material(s) with the organic matrix material(s), heating to a temperature that is below<br>
150°C to soften or melt the matrix material(s), and extruding the mixture into rods,<br>
sheet, pellets, or the like. Alternatively, the matrix material(s) may be heated to a<br>
temperature below 150°C and softened/melted prior to combination with the ClO2-<br>
producing material.<br>
Alternatively, the composite article may be formed by casting a mixture into a<br>
mold and cooling; by coating a mixture on a flat surface to form a thin sheet (such as<br>
by the doctor blade process); or by passing a mixture through the nip space between<br>
two rollers to form a sheet. Likewise, any of several other methods known to those in<br>
the art may be used to form an article.<br>
The composite article may contain other constituents that provide desired<br>
characteristics. For example, fibrous material may be added to the composite to<br>
increase stiffness and strength, or plasticizers may be added to increase flexibility.<br>
Pore formers, such as silica gel and diatomaceous earth, may be added to increase the<br>
porosity of the article. Increased porosity could facilitate the passage of water vapor<br>
into, and/or ClO2 out of, the article. Coloring and fragrances may be added to<br>
enhance aesthetics. Desiccants may be added to limit water exposure during storage.<br>
The composite article may be used wherever ClO2 would be desired and<br>
exposure to an activating stimulus would occur. Some specific applications include:<br>
food shelf-life extension, microbial deterioration protection of good (e.g., shoes)<br>
during transportation and/or storage, microbial-resistant packaging, deodorizing<br>
devices, and deodorizing coatings.<br>
A non-limiting example of a preferred embodiment will now be described.<br>
Example<br>
Thirteen point three (13.3) grams of chlorine dioxide releasing powder similar<br>
to that described in example 7 of US Patent 6,294,108 was mixed into 20 grams of<br>
melted polyethylene glycol wax (CARBOWAX 4000 brand) at a temperature below<br>
100°C. Five point three (5.3) grams of that mixture was poured into a small<br>
aluminum dish to produce a disk approximately 2 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch<br>
thick. This disk was tested for the release of chlorine dioxide at 80% relative<br>
humidity using the test method described in US Patent 6,294,108, and it produced 5<br>
ppm of ClO2 at about 20 hours.<br>
