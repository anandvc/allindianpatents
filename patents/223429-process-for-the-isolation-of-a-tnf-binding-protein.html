				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF TNF-BINDING PROTEINS USING IMAC<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This Invention relates to the field of polypeptide purification. More specifically, It<br>
relates to the purification of Tumor Necrosis Factor-binding<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA), a potent cytokine, elicits a broad spectrum<br>
of biologic responses which are mediated by binding to a cell surface receptor. The<br>
receptor for human TNF-alpha may bejsqlated from a human jilstiocyjicilymphorna,cell __<br>
Jne (see Stauberet al., J. Blo^Chem., 263, 19098-104, 1988).<br>
Using monoclonal antibodies, another group obtained evidence for 2 distinct<br>
TNF-binding proteins, both of which bind TNF-alpha and TNF-beta specifically and with<br>
high affinity (see Brockhaus et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 87: 7380-7384, 1990) and<br>
isolated the cDNA for one of the receptors. They found that it encodes a protein of 455<br>
amino acids that Is divided into an extracellular domain of 171 residues and a<br>
cytoplasmic domain of 221 residues.<br>
Later on another group (see Aggarwal et al. Nature 318: 665-667, 1985)<br>
showed that tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta initiate their effects on cell function<br>
by binding to common cell surface receptors. The TNF alpha and TNF beta receptors<br>
have different sizes and are expressed differentially in different cell lines (see<br>
Engelmann etal., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 1531-1536, 1990).<br>
TNF alpha Receptor I, referred to by some as TNFR55, is the smaller of .the 2<br>
receptors. cDNAs for both receptors have been cloned and their nucleic acid sequence<br>
determined (see Loetscher et al., Cell 61: 351-359, 1990; Nophar et al., EMBO J. 9:<br>
3269-3278, 1990; Schall et al., Cell 61: 361-370, 1990 and Smith et al., Science 248:<br>
1019-1023, 1990).<br>
Whereas the extracellular domains of the 2 receptors are strikingly similar in<br>
structure, their intracellular domains appear to be unrelated. Southern blotting of<br>
human genomic DNA, using the cDNAs of the 2 receptors as probes, indicated that<br>
each is encoded by a single gene.<br>
Several approaches have been attempted to purify polypeptides.<br>
Chromatography is one of the means most commonly used, including affinity<br>
chromatography in which the substance to be purified is first adsorbed to a bed or<br>
column of a suitable support on which agents having affinity for the given substance<br>
are immobilized to capture it and let the remaining components of the raw mixture pass<br>
unbound. The adsorbed substance is then eluted by changing such environmental<br>
conditions as pH and/or salt concentration to give a partially or totally purified molecule.<br>
In the field of affinity chromatography, the technique known as IMAC<br>
(Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography) has been described as particularly<br>
efficient in certain cases (see the review article by Arnold, Biotechnology, Vol. 9, page<br>
151-156, Feb. 1991). IMAC is described as a powerful technique in the purification of<br>
poiypeptides having functional groups that participate in metal binding, such as the side<br>
chains of Glu, Tyr, Cys, His, Asp and Met, as well as the amino-termlnal amide<br>
nitrogens and backbone carbonyl oxygens.<br>
Although the technique is powerful, it does not always have the required<br>
specificity. For example, it has been ascertained that adsorption on a Cu2* containing<br>
chromatographfc column is excellent for poiypeptides containing one or preferably<br>
more histidines, but it was also observed that even in the absence of the three amino -<br>
acids considered to be most important for adsorption, namely histidine, tryptophan and<br>
cysteine, adsorption of protein may occur, thus impairing the specificity of the<br>
purification step.<br>
The adsorption efficiency, although generally satisfactory for purification<br>
purposes, may not be optimal particularly when the polypeptide to be purified is a<br>
glycoprotein. In this case very often the carbohydrate chains may conceal the sites<br>
active for the binding to the metal cheiate and reduce the affinity for the<br>
chromatographic column in the adsorption step.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that TNF-binding proteins can be efficiently purified by<br>
means of a process including an Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)<br>
step using copper as metal. Optimal conditions of pH and salinity for this step are a pH<br>
of 2.8 to 3.2, preferably pH 3, and a salinity of 14 to 16 rnS, preferably of 15 mS.<br>
According to the present invention TNF-binding proteins" means any protein<br>
which has an affinity for TNF-alpha or TNF-beta and/or a protein which comprises in<br>

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the TNF-binding protein is<br>
selected from recombinant h-TBP-1 (recombinant, extracellular, soluble fragment of<br>
human TNF Receptor-1, comprising the amino acid sequence corresponding to the 20-<br>
180 amino acids fragment of Nophar et al.) and recombinant h-TBP-2 (recombinant,<br>
extracellular, soluble fragment of TNF Receptor-2, comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence corresponding to 23-257 of Smith et al.). Most preferably, it is recombinant<br>
hTBP-1 (r-hTBP-1). For all the other proteins the soluble, extracellular domain is<br>
indicated in the corresponding Swiss-Prot entry.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the purification<br>
process of the TNF-binding protein includes the "IMAC" step as the "capture step" and<br>
further comprise the following steps, as "intermediate steps": ion exchange<br>
chromatography (IEC) at an acidic pH (preferably between 3 and 4) followed by ion<br>
exchange chromatography at a basic pH (preferably between 8 and 10}.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention the purification<br>
process of the TNF-binding protein further comprises, as "polishing step" hydrophobic<br>
interaction chromatography (HIC).<br>
More preferably each of the above mentioned chromatography step is followed<br>
by an ultrafiltration.<br>
"Capture step" according to the present invention means the step during which<br>
the recombinant TNF-binding protein is isolated and concentrated from the crude<br>
harvest supernatant of the recombinant host cells culture containing it. A high yield at<br>
the end of this initial step has a big impact on the overa II performance and yield of the<br>
process. According to the present invention, the capture step carried out on Cu -Chelate<br>
FF and, preferably, with an elutlon at pH 3.0 yields a product having a purity &gt; 40% and<br>
a recovery &gt; 80%.<br>
"Intermediate steps" are the steps during which most of the bulk impurities,<br>
such as other proteins and nucleic acids, endotoxins and viruses are removed.<br>
"Polishing steps" are the steps during which any remining trace impurities or<br>
closely related substances are removed, inorderto obtain a high purity protein.<br>
"Ion exchange chromatography" (IEC) is capable of separating molecules that<br>
have only slight differences in charge to give a very high resolution separation.<br>
Fractions are collected in purified, concentrated form. The separation is based on the<br>
reversible interaction between a charged molecule and an oppositely charged<br>
chromatographic medium. Molecules bind as they are loaded onto the column.<br>
Conditions are then altered so that the bound substances are eluted differentially.<br>
Elution is usually performed by changes in salt concentration or pH. Changes are made<br>
stepwise or with a continuous gradient Q Sepharose or SP Sepharose columns are<br>
commonly used in ion exchange chromatography. "Q Sepharose" is a quaternary<br>
ammonium strong anion exchanger (charged groups: - N *(CH3)3), whereas "SP<br>
Sepharose" is a sulfopropyl strong cation exchanger (charged groups: - SO3")<br>
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is a versatile method for the<br>
purification and separation of biomolecules based on differences in their surface<br>
hydrophobicity. Proteins and peptides usually sequester hydrophobic amino acids in<br>
domains away from the surface of the molecule. However, many biomolecules<br>
considered hydrophilic have sufficient hydrophobic groups exposed to allow interaction<br>
with hydrophobic ligands attached to the chromatographic matrix. Compared to<br>
reversed phase chromatography, the density of the ligand on the matrix is much lower.<br>
This feature promotes the high selectivity of HIC, while allowing m ild elution conditions<br>
to help preserve biological activity. "Butyl Sepharose" column is preferably used<br>
according to the present invention in the hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)<br>
step. On this column the n-butyl group is used as hydrophobic ligand.<br>
According to the present invention, the TNF-binding proteins are produced by<br>
means of recombinant DNA technology in eukaryotic, preferably mammalian, cells. The<br>
recombinant process for producing them is here below reported for completeness.<br>
In the initial step of the process the DNA sequence coding for the desired<br>
protein is inserted and ligated into a suitable plasmid. Once formed, the expression<br>
vector is introduced into a suitable host cell, which then expresses the vector(s) to<br>
yield the desired protein.<br>
Expression of any of the recombinant proteins of the invention as mentioned<br>
herein can be effected in eukaryotic cells (e.g. yeasts, insect or mammalian cells) or<br>
prokaryotic cells, using the appropriate expression vectors. Any method known in the<br>
art can be employed.<br>
For example the DNA molecules coding for the proteins obtained by any of the<br>
above methods are inserted into appropriately constructed expression vectors by<br>
techniques well known in the art (see Sambrook et al, 1989). Double stranded cDNA<br>
is linked to plasmid vectors by homopolymeric tailing or by restriction linking involving<br>
the use of synthetic DNA linkers or blunt-ended ligation techniques: DNA ligases are<br>
used to ligate the DNA molecules and undesirable joining is avoided by treatment<br>
with alkaline phosphatase.<br>
In order to be capable of expressing the desired protein, an expression vector<br>
should comprise also specific nucleotide sequences containing transcriptional and<br>
translational regulatory information linked to the DNA coding the desired protein in<br>
such a way as to permit gene expression and production of the protein. First in order<br>
for the gene to be transcribed, it must be preceded by a promoter recognizable by<br>
RNA polymerase, to which the polymerase binds and thus initiates the transcription<br>
process. There are a variety of such promoters in use, which work with different<br>
efficiencies (strong and weak promoters).<br>
For eukaryotic hosts, different transcriptional and translational regulatory<br>
sequences may be employed, depending on the nature of the host They may be<br>
derived form viral sources, such as adenovirus, bovine papilloma virus, Simian virus or<br>
the like, where the regulatory signals are associated with a particular gene which has a<br>
high level of expression. Examples are the TK promoter of the Herpes virus, the SV40<br>
early promoter, the yeast ga!4 gene promoter, etc. Transcriptional initiation regulatory<br>
signals may be selected which allow for repression and activation, so that expression<br>
of the genes can be modulated.<br>
The ONA molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence coding for the hybrid<br>
protein of the invention is inserted into vector(s), having the operably linked<br>
transcriptional and translations! regulatory signals, which is capable of integrating the<br>
desired gene sequences into the host cell. The cells which have been stably<br>
transformed by the introduced DNA can be selected by also introducing one or more<br>
markers which allow for selection of host cells which contain the expression vector.<br>
The marker may also provide for phototrophy to a auxotropic host, biocide resistance,<br>
e.g. antibiotics, or heavy metals such as copper, or the like. The selectable marker<br>
gene can either be directly linked to the DNA gene sequences to be expressed, or<br>
introduced into the same cell by co-transfection. Additional elements may also be<br>
needed for optimal synthesis of proteins of the invention.<br>
Factors of importance in selecting a particular plasmid or viral vector include:<br>
the ease with which recipient cells, that contain the vector may be recognized and<br>
selected form those recipient cells which do not contain the vector; the number of<br>
copies of the vector which are desired In a particular host; and whether it is desirable<br>
to be able to "shuttle" the vector between host cells of different species.<br>
Once the vector(s) or DNA sequence containing the constructs) has been<br>
prepared for expression the DNA constructs) mat be introduced into an appropriate<br>
host cell by any of a variety of suitable means: transformation, transfection,<br>
conjugation, protoplast fusion, electroporation, calcium phosphate-precipitation, direct<br>
microinjection, etc.<br>
Host ceils may be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Preferred are eukaryotic<br>
hosts, e.g. mammalian cells, such as human, monkey, mouse, and Chinese hamster<br>
ovary (CHO) cells, because they provide post-translational modifications to protein<br>
molecules, including correct folding or glycosylation at correct sites. Also yeast cells<br>
can carry out post-translational peptide modifications including glycosylation. A<br>
number of recombinant DNA strategies exist which utilize strong promoter sequences<br>
and high copy number of plasmids which can be utilized for production of the desired<br>
proteins in yeast. Yeast recognizes leader sequences on cloned mammalian gene<br>
products and secretes peptides bearing leader sequences (i.e., pre-peptides).<br>
After the introduction of the vector(s), the host cells are grown in a selective<br>
medium, which selects for the growth of vector-containing cells. Expression of the<br>
cloned gene sequence(s) results in the production of the desired proteins.<br>
Purification of the recombinant proteins so obtained is carried out according to<br>
the method of the invention.<br>

Column Preparation<br>
8+/-1 ml of Chelating Sepharase Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) is coupled<br>
with iminodiacetic acid resin and packed into the chromatographic column so that the<br>
bed height is 4+1-0.5 cm. The packed column is washed with 10 BV of acidified water<br>
and then loaded with 2 BV of 0.2 M copper sulphate pH 4-4.5. Following the<br>
manufacturer's Instructions a solution 2-3 mM of sodium acetate pH 4-4.5 is used to<br>
facilitate the dissolution of copper sulphate and to avoid precipitation at neutral pH. The<br>
resin is then washed with 10 BV of acidified water.<br>
Procedure<br>
Crude harvest containing r-hTBP-1 (recombinantTNF-binding protein-1), stored<br>
at 4°C, is brought to room temperature; pH is adjusted to 6.8by dropwise addition of<br>
85% ortho-phosphoric acid and conductivity is brought to 21+/-1 mS by addition of solid<br>
NaCI (crude harvest can also be applied after a preliminary concentration phase of<br>
ultrafiltration to remove medium components that could negatively affect the interaction<br>
of r-hTBP-1 with copper).<br>
The column prepared as described above is first equilibrated by flushing with<br>
15-20 BV of equilibration buffer and then loaded with the crude harvest of r-hTBP-1 by<br>
operating at room temperature (22+/-3"C) and at a linear flow rate of 200<br>
ml/sqcm/hour.<br>
The column is first washed with equilibration buffer until the UV signal reaches<br>
the baseline and then is washed with 12-15 BV of water and the column effluent is<br>
discarded.<br>
Elution is carried out with the elution buffer and collection of eluate is started<br>
when a UV signal is detected. The elution of r-hTBP-1 is accomplished with 5-6 BV of<br>
elution buffer. The effluent containing semi-purified r-hTBP-1 is collected and stored at<br>
-20°C.<br>
The column is regenerated with 3 BV of regeneration buffer and the column<br>
effluent is discarded. Thereafter, the column is sanitized wit 5 BV of sanitization<br>
solution.<br>
For storage, the column is washed with 5 BV of storage solution and stored in it.<br>
The purity data after this step are summarized in TABLE 1 below.<br>
Performance of the capture step (comparison with Zn2* IMAC)<br>
The capture step was originally carried out on a Zn2*-chelate IMAC column.<br>
However, the loading capacity of the capture step for crude r-hTBP-1 was considered<br>
too low (250-300 meg r-hTBP-1 or 40 column volumes of crude harvest/ml of resin). By<br>
replacing zinc with copper, as charging metal, a significant increase in the loading<br>
capacity has been obtained. During this Cu2* IMAC capture step, the r-hTBP-1 is<br>
bound to the resin, most of the contaminant proteins are eluted in the unbound fraction<br>
and semipurified r-hTBP-1 is obtained in the elution with a purify level suitable for the<br>
following steps.<br>
By the selected conditions, the required improvement in the binding capacity<br>
has been achieved together with some other advantages. The most relevant results<br>
relative to the present invention are summan'sed below.<br>
The capture step of r-hTBP-1, performed by the metal-chelate chromatography,<br>
shows the following characteristics:<br>
1. Concentration: 25-30 fold concentration of r-hTBP-1, in comparison with the crude<br>
harvest (see Table 1).<br>
2. Purification: The step is effective in the reduction of the contaminants, as shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
3. Scaleabilftv. The method is suitable for scale up and manufacturing scale;<br>
4. Productivity. The recovery of the step is satisfactory as shown in Table 2.<br>
Furthermore the step is very fast, reproducible and easy to be carried out. The<br>
resin can be reused after the appropriate sanitization and recharging.<br>
Furthermore, the main advantages of the use of Cu2*" over Zn^can be<br>
summarised as follows:<br>
• Higher loading capacity: 1ml of Cu-resin binds 1-1.2 mg of r-hTBP-1 against 0.25-<br>
0.5 mg/ml of Zn-resin;<br>
• Improvement of the purity level of material after capture step from 30-35% obtained<br>
by the Zn-resin to 40-50% of Cu-resin as shown in Table 2 (quantitative RP-HPLC).<br>
• Reduction of the number of washes step from 3 of Zn-resin to 1 Cu-resin with a<br>
reduction of working time and buffer consumption.<br>

Column Preparation<br>
The column is packed with SP-Sepharose FF resin, following the<br>
manufacturer's instructions, up to 6-6.5 cm bed height.<br>
The column is sanitized by flushing 3 BV of NaOH 0.5M followed by 3BV of<br>
water.<br>
The column is equilibrated by flushing 4-5 BV of equilibration buffer. pH and<br>
conductivity of column effluent are checked (pH 3.0 ±0.1, conductivity 29.5 ±0.5<br>
mS/cm) and the column is eventually further equilibrated if the measured values are<br>
not within the indicated ranges.<br>
NB: Alternatively, the equilibration buffer can be replaced by 25mM Phosphate<br>
buffer pH 2.8 +/-0.1 without NaCI; the wash buffer can be eliminated; the regeneration<br>
buffer can be replaced by NaCI 1.5M; and the storage solution can be replaced by<br>
10mM NaOH.<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed at a temperature of 2-8°C and at a flow rate of 40-<br>
50 ml/cm/hour.<br>
•VT<br>
Frozen r-hTBP-1 obtained from capture step elution is thawed either at room<br>
temperature or 6 ±2°C. the pH is adjusted from 3.7 ± 0.2 to 3 ±0.1 by adding 85%<br>
phosphoric acid and conductivity is adjusted from 14 ±3 mS/cm to 22±3 mS/cm by<br>
adding solid sodium chloride and the solution is loaded on the column. After loading is<br>
completed, the column is flushed with 3 BV of equilibration buffer, followed by 4 BV of<br>
wash buffer. Alternatively, the washing with the wash buffer can be eliminated (see the<br>
NB above).<br>
Then elution with elution buffer is started. r-hTBP-1 starts to elute after 180-220<br>
ml. This first part is, discarded and the following 3.5 BV which represent semipurified rhTBP-<br>
1 are collected. The eluted fraction is sampled (5 x 0.5 ml) for IPC and stored at<br>
6 ±2eC for not more than 3 days.<br>
After elution is completed, the column is flushed with about 3 BV of<br>
regeneration buffer. The fraction (1x1 ml) is sampled and discarded it.<br>
For storage, the column is flushed with 3 BV of EtOH 20% (or, alternatively with<br>
10mM NaOH) and stored at W-2°C.<br>

STEP 3 - SP ELUATE ULTRAFiLTRATION<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed at room temperature (23 ±3°C).<br>
The ultrafilter stored in NaOH is washed with water until pH 7.0 ±0.5. The<br>
ultrafilter assembled with membrane is loaded with the r-hTBP-1 solution. The solution<br>
is concentrated up to 50 ml. The retentate fraction is diluted with about 200 ml of water<br>
and concentrated again to 50 ml. The washing step described above is repeated three<br>
more times.<br>
The conductivity of the permeate is checked: if it is 
following step.<br>
If the conductivity value is &gt;0.5 mS/cm repeat once more the present washing<br>
step.<br>
200 ml of 50 mM Tris (at pH 9.0+0.1 and conductivity 0.55+0.1 mS/cm) are<br>
added to the retentate fraction and concentrated again up to 50 ml of solution.<br>
The operation described above is repeated three times, and, if needed,<br>
continued until the pH and conductivity of the permeate fraction is 9.0 +0.2 and 0.55<br>
±0.1 mS/cm respectively.<br>
The retentate fraction is collected and the ultrafiter is washed with three 100 ml<br>
aliquots of 50 mM Tris (at pH 9.0 ±0.1 and conductivity 0.6 +0.1 mS/cm) adding the<br>
washing fractions.<br>
The ultrafilter is washed and sanitized with 0.1 M NaOH (or, alternatively, 0.5 M<br>
NaOH) by recycling for not more than 30 minutes. The ultrafilter is rinsed with water<br>
until permeate pH is 7.0±0.5. The ultrafilter is then stored in 0.01 M or, alternatively,<br>
0.05 M NaOH at 23+3°C.<br>
STEP 4 - ION EXCHANGE CHROMATOGRAPHY ON Q-SEPHAROSE FF<br>
Buffers And Solutions<br>
Equilibration buffer: 50mM Tris pH 9.0±0.1, conductivity 0.55+0.1 mS/cm<br>
Elution buffer: 250mM Tris pH 9.0±0.1,50 mM NaCI conductivity 7.2+0.5 mS/cm<br>
Regeneration buffer: 250mM Tris pH 6.010.1,2 M NaCI or, alternatively, 1.5M NaCI<br>
Sanitization solution: 0.5M NaOH.<br>
Storage solution: 20% Ethanol or 10 mM NaOH.<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed in the following conditions:<br>
Temperature: 2-8°C or, alternatively, room temperature; Linear flow rate: 80-90<br>
ml/cm2/hour<br>
The pH of r-hTBP-1 post Ultrafiltration is checked and, if it is different from pH<br>
9.0 ±0.1, it is adjusted with 1M Tris or 3M HCI. The conductivity is also checked.<br>
The column is packed with Q-Sepharose FF resin, following the manufacturer's<br>
instructions, up to 13 cm bed height.<br>
The Q-Sepharose column is then sanitized by flushing 3 BV of NaOH 0.5 M<br>
followed by 6 BV of water. Then the column is flushed with 4 BV of elution buffer and<br>
equilibrated with 7-8 BV of equilibration buffer, pH and conductivity of column effluent is<br>
checked (pH 9.0 +0.2, conductivity 0.55 ±0.1 mS/cm). The equilibration of the column<br>
is eventually continuously performed if the measured values are not within the<br>
indicated ranges.<br>
The column is then loaded with ultrafiltered r-hTBP-1 prepared as above. After<br>
loading is completed, the column is flushed with 3 BV of equilibration buffer.<br>
Elution is started with the elution buffer. Pure h-hTBP-1 starts to elute after<br>
1BV; collection of r-hTBP-1 is started after the first BV according to the<br>
chromatographic profile; then elution is completed after 5-6 BV.<br>
The column is flushed with 3 BV of regeneration buffer, sample (1 x 1ml) and<br>
then discarded. The column is again flushed with 3 BV of 0.5 M NaOH, rinsed with<br>
water until the pH of the effluent is between 7 and 8. Finally the column is flushed with<br>
3 BV of EtOH 20 % and stored at 2 -8°C.<br>
30-<br>
STEP 5 - NANOFILTRATION ON DV 50 PALL<br>
The stainless steel support is installed in the disc-holder and the DV50 filter (47<br>
mm diameter) is placed on the support. Pall Ultipor® VF Grade DV50 is a filter cartridge<br>
which is normally used for viruses removal. A few drops of water are added on the top<br>
of the disk. The appropriate seals are installed and the disc-holder is closed tightly. The<br>
system is filled with 50 ml of Q elution buffer, closed and connected to the Nitrogen<br>
source.<br>
At the beginning of the flushing the nitrogen is opened at an initial pressure of<br>
0.5 bar and then the vent valve located on the disc-holder is opened in order to purge<br>
the system.<br>
As soon as the first drop of liquid appears at the vent valve on the disc -holder, it<br>
is closed tightly and the nitrogen is opened to the right pressure, 3.0-3.5 bar.<br>
The membrane is then flushed with all the 50 ml of buffer, in order to assure<br>
that the membrane iswet and to eliminate air, if present, between the sheets of the<br>
membrane and perform the integrity test on the filter.<br>
The system is filled with material coming from the previous step and operated<br>
as follows: at the beginning of the filtration the nitrogen is opened at an initial pressure<br>
of 0.5 bar and then the vent valve located on the disc-holder is openend in order to<br>
purge the system .As soon as the first drop of solution starts to appears, the vent valve<br>
of the disc-holder is closed and the nitrogen opened to a pressure of 1.5-2.5 bar.<br>
The nitrogen pressure is kept at 1.5-2.5 bar and then the solution is filtered.<br>
The filtered solution is collected in a container and at the end of the filtration,<br>
the nitrogen source is closed and the vent valve is opened to eliminate excess of<br>
nitrogen.<br>
At the end of the filtration, the system is washed with 5-10 ml of the elution<br>
buffer of the previous step, at the same working pressure of 1.5-2.5 bar.<br>
The washing solution is collected in the same container of the filtered solution<br>
and sampled for IPC.<br>
STEP 6 - HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION ON BUTYL SEPHAROSE FF<br>
Buffers And Solutions<br>
Equilibration buffer: 200 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5+0.1, 1 M Na2SO4 conductivity 90±5<br>
mS/cm<br>
Button buffer: 200 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5+0.1,0.7 M Na2SO4, conductivity 75±5 mS/cm<br>
Regeneration solution:Purified water<br>
Sanitization solution: 1M NaOH<br>
Storage solution :20% ethanol or 10 mM NaOH<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed at a temperature of 23 ±3°C and at a linear flow<br>
rate of 80-90 ml/cm/hour. Solid Na?SO4 is added to Q-Sepharose eluate, post 100 KD<br>
Ultrafiltration under stirring, up to 1M. After that the dissolution of the salt is completed,<br>
the pH is adjusted to 7.5 ±0.1 with 3M HCI. The column is then flushed with 3 BV of<br>
NaOH 1M followed by 4BV of purified water.<br>
The column is again flushed with 5-6 BV of equilibration buffer. The pH and<br>
conductivity of effluent (pH 7.510.2, conductivity 90 ±5 mS/cm) are checked and the<br>
column equilibration is continuously performed, if measured values are out of indicated<br>
ranges.<br>
The solution prepared as above is loaded on to the column and, after loading is<br>
completed, the column is washed with 3 BV of equilibration buffer. Wash with<br>
equilibration buffer is continued.<br>
After 2-3 BV of wash, proteins start to elute. This fraction contains r-hTBP-1,<br>
10-12% about of total, contaminated by cell culture contaminants. This wash is<br>
prolonged until protein elution reaches the plateau giving a broad peak (about 2 BV).<br>
Then elution is started with elution buffer. The first 1 -2 BV are pooled with the<br>
washing sample, since it contains a small amount of contaminants and immediately<br>
thereafter collection of r-hTBP-1 is started.<br>
Purified r-hTBP-1 elutes immediately after the contaminated material and<br>
elution is continued for another 2.5-3 BV. The collection is stopped when the UV<br>
absorbance reaches the 0.5 % of max. After collection of r-hTBP-1, the fraction<br>
(5x0.5ml) is sampled and stored it at 2-8°C for not more than 3 days.<br>
The column is flushed with 3 BV of purified water and the fraction collected.<br>
The column is sanitized with 3 BV of 1 M NaOH and rinsed with water until the<br>
pH of effluent is between 7 and 8.<br>
Then the column is flushed again with three column volume of ethanol 20 %<br>
and stored at room temperature for not more than 2 weeks.<br>
STEP 7 -10 KD ULTRAFILTRATION<br>
The stirred cell type 8400, assembled with the membrane, is loaded with the<br>
Butyl-Sepharose eluate. The solution is concentrated to about 25 ml, under nitrogen<br>
pressure of 3 bars. The retentate fraction is diluted with about 100 ml of water and<br>
concentrated again to 25 ml. The washing step described above is repeated three<br>
further times. The conductivity of the permeate is checked: if it is 
following step can be started. If the conductivity value is &gt;0.3 mS/cm, the washing step<br>
should be repeated.<br>
100 ml of bulk buffer is added to the retentate fraction and concentrated again<br>
up to 25 ml of solution. This operation is repeated three times, and, if needed, until the<br>
pH and conductivity of the permeate fraction is 7.1 ±0.2 and 5.8 ±0.2 mS/cm,<br>
respectively.<br>
The retentate fraction is discarded and loaded on the smaller ultrafiltration<br>
stirred cell type 8050, assembled with the membrane. The retentate is concentrated to<br>
minimum volume (about 3-5 ml). The retentate fraction is collected and the ultrafilter<br>
with bulk is washed by adding the washing fractions to the concentrated r-hTBP-1. The<br>
final volume is adjusted in order to obtain a final concentration of about 20 -30 mg/ml by<br>
OD 280 nm(e= 0.71).<br>
The ultrafilters are washed and sanitized with 0.2 M NaOH by recycling for at<br>
least 30 minutes. The ultrafilters are then rinsed with water unti I the permeate pH is 7.0<br>
±0.5. The ultrafilters are then stored in NaOH 0.01 M at 6 ±2°C.<br>
STEP 8 - MICROFILTRATION<br>
A disposable syringe is connected to a 0.22 \i filter, filled with the r-hTBP-1<br>
concentrated solution, filtered and washed twice with 1 ml of bulk buffer by pooling the<br>
washes with the filtered bulk. The resulting solution is sampled for analytical tests (15<br>
x 0.2 ml) and stored at -20°C.<br>
Results are satisfactory under the quantitation and purity points of view as<br>
shown by the following tables (Tables 4 to 6) reflecting the results of an adequate<br>
number of replications of this process (RUN).<br>
Most critical to the process of this invention is the initial chromatography step on<br>
Cu*2 chelate column. Moreover, it is also important the combination of the SP<br>
Sepharose chromatography at an acid pH with a following Q Sepharose at a basic pH.<br>
In these conditions, strikingly good results have been obtained by subjecting a crude<br>
harvest from CHO production of r-hTBP-1 (Onercept). The capture step in particular<br>
has been shown to be able to 25-30 fold concentrate r-hTBP-1, to effectively reduce<br>
contaminants, to have a satisfactory recovery of the protein and to be scaleable for<br>
industrial manufacturing.<br>
Even more surprising is the fact that outstanding purity data are obtained both<br>
when the starting material is a crude supernatant from serum-containing cell culture<br>
and when it comes from serum-free cultures, as will be shown below.<br>

good resolution between r-hTBP-1 and cell culture contaminants is obtained. The rhTBP-<br>
1 can be resolved in one or two peaks depending on the column batch. The<br>
procedure is described here below.<br>

1.2 Calculation<br>
The amount of r-hTBP-1 in each purification sample has been obtained as<br>
follows:<br>
• calculate the response factor (RF) for the standard (BTC10) according to the<br>
formula:<br>
„, TBPlmcg/ml<br>
Kf =<br>
TBP1 peak area<br>
Multiply the r-hTBP-1 peak area of each sample by the RF of the standard<br>
obtaining the concentration of the sample in meg/ml as shown:<br>
TBP1 meg / ml = TBP1 peak area x RF standard<br>
Please note that:<br>
• The BTC10 used as standard has been chosen on the basis of availability;<br>
• The retention time of r-hTBP-1 peak can shift at each new buffer preparation (1 -3<br>
min);<br>
• Concentrated sample has to be diluted in eluant A.<br>
2, Fluorimetric RP-HPLC -Working procedure<br>
Based on previous experiences with other recombinant proteins a RP-HPLC<br>
analysis with a fluorimetric detection has been set up to estimate the purity level of the<br>
residual cell culture contaminants both in r-hTBP-1 bulks and in in process samples<br>
since no immunochemical method was available when the purification study started.<br>
This method was found useful to monitor the removal of cell culture<br>
contaminants in the last purification step, i.e. Butyl Sepharose chromatography and it<br>
was determinant in the selection of the operative conditions of the above step, since it<br>
could be used to analyze the in-process samples and no special materials and/or<br>
apparatus are required. The RP-HPLC is fast (run time 62 minutes) and gives results<br>
comparable to the immunoassay when this test became available. Since a standard for<br>
contaminants was not yet. available, a BSA solution from Pierce was used as standard<br>
to estimate the contamination level in the samples. As the quantitative RP -HPLC, this<br>
test gives a good resolution between r-hTBP-1 and BSA area.<br>

Multiply the contaminants peaks area of each sample by the RF of the standard<br>
and by 1000 obtaining the amount of contaminants in the sample injected in ng.<br>
Dividing this value by the amount of r-hTBP-1 injected the contamination in parts per<br>
million is obtained, according to the formula:<br>
. . ^_ contaminants peak areas xRFBSA x 1000<br>
ppm contaminants =<br>
TBPlmg injected<br>
Please note that:<br>
• Test sample has to be diluted in eluant A.<br>
• The contamination of the control sample ranges between 190 and 240 ppm.<br>
3. Analysis and characterization of the r-hTPB-1 Bulk<br>
The analytical methods described hereinafter have been set up and used to<br>
characterize the r-hTBP-1 bulk originated by the new purification procedure.<br>
3.1 SE-HPLC<br>
This method was developed with the aim to quantitate the amount of dimers<br>
and aggregates in the final bulk. The method can discriminate between r-hTBP-1<br>
monomer and its dimer and/or aggregates. This has been proved by testing some r -<br>
hTBP-1 samples after UV treatment, a method widely known to generate aggregate<br>
forms of molecules. Briefly the method is carried out as follows:<br>
3.1.1 Equipment. materials and method<br>
Equipment: Analytical HPLC System<br>
Column: TSK G2000 SWxt cod. 08021 (TosoHaas)<br>
Mobile phase: 0.1M Sodium phosphate pH 6.7,0.1M sodium sulfate<br>
Temperature: 23±3°C<br>
UV detection: 214 nm<br>
Injection volume: 10-100 nl corresponding to 20-30 meg of r-hTBP-1 (by OD)<br>
Injection time: 30 minutes<br>
Standard: BTC10,1.53 mg/ml by OD 280 nm (e= 0.71) 10-20 |j.l injected<br>
r-hTBP-1 bulk: diluted to 1-2 mg/ml by OD 280 nm (e= 0.71) 10-20 |il injected<br>
The purity of the sample is expressed as % of purity of r-hTBP-1 peak / total area ratio.<br>
3.2 IE-HPLC<br>
This method was developed to evaluate the isoform composition in the final<br>
bulk with the aim to replace the chromatofocussing technique generally used for the<br>
above purpose. In contrast to the chromatofocussing, the (EC analysis is more<br>
advantageous because is faster than the above, requires less material (150-200 meg<br>
instead of 1 -2-mg), employes common buffers and does not require pretreatment of the<br>
test sample. Since r-hTBP-1 is a glycoprotein, as a substance of that nature, it is<br>
characterized by different isoforms having each one a different isoelectric point that<br>
determines a different behaviour when tested by an ion exchange analysis. 12 different<br>
peaks, each one corresponding to a glycosilation variant, are obtained. By the present<br>
method all the isoforms of the r-hTBP-1 have been isolated and fully characterized.<br>
Briefly the method is carried out as follows:<br>

4. Quantitation of r-hTBP-1 by OD<br>
The concentration of the r-hTBP-1 bulks produced in accordance with the<br>
present invention was determined by optical density at 280 nm using the molar<br>
extinction coefficient (e) calculated in house on r-hTBP-1 bulk produced during the<br>
initial phase of the purification of r-hTBP-1. Three representative r-hTBP1 bulks<br>
produced with the new purification process have been used, obtaining e=0.776. This<br>
new extinction coefficient will be used for the scale up and production phases. Since<br>
the concentration of the bulks is in the range of 20-30 mg/ml, it is necessary dilute the<br>
material to 1 mg/ml with bulk buffer (40 mM PBS pH 7.1 ±0.2, 10 mM NaCI), prior to<br>
test the absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
5. Protein determination by Bradford<br>
The Bradford method was used to quantitate total proteins in the r-hTBP-1 bulk<br>
(see Bradford, MM. Analytical Biochemistry 72:248-254, 1976 and Stoscheck, CM..<br>
Methods in Enzymology 182:50-69,1990). The standard used in this test is BSA.<br>
6. In vitro Bioassay<br>
The bioactivity of r-hTBP-1 consists in its capacity to bind TNFa. This test was used to<br>
assay both the in process samples and bulks.<br><br><br><br>
PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF TNF-BINDING PROTEINS USING IMAC<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This Invention relates to the field of polypeptide purification. More specifically, It<br>
relates to the purification of Tumor Necrosis Factor-binding<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA), a potent cytokine, elicits a broad spectrum<br>
of biologic responses which are mediated by binding to a cell surface receptor. The<br>
receptor for human TNF-alpha may bejsqlated from a human jilstiocyjicilymphorna,cell __<br>
Jne (see Stauberet al., J. Blo^Chem., 263, 19098-104, 1988).<br>
Using monoclonal antibodies, another group obtained evidence for 2 distinct<br>
TNF-binding proteins, both of which bind TNF-alpha and TNF-beta specifically and with<br>
high affinity (see Brockhaus et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 87: 7380-7384, 1990) and<br>
isolated the cDNA for one of the receptors. They found that it encodes a protein of 455<br>
amino acids that Is divided into an extracellular domain of 171 residues and a<br>
cytoplasmic domain of 221 residues.<br>
Later on another group (see Aggarwal et al. Nature 318: 665-667, 1985)<br>
showed that tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta initiate their effects on cell function<br>
by binding to common cell surface receptors. The TNF alpha and TNF beta receptors<br>
have different sizes and are expressed differentially in different cell lines (see<br>
Engelmann etal., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 1531-1536, 1990).<br>
TNF alpha Receptor I, referred to by some as TNFR55, is the smaller of .the 2<br>
receptors. cDNAs for both receptors have been cloned and their nucleic acid sequence<br>
determined (see Loetscher et al., Cell 61: 351-359, 1990; Nophar et al., EMBO J. 9:<br>
3269-3278, 1990; Schall et al., Cell 61: 361-370, 1990 and Smith et al., Science 248:<br>
1019-1023, 1990).<br>
Whereas the extracellular domains of the 2 receptors are strikingly similar in<br>
structure, their intracellular domains appear to be unrelated. Southern blotting of<br>
human genomic DNA, using the cDNAs of the 2 receptors as probes, indicated that<br>
each is encoded by a single gene.<br>
Several approaches have been attempted to purify polypeptides.<br>
Chromatography is one of the means most commonly used, including affinity<br>
chromatography in which the substance to be purified is first adsorbed to a bed or<br>
column of a suitable support on which agents having affinity for the given substance<br>
are immobilized to capture it and let the remaining components of the raw mixture pass<br>
unbound. The adsorbed substance is then eluted by changing such environmental<br>
conditions as pH and/or salt concentration to give a partially or totally purified molecule.<br>
In the field of affinity chromatography, the technique known as IMAC<br>
(Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography) has been described as particularly<br>
efficient in certain cases (see the review article by Arnold, Biotechnology, Vol. 9, page<br>
151-156, Feb. 1991). IMAC is described as a powerful technique in the purification of<br>
poiypeptides having functional groups that participate in metal binding, such as the side<br>
chains of Glu, Tyr, Cys, His, Asp and Met, as well as the amino-termlnal amide<br>
nitrogens and backbone carbonyl oxygens.<br>
Although the technique is powerful, it does not always have the required<br>
specificity. For example, it has been ascertained that adsorption on a Cu2* containing<br>
chromatographfc column is excellent for poiypeptides containing one or preferably<br>
more histidines, but it was also observed that even in the absence of the three amino -<br>
acids considered to be most important for adsorption, namely histidine, tryptophan and<br>
cysteine, adsorption of protein may occur, thus impairing the specificity of the<br>
purification step.<br>
The adsorption efficiency, although generally satisfactory for purification<br>
purposes, may not be optimal particularly when the polypeptide to be purified is a<br>
glycoprotein. In this case very often the carbohydrate chains may conceal the sites<br>
active for the binding to the metal cheiate and reduce the affinity for the<br>
chromatographic column in the adsorption step.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that TNF-binding proteins can be efficiently purified by<br>
means of a process including an Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)<br>
step using copper as metal. Optimal conditions of pH and salinity for this step are a pH<br>
of 2.8 to 3.2, preferably pH 3, and a salinity of 14 to 16 rnS, preferably of 15 mS.<br>
According to the present invention TNF-binding proteins" means any protein<br>
which has an affinity for TNF-alpha or TNF-beta and/or a protein which comprises in<br>
the extra-cellular, soluble fragment of a protein belonging to the TNF receptors family,<br>

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the TNF-binding protein is<br>
selected from recombinant h-TBP-1 (recombinant, extracellular, soluble fragment of<br>
human TNF Receptor-1, comprising the amino acid sequence corresponding to the 20-<br>
180 amino acids fragment of Nophar et al.) and recombinant h-TBP-2 (recombinant,<br>
extracellular, soluble fragment of TNF Receptor-2, comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence corresponding to 23-257 of Smith et al.). Most preferably, it is recombinant<br>
hTBP-1 (r-hTBP-1). For all the other proteins the soluble, extracellular domain is<br>
indicated in the corresponding Swiss-Prot entry.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the purification<br>
process of the TNF-binding protein includes the "IMAC" step as the "capture step" and<br>
further comprise the following steps, as "intermediate steps": ion exchange<br>
chromatography (IEC) at an acidic pH (preferably between 3 and 4) followed by ion<br>
exchange chromatography at a basic pH (preferably between 8 and 10}.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention the purification<br>
process of the TNF-binding protein further comprises, as "polishing step" hydrophobic<br>
interaction chromatography (HIC).<br>
More preferably each of the above mentioned chromatography step is followed<br>
by an ultrafiltration.<br>
"Capture step" according to the present invention means the step during which<br>
the recombinant TNF-binding protein is isolated and concentrated from the crude<br>
harvest supernatant of the recombinant host cells culture containing it. A high yield at<br>
the end of this initial step has a big impact on the overa II performance and yield of the<br>
process. According to the present invention, the capture step carried out on Cu -Chelate<br>
FF and, preferably, with an elutlon at pH 3.0 yields a product having a purity &gt; 40% and<br>
a recovery &gt; 80%.<br>
"Intermediate steps" are the steps during which most of the bulk impurities,<br>
such as other proteins and nucleic acids, endotoxins and viruses are removed.<br>
"Polishing steps" are the steps during which any remining trace impurities or<br>
closely related substances are removed, inorderto obtain a high purity protein.<br>
"Ion exchange chromatography" (IEC) is capable of separating molecules that<br>
have only slight differences in charge to give a very high resolution separation.<br>
Fractions are collected in purified, concentrated form. The separation is based on the<br>
reversible interaction between a charged molecule and an oppositely charged<br>
chromatographic medium. Molecules bind as they are loaded onto the column.<br>
Conditions are then altered so that the bound substances are eluted differentially.<br>
Elution is usually performed by changes in salt concentration or pH. Changes are made<br>
stepwise or with a continuous gradient Q Sepharose or SP Sepharose columns are<br>
commonly used in ion exchange chromatography. "Q Sepharose" is a quaternary<br>
ammonium strong anion exchanger (charged groups: - N *(CH3)3), whereas "SP<br>
Sepharose" is a sulfopropyl strong cation exchanger (charged groups: - SO3")<br>
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is a versatile method for the<br>
purification and separation of biomolecules based on differences in their surface<br>
hydrophobicity. Proteins and peptides usually sequester hydrophobic amino acids in<br>
domains away from the surface of the molecule. However, many biomolecules<br>
considered hydrophilic have sufficient hydrophobic groups exposed to allow interaction<br>
with hydrophobic ligands attached to the chromatographic matrix. Compared to<br>
reversed phase chromatography, the density of the ligand on the matrix is much lower.<br>
This feature promotes the high selectivity of HIC, while allowing m ild elution conditions<br>
to help preserve biological activity. "Butyl Sepharose" column is preferably used<br>
according to the present invention in the hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)<br>
step. On this column the n-butyl group is used as hydrophobic ligand.<br>
According to the present invention, the TNF-binding proteins are produced by<br>
means of recombinant DNA technology in eukaryotic, preferably mammalian, cells. The<br>
recombinant process for producing them is here below reported for completeness.<br>
In the initial step of the process the DNA sequence coding for the desired<br>
protein is inserted and ligated into a suitable plasmid. Once formed, the expression<br>
vector is introduced into a suitable host cell, which then expresses the vector(s) to<br>
yield the desired protein.<br>
Expression of any of the recombinant proteins of the invention as mentioned<br>
herein can be effected in eukaryotic cells (e.g. yeasts, insect or mammalian cells) or<br>
prokaryotic cells, using the appropriate expression vectors. Any method known in the<br>
art can be employed.<br>
For example the DNA molecules coding for the proteins obtained by any of the<br>
above methods are inserted into appropriately constructed expression vectors by<br>
techniques well known in the art (see Sambrook et al, 1989). Double stranded cDNA<br>
is linked to plasmid vectors by homopolymeric tailing or by restriction linking involving<br>
the use of synthetic DNA linkers or blunt-ended ligation techniques: DNA ligases are<br>
used to ligate the DNA molecules and undesirable joining is avoided by treatment<br>
with alkaline phosphatase.<br>
In order to be capable of expressing the desired protein, an expression vector<br>
should comprise also specific nucleotide sequences containing transcriptional and<br>
translational regulatory information linked to the DNA coding the desired protein in<br>
such a way as to permit gene expression and production of the protein. First in order<br>
for the gene to be transcribed, it must be preceded by a promoter recognizable by<br>
RNA polymerase, to which the polymerase binds and thus initiates the transcription<br>
process. There are a variety of such promoters in use, which work with different<br>
efficiencies (strong and weak promoters).<br>
For eukaryotic hosts, different transcriptional and translational regulatory<br>
sequences may be employed, depending on the nature of the host They may be<br>
derived form viral sources, such as adenovirus, bovine papilloma virus, Simian virus or<br>
the like, where the regulatory signals are associated with a particular gene which has a<br>
high level of expression. Examples are the TK promoter of the Herpes virus, the SV40<br>
early promoter, the yeast ga!4 gene promoter, etc. Transcriptional initiation regulatory<br>
signals may be selected which allow for repression and activation, so that expression<br>
of the genes can be modulated.<br>
The ONA molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence coding for the hybrid<br>
protein of the invention is inserted into vector(s), having the operably linked<br>
transcriptional and translations! regulatory signals, which is capable of integrating the<br>
desired gene sequences into the host cell. The cells which have been stably<br>
transformed by the introduced DNA can be selected by also introducing one or more<br>
markers which allow for selection of host cells which contain the expression vector.<br>
The marker may also provide for phototrophy to a auxotropic host, biocide resistance,<br>
e.g. antibiotics, or heavy metals such as copper, or the like. The selectable marker<br>
gene can either be directly linked to the DNA gene sequences to be expressed, or<br>
introduced into the same cell by co-transfection. Additional elements may also be<br>
needed for optimal synthesis of proteins of the invention.<br>
Factors of importance in selecting a particular plasmid or viral vector include:<br>
the ease with which recipient cells, that contain the vector may be recognized and<br>
selected form those recipient cells which do not contain the vector; the number of<br>
copies of the vector which are desired In a particular host; and whether it is desirable<br>
to be able to "shuttle" the vector between host cells of different species.<br>
Once the vector(s) or DNA sequence containing the constructs) has been<br>
prepared for expression the DNA constructs) mat be introduced into an appropriate<br>
host cell by any of a variety of suitable means: transformation, transfection,<br>
conjugation, protoplast fusion, electroporation, calcium phosphate-precipitation, direct<br>
microinjection, etc.<br>
Host ceils may be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Preferred are eukaryotic<br>
hosts, e.g. mammalian cells, such as human, monkey, mouse, and Chinese hamster<br>
ovary (CHO) cells, because they provide post-translational modifications to protein<br>
molecules, including correct folding or glycosylation at correct sites. Also yeast cells<br>
can carry out post-translational peptide modifications including glycosylation. A<br>
number of recombinant DNA strategies exist which utilize strong promoter sequences<br>
and high copy number of plasmids which can be utilized for production of the desired<br>
proteins in yeast. Yeast recognizes leader sequences on cloned mammalian gene<br>
products and secretes peptides bearing leader sequences (i.e., pre-peptides).<br>
After the introduction of the vector(s), the host cells are grown in a selective<br>
medium, which selects for the growth of vector-containing cells. Expression of the<br>
cloned gene sequence(s) results in the production of the desired proteins.<br>
Purification of the recombinant proteins so obtained is carried out according to<br>
the method of the invention.<br>

Column Preparation<br>
8+/-1 ml of Chelating Sepharase Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) is coupled<br>
with iminodiacetic acid resin and packed into the chromatographic column so that the<br>
bed height is 4+1-0.5 cm. The packed column is washed with 10 BV of acidified water<br>
and then loaded with 2 BV of 0.2 M copper sulphate pH 4-4.5. Following the<br>
manufacturer's Instructions a solution 2-3 mM of sodium acetate pH 4-4.5 is used to<br>
facilitate the dissolution of copper sulphate and to avoid precipitation at neutral pH. The<br>
resin is then washed with 10 BV of acidified water.<br>
Procedure<br>
Crude harvest containing r-hTBP-1 (recombinantTNF-binding protein-1), stored<br>
at 4°C, is brought to room temperature; pH is adjusted to 6.8by dropwise addition of<br>
85% ortho-phosphoric acid and conductivity is brought to 21+/-1 mS by addition of solid<br>
NaCI (crude harvest can also be applied after a preliminary concentration phase of<br>
ultrafiltration to remove medium components that could negatively affect the interaction<br>
of r-hTBP-1 with copper).<br>
The column prepared as described above is first equilibrated by flushing with<br>
15-20 BV of equilibration buffer and then loaded with the crude harvest of r-hTBP-1 by<br>
operating at room temperature (22+/-3"C) and at a linear flow rate of 200<br>
ml/sqcm/hour.<br>
The column is first washed with equilibration buffer until the UV signal reaches<br>
the baseline and then is washed with 12-15 BV of water and the column effluent is<br>
discarded.<br>
Elution is carried out with the elution buffer and collection of eluate is started<br>
when a UV signal is detected. The elution of r-hTBP-1 is accomplished with 5-6 BV of<br>
elution buffer. The effluent containing semi-purified r-hTBP-1 is collected and stored at<br>
-20°C.<br>
The column is regenerated with 3 BV of regeneration buffer and the column<br>
effluent is discarded. Thereafter, the column is sanitized wit 5 BV of sanitization<br>
solution.<br>
For storage, the column is washed with 5 BV of storage solution and stored in it.<br>
The purity data after this step are summarized in TABLE 1 below.<br>
Performance of the capture step (comparison with Zn2* IMAC)<br>
The capture step was originally carried out on a Zn2*-chelate IMAC column.<br>
However, the loading capacity of the capture step for crude r-hTBP-1 was considered<br>
too low (250-300 meg r-hTBP-1 or 40 column volumes of crude harvest/ml of resin). By<br>
replacing zinc with copper, as charging metal, a significant increase in the loading<br>
capacity has been obtained. During this Cu2* IMAC capture step, the r-hTBP-1 is<br>
bound to the resin, most of the contaminant proteins are eluted in the unbound fraction<br>
and semipurified r-hTBP-1 is obtained in the elution with a purify level suitable for the<br>
following steps.<br>
By the selected conditions, the required improvement in the binding capacity<br>
has been achieved together with some other advantages. The most relevant results<br>
relative to the present invention are summan'sed below.<br>
The capture step of r-hTBP-1, performed by the metal-chelate chromatography,<br>
shows the following characteristics:<br>
1. Concentration: 25-30 fold concentration of r-hTBP-1, in comparison with the crude<br>
harvest (see Table 1).<br>
2. Purification: The step is effective in the reduction of the contaminants, as shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
3. Scaleabilftv. The method is suitable for scale up and manufacturing scale;<br>
4. Productivity. The recovery of the step is satisfactory as shown in Table 2.<br>
Furthermore the step is very fast, reproducible and easy to be carried out. The<br>
resin can be reused after the appropriate sanitization and recharging.<br>
Furthermore, the main advantages of the use of Cu2*" over Zn^can be<br>
summarised as follows:<br>
• Higher loading capacity: 1ml of Cu-resin binds 1-1.2 mg of r-hTBP-1 against 0.25-<br>
0.5 mg/ml of Zn-resin;<br>
• Improvement of the purity level of material after capture step from 30-35% obtained<br>
by the Zn-resin to 40-50% of Cu-resin as shown in Table 2 (quantitative RP-HPLC).<br>
• Reduction of the number of washes step from 3 of Zn-resin to 1 Cu-resin with a<br>
reduction of working time and buffer consumption.<br>

temperature or 6 ±2°C. the pH is adjusted from 3.7 ± 0.2 to 3 ±0.1 by adding 85%<br>
phosphoric acid and conductivity is adjusted from 14 ±3 mS/cm to 22±3 mS/cm by<br>
adding solid sodium chloride and the solution is loaded on the column. After loading is<br>
completed, the column is flushed with 3 BV of equilibration buffer, followed by 4 BV of<br>
wash buffer. Alternatively, the washing with the wash buffer can be eliminated (see the<br>
NB above).<br>
Then elution with elution buffer is started. r-hTBP-1 starts to elute after 180-220<br>
ml. This first part is, discarded and the following 3.5 BV which represent semipurified rhTBP-<br>
1 are collected. The eluted fraction is sampled (5 x 0.5 ml) for IPC and stored at<br>
6 ±2eC for not more than 3 days.<br>
After elution is completed, the column is flushed with about 3 BV of<br>
regeneration buffer. The fraction (1x1 ml) is sampled and discarded it.<br>
For storage, the column is flushed with 3 BV of EtOH 20% (or, alternatively with<br>
10mM NaOH) and stored at W-2°C.<br>

STEP 3 - SP ELUATE ULTRAFiLTRATION<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed at room temperature (23 ±3°C).<br>
The ultrafilter stored in NaOH is washed with water until pH 7.0 ±0.5. The<br>
ultrafilter assembled with membrane is loaded with the r-hTBP-1 solution. The solution<br>
is concentrated up to 50 ml. The retentate fraction is diluted with about 200 ml of water<br>
and concentrated again to 50 ml. The washing step described above is repeated three<br>
more times.<br>
The conductivity of the permeate is checked: if it is 
following step.<br>
If the conductivity value is &gt;0.5 mS/cm repeat once more the present washing<br>
step.<br>
200 ml of 50 mM Tris (at pH 9.0+0.1 and conductivity 0.55+0.1 mS/cm) are<br>
added to the retentate fraction and concentrated again up to 50 ml of solution.<br>
The operation described above is repeated three times, and, if needed,<br>
continued until the pH and conductivity of the permeate fraction is 9.0 +0.2 and 0.55<br>
±0.1 mS/cm respectively.<br>
The retentate fraction is collected and the ultrafiter is washed with three 100 ml<br>
aliquots of 50 mM Tris (at pH 9.0 ±0.1 and conductivity 0.6 +0.1 mS/cm) adding the<br>
washing fractions.<br>
The ultrafilter is washed and sanitized with 0.1 M NaOH (or, alternatively, 0.5 M<br>
NaOH) by recycling for not more than 30 minutes. The ultrafilter is rinsed with water<br>
until permeate pH is 7.0±0.5. The ultrafilter is then stored in 0.01 M or, alternatively,<br>
0.05 M NaOH at 23+3°C.<br>
STEP 4 - ION EXCHANGE CHROMATOGRAPHY ON Q-SEPHAROSE FF<br>
Buffers And Solutions<br>
Equilibration buffer: 50mM Tris pH 9.0±0.1, conductivity 0.55+0.1 mS/cm<br>
Elution buffer: 250mM Tris pH 9.0±0.1,50 mM NaCI conductivity 7.2+0.5 mS/cm<br>
Regeneration buffer: 250mM Tris pH 6.010.1,2 M NaCI or, alternatively, 1.5M NaCI<br>
Sanitization solution: 0.5M NaOH.<br>
Storage solution: 20% Ethanol or 10 mM NaOH.<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed in the following conditions:<br>
Temperature: 2-8°C or, alternatively, room temperature; Linear flow rate: 80-90<br>
ml/cm2/hour<br>
The pH of r-hTBP-1 post Ultrafiltration is checked and, if it is different from pH<br>
9.0 ±0.1, it is adjusted with 1M Tris or 3M HCI. The conductivity is also checked.<br>
The column is packed with Q-Sepharose FF resin, following the manufacturer's<br>
instructions, up to 13 cm bed height.<br>
The Q-Sepharose column is then sanitized by flushing 3 BV of NaOH 0.5 M<br>
followed by 6 BV of water. Then the column is flushed with 4 BV of elution buffer and<br>
equilibrated with 7-8 BV of equilibration buffer, pH and conductivity of column effluent is<br>
checked (pH 9.0 +0.2, conductivity 0.55 ±0.1 mS/cm). The equilibration of the column<br>
is eventually continuously performed if the measured values are not within the<br>
indicated ranges.<br>
The column is then loaded with ultrafiltered r-hTBP-1 prepared as above. After<br>
loading is completed, the column is flushed with 3 BV of equilibration buffer.<br>
Elution is started with the elution buffer. Pure h-hTBP-1 starts to elute after<br>
1BV; collection of r-hTBP-1 is started after the first BV according to the<br>
chromatographic profile; then elution is completed after 5-6 BV.<br>
The column is flushed with 3 BV of regeneration buffer, sample (1 x 1ml) and<br>
then discarded. The column is again flushed with 3 BV of 0.5 M NaOH, rinsed with<br>
water until the pH of the effluent is between 7 and 8. Finally the column is flushed with<br>
3 BV of EtOH 20 % and stored at 2 -8°C.<br>
30-<br>
STEP 5 - NANOFILTRATION ON DV 50 PALL<br>
The stainless steel support is installed in the disc-holder and the DV50 filter (47<br>
mm diameter) is placed on the support. Pall Ultipor® VF Grade DV50 is a filter cartridge<br>
which is normally used for viruses removal. A few drops of water are added on the top<br>
of the disk. The appropriate seals are installed and the disc-holder is closed tightly. The<br>
system is filled with 50 ml of Q elution buffer, closed and connected to the Nitrogen<br>
source.<br>
At the beginning of the flushing the nitrogen is opened at an initial pressure of<br>
0.5 bar and then the vent valve located on the disc-holder is opened in order to purge<br>
the system.<br>
As soon as the first drop of liquid appears at the vent valve on the disc -holder, it<br>
is closed tightly and the nitrogen is opened to the right pressure, 3.0-3.5 bar.<br>
The membrane is then flushed with all the 50 ml of buffer, in order to assure<br>
that the membrane iswet and to eliminate air, if present, between the sheets of the<br>
membrane and perform the integrity test on the filter.<br>
The system is filled with material coming from the previous step and operated<br>
as follows: at the beginning of the filtration the nitrogen is opened at an initial pressure<br>
of 0.5 bar and then the vent valve located on the disc-holder is openend in order to<br>
purge the system .As soon as the first drop of solution starts to appears, the vent valve<br>
of the disc-holder is closed and the nitrogen opened to a pressure of 1.5-2.5 bar.<br>
The nitrogen pressure is kept at 1.5-2.5 bar and then the solution is filtered.<br>
The filtered solution is collected in a container and at the end of the filtration,<br>
the nitrogen source is closed and the vent valve is opened to eliminate excess of<br>
nitrogen.<br>
At the end of the filtration, the system is washed with 5-10 ml of the elution<br>
buffer of the previous step, at the same working pressure of 1.5-2.5 bar.<br>
The washing solution is collected in the same container of the filtered solution<br>
and sampled for IPC.<br>
STEP 6 - HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION ON BUTYL SEPHAROSE FF<br>
Buffers And Solutions<br>
Equilibration buffer: 200 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5+0.1, 1 M Na2SO4 conductivity 90±5<br>
mS/cm<br>
Button buffer: 200 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5+0.1,0.7 M Na2SO4, conductivity 75±5 mS/cm<br>
Regeneration solution:Purified water<br>
Sanitization solution: 1M NaOH<br>
Storage solution :20% ethanol or 10 mM NaOH<br>
Procedure<br>
All operations are performed at a temperature of 23 ±3°C and at a linear flow<br>
rate of 80-90 ml/cm/hour. Solid Na?SO4 is added to Q-Sepharose eluate, post 100 KD<br>
Ultrafiltration under stirring, up to 1M. After that the dissolution of the salt is completed,<br>
the pH is adjusted to 7.5 ±0.1 with 3M HCI. The column is then flushed with 3 BV of<br>
NaOH 1M followed by 4BV of purified water.<br>
The column is again flushed with 5-6 BV of equilibration buffer. The pH and<br>
conductivity of effluent (pH 7.510.2, conductivity 90 ±5 mS/cm) are checked and the<br>
column equilibration is continuously performed, if measured values are out of indicated<br>
ranges.<br>
The solution prepared as above is loaded on to the column and, after loading is<br>
completed, the column is washed with 3 BV of equilibration buffer. Wash with<br>
equilibration buffer is continued.<br>
After 2-3 BV of wash, proteins start to elute. This fraction contains r-hTBP-1,<br>
10-12% about of total, contaminated by cell culture contaminants. This wash is<br>
prolonged until protein elution reaches the plateau giving a broad peak (about 2 BV).<br>
Then elution is started with elution buffer. The first 1 -2 BV are pooled with the<br>
washing sample, since it contains a small amount of contaminants and immediately<br>
thereafter collection of r-hTBP-1 is started.<br>
Purified r-hTBP-1 elutes immediately after the contaminated material and<br>
elution is continued for another 2.5-3 BV. The collection is stopped when the UV<br>
absorbance reaches the 0.5 % of max. After collection of r-hTBP-1, the fraction<br>
(5x0.5ml) is sampled and stored it at 2-8°C for not more than 3 days.<br>
The column is flushed with 3 BV of purified water and the fraction collected.<br>
The column is sanitized with 3 BV of 1 M NaOH and rinsed with water until the<br>
pH of effluent is between 7 and 8.<br>
Then the column is flushed again with three column volume of ethanol 20 %<br>
and stored at room temperature for not more than 2 weeks.<br>
STEP 7 -10 KD ULTRAFILTRATION<br>
The stirred cell type 8400, assembled with the membrane, is loaded with the<br>
Butyl-Sepharose eluate. The solution is concentrated to about 25 ml, under nitrogen<br>
pressure of 3 bars. The retentate fraction is diluted with about 100 ml of water and<br>
concentrated again to 25 ml. The washing step described above is repeated three<br>
further times. The conductivity of the permeate is checked: if it is 
following step can be started. If the conductivity value is &gt;0.3 mS/cm, the washing step<br>
should be repeated.<br>
100 ml of bulk buffer is added to the retentate fraction and concentrated again<br>
up to 25 ml of solution. This operation is repeated three times, and, if needed, until the<br>
pH and conductivity of the permeate fraction is 7.1 ±0.2 and 5.8 ±0.2 mS/cm,<br>
respectively.<br>
The retentate fraction is discarded and loaded on the smaller ultrafiltration<br>
stirred cell type 8050, assembled with the membrane. The retentate is concentrated to<br>
minimum volume (about 3-5 ml). The retentate fraction is collected and the ultrafilter<br>
with bulk is washed by adding the washing fractions to the concentrated r-hTBP-1. The<br>
final volume is adjusted in order to obtain a final concentration of about 20 -30 mg/ml by<br>
OD 280 nm(e= 0.71).<br>
The ultrafilters are washed and sanitized with 0.2 M NaOH by recycling for at<br>
least 30 minutes. The ultrafilters are then rinsed with water unti I the permeate pH is 7.0<br>
±0.5. The ultrafilters are then stored in NaOH 0.01 M at 6 ±2°C.<br>
STEP 8 - MICROFILTRATION<br>
A disposable syringe is connected to a 0.22 \i filter, filled with the r-hTBP-1<br>
concentrated solution, filtered and washed twice with 1 ml of bulk buffer by pooling the<br>
washes with the filtered bulk. The resulting solution is sampled for analytical tests (15<br>
x 0.2 ml) and stored at -20°C.<br>
Results are satisfactory under the quantitation and purity points of view as<br>
shown by the following tables (Tables 4 to 6) reflecting the results of an adequate<br>
number of replications of this process (RUN).<br>
Most critical to the process of this invention is the initial chromatography step on<br>
Cu*2 chelate column. Moreover, it is also important the combination of the SP<br>
Sepharose chromatography at an acid pH with a following Q Sepharose at a basic pH.<br>
In these conditions, strikingly good results have been obtained by subjecting a crude<br>
harvest from CHO production of r-hTBP-1 (Onercept). The capture step in particular<br>
has been shown to be able to 25-30 fold concentrate r-hTBP-1, to effectively reduce<br>
contaminants, to have a satisfactory recovery of the protein and to be scaleable for<br>
industrial manufacturing.<br>
Even more surprising is the fact that outstanding purity data are obtained both<br>
when the starting material is a crude supernatant from serum-containing cell culture<br>
and when it comes from serum-free cultures, as will be shown below.<br>

ANALYTICAL PROTOCOLS<br>
1 Quantitative RP-HPLC- Working procedure<br>
The following method has been used to quantitate the r-hTBP-1 in all<br>
purification samples. It employes a C8 column with acqueous TFA and n -propanol; a<br>
good resolution between r-hTBP-1 and cell culture contaminants is obtained. The rhTBP-<br>
1 can be resolved in one or two peaks depending on the column batch. The<br>
procedure is described here below.<br>

1.2 Calculation<br>
The amount of r-hTBP-1 in each purification sample has been obtained as<br>
follows:<br>
• calculate the response factor (RF) for the standard (BTC10) according to the<br>
formula:<br>
„, TBPlmcg/ml<br>
Kf =<br>
TBP1 peak area<br>
Multiply the r-hTBP-1 peak area of each sample by the RF of the standard<br>
obtaining the concentration of the sample in meg/ml as shown:<br>
TBP1 meg / ml = TBP1 peak area x RF standard<br>
Please note that:<br>
• The BTC10 used as standard has been chosen on the basis of availability;<br>
• The retention time of r-hTBP-1 peak can shift at each new buffer preparation (1 -3<br>
min);<br>
• Concentrated sample has to be diluted in eluant A.<br>
2, Fluorimetric RP-HPLC -Working procedure<br>
Based on previous experiences with other recombinant proteins a RP-HPLC<br>
analysis with a fluorimetric detection has been set up to estimate the purity level of the<br>
residual cell culture contaminants both in r-hTBP-1 bulks and in in process samples<br>
since no immunochemical method was available when the purification study started.<br>
This method was found useful to monitor the removal of cell culture<br>
contaminants in the last purification step, i.e. Butyl Sepharose chromatography and it<br>
was determinant in the selection of the operative conditions of the above step, since it<br>
could be used to analyze the in-process samples and no special materials and/or<br>
apparatus are required. The RP-HPLC is fast (run time 62 minutes) and gives results<br>
comparable to the immunoassay when this test became available. Since a standard for<br>
contaminants was not yet. available, a BSA solution from Pierce was used as standard<br>
to estimate the contamination level in the samples. As the quantitative RP -HPLC, this<br>
test gives a good resolution between r-hTBP-1 and BSA area.<br>

2.2 Calculation<br>
The amount of contaminants in each Butyl purification sample is obtained as<br>
follows:<br>
• calculate the response factor (RF) for the standard (BSA) according to th e formula:<br>
„„ BSA meg injected<br>
KJf —<br>
BSA peak area<br>
Multiply the contaminants peaks area of each sample by the RF of the standard<br>
and by 1000 obtaining the amount of contaminants in the sample injected in ng.<br>
Dividing this value by the amount of r-hTBP-1 injected the contamination in parts per<br>
million is obtained, according to the formula:<br>
. . ^_ contaminants peak areas xRFBSA x 1000<br>
ppm contaminants =<br>
TBPlmg injected<br>
Please note that:<br>
• Test sample has to be diluted in eluant A.<br>
• The contamination of the control sample ranges between 190 and 240 ppm.<br>
3. Analysis and characterization of the r-hTPB-1 Bulk<br>
The analytical methods described hereinafter have been set up and used to<br>
characterize the r-hTBP-1 bulk originated by the new purification procedure.<br>
3.1 SE-HPLC<br>
This method was developed with the aim to quantitate the amount of dimers<br>
and aggregates in the final bulk. The method can discriminate between r-hTBP-1<br>
monomer and its dimer and/or aggregates. This has been proved by testing some r -<br>
hTBP-1 samples after UV treatment, a method widely known to generate aggregate<br>
forms of molecules. Briefly the method is carried out as follows:<br>
3.1.1 Equipment. materials and method<br>
Equipment: Analytical HPLC System<br>
Column: TSK G2000 SWxt cod. 08021 (TosoHaas)<br>
Mobile phase: 0.1M Sodium phosphate pH 6.7,0.1M sodium sulfate<br>
Temperature: 23±3°C<br>
UV detection: 214 nm<br>
Injection volume: 10-100 nl corresponding to 20-30 meg of r-hTBP-1 (by OD)<br>
Injection time: 30 minutes<br>
Standard: BTC10,1.53 mg/ml by OD 280 nm (e= 0.71) 10-20 |j.l injected<br>
r-hTBP-1 bulk: diluted to 1-2 mg/ml by OD 280 nm (e= 0.71) 10-20 |il injected<br>
The purity of the sample is expressed as % of purity of r-hTBP-1 peak / total area ratio.<br>
3.2 IE-HPLC<br>
This method was developed to evaluate the isoform composition in the final<br>
bulk with the aim to replace the chromatofocussing technique generally used for the<br>
above purpose. In contrast to the chromatofocussing, the (EC analysis is more<br>
advantageous because is faster than the above, requires less material (150-200 meg<br>
instead of 1 -2-mg), employes common buffers and does not require pretreatment of the<br>
test sample. Since r-hTBP-1 is a glycoprotein, as a substance of that nature, it is<br>
characterized by different isoforms having each one a different isoelectric point that<br>
determines a different behaviour when tested by an ion exchange analysis. 12 different<br>
peaks, each one corresponding to a glycosilation variant, are obtained. By the present<br>
method all the isoforms of the r-hTBP-1 have been isolated and fully characterized.<br>
Briefly the method is carried out as follows:<br>
3.2.1 Equipment. materials and method<br>

4. Quantitation of r-hTBP-1 by OD<br>
The concentration of the r-hTBP-1 bulks produced in accordance with the<br>
present invention was determined by optical density at 280 nm using the molar<br>
extinction coefficient (e) calculated in house on r-hTBP-1 bulk produced during the<br>
initial phase of the purification of r-hTBP-1. Three representative r-hTBP1 bulks<br>
produced with the new purification process have been used, obtaining e=0.776. This<br>
new extinction coefficient will be used for the scale up and production phases. Since<br>
the concentration of the bulks is in the range of 20-30 mg/ml, it is necessary dilute the<br>
material to 1 mg/ml with bulk buffer (40 mM PBS pH 7.1 ±0.2, 10 mM NaCI), prior to<br>
test the absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
5. Protein determination by Bradford<br>
The Bradford method was used to quantitate total proteins in the r-hTBP-1 bulk<br>
(see Bradford, MM. Analytical Biochemistry 72:248-254, 1976 and Stoscheck, CM..<br>
Methods in Enzymology 182:50-69,1990). The standard used in this test is BSA.<br>
6. In vitro Bioassay<br>
The bioactivity of r-hTBP-1 consists in its capacity to bind TNFa. This test was used to<br>
assay both the in process samples and bulks.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.
