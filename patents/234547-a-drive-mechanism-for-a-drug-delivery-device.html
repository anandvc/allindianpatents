Improvements in and relating to drive mechanisms suitable for use in drug delivery<br>
devices<br>
The technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to drive mechanisms suitable for use in drug delivery devices, in particular pen-type injectors, having dosage setting means, enabling the administration of medicinal products from a multidose cartridge. In particular, the present invention relates to such drug delivery devices where a user may set the dose.<br>
Description of related art<br>
Such drug delivery devices have application where regular injection by persons without formal medical training occurs, i.e., patients. This is increasingly common amongst those having diabetes where self-treatment enables such persons to conduct effective management of their diabetes.<br>
These circumstances set a number of requirements for drug delivery devices of this kind. The device must be robust in construction, yet easy to use in terms of the manipulation of the parts, understanding by a user of its operation and the delivery of the required dose of medicament. Dose setting must be easy and unambiguous. In the case of those with diabetes, many users will be physically infirm and may also have impaired vision requiring the drive mechanism to have low dispensing force and an easy to read dose setting display. Where the device is to be disposable rather than reusable, the device should be cheap to manufacture and easy to dispose of (preferably being suitable for recycling). To meet these requirements the number of parts required to assemble the device and the number of material types the device is made from need to be kept to a minimum.<br>
User operated drug delivery devices comprising a telescopic piston rod are well known within the medical field.<br><br>
DCA62639APC<br>
WO 9114467 Al discloses a dispensing device, comprising a drive mechanism having a telescopic piston rod consisting of a first and a second threaded member having equi-spaced threaded segments with non-threaded segments therebetween. The device further comprises a dose setting sleeve, which surrounds the second threaded member being coupled for rotation and is threadedly engaged with the device shell. The threads of the three said components are of the same lead. The design of this device requires a body length to plunger length ratio of about 1:1 in order to allow dispensing of relatively large doses. However, simple and safe correction of a set overdose remains unresolved without either dispensing the set amount of fluid or dismantling the cartridge.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that the drive mechanism according to instant invention provides a valuable technical alternative for the design of a compact drive mechanism, which requires relatively low force to actuate the mechanism, further providing the advantage of safe dose dialling and dispensing. Furthermore, the drive mechanism according to instant invention provides the advantage of intuitive and easy to use correction of a set dose.<br>

Without any limitation, the instant invention will be explained in greater detail below in annection with a preferred embodiment and with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
?igure 1 shows a sectional view of an embodiment of the drug delivery device according<br>
o the present invention in a first, cartridge full, position;<br>
7igure 2 shows a sectional view of the drug delivery device of Figure 1 in a second,<br>
naximum first dose dialed, position;<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view of the drug delivery device of Figure 1 in a third,<br>

Figure 4 shows a sectional view of the drug delivery device of Figure 1 in a fourth, final<br>
dose dialed, position;<br>
Figure 5 shows a sectional view of the drug delivery device of Figure 1 in a fifth, final<br>
dose dispensed, position.<br>
Referring first to Figure 1 there is seen a drug delivery device in accordance with the present invention. The device comprises a housing 2 within which is located a cartridge 4 containing a medicinal product, means for selecting or setting of the dose of medicinal product to be expelled and means for expelling the selected dose of medicinal product. The housing 2 is generally cylindrical in shape and is divided into two compartments by a web 6 to be described in more detail below. The cartridge 4 is located within a first end of the housing 2 while the dose setting means and the means for expelling the selected dose of medicinal product are located within a second end of the housing 2.<br>
The cartridge 4 may be seemed in position in the first end of the housing 2 by any suitable means. In the illustrated embodiment, a cartridge retainer 12 is secured, by any suitable means, to a first side of the web to retain the cartridge in position. A needle unit (not shown) may be secured to a first end of the cartridge retainer 12. The cartridge 4 further comprises a displaceable piston 10. Advancing the piston 10 towards the first end of the cartridge 4 causes the medicinal product to be expelled from the cartridge 4 through the needle unit. A cap may be provided to cover the needle unit when the device is not in use.<br><br>
e web 6 dividing the housing 2 extends radially inwards from the cylindrical housing to fine an opening 8. A piston rod 14 extends through the opening 8 in the web 6. The jton rod 14 comprises a first inner part 16 and a second outer part 18. The inner part 16 d the outer part 18 of the piston rod are keyed or ratcheted by a one-way ratchet to one other for longitudinal displacement therebetween such that rotation between the inner id outer parts of the piston rod 14 is restrained in a first direction. In the illustrated abodiment, the inner part 16 is keyed to the outer part 18 by at least one radially tending flexible barb 17 extending from the inner part 16 that runs in longitudinally rtending grooves 19 on an inner surface of the outer part 18 of the piston rod 14. In the iustrated embodiment, two diametrically opposed flexible barbs 17 are used, only one of hich may be seen in each view, the other being hidden.<br>
he first inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 is provided along a second end with a threaded ortion 22. The second outer part 18 of the piston rod 14 is provided along a second end rith a helical rib (thread) 24 on an outer surface thereof.<br>
i ratchet 20 is provided in the form of a number of barbs or tangs extending from the Lousing. The ratchet 20 prevents relative rotation between the outer part 18 of the piston od 14 and the housing 2. The ratchet 20 also prevents the outer part 18 of the piston rod .4 from retracting counterwise back into the main housing 4, that is away from the :artridge piston 10.<br>
Fhe dose setting means and the means for expelling the selected dose of medicinal product will now be described in more detail.<br>
A. drive sleeve 30 is located at a second end of the piston rod 14. The drive sleeve 30 is cylindrical. A helical groove (thread) 32 extends along an internal surface of the drive sleeve 30 from a first end of the drive sleeve 30 towards an internal land 34. The land 34 is further provided with a second thread 36 for engagement with the threaded portion 22 on the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14.<br>
The helical groove 32 and the helical rib 24 engage to permit relative rotation between the outer part 18 of the piston rod 14 and the drive sleeve 30. The second thread 36 runs in<br><br>
the threaded portion 22 of the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 to permit relative rotation between the drive sleeve 30 and the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14.<br>
The helical rib 24 and second thread 36 are opposite handed.<br>
A dose dial sleeve 40 is of generally cylindrical form and comprises a first section of first diameter and a second section of second diameter. The first section is disposed between the drive sleeve 30 and the housing 2. An outer surface of the first section and an inner surface of the housing 2 are provided with interengaging features to provide a helical thread 41 between the housing 2 and the dose dial sleeve 40. This enables the dose dial sleeve 40 to rotate about and along the housing 2. The outer surface of the dose dial sleeve 40 is provided with numerals or other indications (not shown) of the possible doses to be dialled. The housing is provided with a window (not shown) through which a numeral or other indication representative of the user's chosen dosage is displayed.<br>
The dose dial sleeve 40 and the drive sleeve 30 are splined together. The inner surface of the dose dial sleeve 40 and the outer surface of the drive sleeve 30 are keyed together to permit only longitudinal displacement therebetween.<br>
The second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 is of the same outer diameter as the housing 2. Within the dose dial sleeve 40 there is a shoulder 42 between the first section of the dose dial sleeve 40 and the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40. An internal surface of the shoulder 42 is provided with a plurality of radially extending longitudinally directed teeth. An internal surface of the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 is provided with a plurality of drcumferentially spaced longitudinally extending saw teeth 54. Each of the saw teeth has a radially directed surface and an inclined surface.<br>
The second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 comprises a first recessed region in which is retained a clutch 48 and a further region in which a button 50 is retained. The button 50 is free to rotate within the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 and is axially connected to the clutch 48. The button 50 is of generally "T" shaped configuration, the stem of which is retained within a peripheral recess provided in the clutch 48. The stem of the button 50 is provided with a peripheral bead that is retained in the peripheral recess, the<br><br>
button 50 being able freely to rotate with respect to the clutch and the dose dial sleeve 40, but being retained axially within the clutch 48.<br>
The clutch includes a disc having a plurality of radially extending longitudinally directed teeth. The clutch 48 is retained on the first inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 such that there is no relative rotation therebetween. When the dose dial sleeve 40 and the clutch 48 are not forced together the respective teeth will ride over one another. Preferably, the radial separation of the respective teeth corresponds to a unit dosage. The clutch 48 is connected to the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 such that relative rotation therebetween is prevented.<br>
A clicker is also provided between the clutch 48 and the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40. In the illustrated embodiment, the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 is provided with an inserted component 44 having an upper part and a lower part depending therefrom. The upper part of the inserted component 44 is provided on an internal surface with a plurality of circumferentially spaced longitudinally extending saw teeth. Each of the saw teeth has a radially directed surface and an inclined surface. The clutch 48 carries a flexible toothed member 52 about an upper region of the clutch 48 aligned with the upper part of the inserted component 44.<br>
The lower part of the inserted component 44 is in the form of a flexible toothed member normally biased in a radially outward direction. The lower part of the inserted component 44 is normally aligned with the teeth 54 provided on the internal surface of the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40.<br>
The radial separation of the teeth on each of the dose dial sleeve 40 and the inserted component 44 preferably corresponds to a unit dosage.<br>
Relative rotation between the dose dial sleeve 40 and the clutch 48 in a first direction will cause the flexible toothed member 52 to ride over the inclined surfaces of the saw teeth on the inserted component 44 to produce a series of clicks. Conversely, relative rotation between the dose dial sleeve 40 and the clutch 48 in a second direction opposite to the first direction will cause the flexible toothed member 52 to abut the radial surface of one<br><br>
of the saw teeth of the upper part of the inserted component and push the inserted component 44 in the second direction. However the lower part of the inserted component 44 is then caused to ride over the inclined surfaces of the saw teeth 54 on the dose dial sleeve 40 to produce a series of clicks.<br>
The first direction may be selected to represent an upward or downward dialling of a dose, the second direction the converse dialling condition subject to a suitable arrangement of the flexible members and longitudinally extending teeth.<br>
In Figure 1, the device is provided with a prefiUed cartridge 4. To operate the device a user must first select a dose. To set a dose the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 is rotated with respect to the housing 2 outward from the housing 2. Since the drive sleeve 30 cannot rotate with respect to the dose dial sleeve 40, this is rotated out from an initial position by an amount corresponding to the desired dosage. The drive sleeve 30 is thus rotated about the helical rib 24 of the outer part 18 of the piston rod. The second thread 36 of the drive sleeve 30 thus also runs in the threaded portion 22 of the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 drawing the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 from the outer part 18 by a distance a function of the dosage chosen by a user. When a dose is dialled, the drive sleeve 30 descends on an inner part 16 of the piston rod a distance equal to the distance required to displace the cartridge piston 10 to expel the selected dose of medical product.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, on dialling up of a dose the relative rotation between the dose dial sleeve 40 and the clutch 48 (fixed rotationally with respect to the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14) causes the flexible toothed member of the inserted component 44 to ride over the teeth 54 on the dose dial sleeve 40 to create a series of clicks. This is an audible confirmation of the dose being dialled. On dialling down, the inserted component 44 is locked to the dose dial, and the flexible member 52 acts on the teeth of inserted component 44. In this way an audible confirmation of the dialling action of a user is produced.<br>
The user may rotate the dose dial sleeve 40 to increase or decrease the amount of the dosage selected to be delivered. Conveniently, the first section of the dose dial sleeve 40 is provided with a marked scale, which together with associated features of the housing,<br><br>
enable a user to determine the amount of the dosage selected to be delivered. The associated features of the housing 2 may include a window formed in the housing 2 or a marking on the housing 2 for alignment with the marked scale.<br>
Once a desired dose has been set (as shown in Figure 2), to deliver the dose the user depresses the button 50 to urge the button 50 and associated clutch 48 towards the first end of the housing 2. When the button 50 is depressed the clutch 48 is driven into the second section of the dose dial sleeve 40 to prevent relative rotation between the dose dial sleeve 40 and the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14. The button 50 may still rotate with respect to the dose dial sleeve and the drive sleeve 30. Further longitudinal movement of the button 50 causes the dose dial sleeve 40 (together with the drive sleeve 30) to rotate towards the first end of the device. As the dose dial sleeve 40 travels into the housing 2, rotation of the drive sleeve 30 (keyed to the dose dial sleeve 40) forces the outer part 18 of the piston rod 14 to move axially with respect to the housing 2.<br>
Rotation of the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14 within the outer part 18 of the piston rod 14 as the button is advanced towards the first end of the housing 2 causes the barb 17 to run across the grooves 19 to provide tactile and audible feedback as each unit of medicinal product is dispensed. It may be seen that preferably, the angular spacing of the grooves 19 preferably corresponds to a unit dose.<br>
The outer part 18 of the piston rod 14 continues to advance until the dose dial sleeve 40 has returned to the initial position in relation to the housing and the drive sleeve has returned to its initial position in relation to the outer part 18 of the piston rod 14 (Figure<br>
Further dosages may be delivered as required. Figure 4 shows an example of a subsequently selected dosage. It will be noted that the drive sleeve 30 has advanced further along the threaded portion 22 of the inner part 16 of the piston rod 14. The position of the drive sleeve 30 along the threaded portion 22 corresponds to the amount of medicinal product remaining in the cartridge 4, such that when the drive sleeve 30 reaches the end of the threaded portion 22 and can rotate no further, this corresponds to no medicinal product remaining in the cartridge 4. It will be seen that if a user seeks to<br><br>
select a quantity of medical product greater than that remaining in the cartridge 4, this cannot be done since when the drive sleeve 30 stops rotating this prevents further rotation of the dose dial sleeve 40 and setting of a larger dose.<br>
Figure 5 shows a device according to the present invention in which the entire medical product within the cartridge 4 has been expelled.<br><br>
