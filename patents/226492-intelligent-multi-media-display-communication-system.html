				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
INTELLIGENT MULTI-MEDIA DISPLAY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to display systems. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to interactive, low power, collapsible, intelligent, multi-media<br>
display systems for use as hand-held, portable communications devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As the demand increases for hand-held, portable communications<br>
devices such as telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and the like, so does<br>
the demand that such devices provide increased capabilities. For example, consumers<br>
are demanding hand-held devices that include telephone capability, paging, fax,<br>
wireless internet access, data storage, and so forth. At the same time, however,<br>
consumers are demanding that manufacturers continue to decrease the size of such<br>
devices.<br>
Such hand-held devices typically include displays. A problem<br>
manifested by the decreased size of these devices is that the displays are often too<br>
small to provide much information, and the information that can be provided is<br>
usually not provided in a visually appealing manner. For example, a typical light<br>
emitting diode (LED) display or liquid crystal display (LCD) on a small, hand-held<br>
telephone or PDA can be unclear and might not be able to display an adequate amount<br>
of information. For example, such a display typically cannot display an entire Web<br>
page. Additionally, such displays are often not full-color displays.<br>
Typical prior art hand held communications devices include a housing<br>
that contains the processing electronics for the device. The housing is the part of the<br>
device that the user holds in his hand and, accordingly, is typically designed to fit<br>
comfortably into a human hand. The display is typically integrated into the housing.<br><br><br>
Consequently, the size of the display is limited by the size of the housing.<br>
Additionally, the manufacturer's ability to decrease the size of the device is impeded<br>
because such displays typically require a relatively large amount of electrical energy<br>
and, therefore, that the housing contain a relatively large power supply.<br>
FIGs. 1A-1C depict several typical prior art hand held communications<br>
devices. FIG. 1A depicts a hand held telephone 10 having a housing 12 and a display<br>
14 that is integrated into the housing 12. As shown, the display 14 is smaller than the<br>
housing 12. The telephone 10 includes a keypad 16 that includes a plurality of<br>
buttons that the user can use to operate the device. The keypad 16 is separate from<br>
the display 14.<br>
Similarly, FIG. 1B depicts a personal digital assistant 20 having a<br>
housing 22 and a display 24 that is integrated into the housing 22. Again, the display<br>
24 is smaller than the housing 22. The PDA 20 includes a keyboard 26 that the user<br>
can use to operate the device 20. The keyboard 26 is separate from the display 24.<br>
FIG. 1C depicts a so-called flip phone 30 having a housing 32 and a<br>
display 34 that is integrated into the housing 32. As shown, the display 34 is smaller<br>
than the housing 32. When the flip cover 31 is closed, it covers a portion of the<br>
display 34. The flip cover 31 can be opened to reveal the covered portion of the<br>
display 34. Alternatively, the display 34 could be integrated into the flip cover 31 of<br>
the phone 30. As the flip cover 31 has a surface area that is no bigger than the surface<br>
area of the housing 32, the display 34 is smaller than the housing 32 in any event.<br>
The flip phone 30 includes a keypad 36, which is separate from the display 34.<br>
In each case, the display is merely one of several elements that is<br>
integrated into (or otherwise coupled to) the housing of the device. In each case, the<br>
display is small, rigid, fixed in size, and generally rectangular in shape.<br>
Consequently, the displays are of limited utility in providing meaningful information<br>
to the user. Thus, there is a need in the art for intelligent multi-media display<br>
communications systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides an interactive, low power, collapsible,<br>
intelligent, multi-media display system according to the invention. Such display<br><br><br>
systems can be used as hand-held, portable communications devices. A display<br>
communications device according to the invention can be an interactive, bi-directional<br>
communications device that includes a housing that can contain a processor; radio<br>
transceiver means for transmitting and/or receiving radio signals; and a collapsible<br>
display that is mechanically coupled to the housing. The display can have a surface<br>
area that is larger than any cross-sectional area of the housing. The housing can<br>
contain a low voltage power supply, such as a thin film power supply.<br>
A processor can be contained within the housing and can be adapted to<br>
receive commands from the display and to form the output radio signals based on the<br>
received commands. The display can be adapted to process touch commands, and the<br>
received commands can be based on the touch commands. A speaker can be coupled<br>
to the processor for transmitting output audio signals, and the processor can be<br>
adapted to extract audio data from the input radio signals, and to provide to the<br>
speaker output audio signals that are representative of the extracted audio data. A<br>
microphone can be coupled to the processor for receiving input audio signals, and the<br>
processor can be adapted to form output radio signals based on the input audio<br>
signals. The processor can be adapted to form the output radio signals by modulating<br>
a carrier signal with a representation of the input audio signal.<br>
The device can be voice activated. The processor can be adapted to<br>
determine whether the input audio signals are telephone signals or commands. The<br>
processor can initiate a connection between the display communications device and a<br>
remote network device, such as by a connection to the internet. The processor is<br>
adapted to determine whether the device is in a telephone mode or a command mode.<br>
If the device is in command mode, the processor is adapted to respond to voice<br>
activation commands. The display can be a flexible display. The communications<br>
device can include a rod that is coupled to the housing and to the display such that the<br>
display can be wound around the rod. The rod can be coupled to the interior or the<br>
exterior of the housing. Alternatively, the display can be wound around the housing<br>
itself. The device can include a locking mechanism for holding the display in an<br>
extended position. The display can be a foldable display.<br><br><br>
The display can be touch responsive. The display can provide touch<br>
signals to the processor and the processor can perform responsive operations in<br>
response to receiving the touch signals. The display communications device can also<br>
include display memory for storing display data that corresponds to information<br>
currently being displayed. The display memory can be embedded into the display<br>
(e.g., in the pixels themselves), or contained in the housing.<br>
The display can include a plurality of organic light emitting devices<br>
(OLEDs). The OLEDs can be ordinary, side-by-side OLEDs, stacked OLEDs<br>
(SOLEDs), or top-emitting or transparent OLEDs (TOLEDs), for example.<br>
Additionally, the OLEDs can be integrated with organic photodetectors.<br>
The display can include a plurality of bistable pixels. The display can<br>
include a plurality of self-configurable pixels. Each pixel can include a local<br>
processor and a memory that contains a pixel address associated with the pixel. The<br>
pixels can be adapted to configure themselves with respect to color, grayscale, and/or<br>
resolution. The pixels can include groups of sub-pixels, where each sub-pixel<br>
includes a number of light emitting devices. The number of light emitting devices<br>
that form a sub-pixel can depend on the color(s), grayscale, and resolution of the<br>
pixel.<br>
The processor can update the display by providing a data packet that<br>
includes a pixel address and a brightness that corresponds to a pixel located at the<br>
pixel address. The processor can be adapted to compare a current image with a<br>
previous image, and to identify one or more pixels having a pixel brightness that<br>
needs to be changed to convert the display from the previous image to the current<br>
image. The processor can provide the display with display data that causes the pixel<br>
brightness of the one or more identified pixels to change. A pixel can include one or<br>
more colored or infrared sub-pixels.<br>
The display can be removably coupled to the housing, and adapted to<br>
be removably coupled to each of a plurality of external devices. The display can be<br>
adapted to automatically configure to the external device to which it is coupled.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 2 depicts a preferred embodiment of an intelligent multi-media<br>
display communications device 100 according to the invention. As shown, the device<br>
100 includes a housing 102 that contains a processor 103, which includes the primary<br>
processing electronics for operating the device 100. Preferably, the device 100 is a<br>
hand-held or pocket-sized device that has an overall shape similar to that of a pen or<br>
pointer, for example, as shown. In such an embodiment, the housing 102 is an<br>
elongated, narrow housing. Preferably, the device 100 includes a dispenser that<br>
contains ink or solid or liquid graphite so that it can actually be used as a writing<br>
implement as well as a communication device. The housing 102 can be made of<br>
plastic, for example.<br>
The housing 102 can also contain a micro-fan that provides cooling for<br>
internal components, as well as positive pressure inside the housing to thereby keep<br>
particles, such as dust, sand, and smoke particles, for example, from entering the<br>
device and contaminating the internal components. Additionally, a carrying case can<br>
be provided to protect the device 100 from water, dust, and the like. Such a carrying<br>
case is depicted in FIG. 8. Preferably, the carrying case 80 is made of metal, plastic,<br>
or the like, with an optional hermetic seal 82 to protect the device from impact and<br>
environmental conditions. Preferably, the carrying case 80 includes a hollow,<br>
elongated body portion 81 and a hollow elongated cap portion 83, and has an overall<br>
tubular shape (such as that of a cigar tube). Preferably, the cap portion 83 is<br>
detachably coupled to the body portion 81. For example, the carrying case can be<br>
designed so that the cap portion 83 can be slid onto and off of the body portion 81 or<br>
threaded onto and off of the body portion 81. Accordingly, the cap portion 83 and the<br>
body portion 81 can each include complementary threads (not shown in Fig. 8) so that<br>
the cap portion 83 can be threaded onto or off of the body portion 81.<br>
Though the hermetic seal 82 can be a separate element, it is preferred<br>
that the hermetic seal 82 is attached to either the body portion 81 or the cap portion<br>
S3. In any event, the hermetic seal 82 is disposed between the cap portion 83 and the<br>
body portion 81 so that the carrying case 80 is hermetically sealed when the cap<br>
portion 83 is coupled to the body portion 81. It is anticipated that the device<br><br><br>
housing will likely be on the order of one inch in diameter. Consequently, it is<br>
anticipated that the carrying case 80 will likely have an interior diameter SOd of about<br>
one inch as well.<br>
The processor 103 can include, but is not limited to, a microprocessor.<br>
Preferably, the processor 103 is a thin film "digital radio on a chip." That is, the<br>
processor 103 provides the capability for processing of analog and digital radio<br>
signals. Such processing can include any number of signal processing techniques,<br>
including data encryption to provide communications that are secure from third party<br>
interception, noise reduction, background noise cancellation, echo cancellation, and<br>
other such techniques for the improvement of sound quality. Data<br>
encryption/decryption capabilities are preferably provided so that the device can<br>
receive, process, and transmit encrypted communications signals. Thus, the device<br>
can be made secure from possible third-party interception. Any well-known data<br>
encryption/decryption techniques can be employed (e.g. RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DES,<br>
Triple-DES, etc.).<br>
The processor 103 can also provide compound radio capabilities (i.e.,<br>
multiple radios or radio functions on a chip). For example, the device 100 can be<br>
adapted to transmit, process, and receive short range, infrared signals, or short,<br>
intermediate, or long range radio-frequency (RF) signals, depending on the particular<br>
characteristics of the environment, the application, and the external device with which<br>
the display communications device 100 is communicating. Such radio capabilities<br>
can be implemented in software on the processor 103.<br>
Preferably, the processor 103 includes control means for selectively<br>
and/or simultaneously controlling the transmission and receipt of communications<br>
signals that contain audio, video, and/or control data. Additionally, the processor 103<br>
preferably includes control means for selectively and/or simultaneously controlling<br>
the display or storage of audio, video, and/or control data that the device receives. A<br>
detailed description of the functions that the processor 103 can perform in a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention is provided below.<br>
The device 100 includes radio transceiver means 104, such as an<br>
antenna, for example, for transmitting output radio signals and receiving input radio<br><br><br><br>
signals. The radio signals can be analog or digital radio signals. The device 100 can<br>
operate in one or more of simplex, half duplex, and full duplex transmission modes. .<br>
The device 100 can accommodate access schemes such as time division multiple<br>
access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), code division multiple<br>
access (CDMA), narrowband CDMA.(NCDMA), and broadband (or wideband)<br>
CDMA (BCDMA), ultra wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM), for example, or any combination of such access schemes. The radio<br>
transceiver means 104 can be adapted to transmit and receive communications signals<br>
via any electromagnetic carrier, such as radio-frequency (RF), infrared, ultraviolet, or<br>
the like, or optically.<br>
Preferably, the device is adapted to process, transmit, and receive<br>
packet-switched communications for compatibility with packet-based mobile<br>
communications networks and can be adapted to conform to any standard, or<br>
combination of standards, such as Universal Mobile Telecommunication System<br>
(UMTS), CDMA-2000, Bluetooth, and WiFi standards 802.1 la, 802.1 lb, 802.1 lg.<br>
Thus, the device can provide communication access to a variety of network systems<br>
by adaptively switching to the appropriate access standard or scheme.<br>
The device can communicate with (transmits signals to or receive<br>
signals from) a single base station, a plurality of base stations (i.e., a network), or any<br>
number of external devices. Thus, a communications device 100 according to the<br>
invention can be a node on a telecommunications network, such as a cellular network<br>
or the internet, for example. The device 100 can transmit communications signals to,<br>
and receive communications signals from, one or more base stations in the network.<br>
Similarly, the base stations can transmit communications signals to, and receive<br>
communications signals from, the device 100. As the device moves from the<br>
proximity of a first base station into the proximity of a second base station, the first<br>
base station can automatically handoff the current communications link with the<br>
device (inbound or outbound communications; voice or data) to the second base<br>
station. Thus, the device 100 can remain in communication with the base stations<br>
(and, consequently, with the far-end device to which it is communicating) as the user<br><br><br>
moves. The device 100 can be an "always-on" device that provides permanent<br>
connections to external devices or networks.<br>
Such a base station could be an external device that includes the<br>
communications electronics (e.g., processor 102, antenna 104. etc.). The display<br>
communications device 100 could be electrically connected in communication with<br>
the base station. Thus, the base station can provide processing power and<br>
communications interfaces for the device 100. Such a base station could be stored in.<br>
or integrated into an airplane, an automobile, a backpack, or the like.<br>
The antenna 104 is electrically coupled to the processor 103.<br>
Preferably, the antenna 104 is coupled to an exterior portion of the housing 102. For<br>
example, the antenna 104 can be embedded into the housing 102 or affixed to the<br>
exterior of the housing 102. Alternatively, the antenna 104 can be coupled to an<br>
interior portion of the housing 102, and may be contained partially or completely<br>
within the housing 102. The device 100 could also be electrically connected to an<br>
external antenna. The external antenna could be plugged into the device and coupled<br>
to the electronic components in the device. Such an external antenna could be stored<br>
in a backpack, for example, so that a user could simply plug the antenna into the<br>
device whenever such use of the device is desired.<br>
Preferably, the antenna 104 is adapted to transmit and receive<br>
broadband, audio/video signals for internet access and telephony. That is, the antenna<br>
is capable of transmitting and receiving full duplex data and voice, and provides<br>
broadband internet access. Preferably, the device 100 provides high speed, mobile<br>
access to the internet, and also includes pager and multi-media text messaging<br>
capabilities, such as may be provided via a multi-media messaging service ("MMS"),<br>
for example.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the device is capable of processing, and<br>
therefore, the radio transceiver means 104 is capable of transmitting and receiving,<br>
narrowband and/or broadband signals. Such broadband signals can be compatible<br>
with third-generation (3G) or fourth-generation (4G) digital radio standards, for<br>
example, though it should be understood that a device according to the invention can<br>
be adapted to conform to any standard or to multiple standards. Final standards for<br><br><br><br>
3G broadband mobile wireless data transmissions via smart phones have been<br>
formally adopted by the ITU Radiocommunication Assembly by approval of the so-<br>
called DVIT-2000 specification. In general, how the device accesses a wireless carrier<br>
is irrelevant. For example, it is anticipated that multi-network devices will be adapted<br>
to connect to the "right" network at the "right" time. That is, given that many -<br>
networks will likely be available to the communications device at any given time, the<br>
device will attempt to connect to the network that is most appropriate for whatever the<br>
device is attempting to do at that time. For example, the device might seek the<br>
network that will yield the best reception, the most capability, the greatest bandwidth,<br>
or the like.<br>
Preferably, the radio transceiver means 104 is adapted to transmit and<br>
receive radio signals having bandwidths of about 5 to 30 MHz, though it is anticipated<br>
that greater bandwidths might be used in future communications applications.<br>
Additionally, data rates of up to about 10 Mbps, or more, are anticipated.<br>
The radio transceiver means 104 can include processing (either in the<br>
antenna itself or in the processor 103) for providing diversity. That is, the<br>
transmitting device can transmit the same signal a number of times (e.g., three), and<br>
the receiving device can use the best of the signals that it receives. Additionally, the<br>
radio transceiver means 104 can be a smart antenna that includes processing (either in<br>
the antenna itself or in the processor 103) to measure, amplify, and otherwise<br>
optimize the input and output signals depending on the characteristics of the<br>
environment in which the signal is being transmitted or received.<br>
The device 100 can also include ultra wideband software defined radio<br>
(SDR) capabilities, such as simultaneous use of airways, or spectrum shifting<br>
according to use, for example, computing power to further sub-divide radio signals<br>
based on their electrical or magnetic polarization, and can share national resources of<br>
the available radio spectrum. The device can also communicate using adaptive<br>
techniques, such as frequency-agile or hybrid communications techniques, for<br>
example.<br>
The communications device 100 can also include a microphone for<br>
receiving input audio signals and one or more speakers for transmitting output audio<br><br><br><br>
signals. The speaker can be used to provide, for example, output audio signals that<br>
are received as part of a telephone conversation, output audio that is downloaded from<br>
the internet as part of a web page, or synthesized human speech produced by the<br>
device itself as a form of communication with the user. The speaker can also be used<br>
to provide identifiable sounds, such as, for example, a ringing sound if a call is<br>
incoming, or a tone (or series of tones) to indicate that a certain action has been taken<br>
(e.g., the device has successfully connected to (or failed to connect to) an internet<br>
service provider). Such sounds could be synthesized.<br>
Preferably, the communications device 100 includes a microtransceiver<br>
108 having both a speaker (audio signal transmitter) and a microphone (audio signal<br>
receiver). The microtransceiver 108 is electrically coupled to the processor 103 and<br>
can be integrated/ embedded into the housing 102 or attached externally thereto. The<br>
processor 103 is adapted to extract audio data from the input radio signals, and to<br>
provide to the speaker output audio signals that are representative of the extracted<br>
audio data. The processor 103 is also adapted to form output radio signals based on<br>
input audio signals received from the microphone.<br>
The device 100 can also include a wireless inductive transceiver 112<br>
that provides audio to, and receives audio from, the user of the device. The wireless<br>
transceiver 112 can be a wireless earpiece, for example, that communicates with the<br>
processor via a wireless link 114. Preferably, the transceiver is an inductive<br>
transceiver that forms audio signals representing the user's speech based on the<br>
transceiver's detection of vibrations caused by the user's speech, for example. Thus,<br>
the processor 103 can convey audio signals to the transceiver 112, and the transceiver<br>
112 can convey audio signals to the processor 103.<br>
The display communications device 100 can include an A/D converter<br>
(as part of the processor 103 or external thereto), to which the microphone (or<br>
transceiver) is coupled. Analog audio signals from the microphone or transceiver are<br>
input to the A/D converter. The digitized output of the A/D converter is provided to<br>
the processor 103. The processor 103 then determines whether the device is in<br>
telephone mode (in which case the audio should be sent via the radio transceiver<br>
means 104), or in command mode (in which case the audio should be interpreted and<br><br><br><br>
an action taken in response). Thus, the microphone can be coupled to the processor<br>
103. and used as an audio input means for both telephonic communications and. to<br>
issue voice commands to the device 100.<br>
Preferably, the processor 103 has the capability to understand and<br>
recognize human speech. Speech recognition techniques are fairly well known, and<br>
are becoming more and more common as computational power and the amount of<br>
available memory continues to increase. The user can speak to the device 100 either<br>
to transmit speech to a third party, or to give the device 100 a command. Preferably, a<br>
display communications device 100 according to the invention includes established<br>
verbal commands or keyboard actions to tell the processor 103 whether it is to<br>
transmit the input speech (i.e., that the device is in telephone mode) or to interpret the<br>
input speech as a command (i.e., that the device is in command mode).<br>
Such voice commands can include voice dialing capability, where the<br>
user can simply speak the telephone number he wishes to call, and the device will<br>
initiate a call to that number. Alternatively, the user can speak a code word (such as<br>
the name of the party he wishes to call). A list of such code words can be stored in<br>
memory, and associated with a respective telephone number or action. If the spoken<br>
code word is in the list, the device will initiate a call to the number associated with<br>
that code word. Similarly, the device 100 can use speech recognition as a security<br>
measure by permitting access to (any or all of) its functionality only if it detects that<br>
the voice of the user is the voice of an authorized user of the device.<br>
If the processor 103 determines that the device 100 is in telephone<br>
mode, then the digitized audio signal can be compressed and encrypted, if desired,<br>
and input to a D/A converter and a modulator where an RF signal is modulated with<br>
the audio signal. The modulated RF signal is then passed to the antenna 104 where it<br>
is transmitted out of the device 100. If the processor 103 determines that the device<br>
100 is in command mode, then the processor 103 performs speech recognition on the<br>
digitized audio input signal using well known speech processing techniques. The<br>
processor 103 can also include a command controller for causing an action to be taken<br>
in response to receiving a voice command. The device can also be coupled,<br>
preferably via a wireless link, to a central server or server pool that provides<br><br><br><br>
additional processing power for the device. Thus, more sophisticated and<br>
computationally intensive processing can be performed, without the need for<br>
increased processing power in the device itself.<br>
Received radio signals can be passed from the antenna 104 through a<br>
demodulator, AID converter, decryptor, and decompressor. Digital audio signals can<br>
be extracted from the received radio signals, and provided to the speaker for audio.<br>
output.<br>
Preferably, the housing 102 also contains a low voltage power supply<br>
107, such as a rechargeable thin film battery. Such batteries are typically less than 10<br>
microns thick, and can have open circuit voltages of about 2-5 V. The batteries can<br>
be cycled thousands of times, and can typically be operated at any temperature up to<br>
the melting point of lithium (180°C). U.S. Patent No. 5,895,731, entitled "Thin-Film<br>
Lithium Battery and Process" describes thin film lithium batteries and processes for<br>
making them. These batteries can be constructed in either prismatic or cylindrical<br>
configuration.<br>
Alternatively, the device 100 can include a power generator, such as a<br>
methanol/hydrogen powered micro fuel cell, direct liquid micro ethanol fuel cell, or<br>
other such fuel cell technology. Such fuel cells typically use hydrogen to react with<br>
oxygen and produce an electrical current. Methanol is typically used in such fuel<br>
cells as it is known to be a good carrier fuel for the hydrogen that fuel cells need.<br>
Methanol-only micro fuel cells are being developed (by Motorola, for example) and it<br>
is anticipated that the use of such fuel cells might be advantageous in a display<br>
communications device according to the invention.<br>
A solar power supply, such as a solar battery, for example, or any<br>
photovoltaic material that can convert sunlight into electricity, can also be used to<br>
provide electrical power to the device 100. Such a solar power supply may allow the<br>
device to operate on solar power alone. Preferably, a flexible, organic photovoltaic<br>
cell can be used. When the device is operating, additional power generated (by the<br>
solar power supply or micro fuel cell, for example) can be used to charge the battery.<br>
When the device is off, all power generated can be used to charge the battery.<br><br><br><br>
According to the invention, an intelligent display system 106 can be<br>
coupled to the housing 102. The display system 106, which can be electrically<br>
coupled to the processor 103, can operate in conventional mode or intelligent mode.<br>
In conventional mode, the whole displayed is refreshed periodically (e.g., 60-100<br>
times per second for video applications; fewer for non-video graphical applications).<br>
In such an embodiment, conventional video processing electronics can be used to<br>
connect the display system 106 to the processor 103 (or other, external video source).<br>
If the display system 106 is operating in an "intelligent mode," then only updated<br>
information needs to be supplied to the display. In such an embodiment, the<br>
processor 103 can control the display 106 directly. The processor 103 can take the<br>
video input, process the information so as to detect changes in the display image from<br>
name to frame, and then send out the appropriate video information to the display<br>
system 106.<br>
The processing power for the display system 106 can be provided by<br>
the processor 103. In such an embodiment, the processor 103 can be adapted to<br>
compare the most recently received image (i.e., the image to be displayed) with the<br>
previously received image (i.e., the image that is currently being displayed). The<br>
processor 103 can then update individual pixels 109 as necessary.<br>
An exemplary application in which a communications device<br>
according to the invention could be coupled to an external video source includes an<br>
application in which the device is used in conjunction with a security system (such as<br>
might be used in a department store, for example). One or more remote cameras (i.e.,<br>
remote to the communications device) could capture images at respective remote<br>
locations. The images could be transmitted (preferably wirelessly) to the<br>
communications device. The display system 106 could then provide to the user of the<br>
communications device, a video display that includes the images captured at the<br>
remote locations. The images could be provided full screen and automatically update<br>
from one camera to the next, or a number of such images could be displayed at the<br>
same time in separate windows on the display.<br>
Alternatively, processing power could be provided locally to each pixel<br>
109. For example, each pixel 109 could be programmed (or initialized) to know<br><br><br><br>
where it is relative to other pixels in the display. Unique addressing codes can be<br>
provided so that each pixel 109 knows what to display. Thus, the pixels 109 in an<br>
intelligent display system 106 can be viewed as nodes on a network. In such an<br>
embodiment, the processor 103 can provide display signals to the pixels 109.<br>
Preferably, a display signal includes an address that corresponds tea particular pixel<br>
(or group of pixels) and content that indicates what the addressed pixel (group) is to<br>
display. The pixel receives the signal and determines from the signal what it is to<br>
display. It is also contemplated that the processor can provide higher level<br>
information to the pixels. In such an embodiment, each pixel 109 can perform<br>
calculations on the higher level information to determine what it has to display.<br>
A power system comprising one or more thin-film batteries or<br>
photovoltaic cells (or some combination of both) can also be attached to the display<br>
system 106. Such a power system could be attached to or directly deposited onto the<br>
backside of the display so that it does not interfere will the visual display provided<br>
thereon. Flexible thin film batteries or photovoltaic cells, for example, can be<br>
laminated onto the display. Thus, the device 100 can be powered by a first power<br>
system when the display system 106 is not extended, and also by a second power<br>
system that provides additional power or takes over for the first power system when<br>
the display system 106 is extended. Examples of flexible photovoltaic cells include<br>
organic, amorphous silicon, or copper indium diselenide. Preferably, where first and<br>
second power systems are provided, the power system attached to the display may not<br>
generate power unless the display is extended.<br>
In a conventional display, driver electronics can provide the necessary<br>
information to each pixel 109 as to its brightness state. In an intelligent display, the<br>
pixels can be interconnected via a common data bus that carries data packets to the<br>
pixels. The data packets can include fields that have values that represent pixel<br>
location, color, and brightness. The data packet can provide either the physical or<br>
logical address of the pixel it is addressing, as well as the brightness state of that<br>
pixel. In such an embodiment, each pixel 109 can include circuitry to decode the<br>
address and brightness information.<br><br><br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the display screen 110 can<br>
have a surface area that is larger than any cross-sectional area of the housing 102.<br>
Though the display screen can have a generally rectangular overall shape as shown, it<br>
should be understood that, in general, a display system 106 according to the invention<br>
has an unconstrained form factor. That is, the substrate onto which an intelligent<br>
display is formed can take on any shape.<br>
Preferably, the display 106 is a high efficieney, interactive, multi-<br>
media display system. The display 106 should emit as much brightness as possible,<br>
with as little power consumption as possible, and can be a light transmissive or light<br>
reflective display. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the display screen 110<br>
comprises a plurality of pixels 109. Each pixel 109 comprises one or more light<br>
emitting elements. The pixels 109 can include organic materials, inorganic materials,<br>
or a combination of organic and inorganic materials. Preferably, the light emitting<br>
elements are high efficiency, organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) that use<br>
phosphorescent emitters such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,303,238 Bl, which is<br>
hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fluorescent emitters, such as<br>
those disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,539,507,4,769,292, and 5,294,870 can also be<br>
used. The organic layers of the OLEDs can include small molecular (i.e., non-<br>
polymeric, unlinked) materials or large molecular (i.e., polymeric, linked) materials.<br>
The OLEDs can be ordinary, side by side OLEDs, or stacked (i.e., multiple<br>
resolution) OLEDs (SOLEDs). TOLEDs, which can be either transparent OLEDS or<br>
top-emission OLEDs, can also be used. Examples of TOLEDs are described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,703,436, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Examples of SOLEDs are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,707,745, the<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
OLED devices are generally (but not always) intended to emit light<br>
through at least one of the electrodes, and one or more transparent electrodes may be<br>
useful in organic opto-elecrronic devices. For example, a transparent electrode<br>
material, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), may be used as the bottom electrode. A<br>
transparent top emission electrode, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,703,436<br>
and 5,707,745, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, may also be<br><br><br><br>
used. For a device intended to emit light only through the bottom electrode, the top<br>
electrode does not need to be transparent, and may be comprised of a thick and<br>
reflective metal layer having a high electrical conductivity. Similarly, for a device<br>
intended to emit light only through the top electrode, the bottom electrode may be<br>
opaque and/or reflective. Where an electrode does not need to be transparent, using a<br>
thicker layer may provide better conductivity, aNd using a reflective electrode may<br>
increase the amount of light emitted through the other electrode, by reflecting light<br>
back towards the transparent electrode. Fully transparent devices may also be<br>
fabricated, where both electrodes are transparent. Side emitting OLEDs may also be<br>
fabricated, and one or both electrodes may be opaque or reflective in such devices.<br>
The anode may be any suitable anode that is sufficiently conductive to<br>
transport holes to the organic layers. Preferred anode materials include conductive<br>
metal oxides, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and zinc tin oxide (ZnTO), and metals.<br>
The anode (and substrate) may be sufficiently transparent to create a bottom-emitting<br>
device. A preferred transparent substrate and anode combination is commercially<br>
available ITO (anode) deposited on glass or plastic (substrate). A flexible and<br>
transparent substrate-anode combination is disclosed in United States Patent No.<br>
5,844,363, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The anode may be<br>
opaque and/or reflective. A reflective anode may be preferred for some top-emitting<br>
devices, to increase the amount of light emitted from the top of the device. The<br>
material and thickness of the anode may be chosen to obtain desired conductive and<br>
optical properties. Where the anode is transparent, there may be a range of thickness<br>
for a particular material that is thick enough to provide the desired conductivity, yet<br>
thin enough to provide the desired degree of transparency. Other anode materials and<br>
structures may be used.<br>
The substrate onto which the OLEDs are deposited may be any<br>
suitable substrate that provides desired structural properties. The substrate may be<br>
flexible or rigid. Plastic and glass are examples of preferred rigid substrate materials.<br>
Plastic and metal foils are examples of preferred flexible substrate materials. The<br>
substrate may be a semiconductor material in order to facilitate the fabrication of<br>
circuitry. For example, the substrate may be a silicon wafer upon which circuits are<br><br><br><br>
fabricated, adapted to control OLEDs subsequently deposited on the substrate. Other<br>
substrates may be used. The material and thickness of the substrate may be chosen to<br>
obtain desired structural and optical properties.<br>
The display system 106 may also include a detachable protective layer<br>
disposed over the display screen to provide mechanical and environmental protection.<br>
Preferably, the protective layer is made of a thin, transparent material, such as plastic,<br>
for example, and can be easily replaced. Thus, such a protective layer can be<br>
disposable.<br>
As depicted in FIGs. 3A-3C, the display 106 can be collapsible. That<br>
is, the display 106 can be formed on a collapsible substrate, and coupled to the<br>
housing 102 in such a manner that the display 106 can be pushed or pulled onto or<br>
into the housing 102. FIG. 3A shows the display 106 fully collapsed; FIG. 3B shows<br>
the display 106 partially extended; FIG. 3C shows the display 106 fully extended. It<br>
is contemplated that the display substrate can be formed from a smart material that is<br>
flexible when the display 106 is retracted, but becomes rigid when the display 106 is<br>
extended.<br>
Thin film deposition processes can be used for depositing the pixels<br>
onto a collapsible substrate to form a collapsible display. Preferably, the display 106<br>
is fabricated on a flexible substrate, such as plastic or thin metal foil.<br>
Active-matrix backplanes that are compatible with plastic substrates<br>
can be fabricated, and deposited into the flexible substrate. The pixels can then be<br>
deposited thereon. Though active-matrix displays are preferred, it should be<br>
understood that passive-matrix displays can also be used in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention. Active-matrix displays typically use transistors to keep<br>
their diodes in an on or off state. Passive-matrix displays, on the other hand, apply<br>
current to the diodes at a specific refresh rate to maintain an image.<br>
OLED display technology is preferred for use on such flexible<br>
substrates because of, among other reasons, its very low substrate temperature during<br>
deposition, as well as its high brightness at low power levels. Small molecule OLEDs<br>
can be used, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,844,363, for example.<br>
Encapsulation to prevent moisture and oxygen from permeating through the plastic<br><br><br><br>
films and degrading the OLED performance is also preferably provided, for example,<br>
such as disclosed on U.S. Patent No. 5.771,562.<br>
Flexible liquid crystal or field emission displays can also be used. For<br>
example, a flexible OLED backlight can be used to illuminate a flexible LCD to<br>
provide a flexible backlit LCD. Additionally, a flexible electrophoretic display<br>
medium, such as "Electronic ink," for example, that is processed into a film for<br>
integration into electronic displays can also be used. ("Electronic ink" is proprietary<br>
to E Ink Corporation.)<br>
The display 106 can be formed as a flexible display that can be rolled<br>
around a rod 113, for example, such as shown in FIGs. 2A-2C. To extend the display<br>
106, the user can simply unwind the display 106 from around the rod 113 (as shown<br>
in FIGs. 2 A and 2B). To collapse the display 106, the user can simply wind the<br>
display 106 around the rod 113 (as shown in FIG. 2C).<br>
In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2 A, the rod 113 is mounted inside<br>
the housing 102. In such an embodiment, one or both ends of the rod 113 can be<br>
rotationally coupled to interior ends of the housing 102. In the embodiment depicted<br>
in FIGs 2B and 2C, the rod 113 is mounted on the exterior of the housing 102. In<br>
such an embodiment, the rod 113 can be rotationally coupled to each of one or more<br>
coupling members 117. Each coupling member 117 can be attached (fixedly or<br>
rotationally) to the housing 102. The rod 113 can be fixedly or rotationally coupled to<br>
each of the one or more the coupling members 117. The display 106 can include an<br>
interface 119 for physically coupling the display 106 to the rod 113. The interface<br>
119 can also provide a path for transporting electrical information between the display<br>
106 and the rest of the device 100.<br>
In still another embodiment, the display 106 can be rolled around the<br>
housing 102. As shown in FIGs. 2D and 2E, the display 106 can include an interface<br>
120 for physically coupling the display 106 to the housing 102. The interface 120 can<br>
also provide a path for transporting electrical information between the display 106 and<br>
the rest of the device 100. To extend the display 106, the user can simply unwind the<br>
display 106 from around the housing 102 (as shown in FIG. 2D). To collapse the<br><br><br><br>
display 106, the user can simply wind the display 106 around the housing 102 (as<br>
shown in FIG. 2E).<br>
Preferably, the display 106 is fabricated from materials that provide a<br>
display having as small a radius of curvature as possible. For example, the display<br>
106 could be thin and flexible enough to roll or fold into a housing 102 that is about<br>
the size of an ordinary pen or pointer, or onto a rod that is connected to the housing,<br>
as discussed above. For example, the substrate should be thin enough so that the<br>
display, while retracted into the housing, for example, has as small a cross-sectional<br>
area as possible (transverse to the long direction of the rod). Similarly, the<br>
components that are deposited onto the substrate should be small enough and flexible<br>
enough to provide for a sufficiently small radius of curvature. OLED technology is<br>
preferred because of the very small pixel size that can be attained (such as the so-<br>
called "nanopixels," for example).<br>
Preferably, the display 106 is auto-collapsible (much like a tape<br>
measure). For example, like a tape measure, tension can be placed on the rod 113 so<br>
that the display 106 will be wound around the rod 113 automatically unless the<br>
display 106 is locked into an extended position. The display 106 can also include an<br>
auto lock feature so that when the display 106 is fully extended, the locking<br>
mechanism is automatically latched. While the display 106 is locked, the user can<br>
cause the display 106 to wind around the rod 113 or housing 102 by unlatching the<br>
locking mechanism. For example, the locking mechanism can be a latch that can be<br>
set at any point, or which is automatically set when the display 106 is fully extended,<br>
or at any of a number of points while the display 106 is being extended. The display<br>
106 can include an auto-collapse button 111 that, when pressed, causes the display<br>
106 to collapse. For example, in an embodiment wherein the display 106 winds<br>
around a rod 113, the auto-collapse button 111 can cause the rod 113 to rotate and the<br>
display 106 to be wound around the rod 113. Alternatively, the auto-collapse button<br>
can release the locking mechanism, thereby causing the display to wind around the<br>
rod 113 or housing 102. The device 100 can also include a motor (not shown) that<br>
causes the display 106 to spool onto or off of the rod 113 or housing 102. Preferably,<br>
the motor is sized and shaped such that it can be contained within the housing 102.<br><br><br><br>
The processor 103 is adapted to extract display data from the input<br>
radio signals, and to provide a representation of the display data to the display 106. In<br>
a preferred embodiment of the invention, the protocol for communications between<br>
the communications device 100 and external devices provides for a significant<br>
reduction in the required communications bandwidth relative to current<br>
communications protocols. For example, in a system according to the invention,<br>
information for every pixel 109 need not be transmitted continuously. Rather, each<br>
pixel 109 can be provided with enough "intelligence" to determine what it is expected<br>
to display based on higher level information that is provided via the communications<br>
from the outside world. Additionally, the display 106 can be updated by changing<br>
only those pixels 109 that need to be changed as the image changes. For backward<br>
compatibility, however, the device 100 preferably includes the capability to operate<br>
using existing protocols (i.e., to translate from the old protocol to the new).<br>
The display communications device 100 can also include a memory<br>
105, which can be contained in the housing 102 or embedded into the display 106.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the device 100 can include a removable memory, such<br>
as a memory card, and a miniature drive for reading from and writing data to the<br>
memory card. The memory can be used for temporary or permanent storage of audio,<br>
video, or other data that the communications device 100 receives, transmits, or uses<br>
during its operation. Such a memory could include, for example, a multi-mode<br>
memory card or "memory stick" that includes" logic that provides multiple<br>
functionality for interfacing the communications device with different external<br>
devices.<br>
Such a memory can also reduce the bandwidth requirement between<br>
the display system 106 and an external device by storing information about the<br>
current display. As a result, the processor 103 can pass only information that updates<br>
the display 106. In a preferred embodiment of an intelligent display, the display<br>
system 106 can include individual memory in each pixel 109. Basic memory cells,<br>
such as a few transistors, could be used to provide the required memory. The use of a<br>
few transistors at each pixel 109 reduces or eliminates the need to keep moving<br><br><br><br>
information from the outside to the pixel. Alternatively, an external chip could be<br>
used to make it easy for pixel memories to talk to one another.<br>
The memory could be implemented as a large area electronic<br>
backplane, such as an active matrix display. For example, a pixel matrix could be<br>
overlaid on a backplane such that a number of transistors would be associated with<br>
each pixel. Currently, the display backplane is built first, and then the light emitting<br>
elements are deposited onto it. Typically, the display backplane includes electronics.<br>
In an intelligent display system according to the invention, additional electronics<br>
could be added for pixel-specific memory. Preferably, amorphous silicon,<br>
polysilicon, organic thin film technologies (TFTs), or other TFTs are used.<br>
Processing and logic could also be integrated into such a large area electronic<br>
backplane.<br>
Preferably, a display communications device 100 according to the<br>
invention can be voice activated. For example, a user might want to display email or<br>
a flight schedule, to zoom into an image, or to move an image from one part of the<br>
screen to another. The user desiring to view his emails, for example, can simply<br>
command the device to show emails by speaking a command such as "show email"<br>
into the microphone. The processor 103 determines that the input audio is a voice<br>
command (rather than part of a telephone conversation). The processor 103 can<br>
include logic to receive the voice command, interpret it, and respond accordingly. For<br>
example, the processor 103 might retrieve the user's email from the user's email box,<br>
which can be stored in memory 105 in the communications device 100. Alternatively,<br>
however, the processor 103 can initiate an Internet connection to retrieve the user's<br>
email. In any event, the processor 103 causes the display 106 to display the user's<br>
email as a result of the user's voice activation command. In general, voice activation<br>
technology can be employed to cause the device 100 to perform any function that the<br>
device 100 can otherwise perform.<br>
Additionally, voice activation may be used to actively configure the<br>
display device 106. For example, the user may speak "make call" or "type e-mail"<br>
and the display device 106 may auto-configure to display a phone keypad 132 or<br><br><br><br>
keyboard 134. Auto-configuration may be initiated by a using an engaging means<br>
located either on device 100 or display device 106.<br>
The display 106 can have a display border 115, as shown, that can<br>
include a microphone 121, a speaker 123, and a digital imager 125. The imager 125<br>
can include a thin film device that is integrated or embedded into the display screen<br>
110. The imager 125 can be an organic or a small molecule polymer or hybrid<br>
inorganic detector. For example, each pixel 109 (or some subset of pixels) could have<br>
a sensing element to receive light within its field of view. Alternatively, through the<br>
use of large area imaging technologies, which can be implemented in software as part<br>
of the imager 125, the display screen 110 can, as a whole, be a combined video<br>
transmitted / receiver. In another embodiment of the invention, the imager 125 is<br>
separate from the display screen 110. For example, the imager 125 can be embedded<br>
into or attached onto the display border 115 or the device housing 102. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the imager 125 is a thin film device that is thin enough and flexible<br>
enough so that the collapsible nature of the display 106 is unaffected. The imager can<br>
produce digital data corresponding to still photos or video. The digital data can be<br>
stored to memory (either to fixed memory in the housing 102 or to a removable<br>
memory card), and retrieved for later display. In this context, the device 100 can act<br>
like a digital camera or video camera.<br>
A display communications device that includes such a digital imager<br>
can be used, for example, to provide gesture tracking. Such a device could capture<br>
images of a user gesticulating. A sequence of such images could then be compared to<br>
certain known commands (the mapping for which is stored in the device's memory or<br>
some remote memory location). For example, a user in distress could provide a<br>
sequence of gestures that, when translated, indicates the user's current location. The<br>
device could capture the sequence of images and translate the sequence into a<br>
message that includes the location of the user. Gesture tracking techniques, and<br>
software to perfonn them, are well known in the art.<br>
The display 106 can include a speaker 123, if desired, so that a stereo<br>
effect can be achieved. When the display 106 is collapsed, the speaker 108 on the<br>
housing 102 provides output audio. When the display 106 is extended, however, the<br><br><br><br>
speaker 123 on the display 106 is automatically activated. As with the video imager,<br>
it is preferred that the speaker 123 is a thin film speaker that is thin enough and<br>
flexible enough so that the collapsible nature of the display 106 is unaffected.<br>
Preferably, the display system 106 includes a touch responsive screen<br>
110. In a touch responsive screen, components can be added into the screen itself, or<br>
overlaid on top of the screen 110, so that the device 100 can detect the presence and<br>
position of any touch input. For example, the user can use such a touch responsive<br>
screen, in conjunction with a stylus (or the user's finger) to write on the screen. The<br>
screen detects the touch of the stylus, and displays a contrasting color (or grayscale)<br>
where the stylus has met the screen. Additionally, the display system 106 can detect<br>
the writing and convey to the processor 103 coordinate data that corresponds to the<br>
pixels that have been "touched." The processor can then cause the coordinate data to<br>
be transmitted to a far-end communications device. The far-end device can then<br>
process the received coordinate data, and display the same writing on its screen as that<br>
displayed on the user's screen. Thus, the device can be used as an "electronic pen,"<br>
via which a user of the device can transmit written information from his device to a<br>
far-end device.<br>
Similarly, a set of several communication devices according to the<br>
invention can be communicatively linked and thereby used as a "team tool" that<br>
enables a group of users of the several devices to share information among the group.<br>
In a first such configuration, communications output from any device in the set can be<br>
provided to each of the other devices in the set, such that each of the users<br>
experiences the same information at his respective device. Alternatively, each of the<br>
devices in the set can be communicatively coupled to a single display, such that<br>
communications output from any device can be provided to the display. Preferably,<br>
the device is capable of providing three-dimensional images moving in real time. For<br>
example, holographic images can be provided for video conferencing and the like.<br>
Such a device can also include video game software.<br>
A touch responsive screen also enables the display system 106 to<br>
detect and process user entered touch commands. This information can be used, for<br><br><br><br>
example, to activate switches displayed on the screen 110, or to highlight specific<br>
points on the display 106 (for example, as a zoom reference point).<br>
The device 100 can also include fingerprint (including thumbprint)<br>
recognition as a security measure by permitting access to (any or all of) its<br>
functionality only if it detects that the user's fingerprint is that of an approved user.<br>
For such a purpose, the device can include a receptor (on the housing or the display<br>
system) that scans the user's fingerprint. The receptor communicates the fingerprint<br>
pattern to the processor, which includes processing for comparing the fingerprint<br>
pattern to one or more fingerprint patterns stored in memory. If the fingerprint pattern<br>
matches one of the stored patterns, then the user is authorized, and the device's<br>
functionality (or secure functionality) is enabled.<br>
Similarly, the device can include retinal, iris, or other such eyeprint<br>
recognition as a security measure by permitting access to (any or all of) its<br>
functionality only if it detects that the user's eye is the eye of an approved user. For<br>
such a purpose, the device can include a receptor (on the housing or the display<br>
system) that scans the user's eyeprint. The receptor communicates the eyeprint<br>
pattern to the processor, which includes processing for comparing the eyeprint pattern<br>
to one or more eyeprint patterns stored in memory. If the eyeprint pattern matches<br>
one of the stored patterns, then the user is authorized, and the device's functionality<br>
(or secure functionality) is enabled.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts a preferred embodiment of a display communications<br>
device 100 according to the invention having a touch responsive display 106 with a<br>
telephone keypad 132. The user can use the telephone keypad 132 on the display 106<br>
just as one would use the telephone keypad buttons of an ordinary telephone. The<br>
display system 106 detects the user's touch, determines which portion of the screen<br>
the user has touched, and communicates to the processor 103 a representation that<br>
indicates that the user has touched that portion of the screen. For example, each pixel<br>
can be assigned a coordinate representation (in the x-y plane, for example). When the<br>
user touches the display screen, the display system detects that certain pixels have<br>
been touched, and relays the corresponding coordinates to the processor. The<br>
processor 103 processes the touch commands according to which portion(s) of the<br><br><br><br>
screen the user has touched. For example, if the screen is currently displaying<br>
telephone keypad buttons, the processor can be programmed to initiate a telephone<br>
call to the "touched" telephone number.<br>
Similarly, FIG. 5 depicts a preferred embodiment of a display<br>
communications device 100 according to the invention having a touch responsive<br>
display 106 with a keyboard 134, such as one might find on a personal digital<br>
assistant or pager for example. The user can use the screen 110 as a keyboard for<br>
accessing the Internet, communicating via email, paging, etc. Again, the display<br>
system 106 detects the user's touch, determines which portion of the screen the user<br>
has touched, and communicates to the processor 103 a representation that indicates<br>
that the user has touched that portion of the screen. The processor 103 processes the<br>
touch commands according to which portion(s) of the screen the user has touched.<br>
FIG. 6 depicts a preferred embodiment of a display communications<br>
device 100 according to the invention having a display screen 110 that is capable of<br>
displaying an entire Web page. Preferably, the display screen 110 provides full color<br>
display and is sized and shaped to display a Web page in a visually appealing format.<br>
The device can include browser software that enables the user to browse the Internet<br>
and download such web pages. The download technology can be applet or Java<br>
based, for example, or any other download technology can be used.<br>
Preferably, the display system 106 can display multiple images on the<br>
display screen 110. That is, the display system 106 can provide split screen displays,<br>
such as those that might be downloaded from a web site, or can provide multiple<br>
active areas at the same time. For example, the display screen 110 can include a first<br>
sub-display (or window) that displays web pages as the user downloads them from the<br>
internet, and a second sub-display (or window) that displays the user's email at the<br>
same time. The user can move from window to window to interact alternatively with<br>
the internet or his email. Thus, a display communications device 100 according to the<br>
invention can be used to perform multiple functions concurrently.<br>
Preferably, the display system 106 is self-configurable. In one<br>
configuration, the sub-display might change grayscale by changing the number of the<br>
16 pixels that are on (or off) at a given time. The display can reconfigure itself as a<br><br><br><br>
matter of grayscale versus resolution based on to the needs of the image to be<br>
displayed. That is, the sub-display can reconfigure itself, based on whether a more<br>
precise grayscale or more resolution is desired for the current display. For example,<br>
for a particular image, four gray levels might be adequate but more resolution is<br>
desirable. In such an application, the 4x4 sub-display could reconfigure itself as four<br>
2x2 sub-displays, each having four gray levels. Similarly, four 4x4 sub-displays<br>
could work together to form an 8x8 display having less resolution, but 64 gray levels.<br>
In one embodiment, the display can include bistable pixels. A bistable<br>
pixel operates in a binary mode (i.e., each pixel is either on or off), and stays in its<br>
current state until told to change. The pixels can include TFTs, or other electrical<br>
components, which can be connected to provide memory. The TFTs can be used to<br>
form conventional memory elements, which store data such as the associated pixel's<br>
location or brightness. If the information being displayed on the display is such that<br>
any specific pixel's brightness state does not need to change, then no information<br>
needs to be supplied to that pixel, and the internal local memory can retain the<br>
brightness information stored in the pixel memory. The local memory can then<br>
provide to the pixel circuit the information necessary to control the pixel brightness.<br>
The bistable pixels can include organic or inorganic photodetectors as<br>
part of the bistable circuit. Additionally, the bistable pixels can be made using purely<br>
electrical feedback. Examples of bistable pixels for use in such a display are provided<br>
in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/219,760, filed August 16, 2002, entitled "An<br>
Organic Photonic Integrated Circuit Using An Organic Photodetector An A<br>
Transparent Organic Light Emitting Device," the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In such a display, gray-scale can be achieved by defining each pixel as<br>
a group of sub-pixels (for example, 4, 8, 16, or 64), and turning on or off the<br>
appropriate number of sub-pixels. Thus, the display can be used at maximum<br>
resolution, with each pixel either on or off, or at lower resolutions, with each pixel<br>
displaying gray scale information.<br>
In a color display, each pixel can include three sub-pixels - one for<br>
each of the primary colors (i.e., red, blue and green). As shown in FIG. 9A, a pixel 90<br><br><br><br>
can be arranged as a 1x3 matrix of sub-pixels 92R, 92G, 92B. That is, the three<br>
colored sub-pixels 92R, 92G, 92B can be arranged linearly. Thus, each sub-pixel<br>
92R, 92G, 92B on the display 106 can be addressed using the same number of row<br>
lines, for example, as if each pixel 90 had a single address (e.g., in a monochrome<br>
display), with three times the number of column lines.<br>
Another well-known pixel arrangement is the so-called "quad-green"<br>
architecture. In this embodiment, which is depicted in FIG. 9B, the pixel 90 includes<br>
a second green sub-pixel 94G in addition to the other primary colored sub-pixels 92R,<br>
92B, 92G. The sub-pixels 92, 94 are arranged in a 2x2 matrix as shown. Thus, each<br>
sub-pixel 92, 94 on the display 106 can be addressed with twice the number of row<br>
lines and twice the number of column lines as if each pixel 90 had a single address.<br>
Normally, it will be desirable for the display 106 to be a visible as<br>
possible. However, there certain applications in which it might be desirable for the<br>
display 106 not to be seen by the unaided human eye. To accommodate such<br>
applications, the display system 106 can also include the use of infrared (IR) pixels so<br>
that at night, the display 106 can only be seen using infrared sensing equipments, such<br>
as night vision goggles, for example. The display system 106 can include a pixel<br>
architecture, such as depicted in FIGs 9C and 9D, for example, that includes four sub-<br>
pixels: one green 92G, one red 92R, one blue 92B, and one infrared 921. In such an<br>
embodiment, power can be supplied to all sub-pixels all the time or, to reduce power<br>
consumption, only to the colored sub-pixels 92G, 92R, 92B when color is desired, and<br>
only to the infrared sub-pixels 921 when color is not desired. As shown in FIG. 9C,<br>
the sub-pixels 92, 94 could be arranged linearly, or, as shown in FIG. 9D, the sub-<br>
pixels 92, 94 could be arranged in a 2x2 matrix.<br>
It is also contemplated that a display system 106 according to the<br>
invention can be detachably coupled or removably connected to the housing 102, as<br>
well as to any number of external devices, such as portable phones, laptop or personal<br>
computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), internet appliances, televisions, or the<br>
like. In this context, the display system 106 can be coupled to an external device in<br>
any fashion that provides for the transfer of information, either directly or remotely,<br>
between the display system 106 and the external device. Examples of wireless<br><br><br><br>
connectivity that could be used for this purpose include, without limitation, radio,<br>
optical, infra-red, or other such communications carriers. In such an implementation,<br>
the display system 106 can be adapted to determine an identity of the external device<br>
to which it is communicating, and to respond accordingly. For example, the user of<br>
an intelligent display system according to the invention can connect the display<br>
system 106 to a cellular phone (or other such external device). Thereafter, the display<br>
system 106 assumes the attributes of the display included with the external device,<br>
and thus can provide a better display than the display included with the external<br>
device.<br>
In these cases the display system 106 recognizes, the display<br>
characteristics of the system to which it is connecting. For example, if the display<br>
system 106 were connected to a cell phone, it could determine the resolution and gray<br>
scale content, for example, of the cell phone display. The display system 106 could<br>
then adjust the image of the cell phone display so that it could be viewed<br>
appropriately at different sizes. Each pixel of the cell phone display could be mapped<br>
onto a corresponding pixel 109 in the display system 106. Alternatively, if a larger or<br>
more resolute image is desired, each pixel from the cell phone could map onto a<br>
plurality of pixels of the display system 106.<br>
Similarly, the display could be detachably coupled to the housing so<br>
that any of a number of displays could be coupled to the housing at a given time. For<br>
example, a user of the device might wish to use a certain display (having a first<br>
display resolution, say) under certain circumstances, but a different display (having a<br>
better resolution) under different circumstances.<br>
The display communications device 100 can also include location<br>
finding capabilities, such as global positioning. For example, the antenna 104 can<br>
receive global positioning signals from one or more global positioning satellites. The<br>
processor 103 can then determine the location of the device 100 from the global<br>
positioning signals. The processor 103 can pass data to the display system 106 so that<br>
the display system 106 can provide a visual representation of the location of the<br>
device 100 based on the received global positioning signals.<br><br><br><br>
Figure 7 depicts a preferred embodiment of a display communications<br>
device 100 according to the invention that includes a display system extension 140.<br>
As shown, the display extension can also be collapsible. Preferably, the display<br>
system extension 140 includes a collapsible display screen extension 144. The<br>
display screen extension 144 can be made as described above in connection with<br>
display system 106. Preferably, the display screen extension 144 can be wound<br>
around a rod (not shown) that is contained within an extension housing 142. Thus, a<br>
display communications device 100 having a display system extension 140 can take<br>
the form of a "pen and pencil" set.<br>
The display system 106 and the display system extension 140 are<br>
coupled to one another via a display extension interface 146. When the display<br>
system extension 140 is coupled to the display system 106, the device 100 detects that<br>
the display system extension 140 is present. Thereafter, the processor 103 can<br>
provide display data for both the display system 106 and the display system extension<br>
140. For example, a display data bus can extend through the display system 106,<br>
culminating at the display extension interface 146. Similarly, the display system<br>
extension 140 can include a display data bus that also culminates at the display<br>
extension interface. Thus, the processor can communicate display data to both the<br>
display system 106 and the display system extension 140 via a common bus. The<br>
display extension 140 can also include additional memory.<br>
Information input/output to/from the device could be accomplished by<br>
way of the extendable display system described above, and also by way of a low-<br>
information display system that is disposed on the exterior surface of housing 100.<br>
The display system could be communicatively coupled to the processor 103, and be<br>
sized and shaped such that it can display telephone numbers, names, and the like.<br>
The device 100 may also be removably connected to a micro-display,<br>
which can be incorporated into a user's headset, eyeglasses, etc., or to a wrist-<br>
wearable device, such as a watch, for example, to thereby provide greater privacy for<br>
the user while the device is in use. The device 100 may also be connected to an<br>
automobile's heads-up display (HUD) or a Transparent Organic Light Emitting<br><br><br><br>
Device (TOLED) display, to display information onto an automobile windshield, for<br>
example.<br>
The device can also include a keypad disposed on the housing. The<br>
keypad could be communicatively coupled to the processor 103, and be sized and<br>
shaped such that the user can enter telephone numbers, text, data, or the like (perhaps<br>
with the aid of a pin or pencil point). Thus, the device can be operated without the<br>
need for the main display system 106 to be extended. Similarly, the device 100 may<br>
be coupled to an external input or output device, such as a keyboard, mouse, display,<br>
etc., in any fashion that provides for the transfer of information, either directly or<br>
remotely, between the display system 101 and the external input or output device.<br>
It is also anticipated that the device can be used as; a remote control<br>
device to control external devices such as lighting, stereo, televisions, appliances, and<br>
the like. The device can be programmed (either pre-programmed or by the user) such<br>
that the user can press the appropriate button(s) on the device and thereby cause the<br>
device to transit the appropriate signal, preferably infrared, to control the external<br>
device.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the invention, the communications<br>
device can also include a collapsible housing. Using any of the techniques described<br>
above, the display could be coupled to the exterior of the housing and wound around a<br>
rod or the housing itself, or the display could be coupled to the interior of the housing<br>
so that the display can be retracted into the housing and the housing wound on itself.<br>
As depicted in FIGs. 10A and 10B, the display system 206 can be<br>
integrated into or onto a collapsible housing 202. In such an embodiment, the device<br>
200 could be made to resemble a conventional PDA, as shown in FIG. 10A for<br>
example. However, according to the invention, both the housing 202 and the display<br>
206 could be collapsible such that a user can roll the entire device 200 onto itself (as<br>
shown in FIG. 10B).<br>
As depicted in FIGs. 10C-10E, a communications device 210 can<br>
include a collapsible housing 212 and a collapsible display 216 that can be stored at<br>
least partially within the housing 212 (as shown in FIGs 10C and 10D) or extended<br>
out of the housing 212 (as shown in FIG. 10E). The collapsible display 216 can be<br><br><br><br>
coupled to the collapsible housing 212 via a rod 213 which can be rotationally<br>
coupled to an interior portion of the housing (as shown in FIGs. 10C-10E) or to an<br>
exterior portion of the housing (such as depicted in FIGs. 2B and 2C, for example).<br>
As shown in FIG. 10C. the housing 212 can be collapsed with the<br>
display 216 stored at least partially inside the housing 212. The housing 212 could be<br>
unfurled, as shown in FIG. 10D, while the display 216 remains at least partially inside<br>
the housing 212. The display 216 could then be extended out of the housing 212 as<br>
shown in FIG. 10E.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 10F, a communications device 220 can include a<br>
collapsible housing 222 and a collapsible display 226 that is attached to the<br>
collapsible housing 222 such that each of the collapsible display 226 and the<br>
collapsible housing 222 can be wound onto itself.<br>
Thus, there have been described interactive, low power, collapsible,<br>
intelligent, multi-media display systems for use as hand-held, portable<br>
communications devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous<br>
changes and modifications can be made to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, and that such changes and modifications can be made without departing<br>
from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, that the appended claims<br>
cover all such equivalent variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of the<br>
