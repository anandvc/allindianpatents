Apparatuses and method for forming objects<br>
The invention relates to apparatuses and a method for forming, particularly by injection-moulding or compression-moulding, objects made of plastics. The apparatuses and the method according to the invention are particularly suitable for producing caps for containers and bottles, heads of tubes for packaging and preforms for bottles made, for example, of polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) .<br>
Italian patent application RM 2002A000099 discloses an apparatus for producing, by compression-moulding, preforms in plastics, for example PET, to be used in the blowing of bottles. The apparatus comprises a carousel that is rotatably movable around a vertical axis and is peripherally provided with a plurality of moulds. Each mould comprises a die and a punch that is movable in relation to the die in a vertical opening direction. The punch can move between an opening position in which between the die and the punch it is possible to introduce a dose of plastics to be formed, and a closing position in which the punch engages with the die, defining a forming chamber inside which the preform is formed.<br>
The die comprises a fixed part connected fixedly relative to the carousel and suitable for shaping a portion of substantially cylindrical preform from which the body of the bottle will be subsequently obtained by blow-moulding. The die furthermore comprises two movable elements suitable for externally shaping the neck of the preform, which is provided with a threaded portion and with a collar provided with undercuts. The movable elements each have a WC"-shaped portion internally provided with a forming surface suitable for obtaining the neck of the preform from a part of the dose, and having an end fixed relative to a lever. The levers are in turn hinged on a column parallel to the opening direction of the mould and can rotate on a plane orthogonal to the opening direction between a disengagement position in which the movable elements are spaced from one<br><br>
another and a contact position in which the movable elements are in contact with one another in such a way as to define a portion of the forming chamber. In order to keep the radial overall dimensions of the carousel on which the moulds are assembled limited, the length of the levers is rather reduced, i.e. the "C"-shaped portions of the movable elements are near the column.<br>
The latter is slideable parallel to the opening direction of the mould between an upper position, in which the movable elements are at a certain distance, measured parallel to the opening direction on the fixed part of the die, and a lower position in which the movable elements are in contact with this fixed part.<br>
At the start of the forming phase, a dose of plastics is introduced into the fixed part of the die. The punch is located in the opening position, the movable elements are arranged in the disengagement position and the column is in the upper position in which the movable elements are kept far from the fixed part of the die. Subsequently, a cam mechanism moves the movable elements from the disengagement position to the contact position, after which the column moves to take the movable elements to the lower position in contact with the fixed part of the die. Also the punch moves parallel to the opening direction until reaching the closing position in which forming of the preform occurs. At the end of the forming phase, the operations disclosed previously have to be performed again in reverse order.<br>
A drawback of the mould disclosed in RM 2002A000099 is that relatively long strokes are necessary to move the movable elements from the contact position to the disengagement position so as to be able to extract a preform from the mould. The movable elements in fact have to rotate in relation to one another by an angle of significant amplitude in order that the ends of the "C"-shaped portions that are fixed relative to the lever move away from one another by an amount such as to enable the undercuts formed on the neck of<br><br>
the preform, and in particular the collar, to be completely disengaged from the movable elements.<br>
Furthermore, in the mould disclosed in RM 2002A000099 it is necessary to provide a first driving mechanism, normally of hydraulic type, to move the punch between the opening position and the closing position and a second driving mechanism, comprising the column and the cam mechanism and arranged outside the punch and the die, to move the movable elements. This significantly complicates the structure of the apparatus. Furthermore, it is not always easy to manage the first and second driving mechanism in a coordinated manner so as to move the punch and the movable elements with precision and according to a preset sequence. The doses of plastics that are introduced inside the mould may have a weight, and therefore a volume, that is slightly variable between one dose and the next. There is thus the risk of obtaining variations in the dimensions of the moulded objects as the weight of the dose varies, which may not be acceptable.<br>
A mould is known for obtaining by compression-moulding a head that is suitable for being joined to a tubular body so as to form a tube for toothpaste or other paste-like substances. The head comprises a frustum-conical portion from which an externally threaded neck extends. The known mould comprises a die suitable for forming the external surface of the frustum-conical portion and the threaded surface of the neck, and a punch cooperating with the die to form the internal surface of the head. The punch and the die are movable in relation to one another between an opening position in which they are arranged at a certain distance from one another to receive a dose of plastics, and a closing position in which they interact to form the head. The die comprises a plurality of sectors that are movable away from one another to disengage from the threaded neck of the head. At the end of the forming phase, after the punch has moved away from the die, the sectors that compose the<br><br>
die move away from one another, disengaging the head, which falls through gravity onto a collecting surface underneath. The ways of falling of the head onto the collecting surface are practically uncontrolled and the heads may get arranged on the collecting surface with different orientations and in undesired positions. It is therefore necessary to provide, downstream of the mould, orientation devices that arrange the heads  in an ordered position in such a way that subsequent control and viewing devices can monitor correctly the quality of the obtained heads.<br>
An object of the invention is to improve the apparatuses and the methods for forming objects, particularly by means of compression- or injection-moulding of plastics. A further object is to provide apparatuses for forming an object that are provided with movable elements for disengaging from the formed object with shorter strokes in relation to the known apparatuses.<br>
A still further object is to provide apparatuses for forming an object that are provided with movable elements for disengaging from the formed object, in which the movable elements can be driven more simply in relation to the known apparatuses.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide apparatuses that are able to form objects provided with good dimensional precision even when they are obtained from doses of variable weight.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide apparatuses and methods that enable the formed objects to be removed from the mould in controlled conditions and to be deposited on a collecting surface in a desired orientation. In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising forming means closable in a direction to form an object, said forming means comprising at least two reciprocally movable elements along respective arched trajectories to disengage from said object, characterised in<br><br>
that said arched trajectories have respective components parallel to said direction.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, an apparatus is obtained in which the movable elements disengage from the formed object, performing relatively limited strokes. For example, if the apparatus comprises a plurality of forming means assembled peripherally on a carousel rotatable around an axis parallel to the aforementioned direction, the arched trajectories of the movable elements can extend around a point arranged in a position relatively far from the object being formed, without causing an unacceptable increase of the radial dimensions of the carousel. This enables the angular shifts of the movable elements to be limited.<br>
Furthermore, the movable elements can start to disengage from the formed object whilst the forming means is opening,, which results in an increase in productivity.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising forming means closable in a direction to define a forming chamber having a portion provided with a transverse dimension extending transversely to said direction and adjacent to a further portion of lesser transverse dimensions in relation to said transverse dimension, said forming means being decomposable into a first part and at least two movable elements in relation to said first part, characterised in that said at least two movable elements are positionable in relation to said first part in such a way that said portion is defined by adjacent zones of said at least two movable elements and of said first part.<br>
Owing to the second aspect of the invention, an apparatus is obtained that is provided with movable elements that can be moved away from one another to disengage from a formed object, performing strokes of limited extent. The transverse dimension of the forming chamber measured transversely to the closing direction of the forming means, which in the<br><br>
particular case of forming preforms is the same as the diameter of the collar, is in fact jointly defined by the movable elements and by the first part of the forming means and as such does not give rise to undercuts on the formed object. To extract from the forming means the portion of forming chamber having such a transverse dimension, it is thus necessary to move away the movable elements from one another by a quantity that is less than the stroke that would be required if the portion were entirely defined by the movable elements, as occurs in RM 2002A000099. In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising forming means partially included in a casing and closable in a direction to form an object, said forming means comprising at least two movable elements that are drivable by moving means along respective trajectories having a transverse component in relation to said direction to disengage from said object, characterised in that said moving means is assembled in said casing.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, an apparatus having a particularly simple structure is obtained. The moving means assembled on the casing of the forming means has limited overall dimensions and can be managed in a simpler manner in relation to the case in which the moving means is totally outside the forming means.<br>
Furthermore, by assembling the moving means in the casing in which the forming means is partially housed, it is possible to move the forming means, together with the movable elements and the corresponding moving means, along a preset path inside the apparatus. In particular, this path may extend across a plurality of carousels, so as to increase the time available for introducing the dose into the forming means.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising first forming means and second forming means suitable for interacting in a closing position to define a chamber for forming a dose of plastics, said second<br><br>
forming means comprising a first member suitable for coming into contact with said first forming means and a second member, characterised in that in said closing position said second member is movable in relation to said first forming means by elastic means to vary the volume of said chamber according to the weight of said dose.<br>
Owing to the fourth aspect of the invention, it is possible to obtain objects provided with high dimensional precision, even when doses of plastics are processed that have even small weight variations.<br>
In a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising forming means and forming and compensator means, suitable for interacting in a direction to define in a closing position a chamber for forming a dose of plastics, said chamber having a maximum longitudinal dimension in said direction, characterised in that said forming and compensator means are positionable in relation to said forming means in such a way as to define a dimension of said chamber in said direction, different from said maximum longitudinal dimension, substantially independent of the weight of said dose.<br>
Owing to the fifth aspect of the invention, it is possible to obtain objects provided with great dimensional precision even when doses of plastics having weight variations have to be processed. The configuration of the forming means and compensators in fact enables the position of an end wall of an object to be formed to be altered without varying the distance between respective active surfaces of the forming means, which determine a thickness of the object. It is thus possible to keep constant the thickness between an object formed in a given pressing cycle and that of a subsequent pressing cycle in zones of these objects in which it is desired to obtain great dimensional precision. In a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising punch means and die means suitable for interacting to form an object, characterised in that it<br><br>
furthermore comprises centring means suitable for engaging<br>
with a portion of said object to support said object when<br>
said punch means and said die means disengage from each<br>
other.<br>
In a seventh aspect of the invention, there is provided a<br>
method comprising forming an object by punch means and die<br>
means, spacing said die means and said punch means away from<br>
said object,  characterised in that, during said spacing,<br>
there is provided supporting said object.<br>
The apparatus and the method according to the sixth and<br>
seventh aspect of the invention enable the object to be kept<br>
in a controlled position whilst the punch means and the die<br>
means disengage from the formed object.  In this way the<br>
formed object is prevented from being released in undesired<br>
positions or falling onto a collecting surface underneath<br>
with unwanted orientations. Any orientation devices arranged<br>
downstream of the punch means or of the die means are<br>
therefore superfluous.<br>

With reference to Figures 1 to 4 there is shown a mould 1 of<br>
an apparatus for forming preforms 4 by compression-moulding<br>
of     a     plastics     material,      for     example<br>
polyethyleneterephthalate (PET). The preforms 4 formed in<br>
the mould 1 can be subsequently used to obtain bottles by<br>
means of blow-moulding.<br>
The apparatus may comprise a plurality of moulds 1 arranged<br>
peripherally on a carousel rotatable around an axis in such<br>
a way that each mould 1 describes a circular trajectory<br>
during  rotation  of  the  carousel.  Along  the  circular<br>
trajectory each mould 1 is placed in an opening position in<br>
which a dose of plastics to be formed is introduced inside<br>
it. Subsequently, the mould 1 is closed by pressure to form<br>
the dose so as to obtain a preform 4, which remains in the<br>
closed  mould  for  a  sufficient  time  to  ensure  its<br>
stabilisation and cooling. The mould 1 is then opened again<br>
to extract the finished preform 4 and a new dose of plastics<br>
to be formed is introduced therein.<br>
The mould 1 comprises forming means closable in a direction<br>
A to form a preform 4 from a dose of plastics in a viscous<br>
liquid state  (more or less viscous).  The forming means<br>
comprises a punch 3 that reproduces the internal shape of<br>
the preform 4 and die means 2 that is decomposable into a<br>
first part 52 in which a recess 5 is obtained and into a<br>
pair of movable elements 7. In the recess 5 a substantially<br>
cylindrical external surface 6 of the preform 4 is shaped,<br><br>
whereas the movable elements 7 form a threaded portion 8 of the preform 4. During the subsequent process of blow-moulding of the preforms 4, the threaded portion 8 does not undergo substantial shape variations.<br>
The die means 2 is movable in relation to the punch 3 in the direction A between a closing position, shown in Figure 1, and an opening position, shown in Figure 3. In the closing position the punch 3 is in contact with the movable elements 7 of the die means 2 along a closing plane n that is transverse in relation to the direction A. In particular, both the movable elements 7 are in the same semispace identified by the closing plane n. Furthermore, the punch 3 is in contact with the movable elements along a first cylindrical surface 50 and a second cylindrical surface 51 that are arranged in an upper region of the punch 3 to ensure the centring of the punch 3 in relation to the movable elements 7 and the closure of the mould 1. Between the punch 3 and the die means 2 a chamber 9 is defined in which the preform 4 is formed.<br>
In the opening position the die means 2 is on the other hand far from the punch 3, so that the preform 4 can be extracted from the mould 1.<br>
The movable elements 7 are reciprocally movable, owing to moving means 53, between a contact position, shown in Figures 1 and 2, in which the movable elements 7 have been brought near to one another, and a disengagement position, shown in Figure 3, in which the movable elements 7 are spaced apart from one another. The moving means 53 is assembled inside a casing 27 in which the first part 52 of the die means 2 is housed and has a structure that will be disclosed in detail below.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 to 4, the moving means 53 comprises two crosspieces 13, each connected to a respective movable element 7 by a pair of columns 12, provided below with respective shanks 10. The columns 12 are movable in motion of translation in the direction A to move the movable<br><br>
elements 7 between a lower position, shown in Figure 1, and an upper position, shown in Figure 2. In the lower position, a coupling surface 18 obtained on each movable element 7 and provided with a substantially frustum-conical shape, engages in a shapingly coupled manner with a complementary coupling surface 19 obtained on the casing 27. In the upper position, the movable elements 7 are spaced away from the casing 27 in such a manner as to disengage the coupling surfaces 18 from the complementary coupling surfaces 19.<br>
Each movable element 7 is driven between the lower position and the upper position by a respective actuator 14, for example of the pneumatic type, from which a stem 15 protrudes on which a head 16 is fitted that engages in a hollow 17 obtained on the crosspiece 13.<br>
Each actuator 14 is assembled on an end of a support element 28 provided with an intermediate portion fixed by a screw 29 to a pivot 11 extending along an axis X , perpendicular to the direction A. On the support element 28, a lever 21 is obtained that extends transversely in relation to the stem 15 in such a way as to give the support element 28 an "L" shape. The lever 21 projects towards the outside of the casing 27 through a passage 30 and is drivable by a driving device of known type that is not shown, for example a cam or a system of the rod/tappet type.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the pivots 11 are rotatably assembled in seats 32 by guide bushes 33. At the ends of each pivot 11 there are fixed respective further bushes 31 that support the shanks 10 of the columns 12. By using each lever 21, it is possible to rotate the support element 28 and the pivot 11 fixed thereto around the axis X. The actuator 14, the pair of columns 12 and the crosspiece 13 associated with the support element 2 8 rotate connected to the pivot 11 to rotate the respective movable element 7 along an arched trajectory having a shift component parallel to the direction A and a further shift component perpendicular to the direction A. This means that, in the embodiment of the<br><br>
Figures 1 to 5 in which the punch 3 and the die means 2 interact in a vertical direction A, each point of the movable elements 7 moves on a vertical plane perpendicular to the rotation axis X of each pivot 11.<br>
The movement of the movable elements 7 along the arched trajectory enables even objects to be extracted from the mould 1 that are provided with external undercuts such as threads on the threaded portion 8 of the preform 4 or a collar 22 provided in the joint zone between the external surface 6 and the threaded portion 8 of the preform 4. To do so, limited rotations of the movable elements 7 are necessary. In fact, the pivots 11 around which the movable elements 7 rotate. can be positioned at a relatively great distance from the movable elements 7 without influencing the radial dimensions of a possible carousel on which the moulds 1 are assembled. This enables the movable elements 7 to move away from one another by the distance required to extract the preforms 4, without, however, performing very large rotations.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the collar 22 is provided with a diameter D that extends transversely in relation to the direction A. In this specific case, the diameter D is the maximum transverse dimension of the preform 4. The collar 22 is formed by adjacent zones of the first part 52 and of the movable elements 7. More in particular, a zone protruding 23 from the first part 5 2 that is projected outside the casing 27 shapes the collar 22 below, whilst a notch 24 obtained in the movable elements 7 forms the remaining surfaces of the collar 22.<br>
This conformation of the movable elements 7 and of the first part 52 enables the stroke of the movable elements 7 that is required to extract the preform 4 from the mould 1 to be reduced. As in fact the surfaces of the mould 1 that shape the collar 2 2 belong to distinct parts that are movable in an independent manner, the collar 22 does not define an undercut on the mould 1.<br><br>
Above the movable elements 7, a ring element 25 is provided that is shown in Figure 1 that is provided below with a frustum-conical surface 54 that is suitable for engaging in a shapingly coupled manner with further frustum-conical surfaces 55 obtained on the movable elements 7. When the frustum-conical surface 54 is in contact with the further frustum-conical surfaces 55, the ring element 25 keeps the movable elements 7 in the contact position, preventing them from moving away from one another.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, shown in Figure 7a, the ring element 25 interferes with the movable elements 7 not only along the frustum-conical surface 54, but also along a cylindrical surface 56 which, when the mould 1 is closed, engages  in  a  shapingly  coupled  manner  with  further cylindrical surfaces 57 obtained on the movable elements 7. The mould 1 furthermore comprises an aligning device, shown in detail  in  Figures  6  and  7,  which ensures  correct positioning in relation to the movable elements 7 in the contact position. The aligning device comprises a pair of rods 34, only one of which is shown in Figures 6 and 7, arranged on opposite sides of the movable elements 7. Each rod 34 extends in a direction that is transverse in relation to the direction A and comprises a first end region 36 associated with a movable element 7 and a second end region 37 associated with the other movable element 7. With each rod 34 a pair of articulated joints 3 5 are furthermore associated in a slidable manner, each of which is assembled on a movable element 7. The first end region 36 and the second end region 3 7 are each provided with a fixing hole 58 by means of which it is possible to connect the first end region 3 6 and the second end region 3 7 to respective arrest elements that are not shown. The arrest elements ensure that the rods 34 do not come out of the articulated joints 35 when the movable elements 7 move from the contact position to the disengagement position.<br><br>
In the disengagement position of the movable elements 7, shown in Figure 7, the articulated joints 35 are arranged near the first end region 3 6 and the second end region 3 7 of each rod 34. When the moving means 53 takes the movable elements 7 to the contact position shown in Figure 6, the articulated joints 35 move towards one another by sliding along the respective rod 34, until they are arranged in a central region of the rod. In this way the movable elements 7 are guided during their movement by the articulated joints 35 and by the rods 34, having the function of ensuring that in the contact position, the movable elements 7 are always arranged in the same corresponding configuration. With the mould 1 cooling means is associated comprising a refrigerant fluid circulating in a cooling circuit so as to reduce the temperature of the preform 4 that has just been formed. In particular, the refrigerant fluid reaches the movable elements 7 by means of conduits obtained inside the columns 12 and communicating with further conduits obtained in the crosspieces 13 . The latter are provided with threaded holes 38, shown in Figure 5, suitable for receiving respective connections for the entry and exit of the refrigerant fluid. As shown in Figure 3, the refrigerant fluid also circulates outside the first part 52 of the die means 2, which is reached through another conduit 59 obtained in a support member 60 arranged inside the casing 27.<br>
During operation, a preform 4 is formed from a dose of plastics during a forming phase in which the die means 2 and the punch 3 are in the closing position, as shown in Figure 1. The movable elements 7 are located in the lower position in which the coupling surfaces 18 are in contact with the complementary coupling surfaces 19 of the casing 27. The frustum-conical surface 54 of the ring element 25 is engaged in a shapingly coupled manner with the further frustum-conical surfaces 55 of the movable elements 7, preventing the latter from moving away from one another transversely to<br><br>
the direction A through the effect of the thrusts generated by the plastics inside the chamber 9.<br>
The mould 1 remains in this configuration even in a subsequent stabilisation and cooling phase, in which the preform 4 is cooled owing to refrigerant fluid circulating in the movable elements 7 and outside the first part 52 of the die means 2.<br>
At the end of this phase, the die means 2 moves downwards in the direction A to move away from the punch 3. The ring element 25 moves fixedly relative to the die means 2 by keeping the movable elements 7 in the contact position. In this position, the movable elements 7 are firmly tightened on the threaded portion of the preform 4, which detaches itself from the punch 3. Subsequently, the ring element 25 stops its stroke, whilst the die means 2 continues to move away from the punch 3 moving in direction A. The further frustum-conical surfaces 55 thus detach themselves from the frustum-conical surface 54 and the ring element 25 stops interacting with the movable elements 7.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, in a subsequent instant, the actuators 14 move the crosspieces 13 upwards in direction A. The columns 12, the shanks 10 of which move in motion of translation inside the further bushes 31, take the movable elements 7 to the upper position in which the coupling surfaces 18 are disengaged from the complementary coupling surfaces 19.<br>
At this point, the levers 21 are rotated around the respective X axes and move the movable elements 7 to the disengagement position in Figure 3, overcoming the force exerted by two traction springs 20, each one of which is arranged transversely to the direction A and is provided with an end connected to a crosspiece 13 and with a further end connected to the other crosspiece 13. In the disengagement position, the movable elements 7, guided by the aligning device, move away from the threaded portion 8. The preform 4 can now be extracted from the recess 5 by<br><br>
means of an extraction device of the known type. The movable elements 7, by moving from the contact position to the disengagement position, cause a small lifting of the preform 4 from the recess 5, which nevertheless does not produce negative effects on the preform 4.<br>
When the preform 4 has been extracted from the recess 5, the levers 21 are released and the traction springs 2 0 return the movable elements 7 to the contact position. At this point, the columns 12, through the action of the force of gravity and/or of the actuators 14, move the movable elements 7 to the lower position and it is possible to start a new forming cycle. During this phase, the aligning device prevents corresponding shifts of the movable elements 7. Compensating means of the known type can be associated with the mould 1 to take into account variations in the weight of successive doses.<br>
The movable elements provided with moving means assembled in the casing that houses the recess 5 define forming units that are particularly suitable not only for being assembled on a rotating carousel, but also for being moved outside the rotating carousel along a path that makes the forming units interact with a plurality of carousels. This path enables the time available to insert the dose inside the die means to be increased.<br>
Furthermore, providing die means comprising movable elements enables the volume of the forming cavity defined by the die means to be increased compared with cases in which the die means comprises only the first part 52 and the movable elements are associated with the punch. For the same dose weight, this enables the risk of parts of the dose exiting from the cavity to be reduced.<br>
In an embodiment that is not shown, the apparatus may comprise a plurality of moulds of the known type disclosed above placed next to one another in a rectilinear arrangement.<br><br>
In a further embodiment that is not shown, each mould can be used to form objects, for example preforms, by injection-moulding. In this case, with each mould an injection conduit is associated to introduce fluid plastics into the mould. In another embodiment that is not shown, the mould 1 comprises more than two movable elements, for example three or four movable elements that are drivable between a contact position and a disengagement position in similar ways to those disclosed previously.<br>
It is furthermore also possible to provide a mould having movable elements included in the die means and further movable elements associated with the punch.<br>
The mould can be provided with fixed die means and with a movable punch to enable the preform 4 to be formed and extracted.<br>
With reference to Figures 8 to 14, there is shown a mould 101 of an apparatus for forming heads 104 for example of tubes of toothpaste, by compression-moulding of plastics. The apparatus may comprise a plurality of- moulds  101, arranged  peripherally  on  a  rotating  carousel  129  as previously disclosed for the apparatus for forming preforms. Each mould 101 is initially located in an opening position, shown in Figure 8, in which a dose 135 of plastics to be formed is introduced therein. The dose 135 can be ring-shaped, as shown in Figure 8, or can be compact, for example sphere-shaped or cylinder-shaped. It is also possible to introduce two or more compact doses into the mould 101 to obtain a head 104.<br>
Subsequently, the mould 101 closes to form the dose 135 so as to obtain a head 104 comprising a substantially frustum-conical side wall 106 and a threaded portion 10 8, which are shown in Figure 11. The head 104 remains inside the closed mould 101 for sufficient time to ensure its forming, stabilisation and cooling. The mould 101 is then opened again to extract the finished head 104 and insert a new dose 135 to be formed.<br><br>
The mould 101 comprises forming means provided with first forming means 102 and second forming means 103 suitable for interacting in a direction A to form the heads 104 - The first forming means 102 comprises die means connected to a fork 113 (better shown in Figure 14) fixed to a first end 123 of a column 112 that is slidable in the direction A inside a hollow support 130. Near a second end of the column 112 opposite the first end 123 a driving element 121 is fixed that is movable inside a cam guide 128 to drive the first forming means 102 in direction A.<br>
The first forming means 102 comprises two movable elements 107 partially surrounded by the fork 113. Each movable element 107 is provided with a forming end 132 having a first forming surface 145 and a second forming surface 146. The first forming surfaces 145 are suitable for shaping the side wall 10 6 externally whereas the second forming surfaces 146 are suitable for shaping the threaded portion 108 of the head 104.<br>
As shown in Figure 13, the forming ends 132 have a circular half-crown plan shape and are joined to one another along a contact plane P that is perpendicular to the plane of Figure 13.<br>
Each movable element 107 furthermore comprises a connecting end 133 opposite the forming end 132 and connected to it by an intermediate portion 167 provided with a substantially rectangular transverse section, as shown in Figure 13. Each connecting end 133 is rotatably connected by a hinge 111 to a support element 110 that is slidable in direction A inside a housing 127, as shown in Figure 8. The connecting ends 133 are provided above with respective frustum-conical coupling surfaces 118 that are suitable for engaging in a shapingly coupled manner with a complementary coupling surface 119 obtained on a protruding end 142 of a locking sleeve 139, as shown in Figure 11. The locking sleeve 139 extends around a longitudinal axis G parallel to the direction A, is movable in motion of translation in the<br><br>
direction A inside the housing 127 and is configured in such a way as to surround the support element 110, which is in turn slidable in relation to the locking sleeve 13 9. The support element 110 comprises a lower portion 147 provided with two diametrically opposite seats 168 and shown in Figure 12. Each seat 168 receives a respective intermediate portion 167 of the corresponding movable element 107, as shown in Figure 13. The lower portion 147 is furthermore peripherally provided with a groove 165 in which the two branches 166 of the fork 113 engage. In this way, the lower portion 147 is connected fixedly relative to the fork 113. Onto the lower portion 147 a bush 170 is screwed, which is shown in Figure 11, which is provided below with a third forming surface 150 arranged transversely to the longitudinal axis G and is suitable for shaping an end surface 158 of the head 104. On the lower portion 147 a plurality of holes 148 is furthermore provided, shown in Figure 11, arranged radially to the longitudinal axis G and hosting respective elastic retractors 149 that are suitable for acting on the movable elements 107 in such a way as to space them apart from one another by moving them from a contact position to a disengagement position. As shown in Figure 14, with the intermediate portion 167 of each movable element 107 a respective stop element 171 is associated that is fitted to the fork 113 and is suitable for preventing the movable elements 107 from moving away from one another, by an excessive amount. If this occurred, the retractors 149 could exit the holes 148. The stop elements 171 comprise threaded elements protruding inside the fork 113 by an adjustable amount.<br>
Inside the lower portion 147 a blind hole 151 is obtained, shown in Figure 9, that extends along the longitudinal axis G and inside which centring means is housed comprising an elastic element 152 and a centring element 161 with a substantially cylindrical shape. The centring element 161 is provided with a protruding portion 116 suitable for engaging<br><br>
in an opening 109 of the head 104 and is movable in motion of translation inside the blind hole 151. An arrest edge 153 obtained on the bush 170 stops the stroke of the centring element 161 when, through the effect of the thrust exerted by the elastic element 152, the protruding portion 116 exits the blind hole 151 by a preset portion. The centring element 161 is distinct from the forming means, i.e. it is not provided with forming surfaces suitable for shaping surfaces of the head 104.<br>
A first spring 140 is interposed between a first projection 141, obtained on the housing 127, and a second projection 143, obtained on the locking sleeve 13 9. The first spring 14 0 exerts a force parallel to the direction A, in such a way as to push the second projection 143 towards an arrest element 144 fixed to the carousel 129, partially projecting the protruding end 142 outside the housing 127. As shown in Figure 8, with the first forming means 102 a second spring 190 and a third spring 191 of Belleville type are furthermore associated that have progressively increasing stiffness and are suitable for being compressed when the second forming means 103 comes into contact with the first forming means 102 and exerts on the latter force directed upwards.<br>
The second forming means 103 comprises a punch 134 and is driven by a piston 114 slidable in the direction A inside a cylindrical support 131 fixed to the carousel 129, as shown in Figure 10. To an upper end of the piston 114 a further housing 154 is fixed inside which a further sleeve 155 is slideably received that is provided with a circumferal projection 117 shown in Figure 11. A further spring 120 pushes the circumfural projection 117 against an arrest edge 136 obtained inside the further housing 154 in such a way as to project a containing wall 124 obtained at an end of the further sleeve 155 outside the further housing 154. Inside the further sleeve 155 the punch 134 is furthermore arranged that is associated with the piston 114.  By protruding<br><br>
outside the further housing 154, the containing wall 124 performs a dual function. Firstly, it enables the forming end 132 to be centred in relation to the punch 134 when the second forming means 103 approaches the first forming means 102. Secondly, the containing wall 124 defines, together with the punch 134, a cavity inside which the dose 135 can be received.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the further sleeve 155 is provided with a fourth forming surface 162 that is suitable for shaping a further end surface 164 of the head 104, opposite the end surface 158.<br>
The punch 134, the first and second forming surfaces 145 and 146 obtained on the movable elements 107, the third forming surface 150 of the bush 170 and the fourth forming surface 162 define in the closing position shown in Figure 9 a chamber 126 inside which the dose 135 is formed. The punch 134 comprises, at its end that is near the piston 114, a flange 15 9 that is provided below with a rest surface 15 6. Elastic means comprising for example a Belleville-type spring 157, interposed between the support surface 156 and a base 172 fixed to the piston 114, pushes the flange 159 against a stop ring 160. In this way, the punch 134 is kept in a position of maximum protrusion outside the housing 154. The elastic means may also comprise a coiled spring, or a gas spring, or another elastic element in place of the Belleville-type spring 157.<br>
The punch 134 is provided with an active end 105, suitable for cooperating with the first forming means 102, comprising a pointed portion 125 suitable for interacting with the protruding portion 116, a first active surface 137 and a second active surface 122 shown in Figure 11. The first active surface 137 is suitable for internally shaping the side wall 10 6 of the head 104, whereas the second active surface 122 is suitable for internally shaping the threaded portion 108.<br><br>
During operation, when the mould 101 is arranged in an opening position shown in Figure 8, a dose 135 is introduced into the mould 101 to be received on the pointed portion 125. If instead of the ring-shaped dose 135 one or more compact doses were used, they could be positioned on the sides of the pointed portion 125. The movable elements 107 are arranged in a contact position in which they are brought near one another and the coupling surfaces 118 engage in a shapingly coupled manner with the complementary coupling surface 119.<br>
The contact position of the movable elements 10 7 is reached when the column 112, moved by the driving element 121, brings the fork 113 and the support element 110' fixed relative to it near to the housing 127. The movable elements 107 assembled on the support element 110 are in turn partially introduced into the locking sleeve 13 9 until they interact with the protruding end 142. At this point the coupling surfaces 118 engage with the complementary coupling surfaces 119, opposing the action of the elastic retractors 149 in such a way as to place the movable elements 107 next to one another and to the lower portion 14 7. In this position the forming ends 132 are in contact with one another and define a forming recess 100.<br>
When the dose 135 has been introduced into the mould 101, the piston 114 drives the second forming means 103 towards the first forming means 102, in the direction A. The further sleeve 155 approaches the movable elements 107 until the fourth forming surface 162 is brought into contact with a stop surface 163 provided on the forming ends 13 2 and shown in Figure 10.<br>
In this position, the stop surface 163 and the fourth forming surface 162 define a closing plane of the mould 101. In this way a maximum longitudinal dimension H of the chamber 126 is thus defined in the direction A, as shown in Figure 9.  The maximum longitudinal dimension H is kept<br><br>
constant  during  the  forming,  stabilisation  and  cooling<br>
phases, as will be better disclosed below.<br>
Subsequently, the forming ends 132 push the further sleeve<br>
155 inside the further housing 154, which further sleeve 155<br>
approaches the stop ring 160, compressing the further spring<br>
120.<br>
Furthermore, the second forming means 103 pushes upwards the<br>
first forming means 102,  compressing in order the first<br>
spring 140, the second spring 190 and the third spring 191.<br>
During this movement, the protruding ends 142 of the locking<br>
sleeve 139 penetrate inside the housing 127. The closing<br>
position shown in Figure 9 is thus reached.<br>
In this position the punch 134, pushed by the piston 114,<br>
engages in the forming recess 100, shaping the dose 13 5. In<br>
the meantime,  the pointed portion 125 comes into contact<br>
with the protruding portion 116 and pushes the centring<br>
element 161 inside the blind hole 151 against the force of<br>
the elastic element 152. In particular, the pointed portion<br>
125 is received inside the bush 170, going beyond the third<br>
forming surface 150.<br>
In the closing position in Figure 9, the punch 134 acts as a<br>
forming and compensating means,  being free  to move  in<br>
relation to the first forming means 102 and to the further<br>
sleeve 155 to define a chamber 126 having a volume that is<br>
variable according to the weight of the dose 13 5.<br>
In particular,  if  into the mould 101  a dose  135  is<br>
introduced having a greater weight than the nominal weight,<br>
the punch 134, under the thrust of the plastics, moves away<br>
from the first forming means 102, increasing the volume of<br>
the chamber 126. In order to do so, the punch 134 recedes<br>
inside the further housing 154, opposing the Belleville-type<br>
spring 15 7.<br>
If,  on  the  other  hand,  a  relatively  small  dose  is<br>
introduced, the punch 134 is pushed inside the housing 154<br>
by a reduced amount, diminishing the volume of the chamber<br>
126.<br><br>
In other words, the position of the punch 134 in relation to the first forming means 102, i.e. the distance between the first active surface 137 and the first forming surface 145, varies according to the weight of the dose 135. On the other hand, the maximum longitudinal dimension H of the chamber 126 is kept constant, being determined by the relative position of the third forming surface 150 and of the fourth forming surface 162, which remains unvaried because the further sleeve 155, the movable elements 107 and the support element 110 act in this phase as a single body. In this way, heads 104 are obtained having a constant height and a side wall 106 thickness that is variable according to the weight of the dose 135.<br>
The dose 135, which is shaped in such a way as to form the head 104, remains inside the chamber 126 for the time necessary for the stabilisation and the cooling of the head 104. During this phase, the first forming means 102 and the second forming means 103 are cooled by a refrigerant fluid circulating inside suitable passage conduits obtained in the mould 101.<br>
Subsequently, by means of the piston 114 the second forming means 103 is disengaged and moved away from the first forming means 102, which continues to support the head 104 owing to the undercuts of the threaded portion 10 8. Whilst the second forming means 103 moves away from the first forming means 102, the pointed portion 125 exits the blind hole 151, making the centring element 161 protrude outside under the thrust of the elastic element 152 and be centred in the opening 109 of the head 104, as shown in Figure 10. For this purpose, the centring element 161 is provided with a diameter that is slightly less than the diameter of the pointed portion 125. This enables the centring element 161 to enter inside the opening 109 although the diameter of the opening 109 diminishes due to the shrinkages that occur in the instants following moulding.<br><br>
Subsequently, the driving element 121 and the cam guide 128 drive the fork 113 in the direction A away from the arrest element 144 in such a way as to disengage the movable elements 107 from the locking sleeve 139. The movable elements 107, pushed by the elastic retractors 149, move away from one another in such a way as to disengage the forming ends 132 from the head 104. In particular, the movable elements 107 describe an arched trajectory having a component parallel to the direction A.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, when the movable elements 107 move away from one another, the head 104 is initially supported by the centring element 161 and subsequently falls through gravity onto a collecting zone that is not shown from which it is removed by known means. The centring element 161 ensures that the head 104 falls in a controlled manner and is arranged in the collecting zone with the opening 109 facing upwards without taking on undesired positions. Furthermore, the centring element 161 enables it to be prevented that the head 104 remains attached to a movable element 107 when the movable elements 107 move away from one another.<br>
At this point the mould 101 is ready for a new forming cycle.<br>
In an embodiment that is not shown of the apparatus disclosed above, it is possible to provide a mould in which, in the closing position, the punch is fixed and the movable elements, the further sleeve and the support element can move fixed relative to one another to perform the compensating action. Furthermore, to take the mould to the closing position, it is also possible to move the first forming means by bringing it near to the punch or simultaneously move both the punch and the first forming means.<br>
Lastly, the direction A can be vertical, as shown in Figures 8 to 11, but also horizontal or tilted.<br><br>
With reference to Figures 15 to 18, there is shown a mould 201 of an apparatus for forming heads 204 of tubes by compression-moulding of plastics, the mould 201 comprising forming means provided with first forming means 202 and second forming means 203 suitable for interacting in a direction A. The apparatus may comprise a plurality of moulds 2 01, arranged peripherally on a rotatable carousel 229, as disclosed previously with reference to Figures 1 to 4.<br>
The mould 201 differs from the mould 101 shown in Figures 8 to 14 by the ways of varying the volume of the chamber in which the plastics are formed according to the weight of plastics to be formed. The differences between the two types of mould will be highlighted below, without again disclosing the parts that they have in common.<br>
As shown in Figure 18, the first forming means 202 comprises two movable elements 207 having respective forming ends 232 that are each provided with a first forming surface 245 and with a second forming surface 246 that are respectively suitable for shaping the external surface of a side wall 2 06 and of a threaded portion 2 08 of the head 204. The movable elements 207 are supported by a support element 210 inside which a through hole 251 is obtained that extends along a longitudinal axis Y parallel to the direction A. Inside the through hole 251 a forming stem 261 is housed that is provided with a compensating end 216 facing the second forming means 203 and with a fixing end 252 connected to a housing 227. On the compensating end 216 an active surface 250 is obtained that is arranged transversely in relation to the longitudinal axis Y and is suitable for forming an end surface 258 of the head 204, as shown in Figures 17 and 18. The active surface 250 surrounds an indentation 265 provided on the forming stem 261. The support element 210, together with the movable elements 207 connected to it, can slide in relation to the forming stem 261.<br><br>
The second forming means 2 03 comprises a punch 234 fixed relative to a piston 214 that enables the punch. 234 to be moved in the direction A. The punch 234 comprises a first forming portion 23 7, suitable for internally shaping the side wall 206 of the head 204 and a second forming portion 222, suitable for internally shaping the threaded portion 2 08 of the head 204. From the second forming portion 222 a pointed portion 2 25 extends that is suitable for engaging in the indentation 265.<br>
The punch 234 is arranged inside a sleeve 255 provided above with a further forming surface 262 suitable for forming a further end surface 264, opposite the end surface 258 of the head 2 04. On the sleeve 255 a containing wall 224 is obtained that is suitable for interacting with the forming ends 232, which extends upwards outside the further forming surface 262.<br>
During operation, a dose 235 of plastics is introduced into the mould 201 arranged in an opening position, as shown in Figure 15. Subsequently, the mould 201 goes to a closing position, shown in Figure 16, in which the first forming means 202 interacts with the second forming means 2 03. The modes of passage from the opening position to the closing position of the mould 2 01 are substantially the same as previously disclosed with reference to Figures 8 and 9. In the closing position, the movable elements 207 engage with the sleeve 255, having their stop surface 2 63 in contact with the further forming surface 262. The sleeve 255, pushed by the movable elements 207, is in contact with a stop surface 266 obtained on the punch 234, overcoming the force exerted by a preloaded spring 220.<br>
In this position, the sleeve 255, the punch 234 and the movable elements 207 act as a single body that interacts with the forming stem 261 to define a chamber 22 6 inside which the dose 235 is shaped. This chamber is provided-with a maximum longitudinal dimension HI parallel to the direction A, as shown in Figure 16.<br><br>
In particular, the sleeve 255, the punch 234 and the movable elements 2 07 can move fixed relative to one another so that the pointed portion 225 approaches the forming stem 261 penetrating inside the indentation 265. Whilst this occurs, the distance between the further forming surface 262 and the active surface 250 of the forming stem 261 progressively decreases, i.e. the maximum longitudinal dimension HI of the chamber 226 progressively decreases.<br>
The degree of penetration of the pointed portion 225 inside the indentation 265 depends on the weight of the dose 235 introduced into the mould 201. In fact, if a dose having a relatively great weight has to be formed, a limited length of the pointed portion 225 engages in the indentation 265, to form a head having a maximum longitudinal dimension HI that is the same as a first value. If, on the other hand, the dose to be formed has a relatively small weight, the pointed portion 225 penetrates more into the indentation 265. In this way a head is obtained having a maximum longitudinal dimension HI the same as a second value that is less in relation to the first value cited above. Nevertheless, in the closing position, the distance between the first forming surfaces 245 and the first forming portion 237 remains substantially constant, which enables heads 204 to be obtained having a side wall 206 with a constant thickness.<br>
In other words, the punch 234, the sleeve 255 and the movable elements 207 act as forming and compensator means that define, together with the forming stem 261, a chamber 22 6 with a volume that is variable with the varying of the weight of the dose 235.<br>
The head 204 remains inside the cavity 226 for the time required for stabilisation and cooling. Subsequently, the second forming means 203 disengages from the first forming means 2 02 whereas the movable elements 207 continue to support the head 204 engaging with the threaded portion 208, as shown in Figure 17.<br><br>
Subsequently, the movable elements 207 are driven in such a way as  to move away from one another along an arched trajectory having a component parallel to the direction A, as shown in Figure 18. The head 204 thus detaches from the first forming means 202 and falls into a collecting zone from which it is subsequently removed in the known manner. A pair of conduits 270 obtained inside the support element 210 enable respective jets of pressurised air to be sent to diametrically opposite portions of the head 104, as shown by the arrows Fl. This enables a more uniform detachment of the head 104 from the movable elements 107 to be obtained. The mould 201 is now ready for a new forming cycle. In an embodiment that is not shown, the volume of the cavity can be modified according to the weight of the dose by moving  the  forming  stem  in  relation  to  the  assembly comprising the sleeve, the punch and the movable elements, which are kept in a fixed position.<br>
Furthermore, to take the mould to the closing position, it is also possible to move the first forming means by bringing it near to the punch, or simultaneously moving both the punch and the first forming means.<br>
Lastly, the direction A may be vertical as shown in Figures 15 to 18, but also horizontal or tilted.<br>
With reference to Figures 19 and 20, there is shown a cap 39 for closing bottles 46 that in particular contain sparkling wine or champagne, inside which very high pressure is generated. The cap 3 9 comprises a closing body 48 provided with a transverse wall 51 from which a side wall 43 extends that assumes a substantially cylindrical configuration when the cap 3 9 is applied to a bottle 46, as shown in Figure 20. The side wall 43 is provided with a plurality of notches 90 and is delimited below by a retaining edge 40, suitable for engaging with an edge portion 41 of the bottle 46. A tamperproof ring 42 is initially connected to the side wall 43 by bridge elements 44, as shown in Figure 19. From the transverse wall 51 a cylindrical portion 45  furthermore<br><br>
extends that is suitable for being introduced into the<br>
bottle 46.<br>
When the cap 3 9 is used, the cylindrical portion 45 is introduced into the bottle 46 whereas the tamperproof ring 42 is pushed in the direction indicated by the arrow M in such a way as to break the bridge elements 44. The tamperproof ring 42 is forced to engage in a circumfural seat 47 obtained on an external surface of the side wall 43, such as to flex said wall and keep it firmly in contact with the edge portion 41 of the bottle 46, as shown in Figure 20. In this way the tamperproof ring 42 ensures that the closing body 48 remains engaged in the edge portion 41 of the bottle 46 even in the presence of particularly high pressure inside the bottle 4 6<br>
With reference to Figures 21 to 26, there is shown a mould 301 of an apparatus for forming caps 3 9 of the type shown in Figure 19 by compression-moulding of plastics, the mould 3 01 comprising forming means provided with first forming means 3 02 and second forming means 3 03 suitable for interacting in a direction A. The apparatus, in a similar manner to what has been disclosed above with reference to Figures 1 to 4, may comprise a plurality of moulds 3 01 arranged peripherally on a rotatable carousel 329.<br>
The mould 301 differs from the mould 101 shown in Figures 8 to 14 and from the mould 201 shown in Figures 15 to 18 because of certain structural elements and operating ways that will be highlighted below whereas the similarities with the previously disclosed moulds will not be disclosed in detail.<br>
As shown in Figure 25, the first forming means 3 02 comprises a pair of movable elements 3 07 having respective forming ends 332 each provided with a first forming surface 345 suitable for externally shaping the side wall 43 of the cap 3 9 and with a stop surface 3 63 suitable for engaging with the second forming means 303. The movable elements 307 are supported by an internally hollow support element 310 that<br><br>
extends along a longitudinal axis Y parallel to the direction A.<br>
The movable elements 3 07 are furthermore provided with respective connecting ends 333 opposite the forming ends 332 and hinged on the support element 310 by respective hinges 311. The movable elements 307 can be moved in a manner that is very similar to what was disclosed with reference to Figures 8 to 14 between a contact position in which the forming ends 332 are in contact with one another and a disengagement position in which the forming ends 332 open to enable a cap 39 to be extracted from the mould 301. Driving elements 321, shown in Figure 21 are also provided that are completely similar to the driving elements 121 shown in Figure 8 and are arranged to move in motion of translation the support element 310 and the movable elements 3 07 that are connected to it in the direction A when the first forming means 3 02 does not interact with the second forming means 3 03.<br>
The support element 310 is provided below with a shaped end 347 arranged to cooperate with the first forming surfaces 345 for internally forming the side wall 43 of the cap 39. The support element 310 is movable in motion of translation inside a locking sleeve 33 9 in turn fitted in a housing 327 fixed to the carousel 329. Between the locking sleeve 33 9 and the housing 32 7 a first spring 340 is provided that keeps the locking sleeve 339 in contact below with an arrest element 344 that is connected to the carousel 32 9. As shown in Figure 21, with the first forming means 3 02 there is furthermore associated a second spring 3 90 and a third spring 3 91 of the Belleville type, having progressively increasing stiffness and which are suitable for being compressed when the second forming means 3 03 comes into contact with the first forming means 3 02 and exerts on it a force directed upwards in the direction A. Inside the support element 310 there is provided a tubular element 309 made fixed relative to the housing 3 27 by a<br><br>
threaded portion 315, as shown in Figure 26. The tubular element 3 09 is provided below with a second forming surface 346 that can interact with the shaped end 347 of the support element 310 to form the cylindrical portion 45 of the cap 39.<br>
The tubular element 3 09 accommodates an ejector 3 61 having a substantially cylindrical shape and extending along the longitudinal axis Y. The ejector 3 61 is movable in motion of translation in relation to the tubular element 309 owing to driving means that is not shown. At a lower end of the ejector 361 a third forming surface 348 is obtained that is suitable for internally shaping a portion of the transverse wall 51 of the cap 39.<br>
The second forming means 303 comprises a forming member 334 provided above with a fourth forming surface 349 suitable for defining the transverse wall 51 of the cap 3 9. The forming member 334 is provided below with an attachment flange 359 connected to a piston 314 suitable for moving the second forming means 3 03 in the direction A.<br>
A sleeve 355 that is coaxial with the forming member 3 34 and is arranged outside it is received in a further housing 3 54 fixed relative to the piston 314. From an upper end zone of the sleeve 355 a containing wall 3 24 extends that is suitable for receiving in a shapingly coupled manner the forming ends 332 in a closing position of the mould 3 01. The containing wall 324 is joined to the sleeve 355 at a further stop surface 370 arranged transversely in relation to the direction A to cooperate with the stop surfaces 3 63 obtained on the movable elements 307.<br>
Inside the sleeve 355 and in the proximity of the containing wall 324 a shaped portion 369 is received that is suitable for interacting with the forming member 334 and with the forming ends 332 of the movable elements 3 07 to form the tamperproof ring 42.<br>
Between the sleeve 355 and the further housing 354 there is provided a further spring 320 that exerts a force that is<br><br>
parallel to the direction A projecting the sleeve 355 partially outside the further housing 354. In particular, the further spring 320 pushes a circumferal projection 317 obtained on the sleeve 355 against an arrest edge 33 6 provided inside the further housing 354.<br>
During operation, the mould 3 01 is initially in an opening position shown in Figure 21 in which the first forming means 302 is spaced away from the second forming means 303. The sleeve 355 is in its maximum excursion position in relation to the further housing 3 54 inasmuch as the further spring 320 pushes the circumferal projection 317 into contact with the arrest edge 33 6. The forming member 334 and the containing wall 324 of the sleeve 355 define a recess 3 05 into which a dose 33 5 of plastics is introduced. The movable elements 3 07 are in the contact position in which the forming ends 332 are in contact with one another. The driving elements 321 position the movable elements 307 in such a way that the stop surface 363 is significantly lower than the lower ends of the tubular element 3 09 and of the ejector 361.<br>
Subsequently, the piston 314 drives the second forming means 3 03 bringing it near the first forming means 302 in the direction A, bringing the further stop surface 370 into contact with the stop surface 363, as shown in Figure 22. Whilst the piston 314 continues to bring the further housing 354 near to the first forming means 3 027 the sleeve 355, the advance of which in the direction A is opposed by the movable elements 307, compresses the further spring 320 until it comes to rest against the attachment flange 359. Under the thrust of the second forming means 3 03, the movable elements 3 07 move upwards, approaching the arrest element 344 in such a way as to substantially align the stop surface 3 63 on the lower ends of the ejector 3 61 and of the tubular element 309. The mould 301 is thus in the closing position in which between the first forming means 3 02 and<br><br>
the second forming means 303 a chamber 326 is defined inside which the dose 335 is shaped to obtain the cap 39. When the cap 3 9 has remained in the chamber 3 26 for sufficient time to stabilise its shape and the temperature has fallen to an acceptable level, the piston 314 moves the second forming means 3 03 away from the first forming means 3 02, as shown in Figure 23. The further spring 3 2 0 pushes the sleeve 355 upwards, which, as it is no longer retained by the movable elements 307, goes to rest against the arrest edge 336. Simultaneously, the driving element 321 moves the movable elements 3 07 away from the housing 3 27 and the driving means brings the ejector 3 61 near to the second forming means 3 03. The tubular element 3 09, which is fixed relative to the housing 327, remains in a retracted position in relation to the movable elements 3 07 and to the ejector 361, partially disengaging from the cylindrical portion 45 of the cap 39, as shown in Figure 24. The driving element 321 continues to move the movable elements 307 away from the housing 327, disengaging the connecting end 333 from the locking sleeve 33 9. At this point the movable elements 3 07 open and go to the disengagement position in Figure 24, whilst the cap 3 9 remains associated with the first forming means 3 02. In fact, the side wall 43 is provided with internal undercuts that engage with the shaped end 347 of the support element 310.<br>
Subsequently, the driving means, which continues to move the ejector 361 towards the second forming means 303, elastically deforms the side wall 43 of the cap 3 9 disengaging it from the shaped end 347, as shown in Figure 25. The cap 39 can now be extracted from the mould 301 and a new forming cycle can start.<br>
The moulds disclosed up to now may operate not only according to compression-moulding techniques in which a dose of plastics is separated from an extruder and introduced into the mould, but also according to injection-moulding<br><br>
techniques in which a fluid plastic material is injected inside a closed mould.<br>
The features disclosed in the disclosure of the Figures with reference to a specific embodiment may also be claimed in relation to any other embodiment disclosed or may also be claimed in their own right.<br><br>
