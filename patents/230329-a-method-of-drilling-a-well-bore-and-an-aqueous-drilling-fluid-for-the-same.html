				<td>USE OF ANIONIC DISPERSION POLYMERS AS VISCOSITY MODIFIERS IN<br>
AQUEOUS DRILLING FLUIDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention concerns aqueous drilling fluids containing anionic polymers.<br>
More particularly, this invention relates to a method increasing the viscosity of<br>
aqueous drilling fluids using anionic dispersion polymers, to aqueous drilling fluids<br>
containing anionic dispersion polymers, and to use of the drilling fluids for drilling a<br>
well bore through a subterranean formation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In drilling wells for the recovery of oil, gas and water from subterranean<br>
formations, a drilling fluid or drilling mud is pumped down through a hollow drill pipe,<br>
across the face of the drill bit, and upward through the drill hole. The drilling mud<br>
serves to cool and lubricate the drill bit, to raise the drilling cutting to the surface and to<br>
seal the sides of the well to prevent loss of water and drilling fluid into the formation<br>
surrounding the drill hole. The drilling mud must have both proper viscosity and some<br>
degree of gelation to carry the drilled solids to the surface, over a screen to remove the<br>
large chips, and to remove sands in a settling basin.<br>
In order to achieve the proper viscosity, various polymeric viscosifying agents<br>
may be added to the drilling fluid. The polymers act to increase the viscosity of the<br>
drilling fluid, thus forming a barrier between the rock formations and the vein of<br>
material being recovered. Polymers also help to increase the slipperiness of the drilling<br>
fluid and drilled ore and to lubricate the waste sludge. Polymers are also useful in the<br>
separation of the water, oil and waste solids after the drilling fluid is recovered from the<br>
well.<br>
Polymeric viscosifiers used to date include latex polymers, where polymer<br>
solids are dispersed in a hydrocarbon solvent and stabilized with surfactants, dry<br>
polymers and solution polymers.<br><br>
Disadvantages associated with latex polymers include the environmental<br>
unfriendliness of hydrocarbons and surfactants in case of spill or discharge on land or<br>
on an off shore platform and the potential fire hazards associated with the hydrocarbon<br>
solvent. Furthermore, environmental regulations in certain countries prohibit the<br>
injection of oil-containing polymers into subterranean formations below a specified<br>
depth. Latex polymers also must be inverted prior to use and the oil in water emulsion<br>
broken, which involves the use of additional surfactants.<br>
Dry polymers are conventionally used drilling operations due to the high<br>
polymer concentration available in this form as compared to latex or solution polymers.<br>
However, dry polymers are typically very difficult to dissolve, requiring significant<br>
energy and water consumption to assure adequate makedown of the dry polymer into an<br>
active dilute form. Also, because of the difficulty associated with dissolution of the dry<br>
polymer, only very dilute solutions, typically less than 0.5 percent polymer product are<br>
prepared, thus significantly increasing water use requirements. In remote drilling<br>
locations both energy and water are often in short supply and require significant<br>
financial input to secure. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for the development of<br>
environmentally friendly, safe and economical viscosity modifiers for drilling fluids.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an aspect, this invention is a method of increasing the viscosity of an aqueous<br>
drilling fluid used in drilling wells through subterranean formations comprising adding<br>
to the drilling fluid an effective viscosity increasing amount of one or more anionic<br>
dispersion polymers, wherein the anionic dispersion polymers are composed of about 2<br>
to about 98 mole percent of one or more anionic monomers and about 98 to about 2<br>
mole percent of one or more nonionic monomers and wherein the anionic dispersion<br>
polymer has a RSV of about 10 to about 50 dL/g.<br>
In another aspect, this invention is an aqueous drilling fluid used in drilling<br>
wells through subterranean formations having a pH of between about 7 and about 12<br>
and a viscosity of from about 20 to about 80 sec (Marsch cone) which is prepared by<br>
admixing fresh water, brine or seawater with about 0.02 lb to about 2.5 lb per barrel,<br><br>
based on polymer actives, of one or more anionic dispersion polymers, wherein the<br>
anionic dispersion polymers are composed of about 2 to about 98 mole percent of one<br>
or more anionic monomers and from about 98 to about 2 mole percent of one or more<br>
nonionic monomers and wherein the anionic dispersion polymers have a RSV of from<br>
about 10 to about 50 dL/g.<br>
In another aspect, this invention is a method of drilling a well bore through a<br>
subterranean formation comprising circulating through the well bore an aqueous<br>
drilling fluid having a pH of between about 7 and about 12 and a viscosity of from<br>
about 20 to about 80 sec (Marsch cone) which is prepared by admixing fresh water,<br>
brine or seawater with about 0.02 lb to about 2.5 lb per barrel, based on polymer<br>
actives, of one or more anionic dispersion polymers, wherein the anionic dispersion<br>
polymers are composed of about 2 to about 98 mole percent of one or more anionic<br>
monomers and from about 98 to about 2 mole percent of one or more nonionic<br>
monomers and wherein the anionic dispersion polymers have a RSV of from about 10<br>
to about 50 dL/g.<br>
The drilling fluid of this invention is prepared using water-based polymer<br>
compositions that contain neither organic solvents or surfactants, thereby resulting in a<br>
treatment system that addresses the environmental, safety and handling and economic<br>
concerns of industries utilizing such drilling processes.<br>
Drilling fluids prepared using the anionic dispersion polymer of this invention<br>
do not flocculate the bentonite in bentonite-containing drilling muds and therefore have<br>
significantly increased useable life compared to bentonite-containing drilling fluids<br>
prepared from dry polymers of similar composition.<br>
Also, when the anionic dispersion polymer of this invention is used to prepare<br>
bentonite-containing drilling muds, less bentonite is required to prepare a drilling mud<br>
having the same lifting characteristics as the corresponding composition prepared using<br>
dry polymers, resulting in increased drill bit life. This allows the end-user to realize<br>
cost savings relating to bentonite as well as the costs associated with less-frequent<br>
replacement of the drill bits.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions of Terms<br>
"Anionic dispersion polymer" means an anionic water-soluble polymer<br>
dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase containing one or more inorganic salts.<br>
Representative examples of dispersion polymerization of water-soluble anionic<br>
monomers in an aqueous continuous phase can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,970;<br>
5,837,776; 5,985,992; and 6,265,477 and PCT Application Number US01/10867,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Dispersion polymers are prepared by combining water, one or more inorganic<br>
salts, one or more water-soluble anionic and nonionic monomers, any polymerization<br>
additives such as chelants, pH buffers or chain transfer agents, and a water-soluble<br>
stabilizer polymer. In addition, further processing, structure modifying and/or<br>
stabilizing agents may be added to the mixture. All or a portion of this mixture is<br>
charged to a reactor equipped with a mixer, thermocouple, nitrogen purging tube, and<br>
water condenser. The solution is mixed vigorously, heated to the desired temperature,<br>
and then a water-soluble initiator is added. The solution is purged with nitrogen while<br>
maintaining temperature and mixing for several hours. During the course of the<br>
reaction, a discontinuous phase containing the water-soluble polymer is formed. A<br>
portion of the reaction mixture containing any combination of the starting materials<br>
may be added in a semi-batch fashion during the course of the polymerization to<br>
improve processing or affect polymer composition or molecular weight. After this<br>
time, the products are cooled to room temperature, and any post-polymerization<br>
additives are charged to the reactor. Water continuous dispersions of water-soluble<br>
polymers are free flowing liquids with product viscosities of about 50 to about 10,000<br>
centipoise (cP), as measured at low shear.<br>
Inorganic salts suitable for preparing the anionic dispersion polymer include<br>
inorganic or organic sulfates, phosphates, chlorides, fluorides, citrates, acetates,<br>
tartrates, hydrogenphosphates or a mixture thereof. Preferred salts include ammonium<br>
sulfate, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, ammonium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium<br><br>
chloride and ammonium chloride. The salts are used in aqueous solution typically<br>
having a combined total concentration of 15 weight percent or above in the product<br>
mixture.<br>
Additional cationic salts may be used alone or in combination with the above<br>
inorganic salts for preparing anionic dispersion polymers. Preferred cationic salts<br>
include tetraalkylammonium halides having from 4 to 22 carbon atoms, substituted<br>
tetraalkylammonium halides having from 4 to 22 carbon atoms, aryl trialkylammonium<br>
halides having from 9 to 22 carbon atoms, and substituted aryl trialkylammonium<br>
halides having from 9 to 22 carbon atoms. Representative preferred cationic salts<br>
include cetylpyridinium chloride, cetylmethylammonium chloride and<br>
benzyltriethylammonium chloride.<br>
Stabilizers used for preparing anionic dispersion polymers typically include<br>
anionically charged water soluble polymers having a molecular weight of from about<br>
10,000 to about 10,000,000 and preferably from about 1,000,000 to about 3,000,000.<br>
The stabilizer polymer must be soluble or slightly soluble in the salt solution, and must<br>
be soluble in water. The stabilizer is used in an amount of from about 1 to about 20%<br>
by weight based on the total weight of the dispersion polymer.<br>
Representative anionic stabilizers include, but are not limited to, polyacrylic<br>
acid, poly(meth)acrylic acid, poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-l-propanesulfonic acid),<br>
copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-l-propanesulfonic acid and an anionic<br>
comonomer selected from acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, polymers of one or more<br>
anionic monomers and one or more nonionic monomers, and the sodium salts of the<br>
aforementioned anionic stablizers.<br>
Nonionic stabilizer or dispersant components can also be used alone or in<br>
combination with the anionic stabilizers described herein for preparing anionic<br>
dispersion polymers. Representative nonionic components include, but are not limited<br>
to polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene, soluble starch,<br>
epichlorohydrin/dimethylamine, poly(N-vinylpyridine), and the like.<br>
Cationic stabilizer or dispersant components can also be used alone or in<br>
combination with the anionic and nonionic stabilizers described herein for preparing<br><br>
anionic dispersion polymers. Suitable cationic stabilizers include, but are not limited<br>
to, poly(diaIIyIdimethylammonium chloride), poly(dimethylaminoethyIacrylate methyl<br>
chloride quaternary salt), acrylamide/ dimethylaminoethyl acrylate benzyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt copolymer and diallyldimethylammonium chloride/ /<br>
dimethylaminoethyl acrylate benzyl chloride quaternary salt copolymer.<br>
A multifunctional alcohol such as glycerin or ethylene glycol may also be<br>
included in the polymerization system. The formation of the fine particles is smoothly<br>
carried out in the presence of these alcohols.<br>
The polymerization reaction is initiated by any means that results in generation<br>
of a suitable free radical. Initiation may be induced through the use of any number of<br>
conventional systems including thermal, photochemical, or redox coupled initiation<br>
systems. Thermally derived radicals, in which the radical species results from thermal,<br>
homolytic dissociation of a water-soluble azo, peroxide, hydroperoxide and perester<br>
compound are preferred. Especially preferred initiators are azo compounds including<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride and 2,2'-azobis(N, N'-<br>
dimethyleneisobutylamine) hydrochloride, and the like.<br>
A seed polymer may be added to the reaction mixture before the initiating<br>
polymerization of the monomers for the purpose of facilitating a fine dispersion of<br>
particles. The seed polymer is a water-soluble polymer insoluble in the aqueous<br>
solution of the polyvalent anionic salt. The monomer composition of the seed polymer<br>
need not be identical to that of the water-soluble polymer formed during<br>
polymerization. The seed polymer is preferably a polymer prepared by the dispersion<br>
polymer process described herein.<br>
Since the dispersion polymers do not contain surfactants or oil, the dispersion<br>
polymers are environmentally friendly. Moreover, the absence of oil in the dispersion<br>
polymers equates to such polymers having virtually zero volatile organic content<br>
(VOC), and dramatically reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD), carbon oxygen<br>
demand (COD) and total organic carbon (COD) compared to conventional inverse<br>
emulsion polymers. This is another environmental advantage of such polymers.<br>
"Anionic monomer" means a monomer as defined herein which possesses a net<br>
negative charge. Representative anionic monomers include (meth)acrylic acid, and it's<br><br>
salts, including, but not limited to acrylic acid, sodium acrylate, ammonium acrylate,<br>
methacrylic acid, sodium methacrylate, and ammonium methacrylate; 2-acrylamido-2-<br>
methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) and its sodium salt; vinyl sulfonic acid and its<br>
salts including sodium vinyl sulfonate; styrene sulfonic acid and its salts; maleic acid<br>
and it's salts, including, but not limited to the sodium salt and ammonium salt;<br>
sulfopropyl acrylate or methacrylate or other water-soluble forms of these or other<br>
polymerisable carboxylic or sulphonic acids; sulfomethylated acrylamide; allyl<br>
sulfonate; itaconic acid, acrylamidomethylbutanoic acid; fumaric acid; vinylphosphonic<br>
acid; allylphosphonic acid, phosphonomethylated acrylamide, and the like.<br>
"(Meth)acrylic acid" means acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a salt thereof.<br>
"(Meth)acrylamide" means acrylamide or methacrylamide.<br>
"Monomer" means a polymerizable allylic, vinylic or acrylic compound. The<br>
monomer may be anionic, cationic or nonionic. Vinyl monomers are preferred, acrylic<br>
monomers are more preferred.<br>
"Nonionic monomer" means a monomer as defined herein which is electrically<br>
neutral. Representative non-ionic, water-soluble monomers include acrylamide,<br>
methacrylamide, N-methylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide,<br>
N-sopropylacrylamide, N-vinylformamide, N-vinylmethylacetamide,<br>
dimethylhydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl<br>
acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, N-t-butylacrylamide, N-<br>
methylolacrylamide, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, 2-ethylhexyI acrylate, and the like.<br>
"RSV" stands for Reduced Specific Viscosity. Within a series of polymer<br>
homologs which are substantially linear and well solvated, "reduced specific viscosity<br>
(RSV)" measurements for dilute polymer solutions are an indication of polymer chain<br>
length and average molecular weight according to Paul J. Flory, in "Principles of<br>
Polymer Chemistry", Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, © 1953, Chapter VH,<br>
"Determination of Molecular Weights ", pp. 266-316. The RSV is measured at a given<br>
polymer concentration and temperature and calculated as follows:<br><br><br><br>
The units of concentration "c" are (grams/100 ml or g/deciliter). Therefore, the units of<br>
RSV are dl/g. In this patent application, a 1.0 molar sodium nitrate solution is used for<br>
measuring RSV. The polymer concentration in this solvent is measured at about 0.045<br>
g/dL. The RSV is measured at 30°C. The viscosities n and n0 are measured using a<br>
Cannon Ubbelohde semimicro dilution viscometer, size 75. The viscometer is mounted<br>
in a perfectly vertical position in a constant temperature bath adjusted to 30 ± 0.02 °C.<br>
The error inherent in the calculation of RSV is about 2 dl/gram. When two polymer<br>
homologs within a series have similar RSV's that is an indication that they have similar<br>
molecular weights.<br>
Preferred Embodiments<br>
Typical dispersions of anionic polymers of this invention have RSV's of from<br>
about 10 to about 50 and contain from about 10 to about 35 percent polymer actives.<br>
The anionic polymers of this invention have a molecular weight of at least about<br>
100,000, where the upper limit of the molecular weight is limited only by the solubility<br>
of the polymer in the drilling fluid. Preferred anionic polymers have a molecular<br>
weight of at least one million and more preferred polymers have a molecular weight of<br>
at least five million.<br>
In a preferred aspect of this invention, the anionic dispersion polymer is<br>
composed of one or more anionic monomers and one or more nonionic monomers are<br>
selected from the group consisting of acrylamide and methacrylamide.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the anionic monomers are selected from the group<br>
consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic<br>
acid and the salts thereof.<br>
In another preferred aspect, die dispersion polymer is acrylamide/acrylic acid<br>
copolymer.<br><br>
In another preferred aspect, the dispersion polymer is composed of from about 2<br>
to about 50 mole percent acrylic acid.<br>
A drilling fluid according to this invention typically is composed of fresh water,<br>
brine or seawater and from about 0.02 lb to about 2.5 lb per barrel, preferably from<br>
about 0.12 lb to about 0.5 lb per barrel, based on polymer actives, of anionic dispersion<br>
polymer.<br>
The aqueous drilling fluid preferably contains up to 10 percent by weight,<br>
preferably up to 5 percent and more preferably 4-5 percent by weight of clay.<br>
Preferred clays include smectite clays such as montmorillonites (bentonite), as<br>
well as mixed layer types, attapulgite and sepiplite.<br>
However, it is known that addition of acrylamide/acrylic acid polymers to<br>
/rontonite-containing drilling muds can result in an initial rise in viscosity, followed by<br>
a subsequent drop in viscosity when additional polymer is added as a result of<br>
flocculation of the bentonite and native clays present in the formation. This<br>
flocculation can result in an increase in the gel strength of the fluid to such an extent as<br>
to not permit proper settling of bit cuttings, thereby reducing the effective life of the<br>
drilling fluid. This increase in gel strength has been compensated for to some extent by<br>
the addition of additional thinning agents such as caustic and quebracho and complex<br>
lignosulfates.<br>
We have discovered that bentomte-conlaining drilling fluids prepared using<br>
anionic dispersion polymers do not flocculate the bentonite and therefore have<br>
significantly increased useable life compared to bentonite-containing drilling fluids<br>
prepared from dry polymers of similar composition while requiring reduced levels of<br>
thinning agents and the like.<br>
We have also discovered that using anionic dispersion polymers permits the<br>
preparation of drilling fluids that require less bentonite than required to make a drilling<br>
fluid having the same lifting characteristics as the corresponding composition prepared<br>
using dry polymers. Reducing the amount of solids such as bentonite in the drilling<br>
mud results in increased drill bit life which in turn results in savings in the cost of the<br>
bits and further savings in labor to replace the bits since it is unnecessary to change bits<br><br>
so often. Reducing the amount of bentonite in the drilling fluid results in additional<br>
savings.<br>
Drilling fluids of this invention have a pH of between about 7 and about 12,<br>
preferably between about 8.5 and about 10 and a viscosity of from about 20 to about 80<br>
sec, preferably from about 40 to about 50 sec (Marsch cone).<br>
The aqueous drilling fluid may contain other conventional additives including<br>
electrolytes, pH adjusting agents, lubricants, bactericides, breakers, iron control agents,<br>
foaming agents such as surfactants, gases or liquified gases, proppants, thinners,<br>
viscosifiers such as starch, modified starch, xanthan gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose<br>
polymer, and the like, weighting agents such as barites and haematite, and inorganic<br>
salts which aid in shale inhibition including sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
calcium chloride, potassium carbonate, sodium acetate, calcium sulphate, and the like.<br>
The drilling fluid is prepared by admixing the anionic dispersion polymer and<br>
any additional conventional drilling fluid additives in fresh water, brine or seawater.<br>
The anionic dispersion polymer may be added directly to the drilling fluid, or<br>
preferably is diluted with fresh water, brine or seawater to a concentration of from<br>
about 0.02 lb to about 2.5 lb per barrel, preferably from about 0.12 lb to about 0.5 lb per<br>
barrel, based on polymer actives, prior to admixing with the drilling fluid. Because of<br>
the ease of handling and rapid dissolution of the polymer compared to a dry polymer<br>
product, makedown is accomplished quickly, reducing equipment and manpower costs<br>
associated with preparation of the drilling fluid. The rapid dissolution of the anionic<br>
dispersion polymer also facilitates incremental changes in the viscosity of the drilling<br>
fluid, which may be required by the nature of the particular drilling operation.<br>
Use of the anionic dispersion polymers described herein also permits a<br>
substantial reduction in water consumption compared to the use of dry anionic polymer<br>
products, permitting the preparation of drilling fluids having a polymer concentration of<br>
up to 2.5 lb per barrel, based on polymer solids, while still affording an easily handled<br>
product.<br>
The aqueous drilling fluid described herein may be used in any conventional<br>
drilling process in the same way as known aqueous drilling fluids. For example, in a<br>
typical drilling operation, drilling fluids are pumped down a hollow drill string, through<br><br>
nozzles in the bit at the bottom of the well, and back up the annulus formed by the hole<br>
or casing and drill string to the surface. Once reaching the surface, the drilling fluid is<br>
passed through a series of vibrating screens, settling tanks, hydrocyclones and<br>
centrifuges to remove formation debris brought to the surface. It is thereafter treated<br>
with additives to obtain the desired set of properties; pumped back into the well and the<br>
cycle is repeated.<br>
The drilling fluid can be formulated in advance of actual drilling or<br>
alternatively, the anionic dispersion polymer can be added to the drilling fluid of a well<br>
in progress by injection into the mud circulation system at any one or more of several<br>
points, including, for example, the mud pump suction, hopper, mud suction pit, return<br>
line (prior to the drill solids removal system), the drill pipe, and the like.<br>
The drilling fluid should be monitored by regular sampling and analysis to<br>
maintain an adequate concentration of polymer.<br>
The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following examples,<br>
which are presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope<br>
of this invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A 22.7% polymer solids, 70/30-mole percent acrylamide/ acrylic dispersion<br>
polymer is synthesized in the following manner.<br>
A 1500cc reaction flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple,<br>
condenser, nitrogen purge tube, an addition port and heating tape. To this reaction flask<br>
is added a solution prepared by combining 356.6 g of deionized water, 64 g sodium<br>
sulfate, 84 g ammonium sulfate, 2.8 g sodium formate, 85.0 g of a 16 % aqueous<br>
solution of an anionic stabilizer polymer (available from Ondeo Nalco Company,<br>
Naperville, IL) 329.6 g of a 48.4 % aqueous solution of acrylamide (available from<br>
Ondeo Nalco Company), 0.40 g of the tetrasodium salt of ethylene diamine tetracetic<br>
acid, 69.30 g acrylic acid (available from Rohm and Haas Texas, Inc., Deer Park, TX),<br>
and 4.0 g of a 50 % aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The monomer reaction<br>
solution is heated to 35 °C with thorough mixing. To the homogenous monomer<br>
reaction solution is added 1.0 g of a 1 % aqueous solution of VA044 (2,2'-Azobis (N,<br><br>
N'-dimethyleaeisobutyramidine) dihydrochloride, available from Wako Chemicals<br>
USA, Inc., Richmond, VA). The polymerization is carried out under N2 atmosphere at<br>
35 °C with thorough mixing. After a total reaction time of 6 hours, 2.0 g of a 1 %<br>
aqueous solution of VA044 is added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is<br>
kept at 35 °C overnight. The next day, 2.0 g of a 10 % aqueous solution of VA044 is<br>
added, and the reaction temperature is maintained for another 2 hours before the<br>
reaction mixture is cooled and removed from the reactor. The product of this reaction<br>
is a milky white liquid (700 cp., RSV of 33.7 dl/g).<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of a Representative Drilling Fluid<br>
The polymer of Example 1 is added to water in a dilution tank using a Venturi<br>
pump to obtain a polymer concentration of 0.33 lb. per barrel, based on polymer<br>
actives. The dilution tank is equipped with a mixer to agitate the solution. After the<br>
polymer solution is prepared, bentonite clay, 10 lb. per barrel, is added to the polymer<br>
solution to form the drilling fluid.<br>
A comparison of the drilling fluid prepared above with a drilling fluid prepared<br>
from a dry anionic polymer of similar composition in a southern European water<br>
drilling operation shows that the drilling fluid of this invention does not flocculate<br>
bentonite and has a substantially increased useful life compared to a drilling fluid<br>
prepared using the corresponding dry polymer.<br>
Although this invention has been described in detail for the purpose of<br>
illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that<br>
numerous modifications, alterations and changes can be made therein by those skilled<br>
in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention except as it may<br>
be limited by the claims. All changes which come within the meaning and range of<br>
equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.<br><br>
