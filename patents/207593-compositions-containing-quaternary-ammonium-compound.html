TITLE<br>
A process of preparing a surfactant composition containing quaternary<br>
ammonium compound"<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Galaxy Surfactants Limited<br>
C-49/2, TTC Industrial Area, Pawne, Navi-Mumbai 400 703, Maharashtra, India.<br>
A Public Limited Company Registered under Company's Act -1956<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
" A process of preparing a surfactant composition of the formula containing<br>
quaternary ammonium compound"<br><br>
Where in<br>
R1 is a molecule aliphatic, aromatic, hetrocyclic substituted or unsubstituted saturated or unsaturated entities attached to functional groups like acid chloride or carboxyl or group capable of giving amide. R2, R3 can be C1 to C3 alkyl group,<br>
•	R1 &amp; R4 can be Aliphatic alkyl (C2 to C22) or aromatic. They can be same or different.<br>
•	R4 can be RCOO", mineral acid like CI", PO4", phenolic OH , Cinnamic etc.<br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to usage of quaternary ammonium compounds. This relates &amp; not limited to usage for multi functional quaternary ammonium compound formulations. Examples of reduced Zein values signifying reduced irritancy, thus more skin friendly molecules, having anti bactericidal, cleaning &amp; wetting property in one molecule, thus unique usage for as surface cleaners. Having conditioning &amp; cleaning properties in a same molecule for personal care. Boosting foam as well as viscosity in surfactant systems used for personal care formulations. Other usage including detergent and cleaning formulations are also unique.<br>
1<br><br>
Back ground of the invention :<br>
Quaternary ammonium compound have been use since long time. The positive Nitrogen also imparts many useful properties to the compound. Few of them are substantivity on skin, cloth, hair etc. Antibacterial &amp; anti fungal properties.<br>
These quaternary compounds are manufactured by different chemical routes well evaluated in prior art.<br>
An ethoxylation in aqueous media is one of such route used since many years. Surprisingly we have invented a method to modify these molecule further which will impart more useful properties apart from the conventional properties of quaternary compounds.<br>
Present invention pertains to salts of quaternary ammonium compounds with various acids, aromatic as well as short chain &amp; long chain fatty acids. This imparts the molecule duel functionality . The molecule will have at least one linear fatty chain or an aromatic chain This chain may be attached to the quaternary nitrogen covalently or ionically, thus imparting many more important properties to the molecule.<br>
The basic quaternary ammonium nitrogen can be ionically attached with another fatty alky acids or aromatic acid or mineral acid group by netralisation process using corresponding carboxylic a acid.<br>
This salt can be used suitably for different applications such as sun protection cosmetic formulations, cleaning, disinfecting formulations. The corresponding molecule can be introduced prior to quarternisation or after the quatemisation depending up on the application /intended use of the molecule.<br>
Rutzeb Horst &amp; others in WO 8909204 A 1 1989, used the ethoxylation process to make a quaternary compound with one or two long chain alkyl residues covalently bonded with nitrogen atom of quaternary compound. The invention also quotes its usage as fabric softener.<br>
The similar compound preparation have been reported earlier for use in softening textiles (CA:111/19996704 K), but not for usage indicated in this invention.<br>
2<br><br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
The inventors of the present patent further this art by introducing, alkyt or aromatic chain or acid radical (anion) in the molecule using strong basisity of the quaternary ammonium compound. This technique enhance the functional properties of the molecule several time over. Thus the present invention pertains to " usage of quaternary ammonium base salts in wide range of applications" as illustrated in example. The application include usage of compounds of invention as antibacterial, anti fungal, wetting agent, cleaning agent, foam booster, viscosity booster. Irritancy reducer etc.<br>
Summery of the invention:<br>
New set of quaternary ammonium compounds is made. In process, the scope for using the compound for multi tasking has increased. The same compound can be used as say sunscreen as well as surfactant function or sunscreen &amp; conditioning purpose has been proposed. The usage as more effective viscosity booster for AOS based liquid formulation is also proposed. Formulation data of bath soap, shampoo and floor cleaner is also presented.<br>

Multi functional performance of the invention:<br>
Compounds of inventions have been used for skin care formulations (Soaps) &amp; hair care formulations. The data as given below shows the superior multifunctional properties of the compound of invention when compared to conventional products used in trade for skin / hair care formulations.<br>
The basic shampoo formulations has been made with 15% active anion surfactants such as Sodium lauryl sulphate, Sodium lauryl ether sulphate and alpha olefin sulphonate with 2% foam / viscosity booster (Cocomonoethanol amide ). The pH of the formulation was adjusted to 6.5 and then Sodium chloride was used as viscosity built up aid in the formulation.<br>
The performance was tested in terms of foaming power, salt required to built up certain viscosity and irritancy  factor in terms of Zein value in a given formulation. For illustration compound of example 10 was used<br>
9<br><br><br>
Conclusion of data : More foam boosting of the formulation as against conventional foam boosters. The usage also reduces Zein value, indicating the formulation become more skin friendlier &amp; thus more safer. Lower salt usage reduces a non contributing compound like sodium chloride in the formulation.<br>
10<br><br>
Hard surface cleaning formulations:<br>
A formulation is made containing 5.5% of active solution of example 19. No other surfactants was used in this test formulation. The diluted solutions were tested for effect on different strains of bacteria and it was seen that the compound 19 is more effective than the commercial disinfectant formulations used for the comparison. It is also needs to be noted that the test formulation does not contain any other ingredient unlike commercial market sample taken for experiments.<br>
Thus it can be seen that in liquid surfactant blends like shampoo, floor<br>
cleaners, the compound of invention gives enhancement in more than<br>
one properties unlike the conventional chemicals used in trade.	<br><br>
Thus even after increase in inoculumn the test compound was found to be more effective.<br>
Methods of analysis:<br>
Foaming : Foaming is done using Ross Miles column as prescribed in BIS 5785:1970<br>
pH : pH of 5% solution is measured using pH meter. The solution is made in distilled water.<br>
11<br><br>
Viscosity: Viscosity was measured using Brook Field Viscometer model LVT.<br>
Zein value: A known weight of Zein is shaken with an aqueous solution of surfactant system, The amount of Zein solubilised is determined gravimetrically.<br>
