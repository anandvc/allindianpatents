				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to screwless pushbar lampholder. More particularly this invention relates to the lampholder which has in built screwless terminals. The embodiment of the invention resides in the inbuilt screwless main terminal &amp; earth terminal &amp; earth terminal in the same insert. The principal object of this invention is to provide a lampholder which has in built screwless main terminals as well as earth terminal in the same insert so as to ease the fixation of respective wire into the terminals.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, the screwless pushbar lampholder having live and neutral terminals are known conventionally. The lampholder having earthing connection on the body of the shell is conventional especially in case of metallic bodies which are fixed with the help of screws.<br>
3.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the above-described problems, it is an objective of the present invention to provide Safety and convenience while handling lampholder. An improved screwless pushbar lampholder wherein a unique screwless terminal is designed with integrated screwless earth terminal housed in the body of the insert, suitable for bom stranded and solid conductor. Electrical contacts from screwless terminals (Live and Neutral) were aimed through a pair of springs, a pair of plunger pipes and a pair of small collar pipes. The spring rests on the screwless terminals specially designed to provide electrical contact through brass/allied material, whereas the holding/gripping of the conductor in the screwless terminals were through resilient materials like spring steel and the like. The screwless terminals are housed in pockets of the insert with suitable retention device for retaining the screwless terminals in position.<br>
To overcome the drawbacks in the existing pushbar lampholders, in the Subject screwless pushbar lampholder, the screwless terminals are housed in specially configured pockets of the body of lampholder insert. The screwless terminals (Live and Neutral) are retained by<br>
two projected legs from the cover as well as by the projection of the longslide, that makes and breaks of the switching operation.<br>
In the subject invention the electrical contacts from the Live &amp; Neutral screwless terminals are made through two small pipes which are housed in the specially made pocket on the long slide, through two long coiled springs which are positioned on the small pipes and remain pressed by two plunger pipes retained in the cover.<br>
In the "OFF" position a pair of collar pipes, spring and the plunger pipe-assembly are positioned on the insulation part of the insert body and in the "ON" position, the long slide/switch moves over the body of Insert, carrying alongwith it the two small pipes on to the screwless terminals, top faces constantly keeping contacts with the pair of plunger pipes through the pair of compressed coil springs.<br>
The body of the insert has special means for retaining/preventing the conductor becoming work loose by means of U-type elongations at the back of the body of the insert. The conductors are released from the screwless terminals with putting little pressure by means of small pointed pin. The body of insert is also provided with cord grips for the Live &amp; Neutral conductor wires.<br>
A special Screwless earth Terminal is in-built in the insert, thereby making it convenient for wiring of Line, Neutral and earth terminal in the same insert, saving much labour in wiring operation.<br>
The required creepage and the clearance, within the restricted space available in the pushbar insert body is maintained without sacrificing efficiency of the switching operation, which is another embodiment of the subject invention.<br>
In the Screwless Earth Terminal there are means for contacting with the Dome of the lampholder through front, rear and top of the dome's U-cut-Surfaces, to ensure adequate conductivity for the earth contact.<br>
The said Insert fitted with the Screwless Earth Terminal when assembled with the dome, the earth terminal grippes the front, rear and top of the U-cut surfaces of the dome, making electrical contacts. Finally when the union Ring is tightened in assembling the lamp holder, the screwless earth terminal makes positive electrical contacts with the dome U-cut surrounding surfaces, thus ensuring adequate electrical earth conductivity/continuity as per standard.<br>
In this special design of the screwless Earth Terminal, contacts with the dome surface has been ensured through brass/copper bearing material with adequate resilience. At the same time gripping of both solid/ stranded conductors are done through resilient material like spring steel. To ensure proper earth continuity, the back up support to the brass /copper bearing strip is provided with an extension of the spring steel.<br>
The embodiment of the invention resides in the design of the Earth Terminal, assembled by riveting, having means for diagonal support to the spring steel clamping strip so as to provide adequate gripping of the conductor with small movement of the conductor insertion into screwless earth terminal. The terminal has provision for self retention into the specially designed pocket of insert body through a projection spring thereby making it possible for removing the earth terminal from the pocket if required.<br>
A suitable means for releasing/removing the earth terminal is provided in the body of the insert. There is also a means in the body for releasing the conductor from the earth terminal.<br>
The surface of the body of the insert is provided with markings for connecting the Live, Neutral &amp; Earth Terminals. The screwless earth terminal which is push-in type can be easily inserted in the insert body thus providing means for adequate earth contact/continuity with the metal part of the lampholder.<br>
The embodiment of the invention resides in the provisions for optional safety Lampholder.<br>
Thus, the invention provides screwless Pushbar Lampholder with integrated screwless earth terminals, wherein the insert comprises a pair of springs having one end housed in the pair of plungers guide holes and the other end in the pair of collar pipe through holes of the<br>
longslide. The said pair of guide holes are provided on the switch slide to hold the collar pipe. A pair of pillar is provided on the inner portion of the cover of the insert. The said switch slide is marked at both the ends to indicate its position. A pair of terminals with one edge angle and open are placed in the body of the said insert. The wire insertion and de-mounting holes are provided at the outer portion of the body of the insert for fixing wire. Three protrusions are provided on the outer portion of the body in the insert, which get fixed in the three slots positioned on the cover of the said insert. The two main terminals and one earth terminal are housed in the cavities of the body. The de-mounting holes are provided near the insertion/fixation holes located at the outer portion of body of the insert. Thus terminals are built in the body of the insert itself.<br>
