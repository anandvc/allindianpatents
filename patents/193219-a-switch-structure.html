Background of the Invention Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a switch structure and more particularly to such a structure enabling a switch, such as a push-button switch, to be connected to spaced contact blades, for example bus bars formed on an insulated base<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the past, in order to connect a switch with a circuit on an insulated base, the switch and circuit were connected by inserting the female connector of a lead wire, of which one end was soldered to the circuit on the insulated base, onto a lead plate of a switch attached to an attached body such as a panel. In the switch connecting structure of the prior art as described above, the number of work processes was large due to having a process in which the switch is mounted to the attached body, and a process in which the female connector connected with the lead of said switch is soldered to an insulated base by means of a lead wire. This resulted in the problems of requiring additional time for assembly as well as contributing to increased labour costs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, it would be desirable to be able to provide a switch connecting structure that is able to shorten work time and lower labour costs by enabling a switch to be directly attached to a bus bar formed on an insulated base<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a switch structure for connection to a pair of spaced contact blades, the structure comprising an electrical<br><br>
3<br>
switch having a housing from which extends an operating member, and a resilient, electrically conductive contact plate slidable in the housing between a rest position and a displaced position on movement of the operating member, and a pair of insertion holes formed within the housing, the structure being provided with a pair of connection terminals each having a terminal plate within the housing resiliently retained in an associated insertion hole in the housing to extend into the path of movement of the contact plate between its rest position and its displaced position, and, integral with the terminal plate, a resilient clamp to fit resiliently onto an associated one of the contact blades, whereby, in the event of movement of the contact plate to its displaced position, said contact plate is caused to engage the terminal plates and to effect electrical continuity between the contact blades.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the resilient clamps are arranged in said connection terminals to be juxtaposed about the housing wall by means of a coupling between said terminal plates, while further recesses for containing said resilient clamps may be formed in said housing<br>
The terminal plates and the resilient clamps may be formed linearly in said connection terminals.<br>
Alternatively, the terminal plates and the resilient clamps may be bent into an offset shape by means of a coupling in said connection terminals.<br>
By way of examples only, embodiments of the invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings of which<br>

Fig. 9 is an exploded perspective view showing the assembled state of the above Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The following provides an explanation of the form of one<br><br>
5<br>
embodiment of the switch connecting structure as claimed in the present invention with reference to Fig 1 through Fig 4 .<br>
In the drawings, reference numeral 1 indicates a switch such as a push-button switch, seesaw switch or slide switch, and as shown in Figs 3 and 4, indicates a push-button switch in this embodiment<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of switch 1. Reference numeral 11 indicates a bottomed housing, projection l1b projects toward the inside from the centre of bottom lla, and together with mutually facing insertion holes l1c being formed, recesses l1d are formed in a portion of the wall Surface that composes each insertion hole l1c. Moreover, grooves l1e, which are continuous with said insertion holes l1c and into which terminals 31 of connection terminals 3 to be described later are engaged, are formed in the inside wall of housing 11.<br>
 Reference numeral 12 indicates a spring of which one end is inserted onto the above-mentioned projection l1b Reference numeral 13 is a pushing lever in which the other end of spring 12 is inserted into hole 13a, and protrudes from througr nole 14a of cover plate 14 fixed on the open end of said housing 11 Reference numeral 15 is an resilient contact plate bent roughly into the shape of the letter "U" that is attached to the above-mentioned pushing level 13, both ends of which have contacts 15a formed into a curved shape<br>
Reference numeral 2 indicates a pair of bus bars attached to an insulated base and so forth in a chassis (not shown) and fized in an insulated state, the ends of which are bent at<br><br>
6<br>
right angles to form blade terminals 21 Reference numeral 3 indicates connection terminals that are inserted into insertion holes l1c of the above-mentioned switch 1, and are composed of terminals 31 that fit into grooves l1e, resilient clamps 32 that fit into and are connected to blade terminals 21 of the above-mentioned bus bars 2, and couplings 33 that connect said terminals 31 and resilient clamps 32.<br>
Tabs 31a are formed in the above-mentioned terminal plates 31 that engage with recesses l1d formed an the above-mentioned housing 11 In addition, the above-mentioned resilient clamps 3 2 are in the form of eyeglass-shaped terminals 3 2a bent towards the inside into a curved shape on the right and left sides. Blade terminals 21 enter inside terminals 32a are clamped in position. When terminals 31 of connection terminals 3 composed in the above-mentioned manner are inserted into insertion holes l1c of housing 11 in switch 1 in advance, and the ends of said terminal plates 31 make contact with the ends of grooves l1e, said connection terminals are locked in position due to tabs 31a of terminals 31 entering recesses l1d In this state, resilient clamps 32 are fixed along the outer surface of housing 11 with couplings 3 3 bend into the shape of the letter "U" in between.<br>
As a result of connection terminals 3 being attached in this manner, switch 1 is fixed to bus bars 2 by inserting terminals 32a of resilient clamps 32 onto plate terminals 21 of bus bars 2 fixed on an insulated base and so forth. At the time of this insertion, the interval between blade terminals 2 1 is naturally arranged to be equal to the interval between<br><br>
7<br>
resilient clamps 32<br>
Next, the following provides an explanation of the operation of the above-mentioned switch 1 In Fig 3, pushing lever 13 is pushed up by the spring force of spring 12 and is stopped as a result of ledge 13b of said pushing lever 13 making contact with cover plate 14 Thus, since contacts 15a of resilient contact plate 15 are positioned away from terminals 31 of connection terminals 3 xn this state, the space between the pair of bus bars 2 is electrically off.<br>
In the above-mentioned state, when pushing lever 13 is pushed down in opposition to the spring force of spring 12, contact plate 15 lowers as shown in Fig. 4 causing contacts 15a to make contact with terminals 31 Consequently/ the space between the pair of bus bars 2 is electrically on. If this type of switch 1 was to be installed, for example, on the chassis of an automobile with the door closed, switch 1 would enter the on state when the door was opened<br>
Furthermore, although the switch shown in the drawings only enters the on state when pushing lever 13 is pushed, it can be made into a locking push-button switch by incorporating a known locking mechanism If this type of locking push-button switch 1 was to be used as, for example, a switch for turning on and off the interior lamp unit installed on the roof of an automobile interior, it could be used to turn the interior lamp on and off. Furthermore, although blade terminals 21 of bus bars 2 are shown to be inserted and from the bottom of housing 11 in switch in the above-mentioned embodiment, switch 1 and bus bars 2 may also be connected by inserting from the side of<br><br>
8<br>
pushing lever 13 as shown in Fig. 5<br>
Although resilient clamps 3 2 are positioned along the outside of housing 11 in the above-mentioned embodiment, the ends of the switch can be prevented from being exposed by increasing the width in the horizontal direction of housing 11 (to the left and right in Figs 3 and 4), forming holes to contain resilient clamps 32 in the widened portion, and containing resilient clamps 32 in these holes.<br>
In addition, Figs 6 and 7 indicate another embodiment of the present invention. In contrast to the above-mentioned two embodiments having terminals 31 and resilient clamps 32 bent in the same direction with coupling 3 3 in between, in the present embodiment, terminals 31 and resilient clamps 32 are arranged linearly with No.Shown-fig.6&amp;7. In addition, in this embodiment, ribs llf are formed on a portion of the outside of housing 11, and a portion of resilient clamps 3 2 are able to be placed on these ribs llf.<br>
When resilient clamps 32 are placed on the above-mentioned ribs llf in this manner, resilient clamps 3 2, which protrude from housing 11, are fixed in a stable state Moreover, this enables the switch to be used even in locations in which the interval between blade terminals 21 of bus bars 2 and housing 11 is long, or housing 11 and bus bars 2 are in such close proximity that they cannot be attached.<br>
Figs 8 and 9 further indicate another embodiment of the present invention In contrast to the above-mentioned embodiment shown in Figs. 6 and 7 having terminals 31 and resilient clamps 32 formed linearly", in the present embodiment",<br><br>
9<br>
couplings 3 3 are bent at a right angle causing terminals 31 and resilient clamps 32 to be offset from each other. In this case, since couplings 33 are placed on the upper surface of housing 11 and second resilient clamps 3 2 are placed on<br>
extensions, switch 1 can be fixed to bus bars 2 in a stable<br>
state even without ribs llf as in the previous embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, regardless of the shape of connection<br>
terminals 3 in each of the above-mentioned embodiments, what is<br><br>
important is that terminal 31 and resilient clamp 32 be formed on one connection terminal 3, so that terminals 31a are inserted into housing 11 and serve as switch contacts, and terminals 32a of resilient clamps 3 2 engage and are clamped in blade terminals 21 of bus bars 2.<br>
As has been described above, since the present invention forms insertion holes in a switch provided with a resilient contact plate that slides by operating an operating lever such as a pushing lever that protrudes from a housing, fits terminal plates through said insertion holes within the range over which said resilient contact plate slides, and resiliently engages and clamps resilient clamps formed into a single unit with these terminals plates in blade terminals of bus blades, connection of the switch and the bus bars can be performed without the use of a connecting means such as welding, thus simplifying the work process since the work time required for connecting the two components is shortened and the two components can be disconnected easily<br>
In addition, by forming terminal plates and resilient clamps linearly, the interval between the bus bars and switch<br><br>
10<br>
can be increased thus enabling variation to be obtained in the manner in which the state is attached Moreover, by bending the couplings to offset the terminal plates and resilient clamps, said couplings are placed on the housing, thus enabling the connection terminals to be fixed to the switch in a stable, manner, and offering the advantage of preventing the switch from being deformed with respect to the bus bars.<br>
